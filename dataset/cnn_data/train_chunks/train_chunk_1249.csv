"They may have suffered their worst season in Premier League history but Manchester United have rocketed into second place in a list of the world's wealthiest football clubs. Despite a campaign of turmoil, which saw David Moyes sacked as they struggled to adapt to life without Sir Alex Ferguson and finished seventh, United are behind only Real Madrid in the Deloitte's Football Money League. The Old Trafford outfit leapfrogged European superpowers Bayern Munich and Barcelona after their revenues rose from to £433.2m from £363.2m. Manchester United have moved up to second on the list despite not even being in the Champions League . Manchester United brought in more revenue for 2013-14 than any other club in the UK . Champions League winners Real Madrid are the wealthiest club in the world . Across town, Premier League champions Manchester City remain the second-richest English club, in sixth place globally behind Paris Saint Germain. League leaders Chelsea remain in seventh, ahead of Arsenal in eighth. Liverpool, no doubt buouyed by last season's ultimately unsuccessful title tilt, rise from 12th place to ninth overtaking Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan. United's rise is down to its rapid commercial growth, and with more deals announced this year they are expected to go from strength to strength despite the debt that remains from the 2005 Glazer takeover. In the 18th edition of the report, which uses figures sourced directly from each club and is put together by Manchester-based Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, City recorded the largest increase of any outfit in the top five - news Etihad bosses may see as a vindication of their methods. United broke the British transfer record to sign Angel di Maria from Real Madrid during the summer . They also spent £37m bringing Juan Mata to Manchester from Chelsea in January last year . Things weren't going well for David Moyes and United on the pitch but the opposite was true off it . The Premier League champions saw revenues rise from £271m to £346.5m a 28% increase. Thanks largely to the new broadcasting deals struck by the Premier League Newcastle United (19) and Everton (20) break into the top 20 for the first time. Spurs go up a place from 14th to 13th. In total English clubs make up five of the top 10 and eight of the top 20 – more than any other country. Dan Jones, partner at Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, said: “It was a very successful year for the North West clubs. No other region in the world has as many clubs in the top 20 and these clubs play a major role in the North West economy. 'Last year Premier League clubs benefitted from much larger broadcast revenues thanks to the latest round of deals. The Premier League is currently undertaking its next round of sales of broadcast rights and with the market expectation that another significant increase will occur, it is likely that the Money League will have a strongly English appearance in the coming years.' 1.

"When Tony Pulis and Steve Parish toasted Crystal Palace’s momentous comeback against Liverpool in the manager’s office last season, they appeared to be a formidable partnership. Pulis had rescued Palace, taking over when they had only four points and steered them to an incredible 11th-place finish. That night, after they had kept Palace in the Premier League, they spoke about their dreams for the future. On Thursday night, after six hours of talks in a central London office, the pair accepted their relationship is unworkable. It is incredible that it has come to this, less than 48 hours before their opening Barclays Premier League game of the season at Arsenal. Dave Kemp, Pulis’s assistant, will take charge for the Arsenal game, but will leave after the match. Coach Keith Millen, inherited from the previous management team, will stay on with Malky Mackay wanted to take over. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the players that Pulis wanted but the club didn't support . Shock! Tony Pulis has left Crystal Palace after disagreements with the club's owner Steve Parish . Reinforcements: Tony Pulis wanted to bring in the likes of (L-R) Gylfi Sigurdsson, Steven Caulker and Michu . This is a crisis, just three months after the ‘Miracle of Crystanbul’ and that incredible comeback to draw from 3-0 down against Liverpool. Pulis wanted players — specifically Michu, Steven Caulker and Gylfi Sigurdsson — to help keep Palace up for another season. All three are on £40,000-plus a week and Palace are not used to spending big. Miracle of Crystanbul: Dwight Gale celebrates after a 3-0 comeback ends Liverpool's title hopes last season . Where Eagles dare: Crystal Palace fans show their appreciation to Tony Pulis for keeping them up . They are awash with Premier League cash, with record profits last season, and were prepared to back Pulis with the biggest transfer budget in the club’s history. It is still there to spend. But Pulis wanted to take charge of all the incoming transfers after the team responded to his methods when he replaced Ian Holloway. He gets results. So, too, does co-chairman Parish. He is the former owner and chief executive of TAG, one of the world’s biggest marketing and communications agencies. Parish is one of four cautious co-owners, each with a 25 per cent stake and all Palace fans. They will not blow the budget. Untenable: Palace owner Steve Parish and Tony Pulis once shared an excellent working  relationship . Two previous owners — Mark Goldberg and Simon Jordan — took huge risks in an attempt to turn Palace into one of the biggest clubs in the country. On both occasions, they ended up in administration. Parish wants to redevelop Selhurst Park and Palace at his own pace but losing the manager is a massive blow. Pulis is immensely proud that he has never been relegated as a boss. He achieved something special last season, brought in after a disastrous start under Holloway. He is old school and this week, despite the fall-out with Parish, he continued to coach the team. In the summer, when he spent time in Brazil commenting on the World Cup for BBC 5 Live, Pulis believed he could build a team to compete in the top half but needed to make big summer signings. Incoming: Crystal Palace have signed Frazier Campbell (L) and Martin Kelly (R) this summer . Instead, Palace have yet to make any significant additions. Right back Martin Kelly arrived from Liverpool for a cut-price £1.5m and Fraizer Campbell was signed as a squad player earlier in the summer. Pulis wanted to strengthen the team in other areas as he prepared for his first full season in charge. Instead, before a ball has even been kicked, Palace are already looking for a new manager.

"Beef from cows that are infected with bovine tuberculosis could be being served in schools and hospitals, it has emerged. The Government has admitted that meat from 28,000 diseased cattle is sold every year to catering firms and some supermarkets. The Department for Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is believed to be making £10million a year selling the infected carcasses. Beef from cows infected with TB is being used to supply schools, hospitals and the military. File picture . Officials claim the risk of catching the illness from eating infected meat is ‘extremely low’. But Tesco has refused to sell the . beef due to public health concerns and Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Burger . King and McDonald’s have also chosen to ban it. Herds are checked for bovine TB every . one to four years. Any infected cattle are slaughtered, and the . Government pay farmers up to £1,700 per animal in compensation. Defra claims the tuberculosis virus (pictured) is extremely unlikely to be transmitted through the meat, even when it is uncooked . The meat is sold with no warning to processors or consumers that it comes from bTB infected cattle. File picture . DEFRA can then sell the meat on to catering firms, processors or supermarkets without providing any warning labels. It is not clear what companies have . bought the meat but Sodexo, Aramark and Compass – which supply food to . hospitals and schools – could not deny serving it. Around 70 Britons . become infected with bovine tuberculosis every year. The symptoms are similar to the more common ‘human’ form, which causes a severe cough, loss of appetite and weight loss. The human risk from bovine tuberculosis has been used to justify a cull of tens of thousands of badgers, which are believed to help spread the disease . Most people catch the illness by . consuming infected milk or beef or by coming into contact with diseased . cattle. The strain, which used to be very common, killed around 2,500 . Britons each year in the 1920s and 1930s. Many patients caught it from . infected milk. The Government subsequently introduced milk pasteurisation and the heating process now kills the bacteria carrying the disease. But the illness is on the rise in cattle, and experts are concerned it could soon become a health risk for humans again. The Food Standards Agency, which is . responsible for food safety, said if a cow was infected in one area of . its body then the rest of its meat was fit for consumption. Despite this, in 2005 one of DEFRA’s . own researchers – Ricardo de la Rua-Domenech – found meat from other . areas of the cow could still infect humans. The Government is so worried about . the threat bovine tuberculosis poses to humans that it has ordered the . cull of tens of thousands of badgers, who are thought to spread the . disease between cows. However Dr Lucy Thomas, from Public . Health England, stressed that the problem was not yet ‘widespread’ as . the ‘numbers now are very small’. And a DEFRA spokesman said: ‘All meat . from cattle slaughtered due to bovine TB must undergo rigorous food . safety checks before it can be passed fit for consumption. ‘The risk of infection from eating meat, even if raw or undercooked, remains extremely low.’","Meat from diseased animals being sold by farming ministry .

"Barcelona have agreed a £15million transfer fee with Arsenal to sign Thomas Vermaelen, in what will be a blow to Manchester United. The deal is now pending personal terms between Vermaelen's agent and the Nou Camp outfit before the deal can be finalised. On Wednesday, Barcelona sent transfer negotiator Raul Sanllehi to London  and he had productive talks offering a four-year contract, with the option of an extra year, worth £80,000 a week. Agreed: Barcelona look to have beaten Manchester United to signing Thomas Vermaelen . New surroundings? Barcelona look set to sign Vermaelen on a four-year deal worth £80,000 a week . No go: Arsenal wanted a swap deal involving United's Chris Smalling as opposed to a cash offer for Vermaelen .

Turned down: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger had hoped to secure the capture of Smalling in the Vermaelen deal . Sanllehi left feeling he had done enough to convince Arsenal and the player that Barcelona was his best option. They now believe the player is '99 per cent' theirs. The news will come as a blow to Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal, as United and Arsenal hit a stalemate over the proposed £15million purchase of Vermaelen on a three-year deal. Arsene Wenger is refusing to sell the Belgian defender to United unless a player comes in return with Chris Smalling top of his wishlist. Wenger has admired Smalling since he was a teenager at Fulham and made overtures to sign him before United stepped in to strike a deal in January 2010. The Greenwich-born centre-back opted for Old Trafford and even though he has only shown glimpses of his potential United want to keep him and see how he develops under Van Gaal. United's failed bid for Vermaelen will come as a blow to the player himself who was keen to continue playing in England. Keen to stay in England: Vermaelen is dating English model Parsons .

The stand-off means Barcelona now have the edge unless Vermaelen pushes for the move to United. United have made it clear they will better Barcelona's offer but, with Arsenal refusing to deal with them unless Smalling is included, the pressure is now on Vermaelen. His close friend Van Persie had the determination to push through a move to Old Trafford ahead of better offers but there is a sense Vermaelen will not take the same stance.

"A Fox & Friends host today spent just 13 seconds addressing a sick joke he made on Monday's show about the video of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice punching his fiancée in an elevator. 'The message is take the stairs!' Host Brian Kilmeade had quipped on Monday. The comment, which was made following a discussion about the footage showing the NFL running back  knocking his now-wife unconscious in February, drew sharp criticism. On Tuesday, Kilmeade addressed the quip - but fell short of apologizing. 'Comments we made during this story yesterday made some feel like we were taking the situation too lightly,' he said to the camera. 'We are not, we were not. Domestic violence is a very serious issue to us, I can assure you.' Scroll down for video . No apologies: on Tuesday, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade addressed a 'joke' he made about the video showing Ray Rice punching his wife on Monday, insisting they treat domestic violence seriously . Having a laugh: On Monday, Kilmeade (right) made his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman laugh with his sick quip: 'The message is take the stairs!' After he made the remark on Monday, his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman giggled before Doocy added: 'The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera' before smoothly segueing into a new report. The presenter's remarks led to outrage online. News and politics editor at Global Grind, Christina Coleman, tweeted today: 'Why am I not surprised? This is how Fox News handled #RayRice video.' Dan Murphy posted: 'If there's a more ghastly assemblage of callous mouthbreathers than Fox and Friends on TV I don't want to know.' Al Jazeera anchor Richelle Carey simply dubbed Kilmeade's remark as 'moronic'. On Monday, TMZ released the previously unseen footage filmed by a security camera inside the elevator in the Revel Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City in February. The video reveals the couple – who married a month later – engaged in a heated exchange as they entered the lift. Ex Ravens player Ray Rice drew further criticism during a press conference with his wife in May, where she apologized, but he didn't say sorry to her for punching her in the face . Once inside Rice can clearly be seen to slap his girlfriend, before she hits him and the 5-foot, 8-inch, 220-pound athlete then punches her with such force that he knocks her off her feet. Janay then smashes her head on the elevator hand rail and falls unconscious to the floor. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's $40 million contract on Monday in the wake of the release. Minutes later, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice from the league indefinitely and said he would have to apply for reinstatement. The announcements follow hours of intense pressure on the Ravens and the NFL to give Rice a more appropriate punishment for brutally beating his now wife. NFL officials had sparked shock and outrage in July when they handed him just a two-game suspension and a $500,000 fine. In addition to his successful career in journalism at Fox, Kilmeade has been a stand-up comedian for ten years, according to his online bio.","Brian Kilmeade made light of the video showing the former Ravens player hitting his now-wife with his Fox & Friends co-hosts on Monday .

"Broken trust: Teresa Lee Cope, 34, former program director at the Birdseye Residential Treatment Center in Utah, was arrested for allegedly abusing a 15-year-old boy suffering from sexual behavior problems and addiction to pornography . A former official at a Utah treatment center for teenagers suffering from sexual behavior problems and pornography addiction is accused of abusing a 15-year-old resident. Teresa Lee Cope, 34, a married mother of two from Springville, was arrested last week on multiple charges, including sexual activity with a minor, unlawful custodial relations and sex abuse. The woman was released last Friday after her husband of six years posted $10,000 cash bail. According to her arrest affidavit cited by Deseret News, Mrs Cope worked as program director at the Birdseye Residential Treatment Center when she started an illicit affair with a 15-year-old boy on April 15, 2013, which lasted for more than month. The charging documents state that on at least three separate occasions, the couple kissed and touched one another at the boys' ranch. In one instance, the teenage patient was sexually assaulted by Cope at a car wash in Springville, according to investigators. The tryst culminated May 15, 2013, when the program director and her young charge had intercourse, police said. Utah County Sheriff's Sgt Spencer Cannon told the Salt Lake Tribune the married woman required her underage lover to perform sexual acts on her, and vice versa. 'Safe' place: Police say some of the sexual encounters between April and May 2013 took place at the boys' ranch in Spanish Fork, Utah . According to Cannon, Mrs Cope would 'manipulate' the situation to make her encounters with the 15-year-old possible. For example, during field trips, Cope and the boy would often drive together or find themselves alone, officials revealed. Odell Erickson, quality assurance director with Heritage Youth Services, which runs Birdseye Center, said that Cope was hired in June 2012 and quit last December. The official said Cope passed two separate background checks, which raised no red flags. The boy's family, from Cedar City, have known about the allegations for some time, according to Salt Lake attorney Greg Skordas, who was hired to represent them. Unlikely 'predator': Teresa Lee Cope is married and has two young daughtes (pictured right); her husband of six years, Jake Cope (right), posted her $10,000 cash bail last week . But it was not until two weeks ago that the 15-year-old approached his parents and told them about the alleged sexual abuse at the hands of the director. Sheriff’s deputies then executed a search warrant at Cope's Springville home, seizing electronic devices and other physical evidence, including clothing, which allegedly helped corroborate the victim’s story. The 34-year-old woman married Jake Cope in 2008, according to the man’s Facebook account. The couple have two young daughters.","Teresa Lee Cope, 34, accused of carrying on affair for more than a month with a male patient at Birdseye Residential Treatment Center in Utah .

"President Obama has angered wealthy jet-setting New Yorkers with his travel plans this weekend because much of New York’s airspace will be shut down during his visit to the state. The timing of the President’s trip to New York's Westchester County today for a series of weekend fundraisers could not have come at a worst time because it will be during the Labor Day weekend.

Aviation: Melissa Tomkiel, president of the private aviation company Fly the Whale said several people were upset about being grounded by the President . 'They had plans, you know, several weeks ahead of time to get out to their vacations.’ She told CBS that the company expects to lose at least $10,000 while New York City airspace is shut down. ‘Labor Day in particular is important because it's at the end of the busy season of the summer,’ Tomkiel said. ‘So it's really our last chance to make as much as we can as a company and keep it in reserve for the slower months that are ahead.’ The temporary flight restrictions over New York City will have minimal impact on commercial flights. Most are already sold out, and are not an option for stranded passengers. However, on Fridays, as many as six flights an hour take off from a pier on Manhattan's east side.

"Britain is preparing to reopen its embassy in Iran in a dramatic thawing of relations between the West and Tehran. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the circumstances were right to restore the embassy, closed in 2011 after it was ransacked by an angry mob, insisting: 'Iran is an important country in a volatile region.' In another dramatic development, US secretary of state John Kerry indicated that the Obama administration is 'open to discussions' with Tehran if the Iranians can help end the violence and restore confidence in the Iraqi government. Scroll down for videos . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the circumstances were right to reopen the UK embassy in Tehran, as US secretary of state John Kerry indicated that the Obama administration is 'open to discussions' with Iran . The need for closer working with Iran comes amid the deepening crisis in Iraq, where jihadist militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) have seized several major cities. In a fresh worrying development, pictures have emerged of children taking up arms in Iraq against the Isis threatening to march on Baghdad. Images coming out of Iraq today show youths brandishing automatic rifles as they march with the militias forming in the capital to fight back against the forces of ISIS. The US has signalled it too could work with Iran in an extraordinary alliance to deal with the threat posed by the unrest in Iraq. Mr Hague spoke to Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday when significant progress was made on repairing relations. The Foreign Secretary stressed the ‘common interests’ with Iran, including stability in Iraq and in Afghanistan and tackling the drugs trade. Anti Shah rioters in Tehran attack the British Embassy in December 1978 . The British embassy in Tehran has long been the centre of tensions between the UK and Iran. In November 2011, under hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency, Iran announced it was expelling the UK's ambassador in retaliation for British support for tougher sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme. Hundreds of protesters stormed embassy compounds two days later, smashing windows, torching cars, burning Union Flags, and chanting: 'The embassy of Britain should be taken over',' and 'Death to England'. The riots had echoes of an uprising in 1979 uprising when the pro-Western Pahlavi dynasty was deposed and replaced with a theocratic regime. In 1980, six Iranian gunmen took 22 people hostage at the Iranian embassy in London. After a stand-off lasting six days, elite SAS troops stormed the building killing five gunmen and arresting another. One hostage was killed and two were injured. It was eight years before the UK government re-opened its embassy in Tehran. The rapprochement was short lived with diplomatic ties being severed again in 1989 when Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill British author Salman Rushdie in retaliation for his controversial novel The Satanic Verses. It took a decade for the embassy to be reopened. Today he announced said the 'circumstances are right' to restore the diplomatic base after a significant thawing in relations over recent months. 'Our two primary concerns when considering whether to reopen our embassy in Tehran have been assurance that our staff would be safe and secure, and confidence that they would be able to carry out their functions without hindrance,' Mr Hague told MPs in a written statement. 'There has never been any doubt in my mind that we should have an embassy in Tehran if the circumstances allowed. 'Iran is an important country in a volatile region, and maintaining embassies around the world, even under difficult conditions, is a central pillar of the UK's global diplomatic approach... 'I have therefore now decided the circumstances are right to reopen our embassy in Tehran.' However, the UK remains concerned about Iran's nuclear programme and its sponsorship of terrorism. David Cameron later rejected the idea that the diplomatic rapprochement was connected to the crisis in Iraq. Speaking at a press conference in Downing Street, he said: 'Britain believes in and I believe in step by step building our relationship with Iran because we need to have proper dialogue with that country. 'We are having dialogue over the nuclear weapons issue and I think we should be having dialogue with it on issues of regional security,' the premier said. 'Obviously our relationship was at a low point after the appalling things that happened with respect to our embassy, but it is right step by step with a clear eye with a hard head, to rebuild that relationship. 'Now we would be doing that anyway irrespective of what is happening in Iraq, but I think what is happening in Iraq is certainly not a reason for not taking that step.' It came amid reports that Tehran is considering military support to the Shia-led administration in Iraq. Representatives of Iran and the Western powers met in Vienna to discuss international concerns about Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. In the Commons yesterday, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘There is now an urgent case for ensuring an effective British diplomatic presence in Tehran to help co-ordinate discussions and to advance dialogue.’ Mr Hague said he had discussed 'a number of matters, including the situation in Iraq' with Iranian counterpart Mr Zarif. Britain has not had a diplomatic presence in Tehran since 2011, when an angry mob ransacked offices and carried away a royal coat of arms . The anti-British protests saw flags burned in the street outside the embassy in November 2011 . Mr Hague spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday to discuss taking further steps on improving bilateral relations . 'He said that there was a case for a further step forward in our bilateral relations. 'I have discussed that with him, and I shall have something more to say about our discussions imminently,' Mr Hague told MPs. 'However, our work on that is distinct from discussions on Iraq, which is partly why I shall address those separately.' Meanwhile, US secretary of state John Kerry has indicated that the Obama administration is willing to talk with Iran over the deteriorating security conditions in Iraq. The president announced last night that around 275 US military personnel could deploy to Iraq to provide support and security for the US embassy and its staff in Baghdad. Mr Kerry said in an interview with Yahoo! News that Washington is 'open to discussions' with Tehran if the Iranians can help end the violence and restore confidence in the Iraqi government. He said he would not rule out military co-operation, and a senior US official revealed American and Iranian diplomats have already discussed the Iraq issue during nuclear talks in Austria. Mr Kerry said: 'We're open to discussions if there is something constructive that can be contributed by Iran, if Iran is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of Iraq and ability of the government to reform.' On military co-operation, Mr Kerry said: 'At this moment, I think we need to go step-by-step and see what in fact might be a reality. But I would not rule out anything that would be constructive in providing real stability, a respect for the constitution, a respect for the election process and a respect for the ability of the Iraqi people to form a government that represents all the interests of Iraq. 'We are open to any constructive process here that would minimise the violence.'

"France is braced for a Muslim backlash after its government backed the publication of cartoons depicting a wheelchair-bound Prophet Muhammad being pushed by a rabbi. It will close 20 embassies and schools across Islamic countries tomorrow, and has warned its citizens abroad to take care.

Waiting for the storm: Riot police stand guard outside the offices of Parisian weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo after it published crude caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad . Tensions running high: The cartoons in the satirical publication made reference to the U.S.-made anti-Islam film which has sparked violence around the world . However, he defended freedom of expression, adding that the fundamental right could only be limited ‘by court decisions’.

"The BBC may have embarked on some of the most dramatic cost-cutting in its history, but it seems there is still some way to go. There are almost 4,500 job titles in existence at the Corporation, it has emerged, and almost 2,000 of its staff have the word manager in their title. It is thought there are even more staff on top of this who are classed as and paid as managers but do not have the word in their job titles. BBC Television Centre: Within the Corporation's News department alone there are more than 1,000 job titles . The broadcaster, which has long been . accused of having too many middle and senior managers, also employs 191 . staff with the word ‘adviser’ in the title. Following . a Freedom of Information request, the BBC has also admitted that 44 . members of staff have the word ‘strategy’ in their job role. Within its . news department alone there are more than 1,000 job titles, another 700 . in its TV department and nearly 500 in radio. ‘Families struggling to pay their . licence fee on top of so many other bills, and expecting it to be spent . on things like making programmes, will be worried that too much of their . money is going on a bloated management structure’ TAXPAYERS' ALLIANCE . There . could be significantly more roles because the figures only refer to BBC . staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts and do not include casual . workers, or jobs at its commercial arm or BBC World News. Yesterday . critics said the figures showed the BBC was still wasting large amounts . of money ‘on sustaining a massive bureaucracy’. The . area with the second highest number of job titles – 918 – was the . Corporation’s operations group and executive support projects, which is . not involved with programme making. This part of the business is in charge of areas such as strategy, policy, distribution, property, legal affairs and looking after the organisation’s buildings. As of October 7, 2011, there were 4,420 job titles at the Corporation with 1,894 staff having the word ‘manager’ in their job title. A BBC spokesman defended the number of different roles, claiming that the title manager is ‘generally used to reflect a particular level of experience and seniority within the BBC rather than someone who actually manages a team of people’. One BBC insider said: ‘Some of the titles you come across are just absurd and are beyond belief. ‘There always seems to be a lot of managers swilling around – I am not sure how busy they are.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is fresh evidence to support longstanding concerns that the BBC is wasting huge amounts of money sustaining a massive bureaucracy. ‘Families struggling to pay their licence fee on top of so many other bills, and expecting it to be spent on things like making programmes, will be worried that too much of their money is going on a bloated management structure.’ The news comes after the BBC promised last year that it was banning baffling job titles and would make it clearer to the public what staff are doing. Last month, BBC chief operating officer Caroline Thomson was asked on Newsnight why when the Corporation wanted to put money into programmes it was at the same time trying to recruit a ‘decision support analyst’ on £58,000 a year. She admitted: ‘I don’t know what that person actually does but what I do say is that you want the BBC to be a well-managed organisation.’","1,000 job titles in the news department, 700 in TV and 500 in radio .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists he can lead the club to a Premier League title - perhaps as soon as this season. Rodgers' side were in pole position for last season's title until Steven Gerrard's costly slip gifted Chelsea victory at Anfield, and when they then let a three-goal lead slip against Crystal Palace it allowed Manchester City to take the eventual honours.

"Hospitals have been told to end the ‘unacceptable’ practice of sending thousands of frail patients home late at night or in the early hours. An analysis of figures from around half of England’s NHS trusts showed that more than 150,000 patients, including 18,500 over the age of 75, were recorded as being discharged from hospital between 11pm and 6am in the past year. One stroke victim was sent home in freezing temperatures in the early hours without a coat and was later discovered by police wandering around a cricket pitch. Hospitals have been told to end the ¿unacceptable¿ practice of sending thousands of frail patients home late at night or in the early hours . Senior doctors questioned the figures – saying they may include patients being transferred or those sent home earlier in the day but only recorded as being discharged at night when nurses complete the paperwork. Nonetheless, NHS England says the practice is unacceptable and that patients should be discharged only if they want to go home and it is safe for them to do so. Campaigners say hospitals are under pressure to discharge patients at night so they can free up beds for more urgent cases coming from A&E units. Dr Mike Smith, chairman of the Patients Association, said: ‘They have people in A&E lying in corridors, they have got to be admitted and they have no beds. ‘It’s for the convenience of staff and the person they are admitted but at the gross detriment to the person they are chucking out.’ NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh told hospitals to end the practice two years ago . Concerns have also been raised that dementia patients are being sent back to care homes at times when the staff on duty are unable to notify the homes of possible changes in care. Nadra Ahmed, chairman of the National Care Association, said: ‘They are going back without any relevant information about what the diagnosis might have been because people are off duty.’ NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh told hospitals to end the practice two years ago but the latest figures – obtained by Sky News – suggest that in half of trusts the problem has actually got worse. Among the 72 trusts that supplied figures – out of 160 – there had been no improvement over the past two years in the number of patients discharged between 11pm and 6am – 152,479 in 2013/14. At 41 of the trusts the number had increased. In one case, Michael Atkinson, 64, who had suffered a stroke, was discharged from the A&E unit at Royal Bolton Hospital at 3.30am. He was later found in a cricket field in sub-zero temperatures in a confused state. The hospital said he left before transport could be arranged but has since undertaken a review to find out why he was discharged at that time. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Discharging patients at night without appropriate support is unacceptable, particularly if a patient is vulnerable. Where a patient wishes to leave late at night it should be accommodated only where it is clinically appropriate and with the support of family, friends or carers. ‘The decision to do this should always be based on what is best for the patient.’ Dr Mark Temple, of the Royal College of Physicians, who works at Heartlands hospital in Birmingham, queried the data. ‘We need to know whether this is the time when patients are actually leaving hospital or whether it is when nurses are getting round to recording their discharge on the system.’ He added that it might also include patients being allowed to go home from A&E or medical assessment units having been rushed in during the night with a possible heart attack.","18,500 people over 75 discharged between 11pm and 6am in the past year .

"Morgan Schneiderlin remains determined to leave Southampton and boss Ronald Koeman has revealed the France international is making life difficult at St Mary's. Tottenham lead the chase for the £27m-rated central midfielder, but the South Coast club are determined to hold onto one of their key layers after a summer sale which has seen a number of their top players leave. Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren have all departed and Saints chiefs are determined to stop the flow of talent out of the club which began when ex-boss Mauricio Pochettino joined Spurs in May. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Fonte: New contract and Schneiderlin's likely departure . On the move? Morgan Schneiderlin (left) remains determined to leave Southampton . Koeman said: 'We spoke to him this morning - the situation is difficult because the player makes it difficult. 'But the situation hasn't changed. We won't sell him. He isn't in the squad tomorrow because he says he isn't in a place to play. 'So we've given him the weekend off and Monday he has to come back.' One piece of good news for the Dutch boss is the news defender Jose Fonte has signed a new deal with the club. Portuguese defender Fonte, 30, has pledged his future to the St Mary's outfit and will remain until at least 2017. Boiling point: New Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes Schneiderlin is making things 'difficult' 'We are very happy because we like to keep the good players and the experienced players,"" Koeman said. 'Jose is the captain for this season on the field. We have another captain of the club - Kelvin Davis - but Jose is the captain on the pitch. 'I am very pleased about his new contract, which shows our ambition and the philosophy of the club and I am happy about that.' Fonte said: 'I'm very excited to be signing this new contract for another three years. This is where I feel at home.

"Parents are damaging their children’s literacy by abandoning reading with them too soon - typically by the age of seven - according to research. Around two-thirds of six year olds enjoy bedtime stories or other recreational reading with an adult. But that plummets to 44 per cent among children who are just a year older as mothers and fathers assume their help is no longer needed. A survey of 1,000 children by Oxford University Press found around two-thirds of six year olds said they enjoy reading with an adult. Yet, that figure plummets to 44 per cent among children who are just a year older. Half of eight and nine year olds were rarely or never read to at home . More than nine in ten parents were . regularly read stories as a child, according to research released . earlier this month by online family retailer Littlewoods.com. But . many admitted they were often too busy or too stressed to do the same . for their children, or found they preferred watching television or . playing computer games. Additional research from The . National Literacy Trust found . pupils are 13 times more likely to read above the expected level for . their age if they enjoy books for pleasure. A . spokeswoman for the trust said: ‘Parents . are really important reading role models and our research shows that . children’s attitudes to reading improve the more they see their parents . read, so we’d encourage all parents to make time for enjoying a good . book themselves.’ Yet experts said continuing to read together for pleasure throughout primary school was ‘vital’ for their development. And nearly half of young ‘reluctant readers’ said they would enjoy reading more if their parents sat with them. The findings, in a survey by Oxford University Press, follow studies which show children who read for pleasure are more likely to do well at school and thrive in the work place. James Clements, a former headteacher at an outstanding primary school who worked with OUP on the study, said: ‘All the research proves that reading for pleasure is inextricably linked to attainment and benefits all aspects of children’s lives. ‘Parents need to understand the huge impact reading with their children can make and how vital it is that reading for pleasure doesn’t stop at the school gate but is continued at home. ‘Just ten minutes of reading with their child every day is one of the best ways they can support their education. ‘Reading together six days a week means an extra hour of support for a child. It’s definitely cheaper than an hour with a tutor and it could make a much bigger difference.’ Additional research from The National Literacy Trust found pupils are 13 times more likely to read above the expected level for their age if they enjoy books for pleasure, while children who don't enjoy reading may struggle academically . The survey of 1,000 children aged seven to 11 also found half of eight and nine year olds were rarely or never read to at home. Just a third of ten year olds spent time reading books with an adult. Clements said tips to keep children interested in reading throughout primary school include exposing them to a variety of books, taking it in turns to read, ensuring the child understand new words and discussing the plot.

"Alex Salmond tonight mocked Labour leader Ed Miliband for claiming the first thing he thought when he saw a white van and England flags was ‘respect’. The former Scottish First Minister, accepting an award for ‘politician of the year’, took out a hanky emblazoned with the cross of St George, pretending to wipe away tears. After dabbing his he held out the hanky in front of him before quipping: 'I'm quite overcome by this award. I look at this hanky and I say to myself the only word that comes to mind is ""respect"".' Alex Salmond accepted the award for politician of the year at the Spectator magazine awards in Savoy today . The glittering awards bash was held at the Savoy Hotel in London this afternoon . The joke came after Mr Miliband forced the shadow frontbencher Emily Thornberry to resign after sending a ‘sneering’ tweet about a terraced home draped in England flags. In the wake of the furore the Labour leader was asked what he thought when he saw a white van. He responded: ‘Respect.’ In his acceptance speech at the Spectator magazine’s awards, Mr Salmond said the last 12 months had been ‘momentous’ for Scotland. The former Scottish first minister won the honour despite the failure of the Yes campaign to secure independence in September's referendum. But the level of support for leaving the UK was higher than many had predicted, with the campaign helping to re-energise political debate north of the border. In the wake of the referendum, SNP membership has soared from 25,000 to more than 92,000, while new proposals to hand Holyrood increased powers over income tax, welfare and other areas have been drawn up in a cross-party deal. Mr Salmond said he was ‘honoured’ to receive the award for a second time, having previously been recognised in 2011 after the SNP's landslide win in the Scottish elections. The former SNP leader said: ‘This has been a momentous year for Scotland and, while the Yes campaign may not have won in the referendum, there is no doubt that Scotland has been changed utterly. ‘With the SNP now the third biggest party in the UK with more than twice as many members as the Lib Dems, and support for the party surging in the polls, there is a determination in Scotland to ensure that real progress is delivered.’ Mr Salmond, who is considering standing to become an MP, received his award from the Home Secretary Theresa May . SNP depute leader Stewart Hosie stated: ‘The last year has undoubtedly been an incredible one for both Scotland and the UK as the shape of Scotland's future was decided and the political landscape of our country was transformed. ‘Throughout 2014 Alex Salmond has been at the heart of those events, playing a key role in the inspiring Yes campaign that got so many people involved in politics for the first time. ‘Alex Salmond may now have stepped down as first minister of Scotland but his impact on Scottish and UK politics is one that is recognised by people of all political persuasions and none. ‘That is undoubtedly why he has once again been selected as the Spectator's Politician of the Year and I warmly congratulate him on his success.’","Ex SNP leader made jibe after accepting award for 'politician of the year'

Maloney revealed she has felt trapped in the wrong body ever since she was a child. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, she said: 'I can’t keep living in the shadows, that is why I am doing what I am today. Living with the burden any longer would have killed me.' The 61-year-old admits the pressure and confusion caused by her struggles with her identity caused battles with drink, depression and drugs and has been secretly receiving counselling and therapy. Kellie says she kept her turmoil in the shadows because she feared a backlash from the notoriously macho world of boxing. 'I have never been able to tell anyone in boxing,' she added. 'Can you imagine me walking into a boxing hall dressed as a woman and putting an event on?' Kellie is now over a year into the transition period before surgery and in the past two years she has secretly undergone hormone therapy, hair removal and voice coaching.

There’s a lot more to it than scoring goals but it helps massively and if you’ve got that natural instinct then you’re on to a winner. ‘It is hard not to look back five years, when I was training for Poole on a Tuesday and Thursday, and not pinch myself but my family keep my feet on the ground and remind me of what it was like beforehand.’ Role model: Rickie Lambert has followed a similar route to play for Champiuons League team Liverpool . Danny Wilson was the Swindon manager who took a chance on the young striker who had been released by Reading and hopped from Kintbury Rangers to Hungerford Town before joining Poole in the Wessex League, the ninth tier of English football. ‘I remember it well,’ said Wilson. ‘It was teeming down with rain and I could have gone home after half an hour. I liked what I saw. He was always in the right areas at the right time. He was brave, flinging himself at the ball, putting defenders under pressure. He was quite raw but you could see there was something to work on. More than that, he just had a natural instinct and was a massive threat. Bournemouth had been looking closely, but they were struggling financially at the time, so we went in and did a deal.’ Austin was 20 at the time. He scored the winner at Carlisle on his first start in November 2009, the winner against Huddersfield three days later and the winner against Leyton Orient on his next appearance. By the end of the season he had 20 goals and Swindon were at Wembley in the play-off final, which they lost to Millwall. Charlie Austin will turn out for Queens Park Rangers after spells at Poole, Swindon and Burnley . Sharp shooter: Charlie Austin has had a prolific record throughout his career . Gamble: Danny Wilsom took a chance by signing Charlie Austin for Swindon . ‘He was never fazed by it,’ said Wilson. ‘He uses his body well and is never looking for the perfect goal. He’s happy to finish early, which surprises defenders and goalkeepers. ‘There’s no reason at all why he can’t keep doing it in the Premier League. If he thinks the opportunity is there, he’ll try to score.’ Burnley bought Austin for £1million, then sold him to QPR for £4.5m last year and Ings stepped into the void, forging a prolific partnership with Sam Vokes. Ings was released by Southampton as a teenager and picked up by Bournemouth, who gave him a three-month contract and sent him on loan to Dorchester Town in the Conference South (tier six). Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe was impressed by his development, rewarding Ings with a longer deal and returning to sign him for £1m when he moved to Burnley and earned an England Under 21 call-up. He was last season’s Championship Player of the Year. Vardy’s journey is equally startling. Released by Sheffield Wednesday, he worked in factories and played for £30 a game for Stocksbridge Park Steels, helping them climb into the Northern Premier Division (tier seven). MVP: Danny Ings was voted last season's Championship Player of the Year after arriving from Bournemeouth . Come along: Burnley manager Eddie Howe brought Danny Ings with him when he moved from Bournemouth . While there, he was convicted of assault after a pub fight and played wearing an electronic tag, dashing home after games to comply with a 6pm curfew. ‘I’m not proud of what happened but it happened,’ said Vardy. ‘I’ve turned my life round.’ Halifax manager Neil Aspin refused to listen to those warning him to keep away from Vardy and nagged his chairman to pay £15,000 to sign him. ‘It was a big gamble for us,’ said Aspin. ‘He turned up for training and we were running around a track and he didn’t have the right running shoes. He didn’t look like a footballer but as soon as they saw him play, everyone knew he was special. He had unbelievable pace off the mark, he could play either side, chased back and worked so hard. He never caused me any trouble and was popular in the dressing-room.’ In little more than a year, Halifax had won the Northern Premier League and sold Vardy to Fleetwood in a deal which would be worth more than £500,000 once the Yorkshire club had banked their share of the sell-on from his £1m transfer to Leicester in 2012. ‘I always thought he was good enough to play in the Championship, but he had to make the step to Fleetwood, where he took the Conference by storm,’ said Aspin. Fox in the box: Jamie Vardy was signed by Leicester for £1m after playing for Halifax and Fleetwood . Stat's impressive! Jamie Vardy scored 34 goals in 40 games for lower league side Fleetwood . Vardy scored 34 in 40 games as Fleetwood were promoted to the Football League as champions. ‘There’s no reason why he can’t do it in the Premier League. He’s got the desire and the pace. He’s still new to full-time training, so he’s improving. He will do well. I’m pleased it’s worked out for him.’ At 27, Vardy is the eldest of the trio, but Lambert was 30 on his Premier League debut and a year older when winning his first cap. The precedent is set for three Englishmen born to score as they embark on the biggest season of their lives. It is about attitude and desire. It is about seizing the chance.

"Award winning actress Samantha Morton, who is set to speak to police over allegations she was sexually abused while living in a Nottinghamshire care home . Award-winning actress Samantha Morton is set to speak to police over claims she suffered sexual abuse at the hands of care home workers. The Golden Globe and Bafta winner, who spent most of her childhood living in institutions in Nottingham, spoke out last month saying she was abused by two male residential home workers when she was just 13. She said that the abuse was reported to both the police and social services but neither was investigated. Now the 37-year-old has agreed to be formally interviewed by officers, who could be set to launch an investigation after the claims surrounding the now closed Red Tile Home in Nottinghamshire. The actress had previously revealed she had recently spoken to Nottinghamshire Police about her original complaint and was told the report contained only a reference to 'frolicking' and no sexual abuse. However, a force spokesman today confirmed: 'We have agreed a date and time towards the end of this month to meet with the individual concerned to discuss the matter.' The double-Oscar nominee said she decided to waive her right to anonymity in the wake of a report detailing sexual exploitation of 1,400 children over a period of 16 years in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. She told the Guardian that she was subjected to abuse by two different perpetrators during her time in care, but was too embarrassed to report her plight straight away. She explained: 'I was embarrassed and the people that did what they did to me... I thought they were really nice people, so I was actually really shocked when it happened.' The actress added: 'I just wanted to go public with this, to say, we know it's rife but why are there not further investigations into other areas? It isn't just Rotherham, I'm sure it's not just Rotherham. Miss Morton at an awards ceremony, left, and in a TV  adaptation of Jane Eyre, right. The actress said she was subjected to abuse by two different male workers at the Red Tiles Home in Nottinghamshire, which is now closed . 'A lot of people who abused my friends were people in very, very top jobs within the social services. Nottingham in the 80s was rife with that.' Police are also said to be looking into claims about historic abuse at nine homes across Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. A Nottinghamshire County Council spokesman has also said they were hoping to speak to Miss Morton about her concerns. The actress, pictured in the film In America, said she decided to waive her right to anonymity in the wake of a report detailing sexual exploitation of 1,400 children in Rotherham . In 2009 the double Oscar-nominee, who also starred alongside Tom Cruise in Minority Report, backed a Government campaign to recruit social workers in the wake of the Baby P scandal. Speaking then Miss Morton said she experienced some 'wonderful' social workers who supported her and helped her realise her ambitions. She said: ''My early life from infancy to leaving home at 16 was spent in care. I had some wonderful social workers who supported me and helped me achieve my goals in life. 'There are many people out there, whether they be children, families, vulnerable adults, even the aged who need a social worker.'","Actress has agreed to meet with officers to speak about abuse she suffered .

"It is a fascinating blend of well-trodden history and social mobility. Clustered around a Chippendale sofa in the sunbathed Morning Room of Clarence House, this new group photograph of the Windsor and Middleton dynasties is arguably the most intriguing of the christening portraits released yesterday. Despite the Queen’s presence and the rather Victorian familial grouping, there is a decidedly relaxed air to the picture, a portrait of a Royal Family for the modern age. Indeed, aside from the Queen, the most magisterial figure is the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger brother James, whose beard makes him look uncannily like his nephew’s great, great, great-grandfather, King George V, or even a younger looking Prince Michael of Kent. Scroll down for video . The official portrait for the christening of Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge, photographed in The Morning Room at Clarence House in London yesterday . Joyful: Prince George appears happy and healthy with his mother and father, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Kate’s family - her former air hostesses turned multi-millionaire entrepreneur mother, Carole, genial father Michael, and scene-stealing sister, Pippa - are positioned around Prince William. In contrast Kate, whose ancestors were Durham coal miners and men of the soil, is grouped with the rest of the Royal Family - a dapper-looking Duke of Edinburgh, belying his 92 years and recent ill-health, grandparents Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, and a cheeky-looking doting uncle Prince Harry. One can only assume that celebrity photographer Jason Bell, whose previous subjects have included David Beckham and actress Scarlett Johansson, diplomatically chose to place them that way rather than give an impression of ‘them and us’. Proud parents William and Kate also pose for a charming frame by themselves with their son. And as royal waves go, it isn’t a bad effort. Indeed, at the age of just three months His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge shows a heartening enthusiasm for what will become a royal stock in trade. Four generations: The current monarch, surrounded by Britain's three future figureheads . Sat up on his delighted mother’s lap, his adorably chubby cheeks peeking out from the voluminous swathes of his Honiton lace christening gown, the new third in line to the throne is an unquestionably bonny lad. Dressed in ruffled cream Alexander Queen and a Jane Taylor hat, his mother looks beautiful - as usual - although on closer inspection her eyes bear the battlescar bags so familiar of all new mothers. William is clearly a proud dad and, leaning close in to his wife, a proud husband too. But unlike his first official snapshot, so memorably taken by his grandfather, Michael Middleton, on a humble ‘sureshot’ in the family back garden, this first portrait is a more stilted affair. The portraits were taken in The Morning Room at Clarence House, which was once the Breakfast Room in John Nash’s original design for the Duke of Clarence in 1825. It is an elegant drawing room whose windows allow the light to flood in, bathing its occupants and furniture in a flattering glow. The christening group is seated around a sofa which is part of a much-admired suite of gilt-wood seat furniture by Thomas Chippendale which dates from about 1773. It is thought to have been commissioned by George III’s brother (the Duke of Gloucester) and was in the Royal Collection by the Reign of George IV. On the cabinet visible to the left of the sofa is a bronze bust of Princess Elizabeth made by William Lamb in 1933. A matching bust of Princess Margaret is on the opposite side of the room. On the wall above this cabinet to the left of the sofa is a portrait painted in oil ‘Their Royal Highnesses The Princess Elizabeth and The Princess Margaret in Windsor Great Park’, 1945, by Frederic Whiting. There are also two photographs, alternatively visible in the images. One is of The Prince of Wales and Prince Harry in a Zulu Village - South Africa 1997. Charles took his youngest son to the country in his half-term holiday of October that year following the tragic death of his mother just weeks earlier. A further photograph of Prince Harry is also visible on a side table. On the rear wall to the left of the window there is an oil on canvas painting entitled: ‘A Conversation Piece at Aintree: King George V and his Racing Manager’, c.1927-30, by Walter Richard Sickert. Beneath this is a painting by Laurence Stephen Lowry entitled ‘A Flyde Farm’, 1943. On the rear wall to the right of the window is an oil on canvas painting entitled: ‘When Homer Nods: Portrait of George Bernard Shaw’ by Augustus Edwin John, 1915. Beneath this is an oil on canvas painting entitled “The Lighthouse, Newhaven” by Duncan James Grant, c1939. Clarence House is currently the official residence of Prince Charles and his wife, who moved in following the Queen Mother’s death in 2002.

"The remains of Gerry and Mary Menke have been formally identified by forensic experts . Forensic experts have formally identified the first remains of Australian victims of the MH17 disaster as Victorian-based couple Mary and Gerry Menke. The couple were among the 298 people killed when the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was downed over insurgent-held eastern Ukraine on July 17. The Menke family said in a statement on Friday they were 'relieved' that Mary and Gerry had been identified. 'We look forward to receiving Mary and Gerry again soon in the place and the community they loved so much and which loved them. 'We wish to thank all those who have helped in this process,' the family said. Gerry and Mary Menke ran a successful abalone pearl company in Mallacoota, Victoria. Mrs Menke also operated a hairdressing and beauty studio with her daughter. It is understood they were returning home to Mallacoota after celebrating Gerry's 70th birthday in France when the plane was shot down. In a statement released by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Menkes' family said 'they will be remembered by everyone who knew them for the vivacity and spirit with which they lived.' 'They were inseparable partners in everything they did, loyal friends, deeply loving siblings and children, devoted parents to four children and doting grandparents to five grandsons.' The couple (pictured) are the first of 38 Australian victims to have been identified nearly a month after the plane crash . The site of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash. The plane was shot down over Eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian militants, killing all 298 people on board . Gerry Menke was from the Netherlands, born in Hilversum in 1944.  He was one of six siblings who immigrated to Australian in 1953.The 70-year-old's fascination with the ocean from a young age led to a successful and lifelong career in the abalone industry, in which he was a diver for 35 years before focusing his efforts on the pearl business. Mary came from Bignell in rural Christchurch and was working in an Australian pub when she met Gerry during her working holiday around the country. She was 65-years-old. 'Mary was a woman as colourful in spirit as she was in appearance,' the Menke family said. 'Her easy smile and laugh were as bright as the shock of blonde curls piled on her head.' After a 'whirlwind romance', the couple were married in Mary's home country of New Zealand and 'rarely spent a day apart', said family. The family of Mary (pictured front centre) and Gerry (back centre) have expressed their relief at the identification of the couple . Mary and Gerry are survived by their four children - Sara, Brett, Anna and Paul - along with their extended families. The Menke family sent their deepest condolences to those affected by the tragedy. Dutch forensic experts have so far identified 127 victims. Most of the identified victims have been Dutch but other nationalities have been publicly revealed, including from Malaysia, UK, New Zealand, Canada, Belgium and Germany. It is Australian government policy to keep the nationality of formally identified Australian victims secret unless the family is happy for it to be published. A total of 38 Australians were killed in the disaster.","Mary and Gerry Menke were among the 298 people killed on July 17 .

"'Judged': Anna Brown, 29, complained of leg pains, which were later found to have been caused by blood clots that led to her death . A homeless woman who refused to leave hospital without treatment for her sprained ankle was arrested and then died on the floor of a police cell. Anna Brown, 29, visited three hospitals in St Louis, Missouri, complaining of leg pain, which was later found to have been caused by the blood clots that killed her. She was arrested at St Mary's Health Center for trespassing and wheeled out of  the emergency room in handcuffs after a doctor said she was healthy enough to be locked up. Police accused her of having taken drugs and dragged her by the arms into the station, where they laid her on the floor of a jail cell. The clots later migrated to her lungs and killed her, according to an autopsy reported on in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. She had no drugs in her system. Miss Brown's family said she had died because people 'passed judgment' and have hired a lawyer, Keith Link - . who has not responded to messages seeking comment. St Mary's said in a . statement yesterday that its staff followed medical guidelines and . performed appropriate tests. 'Unfortunately, even with appropriate . testing using sophisticated technology, blood clots can still be . undetected in a small number of cases,' said the hospital, which acknowledged the 'outrage being expressed about this tragic event.' A . spokeswoman declined an interview request, citing patient privacy laws. Miss Brown told the arresting officers she . could not get out of the car because she could not put pressure on her . legs, so they dragged her into the station, according to . surveillance tapes. Their report listed her physical state as 'suspected drug . use' and noted that she had 'unknown leg pain'. Detained: Miss Brown was wheeled out of St Mary's Health Center in handcuffs after a doctor said she was healthy enough to be arrested . Her condition worsened at the station, and officers carried . her by the arms and legs into a prison cell, laid her on her back on the . floor and left. Fifteen minutes later, a jail worker found her cold to . the touch. Miss Brown's north St Louis home was destroyed in a tornado on New Year's Eve 2010, triggering a chain of unhappy events. She and her two children moved to Berkeley, a St Louis suburb, and she lost her job at a sandwich shop soon afterwards. Her utilities were shut off because she stopped paying her bills, and a child welfare agent who visited the home in April found a faeces-filled toilet and burn marks on the floor where she had lit fires to keep warm. Miss Brown was arrested for parental neglect and police reported that she was not lucid and seemed confused. Her mother, Dorothy Davis, got custody of Miss Brown's children on the condition that Miss Brown did not also live with them, and the 29-year-old's home was condemned. She lived in homeless shelters from May until September. Ms Davis, who said Miss Brown called every day to check on her children, said she wants answers about her daughter's death. 'If the police killed my daughter, I want to know. If the hospital is at fault, I want to know. I want to be able to tell her children why their mother isn't here,' said Ms Davis. Acting Police Chief Maj. Roy Wright said his officers had no way of knowing about Miss Brown's fatal condition. 'A lot of times people don't want to stay in jail and will claim to be sick,' he said. 'We depend on medical officials to tell us they're OK.' State inspectors working for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services - a federal agency that regulates hospitals - interviewed St Mary's staff and reviewed medical records after the Post-Dispatch asked about Miss Brown's case. They found that when the homeless woman arrived at St Mary's around 11.45am on September 20, her left ankle was swollen. She was there for about seven hours, during which time ultrasounds on both of her legs were negative for blood clots. Inspectors said she returned eight hours later and was discharged at 7am. Three hours later, she was still there and refusing to leave. After obtaining a 'Fit for Confinement' report from a doctor at 12.30pm, officers took her to jail. 'My sister is not here today because people passed judgment,' said one of her nine siblings, Krystle Brown.","Anna Brown visited three hospitals complaining of leg pain in days leading to death .

"A lack of exercise rather than diet is to blame for the obesity crisis, experts have warned. A new study in the U.S. found activity levels have fallen dramatically in the last 20 years as average body mass index (BMI) increased and calorie intake remained the same. Scientists said a drop in exercise and leisure time, especially among young women, may be responsible for rising obesity rates. It is recommended adults do 150 minutes of moderate exercise - brisk walking, cycling or gardening , for example - each week. A new study has revealed a lack of exercise is responsible for bulging waistlines and the obesity crisis, not calorie intake . But studies have shown around two in three adults in the UK fail to achieve the guidelines. Fewer manual jobs, more cars and home entertainment technology mean most people get much less exercise now than their parents or grandparents did. Two thirds of men and almost six in 10 women in the UK are overweight or obese. In Western Europe just Iceland and Malta have higher numbers of obese or overweight people. By analysing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) researchers found the number of U.S. women who reported no physical activity jumped from 19.1 per cent in 1994 to 51.7 per cent in 2010. For men, the number rose from 11.4 per cent to 43.5 per cent. During the period, average BMI has increased across the board, with the most dramatic rise found among young women between 18 and 39. Professor Uri Ladabaum, of Stanford University, California, said: 'These changes have occurred in the context of substantial increases in the proportion of adults reporting no leisure time physical activity, but in the absence of any significant population level changes in average daily caloric intake. 'At the population level, we found a significant association between the level of leisure time physical activity, but not daily caloric intake, and the increases in both BMI and waist circumference.' The research, carried out at the University of California, showed in 20 years BMI levels had risen as calorie intake remained the same . The study, published in the American Journal of Medicine, looked at the escalation of obesity in terms of both exercise and caloric intake. While the researchers did not examine what types of foods were consumed, they did observe total daily calorie, fat, carbohydrate, and protein consumption have not changed significantly over the period, yet the obesity rate among participants continued to rise. Researchers also tracked the rise in abdominal obesity, which is an independent indicator of mortality even among people with normal BMIs. This is defined by a waist circumference of at least 34.65sin (88cm) for women and 40.16ins (102cm) for men. The average increased by 0.37 per cent and 0.27 per cent respectively, per year. Just like the rise in average BMIs, the group most affected by increased rates of abdominal obesity was women. Prof Ladabaum said: 'The prevalence of abdominal obesity has increased among normal weight women and overweight women and men. 'It remains controversial whether overweight alone increases mortality risk, but the trends in abdominal obesity among the overweight are concerning in light of the risks associated with increased waist circumference independent of BMI.' While increased calorie intake is often blamed for rising rates of obesity, no association between the two factors was identified in the study. In contrast, an association was found between the trends over time for lack of physical activity and high BMI numbers. Prof Ladabaum said: 'Our findings do not support the popular notion the increase of obesity in the United States can be attributed primarily to sustained increase over time in the average daily caloric intake of Americans.' Identifying the link between the drop in physical activity and increased BMIs, as well as the groups particularly affected, can assist public health officials to develop targeted, effective interventions against the obesity epidemic. Journal editor Pamela Powers Hannley said: 'If we as a country truly want to take control of our health and our health care costs, the Ladabaum et al paper should be our clarion call. 'From encouraging communities to provide safe places for physical activity to ensuring ample supply of healthy food to empowering Americans to take control of their health, we must launch a concerted comprehensive effort to control obesity.'","Scientists found activity levels have fallen in 20 years as BMI has risen and calorie intake has remained the same .

"When Tony Pulis was out of work 12 months ago he travelled to the Crimean battlefields to indulge his love of history and took time to travel to America to see his new baby grandson. This time it will be different. Three days after leaving Crystal Palace all the 56-year-old wants is to return to management as soon as possible. He's proved that he has more variety in his coaching repertoire than the long throws for which his Stoke team were once notorious - and he wants to find another home to use his unique ability to build and develop a football club. Quick resolution: Former Palace boss Tony Pulis wants to get back in management as soon as possible . Pulis, named Premier League Manager of the Year by the LMA just three short months ago, is fiercely proud not only of how he saved Palace from an instant return to the Championship but of how he did it. He has asked the LMA to help him tie up the legal niceties of his exit from Selhurst Park as quickly as possible to allow him to move on. On Saturday night, a friend said: 'Tony is old school and loves football and wants to work again as soon as possible. 'After seven years at Stoke he was possibly ready for a break – this time he's hungry to remain in the game because he really enjoyed what he achieved at Palace and is disappointed he hasn't been able to kick on.' Pulis saw the fields where the Charge of the Light Brigade took place and made sure that he didn't lead Palace into impossible positions. But he walked out of Selhurst Park on Thursday feeling his job had become untenable as his relationship with chairman Steve Parish broke down. The two clashed over transfer policy and budgets, with Palace having spent just £2.5million so far this summer despite collecting more than £60million in TV income by staying in the top flight. He took over last November a club that had just four points, and not only finished 11th but did it by evolving an exciting style of play that made a nonsense of the long ball reputation that was a hangover from his early Stoke days. Broken relationship: Pulis failed to see eye-to-eye with Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish (right) Palace fans who were initially reluctant about his appointment loved the free flowing use of wingers and wanted more, except from better players and a stronger squad. The friend said: 'The idea which is being put around that the chairman didn't want to back Tony in the transfer market because he didn't like the style of play is frankly mystifying. 'When he took over he had to work with the squad he inherited and he organised them to play with pace and power and be really quick through the pitch. 'The result was some fantastically exciting games and some brilliant nights at Selhurst Park that got the ground absolutely buzzing. 'Nobody was complaining about the style of play when Palace beat Chelsea near the end of the season, or won 3-2 at Everton, or drew 3-3 with Liverpool. 'People were saying that was one of the most exciting games seen at Selhurst Park in years.' Pulis had planned to kick Palace forward during the summer, and believed he had convinced England centre half Steven Caulker to sign, only to find the club couldn't agree a deal. He wanted to strengthen the squad with other top players, but increasingly clashed with Parish and director of football Iain Moody about recruitment. Behind the scenes he has started work on plans to improve the club's training and medical facilities, just as he did at Stoke during seven years that dragged the club into the 21st Century. Temporary charge: Keith Millen has stepped in to take control of the Eagles following Pulis' sudden departure . But he believed that after working miracles to not just stay up but finish in 11th place – securing an extra £8million in merit money from the Premier League's TV rights distribution fund – he had earned the right to have a bigger say in where the club went next. Palace finished the season in a rich vein of form losing only one of their last eight games and scoring 14 goals in the process. And Pulis planned to serve up more entertainment while targeting a top half Premier League finish for the first time in the club's history. Instead he ended up unwilling to risk his proud record of never getting relegated in 22 years and 920 games as a manager if he didn't have the final say on the make-up of his squad. Pulis left Selhurst Park on Thursday feeling his job had become untenable as his relationship with chairman Steve Parish broke down over transfer policy and budgets. He took over last November when Palace had just four points and guided them to an 11th-placed finish playing exciting football that made a mockery of the long-ball reputation he earned from his early Stoke days. The friend added: 'The idea which is being put around that the chairman didn't want to back Tony in the transfer market because he didn't like the style of play is frankly mystifying. 'When he took over he had to work with the squad he inherited and he organised them to play with pace and power and be really quick through the pitch. 'The result was some fantastically exciting games and some brilliant nights at Selhurst Park that got the ground absolutely buzzing.'","The Welshman left Crystal Palace by mutual consent on Thursday .

"A Maine judge has ordered nurse Kaci Hickox to stay at least three feet from other people after she repeatedly defied the state's quarantine for medical workers who have treated Ebola patients. Miss Hickox, who tested negative for the deadly virus earlier this week, went against the mandatory guidelines by going cycling with her partner Ted Wilbur and having a pizza delivered to their home. But now, the 33-year-old has been temporarily ordered to remain a certain distance from others, avoid public places and stay in her hometown of Fort Kent in a bid to lessen the risk to the public. Charles LaVerdiere, chief judge of the Maine District Court, instructed the nurse to submit to 'direct active monitoring' and 'not to be present in public places', except to receive necessary healthcare. Scroll down for video . Court order: A Maine judge has ordered nurse Kaci Hickox (pictured receiving a takeaway pizza with her partner, Ted Wilbur) to stay at least three feet from others after she repeatedly defied the state's quarantine . Defying the rules: Miss Hickox, who tested negative for the deadly virus earlier this week, went against the mandatory guidelines by going on a bike ride with Mr Wilbur. Above, the nurse is pictured during the ride . Defying the rules: The 33-year-old (pictured, left, during the bike ride and, right, in her nurse's attire,) has been temporarily ordered by the Maine judge to remain at least three feet from others and avoid public places . However, she is permitted to engage in 'non-congregate public activities', such as walking or jogging in a park, providing she maintains a three-foot distance from other people. It comes less than 24 hours after the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, threatened to arrest Miss Hickox for defying her quarantine, saying: 'I don't want her within three feet of anyone.' The court order, which sees the state follow through with its threat to try to isolate the nurse for 21 days, Ebola's incubation period, was made on Thursday. It came in response to the state's request 'regarding the public health threat allegedly posed' by the nurse, said Judge LaVerdiere, but was issued only for 24 hours. Further action is due on Friday. It is believed that the three-foot distance from others is only applicable to  Miss Hickox's public presence; so her interaction with Mr Wilbur inside their home will not be affected. Miss Hickox, who was pictured beaming alongside Mr Wilbur as they received the pepperoni and mushroom pizza at their home on Thursday, maintains the quarantine violates her human rights. Home: Miss Hickox must also stay in her hometown of Fort Kent. Above, Mr Wilbur at the couple's house . Keeping watch: Reporters and photographers are seen watching Miss Hickox's property on Friday morning . Police at the house: The court order, which sees the state follow through with its threat to try to isolate the nurse for 21 days, Ebola's incubation period, was made on Thursday. However, it only lasts 24 hours . Threat: It comes less than 24 hours after the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage (pictured), threatened to arrest the nurse for defying the quarantine, saying: 'I don't want her within three feet of anyone' She claims that she has no symptoms and poses no risk to the public after returning from treating critically ill Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, West Africa, a week ago. As she returned home from the one-hour bike ride on Thu, the nurse said: 'There is no court action against me. There is nothing to stop me from going for a bike ride in my home town.' Police remained outside Miss Hickox's home on Friday, where they are closely monitoring the nurse's movements. Fort Kent Police Chief Tom Pelletier went inside the house briefly on Friday morning and said afterward: 'We just had a good conversation.' He said he was not there to arrest or detain her.

The legal action is shaping up as the nation's biggest test case yet in the struggle to balance public health and fear of Ebola against personal freedom. Miss Hickox stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey. After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine. She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease.

Interacting with the public: Miss Hickox speaks briefly with a reporter at her home (left) in Fort Kent, Maine, and beams as she receives the pepperoni and mushroom pizza (right) with Mr Wilbur on Thursday . 'I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based,' she said on Wednesday evening. Some states like Maine are going above and beyond the CDC guidelines to require quarantines. So is the U.S military. President Barack Obama, the nation's top infectious-disease expert and humanitarian groups have warned that overly restrictive measures could cripple the fight against the disease at its source. They claim such measures could discourage volunteers like Miss Hickox from going to West Africa, where the outbreak has sickened more than 13,000 people and killed nearly 5,000 of them. Giving interviews: Nurse Kaci Hickox (left) and her boyfriend Ted Wilbur speak to the media on Wednesday. MailOnline reporter Martin Gould (center) shook Miss Hickox's hand following the impromptu press conference . 'These kinds of restrictions could dissuade hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled volunteers from helping stop Ebola's spread, which is in the national interest of every one of our countries,' Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday in Brussels. U.S. public concern about Ebola is high, even though only one person in the country is currently being treated for it, a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who cared for patients in West Africa. Spencer, 33, was in serious but stable condition, New York's Bellevue Hospital said on Thursday.","Kaci Hickox, 33, flew to Sierra Leone, West Africa, to treat Ebola patients .

"Most of us are guilty of zoning out as the cabin crew point out the emergency exits before our flight takes off. So what’s the best way to grab our attention during the obligatory safety instructions? How about performing the splits in mid-air? One flight attendant made sure his enthusiastic demonstration on a recent Virgin America flight was impossible for passengers to ignore. Scroll down for video . Jive talking: The air steward demonstrates how to fasten the seat belt and operate the oxygen mask while gyrating his hips and shimmying up and down the aisles . Taking tips from the airline’s recent promotional film that uses dance routines and music to illustrate its pre-flight safety instructions, air steward Michael Tongko is seen running up and down the aisle and gyrating his hips to music.

But Mr Tongko perseveres, demonstrating how . to fasten the seat belt and operate the oxygen mask while shimmying back . and forth, waving his arms in the air. Runway hit: The flight attendant makes sure he gets everyone's attention with a series of dramatic moves, including a high kick to the cabin ceiling and mid-air splits . He then grabs a life jacket and dramatically drops to the floor to laughter in the cabin. Clearly enjoying himself, he proceeds to point out the exits, striding up and down the cabin as if auditioning for a part in a Broadway musical. He dramatically rounds off this . segment of the demonstration with a high kick to the cabin ceiling to . cries of ‘Nice!’ from the passengers. Grinning . widely, he runs back down the cabin, arms outstretched, before . returning to first class to perform his impressive finale - the splits . in mid-air - to whoops and applause from the passengers. The routine was captured by passenger Zac Bowling from San Francisco who filmed Mr Tongko's exhausting dance moves on a flight from Las . Vegas to San Francisco . A video of Michael . performing a similar routine was also filmed on a flight from San Francisco to Seattle. He has clearly been putting his hobby to good use - the air steward is a figure skater in his spare time.

The flight attendant’s snazzy moves mimic the airline’s recent promotional video in which dancers and former American Idol contestants sing, rap and dance along to the safety instructions.

"He's always liked younger ladies (think Penelope Cruz, 40, and Katie Holmes, 35), but this new one appears to be fresh out of college. On Friday UsWeekly reported Tom Cruise, 52, has a 'crush' on Emily, his 22-year-old assistant who's helping him while he shoots Mission: Impossible 5 around the world. In late September the actor was spotted with a mystery woman who appears to be the lady in question. They were side-by-side as he took a break from filming in London. Scroll down for video . A new romance?: Tom Cruise  is 'crushing' on a 22-year-old Mission: Impossible 5 female crew member, according to a Friday report from UsWeekly; in September the 52-year-old actor was spotted with this lovely woman on the London set of the sequel . She looks like a college student: The woman that Cruise was seen with in England wore a grey sweatshirt and a braided bracelet; interestingly, Tom had one on too . 'He's always flirting with her,' a source revealed. 'Most people on the film have noticed how into her he is.' Ever the professional, the father of three is waiting until his work on the big-budget action movie is over till he takes the lady out. 'He's already asked Emily to go out to dinner with him, on a date, when they're done shooting,' the source said. Mr On The Go: Cruise looked like he had his hands full with two cell phones and headphones on as the young lady greeted him; she too was wired up with a Walkie Talkie at the ready . Hot catch: The A lister has been single since divorcing Katie Holmes in 2012; together they have daughter Suri, aged eight . And the Oscar nominee is very excited about when that day comes. The insider has 'never seen him crush on anyone so hard.' Tom has two children with Nicole Kidman who are around the same age as the assistant: 19-year-old Connor (who is working as a DJ in nightclubs) and 21-year-old Isabella. The woman pictured with Cruise in September seems to be just his type: attractive with long hair and thick eyebrows. Not an easy film to make: The Oscar nominee has been doing many of his own stunts on the fifth installment of Mission: Impossible; here he was shooting a scene on an airplane on Monday in England . She could even pass for a relative of Holmes', who Cruise was married to from 2006 to 2012 and had daughter Suri, aged eight, with. Tom has not dated anyone since he split from Katie in the summer of 2012. But it was only last week that the Top Gun star was linked to both Miranda Kerr and Lindsay Lohan in separate reports. Both beauties denied they had romantic relations with the thrice-married A-lister (his first marriage was to 58-year-old actress Mimi Rogers). Another beauty on set: The Minority Report hit maker is also working with newcomer Stella Stocker on Mission: Impossible 5, which is due out in December 2015 . A flat-out hit: Tom in 1996 in the first Mission: Impossible movie, which has spawned three sequels . This new report comes from a source who is working on the set of the action film. Tom has been shooting M:I5 in England, Austria and Morocco. Mission: Impossible 5 is an action-spy film directed by Christopher McQuarrie, and written by Drew Pearce and Will Staples. It is the fifth film in the highly successful Mission: Impossible series. Will he marry for a fourth time?: The Edge Of Tomorrow superstar, seen here in May, is worth a fortune and still has a lot of power in Hollywood so the ladies must be flocking . Along with Tom as agent Ethan Hunt, Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton are also returning. Alec Baldwin is a fresh face in the cast. Newcomer Stella Stocker (who had a small part in Brad Pitt's Fury), also has a role. Interestingly, she resembles Katie as well. Filming began on M;I5 in August, 2014 and is scheduled to be released in North America by Paramount Pictures on December 25, 2015.

"Legia Warsaw have confirmed they have submitted an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over their expulsion from the Champions League. The Polish side were punished by UEFA for fielding an ineligible player in their 6-1 aggregate win over Celtic in the third qualifying round of European football's elite club competition. Legia appealed UEFA's decision to award Celtic a 3-0 third qualifying round second-leg win which saw the Scottish champions progress to the play-offs on away goals, but on Thursday the organisation's appeals body upheld the decision, prompting Legia to ask CAS to intervene. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Jagiellona taunt Legia Warsaw before Polish league game . Ineligible: Bereszynski (left) celebrates qualification but he shouldn't have been on the pitch against Celtic . Appeal: Dariusz Mioduski, the Legia Warsaw owner, has announced that the club will appeal to CAS . To add insult to injury the Polish side were mocked in their domestic league game against Jagiellonia, with the home side playing the Champions League theme song before kick-off. Jagiellonia's fans then proceeded to chant 'Glasgow Celtic' in an attempt to anger their opponents. However Henning Berg's side had the last laugh, winning 3-0. Legia failed to submit the prompt appeal to CAS they had promised, but the club confirmed late on Friday night they had indeed sought arbitration from the Switzerland-based organisation. A statement on Legia's website said: 'Legia Warsaw announces that today an appeal has been submitted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne (CAS) against the decision of the UEFA Appeals Committee of 13 August 2014.' Second chance: Celtic have been reinstated into the competition, and are due to face Maribor this week . Outclassed: Legia put six goals past Celtic before UEFA ruled they should be punished last week . CAS confirmed it had received Legia's appeal, saying: 'The Court of Arbitration for Sport registered today at 17:30 a statement of appeal filed by the Polish club Legia Warsaw against the decision of the UEFA appeals body confirming the result 3-0 (forfeit) in favour of Celtic FC against Legia in the second leg of the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. 'The UEFA considered that Legia had fielded an ineligible player (Bartosz Bereszynski) during the match. 'Legia requests urgent provisional measures from CAS allowing the Polish club to participate in the play-offs of the Champions League (20 & 26 August 2014). 'More generally, the club requests that the UEFA decision be set aside and that all sanctions against the club and the player Bereszynski be annulled. 'The CAS has immediately initiated an arbitration procedure and the respondents UEFA and Celtic FC have been invited to file written observations. A decision on request for provisional measures is likely to be issued on Monday 18 August around 18:00 (Swiss time).' Hopeful: Legia boss Henning Berg believes his side could be given another shot at the Champions League . The punishment, which turned a 6-1 aggregate win for Legia into an away-goals defeat, stemmed from Legia's failure to register Bereszynski in their squad list for the second qualifying round against St Patrick's. That meant his three-match suspension had not officially been served when he came on as an 86th-minute substitute as Legia beat Celtic 2-0 at Murrayfield. As things stand, Celtic are due to play Slovenian side Maribor for a place in the Champions League group stages next Wednesday, while Legia will face Kazakhstan side Aktobe in a Europa League qualifier the following day.","Henning Berg's side have submitted appeal to Court of Arbitration for Sport .

"These extraordinary photographs provide a unique on-the-ground view of the immediate aftermath of the 1944 D-Day invasion. The campaign heralded the beginning of the end of the Second World War, as 160,000 Allied soldiers landed on the beaches of France to liberate it from the occupying Nazi forces. The iconic operation - the largest sea invasion in history - has been chronicled in numerous films, books and TV series, but as these images show, there is still an enormous amount of previously unseen material captured by the troops who took part in the heroic mission.

The two boys are watching an American Jeep drive past the rubble-strewn landscape . Intriguingly, they record the often-overlooked contribution of women to the success of the operation. The photos show the nurses who arrived after the initial landings to treat wounded soldiers in field hospitals. The conditions would have been harrowing - an estimated 12,000 Allied troops died in the fighting.

"Under fire: Author John Grisham sparked international outrage this week for saying men who watch child porn are sentenced too harshly while defending a Mississippi friend caught on serious charges . When John Grisham sparked outrage around the world by saying that men who view child pornography were being unfairly treated, the best-selling author had the case of a ‘law school buddy’ in mind. He described a man who, under the influence of heavy drinking, had downloaded pictures from a website labeled ’16-year-old wannabe hookers or something’. Caught in a police sting, he was jailed for three years, said Grisham. ‘We’ve gone nuts with this incarceration’, intoned the master of courtroom thrillers. Unfortunately for Grisham, however, the man on whom he reportedly based his controversial argument insists the author was completely wrong. Michael Holleman, whose application to be reinstated as a lawyer was backed by Grisham after he was disbarred for downloading child pornography from the internet, told the Daily Mail he fully deserved the 18 months he received in prison. ‘I did something wrong and I don’t have a bit of resentment about the way I was treated,’ said Holleman, formerly one of Mississippi’s top criminal lawyers. ‘It’s illegal and should be punished. If it’s a crime, it’s a crime. There’s a violation of the right of privacy involved. There’s people now who, because of the internet, who are making child pornography so they can share it across the internet. There are good reasons for it to be illegal and punished.’ He added: ‘They were just images that I looked at and deleted. It consumed about five minutes of my life and it was a terrible mistake. I spend my days now helping other people.’ Grisham has not confirmed widespread reports that he was referring to 59-year-old Holleman but the similarities with his case are glaring. Like the ‘buddy’ outlined by Grisham to illustrate his point, Holleman became a heavy drinker who downloaded child pornography only to be arrested and jailed following a ‘sting’ operation set up by Canadian police. Holleman, from Gulfport, Mississippi, said Grisham had contacted him after his remarks provoked anger to assure him he had been referring to someone else. Holleman, who is back practicing as a personal injury lawyer but no longer works for his prestigious family practice, admitted he had ‘paid a heavy price’ for breaking the law but had ‘moved on’. He was released from prison in 1999 after serving 15 months of his sentence but the scandal ended his marriage. Online reaction: Many commented that Grisham's claims don't take into account the victims of sexual abuse involved with child pornography . He said he was now ‘happily remarried’ with a son at university. ‘I decided to pick myself up, make the best of my life and be a better husband and better father, a better person and help other people,’ he said. Grisham, the author of bestsellers such as The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client, was forced to apologise for his remarks in a newspaper interview. Outrage: Fans quickly reacted to the controversial comments made by John Grisham, who is currently promoting his latest book, legal thriller Gray Mountain, which will be released next week . Author John Grisham, wife Renee Grisham and family attend the Broadway opening night of A Time To Kill at The Golden Theatre on October 20, 2013 in New York City . He insisted his comments ‘were in no way intended to show sympathy for those conviced of sex crimes, especially the sexual molestation of children.’ But compounding Grisham’s embarrassment, it emerges that he grossly understated the extent of his friend’s offences. Far from merely looking at pictures of 16-year-olds – which wouldn’t anyway be illegal under Mississippi law - Holleman was accused of accessing sexually explicit images of children who in some cases were younger than 12. Not only did he download them but he also sent some 13 images to an undercover police officer in Canada, resulting in a conviction for ‘sending and receiving’ child pornography. Despite the seriousness of his crimes, Holleman agrees with Grisham on one point, he said. He doesn’t believe that anyone who looks at child pornography is automatically a paedophile and insisted he wasn’t one himself. ‘There’s no doctor in the world who would say because someone looks at something on the internet, that makes them a paedophile. ‘The pictures [he looked at] were disgusting – it’s like looking at the pictures of a horrible murder scene, which I’ve also done. But it doesn’t make you a murderer,’ he said. ‘But they were grotesque to me and I understand why it’s illegal and should be.’","Novelist and lawyer John Grisham, 59, sparked outrage this week by claiming men are wrongly sent to prison for watching child porn .

According to FlashNord, the city legislator from St Petersburg said: 'what could he [Cook] bring us? The Ebola virus, Aids, gonorrhea? They all have unseemly ties over there. Ban him for life.' Scroll down for video . Russian Anti LGBT campaigner Vitaly Milonov (right) has suggested Apple CEO Tim Cook (left) could bring 'the Ebola virus, Aids or gonorrhea', and should be banned from the country for life . Mr Cook, pictured at gay pride on June 29, said his sexuality has been 'tough and uncomfortable' at times . Mr Cook made the announcement on Thursday, declaring his sexual orientation is one of the 'greatest gifts God has given me'. The 53-year-old, said he had been open with many people about his sexuality for years but wanted to maintain a level of privacy in the public sphere. However, in a first-person article for BloombergBusinessweek, he said he hopes coming out will inspire people to insist on their right to equality - and that is 'worth the trade-off with my own privacy'. The declaration makes Mr Cook the highest-profile business CEO to have come out as being gay. Writing in Businessweek Mr Cook wrote: 'Let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me. 'Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day. 'It's made me more empathetic, which has led to a richer life.' Mr Cook, pictured at Pride on June 29, said coming out wasn't 'an easy choice' because he guarded his privacy but 'if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy' He added: 'If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy.' Part of social progress, Mr Cook explained, is understanding that a person is not defined by singular characteristics like their sexuality, and urged readers to remember that he is also engineer, an uncle, a nature lover, a fitness nut, a son of the South, a sports fanatic, and many other things. But he conceded that he is part of a minority that could greatly benefit from his support. Throughout the 800-word essay, Mr Cook describes a 'tough and uncomfortable' existence at times from his 'humble roots' in Alabama to global success in Silicon Valley. America, he said, 'has changed so much since I was a kid' and is moving towards equality, something helped by brave public figures that had come out and changed public perceptions. A tweet from Mr Cook on June 29 congratulating his thousands of employees who part in the gay pride parade . Nonetheless, with laws still in place across the U.S. that make sexuality a sack-able offense, he said being gay has given him a 'deeper understanding' of what it means to be a minority. It had also made him more confident in his own identity, helped him 'rise above adversity and bigotry' and to develop the 'skin of a rhinoceros' that it takes to run a company like Apple. The motivation to write this article was inspired by the pictures on his office wall of Robert F Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who said: 'Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'' While not considering himself an 'activist', Mr Cook said he realizes how much he had benefited from the 'sacrifice of others' so knew he needed to speak out. He said Apple had long advocated for human rights and equality. For example, he lists Apple's support of a workplace equality bill before Congress, and of marriage equality in California. In February, the company issued a public appeal to the state of Arizona urging them to abandon an anti-gay bill that would permit discrimination on religious grounds. The company, he said, holds up Dr King and Kennedy as icons for that ideal. Mr Cook wrote: 'I don't pretend that writing this puts me in their league. 'All it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that I'm doing my part, however small, to help others. 'We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.' In June, shortly before Mr Cook attended San Francisco's 44th annual Gay Pride Parade, he was accidentally outed on a CNBC current affairs show live on-air. Mr Cook was outed live on air during CNBC's Friday night edition of Squawk in June by Simon Hobbs . After Mr Hobbs made the remark the studio went silent as he tried and failed to recover from the comment . Simon Hobbs was one of several co-hosts when New York Times columnist Jim Stewart appeared on CNBC's Friday edition of Squawk on the Street to talk about an article he'd written that explores the dearth of openly gay CEOs. Speaking about how former CEO of BP Lord Browne became the first person at a Fortune 500 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay, Mr Stewart said there's a 'corporate culture that prevents powerful gay men from going public.' He said: 'You'd think CEOs especially are measured by objective criteria, financial performance. Mr Stewart then went on to say that he had contacted a number of CEOs for a comment for his story and received a 'very cool reception'. Then co-host Mr Hobbs piped up, saying, 'I think Tim Cook is fairly open about the fact he's gay at the head of Apple, isn't he?' For a moment, a deafening silence filled the studio as the hosts looked awkwardly from one to the other before Mr Stewart, shaking his head in disapproval, responds with a succinct, 'No.' Hobbs tried to recover, 'Oh, dear, was that an error? I thought he was open about it.' Tim Cook was born in Alabama and attended Auburn University. After graduating he spent 12 years at IBM, rising to become director of North American Fulfillment. He then served as Chief Operating Officer of the computer re-seller division of Intelligent Electronics and was Vice President for Corporate Materials at Compaq for six months. Mr Cook joined Apple in 1998 - two years after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Despite being advised to stay with Compaq, Mr Cook said he wanted to join Apple within five minutes of meeting Steve Jobs. Mr Cook later said the offer was a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to work with a 'creative genius'. Mr Cook's first job was as Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations. He also worked as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Operations and was Chief Operating Officer until he was named the CEO on August 24, 2011, when he succeeded Mr Jobs . Since taking over as CEO, Mr Cook has overseen the introduction and launch of five new iPhones, including the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as 7 new iPads, including the iPad mini. The company will also introduce its first smartwatch in early 2015; The Apple Watch. Under Mr Cook, Apple also purchased Beats Audio, the headphones and music firm owned by rapper Dr Dre, in a multi-billion dollar deal concluded earlier this year. According to the Interbrand Best Global Brands report, Apple is currently the world's most valuable brand, with a valuation of $118.9 billion. Earlier this month the firm announced record iPhone sales as part of their quarterly results. The record-breaking launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - with 10 million units sold in the first weekend, meant the technology giant reported net profit of $8.5 billion for the final quarter of 2014. Up to the time of the announcement, 40 million iPhones had been sold in Q4. Since then, the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 have also gone on sale. Mr Cook also serves on the board of directors of Nike, Inc.and the National Football Foundation.","Anti LGBT campaigner Vitaly Milonov said Mr Cook should be banned .

"Mistakes by NHS staff are  to blame for the death or significant harm of 250 patients a day, figures show. In just six months there were 45,476 errors with such serious consequences, including incorrect diagnosis and patients given the wrong treatment or drug. Of these, 1,958 led to death and 43,518 resulted in significant harm. NHS hospitals have been told to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided. These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis and surgery in the wrong area. When near misses are also taken into account, the data from NHS England shows there was a total of 725,314 safety incidents between April and September 2013, though the majority were very minor. The figure is nine per cent higher than the previous six months. Officials said this is because staff are being more honest – not that care has got worse. But campaigners said the findings were probably an underestimate as many trusts still do not own up to every mistake. Since 2010 all NHS hospitals have been obliged to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided. These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis, surgery in the wrong area or treatment being given too slowly. But in the past some staff have not owned up to such mistakes for fear of legal action by patients or relatives. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans in March for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years . Peter Walsh, of charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said: ‘These figures are a timely reminder that there is an awful long way to go. ‘It is surprising how much error actually happens. 'Most experts believe that there is still very significant under-reporting so the real figures are probably worse.’ He said that studies had estimated that as many as one in ten patients admitted to hospital were involved in a patient safety incident, although this included other Western countries. ‘We need to get the culture right and have a regulation system that’s fit for purpose,’ he said. In March health secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years. They include closer monitoring of hospitals as well the recruitment of extra staff specifically tasked with cutting down on harm. Dr Mike Durkin, NHS England’s director of patient safety, said it was ‘hugely encouraging’ that more incidents were being reported as it showed staff were ‘increasingly comfortable with speaking openly about mistakes and learning from error’.","45,000 NHS errors with serious consequences recorded in six months .

"author] . Prescription errors: 47 per cent of deaths involved GPs not providing sufficiently powerful medicine . Up to 800 asthma patients die needlessly every year because doctors prescribe the wrong medication or fail to monitor  them properly. Prescription errors are a factor in nearly half of the deaths, according to a study by doctors. Other patients have not been offered check-ups or advice on how to avoid attacks. Around 1,250 Britons die from asthma every year. The mortality rate is the third highest in Europe, behind only Estonia and Spain. And the latest figures show that the numbers have been steadily rising since 2009 when there were  1,140 deaths. In the largest study of its kind, the Royal College of Physicians closely examined the deaths of 195 Britons from asthma in 2012 and 2013, including 28 children. They found prescription errors  had occurred in 47 per cent of cases, with GPs giving patients only short-term relieving inhalers rather than preventative medication that stops them having an attack. A further 10 per cent had been treated in hospital for asthma a month before they died but had been discharged without the correct medication and not been properly monitored since. More than a fifth had gone to A&E suffering an asthma attack at least once in the year before they died, including 11 per cent who had been admitted twice or more. Care was particularly poor for children. The report concluded that in 26 out of the 28 child deaths there were ‘potentially avoidable factors’. Overall, it found that 130 of the 195  deaths - 67 per cent - could have been prevented. The authors say these figures are consistent with previous, smaller studies into avoidable asthma deaths. If this is true across the UK, then around 800 of the 1,250 deaths which occurred in 2012 could have been prevented. Kay Boycott, chief executive of the charity Asthma UK, said the research ‘has identified prescribing errors of a frankly horrifying scale and is a damning indictment of current routine practice’. She added: ‘In many of these cases the warning signs were ignored.’ Dr Kevin Stewart, clinical director at the RCP, said: ‘It’s time to end our complacency about asthma, which can, and does, kill. At risk: The study found that almost every child death involved preventable factors . ‘We haven’t paid enough attention to the importance of good routine asthma care by clinicians with the right training and experience and the part that patients themselves play in this.’ One of the main problems is that GPs were found to be prescribing too many ‘reliever’ inhalers – to be used during an asthma attack – instead of preventive ones which control the symptoms over the long term. Dr Mark Levy from the RCP – who is also a practising GP – said this may be partly due to cost pressures. The report found 39 per cent of patients had needed to be prescribed 12 or more reliever inhalers in a single year. This should have been a ‘clear warning signal’ to their GP that their asthma was out of control. Professor Chris Griffiths of Queen Mary University of London, who contributed to the research, said: ‘This report shows how care has deteriorated since the last national analysis of asthma deaths in 2005. ‘These worrying statistics can and must be turned around in the next decade.’ About 5.4million Britons have been diagnosed with asthma, including 1.1million children.","1,250 people in Britain die from asthma a year - a figure which is increasing .

"You can say one thing for Prince Andrew – he certainly has a type. For the second time in a matter of months, the prince has been seen in public with a stunning brunette lingerie model almost half his age. This week at Royal Ascot he entertained Dara Tomanovich – a Canadian who has modelled lingerie for Marks and Spencer – in the Royal Box. Scroll down for video . Royal Box: Model Dara Tomanovich chats with Princes Andrew and Harry at Ascot on Wednesday . And Miss Tomanovich – who was pictured talking to the Duke of York, 54, and his nephew Prince Harry on Wednesday – was back at the race meeting again yesterday, still sporting her coveted Royal Box and Royal Household badges. It comes after Andrew was linked in February to another underwear model, Monika Jakisic, 34 – nicknamed ‘the Croatian Sensation’ – who had previously dated George Clooney. Legwork: Model Miss Tomanovich has appeared for Marks & Spencer . When Miss Jakisic tweeted a picture of a diamond ring shortly after the pair  were seen dining together, Buckingham Palace aides were forced to issue an unprecedented statement denying the two were engaged. Last night Miss Tomanovich, who is signed to one of the most prestigious model agencies in New York, Wilhelmina, remained tight-lipped about whether she was romancing the single prince. ‘We do not comment on Dara’s personal life,’ said an agency spokesman. Miss Tomanovich has been a successful model since the age of 18, having been  the ‘face’ of designer Chloe, appeared  in Vogue and having also been photographed by the legendary fashion cameraman Patrick Demarchelier. Her agency’s website describes her as being 5ft 9in, having a 26in waist and a 34B bust with hazel eyes and brown hair. Coincidentally, she appeared alongside Clooney in an advert for Fiat cars and says on her Twitter feed that she rides a Ducati motorbike. Buckingham Palace declined to comment last night. It is understood that all of the guests who are in the Royal Box are given Royal Household badges to wear as an additional form of identification. A source said Prince Andrew – who divorced Sarah, Duchess of York in 1996 – had invited a number of guests to join him at the race meeting during the week.

"A leading member of the Ferguson protest movement has made an impassioned plea to the Grand Jury deciding whether to indict the white officer who shot dead a black teenager. Larry Fellows III said that his message to the panel is: 'A mother has lost her son and it is not of his own doing. 'For people to continually to say it's his fault for his death is just disgusting. 'You have in your hands the decision to put someone away who has murdered a young man.' In an interview with MailOnline, Fellows also revealed that the protesters feared that the police response to unrest when the Grand Jury make their decision could be '10 times worse' than before - because they had been preparing for so long. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Warning: Larry Fellows III revealed that the protestors feared that the police response to unrest when the Grand Jury make their decision could be '10 times worse' than before . Tensions: Michael Brown (left) was shot dead in August by officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri, sparking massive protests over the death. A grand jury is deciding whether to indict him . Fellows, 29, has become a leading voice in the protest movement and has built up 5,000 followers on his Twitter account  through his work with the organizers. They began work right after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, 28, a white police officer with the force in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis in Missouri, on August 9. The killing sparked several nights of violent protest which was met with a military style response that sparked a debate about the use of force by police and race relations in America. Since then protesters have been working under coalitions such as Hands Up United and in October staged a 'Weekend of Resistance'. They have also made extensive use of social media, appeared on major TV networks, set up training sessions for protesters and have won pledges of support from around the world. With the Grand Jury decision expected in the coming days, Missouri governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in St Louis and the surrounding counties with 400 troops expected to be deployed in the downtown area of the city. Fellows said: 'With governor Nixon declaring a state of emergency for St Louis that's basically just the unwritten rule that whatever the police feel, if they feel threatened or feel the need to act in a certain way, they have the freedom to do so. 'So it's no-holds barred on our constitutional rules and our rights as citizens. That's out the door for now. 'Going into that mentally, we can prepare as much as we think we can but what are we preparing for? With us going through August, we think it's going to be 10 times worse. It's so hilarious for me how people focus and violence and it's coming from police, not protesters.' Fellows told MailOnline that an indictment was the 'only way' the Grand Jury, which has nine white members and three black, should vote. He said: 'They have that power to decide should he be reprimanded...It's not fair' Flashpoint: Ferguson is expecting more demonstrations when the grand jury ends it deliberations . Tensions: Demonstrations are already taking place in Ferguson, Missouri, with calls for Darren Wilson to be indicted by the grand jury, which meets again on Friday, over the killing of Michael Brown . Divide: Although most demonstrations have been pro-Michael Brown some, such as this woman's protest, have been in support of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown to death . Fellows said that he has heard many rumors about Wilson: that he went to a St Louis Blues ice hockey game, that he had dyed his hair and that he had changed his name. Some people were even joking that he was in Sri Lanka or the Bahamas. Fellows said: 'I think he's in St Louis. Look how much money people have raised for him. He doesn't have to leave. 'Nobody's protected Mike's (Brown) family. I couldn't be in the same room as him (Wilson). I'm not even an angry person or a violent person. I can't sit and look at you in the face. 'If you are a human being, you have a heart and you have any common sense, turn yourself in. 'Why are you letting it go on like this? I have no respect for him. It's as simple as that. Go to the Feds and turn yourself in' It has now been three months since Brown was shot dead and the protesters are 'exhausted', Fellows said. He had been working as a biller for a healthcare company but lost his job as he found it impossible to juggle employment and protesting. Fellows said that he cannot pay his bills and that the rent on his apartment was overdue - and others like him are in the same boat. He said: 'It's definitely a huge sacrifice. I have a lot of friends who have kids and they can't come out (and protest) for that very reason. 'That's why I'm doing this, so that their kids can walk out on the street and not be approached by a cop asking them where they're going. 'That's why I'm doing this.' Fellows told MailOnline that he was 'skeptical' about the Ferguson Commission which was announced on Tuesday by Missouri governor Jay Nixon to look into the causes of the divisions in the city. However he said had 'absolute faith' in four members who he knew personally, including the youngest, 20-year-old Rasheen Lamont Aldridge. EXCLUSIVE: Pro-Darren Wilson demonstrators face claims of KKK infiltration after 'imperial wizard' apparently spotted by anti-police demonstrators . Laura Collins In Ferguson, Missouri for MailOnline . Klu Klux Klan members may have infiltrated groups supporting Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, it can be disclosed. Supporters for Darren Wilson have removed a photograph from their Facebook page in which activist group Anonymous claim to identify three members of the Ku Klux Klan. Anonymous seized two of the Ku Klux Klan's twitter accounts yesterday after the Klan distributed fliers threatening the use of 'lethal force' should violence erupt in the wake of Ferguson Grand Jury's decision on whether to indict Wilson. Now, as part of Anon Cop Watch, the group has circulated numerous photographs 'unhooding' Klan members. Among them is one showing 13 members of the St Louis Klan. It is set shown alongside an image of a rally held in support of Darren Wilson rally in which, they claim, three Klan members feature prominently. One of them appears to be Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Missouri and the man behind the recent fliers. Accusation: How activist group anonymous identified what it says are three KKK members (left in robes) at a pro-Darren Wilson protest (right). There is no suggestion than any KKK presence was known to organisers . Out in the open: The full picture of the KKK group posted by the Anonymous group. It is just the latest escalation of the racial tensions that were ignited this summer when officer Wilson shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18. Protesters adopted the slogan 'Hands Up Don't Shoot' - a reference to witness accounts claiming that Brown had his hands up when Wilson let off his fatal volley on August 9. Less than two minutes elapsed between Wilson, 28, stopping Brown and friend, Dorian Johnson, as they walked down the middle of Canfield Road which snakes down from the main drag of West Florissant, and shooting Brown dead. In the three months since that day Ferguson has been riven by violence, protest, gunfire and looting. Brown's own parents have consistently distanced themselves from the violence that saw protesters and police clash as battle lines were drawn near the scene of the shooting across night after night of riots. But, with the Ferguson Grand Jury expected to deliver its verdict on whether or not to indict Wilson on a murder charge this week, the FBI have described violent civil unrest as 'inevitable.' Governor Jay Nixon's decision to declare a State of Emergency and activated the National Guard on Monday was seen by many as confirmation that a decision from the Grand Jury is imminent. And prosecutor Bob McCulloch has always maintained that a verdict would be reached by mid to late November. But leaks reported by the St Louis Dispatch, which suggest that the officer will not be indicted, have only heightened the likelihood of violent reprisal. As MailOnline reported, 'militant resistance group' the Black Rebels has boasted of being 'war ready,' and stockpiling high caliber ammunition. While the Ku Klux Klan leaflets distributed in Ferguson and the surrounding towns suggest a similar readiness for violence.","Larry Fellows III says panel has duty towards Michael Brown's family to charge officer with first-degree murder .

"A new species of shrimp has been discovered living deeper than any seen before in the world's most extreme deep sea volcanic vents. British scientists made the discovery while on an expedition to explore boiling undersea springs - which may be hotter than 450C - on the Caribbean seafloor. Some 5,000 metres down, in a rift in the seafloor, exists a volcanic spring known as a 'black smoker', which fires a jet of mineral-laden water more than a kilometre into the ocean above. No little discovery: Rimicaris hybisae, the world's deepest known vent shrimp, was found at a depth of 5,000 metres . Hot stuff: Thousands of the newly discovered species of shrimp mass around an oceanic geyser beneath the Cayman Islands, in temperatres in excess of 450C . But despite the extreme conditions, the vents are teeming with thousands of a new species of shrimp that has a light-sensing organ on its back. The pale shrimp congregate in hordes - up to 2,000 shrimp per square metre - around the six-metre tall mineral spires of the vents. Lacking normal eyes, the shrimp instead have a light-sensing organ on their backs, which may help them to navigate in the faint glow of deep-sea vents. The researchers have named the shrimp Rimicaris hybisae, after the deep-sea vehicle that they used to collect them.

The Cayman shrimp is related to a species called Rimicaris exoculata, found at other deep-sea vents 4,000 kilometres away on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The team was led by marine geochemist Dr Doug Connelly, of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, and marine biologist Dr Jon Copley, of the University of Southampton. During an expedition in April 2010 the scientists used a robot submarine to locate and study the vents at a depth of five kilometres in the Cayman Trough, an undersea trench south of the Cayman Islands. The vents are gushing hot fluids that are unusually rich in copper, and shooting a jet of mineral-laden water four times higher into the ocean above than other deep-sea vents. Although the scientists were not able to measure the temperature of the vents directly, these two features indicate that the world's deepest known vents may be hotter than 450C, according to the researchers. Elsewhere at the Beebe Vent Field, the team saw hundreds of white-tentacled anemones lining cracks where warm water seeps from the sea bed. Dr Copley said: 'Studying the creatures at these vents, and comparing them with species at other vents around the world will help us to understand how animals disperse and evolve in the deep ocean.' The researchers also found black smoker vents on the upper slopes of an undersea mountain called Mount Dent which rises nearly three kilometres above the seafloor of the Cayman Trough, but its peak is still more than three kilometres beneath the waves. Dr Connelly said: 'Finding black smoker vents on Mount Dent was a complete surprise. 'Hot . and acidic vents have never been seen in an area like this before, and . usually we don't even look for vents in places like this.' A light in the dark: The vents of Mount Dent are also home to snake-like fish and previously unseen species of snail and a flea-like crustacean called an amphipods . He said: 'Because undersea mountains like Mount Dent may be quite common in the oceans, the discovery suggests that deep-sea vents might be more widespread around the world than previously thought.' The vents on Mount Dent are also thronged with the new species of shrimp, along with snake-like fish, and previously unseen species of snail and a flea-like crustacean called an amphipod. Dr Copley said: 'One of the big mysteries of deep-sea vents is how animals are able to disperse from vent field to vent field, crossing the apparently large distances between them. 'But maybe there are more ""stepping stones"" like these out there than we realised.' The British expedition that revealed the vents followed a U.S. expedition in November 2009, which detected the plumes of water from deep-sea vents in the Cayman Trough. A second U.S. expedition is currently using a remotely-operated deep-diving vehicle to investigate the vents further and the British team also plans to return to the Cayman Trough in 2013 with Isis, the National Oceanography Centre's deep-diving remotely operated vehicle, which can work at depths of up to 6,000 metres. The findings were published in the scientific journal Nature Communications.","Rimicaris hybisae was found 5,000m beneath the Caribbean sea ."
"A committee of MPs is under fire after claiming cuts in Britain's spending on international aid could have contributed to the spread of the Ebola virus. Ministers were accused by the international development committee of undermining £20 million of previous UK-funded work in Liberia by failing to help prevent the government there holding back EU-channelled aid from the health sector. But government sources dismissed the idea Britain was to blame for the spread of the deadly disease as 'factually wrong'. Scroll down for video . Health workers tackle the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, with figures showing more than 3,000 people in west Africa have been killed . Experts have warned that the outbreak in West Africa has developed at an unprecedented scale with the current rate of infection standing at 1.7, meaning that for every 10 people that contract the virus a further 17 will be infected. A summit on how to tackle the spread of the virus is being held in London today. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Development Secretary Justine Greening and Ernest Bai Koroma, the president of Sierra Leone, are among those taking part in the global event at Lancaster House in central London. The UK Government has promised a further £20 million aid to pay for vital medical supplies including chlorine, personal protection equipment such as masks, protection suits and gloves, and essential water and sanitation facilities. It will also be used to deploy clinicians, global health experts, epidemiologists and infection control advisers from Public Health England, King's Health Partners and the United Nations. But the Commons international development committee said that while that was a welcome move, far wider action was needed to reverse a failure to prioritise Sierra Leone and Liberia. In a scathing report, the parliamentary watchdog said the crisis 'demonstrates the dangers of ignoring the least developed countries in the world', accusing ministers and aid agencies of switching focus to 'higher-profile' places. International development secretary Justine Greening insisted the government was acting to help countries affected by the outbreak . The MPs accused the Department for International Development (DfID) and the European Union of doing nothing to deal with the fact that tens of billions of pounds of EU-led health aid was not being passed on by Liberia's finance ministry. 'There is an alarming lack of capacity in the health system, including a shortage of skilled clinicians,' the MPs said, noting that 10 per cent of Sierra Leone's domestically trained nurses are working in the UK health system. The committee said it was 'shocked' to discover that only 3.9 million US dollars (£2.4 million) of 60 million dollars (£37 million) EU health sector support was passed on by Liberia's ministry of finance to the ministry of health over a two-year period. 'Neither the EU nor DfID seemed to be doing anything to resolve the situation. DfID has been working for the last five years on building up the Liberian health system and have spent £20 million doing so. 'Ministers should be concerned that this work is being undone, not least because DfID provides 16 per cent of its total budget to the EU (£1.23 billion).' But Miss Greening insisted said Britain was 'working urgently with Sierra Leone to scale up the international response to the disease'. 'Last month, Britain pledged to support 700 treatment beds in Sierra Leone, but keeping basic public health services running is vital to halt the spread of the disease. 'Our latest support will allow stretched medical staff and aid agencies to prevent further infection.' A government source added: 'It is just factually wrong to claim that an Ebola outbreak could have been prevented, and factually wrong to suggest Britain is not helping Sierra Leone in its hour of need.' More than 40 British military personnel and aid experts are working in Sierra Leone following a direct request for assistance from the World Health Organisation and the country's government. More than 160 NHS staff are due to travel to Sierra Leone after answering a call for volunteers to help fight the disease earlier this month. Doctors and scientists are in a race against time to find a medical solution to the epidemic that is spiralling out of control. Select committee chairman Sir Malcolm Bruce said the scale of the crisis 'may well be connected to declining levels of international support for health system improvements' in Liberia and Sierra Leone. 'In the midst of this devastating epidemic, and at a time when the UK has reached its 0.7% target for overseas development assistance, it is wrong for the UK to cut its support to these two countries by nearly a fifth,' he said. 'The planned termination of further UK funding to the Liberian health sector is especially unwise. 'The UK can be proud of the work DfID has done to help deliver many improvements in Sierra Leone and Liberia following the civil wars in both countries. We believe that this work should continue through bilateral aid programmes. 'It is also good that in the short time since our report was agreed DfID has provided extra support for Ebola and many NHS staff have volunteered to go to Sierra Leone. 'However, UK ministers must now work harder to track the use of sector support given to Liberia and Sierra Leone through multilaterals we help fund.' Experts believe they have a 90-day window to halt the spread of Ebola, which could otherwise have infected around 1.5 million people by January . Experts believe they have a 90-day window to halt the spread of Ebola, which could otherwise have infected around 1.5 million people by January. The death toll from the highly infectious condition, which has spread across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, has reportedly risen to more than 3,000. At least 3,700 children have lost one or both parents to the virus since the start of the outbreak, according to preliminary Unicef figures, with fears that this could have doubled by the middle of next month. Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'The UK Government has taken the lead on supporting Sierra Leone to tackle this crisis, but it cannot act alone. 'The scale of the Ebola epidemic is devastating and growing every day, with five people infected every hour in Sierra Leone last week. 'We need a co-ordinated international response that ensures treatment centres are built and staffed immediately. 'This is not only an immediate humanitarian threat, but risks completely undoing the hard work which has been done to build up fragile health systems in Sierra Leone and Liberia after the devastating wars of the past few decades.

"Californian biologist Andrew Hessel says, 'Cells are living computers and DNA is a programming language,' but warns that this could lead to viruses and bacteria used to 'hack' human minds . The field of 'synthetic biology' is in its infancy. We can 'tweak' the genetics of life forms - but billionaire entrepreneur Craig Venter only created 'artificial life' for the first time last year, christening his life form 'Synthia'. But experts working within the field believe that our expertise is out-accelerating natural evolution by a factor of millions of years - and some warn that synthetic biology could spin out of control. It could lead, says Andrew Hessel of Singularity University, on Nasa's research campus, to a world where hackers could engineer viruses or bacteria to control human minds. Hessel believes that genetic engineering is the next frontier of computing. 'This is one of the most powerful technologies in the world,' says Hessel 'Synthetic biology - the writing of life.' 'I advocate that cells are living computers and DNA is a programming language.' 'I . want to see life programmed and used to solve global challenges so that humanity . can achieve a sustainable relationship within the biosphere,' he says.It's growing fast. It will grow faster . than computer technologies.' He predicts a world where we can 'print' DNA, and even 'decode' it. But he warned, in a speech at technology conference TXM, that viruses and bacteria send chemicals into human brains - and could be used to influence, or even 'control' their host. A literal virus - injected into a 'host' in the guise of a vaccine, say - could be used to control behaviour. Hessel warns that we 'may have to learn how to counterattack' against such weapons. Could 'artificial life' pose a threat to humanity? Security expert Marc Goodman said, 'Synthetic biology will lead to new forms of bioterrorism,' and said, 'Bio-crime today is akin to computer crime in the early Eighties, Few initially recognised the problem - but it grew exponentially.' When billionaire entrepreneur Craig Venter 'created life' last year by adding synthetic DNA to a bacteria cell, Professor Julian Savulescu, an Oxford University ethicist, said: 'Venter is creaking open the most profound door in humanity's history, potentially peeking into its destiny.This could be used in the future to make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable. The challenge is to eat the fruit without the worm.' Hessel, however, is generally optimistic about the future of synthetic biology. The scientist - who had a vasectomy because he 'never trusted the process' of natural reproduction, says, 'We are going to make synthetic genomes - . human genomes. It will make cloning  look organic. It will make human . reproduction look quaint.' Computer World blogger Darlene Storm says, 'I know people who can't even keep their computers protected, updated and patched - I wonder if they would be more security minded when the hacking could be lethal?'","Synthetic biology is 'out-accelerating evolution' - expert .

"Visitors to the Missouri State Fair have revealed their disgust over a stunt involving a rodeo clown dressed as President Obama. At the fair, paid in part by tax dollars, an announcer tried to whip the crowd up into a frenzy, asking who wanted to see President Obama 'run down by a bull'. The stunt on Saturday has raised fresh concerns about how ridiculing President Obama is nothing more than thinly veiled racism. Scroll down for video . Anger: A rodeo clown dressed as Obama has angered visitors to Missouri State Fair . One of the other rodeo clowns wobbled the lips of the Obama mask, and the man wearing it was forced to run after a bull gave chase, according to a man who witnessed the event. A couple who had taken a foreign exchange student to the fair to show them American life said they left in disgust after seeing the offensive stunt, according to the Kansas City Star. According to the paper, a Facebook post by Perry Beam said: 'The announcer wanted to know if anyone would like to see Obama run down by a bull. The crowd went wild.' He added that the announcer repeated the question, getting 'louder each time, whipping the audience into a lather'. Senator Claire McCaskill called the event shameful and unacceptable, according to CBS St Louis. 'The young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse - that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the President of our great nation,' Ms McCaskill said. The Jackson County Democratic Party also issued a statement that called the rodeo 'a show as ugly any you could see.' 'Encouraging physical harm to the President, whatever the party, is not acceptable and should not be tolerated,' the statement read. Anti-Obama sentiment is high in rural Missouri, where the President lost 60-40 per cent to Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. Outcry: Many people took to Twitter to condemn the rodeo act . However, the rodeo clown dressed as . Obama was considered by many to be a joke too far, especially . considering the fair, which sells itself as being suitable for people of . all ages, is said to have received about $400,000 from Missouri tax . payers. Jeff Mazur, executive director at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, was one of many people who took to social media to condemn the event. 'I like rodeos, I like funnel cake. I like the MO State Fair. Barely-veiled racism, anti-Americanism and violence fantasies ruin them,' he said on Twiiter. His comments were backed by several Republicans, including Jeremy LaFaver, who said he would no longer be taking his family to the state fair. St Louis treasurer Tishaura Jones tweeted on Sunday: 'Racism rears its ugly head at MO State Fair ... the fair needs to do a better job welcoming ALL Missourians.' According to CBS St Louis, she added: 'Since November 2008, racism has been masked under the guise of ""anti-Obama sentiment"".' State Republican Gail McCann Beatty said she was angered and disgusted by 'the blatant racism', adding: 'This is an embarrassment to the People of Missouri.' Caleb Rowden, another Republican, added on Twitter: 'I don’t agree w/ this Prez on . many things. But he is deserving of respect and shouldn’t be the object . of political stunts. Out of line!' Boycott: The stunt led to some families and politicians saying they will stop visiting the fair . Several people have taken to the state fair's Facebook page to state their disgust at the rodeo show, saying it was disrespectful and claiming they would boycott the fair next year. A spokesman for Missouri State Fair told Mail Online: . 'The performance by one of the rodeo clowns at Saturday’s event was . inappropriate and disrespectful, and does not reflect the opinions or . standards of the Missouri State Fair.' Kari Mergen added: 'We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday’s rodeo badly missed that mark.'","Stunt condemned as racist and demeaning by families who witnessed it .

"An armed robber who died when eight have-a-go heroes sat on top of him during a bungled jewellery shop raid said 'I can't breathe' shortly before his death, an inquest has heard. Clint Townsend died when shoppers piled on top of him during a raid at Oxford's historic Covered Market in March last year. The 33-year-old, who was wearing motorcycle gear and a helmet, had smashed the window of a jewellery shop repeatedly with a sledgehammer, before wrestling with the store's manager and owner. Onlookers had gone to the aid of jewellery shop staff after seeing Townsend and another man attacking the store with a sledgehammer and smoke bombs. They forced the 33-year-old would-be robber to the ground and kept him there until police arrived. Scroll down for video . Clint Townsend was sat on by passers-by and two employees of the jewellery shop he tried to raid in the historic Covered Market, in Oxford, an inquest has heard . Mr Townsend was suspected of putting smoke bombs and smashing Gowing Goldsmith & Jewellers window with a sledgehammer when he was sat on until police arrived, a coroner was told . He was found to be unresponsive and was given emergency first aid, before being rushed to hospital, where he died the next day. Flooring company owner Darren Maunder and his employer Oliver Lewis, who had been working in the historic covered market in Oxford, on March 30 last year, spoke of the raid at an inquest today. Mr Lewis said that as he walked past he heard the man being held down say something like 'I can't breathe' a number of times but his voice was muffled by the helmet. A woman bystander then said: 'I think it's just an act.' Mr Lewis told the inquest: 'I would have thought he was using it as a get-out-of-jail-free card.' Recalling the events, Mr Maunder said: 'We heard a mighty bang. It sounded at first like a bomb had gone off or something had gone wrong. 'We're always wary of a loud noise and I thought something had happened to one of my chaps.' He said he and Mr Lewis went to investigate and saw a large man being pinned to the ground outside John Gowing Jewellers, a motorbike on its side and a hole in the window of the shop. Townsend and an accomplice were dressed in motorcycle gear and had the visors of the helmets pulled down as they walked towards the jewellers pushing a stolen Kawasaki motorbike . Eight people piled on top of Townsend in a 'melee' at Oxford's historic Covered Market . Mr Maunders said: 'A lady said it was all under control and police were on their way. 'It didn't look like he was moving. It looked like (they were) just holding. I didn't see any punching or kicks or anything like that.' Assistant Coroner Alison Thompson asked: 'Did anybody look as if they were using extreme force?' Mr Maunders replied: 'No. They were just restraining him.' The coroner asked the same question of his colleague and he too said he did not believe excessive or unreasonable force was being used. 'I thought it was kind of under control,' he said. Both Mr Lewis and Mr Maunders said that as they watched, another man wearing paint-spattered tracksuit, looking like a painter-decorator, appeared and approached the group on the ground. Mr Maunders said: 'He said: ""Get off him, get off him"". 'It was quite strange really. It was obvious he knew the guy. My impression was he was something to do with it (the robbery). 'You would never recognise the person on the ground. Why would you be telling them to get off unless you knew the person.' The man then walked on and disappeared down an alleyway. The Covered Market has been operating for more than 200 years in a building dating back to the 1770s . Police were called to the scene after reports that two men had arrived at the jeweller's shop, one pushing a motorbike, and begun attacking it. One man was hammering at the window where the highest value diamond goods were and they also threw smoke bombs into the store. When the shop owner and manager confronted and tackled the man with the hammer, other members of the public then went to their aid, while the second raider fled. Shortly after arriving and handcuffing the suspect and removing his motorcycle helmet police realised the man was extremely unwell and at 9.21am they called for an ambulance. They also began attempting to resuscitate him. Townsend was taken to hospital at 9.44am but pronounced brain dead at 1.15pm the following day  and his life support system was turned off at 5pm. The inquest into the death of Townsend, of Headington, Oxfordshire, continues.","Clint Townsend stopped breathing when people piled on top of him .

"A cancer sufferer whose medical policy ran out half way through his treatment has shamed his insurance company into agreeing to pay his hospital bills - by targeting its CEO on Twitter. Insurance company Aetna agreed to pay 'every last penny' of Arijit Guha's medical expenses after the student was left with a bill of $114,000 and rising. The 31-year-old said he was 'in shell shock' and was relieved after the company's CEO Mark Bertolini agreed to pay out - despite the company telling him there would be a cap on his medical insurance policy. In remission: Arijit Guha, an Arizona State University doctoral student, said he was in 'shell shock' at the decision . Arijit, a Phd student at Arizona State University, was aged 30 when discovered he had colon cancer after returning from a trip to India. Stomach pain, which he initially thought was bug picked up on his trip, was diagnosed as stage four colon cancer a month later. However, it was only after his diagnosis that he learned his insurance company were to restrict payment for his treatment. While he was still able to receive life-saving treatment, Arijit - who is now in remission - had no way of paying for it and was facing potential medical bankruptcy. Despite taking out a policy under the university's health plan, which cost him $400 a month, its carrier Aetna had an annual cap on pay-outs. Arijit discovered soon after undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, he had exhausted his policy's lifetime limit of $300,000, ABC reported. Mark Bertolini (left), CEO of Aetna, had an online Twitter exchange with Arijit Guha (right) before speaking directly with him on the phone . Arijit took to Twitter to highlight his case, out of frustration and desperation . Despite the law abolishing lifetime limits, under the Affordable Healthcare Act, this did not include student health plans until August 1. Out of desperation and frustration, furious Arijit took to Twitter to highlight his case. The company responded with this tweet: 'We care about members. We want you to be empowered to be healthy and make informed decisions.' To which Arijit replied: 'That's so sweet that you want me to be . empowered. Does [Mark Bertolini] care to empower me by paying my $118k - . and counting - in bills?' Other Twitter users waded in on the argument, many mocking the choice of words used by Aetna. 'It's a battle I never should have been waging, but things were what they were and I'm so absolutely thrilled we won!' One user, @Chris_Ashworth posted: '[Aetna} want you to be *empowered to be healthy*! They are denying you coverage to *empower* you. See?' Another, @ItsLerema tweeted: 'My bud, a PHD students with Stage 4 [cancer] was shamefully kicked off his insurance. Btw congrats [Mark Bertolini] on the $10.6m CEO salary.' It was at this stage Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini responded to the tweets, denying Arijit had been kicked off his policy. Arijit asked him: 'True or false: I am in this situation because your company offers a crappy product?' And Bertolini replied: 'False. Why do you think the premium was so low? Do you look at your policy limits when you buy other insurance (auto)?' The cancer sufferer than asked: . 'Moreover, isn't it morally reprehensible that you offer such a limit . product? One that caps benefits so low?' After a flurry of angry online exchanges continued between the two and their discussion then moved to the telephone. Wading in: The online exchange prompted a series of angry tweets from other Twitter users . However, the next day Arijit made the announcement via his Facebook page that Aetna had backed down. He wrote: 'Breaking news: Aetna just agreed to cover the full extent of my bills. Every last penny.It's a battle I never should have been waging, but things were what they were and I'm so absolutely thrilled we won!' Before his victory with Aetna, Arijit had launched a fundraising campaign called Poop Strong - based on the cancer survivor Lance Armstrong's slogan of Live Strong. He had managed to raise more than $100,000 by selling t-shirts with the Poop Strong logo on them to pay for any ongoing and future treatment - a sum he now plans to donate to charity now that Aetna has agreed to pay his bills. CEO Bertolini - a former paramedic - later tweeted: 'The system is broken and I am committed to fixing it. I am glad we connected today and got this issue solved, I appreciate the dialogue no matter how pointed.' Arijit told ABC News: 'I am incredibly pleased and in shell shock and trying to figure out what just happened. It's a huge relief.'","Aetna CEO agrees to pay 'every last penny' of student's medical bills .

"Health officials are investigating a possible case of Ebola at Primary Children's Hospital in Utah, it has been confirmed. The patient, who has not been identified, had recently traveled to a country in Africa where transmission of the Ebola virus has not yet been reported, chief of pediatric infectious diseases Dr Andrew Pavia told a press conference. He said the patient was admitted on Wednesday and insists it is unlikely they have the deadly virus. Scroll down for video . Revealed: A patient who has just returned from an African country not yet affected by Ebola is being tested for the deadly virus at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, today . However, medics at the Salt Lake City hospital are for the first time employing the center's emergency plan created to tackle the disease. A spokesman said: 'While we have determined it is unlikely that the patient has Ebola virus, Primary Children's has taken this opportunity to use the emergency plan that we have been working on for the past few months in order to provide the maximum protection to staff, patients, families, and the greater community in the event we do have a patient with an Ebola infection in the future.' Pavia said the hospital was merely taking advantage of the opportunity to test its emergency system and that an alternative diagnosis became evident while doctors worked with the patient today, KSL reported. He added that the patient would pose no risk of infection to other patients or staff as the virus is spread through close bodily contact, not through the air or casual contact. He did not reveal details of the alternative diagnosis. Tests taken today have been sent to the CDC's headquarters for evaluation as part of the hospital's test.

The Japanese Embassy was second with 48,520 fines and a bill of £5,623,040, followed by the Russian Federation Embassy in third place with 44,145 fines and a bill of £5,123,450. The High Commission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria came fourth with 39,604 and £4,552,745 while the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany was fifth with 34,051 and £3,928,680. The Transport for London figures were revealed by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Mark Simmonds in a written ministerial statement. There were also 5,662 unpaid parking . fines incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in . the UK in 2013 totalling £541,599. Worst offender: The US Embassy (pictured) topped the table for the highest number of fines and largest outstanding bill, with 70,637 fines handed out and a total outstanding bill of £8,172,245 . In a separate written statement, Mr . Simmonds said: ‘The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has held . face-to-face meetings with a number of missions about outstanding . parking fine debt. ‘In addition, in April this year we . wrote to diplomatic missions and international organisations concerned . giving them the opportunity to either pay their outstanding fines or . appeal against them if they considered that the fines had been issued . incorrectly. ‘Subsequent payments (including amounts . waived by councils) totalled £197,423. There remains a total of £344,176 . in unpaid fines for 2013.’ A breakdown of embassies with outstanding parking fines totalling £1,000 or more as of June 27, 2014 showed the High Commission for the Federal Republic of Nigeria notched up £74,557 in unpaid parking fines, followed by the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia with a bill of £30,690.

The total amount of outstanding National Non-Domestic Rates (NNDR) owed by foreign diplomatic missions increased by 7 per cent on the previous year, a separate FCO written statement showed. Mr Simmonds said: ‘As at June 30 2014, the total amount of outstanding NNDR payments owed by foreign diplomatic missions as advised by the Valuation Office Agency is £726,076, an increase of 7 per cent over the 2012 figure, as reported in my 2013 WMS (£674,110). Mutli-million pound problem: Foreign embassies have notched up more than £75million in unpaid London congestion charge debt over the last decade . ‘However, £72,137 of this outstanding debt is owed by Iran - which is in the process of reopening its embassy in the UK - and Syria, which is not currently represented in the UK. ‘We have therefore been unable to pursue these debts. Three missions are responsible for just over half of the remainder. We shall continue to urge those with NNDR debt to pay their dues.’ He added that diplomatic missions were obliged to pay only 6 per cent of the total NNDR value of their offices, representing payment for specific services such as street cleaning and street lighting. A breakdown of diplomatic missions with . an outstanding NNDR bill over £10,000 in 2013 showed the Embassy of the . People's Republic of China owed £146,564.

"A boy at a top London school woke up during a sex assault to find he was in his paedophile teacher's bed and wearing his underwear. The revelation came as a former student claimed three of her classmates killed themselves after being abused by William Vahey. The 64-year-old has been described by the FBI as one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time. The American woman, who gave her name only as Alysia, was taught by Vahey when she was 12 at Saudi Aramco Schools in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Vahey taught at the international school between 1980 and 1992. Scroll down for video . Spanning the years, and the globe: William Vahey, pictured, committed suicide after allegedly confessing to molesting young boys 'my whole life' Vahey, pictured with his wife Jean, killed himself at a US motel last month as FBI agents were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing dozens of graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008 . She told Sky News:  ‘There were three suicides of very popular students of his that were molested by him. I could not believe that this guy was still teaching students. ‘That was the rumour that Bill Vahey molested children and that ultimately three children committed suicide as a result.’ However, when questioned if it was a rumour or fact, she immediately added: ‘It’s not a rumour. I know these people.’ The woman, who said she was in seventh grade at the Saudi Arabia school when she was taught by Vahey, described him as inappropriate. She said: ‘I found him to make inappropriate remarks to his class. He would make jokes about the male genital and I thought that was very inappropriate for 12 year olds to hear. ‘He was very arrogant. There were just rumours all over the place about ‘Bill’ Vahey and his behaviour.’ She also said the teacher had ‘favourite boy students’, giving them ‘better recommendations’ and ‘better grades’ than others. Despite finding him ‘inappropriate’, the American woman said she was unaware of Vahey’s behaviour while she was at school and said she started to hear rumours during a school reunion, . She said: It surfaced after we left Saudi Arabia - during a reunion everyone was talking about ‘Bill’ Vahey and his behaviour with male students.’ Vahey targeted young boys at a number of international schools over several years. FBI investigators said more than 100 potential victims had come forward after Vahey committed suicide at a US motel last month . Natalie Salmon, 23, who was at a school where the paedophile teacher worked in Venezuela, said:  'It's so sad, and it's the first time where I've thought to myself as a girl I am safer than being a boy' Vahey, a U.S. citizen, targeted young boys at a number of international schools including the elite Southbank International School in Westminster, London, where he took pictures of himself abusing up to 60 sleeping students during class trips abroad between 2009 and 2013. FBI investigators said more than 100 potential victims had come forward after Vahey committed suicide at a US motel last month. His death came as FBI agents were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing dozens of graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008. The . sickening images depicted children aged ten to 14 at the international . school, where he taught history and geography and led trips to Jordan, . Nepal and Venezuela. Another . 30 children, who also appeared to be unconscious or asleep when the . assaults took place, were pictured from other schools he worked in . during a 40-year career spent teaching at ten American international . schools in nine countries. An FBI affidavit revealed the extent of Vahey's crimes around the world . The father of two plunged a knife into his chest two days after confessing that he had abused boys throughout his life using sleeping pills. The news comes after it was revealed the teacher allegedly drugged his victims with sleeping tablets – by hiding them in cookies – before abusing them on school trips. While working at schools around the world, the teacher was said to have held a ‘cookie race’ at bedtime in which children as young as ten were encouraged to eat as many as they could, unaware they had been drugged. Once the pupils passed out, some were assaulted. The revelations did not come as a surprise to a former pupil known as Jonathan, who said there was something 'not right' about Vahey from the start. He told The Guardian: 'I had my suspicions from the beginning. There was something a bit off about him. 'Other people would say he was their favourite teacher but I would say there was something not right.' Another former student of Vahey's said the revelations were a 'complete shock'. Natalie Salmon, 23, who was at a school where the paedophile teacher worked in Venezuela, said:  'It’s so sad, and it’s the first time where I’ve thought to myself as a girl I am safer than being a boy.’ Miss Salmon said she remembered Vahey as being a 'nice, shy sort of guy', but that her male friends from school now refuse to even speak about the possibility they were his victims. An FBI affidavit obtained by the Daily . Mail showed how he catalogued the sex abuse by time and location in . folders on a USB memory stick entitled ‘Panama trip’, ‘Costa Rica trip’ and ‘Basketball trip’ and ‘Spring 2013’. The . document says: ‘These images depict minor males in various states of . undress... The minor males appear to be asleep, unconscious or possibly . drugged.’ A former student of a school in the Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia, pictured, claims three pupils committed suicide after being abused by Vahey . Breeding ground: Vahey taught at the elite £25,000-a-year Southbank International School in Westminster, London, pictured, right up until last year . Vahey, who left Southbank International School last year, was only caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a memory stick containing the vile images . Saudi Aramco Schools is a group of schools run by the Saudi Arabian Oil Co - a prolific oil company based in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia . Saudi Aramco Schools is a group of schools run by the Saudi Arabian Oil Co - a prolific oil company based in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The school campuses are situated in four Saudi Arabian Oil Company communities: Abqaiq and 'Udhailiyah in the south, Dhahran in the central area and Ras Tanura in the north. The Saudi Aramco Schools group was founded in 1945 and currently has around 3,100 students from nursery age up until around 15 years. Most of the students are the children of the company’s expatriate employees. Students will only be accepted to the schools if they speak proficient English and were 'successful at their previous school'. All of the campuses follow an American curriculum and all of the school sites are modelled on North American schools. Classes run from Saturday to Wednesday, with weekends on Thursday and Friday in conformance Saudi Arabia's working week. Vahey, who left Southbank International last year, was only caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a memory stick containing the vile images. She was sacked but later passed the USB stick to administrators at the American School in Managua, who dismissed Vahey after recognising his hand in the images. In 1970, while studying for a teaching degree, Vahey was jailed for 90 days after pleading guilty to molesting boys at a swimming pool where he was working as an instructor in California. He was required to register as a sex offender for life, but after graduating from college in 1972 failed to sign the register. In 2010 an inspection report had warned of a weakness in staff vetting measures at Southbank International, but Sir Chris Woodhead, chairman of the governors said yesterday that it was ‘irrelevant’ in Vahey’s case as he was not on the sex offender’s register. Sir Chris said there had never been a complaint against Vahey, although there was one incident where a boy was ill on a trip and Vahey took the boy into his room to look after him. A school investigation subsequently found ‘nothing untoward’.","William Vahey, 64, allegedly abused up to 60 boys at leading private school .

"It looks like Beats by Dre have been, well, beat. The days of NFL football players and coaches sporting the popular headphones during televised interviews are over for now.

"Coventry have been ordered to pay almost £500,000 to main creditor Arena Coventry Limited within the next seven days by the Football League, though it could put the League One club closer to a return to the Ricoh Arena. The governing body held a board meeting on Thursday to discuss the matter of unpaid dividend payments from the Sky Blues' period in administration last season after the League One club had sought a reduction to the £600,000 figure. They felt a previous payment of £300,000 to ACL, whose dispute with the club led to the Sky Blues playing their home matches at Northampton's Sixfields Stadium last year, should have been taken into account along with further costs incurred during the liquidation of the club's old operating company. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the ever optimistic Coventry fans having sing and a dance . Football's coming home: Coventry look set to return to the Ricoh Arena following a dispute with creditors . The Football League upheld the argument over new costs but rejected the issue regarding the previous payment. Therefore, the Sky Blues must now pay ACL £471,192 by August 14. The Football League's chief executive Shaun Harvey said: 'This has been a complex and unwelcome disagreement within a wider, more significant dispute. By concluding this matter, we can now allow all parties to concentrate on the more important issue of getting Coventry City playing its matches back in Coventry at the earliest opportunity.' Sky Blues chief executive Tim Fisher is happy that the main stumbling block over the club's potential return to playing their home games in Coventry can be overcome. He said in a statement: 'The board of the Football League made its decision on how much the club should pay to ACL in respect of the dividend payments from Coventry City Football Club's period in administration. 'We know that ACL saw the payment of this money as a barrier to agreeing terms to get the club back to Coventry. We can today put this obstacle behind us and get down to the business of negotiating a return to Ricoh Arena until we can own our own stadium. 'As we have said all along we want what is best for the long term future success of Coventry City FC. That means our job is to get the club back to Coventry, which is something every single supporter wants to see, whilst ensuring the financial stability of the club.

"Just 16 seconds after two police officers pulled up in a patrol car and confronted Kajieme Powell, he was dying in a hail of bullets. The young black man had been behaving erratically for some minutes, seemingly waiting for the police to come and get him after he walked out of a shop in St Louis, Missouri, with two stolen bottles of energy drink. Scanning the street outside as he paced back and forth, he kept one hand thrust into his pocket, clutching the knife he was about to brandish. But as recorded by a local man with a mobile phone, Powell’s end was brutally swift — and arguably unnecessary. After telling him repeatedly to drop the knife he drew from his pocket, the officers both opened fire with their handguns when he was about 10ft away. Witnesses said 25-year-old Powell was shouting: ‘Shoot me! Shoot me!’ Kajieme Powell, 25, pictured left and right, was seen leaving a shop in St Louis, Missouri, with two stolen bottles of energy drink. He was filmed scanning the street outside, pacing back and forth . Police later said he had been moving towards them threateningly, but that hardly seems obvious in the video footage. After letting off at least nine rounds — three times the number the entire British police fired in anger last year — the tragedy veered into farce as the officers decided to handcuff his lifeless body. What makes Tuesday’s shocking video footage particularly explosive is that it was taken just three miles from Ferguson, the St Louis suburb which has been convulsed by serious unrest after a white policeman shot dead unarmed black youth Michael Brown two weeks ago. The latest killing is guaranteed to inflame racial tensions in the U.S. already reaching boiling point, and to fuel accusations that trigger-happy white police are mowing down young blacks without compunction. Such claims — which for years have soured America’s boasts to have overcome its ugly racist past — were compounded this week by alarming new footage of a policeman threatening to kill peaceful demonstrators in Ferguson. The officer, who has been suspended indefinitely, was filmed repeatedly shouting: ‘Get back or I’m going to f***ing kill you,’ as he aimed his semi-automatic assault rifle at protesters. While officers in Ferguson have faced serious disorder in recent days, critics have pointed out that the almost military response of the police has served to exacerbate the problem by attracting violent troublemakers to the town. In the process, this Midwest backwater has thrown up images of civil unrest the like of which haven’t been seen in the U.S. since Los Angeles was torn apart in 1992 after police were cleared of beating up black motorist Rodney King. Last Sunday night, a man in his early 20s with a bandana covering his face was seen confronting an army of riot police. At one point, he lifted up his vest to show the handgun tucked into his low-slung shorts. It was unclear whether it was a warning, or a show of defiance. At that point, it was 12.45am, well past the midnight-5am curfew set earlier that day, and the police were intent on clearing the main artery running through this working-class suburb. Five heavily armoured SWAT team trucks had lined up across the street with around 100 riot police behind them. Dressed in combat gear, gas masks and army helmets, and armed to the teeth with shotguns and assault rifles, they started advancing, firing tear gas into a 300-strong crowd who threw back bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails. After police arrived, the 25-year-old was filmed walking towards the car, brandishing a knife which he had drawn from his pocket. Witnesses said Mr Powell was shouting 'Shoot me! Shoot me!' And so it has gone on, night after night for the two weeks since — just 100 yards away down a side street — officer Darren Wilson shot dead 18-year-old Brown. For days, events in Ferguson followed a routine. As darkness fell on this suburb of 21,000 people, the locals who had demonstrated peacefully during the day headed home, and the mood turned uglier. The street was filled with young — mainly black — men from out of town, sporting the occasional gang tattoo, who taunted the police with insults, chanting: ‘Hands Up, Don’t Shoot’. Taking the lead have been megaphone-clutching professional agitators from radical groups such as the Revolutionary Communist Party, who try to incite fights with the police. These Left-wing rabble-rousers tend to be white, infuriating local black leaders who accuse them of hijacking the protest. The protesters have each night been faced by an impassive battle line of local and state police. Clad in head-to-toe combat gear and aiming sniper rifles, they look  more like soldiers. As well as firing tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets, they have even used a sonic cannon — or Long Range Acoustic Device — which emits a noise like a deranged ambulance siren. While he was 10ft away, the two police officers opened fire. They then handcuffed Mr Powell's lifeless body . At 8.30pm on Sunday night, to the sound . of sporadic bursts of gunfire, the violence took an ugly turn. Police . claimed they were being shot at in ‘pre-planned agitation’, and went on . the offensive. The tear gas started all over again, this time catching . ordinary people still out on the streets. An eight-year-old boy was . among those gassed. On Monday, the police reported coming under ‘heavy gunfire’ and arrested 78 people as they tried to stop the looting. Two demonstrators were shot but not — police insisted — by them. That night, officers were bolstered by the National Guard, who arrived in a fleet of Humvee armoured cars after Missouri governor Jay Nixon took the drastic measure of calling them in. Some community leaders said they had seen different street gangs working together to attack the police, and that members had said they wanted to kill a policeman in revenge for Brown. Nearly six years after the U.S. elected its first black President, the unrest in Ferguson has graphically illustrated how the country’s race relations are as rancorous and turbulent as ever. For all the feelgood, liberal waffle about Barack Obama’s supposedly ‘post-racial’ America, the last Western country to ban slavery within its borders is still rife with racial tension. The incident took place three miles from where an officer shot dead an unarmed black youth, Michael Brown, just two weeks ago . The trouble started two weeks ago today after a scuffle involving Brown and 28-year-old Wilson ended with the teenager being fatally shot in a burst of gunfire. Accounts as to how this happened differ sharply, although there seems to be agreement that Wilson was inside his patrol car and Brown was leaning in through an open window as they argued whether the officer had the right to tell him to stop walking in the street and get on the pavement. The policeman’s gun then went off — according to the officer, because Brown punched him in the face and tried to grab the weapon. But according to Brown’s companion, Dorian Johnson, Wilson grabbed his friend around the throat and started firing when he tried to run away. Despite Obama hoping the racial divide would be healed in the U.S., no one expects the president to do much about the latest incidents . Some witnesses say they saw Brown turn around and move threateningly towards the policeman, others say he stayed stock still and might even have put his hands up. Either way, he was shot six times, including once in the face and again in the head. Wilson has gone into hiding, suspended on full pay, while a grand jury considers whether to bring charges, a process that can take weeks. Why might Brown have become violent? Possibly because — according to the town’s police chief — Wilson had realised that the teenagers fitted the descriptions of two youths who had just stolen cigarillos from a nearby convenience store. While locals painted Brown as a sweet kid keen to go to university, police released video footage of the shoplifting. It showed a huge teenager — apparently Brown, who was 6ft 4in — sauntering out of the store, shoving aside a small shopkeeper who tried to stop him. His friend Johnson has reportedly admitted he and Brown stole the cigarillos, but the dead man’s furious family accused the police of trying to poison their son’s name and somehow justify his shooting. The video helped to divide reaction to the killing along racial lines: local community leaders say Ferguson is a powder keg that could blow up again any time, so long as the policeman remains uncharged. One thing’s for sure, no one expects Obama — once a charismatic speaker decrying racial injustice — to do much about it. Last week, he broke off briefly from holiday on the millionaires’ island of Martha’s Vineyard to appeal for calm, blandly assuring protesters he understood ‘the passions and anger’. D emonstrators insist they are protesting about far more than just the case of Brown. Curfew-breaking protester Kerry Green said it was about everyday racial prejudice by the police. ‘It’s about us riding down the street with three friends in the car and we get pulled over,’ he said. Locals say it’s hard for outsiders to understand the depth of the divide in Ferguson, where a two-thirds black population has a 53-strong police force, of which only three officers are African-American. Publicity hungry civil rights veterans such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have followed the TV news crews pouring into town, anxious to ram home how this case symbolises everything wrong with America. Michael Brown is ‘not on trial’, Sharpton thundered at a local church on Sunday morning. ‘America is on trial!’ However hyperbolic the language, it’s true that at the heart of this troubling story is the racial schism which once more threatens to tear apart the fabric of American society. When such men as Kajieme Powell and Michael Brown are killed, white Americans see a criminal and officers who must protect themselves; black Americans see racist police who treat them with contempt. More than 50 years after Martin Luther King made his I Have A Dream speech about bringing an end to racism in the U.S, it seems black and white Americans mistrust each other almost as much as ever.

"Demba Ba left behind plenty of friends at Chelsea when he moved to Besiktas this summer but he can’t disguise some irritation that Jose Mourinho never gave him a proper chance at Stamford Bridge.

But he was only ever called upon by Mourinho when Fernando Torres and Samuel Eto’o were unavailable. VIDEO Scroll down for Demba Ba completes transfer to Besiktas from Chelsea .

Ironically, Ba came very close to joining Wenger’s team a year ago. Mourinho scuppered the deal at the 11th hour after running scared of the Gunners when they signed Mesut Ozil. ‘I always said the move to Arsenal was close. I thought the deal was done and I would just go and do the medical, but it went another way,’ said Ba. ‘Jose has said why it didn’t happen. He was honest, he just didn’t want to give them a striker who could score goals, especially with the arrival of Ozil. Now I am playing Arsenal in such a big match. It’s crazy but I’ve no regret on everything that happened.’ Good pals: Demba Ba describes former Chelsea team-mate Eden Hazard as one of his best friends . Ba is already a cult hero in Istanbul, something special in a city of 20 million people where the passion for football is all-consuming. After a low-key debut for his new club in a pre-season friendly at Macclesfield of all places, Ba’s hat-trick against Feyenoord earned Besiktas their place against Arsenal. The winner over two legs will earn a place in the Champions League group stages and a minimum of £30m, vital to the Turkish club who finished third in their league last season and are building a new stadium. Ba thinks his side have an outside chance of causing a shock. ‘Our team are very young and still learning,’ he said. ‘We will have a very tough game against Arsenal, but we want to go through to the Champions League spot and get the six matches in the group stages.’ Hopeful: Ba thinks his new  side have an outside chance of beating Arsenal in the Champions League play-off . Ba was an unused substitute when Chelsea thrashed Arsenal 6-0 in March and is happy to pass on any tips to his new team-mates. ‘The calibre of Chelsea’s forward players is a little different, but we have a lot of young players who are very rapid and very comfortable with the ball,’ he said. ‘Maybe we can learn from the Arsenal game at Chelsea and cause damage in the same way.’ It was a real coup for Besiktas manager, ex-West Ham and Everton defender Slaven Bilic, and Turkish football in general to persuade Ba to leave the Premier League. ‘I made the decision because of the love they showed me for many weeks,’ he said. ‘I knew the club and the fans really wanted me and when you get this kind of love, you don’t hesitate too much.’","Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba claims former boss Jose Mourinho didn't select him as he wasn't a star name .

"In space, no-one can hear you scream. And that's the main problem former astronaut Buzz Aldrin has with Will Smith's latest sci-fi film After Earth. A day after attending the New York première of the post-apocalyptic thriller, the second man to walk on the Moon said the film was a great family drama. But, he complained, the space scenes were unrealistic. 'There was a lot of noise. In space, you don't get that much noise,' he said. 'In space, you don't get that much noise': Buzz .

Stars of the show: Jaden and Will Smith strike a pose in front of the After Earth promo poster . Aldrin, who followed Neil Armstrong onto the surface of the moon during the historic Apollo 11 landing in 1969, explained that 'noise doesn't propagate in a vacuum. We talked over headsets.' 'Fortunately, we were free of static. We could communicate with each other pretty clearly, and mission control, though we were 50,000 miles away,' he said. The 83-year old former space man was the . guest of honour at an event for a new luxury camera from Hasselblad. The . Swedish company has supplied cameras used in space missions for more . than 50 years. Aldrin said he enjoyed the father-son dynamic between Will Smith and son Jaden, but thought there was a little too much 'Shoot'em-up' for his taste. 'I hope the aliens are more peaceful than they are in this film, wherever they are,' Aldrin joked. Father-son dynamic: The Smiths play a father and son team sent back to Earth a thousand years after humanity fled the planet due to numerous environmental catastrophes . Adventure: The pair crash land on the surface of the planet, losing their colleagues in the process, and it is up to Jaden to make a perilous journey across uncharted land and signal for help . Not well received: New York Post's Lou Lumenick said: 'Most of the film consists of Kitai (Jaden) traveling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon, and then trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal . In space no-one can hear you scream because sounds are carried in the form of compression waves, meaning that they must travel through a medium such as air. When we hear a sound caused by a slamming door, for example, what happens is that the impact of the door on its frame compresses nearby air molecules and this compression propagates through the air until it reaches our ears. In space, however, the environment is a virtual vacuum, with hardly any molecules for the sound to pass through. Those molecules that are around are extremely far apart. So, if you were to slam a door in space, the impact would more than likely not affect any neighbouring molecules and, even if it did, those molecules would not be near to any others to form a wave. That means the vibration of the slamming door would not travel to your ear and you would hear nothing. Or, as Buzz Aldrin rather succinctly put it: 'Noise doesn't propagate in a vacuum' However, Aldrin's enthusiasm for After Earth's dramatic quality has not been shared by film critics, who have lambasted the movie. The Smiths play a father and son team sent back to Earth a thousand years after humanity fled the planet due to numerous environmental catastrophes. Unfortunately they end up badly damaging their spaceship in an asteroid field, and as the rest of the Ranger Corps troops travelling alongside them die when they crash land, it is up to Jaden to make a perilous journey across uncharted land and signal for help. In his one star review of the film, the New York Post's Lou Lumenick says: 'Most of the film consists of Kitai (Jaden) travelling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon, and then, even less interestingly, trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal.' And Variety's Scott Foundas had his knife out for the stars' acting, claiming: 'The senior Smith gives one of the least substantive performances of his career, while the undeniably charismatic Jaden toggles between two primary modes of expression: paralysing fear and simmering rage.' The Washington Post's Michael O’Sullivan is even more scathing in his assessment of the teenager, arguing he 'spends much of the movie running around in a panic, waving his little arms at predators and shouting, “Leave me alone!” 'It’s appropriate to the character, I guess. But it’s also more than mildly annoying. Kitai comes across as a whiny, wilful and one-dimensional brat.' The Apollo 11 team: From left, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin pose in this file photo . 'Magnificent desolation': Buzz Aldrin pictured on the surface of the Moon during the 1969 Apollo 11 mission . Despite the critics' scathing assessments, and his own admission that he preferred the more realistic sci-fi work of Arthur C Clarke, Aldrin said he was impressed by the set design of earth 1,000 years into the future. 'The scenes of the cities were really remarkable,' Aldrin said. That differed significantly from his experience on the Moon. 'The place was just totally lifeless, and that prompted me to use the words, ""magnificent desolation"" in contrast to the magnificent experience that humanity could move itself ahead to get to the Moon,' Aldrin said. 'And as Neil says, that was sort of a small step for man, but to me the giant leap is establishing permanence on another planet.' Aldrin wants it to be Mars, but feels it won't happen in his lifetime, unless he's 'really, really long-lived.'","'Noise doesn't propagate in a vacuum,' the former space man explains .

"There will be some Manchester United supporters that take the view that no Liverpudlian should ever captain this famous club. Let alone one, in Wayne Rooney, that has twice agitated for a transfer in the past four years. This particular Scouser has, however, now spent ten years with Manchester United, happens to be the club's 3rd highest goalscorer and is also likely to break Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time record of 249 goals in the coming seasons. Wayne Rooney is the pragmatic selection for Van Gaal at a time when this football club is not blessed with true leaders. Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra and Ryan Giggs have all vacated the dressing-room this summer and United have lost over 2,000 appearances worth of experience in just a few months from the squad's playing-staff.

Vocal: Wayne Rooney makes his feelings known with the captain's armband proudly on his sleeve . When Manchester United fall behind - not once, but twice - at Old Trafford, it is to these experienced minds, who have recovered in the face of adversity so many times, that the players would usually look. Following the mass exodus of the veterans this summer and a host of first-team players - Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck in particular - unavailable, this was always going to be a tricky afternoon for Louis van Gaal. On Saturday lunchtime against Swansea, with so many young or fringe players in the side, the onus was on the newly-appointed captain Wayne Rooney to step forward. Rooney has always been vocal on the pitch, urging his defence up the field and demanding more from those around him. Such burning ambition will only intensify with the armband. In the first-half, as United curiously toiled without purpose in Van Gaal's favoured 3-5-2 system, Rooney struggled to influence the game, unable to find space either deep or in the final third. It did not help his case that those around him - principally Juan Mata and Javier Hernandez - were so ineffective, barely peeping out of a cloak on anonymity.

The change to 4-4-1-1 in the second half afforded Rooney greater room and he was central to United's efforts, acrobatically turning home a Juan Mata corner and linking intricately with Adnan Januzaj as Van Gaal's team sought to overturn the 1-0 deficit. Just a few moments before Swansea retook the lead through Gylfi Sigurdssson, a Rooney free-kick curled around the wall and clipped the outside of the post. That, sadly, was his last contribution of note. On this frustrating afternoon, Rooney's most eye-catching work was of perspiration, rather than inspiration. As the clock ticked down and United surrendered timidly, Rooney tried to motion his team forward. Ultimately, the quality just was not there and that, sadly, is a damning indictment of the situation Van Gaal has inherited at Manchester United.

"Imagine never being able to let anyone, even your partner, see you in your natural state. It may sound ridiculous but this is the reality for  Lara Peterson, from Nantwich, Cheshire, who is crippled with insecurities about her appearance without makeup. The 25-year-old office administrator admits: 'My boyfriend didn't see me without makeup on until after a year. 'I haven't been confident about my skin since I was about 15 and started suffering with acne. Scroll down for video . Lara Peterson admits her boyfriend didn't see her bare faced until they had been dating over a year . 'Although I would describe myself as a confident person, without my war paint I start to feel anxious and it totally affects my personality….even now. 'From about the age of 17 I have never let a boyfriend see me without my makeup until at least a year down the line. 'I would panic that they wouldn't find me attractive without my flawless finish and was scared to see the look on their faces when they did see me au natural. I went so far as to always wear waterproof mascara on holidays away together and never put my head under water for fear that was makeup mask would be washed away.' Despite her obvious natural beauty, Lara's lack of confidence means she ensures she is never seen without a full face of makeup, regardless of the reassurances of those around her. 'My friends and my boyfriends have always said they think I am mad and that I look just as beautiful without my make-up but it's a confidence issue that I have and no matter what others say I know I look far better when my blemishes are concealed. 'I do feel much more comfortable 'in my own skin' these days as I have had various skin peels and lazer treatments  and the affects have been amazing. 'However if me and my partner were to split and I was to embark on a new relationship I still wouldn't dare to bare any sooner.

Women are more confident baring their bodies to a partner than their make-up free face . A survey of women between the ages of 18-30 and found that over half (54 per cent) wouldn't let their partner see them without cosmetics until they had been dating at least 12 months. In contrast the majority (51 per cent) said they would bare their bodies after just six months, suggesting the nation's females are more confident with their bodies than their skin. Maxine Flint, owner of skincare brand Flint + Flint, who conducted the research,  comments: 'We were shocked to find out so many women feel so insecure about their skin that they would hide behind their makeup for such a long length of time. We would have expected less body confidence than skin shyness.' 'It's a shame that us women appear to have so many hang ups about ourselves and we hope that our Flint + Flint beauty range will help to bring some well-needed confidence back.

"Actress Lindsay Lohan is currently in London performing in new West End show Speed-the-Plow . She forgot her lines — at least five times — and managed to fluff her only major speech of the play. The audience laughed but it was at her, sadly, not with her. As an ambitious Hollywood secretary called Karen in a new West End production of David Mamet’s Speed-the-Plow, Lindsay Lohan spends a lot of the play staring into a book she hopes to turn into a film. When the audience is left wondering whether the tome was just a prop or actually contained her lines, it’s a fairly desperate state of affairs. As the cast and crew of the Playhouse Theatre production absorbed the audience feedback yesterday, you have to ask whether this was all part of the script. Cynics have always wondered why the play’s producers and director offered the only female part — in a cast of just three people — to an actress so mired in notoriety and incompetence that her ‘performances’ nowadays tend to come from Californian police stations, courtrooms and rehabilitation clinics. Was it a brave attempt to give a second chance — or a third or fourth — to a 28-year-old Hollywood actress who once showed great promise? Or was it the most cynical exercise yet in hanging a production on a star name, encouraging punters to come and experience whatever the theatrical equivalent is of ‘car crash TV’? To be fair, it wasn’t complete carnage — most agree she improved after a nervous and shaky start — and Lohan had prepared everyone not to expect her to be perfect. She admitted recently she was having trouble learning her lines after so long out of acting and that, apart from a childhood Cinderella show, she’d never been on stage. Hardcore ‘LiLo’ fans in the audience were predictably enthralled by her performance although for others, initial amusement at the slip-ups soon turned to annoyance. Many made their views clear on Twitter, congratulating the unseen woman prompter who was feeding Lohan her lines or noting how the actress laughed every time she got something wrong. A critic from the online newspaper The Daily Beast reported how, halfway through the second act, ‘the audience was openly laughing at Lohan’s struggle to grasp Mamet’s sharp, trademark dialogue’. When one of her fellow cast members told her ‘You have done a fantastic job!’, many onlookers couldn’t help but titter. The same happened when — in a moment of supposedly tragic introspection — Lohan’s character admitted: ‘I know what it is to be bad, I’ve been bad.’ She certainly has. But Lohan insists she wants to be good now. In interviews she has confided how she sees moving to London for the play as a new phase in her life — adding that it could become a permanent move away from the temptations she has succumbed to in Los Angeles and New York, and from the constant public scrutiny she has endured. She says she wants people to ‘focus on the fact that I’m in this industry because I’m an actress and artist, and not just someone you take photos of’. Scroll down for video . The child actress (pictured aged 11) starred as Haley Mills in the remake of the 1950s film The Parent Trap . This striving for professionalism hasn’t quite seen an accompanying change in her social life yet. She is regularly being photographed emerging from London’s hottest restaurants and nightclubs in shimmering party dresses when she might have been tucked up in bed with a cocoa learning her lines. Lohan has reportedly racked up as much as £300,000, according to one source, on clothes, hotels and bar bills since she came to London in July to start rehearsals for the play. She’s understood to be living in a private flat in Mayfair after initially staying at various expensive hotels, and has been a regular late-night fixture at the trendy celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse. Lindsay’s image certainly wasn’t helped either after a U.S. magazine in March published a long list of lovers that the actress had written down, supposedly to impress friends during a boozy night out. Among the 36 names were actors Orlando Bloom, Heath Ledger, Colin Farrell, Justin Timberlake and Ashton Kutcher. Lohan claimed she had compiled them as part of her therapy at the Betty Ford addiction clinic. Lohan arriving at the Playhouse Theatre in central London for her first performance of Speed-the-Plow . We haven’t heard much about her on the men front during her London soujourn — or on women for that matter, as Lohan reportedly went through a lesbian spell in LA with British DJ Samantha Ronson. But she insists that’s because she’s so intent on reviving her acting career. ‘Being here in London is all about me this time,’ the red-headed actress said earlier this month. ‘Yeah, English guys are cute, but it’s not about the boys. It’s about getting away from New York and Los Angeles and starting afresh, which is all very exciting for me. I love London and lived here for eight months once before, so it feels like home.’ The transatlantic move has certainly meant a break — so far — from the endless headlines about her arrests for drunk-driving, shoplifting and assaults, coupled with her court appearances, stints in rehab and even spells in prison. Even by Hollywood’s high standards, few stars could hold a candle to Lohan when it came to drugs and drink binges, on-stage tantrums and no end of dysfunctional, diva-like behaviour. It was as a sweet-faced, freckled 11-year-old that she came to prominence, playing a set of twins in a remake of the sister-swap film The Parent Trap. Roles in teenybopper films such as Freaky Friday and Mean Girls followed. She was hailed as the next big thing, and became a role model for countless teenage girls. But like many child stars, the pressures of fame began to tell. She was soon banned from nightclubs for unpaid bills and wild behaviour. A string of convictions followed. She was arrested for driving under the influence of drink or drugs, possession of cocaine and for stealing a £1,600 necklace from a shop. Sometimes she turned up to her court hearings — sometimes she didn’t bother. A year ago, it emerged she was broke and living in her teenage bedroom at her mother’s house on Long Island, New York. Her last major acting venture, a 2013 erotic thriller called The Canyons, attracted such notoriety that her re-emergence in any dramatic endeavour is a small miracle in itself. In a New York Times article headlined ‘This is what happens when you cast Lindsay Lohan in your movie’, a reporter who had sat in on the entire film-making process told how Lohan had brought the low-budget film to its knees with her continual absenteeism, screaming fits and feuding with cast and director. Lohan confirmed the report was ‘pretty accurate’. Critics said the shambles illustrated how a cynical Hollywood was ready to exploit a clearly damaged and troubled young woman willing to do almost anything to revive her career. The film’s tawdry, nudity-filled script was about a group of decadent young people desperate to break into films. Lohan had to act alongside a porn star, playing her rich boyfriend, who invited men and women to his Malibu mansion to have sex with her. The role meant full nudity as well as being filmed in a foursome with three porn actors. Most actresses would have run screaming from such a prospect, but when the film’s producer contacted her agent, Lohan jumped at the chance. She made clear she believed the role could have been written for her, even though she was paid only £63 a day with a share of any profits. ‘We don’t have to save her,’ Paul Schrader, the film’s director, cynically told members of the crew appalled by the notoriously unreliable Lohan. ‘We just have to get her through three weeks in July.’ Lindsay Lohan starred alongside Amanda Seyfried, Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert in 2004's Mean Girls . The New York Times reported how Lohan was so poor at turning up to rehearsals that Schrader pretended to sack her. She sat outside his hotel room in tears pleading for a second chance, but her behaviour veered off track again when filming started. When the time came to film the (simulated) four-way sex scene, she shut herself away in a walk-in closet where she drank with a friend for two-and-a-half hours. When she eventually emerged, she refused to take off her dressing gown until the director, in desperation, stripped off himself to persuade her to go naked. Even the final day’s filming proved disastrous after Lohan hit the town with her pop star friend Lady Gaga. When she turned up three hours late after having had next to no sleep, Lohan’s personal doctor suddenly turned up on set. He declared her too ill to continue working and sent her home. Her porn actor co-star, James Deen, compared Lohan’s behaviour — sometimes refusing to come out of her dressing room — to a ‘child lashing out’. It wasn’t entirely her fault, he added generously, as she had been ruined by a Hollywood system that had left her lost and confused if she wasn’t instantly indulged. For all her naked, bed-hopping endeavours, the film played in just a handful of cinemas before going straight to video. It would be surprising if Lohan was able to get away with anything like that sort of behaviour in the West End, but then despite her struggling performance on Wednesday night, she does appear to have raised her game. She has proved she can get to the theatre on time, deliver most of her lines and accept a bouquet at the curtain call without hurling it at anyone. By Lindsay Lohan’s standards, that is progress.","Hollywood actress is currently starring in West End show Speed-the-Plow .

"Alastair Cook has said he is happy with Jimmy Anderson’s on-field behaviour and will not be asking the leader of his attack to tone down the verbals in Thursday’s fourth Investec Test in Manchester. Cook’s defence of Anderson came only a couple of hours after the ICC chief executive David Richardson said he would not be appealing against Justice Gordon Lewis’s decision to exonerate both Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja following their set-to in the Trent Bridge pavilion last month. But Richardson also warned that there was there was ‘no place in the game for the use of offensive language that is personally insulting of one player by another’ – a statement that seemed aimed squarely at Anderson following events in Nottingham. Happy: Alastair Cook (left) does not want James Anderson (right) to tone down the verbals on the pitch . Jekyll and Hyde: Anderson is composed off the pitch but changes when he is playing . Cook admitted he had never played with a cricketer whose off-field and on-field personas were as different as Anderson’s. But he said: ‘I don’t think anyone should moan about it, because what happens on the field should stay on the field and off the field you should be a nice guy. ‘The way both sides have played this series has been fantastic, about from that one incident which has been blown up. Both sides have been very competitive and played it in the right spirit. ‘Every time you pull on the shirt you’re role models for kids. We’re aware of that, but we want to play competitive cricket, not nicey nicey, and everyone say you’re playing in the right spirit. There’s always that muddied line. ‘We want to play competitive cricket, don’t need to change too much. I am happy with Jimmy Anderson and his conduct. There are little bits where he might have overstepped the mark but I’d rather he was on that line than too passive. He needs that for his bowling. Back up off the floor: Cook was boosted by his own performance and that of his team in the win over India . Recipe for success: Cook will look to build on the victory at the Ageas Bowl . ‘Jimmy’s an experienced cricketer and he’s found his method that he needs to be England’s second-leading wicket taker. I'm pretty sure he'll be England's leading wicket taker very soon and that's an outstanding achievement. He's found his way of doing it. ‘I know it’s very special for him to play at a home Test match. For him to be playing here means a lot for him. That was his biggest concern, that he wouldn’t be able to play at Old Trafford.’ Cook also praised Steven Finn for fighting back from a situation in Australia where he was deemed ‘unselectable’. Finn could play his first Test for 13 months if he’s picked on a surface that is expected to suit his height and bounce – with Chris Jordan the man most likely to miss out. Cook said: ‘It’s great, from where I last saw him in an England shirt in that one-day tour, to what he’s now delivering for Middlesex, and briefly how bowled to us in the nets at Lord’s and here these last two days as well. ‘It’s great for English cricket that he’s back to his best. He’s very different to what we’ve got. He’s a tall bowler who when he gets it right bowls at 90mph. 'That’s a good thing to add to the pot. It’s been a very tough six months for him personally to fight through it, and I think he’ll be a stronger bloke for it. It should bode well for his cricket.’ VIDEO Cook hints at Finn return .

Meanwhile, India captain MS Dhoni said he had no regrets over pursuing the case against Anderson, and said it was up to individual captains to control their players. But he said match officials should play a greater role in ensuring the game is played in the right spirit: ‘It’s important that cricket has strong characters – no matter what side they play for. But what needs to be done is for umpires to step in if the individual crosses the line. If the individual stays within the guidelines, it’s good for the game. ‘If he carries on being abusive and cannot curb his instincts, he should definitely be punished.’","Anderson was in hot water for alleged altercation with Ravindra Jadeja .

"Wealthy foreigners who buy and sell British property could face a new tax under plans being considered by George Osborne. The Chancellor is looking at putting capital gains tax on the UK homes of foreign owners in his Autumn Statement next month. Such a move could help curb the housing bubble in London and the South East, where demand for homes from Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern investors has helped spark a price boom. Homes for the super rich: A property on Kensington Palace Gardens, London, on the market for £200,000,000. Foreign investors are attracted to properties in London because they benefit from generous tax breaks . It is unclear how much the tax would raise but the Treasury is thought to have costed the measure. British homeowners have to pay capital gains tax (CGT) – typically 28 per cent – if they make a profit when they sell a property that is not deemed to be their main residence. But foreign investors are exempt from tax on all properties – making London homes in particular an attractive option. The booming demand has sent property values across the capital soaring by an average of 10 per cent in the past year, pricing many locals out. Estate agents Knight Frank believe 70 per cent of new-build properties in prime areas of Central London go to foreign buyers. Experts say imposing CGT on foreign owners would do less damage to the UK housing market than the ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth more than £2million proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Lucien Cook, a director at estate agent Savills, said: 'Proposals to tax the capital gains of non-UK resident property investors are a much more targeted and much less controversial solution to the perceived inequalities in the taxation of high value properties than a blanket mansion tax. This could significantly reduce the case for a mansion tax.' He said 'it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed' in Britain. But he added: 'This move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell.' Priced out: Booming demand from overseas buyers has sent property values across the capital soaring by an average of 10 per cent in the past year, pricing many locals out . Grainne Gilmore, Knight Frank's head of UK residential research, said: 'Tax is not the primary reason why global property investors come to London, but a change of this sort would have an impact.' The British Property Federation warned that new taxes on property will damage the UK's status as a country that is 'open for business' while doing little to curb rising prices. Liz Peace, BPF chief executive, said: 'House prices are rising due to a chronic shortage of new homes, not because of foreign investors, and until this supply issue is dealt with it makes no sense to slap kneejerk taxes on people who want to spend money in the UK and contribute to the UK economy. 'Uncertainty of this kind is hugely damaging to Britain's image as a country that is open for business, and far outweighs the paltry sums which this tax would raise - indeed it is only with foreign investment that many London schemes are able to go ahead. 'We know from bitter experience that some foreign investors will have seen these headlines and will already be thinking twice about whether or not to invest in the UK.'","Foreign buyers currently pay no capital gains tax on sale of UK property .

"For all his bravado about his drug use in his new memoirs, Stephen Fry appears to have shrunk from revealing all the famous places where he has taken cocaine. The list, in his new book More Fool Me, includes Buckingham Palace, the House of Lords and Windsor Castle. But Fry left off two high-profile locations he had previously admitted to, that could land him in trouble. In his new book More Fool Me, comedian Stephen Fry, 57, (pictured) admits taking cocaine at a number of high-profile institutions including Buckingham Palace, the House of Lords, Windsor Castle and at The Ritz . However, he fails to mention in the book that he took it at the White House (pictured) and at 10 Downing Street . In a radio interview in 2012, Fry claimed he had also taken the class A drug in the White House and at 10 Downing Street. He told New York station WNYC: ‘I thought I might begin my next book by having simply a list of all the places where I’ve taken a line of cocaine. 'Like a bathroom in Buckingham Palace, in the gents in 10 Downing Street, in the White House, in this place, in this place.’ Fry, 57, did not identify which president or prime minister were in office at the time, and a reluctance to embarrass the politicians may explain why he left the locations off the list. Admitting criminal behaviour in the White House could also have serious repercussions for the actor. America can bar anyone who has admitted drugs offences from entering the country, even if they have not been charged. Fry, 57, (pictured meeting The Queen earlier this year) appeared to forget when writing his new book that he already admitted that he had taken the Class A drug at the two high-profile locations in a radio interview in 2012 .","Stephen Fry said he took drugs at Buckingham Palace and other institutions .

"Hard-line Christian reality TV star Phil Robertson took a religious stance on ISIS in an interview Tuesday, while failing to concede that his solution looks eerily like the Islamist group's. 'Convert them or kill them,' Robertson told Fox News on Tuesday after Sean Hannity asked for the Duck Dynasty patriarch's take on the group currently waging a religious war across the Middle East. While the Millionaire duck hunter neglected to consider the irony of his words, he did suggest that only one of the possibilities would likely work. 'Convert them or kill them': Phil Robertson takes radical stance on radical Islam but fails to acknowledge his solution sounds like the religious war being waged by ISIS . 'At war with us': Robertson's take on ISIS came as he was interviewed by Sean Hannity on Fox just hours after the US authenticated the second video of an American beheading by ISIS . '[Converting them} I think would be next to impossible,' admitted the 68-year-old. Robertson called the terror group 'street thugs on steroids,' during the Fox interview which came as the Louisianan tours the country to drum up publicity for his new book unPHILtered, which came out Tuesday. Robertson's Fox appearance came just hours after US officials verified the authenticity of Steven Sotloff's beheading--the second such horrific video made by ISIS militants. Robertson quoted the Bible, as he often does, in the interview. He did the same thing in an earlier ABC News interview as he defended himself in the wake of criticism for controversial stances on gays and African-Americans. 'I'm as much of a homophobe as Jesus was,' Robertson said. 'The people who are participating in homosexual behavior, they need to know that I love them.'

Robertson was on Fox, in part, to give his take on matters of massive global importance like ISIS, he's not one to follow the news--at least not if it involves using internet. ‘I don't own a cell phone. I've never turned on a computer in my life,’ he said this week. While the admission doesn't give the controversial man much credibility on matters of state, it does allow him to enjoy his millions with his peace of mind intact. ‘So whatever America is saying or not saying about me, true or untrue, what they need to understand is I'm not hearing it,' he continued.","Hard-line Robertson says it's Jesus or death for radical terror group .

"The gambler eyed the cards being laid out on the baize table and murmured quietly to his attractive Asian companion. She had accompanied him, he told the staff at the London casino, purely for 'good luck'. But why then was she the one talking to their female dealer in Mandarin Chinese, persuading her to oblige her friend's extreme superstitiousness with all manner of harmless little changes to the high stakes game of baccarat he was playing. Some might have been suspicious, but casinos love the so-called 'high-rollers' willing to gamble millions in a single session. And they didn't come much more high-rolling than Phil Ivey, regarded as the world's greatest poker player. Scroll down for video . A Mayfair casino will not have to pay poker player Phil Ivey (left) £7.7million in winnings after a High Court judge ruled the 'edge-sorting' technique he used, helped by Cheung Yin Sun (right), was cheating . His arrival at Crockfords in Mayfair, Britain's oldest casino, the previous night had caused genuine excitement, not to mention a gleeful rubbing of hands. As a casino inspector paced the private room, hung not only with chandeliers and oil paintings but also a battery of security cameras, the scene one August night two years ago could have come straight from the pages of Ian Fleming. Especially when the couple coolly walked out at the end of two nights of gambling that had seen a staggering £106 million won and lost at various times. In the end, they had made £7.7 million at James Bond's favourite card game. Their achievement was all the more impressive because Punto Banco, the version they were playing, involves no skill whatsoever. His arrival at Crockfords in Mayfair, Britain's oldest casino, the previous night had caused genuine excitement, not to mention a gleeful rubbing of hands . This week, the same pair were back in Central London, this time in the High Court, for an equally high stakes game as Ivey, an American, tried to convince a judge he had not been cheating and the casino had no right to withhold his winnings. Indeed, Ivey felt so confident in his case — the biggest legal battle in British casino history — that the American stunned the gambling world by admitting precisely how he did it. And the truth was even more ingenious — Crockfords might prefer the word 'devious' — than anything James Bond ever faced. For Ivey, 38, and his companion — no casual observer but one of the sharpest operators in Las Vegas — were 'edge sorting'. That means he and Cheung Yin Sun were able to 'read' the cards by spotting imperfections on the back of them. Crockfords and its owners, the £21 billion Genting Group of Malaysia, were not prepared for this when Ivey came to play. He was 16 when he told his parents in New Jersey he was going to become a professional gambler. He developed his poker skills playing colleagues at a telemarketing firm, went on to win countless World Series 'bracelets', or championships, and is regarded as the best all-round player on the planet. He now lives in Las Vegas, after divorcing his wife, and his life is dedicated to the game. So when he contacted Crockfords and told them he would like to come to London and lay seven-figure bets on its tables, the casino was keen to accommodate him. High-rollers can make a huge difference to a casino's balance sheet. However much he won or lost, it would be good for the casino's image to have the 'Tiger Woods of Poker' on the premises. Ivey was 16 when he told his parents in New Jersey he was going to become a professional gambler . He asked to play in a private room with a 'Mandarin-speaking dealer because Ms Sun doesn't speak good English'. Crockfords was also happy to allow a range of other unusual requests. Baccarat players are notoriously superstitious as the game is purely down to chance . He wanted to wear his 'lucky hat' and to be able to choose a 'lucky' pack of cards — he specified the Angel brand made by the U.S. company Gemaco — that the casino would then use for the entire time he was playing there. This pack had to be dealt and shuffled in a 'lucky' way. The idea of Punto Banco is to bet on which hand of cards — the player's or the dealer's — adds up closest to nine. Players first place their bets, then the cards are dealt face-up. Each hand contains a minimum of two cards and a maximum of three. Tens, jacks, queens and kings are all valued at zero — so sevens, eights and nines are the most important cards in the game. To begin with, the game was going Crockfords' way. During several hours of play Ivey made repeated requests for decks of cards to be changed. This continued until he found that 'lucky' pack he wanted. But it wasn't luck. Ms Sun had finally spotted the deck of playing cards she had been looking for. Angel brand cards have a purple-coloured diamond pattern on the back. An expert at 'edge-sorting', Ms Sun knew some of these packs have a tiny — but crucial — flaw. The geometrical pattern on the backs of cards is supposed to be symmetrical, but on these it wasn't. Looked at very closely, the pattern along the long edge on one side of each card is noticeably different from the long edge on the other. What the pair of gamblers managed to do next was crucial. Ms Sun asked the dealer to rotate the 'strong' cards — the sevens, eights and nines — by 180 degrees 'for luck' before they were put back into the pack. This transferred the pattern flaw to the opposite side of the card — from the left side to the right — which meant all the 'strong' cards had the flaw on the same side of the card, and it was a different side from that of all the other cards. Armed with this information, Ms Sun and Mr Ivey could tell whether the dealer was about to deal a 'strong' card as the first card in each hand. All they had to do was study the back of the top card waiting in the card 'shoe', or dispenser, used by the dealer and Ivey would place his bet accordingly before the game began. In this way, Ivey turned the game from the dealer's advantage to his advantage — and raised the stakes. Betting as much as £150,000 a hand, he and his companion gradually started winning and winning. But unless anyone was aware they were carefully studying the backs of the cards rather than the front, they would have been at a loss to explain what had happened as anything other than a tremendous streak of good fortune. When the pair finally got up to leave, they were told it was a bank holiday the following day. Given they would have flown back to the U.S. by the time banks were open again, the money would be wired to Ivey, said Crockfords. However, the casino clearly realised something was fishy because it never sent him the money and returned only his £1 million stake money. The argument rumbled on until, in May last year Ivey announced he would be taking legal action, saying: 'I am deeply saddened Crockfords has left me no alternative. Over the years I have won and lost substantial sums at Crockfords and I have always honoured my commitments. At the time, I was given a receipt for my winnings but Crockfords subsequently withheld payment.' For its part, Crockfords clearly felt that Ivey had not won the money fair and square. So should the casino staff have realised far earlier than they did that Ivey's winnings were about something more than luck? Edge-sorting is just one weapon in the arsenal of so-called 'advantage players' — who try to find legal ways of improving their odds of winning. But Ms Sun has already been banned from at least one U.S. casino for doing it there. Ivey said he sees it as the professional gambler's job to 'exploit the weaknesses' of casinos, and try to even out the odds casinos always ensure are stacked in their favour. Edge-sorting, Ivey insisted in court, involves nothing more than using information available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards the casino chooses to use, and by making requests of the house which it is entitled to refuse. Crockfords, in other words, should have known better. Sadly for Ivey and 'advantage players' everywhere, Mr Justice Mitting, begged to differ. The judge, who admitted he has never been in a casino and sticks to bridge, commended the American on his truthfulness but ruled his actions amounted to 'cheating for the purposes of civil law'. Ivey will not get his winnings and will have to pay costs. Worse, the verdict won't help him in another pending legal suit, this time in the U.S. The Borgata casino in Atlantic City is demanding back $9.6 million that it says Ivey won from it in the same circumstances. Phil Ivey is estimated to have won $100 million from poker — entirely legitimately — and says he is most upset about being labelled a 'cheat'. Such a reputation is 'death' in his world, he told the High Court. But professional gamblers across the world made clear yesterday they believe he was hard done by and that anyone who tries to level the odds against an unscrupulous casino industry deserves praise. Even Hollywood star Ben Affleck, another keen 'advantage player', railed against casinos this month after a Las Vegas casino banned him for 'card-counting', in which players mentally keep a record of cards that have been played so they have a good idea of what cards will appear next. One feels sure 007 would never have stooped so low as counting cards or edge-sorting. Indeed, in the novel Moonraker, his boss M asks him to come to his club, Blades, and work out how the evil millionaire Drax is cheating at cards. Sure enough, he cracks it before the evening is out. Perhaps Crockfords should have called for Bond to run the rule over Phil Ivey — if it had, this sensational court case might never have taken place.","Phil Ivey tried to sue London casino Crockfords Club for his £7.7m 'winnings'

"Louis van Gaal's reign at Manchester United ended in defeat as Swansea City claimed a surprise 2-1 win. Here Sportsmail takes a look at what went wrong for the Dutchman during his first competitive game in charge of the Old Trafford outfit. United need a plan C . With Van Gaal's favoured 3-5-2 system exposed in the first half and United trailing 1-0 at half-time, United reverted to a 4-4-1-1 in the second-half in an attempt to liberate Adnan Januzaj down the flanks and Wayne Rooney up front. For the first 20 minutes of the second half, the plan appeared to be working as United equalised through Rooney and threatened to build up a head of steam. Swansea's second goal killed the United momentum and Van Gaal's team were unable to recover. In attack, it was too ponderous and too hesitant. Paul Scholes said on BT Sport: 'When we blitzed teams in the past, it was all about pace. Today, it's all nicey-nicey and taking too many touches. There isn't enough pace in the team.' Plan A did not work, plan B ran out of steam. Time for plan C - buy some high quality footballers. The philosophy can become irrelevant if the personnel is not up to scratch. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed down with result . Wrong system: Louis van Gaal may have to go back to the drawing board after Manchester United's defeat . Defensive reinforcements are required . We knew this before the game and it was confirmed once and for all on Saturday lunchtime. Admittedly hampered by the absences of Antonio Valencia, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw, Ashley Young ended up at left-back and he was predictably caught out for the second goal. Aside from the injuries, United desperately require at least one centre-half of elite-standing. Tyler Blackett was faultless on his Premier League debut but Phil Jones did not always appear convincing in the defensive three while Chris Smalling was easily beaten by Montero for the second goal. United need a world-class centre back that can provide guidance and assurance to those around him. Sporting Lisbon's Marcos Rojo remains a target but they should break the bank for Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund. Summer target: Manchester United have been linked with a move for Argentina's Marcos Rojo . Adnan Januzaj remains the star . For much of last season, Adnan Januzaj was the stand-out player for Manchester United and the only one who played without fear as the situation deteriorated under David Moyes. The Belgian - a little short of match fitness after returning late to pre-season following the World Cup - began this game on the bench but replaced the injured Jesse Lingard early on. Immediately, Januzaj demonstrated his talent, committing opponents and sprinting down the right flank. One piece of footwork to sidestep Jonjo Shelvey was breathtaking. He is the club's most exciting and courageous player and Van Gaal must find a way to fit him in. Shining light: Adnan Januzaj was one of Manchester United's . Van Gaal said it will take time . Louis van Gaal admitted this summer that it takes time to transplant his ideas. At Bayern Munich, Van Gaal's side were 7th after 13 matches in his first season, winning only five by the end of November. They did, however, go on to win the title. In one season at Barcelona, Van Gaal's team were 10th after 14 games. Again, they went on to win the title. At Ajax, it took three seasons before Van Gaal won his first Eredivisie title. United fans may need to be patient with their new manager. Buried: Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson (centre) put Swansea 2-1 ahead with a left footed strike . Van Gaal will give the kids a chance . Perhaps forced upon him due to injuries, Louis van Gaal started this match with six Englishman in the starting line-up and nine in the match-day squad. Nonetheless, we should not forget that players such as Marouane Fellaini, Shinji Kagawa and Nani started on the bench, as Jesse Lingard and Tyler Blackett were handed an opportunity. Six of the 10 British players in the squad were homegrown in the United academy. It is now 3,701 consecutive first-team games that Manchester United have had an academy product in the match-day squad. The run stretches back to 1937. With Van Gaal at the helm and Ryan Giggs as assistant manager, that record should be protected.

"A schoolboy drowned after jumping off a 10-ft high bridge into a river with friends despite not being able to swim. Twelve-year-old Hamse Darman jumped into the Jubilee River near Slough, Berkshire, with his friends but quickly disappeared beneath the surface. Emergency services were called to the . scene last night after Hamse’s friends rushed to nearby homes to raise . the alarm when he vanished in the murky water. Police and fire crews searched for the 12-year-old and found his body just after midnight this morning. Tragedy: Hamse Darman, 12, drowned after jumping off Wood Lane bridge, pictured, into Jubilee River near Slough, Berkshire . Neighbours told youngsters often ignored repeated warnings about the dangers of the river and continued their daredevil antics at the spot. 'They were jumping off the bridge into the water,' said a woman, who didn't want to be named. 'It was Hamse and two others. Hamse was not a swimmer so it looks like he has jumped in and got into trouble. 'The other two managed to get out and raise the alarm.' The river was especially constructed as . part of a flood defence scheme after years of torrential rain threatened . to engulf the flood plains around Slough, Maidenhead and Windsor in . Berkshire. She told how police, paramedics, firefighters and a police helicopter spent hours searching the water and the river banks for the boy. 'The Jubilee River is an overflow from the River Thames and although it appears calm, the current is very strong,' said the woman. 'The water is also far deeper than it looks and I have no idea what is in there.' Hamse is believed to have been a pupil at nearby Westgate Secondary School, where he had just completed his first year. Four bunches of flowers had been left on the centre of the bridge, which links Cippenham, Slough, to Eton. 'It is an absolute tragedy,' said the woman. 'But what nobody can understand is why they were jumping in yesterday when it wasn’t that hot. Tributes: Flowers can be seen on the bridge where Hamse had jumped off with his friends - just a few metres from a warning sign saying: 'No jumping, No Diving' 'When it has been really warm recently we have had lots of kids congregating up there and jumping in. 'Those who live around here are always telling them to be careful but they never listen.' A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'We were called last night to Wood Lane in Cippenham, to reports that a young boy had gone into the river. 'At about 8pm, the 12-year-old got into trouble in the Jubilee River. 'A full search was launched to find him but his body was discovered shortly after midnight.' Detective Sergeant Lucy Deane, from Slough CID, said: 'The incident is being thoroughly investigated but we do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances at this time. 'Our thoughts go out to the family of this young boy, who has become the victim of what appears to be a tragic accident.' She added: 'I also would like to emphasise that although it might be tempting to jump in the river when the weather is warm, there are often hidden dangers under the water and so we would advise against doing so.' Hamse’s body was taken to the mortuary at nearby Wexham Park Hospital for a post mortem examination to be carried out to determine the exact cause of his death. Police said the case had been referred to Berkshire Coroner Peter Bedford and a report would be compiled to allow him to hold an inquest. The Jubilee River was built in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the Environment Agency as a £110 million pounds scheme to protect surrounding towns from flooding. It is up to five metres deep in places. It was not known whether the agency had opened the gates to increase flow through the seven-mile channel following recent rainfall.","Hamse Darman jumped in the Jubilee River near Slough, Berks, yesterday .

"An online petition urging Sheffield United not to re-sign Ched Evans has gained almost 60,000 signatures. The former Wales striker was jailed for five years in April 2012 after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman on a night out in Wales. But the 25-year-old is due to be released in October having served half his term and is determined to get his career back on track. Ex-Blade: Ched Evans (centre) played for Sheffield United before being sent to jail . International experience: Ched Evans (left) in action for Wales against Scotland in 2009 . On trial: Ched Evans arrives at court ahead of his trial for rape . Following reports that United - who earlier this year confirmed they were in contact with Evans  - may re-sign the striker, a petition addressed to United chairman Kevin McCabe was started. It states: 'To even consider reinstating him as a player is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist. 'The message is that men who commit such atrocious crimes will suffer only a small penance whilst the women they attack suffer for the rest of their lives. Sheffield United Football Club must not reinforce that message.' Meanwhile, Rape Crisis England & Wales said United should think carefully before re-signing Evans. Former glory: Ched Evans (left) scores for Manchester City against Portsmouth in 2008 . National service: Ched Evans (right) celebrates scoring for Wales against Iceland in 2008 . Director of communications Katie Russell told Sky News: 'It is of course any convicted criminal’s right to serve their sentence and then go back into employment. We absolutely stand by that. 'But at the same time we would urge Sheffield United to think very carefully about the message that they send when they immediately re-employ someone who’s been convicted of such a very serious crime. 'If they choose to do that, which is their right, we urge them to seriously consider the impact that will have on huge numbers of their supporters and we urge them to make a very strong statement condemning sexual violence, condemning violence against women and girls and making it clear that misogyny, sexism, violence and sexual violence in particular won’t be tolerated within football.' Cleared: Clayton McDonald, in action for Port Vale and now of Tranmere, was found not guilty . Evans was found guilty of rape after the prosecution argued the girl was too drunk to consent to sex. Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, now of Tranmere Rovers, was cleared of the same charge. Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey has confirmed that he is looking to rebuild his career upon his release. 'All Ched wants to do is go back to work, do the job that he loves, play football, score goals and then just come home and have a family life,' she told Sky News. A Sheffield United spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can only reiterate the previous statements we have put out in relation to Ched Evans through the summer.' In April United confirmed they had been in contact with Evans since his imprisonment. 'The club can confirm that, as part of its ongoing policy of providing a duty of care to former employees and their families, it was in contact with Mr Evans subsequent to his conviction,' they said in a statement.","Evans jailed in 2012 after being found guilty of rape .

"Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo is being hit with disciplinary action by the club amid talk of him being wanted by Manchester United.

"Brendan Rodgers need not fear. If he wondered who would provide Liverpool’s magic after the sale of Luis Suarez, at least he still has ‘David Blaine’. That, thanks to Daniel Sturridge, is the moniker of Philippe Coutinho. According to the England striker, Coutinho is a magician with a ball at his feet and after watching the Brazilian tear Borussia Dortmund to shreds, Rodgers was only too happy to embrace that theme. Replacing Suarez like-for-like is something Rodgers admits is impossible but he has an idea of how to keep Liverpool a creative, vibrant, attacking force and — judging by this swaggering display — Coutinho is crucial to that master plan. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 'magical' Coutinho show skills in earlier friendly vs Brondby . Highly rated: Philippe Coutinho celebrates scoring against Borussia Dortmund at Anfield . Magic feet: Coutinho slides the ball past the keeper for Liverpool's third goal . 'David Blaine': Coutinho has been labelled a magician by team-mate Daniel Sturridge . Liverpool: Mignolet; Manquillo (Kelly 85'), Johnson (Enrique 61'), Skrtel, Lovren; Gerrard, Can (Lucas 46'), Henderson (Allen 80'), Sterling, Coutinho (Ibe 72'); Sturridge (Lambert 76'). Subs (not used): Jones, Toure, Sakho, Coates,  Suso . Goals: Sturridge 10' Lovren 14' Coutinho 49' Henderson 61' Borussia Dortmund: Langerak; Piszczek (Großkreutz 58'), Sokratis (Knystock 81'), Ginter, Schmelzer (Sarr 81'); Kehl (Bender 46'), Kirch (Immobile 46'), Mkhitaryan (Ji 64'), Aubameyang (Bandowski 76'), Jojic (Amini 77'); Ramos (Hofmann 46') Subs (not used): Bonmann, Subotic . Deployed in a central role just behind Sturridge and flanked by Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling, Coutinho was the architect of a friendly victory that sent Liverpool bounding into the new campaign, as he provided the assist for Sturridge’s 10th-minute opener and scored one of his own. Dejan Lovren — who excelled on his debut following his £20million move from Southampton — and Henderson also found the target but afterwards Rodgers reflected on ‘a successful pre-season’ while reserving a eulogy for Coutinho. ‘He is so gifted and the fans appreciated it because of the level of the opponent,’ said Rodgers. ‘His ability is just magical. His ability to get out of tight situations, his view of the game. That’s his best position too — playing between the lines, he tempts defenders out. ‘You saw that with the ball he played around the corner for the first goal. It’s about sustainability with him now. He’s lit up this country with his quality. We are now going on to a big stage in Champions League and he will have chance to show that there, too.’ Dortmund looked short of condition and presented far less of a challenge without star names Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels, but that could not detract from Coutinho’s quality. The weight of his passing, speed of thought and ability to deliver the perfect ball really impressed. It was no wonder that when he was replaced in the 71st minute the Kop gave him a standing ovation. Liverpool will look to renew his terms during the coming campaign — no problems are envisaged and he still has four years on the deal he signed when arriving from Inter Milan in January 2013 — and Rodgers believes Coutinho is now about to really make his mark. ‘He will show at that (Champions League) level that he is a top player,’ said Rodgers. ‘I see him over the next four or five years becoming a real talent in world football. VIDEO Liverpool desperate to challenge - Enrique . Everybody dance now: Daniel Sturridge shows off his customary celebration after scoring . Neat finish: Sturridge puts the Reds 1-0 up after just 10 minutes . Nutter: And Dejan Lovren makes it two just a few minutes later . Face grab: Henrikh Mkhitaryan challenges Jordan Henderson in the air . High riser: Lukas Piszczek vies for the ball in the air with Raheem Sterling . Curious to think, then, that Brazil overlooked him for the World Cup. where his guile and invention could have made a difference. Instead, he was forced to spend his summer watching helplessly from afar. ‘I felt anger (at not being selected),’ Coutinho said. ‘Not because I’m selfish, but I could have offered something. I will use this anger and push myself to my limits. I saw how Luis (Suarez) was a maniac in training. At this point, my body and mind feel like clay. I will mould it the way I envision.’ The other high point for Rodgers, who revealed that Lazar Markovic has a tendon problem that threatens to keep him out of next Sunday’s Premier League opener against Southampton, was the way Lovren eased into the centre of Liverpool’s defence. Liverpool shipped 50 league goals last season but Lovren showed enough to suggest that, of all the signings Rodgers has made, he could be the most crucial. ‘Dejan was just what I’ve been looking for since Jamie Carragher left,’ said Rodgers. ‘He is a dominant No 1 centre half, who reads it well, with good guidance of the back four. His qualities of range of passing too. He was excellent. ‘I’m delighted with the result as they have been one of Europe’s top teams. We got four really good goals and could have had a few more. We’ll be ready (for Southampton). We will have a behind-closed-doors game this week and I’m looking forward to next weekend.’ As well he might if Coutinho is in a similar, spell-binding mood.

Jubilation: And the England midfielder was delighted to make it four . Good job: Rodgers congratulates Sturridge on a quality performance after his substitution . 1. LIVERPOOL HAVE FOUND A ROCK AT THE BACK: . Brendan Rodgers tried numerous combinations and signed three players to fill the gap left by Jamie Carragher’s retirement but Dejan Lovren looks like providing the answer he has been looking for in the middle of his defence. The Croatian was impressive on his debut. 2. EARLY BLITZES MUST BE THE WAY FORWARD . It was only a friendly but Liverpool were lightning-quick out of the blocks against Borussia Dortmund and that tactic, which was so effective last season, will again be employed at Anfield. Daniel Sturridge and Lovren took the game away from Dortmund scarcely before it had begun. 3. RAHEEM GIVES STERLING SERVICE ON THE WINGS . Rodgers said after the game that Raheem Sterling could be ‘anything he wants’ and there is no doubt the young winger is maturing into a fine talent. If he produces his form of last season, he will be a fine bet to win PFA Young Player of the Year.","The young Brazilian was a constant threat to the German side throughout .

Harry Phillips, consumer PR manager of Betfair, said: 'We are all about excitement at Betfair, Louis van Gaal's arrival in the Premier League certainly brings that. 'United struggled last season, but van Gaal has given them a real lift and we wanted to celebrate what he will bring to the Premier League, he’s 5/2 to be manager of the month in August.

City wasted little time in publicly celebrating the Argentina forward's capture by creating their own billboard with Tevez which read 'Welcome to Manchester' to the chagrin of those connected with United. The billboard, which was located near Old Trafford, played on the fact that many City supporters claim their fans are from Manchester, whereas United's are more likely to be found in the south of England.","A mammoth billboard welcoming Louis van Gaal to Manchester United has been created in the city .

"Like Newcastle United 24 hours earlier, West Ham found Malaga too classy an opponent as the La Liga side lifted the Schalke 04 Cup following a comfortable 2-0 victory. The Hammers were taken apart in the first half as the Spaniards struck twice inside three minutes and missed a penalty before the break. Malaga were easy 3-1 winners against Newcastle on Saturday and they again toyed with a Premier League side here at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Alberto score for Malaga against West Ham . Celebration: Malaga players after Ezequiel Rescaldani scored to put the Spanish side ahead . Pressure: Sam Allardyce's side have not won a game in normal time during their entire pre-season . West Ham debutant Carl Jenkinson was also forced off with what looked like a hamstring injury one hour into his debut, the Arsenal defender having only joined on a season-long loan last week. Should the injury prove serious, manager Sam Allardyce could well re-enter the transfer market in search of defensive reinforcements. But the manager might also be concerned by the manner in which his side were torn apart midway though the first half. First Jose Rosales scampered down the right and centred for Ezequiel Rescaldani who flashed his header into the side-netting. Adrian: The Hammers keeper saves Liverpool loanee Luis Alberto's penalty in the first half of their friendly . Clash: Malaga's Pablo Perez and West Ham's Mark Noble compete for the ball during their friendly in Germany . But that let-off was a warning of things to come for the Hammers and Malaga duly put the game to bed inside three minutes. Rescaldani made strides into the penalty area and took full advantage of Winston Reid's half clearance before tucking beyond Adrian. Juanmi then escaped down the right flank and located Luis Alberto, on loan from Liverpool, at the far post and he did the rest with a smart finish, working room for the shot before curling into the far corner. Jenkinson was guilty of a blatant block on the tricky Alberto at the expense of a penalty on 30 minutes but the same player saw his weak effort blocked by Adrian. Headache: Arsenal loanee Carl Jenkinson looks dejected after West Ham concede their second . Penalty: The scoreline could have been worse for the Hammers but their keeper, Adrian, saved a penalty . West Ham United: Adrian, Jenkinson (Nash 62), Reid (Potts 78), Burke, Cresswell, Noble, Whitehead, Diame (Cullen 46), Jarvis, Vaz Te, Zarate . Malaga CF: Kameni, Perez, Angeleri, Rescaldini, Samuel Sanchez, Juanmi (c), Rosales, Sergio Sanchez, Boka, Alberto, Recio . Goals: Rescaldini 22, Alberto 24 . After the interval Rescaldani went in search of his second and saw Adrian palm over his vicious blast on 55 minutes. From the resulting corner the Argentine striker looped a header towards the far corner and Adrian was forced to backpedal and again shovel over the bar. Sergio Sanchez whistled an effort from range onto the roof of the net and Junapi somehow lashed wide of an open goal from six yards as Malaga continued to tease passes around the final third. Jenkinson then over-stretched in a 50-50 challenge and hobbled down the tunnel to add to Allardyce's woes.West Ham – with summer signing Mauro Zarate in attack – offered nought at the other end save for a Matt Jarvis run on goal but his heavy touch allowed keeper Idris Kameni to slide and clear. Allardyce will now step up his efforts to bring in a new striker ahead of the Premier League kick off a week on Saturday. Peter Crouch is a possibility and Sunderland's Connor Wickham could emerge as a target should his contract wrangle persist. But with Andy Carroll out until November and £12million signing Enner Valencia set to miss the start of the season, they remain worryingly short of attacking options.

"Jack Wilshere must improve his performances or face being excluded from the Arsenal starting line-up according to Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher. The Gunners midfielder played 69 minutes during Arsenal's opening day 2-1 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League, at which point the midfielder was hauled off in favour of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with Arsenal labouring at 1-1.

And according to Sky pundit and Sportsmail columnist Redknapp, Ramsey's contribution, as well as Mikel Arteta's captaincy has made it difficult for Wilshere to justify his team selection with Mesut Ozil still to return for the Gunners. 'All the midfield players Arsenal have got cannot get into this team, Redknapp told Sky Sports following the win. 'You've got Wilshere, Ramsey and Arteta, who is captain so has to play, Ozil to come back and and Cazorla. I think Wilshere has got it all on to get into this team. 'If he plays again like he did today, he could be surplus and he's one of England's best midfielders. But I can't see him getting a game at the moment. 'Jack WIlshere's problem is Jack Wilshere. He's not performing. He's got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago - there's no excuses anymore. 'It's nothing to do with smoking. I played with better players who smoked.

"A 29-year-old father-of-three has died in a skydiving accident in Southern California. Jason Granger, from Yuma, Arizona, was killed just before noon on Friday after he made a hard landing, according to the coroner's report. Police in the city of Perris responded at around 11:20 a.m. to reports of an air emergency at the popular skydiving site of Perris Valley airport. They arrived to find Granger, an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers, suffering serious injuries after a parachuting accident.

Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m. Perris Valley Skydiving general manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld told the Press Enterprise the man was coming in for a landing when he made a turn at low altitude. Such turns increase a jumper's speed and are prohibited below 300 feet at that drop zone for that reason, Brodsky-Chenfeld said. He said he didn't know Granger's elevation when he turned, but it was very low. Injuries: Granger, pictured left and right, was an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers . Sad: Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m. 'We're not sure why he made that turn,' Brodsky-Chenfeld told the newspaper. He added that the cause of the crash had nothing to do with equipment failure, weather conditions or collisions. The man was jumping by himself, not with the military, and was not training any other jumpers at the time, he said. Brodsky-Chenfeld said he had brought a family member to Perris Valley on Friday but in the fatal fall hew as jumping alone. Army man: Granger, pictured with his sons, was jumping by himself, not with the military, and was not training any other jumpers at the time, he said .

The man's identity and further details on the accident were released Saturday. There have been at least 15 deaths at the Perris Valley Airport skydiving facility in the past 13 years, according to the Press-Enterprise.

Next door neighbour Alfred Downie, 85, said: 'She had an operation for a . hole in the heart a few years ago and was taking heart tablets. 'So you don't know if that was connected at all. She was such a pleasant woman and will be sadly missed in the area. It's an absolute tragedy.' Other . residents in the picturesque village paid tribute and described Dr Pope . as a lovely, cheerful and popular member of the community. One friend, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was a member of the choir at All Saints Church in Claverley with Dr Pope. He . said: 'I knew her primarily from attending the church and from the . choir which she was a member of. I knew her as long as she had lived in . the village. She was always cheerful and was a lovely young lady, well known by everyone.' Another . neighbour said Dr Pope had lived in the village with her husband for . about four years and they were a very private couple. Dr Pope worked at the Three Villages practice in Amblecote and Wollaston, near Stourbridge . She . added: 'The whole business is very sad. They were a private couple who . went about their own business. They didn't have any children but they . were very happy together and active. 'Everybody . knows that doctors make the worst patients and we just wonder what . might have happened if she had just gone for that check up. 'You never know it could have showed up something on a scan which might have saved her life.' Speaking in a . promotional video for the NHS Group she spoke about her love of being a . GP for the last nine years after qualifying from medical school in 1999. Colleagues at the practice . were too upset to talk about her sudden passing but said in a . statement: 'Her commitment and enthusiasm for the practice, patients and . her wider professional interests was infectious. 'She . will be very sadly missed by her colleagues, patients and her many . friends. Our thoughts are with her family at this painful time as we all . try to come to terms with her untimely loss.' Dr . David Hegarty, chairman of Dudley Clinical Commissioning Group, said: . 'Our CCG and the GP community has suffered a terrible loss. 'Liz . not only showed tremendous commitment to her own patients and practice, . she gave the same commitment to improving the quality of care for . everyone in Dudley. 'She was a great friend and inspiration to those of us privileged enough to work with her. 'No words can adequately describe how much we will miss her.' Dr Pope spoke in a promotional video about how much she loved being a GP . West . Mercia Police said the cause of death has not yet been established but . that they were treating the incident as a fatal road traffic collision. Pc . Tim Lever, from Shrewsbury police, said: 'Police officers attended the . scene, along with the fire service who righted the car and paramedics . who assessed the woman. 'The woman appeared relatively uninjured and was collected from the scene by her partner. 'However . sadly, just two hours later, the ambulance service was called to their . home address following reports that she had died. 'Our . thoughts go out to the woman's family and we have assigned a family . liaison officer to help them at this difficult time. The male cyclist . was not injured in the crash.' A spokesman from West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'Two advanced paramedics in a response car attended the scene and assessed the patient, a woman, but she chose not to go to hospital. 'At around 11am on Wednesday, the trust received a further 999 call to reports of a woman in cardiac arrest at a property in Shropshire. 'An ambulance and a responder paramedic were sent to the scene where sadly a woman was confirmed dead.' The coroner for Shropshire has been informed and a post-mortem was carried out yesterday.

"One by one, they take their turn in front of the camera; flaunting a red shirt, striking a pose, striving for a smile which smacks of pride. Some are familiar, others are little more than rumours, but each comes with the personal endorsement of Brendan Rodgers, and their collective cost is stratospheric. When finally they are gathered together in one place, they will put on those red shirts and call themselves ‘Liverpool’. So let’s hear it for Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Lazar Markovic, Divock Origi, Emre Can, and, if terms can be settled, Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Liverpool's biggest summer signings . Summer arrival: Rickie Lambert left Southampton to join his boyhood club Liverpool after a brilliant season . Exodus: Luke Shaw, Glenn Lovren and Adam Lallana, pictured, have all left St Mary's in recent months . Now some of those names will be familiar. You may recall that Southampton enjoyed a rather successful season; so successful, in fact, that Rodgers decided to buy them. He may have missed out on one or two players, but in Lambert, Lallana and Lovren he purchased the heart and soul of a club which was embarrassingly eager to sell hearts, souls and practically anything else which could be converted into cash. Some of the others do not trip off the tongue. Emre Can, whose surname is destined to inspire a thousand predictable headlines, is a 20-year-old, bought from Bayer Leverkusen for £10 million. Markovic, also 20, cost £20m from Benfica, and Origi came from Lille for £10m. It would be unfair to suggest that his talents are not widely renowned, but the official Liverpool FC website is carrying a feature called ‘The Divock Origi Story’. It runs for 57 seconds. Potential: Divock Origi joined the Merseyside club after a couple of impressive showings at the World Cup . International: Origi, centre, helped Belgium advance to the last-16 of the tournament in Brazil . Still, Rodgers, their manager, believes that Can is ‘exciting’, Markovic is ‘really exciting’, while Origi has the potential to become ‘world-class’. In any case, in the moment that shirt is pulled over their heads, they will instantly become heirs to the legacy of Keegan, Hansen and St John, celebrated in song and in story, revered legends of the Kop. For they are Liverpool’s summer signings, the best that £100m can buy. Now, in a league which contains the two Manchester clubs, along with the likes of Chelsea and Spurs, it may seem unfair to concentrate on Liverpool’s spending. In a relatively short spell as a Premier League manager, Rodgers has espoused civilised principles and created teams who play with flair and invention. His methods have been admirably supported by fans and board alike. In a fairer world, the club might well be entering the new season as defending champions. So we can have no quarrel with Liverpool. Imminent buy: Alberto Moreno, of Sevilla, is said to be on the brink of completing a move to Anfield . Graceful: Brendan Rodgers has been effusive in his praise of Lazar Markovic, right, since he joined the club . No, it is the system which makes us uncomfortable. When Barcelona offered Liverpool £75m for Luis Suarez, Rodgers — if dear Luis will forgive the phrase — bit their hands off. But with that £75m burning a hole in their pockets, what did they decided to do? For instance, did they even briefly consider lowering admission prices to make Anfield more accessible to hard-pressed followers? Not at all. They did what every other club does. They spent it; further enriching a flock of wealthy young men, a gaggle of grasping owners, and a plague of parasitical agents. It all felt a touch knee-jerk, automatic, the kind of thing that long ago Pools winners used to do when the man from Littlewoods came knocking. I spend, therefore I am. Naturally, the chosen ones were at pains to declare their loyalty. Lovren described his move as ‘a dream come true’, while Lambert announced: ‘This means everything to me.’ Moreno and Manquillo have yet to effuse but Rodgers himself set the gold standard for gush when he referred to Lallana as ‘a great human being’. 'A great human being': The Liverpool boss has also spoken very highly of Adam Lallana, left . Join the club: Emre Can, a purchase from Bayer Leverkusen, controls the ball against Olympiacos . Of course, all managers feel obliged to hurl superlatives at their acquisitions, in the knowledge that they will be judged by the players they have bought. I daresay that Graeme Souness paid fulsome tribute to the silken touch of Neil ‘Razor’ Ruddock and Julian Dicks when he flourished Liverpool’s chequebook in that long-distant winter. But the description of Lallana seems a little excessive, even if you have just laid out £25m for his services. In the midst of all this conspicuous consumption, Jordan Henderson said something interesting. Interviewed on Liverpool’s pre-season tour of America, the England midfield player declared his determination to ‘carry on from last season. To keep learning from the people around me, keep getting better all the time’. Stuck in the middle: Jordan Henderson, one of Liverpool's stars last year, could find himself pushed out . Smiling now: Steven Gerrard led Liverpool to within a few points of the title last season . He added: ‘We can take a lot of confidence from last season because we played so much good football. We went on such a long, unbeaten run ... we were so close to winning the league.’ Indeed they were. Suarez was a huge factor, of course, but so too were names such as Gerrard, Sturridge, Sterling, Flanagan, Skrtel, Coutinho and Henderson himself. They now enter a new season knowing their manager thinks there was nothing much wrong last time that six or seven vastly expensive new players won’t fix in the months ahead. A gesture of faith in the old guard would have been certainly cheaper and possibly more effective. Incidentally, Brendan Rodgers is reported to be in the market for a new striker. Inevitably costly, hopefully a great human being. With perfect wrist action, subtle Moeen Ali made his point . When the Test was won and the series was squared, Moeen Ali found himself at the centre of attention. Six Indian wickets had secured him the spotlight, and while he did not relish the fuss, he fulfilled his duties with appealing grace. The noises off were fascinating. Andrew Strauss, having earlier described Moeen as a ‘part-time spin bowler’, was hurriedly reclassifying. The selectors were congratulating each other on their perspicacity and the English public was celebrating the pivotal part which Moeen had played in a rare and precious victory. Proving a point: England bowler Moeen Ali celebrates after taking the wicket of India batsman Virat Kholi . Moeen wore the air of a man enjoying a private joke, the way he had reacted three days earlier when the world was staring at his wrist. He knew precisely what convulsions he would cause by walking out to play for England while wearing wristbands which bore the slogans ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’. Steve Harmison, the former England bowler, announced that Moeen had been ‘a silly boy’ and patronisingly informed him that sport and politics do not mix. Some of us recalled the sentiment from the days of cricket’s apartheid tours and it was as fatuous then as it is now. More interestingly, the ECB declined to ban the bands, on the grounds that they were not a political slogan but a humanitarian statement and by the time the ICC eventually forbade the wearing of such adornments, Moeen had made his point and had tapped into the widespread sympathy for his cause. Match-winner: Ali holds up the match ball as he celebrates his fifth wicket, bowling out Mohammed Shami . The entire operation was conducted with the finesse of a diplomat and the fact that the wristbands were quietly set aside next day only enhanced the subtlety of his argument. Of course, there are those who may never be completely reconciled to the sight of a man with a beard as bushy as WG Grace representing England. Mercifully, their numbers are few and are swiftly diminishing. For the fact remains that, in the space of a single week, Moeen Ali has won a reputation which far outstrips his wicket-taking or run-making abilities. These are early days, but one suspects that before his career is done this formidable British Muslim may well emerge as one of the most significant figures in English sport.","Brendan Rodgers has signed Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Lazar Markovic, Divock Origi and Emre Can for Liverpool this summer .

"How would you feel if one day you awoke to find your Glaswegian, Home Counties or West Country tones inexplicably gone, with a French, Danish or even Indonesian accent in its place? 38-year-old Sarah Colwill doesn't have to wonder. On March 7, 2010, she woke up to discover that her customary Plymouth pronunciation had gone - replaced by Chinese enunciation. Sarah is one of the handful of people to be diagnosed with Foreign Accent Syndrome, a condition so rare there were just 61 confirmed cases between 1941 and 2012. Sarah Colwill woke up to find she had a Chinese accent in place of her normal West Country tones . So what is it like to live with a voice that is not your own? A new BBC documentary, The Woman Who Woke Up Chinese, aims to find some answers. The star of the show is Colwill herself, whose bizarre Chinese accent is completely at odds with her looks, background and experiences. After suffering a severe migraine, Colwill was rushed to hospital only for doctors to be left baffled after she developed a strong Chinese accent. 'It's just been such a horrible thing to go through,' she sobs in the opening scenes of the documentary. 'People automatically assume I'm foreign, for a start, then they like to try and work out where I might be from.' Sarah is seen getting her hair cut in a Plymouth salon, where the hairdresser asks where she's from and how long she has lived there. Sarah has struggled to cope with the fact that people regularly assume that she hails from abroad . Sarah's accent has left her struggling to be understood - and the butt of cruel jokes . It's all the more galling because Sarah has lived and worked in the city all her life. It's perhaps no surprise then, that since that fateful 2010 day, Sarah's focus has been almost entirely on getting her voice back. But with doctors and scientists equally mystified, it's been a struggle. There is one clue though - Sarah is a migraine sufferer. She gets them, she says, around 10 times a month and so far, medics have been unable to find anything that gets rid of them completely. This could be important, as one of the few things known about Foreign Accent Syndrome is that its linked to headaches and is thought to be a type of neurological brain damage. Fellow sufferer, Kay Russell, 52, who also appears in the documentary, suffered severe headaches for years before a particularly bad migraine left her with a French accent in place of her habitual Gloucestershire tones. 'Up until I met Kay, I thought I was the only person in the world that this happened to,' says Sarah, sadly. 'You feel so alone so when somebody pops up and says ""actually, I have it"", you feel better. You think ""they sound foreign and they have to deal with it in the same way as me""' One of the world's few experts in Foreign Accent Syndrome, Professor Nick Miller, adds: 'There are some common threads that run through their stories. There's a lot of frustration about ""why me?"" and ""why is nobody able to explain why this has happened to me?""' As yet, there is no cure for Foreign Accent Syndrome. Sufferers can have voice therapy but at present, little more can be done. That hasn't stopped Sarah from looking. 'You don't even know who you are anymore,' she says of the condition. 'It's like you're trapped inside yourself.' The Woman Who Woke Up Chinese, Tuesday at 10.35 on BBC1 .","Sarah Colwill, 38, gained a Chinese accent following a migraine .

"Jack Rodwell says he would guard against advising a young English player to sign for Manchester City and admits his move cost him a place at the World Cup. The 23-year-old is starting afresh with Sunderland this week having ended a frustrating two-year stay at the Etihad. Rodwell made just seven league starts for City following a £12million transfer from Everton and has revealed his mind was long since made up on quitting the club. Mistake? Jack Rodwell believes his move to Manchester City scuppered his chances at playing for England . And the midfielder says he would be cautious were an English prospect to seek his advice on moving to a club such as City. 'Personally, I would probably say don’t sign now,' said the £10m man. 'I’d say get as much football as you can, but you just never know - you could go there, do really well and be winning league titles and everything. 'I would never say “don’t sign”, I would just say weigh up your options and ask yourself if you want to be playing regularly.' Out of favour: The 23-year-old midfielder struggled to nail down a first team place under Manuel Pellegrini . Rodwell was rated as one of the best talents in the world at 16 years of age when he became Everton's youngest-ever European player. Three England caps followed but he hasn't appeared since the 2-2 draw with Brazil in Rio last summer. Rodwell is keen to stress that he was fit for 47 of City's 57 matches last season but simply was not selected by Manuel Pellegrini. And that, he argues, robbed him of the chance of a return to Brazil as part of Roy Hodgson's squad. Bad experince: Rodwell would advise young English players not to sign for Manchester City . 'If I’d been playing regularly for the last two years, I believe I probably would have been up there (as one of best players in the world),' he said. 'I certainly think I would have been playing at the World Cup. It’s just not worked out over the last two seasons and that’s why I am here (at Sunderland) now.' Rodwell had several options over the close-season but, after a meeting with Black Cats boss Gus Poyet, he was sold on Wearside. 'The manager just came across really well, he’s someone who has done it at the top level and he knows what the players need,' he went on. 'He’s obviously got good man-management skills, he said I’d be playing every week as well and that’s the main thing for me.'","Jack Rodwell admits he wouldn't advise a young English player to sign for Manchester City .

"In the squalid Jacksonville dogfighting kennel, a champion named Bulletproof Sam sat in a makeshift wooden cage, his teeth exposed from a missing snout. Nearby, an undercover agent with the sheriff's office met with Sam's breeder, a big-timer in the underground world of dogfighting named Willie Coleman, and made a deal that was caught on a hidden video camera. Coleman - whose puppies other breeders nationwide sought for their prized bloodlines - was charged with 17 felony counts associated with dogfighting after that 2012 sting, and faced possible prison time. A dog seized during the second-largest dog fighting bust in U.S. history sits in a pen at a kennel in Jacksonville, Fla. It seemed like a sure win for investigators, who have gone after dogfighting with greater interest ever since NFL star Michael Vick pleaded guilty in 2007 to bankrolling a dogfighting ring and other charges, eventually serving 18 months in prison. The three largest dogfighting busts in U.S. history have occurred since 2009. But despite being banned in all 50 states and the momentum generated by the Vick case, the ancient blood sport is thriving in the underground, with hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake on big matches, police detectives and prosecutors said. State laws still require no minimum mandatory jail time, so while arrests and convictions can be disruptive to dogfighting rings for a short while, the practice continues to flourish. ""Unfortunately, in our courts today, animal welfare is not given the attention and seriousness that it deserves,"" said Cyrus Zomorodian, the Jacksonville-based animal cruelty prosecutor who tried Coleman's case. ""We constantly fight for more court time, resources and attention."" In 2013, after a three-year investigation that included local police and the FBI, more than 15 people were arrested, 367 dogs seized, $500,000 in cash, firearms and drugs were seized in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas. It was the second-largest dogfighting bust U.S. history, known as the '367 case.' A few big federal busts like the 367 case that have occurred since Vick are rooting out some large fighting groups, the more investigators look for organized, professional level dogfighting, the more they're finding. NFL star Michael Vick pleaded guilty in 2007 to bankrolling a dogfighting ring and other charges, eventually serving 18 months in prison . 'This is a much bigger problem than people realize. Law enforcement is learning that there's an absurd amount of money involved,' said Officer Ivan Wick, a dogfighting investigator with the Milwaukee Police Department. Wick, who worked with the FBI in April on a dogfighting bust that netted 12 suspects in Milwaukee, said investigations focused on a criminal group's dogfighting business can be more useful to detectives than following drug money. 'The criminal organization (in Milwaukee) was making more money from the dogfighting part of gang activities than from the drug trafficking part,' Wick said. Authorities say dogfighting isn't a regional phenomenon: arrest data collected by The Humane Society of the U.S. since 2011 show hundreds of busts ranging from San Francisco to New York City, and in nearly every state. ""People believe it's happening in someone else's community,"" said Tim Rickey, of the ASPCA, who worked with law enforcement on the 367 bust. ""There's not one kind of neighborhood or type of individual ... we've seen judges, a doctor, lawyers, nurses and firefighters all being involved in this."" Still, when there are arrests, prosecutors are often hamstrung by outdated laws once a case gets to the courts. In Florida, where dogfighting arrests are routine, there is no minimum mandatory sentence for conviction. The state's animal welfare law was written to protect livestock, so prison time is mandatory for the felony abuse of a horse or a cow, but not a dog. Animal cruelty legal experts say the same is true in states throughout the nation, but note that there is progress in toughening laws. In Florida, where dogfighting arrests are routine, there is no minimum mandatory sentence for conviction . For example, New York's animal protection laws are more than a century old, and also focus on the treatment of livestock, said Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice. Rice, who heads the state's district attorneys association, is advocating for a new law in Albany that would bring cruelty laws up to date and strengthen penalties. 'Prosecutors and the courts are hamstrung by laws that aren't just out of date but that don't treat crimes against animals like the serious crimes that they are. Not only does animal crime law in New York have little to no sentencing requirements, but it doesn't even allow the courts to count prior convictions in sentencing, essentially giving a free pass to repeat offenders,' Rice said. Laws are slowly changing in other states to make prosecuting these cases easier, said Lora Dunn, a staff attorney at the Animal Legal Defense Fund in Portland, Oregon. Seven states have added dogfighting to racketeering laws since Michael Vick's case in 2007, and in 2013 the federal government added a law to the Farm Bill that made attending a dogfight illegal. Florida prosecutor Zomorodian wants increased penalties for animal fighting to help bring more successful cases, but says either way, the cases will always be difficult. Even though Coleman, the dog breeder who faced 17 counts, and was well-known by advocates and dogfighters alike, he received no time behind bars. His case was delayed for two years until August, when a judge taking into account Coleman's advanced age - he's now in his 70s - and lack of a significant prior record sentenced him to probation and set him free. 'Our victims don't have a voice and cannot testify as to what happened,' Zomorodian said.","NFL star  Vick pleaded guilty in 2007 to bankrolling a dogfighting ring and other charges, eventually serving 18 months in prison .

"Darren Wilson is leaving the Ferguson Police Department, his attorneys confirmed just two days after it was announced the 28-year-old cop would not face trial in the shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown. When Wilson gave his first TV interview on Tuesday, he said it was unlikely he would return to his job  but still hadn't made a final decision at the time. One day later, it seems his mind was made up. 'It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,' attorney Neil Bruntrager told CNN, saying Wilson is currently negotiating his resignation from the Missouri police department. 'Realistically, he can't go back to being a police officer. He knows that. There's no illusion about any of this. But it's the way in which he leaves ... that's important to him on different levels,' Bruntrager added. Scroll down for video . Out of the job: Two of Darren Wilson's attorneys, Greg Kloeppel (left) and Neil Bruntrager (right), appeared on CNN Wednesday night and confirmed that the Ferguson police officer is resigning from the department . Mr Bruntrager also revealed that Wilson found out that his home address was circulating online while he was mowing his lawn. He said within three hours he had gathered his belongings and gone into hiding leaving his grass only 'half mowed'. Wilson's legal team also spoke about the tough decision for him to go into hiding and contemplate quitting the police force in an interview with the Washington Post. In the interview, the four-person legal team who specialize in representing law enforcement officers, say it took Wilson a long time to realize it would be too dangerous to return to his job, either in Ferguson or anywhere else. He has been on paid administrative leave ever since the incident, continuing to receive his $45,300 salary. 'I think I expressed to him, ""Do you realize your first call [back on the job] will be to a blind alley where you’re executed?""' attorney James Towey recalls. 'He took a pause for a minute, thought about it and said, ""Oh."" That is the reality.' Wilson talked about some of the dangers he would face and bring to his co-workers if he returned, in his first and only TV interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. 'Do you really think it's possible?' Wilson asked. 'Do you think they would accept me? Do you think it would be safe for me? Those are all questions, not only for me but other officers. Is attention brought to me going to hurt one of them? Can I put them in that situation?' The shooter: Darren Wilson's attorneys also spoke out about what it was like to represent the cop the last three and a half while he was under investigation in the shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. Wilson pictured above (left) in his first television interview, which aired Tuesday . Tragic: The 28-year-old cop shot dead Brown at the end of a 90-second encounter with the teen last August 9. His attorneys say witness accounts of the event were 'total bull'. The crime scene pictured above . In the Washington Post article, Wilson's legal team went on to call witness accounts of the shooting 'total bull' while describing how they've shielded their client during the more than three-month grand jury investigation. They said that Wilson was forced to keep a low profile and would spend time in dark theaters watching movies to avoid detection. While they said Wilson had become the 'poster child for bad race relations' his lawyers were confident that they had the upper hand throughout the grand jury process, thanks to conflicting witness reports. But it was also those first accounts of the shooting that  painted their client in the most negative light, and what turned the incident in the predominantly-black community of Ferguson, Missouri into a national issue. Right after Brown was shot on August 9, the friend who was with the teenager at the time told reporters about how they were minding their own business when Wilson drove up and started harassing them, even pulling Brown by the collar. Friend Dorian Johnson said his friend tried running away, and was turning around with his hands raised in surrender when Wilson fired the fatal shots. Towey calls this account 'total bull' and that Brown's blood trail actually showed he may have been charging towards Wilson right before he was killed. Meanwhile, they say their legal defense was beefed up by Wilson's consistent account of the events, which they claim have not changed since right after the shooting to his first and only TV interview on ABC two days ago. One side of the story: Wilson's attorneys were especially unconvinced by Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who has always said that the teen was raising his hands in surrender when Wilson fired the fatal shots. Johnson pictured on the right with his own attorney . Surrender: Johnson's account has turned into somewhat of a rally call for those outraged by Brown's death. At protests after the grand jury decision was announced Monday night, demonstrators marched with their hands up, chanting 'Hands up, don't shoot' and 'No justice, no peace' 'Everybody says that [his story] was so rehearsed and he was so prepped,' attorney Danielle Thompson said of the ABC interview. 'But the way Darren tells the story has not changed from the minute the shooting occurred. He could probably tell it in his sleep if he had to.' Just married: Wilson's lawyers also explained how they shielded him from the public during the grand jury process. They say he rarely went out and when he did he would wear 'disguises'. One rare occasion he left the house was in October, to get a marriage license (pictured above) Wilson's lawyers also went on to describe how they have protected his privacy during the grand jury process, especially after his home address was published in news reports just 10 days after the shooting. From there, Wilson spent a week living with one of his attorneys, Greg Kloeppel, before his legal team found him a 'quote-unquote permanent' residence. They say he hasn't been back to his house since. Wilson's lawyers say they made the decision early on to keep their client out of the public eye -  quite a difference from George Zimmerman, the Florida man who was acquitted on charges of shooting dead 17-year-old Trayvon Martin two years ago, sparking similar outrage on race relations. '[Zimmerman] is an idiot, Darren was not,' Towey said. 'Any criminal defense lawyer that has half a brain says, ""Shut up, don’t say a word.""' Only a few pictures emerged of Wilson during the three and a half months he was under investigation, but he still took great care not to be recognized on the rare occasions he would go out in public - like when he recently obtained a marriage license in Clayton, Missouri for his wedding last month to fellow police officer Barbara Spradling, 37. Attorney Neil Bruntrager says Wilson used 'certain [disguise] tricks' picked up in police training to avoid attention. 'He cross-dressed a lot,' Brutrager joked. They also say he went to the movies a lot, since the darkness provided privacy. 'You have to take precautions, where you sit in a restaurant and where you drive,' Wilson elaborated to ABC. 'You have to make sure no one is following you.' Outrage: The grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson on any charges in Brown's death led to violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri Monday night. The massive demonstration means Wilson will likely have to continue living a very private life . What next? It's still unclear what Wilson and his wife will do once he leaves the Ferguson police department. Above, protesters ransack a police cruiser Monday night . The continued violence in Ferguson, the fact that his face has been broadcast on all major networks for the past four months, and an ongoing federal investigation mean Wilson will likely have to continue living like a recluse. It's also uncertain what will happen to his wife, who is also a police officer in Ferguson, since her picture and name have been reported. That question will likely be answered later, as it was revealed Wednesday that she is pregnant, and may already, or soon will be, on maternity leave. One option that has been discussed  is Wilson being put in witness protection, but the cop wouldn't qualify for the program unless he was indicted on federal charges and made to testify in court. Money is also a concern, once he is released from the Ferguson Police Department.  Supporters raised some $500,000 to help him pay his legal bills and other costs on two GoFundMe pages before the accounts were shut down. It's unclear though whether Wilson would be able to spend the money or need to put it towards defending himself in a possible civil suit from Brown's family. In their Washington Post interview, Wilson's lawyers explained why the police officer has not made a  public apology to the Brown family. 'Even if he gave the most heartfelt apology, they’d still not like it,' Towey said. 'Taking a life is a horrible thing to have to do,' Bruntrager said. 'And yet, the key phrase is, ""to have to do."" Because that is what he thinks. Is that going to make the Browns feel any less grief?' Won't say sorry: Wilson's attorneys also explained why he hasn't issued a public apology to Michael Brown's family (Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden pictured above in the white beanie and blue shirt, after hearing the grand jury decision), saying they would never accept anything he has to say .","The Ferguson, Missouri cop's legal attorneys said he is currently negotiating his resignation from the police department .

"Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford says he has yet to decide who will be selected for this year’s Tour de France despite Bradley Wiggins’s claims that defending champion Chris Froome will be chosen ahead of him. Wiggins, the 34-year-old quadruple Olympic gold medallist who became the first Briton to win the Tour in 2012, said on Friday the team would concentrate on delivering Kenyan-born Froome a second consecutive title. But with the Tour due to start in Britain on July 5, Brailsford told the Sunday Times newspaper that he would pick his nine-man team after this month’s Criterium du Dauphine. Froome, meanwhile, geared up for the Tour de France by winning the first stage of the Criterium du Dauphine. Scroll down for video...

'Despite the impression that might have been created, the team for the Tour is not yet finalised,” Brailsford said. 'I will be the one making the decision on who is in the team. I speak with our performance team, the riders can offer an opinion but they don’t select the team and they never will.' With Froome selected to ride in the Dauphine, the traditional warm-up ahead of the Tour, Brailsford admitted the 29-year-old is in pole position to lead the team across France. Front runner: Chris Froome is in pole position after racing in the traditional warm-up Criterium du Dauphine . But Brailsford dispelled suggestions that Froome would have the final say on the selection of the team, especially given the fractious relationship between the two riders after Froome helped Wiggins win the 2012 Tour. 'Trust and harmony are important considerations and it is a difficult decision,” he added. “I’m not just talking about the harmony between Chris and Brad but harmony amongst the riders and staff. 'People should be careful before thinking Chris is making decisions here. Chris is a great bike rider, he deserves to lead our team but ultimately he doesn’t pick the team.

"Facing trial: Shrien Dewani arrives at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court to hear he can be extradited to South Africa to stand trial for his wife's murder . Shrien Dewani, the British man accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon in South Africa, is likely to stand trial after a judge gave the go-ahead for his extradition. The millionaire Bristol businessman, 31, is accused of organising a car-jacking and shooting which left wife Anni, 28, dead in a Cape Town taxi last November. Dewani denies any involvement in the killing and had fought extradition proceedings, arguing that he is suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder and is too unwell to be extradited. His lawyers had claimed he was mentally ill and that extradition to face trial would be a violation of his human rights. But District Judge Howard Riddle ruled he can be sent to stand trial in South Africa although the final decision will rest with Home Secretary Theresa May. He said: 'The court must consider the strong public interest in honouring our extradition treaty'. Judge Riddle added he had 'no doubt' that Dewani is suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and is at high risk of suicide or self-harm. But he said he was satisfied he would receive the appropriate levels of mental health care at the hands of the South African authorities. Result: Anni Dewani's parents Vinod and Nilam Hindocha arrive at Woolwich Crown Court . He took more than two hours to read . out his judgment at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court in south east London, . beginning with evidence relating to the serious problems with . overcrowding, violence and sexual violence in South African jails. Murdered: Anni Dewani was killed on the second night of her honeymoon in Cape Town . He . said Dewani, whom he described as 'good-looking, youthful and . physically well-preserved', would be particularly vulnerable to sexual . abuse. He said: 'There has been some suggestion that he may be gay.' But although many South African prisons are ill-equipped to deal with the mentally ill and inmates are at high risk of contracting HIV or Aids, the judge said he was satisfied that Dewani would be held in one with a good level of facilities and be kept in a single cell. Wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and black . trousers, bearded Dewani sat in the dock and stared straight ahead at . the judge throughout the hearing. Members of his family were also in court. On February 20, Dewani, who has been staying at Fromeside Clinic, a secure mental health hospital in Bristol, was admitted to Bristol Royal Infirmary after taking an overdose, and was heard to have said 'I don't want to live'. The judge said he accepted psychiatric evidence that Dewani remains at high risk of suicide but added: 'I'm satisfied that authorities are alert to the possibility and will take appropriate steps to prevent that risk.' He added that Dewani is 'highly intelligent, an advantage not shared by many criminals in courts' and had shown awareness of developments in the country. 'He added: 'I have complete confidence in the South African system of justice.' The extradition proceedings began in May but were adjourned while a psychiatric report was completed. Shrien and Anni Dewani were ambushed by . car-jackers as they drove through a dangerous South African township. initially it appeared to be a random attack.

"England are set to name an unchanged XI in Thursday's fourth Investec Test against India in Manchester after squaring the series in Southampton last week. Barring a late change of plan, that will mean no instant return for Middlesex fast bowler Steven Finn, who was added to the 13-man squad in place on the injured Liam Plunkett and has been talked up by England in the build-up to this game. Sportsmail understands that the England selectors are not willing to tinker with a winning team, which means a reprieve for Chris Jordan, the Sussex seamer who struggled with his rhythm at the Ageas Bowl and whose five Test wickets have so far cost 70 apiece.

The news will have come as a disappointment to Finn, who is said to be back to something approaching his best after being deemed unselectable by England ever since returning early from the disastrous Ashes tour last winter. He has picked up 44 Division One wickets in the County Championship this season at 29 apiece, and England selector Angus Fraser suggested on Sunday that the ‘time was right’ for him to rejoin the international fray. Asked about the possibility about of making a change for this side, Alastair Cook said: ‘We hadn’t won for 10 games. You always try to pick your best team, but you balance that with continuity. Guys in that team don’t want to be keep looking over shoulder – I’m in and I’m out. You make calls like that, but successful sides built on a bit more stability than that.’ Old Trafford is expected to offer more bounce than any surface England have encountered this summer, leading to speculation that the 6ft 7in Finn was set to make his return. The onus could now fall on England’s next-tallest bowler, Stuart Broad, to make an impact. India, meanwhile, could make three changes to the team who put up so little resistance at Southampton. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin could play his first game of the series, in place of batsman Rohit Sharma, while fast bowler Varun Aaron is in the mix, possibly at the expense of the luckless Pankaj Singh. India could go for experience at the top of the order, too, where Gautam Gambhir might replace Shikhar Dhawan.

"The books are so old that the only safe way to clean them is with a vacuum cleaner. So each volume in the 40,000-strong library at Longleat House has to be taken down from the shelves and thoroughly dusted down in a process that can take anything up to 15 minutes per book – and years for the whole collection. But staff at the Marquess of Bath’s home in Wiltshire aren’t using the family Dyson for this spring clean. Careful clean: A team of workers with mini-vacuums are cleaning the 40,000 books accumulated over 500 years in the 7 libraries of Longleat House in Wiltshire . They’ve been given small hand vacuums that are delicate enough not to damage the books – some of which date back 500 years. The entire process takes years to complete and so staff at Longleat House near Warminster, have divided it up into sections. They started by slowly sucking the dust from the pages of the 4,500 books in the Green Library and have now moved on to the Ante Library, where there are 3,000 books. Each one takes between three and five minutes to clean depending on age, size, and how delicate it is. The group is focusing on the shelves nearest to the visitors’ areas because crowds walking past have created more dust. Arduous task: It takes two teams of four staff 3-15 minutes to delicately hoover the dust from each book using specially adapted low suction vacuum cleaners . The first library at Longleat dates back to the 16th century when the house was built by Sir John Thynne and some of his books still feature in the enormous collection. The oldest tome at the house dates back to 1470 and there around around 130 others printed before 1500. Other fascinating books include Shakespeare’s First Folio and the earliest English cookbook, the ‘Book of Cookery’ printed by Pynson in 1500. Matthew Baalham, assistant librarian said: ‘We concentrate on the books which are closest to where visitors walk as this creates more dust. Slow progress: Staff started with the 4,500 books in the Green Library and have now moved on to the Ante Library, where there are 3,000 books . ‘We use special, low-suction vacuum cleaners and it takes between three and fifteen minutes to clean each book depending on age, size and how delicate it is. ‘Some exceptionally large and dirty books take longer. ‘I’d say the key requirements are concentration, attention to detail, and diligence, as well as knowing how to clean the books in a particular way. ‘The main feature of the vacuum cleaners is that they have sensitive suction levels, if they were any stronger the books could be damaged. ‘They also have the technology to stop any mildew spores that are sucked into the vacuum from getting back out and spread around.’","Staff at the home of Marquess of Bath to vacuum 40,000 books .

"Rory McIlroy (-15) Sergio Garcia (-13) Marc Leishman (-12) Charl Schwartzel, Patrick Reed, Keegan Bradley, Justin Rose (-9) Who can stop the awesome Rory McIlroy? Another week, another victory for the Open Champion who now has the Claret Jug in one hand and his first World Golf Championship title in the other after catching Sergio Garcia to win the Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday. Just to put the tin lid on another glorious Sunday for the Northern Irishman, he also reclaimed world No 1 spot for the first time since March last year. The 25-year-old looks so good right now it might be some time before anyone gets a look-in again. VIDEO Scroll down to watch highlights & Colin Montgomerie: Rory McIlroy is world class . Eyes on the prize: Rory McIlroy has won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and in turn becomes world No 1 . This is coming with me! McIlroy was all smiles after being presented with the huge PGA trophy . Just pipped! McIlroy successfully chased down Spaniard Sergio Garcia during the final day . Hats off: The 25-year-old salutes the crowd as he walked to the 18th green to seal the trophy . Cheered on: McIlroy is watched by supporters at the Firestone Country Club on Sunday afternoon . Chip and charge! The Northern Irishman shot a final round 66 to claim a second victory in under a month . Punching the air: McIlroy celebrates calmly after sinking the final putt to seal his world No 1 spot . Sequels don’t normally live up to the promise of the original but there were no complaints from the thousands of enthralled spectators who turned up to watch Rory versus Sergio, part two. The first instalment was at Hoylake two weeks ago, of course, where McIlroy held off a charging Sergio Garcia on the final day. This time it was Rory who had to do the chasing. A fast start was desirable and McIlroy duly obliged with birdies on each of the first three holes. With Garcia bogeying the third, a three stroke deficit had become a one stroke advantage. Garcia’s bogey had come about following a wayward drive that struck a woman on the hand with such force it knocked the diamond out of her ring. Thankfully it was found after an increasingly frantic search. Would Garcia find his previously impeccable golf game? Credit the Spaniard. He fell two behind following another McIlroy birdie at the 5th but stuck to his task to such an extent they were level once more by the turn after a rare McIlroy bogey at the 8th was followed by a Garcia birdie at the 9th. Keeping pace with McIlroy these days though is akin to holding off Tiger Woods at his best. Once he got his nose in front again at the 11th, the closing holes took on the flavour of the inevitable. The pressure McIlroy was exerting told on Garcia as he bogeyed the 15th. The lead was two with just three holes to play. Garcia had a chance to halve the arrears at the 17th but his birdie putt from 10ft slipped by. McIlroy was home and dry, with the margin of victory proving the same as at The Open - two strokes. And so McIlroy had lived up to his promise on the eve of the event to keep his head down and build on the momentum of that Claret Jug success rather than enjoy it. For him to return to the top of the world rankings, he not only had to win but Scott had to finish outside the top five. For most of the round Scott was fourth or better but, just to confirm this was McIlroy’s day, he bogeyed three holes in a row from the 14th. VIDEO WGC-Bridgestone Invitational - Day 3 highlights . So close yet again! Garcia was hunted down by McIlroy and couldn't cling on to the lead . On his way: Tiger Woods had to retire from the competition after an old back injury flared up . It was hard not to feel for Garcia. The last time he was playing as consistently well as this it was Tiger Woods who was invariably snatching titles from his grasp. Now it is Tiger’s heir apparent. At least this time he isn’t consumed by feelings of jealousy or bitterness as he was back then. He might not like Tiger but his respect for McIlroy was obvious as the pair chatted away happily down the 18th fairway, and there was genuine warmth in his congratulatory handshake on the final green. Next up for McIlroy and Garcia is the season’s final major, the USPGA Championship this week, where McIlroy will try to emulate the feat of Lee Trevino in 1971, when he won two majors in the space of a month, with a Canadian Open victory sandwiched in between. Few would bet against him. In the battle to impress the Ryder Cup captains as the deadline for automatic qualifying draws ever nearer, top marks went to Americans Keegan Bradley and Patrick Reed. Showing good signs: American Keegan Bradley was again impressive ahead of the Ryder Cup this year . That's a little better! Lee Westwood made an eye-catching 63 as the Englishman rediscovered some form . Bradley was a star of the last match at Medinah and would have given US captain Tom Watson something to smile about at the end of a calamitous week by finishing tied fourth. Similarly Reed, who moved into the last automatic slot when Dustin Johnson announced his withdrawal from consideration for personal reasons earlier in the week. Reed responded with a flourish, with a final round 65 to finish alongside Bradley. Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood showed signs of coming back to form with their eye-catching rounds of 62 and 63 respectively but there was no big week for the likes of British quartet Jamie Donaldson, Stephen Gallacher, Luke Donald or Ian Poulter, who all finished well down the field.","Northern Irishman reclaims the world No 1 spot .

"The world's population will soar by four billion to reach 11 billion by 2100, suggests a new study. Using the latest statistical tools, researchers found that the number of humans on Earth is likely to reach 11 billion by the end of the century - around two billion higher than some previous estimates. The findings includes the most up-to-date estimates for future world population, as well as a new method for creating such estimates. Research carried out by Dr Rafferty from Washington University says the world's population will increase more than thought (stock image shown). This latest number is around two billion higher than previous estimates. The findings were published online by the journal Science . The study's corresponding author Dr Adrian Raftery, a professor of statistics and of sociology at the University of Washington, said: 'The consensus over the past 20 years or so was that world population, which is currently around seven billion, would go up to nine billion and level off or probably decline. 'We found there's a 70 per cent probability the world population will not stabilise this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the world's agenda, remains a very important issue.' The paper explains the most recent United Nations (UN) population data released in July. It is the first UN population report to use modern statistics, known as Bayesian statistics, that combines all available information to generate better predictions. Most of the anticipated growth is in Africa where population is projected to quadruple from around one billion today to four billion by the end of the century. There are about seven billion people living on our planet and this number is set to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, according to UN figures. This population explosion is largely attributed to better healthcare and farming practices, with some experts arguing that industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries was the tipping point that allowed more humans to thrive. However, one social scientist claims the human population explosion has its roots as far back as 2,000 years ago. Aaron Stutz, an associate professor of anthropology at Emory’s Oxford College in Georgia created a new model of demographic and archaeological data to show when humans thrived. In a paper published in the journal PLOS ONE, he claims that political and economic reforms helped to create more stable families, and therefore enabled more people to thrive. The main reason is that birth rates in sub-Saharan Africa have not dropped as fast as had been previously expected. There is an 80 per cent chance that the population in Africa at the end of the century will be between 3.5 and 5.1 billion people, according to the study. However, other regions of the world are projected to see less change. Asia, now 4.4 billion, is projected to peak at around five billion people in 2050 and then begin to decline. Populations in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean are projected to each stay below one billion. The study's first author Patrick Gerland, a demographer at the UN, said the figures largely support the 2013 UN projections, but add a new dimension. He said: 'Earlier projections were strictly based on scenarios, so there was no uncertainty. 'This work provides a more statistically driven assessment that allows us to quantify the predictions, and offer a confidence interval that could be useful in planning.' Most of the anticipated growth is in Africa (shown) where population is projected to quadruple from around one billion today to four billion 2100. However Asia, now 4.4 billion, is projected to peak at around five billion people in 2050 while North America, Europe and Latin America  are projected to each stay below one billion . World population projections are based mostly on two things: future life expectancy and fertility rates. Earlier techniques relied largely on expert opinion for how those trends were expected to change. The newer forecast instead uses statistical methods to combine government data and expert forecasts for such things as mortality rates, fertility rates and international migration. Earlier reports also represented uncertainty by using scenarios in which women would have 0.5 children more or less than the experts' forecast. However, Dr Raftery said that method generates too big a range. He said: 'In a given year and country the fertility rate might be half a child higher, but the probability that it would be half a child higher in all countries in all years in the future is very low.' The new method uses statistical models to narrow the range, finding an 80 per cent probability that the population in 2100 will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion. Dr Raftery added: 'This paper brings together the research from the past seven years, and also brings in recent data. 'We can answer questions about future population growth using standard principles of statistical inference, which has never really been done before.' He said rising population could act to exacerbate other world problems - such as climate change, infectious disease and poverty - while the two things that decrease fertility rates are more access to contraceptives and education of girls and women. The findings were published online by the journal Science.","Research carried out by Dr Rafferty from Washington University says the world's population will increase more than thought .

"It's the most famous tune on television, the bounding fanfare that joyfully announces: ‘The football is here.’ Treasured by millions up and down the country, it marks the start of many a fan’s Saturday night ritual. And it was all recorded in a north London basement. Ask even the most ardent non-football fan to hum the theme tune to Match of the Day and they will probably be able to give it a good go. Firmly a part of British culture, Barry Stoller’s classic composition has been integral to the programme since 1970. Now, 44 years after its debut, Stoller has been talking for the first time about how he composed the most recognised TV tune in Britain. Fanfare: Barry Stoller’s classic composition has been integral to Match of the Day since 1970 . Surrounded by music from an early age – as a four-year-old he memorised Tchaikovsky ballets from his parents’ record collection – it was the guitar that really got a 16-year-old Stoller started. Some early covers led to a chart single, ‘Chariot’, which reached number 26 in 1961, but orchestral composition was always the aim. ‘I was really interested in orchestral sounds and that’s where I wanted to be,’ says Stoller, who turns 73 this year. ‘I put together a home recording studio in the basement of my family home, probably one of the very first. ‘The majority of recordings were guitar and bass, but I wanted orchestral sounds. There were no samplers or synthesisers in those days but there was the clavioline, a little keyboard that could make the sound of trumpets, flutes, strings. So I started to build up the sound of an orchestra.’ It was this classical background that provided the foundations for the Match of the Day theme. After being introduced to the programme editor by his cousin, Stoller had his chance but, with no brief on what was required, he was left to find his own inspiration. ‘All they said was they wanted “something good!” I started thinking about the game itself but I didn’t see that as the way to find the theme. It needed something to focus on. Result: Stoller's brief for Match of the Day theme tune was to come up with 'something good' ‘In general I’m not really a sports-minded person, but I thought about the crowds, all the thousands and millions of people that go to matches. There’s excitement, there’s joy, there’s a euphoria in the air. It’s electrifying and I thought if I can catch that energy, that magic of the people, and get it into the music then that would be it. That’s what I wanted to do and somehow it got in there.’ ‘It was the very end of the song that I heard first. I was thinking about gladiators and sportsmen and I heard that as being played by trumpets. Then the melody came into my mind and I just had it.’ After being selected by the BBC from half a dozen entries, a professional orchestra was brought in to record a new version for television, but things did not quite go to plan. ‘The amazing thing about it was when you heard it perfectly played, it didn’t have the same magic as the original,’ says Stoller. ‘You wouldn’t believe it but these things happen.’ So it is the home-recorded demo, played by just three musicians in a London basement, which survives to this day. But that longevity still remains a mystery to its composer. ‘I’ve tried to think about why it’s so successful and you can’t really pin it down. In essence what makes it is the public. They’re the ones who have made it what it is, not me. It’s a very strange thing. ‘They have tried to do different arrangements but the people go crazy. Even Cardinal Hume, a big Newcastle fan, wanted it played at his funeral. That’s a hell of a thing that he should want that.’ But, despite its immense popularity, the theme did not lead to many musical opportunities for Stoller. ‘Its strange,’ he says, ‘I almost feel divorced from it. It was the major piece of my career but I’ve hardly had any other commissions at all. Sometimes I can’t relate to being part of it. I don’t perceive myself in any way important in that respect. ‘I’m hoping now that other things spin off it and I can let people hear what other music I’ve done. If it’s going to change my life, it’s going to be now. ‘I would never have thought it would last this long and it’s got to the point where I’ll have to think about leaving it something in my will! It reincarnates itself every time it gets played and it always sounds fresh. ‘I’m phenomenally grateful to the public. They’ve done something that’s never happened for me. They have given me an award in their recognition of it. What price can you put on that? ‘It’s my love and it’s like a child. It’s out there, it’s been places, it’s grown up and it’s still there.

"Delay: Paul Nelson died after an ambulance took two hours to reach his Norfolk home . A young chef died from a brain haemorrhage after an ambulance took two hours to reach his home. Paul Nelson, 26, collapsed in his bathroom in the village of Blakeney in Norfolk, after returning from a shift at a local hotel with a headache. Mr Nelson's parents watched as his condition deteriorated, culminating in him coughing up blood and collapsing on the bathroom floor. His father Sidney Nelson, 59, and stepmother Haylie Wardhaugh, 45, dialled 999 at 11.15pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 1am the next day - taking more than six times longer than targets dictate. By the time he arrived at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, nothing could be done to save Mr Nelson’s life. Following Mr Nelson's death, health minister Norman Lamb demanded a shake-up of paramedic response targets in rural areas. Mr Nelson's death comes four months after a coroner branded East of England Ambulance Service crews 'chaotic' after hearing that three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took more than three times longer than national targets dictate to reach her home in Thetford, Norfolk. Sidney Nelson, who is disabled and cared for by Miss Wardhaugh, said he was disgusted by the delay that led to his son's death. He . added: 'He was an otherwise healthy young man... He just came home one . night and it was obvious there was something seriously wrong.' Mr Nelson went on to say: 'We just wanted to get him to hospital as quickly as we could to get him the treatment he needed.' Paul Nelson's parents forced their way into the locked bathroom after becoming concerned and found him lying on the floor. Criticised: Paul Nelson's death comes four months after a coroner branded East of England Ambulance Service crews 'chaotic' following the death of three-month-old Bella Hellings . Distance: Paul Nelson's ambulance took two hours to travel from Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital to his home town of Blakeney . By the time Paul Nelson arrived at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, nothing could be done to save his life. Four . months ago the East of England Ambulance Trust was branded chaotic by a . coroner investigating the death of three-month-old Bella Hellings. Bella stopped breathing after suffering a fit at her home in Thetford, Norfolk and died before ambulance crews arrived. Coroner . William Armstrong branded the waiting time of 26 minutes - more than . three times longer than national targets dictate - ‘wholly . indefensible'. The inquest at Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how an emergency first response car struggled to find the new build house because its satnav was not up-to-date and 'there were too many blue doors'. An ambulance also diverted to the house following the emergency call at 11.09am on 3 March was delayed because it was low on fuel and stopped at a petrol station. Concluding, Mr Armstrong said: 'By anyone's standard this was a grave emergency - what happened here was a long, long way from the eight minute response target. A paramedic arrived at the house within 15 minutes of the call on November 14. But the family said the treatment he could offer was limited and the emergency worker contacted the East of England Ambulance Service control room three times to ask for an ambulance to come more quickly. After arriving at hospital, scans and tests were carried out but he soon stopped breathing. Mr Nelson said: 'It was obvious his condition was worse than they were letting on... the paramedic himself seemed quite angry and frustrated that it was taking so long. He added: 'By the time he went out of the door, I would say he was pretty much dead..I don’t know if they could have saved his life but two hours seems like a long time and you can’t help thinking that, had they acted quicker, he would still be alive today.' The ambulance service has not offered the family any explanation for the delay but has told them an investigation has been launched. Following Mr Nelson's death, North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb said he would urgently raise the issue of ambulance delays in rural areas. He described Mr Nelson's death as 'all too familiar' as ambulance trusts neglect rural areas in favour of 'easier' urban response times. Mr Lamb added: ‘I don't have a complete blueprint for the answer but I'm clear there is a massive risk that the current system is distorting clinical priorities and rural patients are suffering as a result’. Describing the different response times in urban and rural areas, Mr Lamb went on to say: ‘It seems that if they meet the target for the whole of the east of England, it satisfies the Government target but the danger is they focus on urban areas where they can easily hit the target and rural areas get neglected.’ Mr Nelson's death comes four months after a coroner branded East of England Ambulance Service crews 'chaotic' following the death three-month-old Bella Hellings. Distraught: Paul Nelson's parents forced their way into the locked bathroom after becoming concerned . An inquest heard that one vehicle got lost because 'there were too many blue doors' on Bella’s street in Thetford, Norfolk, while another stopped for petrol while answering a 999 call in March. In October, an inquest heard that Evelyn Heath, 93, from Attleborough, Norfolk, died from an irregular heartbeat in the back of an ambulance after the vehicle took more than four hours to reach her care home. A spokesman for the ambulance service refused to comment on an ongoing inquiry into Mr Nelson's death but clinical operations manager Duncan Moore wrote to the family acknowledging that it appeared to have been a 'serious incident'. The trust has recently appointed a new chief executive after criticism that response times in the East of England were among the worst in the country. Targets have been put in place for paramedics to reach the most urgent 999 calls within eight minutes and get a vehicle to patients within 19 minutes. Mr Nelson, who was a keen footballer, worked at the George Hotel in nearby Cley-next-the-Sea. Since his death his organs have been donated to four different people. Miss Wardhaugh said: 'He was a lovely bloke and he had so many friends. He would help anybody.'","Paul Nelson, 26, collapsed after suffering headache and coughing up blood .

"Having seen Real Madrid sign three of the most outstanding players from the last World Cup, some Barca fans could be forgiven for feeling their big rivals have stolen a march on them this summer. But the club have spent around £127million on transfers and sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has brought in six new faces doubling-up in positions where a club legend - Victor Valdes and Carles Puyol – needed replacing. The headlines have largely been written by Madrid but if Barca can get Thomas Vermaelen and Luis Suarez on the pitch and keep them there; ensure that signing two ‘first-choice’ keepers doesn’t mean war on the training ground; and squeeze the best out of Xavi (who has stayed) and Gerard Deulofeu (who has come back) then this could still be their strongest group since 2011. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez push a photographer out the way outside court . New boy: Andoni Zubizarreta (left) and vice president Jordi Mestre (right) pose with Thomas Vermaelen . Midfield maestro: Ivan Rakitic will strengthen Barca's midfield options after joining from Sevilla this summer . Thumbs up: Luis Suarez will be expected to provide goals when he returns from his biting ban . As a former Barcelona and Spain keeper Zubizarreta ought to have been the perfect man to pick a new keeper and there are few doubts over the quality of the Chilean Claudio Bravo signed from Real Sociedad and Marc-Andre ter Stegen brought in from Borussia Monchengladbach. Both are good with their feet as well as their hands, have experience in top leagues and, at 31 and 22, have years ahead of them – Stegen more than Bravo. The only doubt concerns the wisdom of buying two keepers of similar standing who will both want to play all the time. Madrid played Iker Casillas in the cups and Diego Lopez in the league last season but the former suffered from a lack of continuity and played poorly in the Champions League final. Defensively they have at least finally signed an out-an-out centre-back in Vermaelen. There are concerns about the ongoing injury problems that meant he joined the club and headed straight for the treatment room but if he gets fit and stays fit there is little doubt his intelligence, distribution and aerial ability will make him an asset. The slightly less physical demands of La Liga will suit a player for whom the 90-minute intensity of the Premier League was beginning to take its toll. Jeremy Mathieu will also reinforce Barça’s famously under-resourced defence. He has pace to burn and having started his career as a left-back he could play on the left of a back three should Luis Enrique go 3-4-3 this season. The Frenchman signed from Valencia will be 31 this October and Vermaelen will be 29 in November. But experience is what Barcelona need defensively as they wait to see how younger players such as Edgar Le and Frank Bagnack develop. Safe hands: Claudio Bravo makes an acrobatic save during a friendly defeat to Italian side Napoli . Experienced: Jeremy Mathieu (left) will take no time to adapt to La Liga after joining from Valencia . The big plus with Mathieu is that he does not need to adapt to a new league. And neither does Ivan Rakitic who joined from Sevilla aged 26 and has been impressive in pre-season. Taking set-pieces and releasing forwards with the passes that, as an occasional starter, Xavi will also still be able to provide. Rakitic was the outstanding midfielder in La Liga last season and it looks good business. Which just leaves the biggest piece of business Barcelona have done this summer – bringing in Luis Suarez for £75m. His current ban has supporters’ excitement on hold. But if the Court of Arbitration allows him to return to ‘football-related’ activity he will be presented at the Camp Nou and can begin to get acquainted with the other two thirds of what Barcelona hope will be an explosive front three to leave even Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo trio in the shade. Will it work? Suarez showed with his second goal against England in Sao Paulo at the World Cup what he can do running the right channel and Neymar is happy on the left. And both will get their chance to play more centrally when Messi drops deep so there is no reason why it won’t. When Messi doesn't play Suarez will play through the middle and Pedro will be given a chance to impress out wide. Suarez also brings an intensity that Barcelona have missed in the last three seasons and like Matheiu and Rakitic his career lacks silverware giving Barcelona back the desire they lost with a squad bloated by having won so much in such a short space of time. They have spent more than their rivals. And with Suarez banned, Vermaelen injured and Mathieu admitting to liking the occasional cigarette when he joined, and evidently neither Thiago Silva nor Mats Hummels, it would be easy to say they have not got their money’s worth. But when the squad is written down in black and white, it’s hard to see where the gaps are. Ter Stegen / Claudio Bravo . Alves / Montoya     Pique / Bartra    Vermaelen / Mathieu    Alba / Adriano .

"Stevie May is set to agree a move to Sheffield Wednesday after holding talks with the Hillsborough club and their Championship rivals Rotherham. Wednesday matched Rotherham’s £800,000 bid for the player in midweek and they appeared to have won the race for St Johnstone’s talismanic striker. The 21-year-old’s decision will delight Saints strike partner Steven MacLean, who enjoyed a happy stint with the Owls between 2004 and 2007 — and had already informed May that the chance to follow in his footsteps there is one he shouldn’t pass up. ‘Sheffield Wednesday would be a great move for Stevie, I’ve told him that,’ said MacLean. ‘The decision is his, of course, but I told him the fans there will love him. They love a goalscorer and a player who gives their all — he’s ideal for them. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Stevie May claims Nikica Jelavic is the best player he's faced' Wanted man: Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham have been pursuing the striker . Words of advice: Saints star Steven MacLean, right, encouraged Stevie to move to Sheffield Wednesday . ‘He’s a good kid, he wants to learn and he’ll score goals in that league. If he progresses the way he has, he’ll become a top player.’ The term ‘sleeping giant’ may be something of a cliche but MacLean believes May will be blown away by the sheer size of the Hillsborough outfit. ‘They get 20-odd thousand on a bad day, and over 30,000 on a decent day — the club’s just huge. ‘It’s a Premier League club playing in the Championship. Playing there was the best time of my career. We took over 40,000 to Cardiff for a League One play-off final. ‘The potential is massive, they need to get to the Premier League again and, once they do, it will take off.’ Saints boss Tommy Wright has already tied up a loan deal for former Liverpool youngster Adam Morgan but there will be a collective need to replace May’s goals. ‘The lads are going to be sad to see Stevie go,’ admitted MacLean ahead of tomorrow’s league opener at Ross County. ‘He’s a much better player than I ever was and I scored a few in the Championship in England, so he’ll do really well. Great potential: Stevie May should thrive in the Championship . ‘Nobody will pretend we’re not going to miss him because he’s been such a massive player for us. But it’ll be up to us to help Adam Morgan when he comes in and also spread goals around the team more.’ May netted his final Saints goal in Thursday’s 1-1 Europa League draw with Spartak Trnava in Slovakia. That creditable display was rendered futile by the preceding 2-1 home leg defeat, a performance that still irks Saints. ‘We were well in the game in Slovakia and if we’d played them first out there we would have won,’ said MacLean. ‘You can’t take your foot off the pedal in Europe because as soon as your standards dip then teams will punish you. ‘We salvaged a bit of pride in the second leg but we’ve beaten a really good Swiss side (Luzern) and came up short against a decent Slovakian team.’ Saints’ domestic season begins with a trip to Dingwall tomorrow, a test that requires rapid recovery. ‘People used to wonder why Celtic and Rangers struggled after playing in Europe but now we can see why,’ said MacLean. ‘It’s tough on your body, especially for the older players, but you have to just rest up and try to recover the best you can.’","21-year-old held talks with Owls and Championship rivals Rotherham .

"A huge increase in the number of rooms offered for tenants to share was reported today in London, as the capital's rental prices continue to rise. A 71 per cent rise in room share searches has been reported by website Spare Room over the past two years - with two in five flat-sharers spending more than half their salary on rent. Meanwhile Kangaroom, which helps people find a room in a house share, said 93,500 adverts were placed last year by people looking to share a bedroom - a rise of 48 per cent on the previous year. Cramped: A 71 per cent rise in room share searches has been reported by website Spare Room over the past two years (file picture) Spare Room director Matt Hutchinson said: ‘Few people would choose to share a room, but the harsh reality is that London's housing crisis means rents are becoming increasingly unaffordable. ‘The demise of the living room and other communal spaces is another implication of the housing crisis - one in six shared homes now has no living room, compared to one in ten three years ago.' An advert for one 'bright twin room' is being offered on the website in Maida Vale, west London, for an all-inclusive £259 a week - which is more than £1,100 per calendar month. Suggesting reasons for the room sharing rise, Mr Hutchinson told MailOnline: ‘We don’t create huge amounts of work in areas where we used to build houses - around manufacturing and coal mining. Pricey: An advert for one 'bright twin room' is being offered on Spare Room on this road (pictured) in Maida Vale, west London, for an all-inclusive £259 a week - which is more than £1,100 per calendar month . ‘The scale that we would have to build on to change the UK’s property market would be a scale we haven’t built on since the 1970s. That is going to take time as there’s a lot of complex planning. ‘We need to look at how we use existing housing stock better. Just in England there are just between 15million to 20million unoccupied bedrooms in owner-occupied properties.’ Bedroom shares now make up more than 10 per cent of the market, according to Kangaroom founder Jinder Sidhu. He told The Guardian: ‘While rent prices in general rose by 7.5 per cent in 2014, room-share prices have decreased by 12 per cent due to increased supply and denser living conditions.’ The average monthly rent in London, which includes bedsits and shared flats, is now £1,418 - which is up 12 per cent in a year, compared to the national average of £867, it emerged last week.

"A pregnant Craigslist prostitute was stabbed 18 times, including four times in the head, and had her jaw broken in three places before she died, an autopsy revealed. Jaymie Adams was found on January 7 and her husband Justin was later charged with two counts of first-degree murder for his wife and unborn child. The autopsy report, released on Tuesday after an eight-month delay, declared the 25-year-old's death a homicide. She was found by bikers wearing only a winter coat on the banks of Lake Stanley Draper, Oklahoma after disappearing last December. Scroll down for video . Grisly: Jaymie Adams, 25, was killed after being stabbed 18 times and had her body dumped by an Oklahoma lake. Her husband Justin (left) has been charged with his pregnant wife's murder . Justin Adams, 25, was charged with murder on February 13 before being released from jail on $100,000 bail. According to documents obtained by NewsOk, prosecutors asked for more time to prepare for the father-of-three's preliminary hearing. A court date has not yet been scheduled. Irven Box, lawyer for Adams, said he believed police were looking at another suspect. Police said the 25-year-old admitted lying about . circumstances surrounding his wife Jaymie's disappearance which he reported on December 9. He . initially told them she was meeting a friend, then said his wife worked . as an Internet prostitute and left to meet a client. Officers said Justin Adams didn't reveal that his wife had accused him of domestic violence. Mr Box said at the time of his client's arrest that he didn't see anything in the affidavit that tied his client to the killing. Investigation: The body of Jaymie Adams was found on a dirt bike track weeks after she was reported missing by her husband . Mother-of-three Mrs Adams reportedly advertised her sexual services on Craigslist and had gone to meet a . client the night she disappeared, her husband told police. A motorcyclist found her body along a . dirt track on January 7, although authorities believe it had been there for around 24 hours before being discovered. The . cars of Justin Adams and his mother Tina Clark were later seized by police looking for evidence. He . admitted he and his wife, who had been married since last February, were . 'swingers' and that she advertised on Craigslist as a 'massage . therapist'. Adam's arrest came after authorities gathered evidence from interviews, phone records, the internet and email accounts that were inconsistent with Adams' story. Oklahoma law states a suspect can be charged with two murders . if the victim is pregnant. Suspicious: Jaymie Adams, 25, told her husband of one year she was going to meet a 'friend' at this McDonalds, where police later found her van . Following Mrs Adams' disappearance, her husband made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely. He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother. 'My wife is a loving, strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife.

"Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has no doubt Leonardo Ulloa can handle the pressure of expectation. The Argentinian striker became the Foxes' record signing in July after scoring almost a goal every other game for Brighton last season. Ulloa has no Premier League experience but marked his debut with a well-taken goal as Leicester began life back in the top flight by drawing 2-2 against Everton at the King Power Stadium. Ulloa harried the Everton defence throughout, and Pearson said of the 28-year-old: 'I think he showed a lot of qualities. 'His strength and his work-rate will probably have surprised a few people. He's a real team player and I think our players have very quickly recognised his strengths. Goal: Leonardo Ulloa scored on his Premier League debut against Everton . 'When you become a club's record signing there is an added pressure that goes with that, but he handles that very well. 'The perception in terms of the value is probably measured differently externally to what I do. I'm very pleased for Leo because he is a focal point in terms of how we play, he's got a good goalscoring record and I'm pleased he's got off the mark.' Ulloa's goal cancelled out Aiden McGeady's opener less than two minutes after Everton had taken the lead. The Toffees went back ahead just before half-time through Steven Naismith but Leicester secured a point four minutes from time thanks to substitute Chris Wood. Wood's goal was made by midfielder Riyad Mahrez, whose trickery caught the eye throughout the match. Record: Leonardo Ulloa scored almost a goal every other game while at Brighton last season . The 23-year-old joined Leicester from Le Havre in January and his performances over the second half of last season earned him a spot in Algeria's World Cup squad. Pearson said: 'When you consider the progression he's had in the last 12 months, it would be very easy to ask too much of somebody like him. 'He's joined us as a relative unknown and been selected for Algeria in the World Cup and now finds himself playing in the Premier League. 'He's a talented boy, there's no doubt about that, but my job is to make sure I protect my players. 'I've got no doubt he can deliver in the Premier League but I also understand where he's at as a young man learning his trade. He's not going to be able to perform miracles week in, week out.' One frustration for Pearson was a hamstring injury picked up by Danny Drinkwater in the first half. Draw: Nigel Pearson's side earned a valuable draw with Roberto Martinez's Everton . The Leicester boss was already without new signings Marc Albrighton and Matthew Upson, striker Jamie Vardy and midfielder Matty James because of injury. 'It probably means we will try to add to the squad between now and the end of the window because the numbers game is important,' said Pearson, who is continuing to pursue former Argentina international Esteban Cambiasso. A shadow was cast over the start of Everton's season by a knee injury to key midfielder Ross Barkley. The club are still waiting to find out the extent of the damage but manager Roberto Martinez fears he could be missing for months. Transfer: At £8.75m, the Argentinian striker is Leicester's most expensive transfer ever . The Spaniard was content with how his side responded, bar the lapse of concentration that allowed Wood to earn Leicester a point. 'That's football,' said Martinez of Barkley's absence. 'You're going to get injuries, you're going to get suspensions and what we need to do is make sure we react as a team, and I think we did that. 'I thought Romelu Lukaku to play 90 minutes was phenomenal, he didn't have the right to play 90 minutes and he showed he's going to get fit very quickly, which is something we didn't expect. 'I think everyone contributed. Leighton Baines and Steven Pienaar showed flashes of their very best understanding, the control from Gareth Barry and James McCarthy was back to the level of last season, and Aiden McGeady is a fresh player.

"Alastair Cook will never have a better chance of scoring the century that eludes him but on another day of English domination the captain again fell short of the landmark that would complete his recovery from the darkest days of his career. When India shelled two dollies to reprieve Cook on the second day of the final Test it seemed certain the cricketing gods had decided The Kia Oval was a worthy stage for Cook to finally silence any remaining doubts about his form. VIDEO Scroll down for England's cricketers kept the pressure on India in the 5th test . So close: England captain Alastair Cook missed out on an elusive century despite two reprieves . He had, after all, received a huge let off on the first evening when Australian umpire Paul Reiffel decided that what looked a plumb lbw shout from Bhuvneshwar Kumar had pitched outside Cook’s leg stump. It had not. Then when Murali Vijay and Ajinkya Rahane dropped two of the easiest slip catches you will see when Cook was on 65 and 70 India were looking like an absolute rabble and the England captain was enjoying a charmed life. Yet, oddly, Cook became less fluent the longer his innings went on and by the time he pushed tentatively outside off-stump and was caught off the hardest of the three chances he offered he was again looking vulnerable to his old failings. Influential: England's Joe Root continued his rich vein for form by scoring a sparkling 92 . Cook would have taken three half centuries in four innings since he and England hit rock bottom at Lord’s but his failure to cash in when everything was going for him means the wait for his 26th Test century now extends to 31 knocks. With England‘s next Test not until next April, and with India’s frailties meaning Cook will probably not get another chance here, that long gap since he took New Zealand for 130 at Headingley last May will extend to nearly two years. The way England have turned this Investec series around means that the pressure has lifted on Cook dramatically but the perfectionist inside him would have wanted the icing on the cake that a century here would have represented. Threat: England's Jos Buttler takes evasive action during the second day of the fifth Test . Such has been England’s continuing mastery of a deflated India that it will represent only a minor irritant as long as they go on here to complete their third successive victory after a nightmare run of 10 Tests without a solitary win. That triumph could come as early as today if India once again bat as badly as they have done in Southampton, Old Trafford and now here but if it does MS Dhoni cannot really blame an attack that stuck resolutely to its task. When Cook and Gary Ballance had taken England to 191 for one after the early loss of Sam Robson, and with India’s catching in a state of disarray, the wheels of Dhoni’s touring bus were close to falling completely off. Got him: India's Varun Aaron celebrates bowling Sam Robson of England for 37 runs . Yet Vijay’s sharp pouching of Cook off the persevering Varun Aaron gave India an opening to at least reclaim bit of self-respect which they did by taking another three English wickets while only 38 more runs were being added. Ballance had looked certain to continue his Bradmanesque introduction to Test cricket by scoring his fourth hundred in only his eighth Test until he unexpectedly jabbed Ravi Ashwin to silly mid-off. Then when Ian Bell edged a beauty from Ishant Sharma behind and Moeen Ali found another sloppy way of getting out, this time deflecting an attempted leave into his stumps, England were under the slightest semblance of pressure. Head in hands: India's Varun Aaron shows his disappointment as Cook leads charmed life . Yet any hopes India had of keeping England’s lead down to manageable proportions were quickly snatched away from them by another classy contribution from the young player at the forefront of England’s new era. There has been much for England to be cheerful about this summer in the emergence of the likes of Ballance, Moeen, Jos Buttler and Chris Jordan but it is Joe Root who is developing into the flag carrier for all they hope to achieve. Ever since England moved Root to five in the order this year he has left his Australian problems behind him, looking much more assertive after beginning the Test summer with a double hundred against Sri Lanka. Here he once again impressed in tandem with Buttler, the pair reasserting England’s advantage with a stand of 80, and then when he opened his shoulders in extending England’s lead to a commanding 237 in company with Jordan. Root had always looked to be positive but as India flagged towards the end of a second day in which four overs were wasted after seven were left unbowed on Friday because of unacceptable over-rates he broke out into a near gallop. By the close Root had added 67 off 62 balls with Jordan and stands just eight short of his fifth Test century when he resumes today. Not only that but he has now scored at least a half century in every Test this series and has established himself as absolutely the heir apparent to Cook when the England captain eventually decides to call it a day. Thanks to the total transformation in this series that day will not now come for a while yet and England look certain to win this series 3-1. And that looked barely believable when they were bounced out by Ishant at Lord’s.","Root unbeaten on 92 and England captain Cook scored 79 .

"Derby are a team who struggle for goals but don’t concede any either - or so we were told. Both of those statistics vanished at the Valley, the latter of which largely thanks to the mistakes of their captain, Richard Keogh. It was his error that gifted Queens Park Rangers a place in the Premier League at Wembley in May, and the central defender suffered at Charlton, his mishaps offering the hosts three points on a plate. Keogh - at the bedrock of a back four to have kept three consecutive clean sheets before this - was caught a yard off George Tucudean for the first goal and brought down the same man for the second during a game which raised questions over Derby’s promotion credentials. Off the mark: George Tucudean (left) celebrates his first goal for Charlton with skipper Johnnie Jackson . The Rams were the pre-season smart money after the play-off final defeat But they have now endured an indifferent start, even with four points on the board. Steve McClaren had chosen to lament the fact his main men have been unable to find the net so far this season. Their league tally stood at one - Jeff Hendrick’s late winner against Rotherham on the opening day. A striking statistic, given this is the same side to have scored more than anyone else last season, even eventual champions Leicester City. The problem at Charlton was the disarray in which his back four was thrown with such ease. Keogh and Jake Buxton looked uncomfortable for large parts. Charlton: Pope, Gomez, Ben Haim, Bikey, Wiggins, Gudmundsson (Fox 89), Jackson, Buyens, Cousins (Wilson 65), Vetokele, Tucudean (Moussa 45) Subs not used: Phillips, Morrison, Harriott, Church . Scorers: Tucudean 11, Buyens (pen 45), Vetokele 78 . Derby: Grant, Christie, Keogh, Buxton, Forsyth, Ward, Hendrick (Best 77), Bryson, Hughes (Mascarell 45), Dawkins (Russell 69), Martin . Subs not used: Roos, Naylor, Eustace, Whitbread . Scorer: Ward 31, 85 . Ref: Michael Bull . Att: 15,317 . ‘You can’t win a game if you concede three goals like we did,’ McClaren said. ‘We reached such high levels last season that you expect to get back into the groove. That takes a while.’ It wasn’t ideal, therefore, that they came up against a rejuvenated and revamped Charlton here. For all the good groundwork laid by Chris Powell - sacked in March - this the Addicks are now a side insistent on playing a certain way under Bob Peeters. They play with width and want to entertain. ‘This is the best I’ve seen us play,’ the manager said. ‘Derby didn’t have an answer. We were passing the ball very well.’ It helps having someone of Johann Gudmundsson’s quality operating as a heartbeat. A roaming wide midfielder capable of going short and long when need-be, the Scandinavian cut is teeth at Chelsea and Fulham as a teenager. It was he, now 23 and formerly of AZ Alkmaar, who sprayed a clever ball wide to Jordan Cousins for the opening goal. Cousins set about attacking Cyrus Christie before crossing to Tucudean, who easily escaped Keogh, span and smashed beyond Lee Grant. Great effort: Jamie Ward (being lifted up) is over the moon with his spectacular equaliser, but Derby went onto lose . Gudmundsson had already gone close earlier, but Derby found themselves level. Martin stung the palms of Pope, Hendrick kept the attack alive on the byline before laying back - via a super Craig Bryson step-over - to Ward, whose arrowed effort into the top corner was breathtakingly unstoppable. Craig Bryson went close as well as Hendrick but full league debutant Nick Pope thwarted the pair. A head of steam was on its way, but they couldn’t compensate for another uncharacteristic Keogh gaffe, as he hauled Tucudean down in the box for Yoni Buyens to convert a second seconds prior to the break. Substitute Franck Moussa, who replaced the injured Tucudean, went close from Johnnie Jackson’s clever cutback. That mattered little, though, with the points seemingly wrapped up 12 minutes from time. As McClaren threw on targetman Leon Best, the impressive Igor Vetokele was left all alone in the six-yard box to calmly nod into an empty net from Laurie Wilson’s centre. Battle stations: Jackson takes on Derby midfielder Jeff Hendrick . Derby were offered a late lifeline they scarcely deserved after a dreadful Pope mistake - the goalkeeper allowing a tame Ward drive through his legs - but failed to capitalise on the obvious nerves swelling the ground. Peeters, who refused to criticise his young No 2, was buoyant - not quite as much as after the stoppage-time winner against Wigan at the weekend - and already has this club, dormant only a matter of months ago, dreaming of a season much more profitable than the last. Among the relegation favourites at the start of the month, Charlton remain unbeaten. ‘Never trust the bookies,’ Peeters smiled.","George Tucudean gave Charlton the lead with his first goal for the club .

"Prince Harry was no more  than 220 yards away when a US trooper standing aboard an armoured vehicle cocked a .50 calibre machine gun and fired successive bursts at Afghan shepherds tending their goats, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The shocking incident, which  was confirmed last night by the Ministry of Defence, triggered a war crimes investigation by US military police. It took place on Harry’s first frontline tour of Afghanistan, which, until today, has been shrouded  in secrecy. Sgt Deane Smith (top left) and prince Harry (centre) with the rest of the Household Cavalry troops . At the time Harry’s squadron from the Household Cavalry Regiment (HCR) were mounting joint patrols in Helmand province with a US Special Forces unit codenamed ‘Task Force 32’. According to a British eye- witness the three shepherds were peacefully minding their own business when they were engaged. Given the force of the heavy machine gun rounds it is likely  they suffered serious or fatal  injuries, though their bodies were never recovered. When the US trooper ceased  firing, Harry’s commander, Major Paul Bedford, marched over to where the American vehicles were parked and raised the concerns  of British soldiers who were  adamant that the engagement was entirely unjustified. Harry’s colleague Sergeant Deane Smith, 40, was so enraged that he recorded his reaction on a video camera, saying: ‘The Americans are fifty-caling [machine-gunning] goat herders and it’s disgraceful!’ Prince Harry directing a helicopter on his 2008 tour. he is described as having been incredibly brave during his time there . Sgt Smith then zoomed in on the armoured vehicle from where  the US trooper had launched  his attack. Sgt Smith, a commando engineer, has given the first graphic account of Harry’s front-line experiences and how the Prince dodged repeated Taliban ambushes. Harry’s first tour ended in February 2008 after an Australian magazine broke a media embargo over his presence in the war zone. Subsequent reports suggested Harry was treated as a VIP rather than just another junior officer while he was there. In fact, as this newspaper has established, he was pitched into the thick of the fighting. Sgt Smith has told The Mail on  Sunday how the day before Task Force 32 opened fire on the shepherds, Harry witnessed the deaths of young children when a Taliban rocket intended to strike his  vehicle missed its target and struck an Afghan family home. The US troop vehicles moments after the attack on the shepherds. British troops complained about the attack . Sgt Smith also described how Harry, . then just 23, displayed  a remarkable empathy for his  soldiers, some of . whom were overwhelmed by the horrors of war. He . said: ‘I’ll never forget the Yank opening up on the shepherds, which . was a completely unjustified attack and sadly typical of how the . campaign was conducted. But Harry had a way of reconciling everything he . saw and keeping his emotions in check, often when more experienced . soldiers were crying their eyes out. ‘On . the day of the rocket attack  on the family home, Harry was there, . comforting a soldier as the charred remains of young children were . removed. ‘He also arranged for the wounded to be transferred from the battlefield to a military hospital. ‘The dead were very young, their arms the width of two of my fingers. This was horrible to see. Prince Harry on a cigarette break after the battle of Musa Qala. he was furious when he was forced to leave . ‘In early 2008, I spent ten weeks in . Helmand with Harry and he was fearless throughout, even when armoured . cars were being blown up and he was being shot at. ‘Looking back, I can’t believe he was so keen to subject himself to such danger.’ Sgt . Smith added that Harry’s disregard for his safety unsettled his . soldiers, who would implore him to swap his favourite baseball cap for a . protective helmet whenever enemy rounds were fizzing overhead. Harry . also came within a single stride of setting off a live IED (improvised . explosive device), a brush with death he laughed off as he lit another . from an endless chain of cigarettes. Harry . was apparently critical of British tactics and complained when his . armoured column were ordered to retreat – at the time UK and US forces . were involved in Operation Snakebite, the battle to recapture the town . of Musa Qala in Helmand province from the Taliban. Prince Harry, pictured on patrol in Helmand Province in 2007-08, retrained as an Apache helicopter pilot . Sgt Smith recalled: ‘I vividly remember Harry and I driving outside Musa Qala – with enemy rockets air-bursting above us and rounds pinging off the armour-plating of our vehicles – when we were told to withdraw. ‘Harry was furious, shouting about how we’d never beat them if we didn’t attack their positions and eliminate them. ‘He couldn’t believe the appalling state of our vehicles either, they were always breaking down in  battle and the noxious gases given off by the fuel that leaked into the cabins used to make the drivers vomit.’ Sgt Smith was also with Harry when he was told he had to be withdrawn from Afghanistan. Major Bedford (centre) raised concrns about the attack. Pictured with Sgt Deane Smith and CoH Stevens . Sgt Smith said: ‘Harry was saying, “I can’t believe it, I can’t bloody believe it. I’ve been here so long I might as well stay, I really want to.” I asked why if the top brass were suddenly so concerned about Harry’s safety they couldn’t get a helicopter out to us to collect him. Apparently there were none available. There was a real squeeze on aircraft back then and all the choppers were designated for anti-ordnance teams that were defusing IEDs across the province. ‘So I was told to plan a route for us back to the district centre of Musa Qala, apparently he could get a helicopter from there. So the lives of 50 soldiers were put at risk to drive Harry through areas that were littered with enemy mines.’ When the vehicle column reached a narrow bridge over the Kariz Deh Baba wadi (riverbed), Sgt Smith scoured the ground  for explosive devices, finding  two bombs that could have killed the Prince. When the column reached Musa Qala, Harry bade his comrades a fond farewell and distributed his remaining sweets and cigarettes. Sgt Smith, who left the Army last week, now intends to write a  memoir about his experiences. Harry subsequently retrained as an Apache helicopter pilot – a much safer role according to Defence sources – and returned  to Afghanistan in 2012. The Ministry of Defence and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on details of Prince  Harry’s operational service. The US Defence Department has promised to publish the results of its criminal investigation and any disciplinary action taken against the Task Force 32 soldier involved in the incident with the shepherds. Harry's soldiers doubled over with laughter when the Prince attached a pair of girl’s knickers to the front of his armoured car in Afghanistan. The purple and yellow briefs, which Harry tied to the protective front grill of his Spartan vehicle, were apparently a present from a female friend. At the time, he had been dating Chelsy Davy for four years. Sergeant Smith said: ‘It was hilarious and great for morale. Harry showed a lighter side to his character and everyone enjoyed it, though he was coy about who had sent them. We bombarded him with questions but he held out under interrogation.’ Sgt Smith also recalled that Harry received through the British Forces Post Office (BFPO) a bottle of hair dye, with a note attached suggesting that he disguise himself from the Taliban. The Prince declined, maintaining his natural ginger hair colour even though he was engaging face-to-face with enemy suspects on a daily basis.","Harry witnesses a US trooper fire a machine gun at a group of shepherds .

"A two-legged stray dog has given birth to a litter of puppies in China - and all of their legs are in full working order. The stray, which was named Si Bao by an owner who later abandoned her, gave birth to four healthy puppies near Kouguan railway station in Datong, Shanxi Province in the north of the country. Shi Bao was made one of the city's many strays after her owner moved out of the neighbourhood and decided not to take her with him, but became well known locally when she lost her two rear legs after being hit by a speeding train two years ago. Balancing on just her forelegs, Shi Bao nuzzles her puppies lovingly as she takes them for a walk in the area around the train station. China has an estimated 130 million stray dogs - many them victims of a growing urbanisation that has seen millions of people move into high-rise buildings with little room for pets. It's a tough life on the street for many of the dogs. As well as state-sponsored extermination campaigns in many cities, there is also widespread abuse of strays by members of the public, and the risk of being captured for dog meat or succumbing to hunger and disease.

"When Rio Ferdinand completes his coaching badges, the former England defender has it all mapped out. He wants the biggest job of the lot. This is his England dream; a vision and a philosophy that he believes will get the best out of the country’s players under his guidance. It feels good to hear someone care so much. ‘Everyone has dreams of playing for England and my dream after football is to manage England,’ he revealed. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rio Ferdinand's factfile: His clubs and trophies . Dream: Rio Ferdinand, sat in the dugout while injured at the 2010 World Cup, wants to manage England one day . Making his point: Ferdinand spoke of his desire to 'put a few noses out of joint' at the FA . On his way: Ferdinand has started coaching and he is enthusiastic about his future in the dugout . Badge of honour: The former England defender wants all his qualifications before he starts coaching . ‘I don’t expect the chance now, but once I get the badges I am there. If I don’t get a job in management I will wonder why.’ Ferdinand started out on the coaching pathway when his career at Manchester United came to a close. It fills him with enthusiasm and now he wants more. To listen to him talk about the national team, to hear the passion in his voice, leaves you wanting to know more. ‘I will give myself the best opportunity of getting the job by getting all the badges,’ he added. ‘I don’t think people should start shouting the odds about the opportunity to manage clubs until they have their badges. I am not sitting here saying “give me a job” because I don’t have them yet.’ Fitting right in: Ferdinand with David Beckham and Sir Trevor Brooking on the bench in South Africa . He is on the UEFA B licence course and the next step is the A Licence and then the ProLicence. After that, he cannot be ignored. Ferdinand, who turns 36 in November, has too much to offer after a lifetime in the game. He has experienced almost everything. He admires the young coaches; the guys who were given a chance in their thirties. Ferdinand believes they have a better connection with the dressing room. ‘Low, Klinsmann were young geezers when they started out with Germany,’ he added. ‘Look at Van Basten, Mourinho, Guardiola and Luis Enrique — they are not old fellas but they were given a chance. It is different in this country. We are 10 years behind in certain situations. We have to do what’s best for English football.’ Ferdinand has the bug for it. He would be a tracksuit manager, taking England’s players through sessions as they prepare under a player who won 81 caps for his country during a distinguished international career. The old ones aren't always the best: A young Jose Mourinho sprints down the Old Trafford touchline in 2004 . He speaks of radical changes needed with the national set-up, adapting the structure to suit an England team that would be encouraged to play Ferdinand’s way. After 50 years of failure, it has to be worth a shot. ‘Maybe I’m not their (the FA’s) type, but I don’t know what their type is,’ added Ferdinand. ‘Maybe it’s an unblemished track record, but everybody deserves a second chance. Glenn Hoddle is a prime example. He’s the best one you had and he is gone, never to be seen again with England. We are on our knees.’ Ferdinand is talking about his eight-month ban from football after he missed a drugs test in 2003. It was an error, a bad one, but he has been the model professional ever since. ‘Everybody deserves a second chance,’ he says. Ferdinand is right. This is a man who wants to take care of his country, to improve the players and make sure the future of the national team is secure. It has been a long time since anyone could say that. ‘It will take radical changes for things to happen with England and people’s noses might be put out of joint but in the long run it will work,’ he added. Pepping them up: Pep Guardiola ushered in an era of success at Barcelona after being appointed aged 37 . ‘I am speaking from a position of wanting to help. When you are a young player, making your way, you don’t want to speak out because you are worried you might not get picked. But when you come out of the firing line, you can speak with experience.’ Ferdinand sat on FA chairman Greg Dyke’s commission, providing some compelling arguments about the state of English football when he sat down to discuss the future of the national team. ‘Bit left-field that one,’ is his reaction to a question about Roy Hodgson’s claim last week that there isn’t much difference in the way England and Germany try to play. He is reluctant to answer at first, unaware of the comments after he had only just come off QPR’s training pitch in west London as he prepared for the start of the Barclays Premier League season. ‘I watched the games at the World Cup and I didn’t see any likeness to Germany at all,’ he added. ‘We see sparks from Sturridge, sparks from Welbeck and from Rooney, but we play as individuals. They will not be able to fulfil their potential unless there is a structure and philosophy to aspire to.’ One day Ferdinand hopes to be able to put it all in place. Lowering the age: World Cup-winning coach Joachim Low was in his thirties when he became Germany boss in 2007, as was his predecessor Jurgen Klinsmann (left) He has the ideas, as well as the experience after playing career that took him to the very top. With his profile, along with his England career, the six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008, he will command instant respect in the dressing room. He fears that young players in the Premier League are earning too much, something Brendan Rodgers highlighted last week. ‘The incentive has gone,’ claimed Ferdinand. ‘Are you gong to do that extra set of doggies, or sprints? You can be in the reserves and if you have £5,000 a week coming in you’re thinking about what colour car you’re going to get. ‘Or you might be thinking what holiday you’re going to send your mum and dad on or what shoes you’re going to get. It is a different environment and I don’t think it is the right environment. It is football and if you are given a lot of scope then you will do it. That is the way it is. Maybe clubs or the FA have to revert back a little bit to give them a bit more of a grounding.’ Ferdinand is a traditionalist, one of the old school as he reflects on the days when he would sit on the bench alongside Frank Lampard as a teenager at West Ham. Back then they still cleaned the first-team players’ boots, keeping their head down and driving to training in beaten-up old Ford Fiestas at the start of their careers. The best: Ferdinand rates Glenn Hoddle (left), now QPR first-team coach, as his best England boss . ‘When I got on the bench at West Ham I thought it was an unbelievable achievement,’ he added. Me and Frank Lampard would sit there thinking, “Jesus”. ‘We would go out there to do the warm up and people think that’s nothing, but it is part of the experience and gets you accustomed to the surroundings. Now those players don’t get the chance. Managers won’t play a 17-year-old when they can play “Davide” or whoever, from wherever, because he has played 300 games and is 28 years old. That’s just my view, but who is right and who is wrong?’ Judging by this, Ferdinand has already got it all figured out.

"Hackers penetrated the Kremlin government's security system today breaking into premier Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter account to announce he was quitting. The incident sparked a rush of web humour directed by Russians against rulers seen by many as authoritarian but who are rarely criticised in the mainstream media. 'I'm resigning,' read Medvedev's Twitter feed. Hackers penetrated the Kremlin government's security system today breaking into premier Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter account to announce he was quitting . 'I'm resigning,' read Medvedev's microblog. 'Ashamed of the actions of the government. Excuse me' 'Ashamed of the actions of the government. Excuse me.' The ex-president's press service rushed out a statement that the announcement was a fake. 'The Tweet on his resignation is false. We're working on the problem.' President Vladimir Putin's press secretary had initially seemed less sure. 'I don't have any information, but I'm pretty sure that this was a hacker,' he said. The embarrassing security lapse came as Medvedev is due today to join Putin in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in March. The embarrassing security lapse came as Dmitry Medvedev  is due today to join Putin in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in March . The stream of fake Tweets attacked a speech by Putin in Yalta as well as Kremlin policies in general as the country is hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine. 'Do you think that in Yalta today will say something important? I doubt. Now sitting here and thinking - what the **** for?' 'Crimea isn't ours. Please retweet,' said one. Another said: 'We can return to the '80s. It is sad. If this the goal of my colleagues in the Kremlin, it is achieved.' Russian citizens 'should not suffer because of problems in the perception of common sense among the top leadership of the country', the tweets continued. Another using the name by which Putin would have been known as a child said: 'I wanted to say for a long time. Vova - you are not right!' Yet another criticised a regulation Medvedev signed into force which will require users to register, including providing their passport information, to use public Wi-Fi sites. 'Despite our initiative certain network hooligans don't give a damn about network access by passport.' His account was in the control of hackers for almost an hour before a flood of fake Tweets was halted and the offending comments deleted. The Tweets mirrored the language of a blast from minister Sergei Belyakov recently fired over his comments about the Kremlin's pension policies. But in a series of ripostes web users highlighted the rumoured strained relations between Putin and his premier, and indulged in mockery of their leaders. 'Dmitry Medvedev's twitter was hacked by Vladimir Putin. They just pull each other's leg like that,' said Spisok Debilov. President Vladimir Putin's (pictured) press secretary had initially seemed less sure. 'I don't have any information, but I'm pretty sure that this was a hacker,' he said .

Zone1508 posted: 'In the rest of the world when politicians' accounts are hacked some nonsense starts to appear - only in Russia the truth that everyone was waiting for.'

"This little boy gets a firm ticking off from his mother - after getting buried up to his shoulders in mud on a Somerset beach yesterday. The youngster got an earful after apparently straying onto mudflats which are exposed at low tide in Weston-super-Mare. He is seen bursting into tears as the furious woman wags her finger in front of his face. The incident happened a few miles from the spot where Lelaina Hall, five, died after getting trapped in the mud at nearby Berrow beach in 2002. And the ever-present danger was underlined during the day as emergency crews were called out several times to reports of people stuck in the mud. Three call-outs were for missing children, who were all located safely. A seven-year-old boy had to be checked over by an ambulance crew. Last year, fire crews had to send a hovercraft to rescue five people after they became stuck in mud on the same beach.

Mark Newman, Chairman of BARB Search and Rescue - a charity that operates hovercrafts in the area - said the mud flats present a constant danger. 'We had a very busy weekend attending incidents of people who had got stuck in the mud or had gone missing from families,' he said.

I looked round and saw this mother screaming a a kid. ""I told you not to go down there, you're filthy"" and so on. 'Everyone stopped and looked around before the mother stormed off with some other children towards the car park. The muddy kid just followed on a little later.

"Matthew Matagrano: The 36-year-old has a lengthy rap sheet that includes a conviction for sodomy. He was jailed today for ten years . It has emerged that the jail-obsessed ex-con who broke into Manhattan Detention Center in February also assaulted and strip-searched an inmate during his bizarre visit. Matthew Matagrano, 36, impersonated a staff member by flashing a fake gold badge and then pinned an inmate up against a wall, grabbed his testicles and then ordered him into a cell where he made him remove all his clothes. Matagrano was already facing impersonation charges after blagging his way into the detention center where he spent seven-and-a-half hours with prisoners, handed out cigarettes and llegedly stole $5,000 worth of equipment from security officers. But now, the inmate has filed a . complaint against Matagrano, leading to the additional charge of . burglary as a sexually motivated felony which was filed on July 8th. After he was exposed, Matagrano admitted his brazen sneaking, but revealed his unusual admiration for correction workers. 'They give me food. They made me feel important,' said 5ft 8in, 340 pound Matagrano. Norman Seabrook, Correction union president, told the Daily News: 'We’re talking about a serious breach of security.' Matagrano was able hang around with . inmates on Rikers Island and the Manhattan Detention Center simply by . showing a fake shiny gold badge. Security breach: Most people who've done time on Rikers Island can't wait to get away. Officials say that for at least a week, Matthew Matagrano used a badge and ID card to get into Rikers and roam the jail in February . Matagrano waved his credentials to get into at least five different buildings over the last week. He allegedly stole $5,000 worth of equipment from security officers and even smoked cigarettes with some of the jail's inmates. Police . are only now just putting together a timeline of what happened using . some of the 24-hour surveillance video gathered from around the . facilities. According to the New York Post, on occasion Matagrano was able to access one of the highest-level security wings in the city. Whilst there he allegedly stole a $2,500 walkie-talke and then strolled around the cells. On Rikers Island, Matagrano tried to have seven inmates in protective custody moved to the prison’s general population. Worryingly, he was able to walk around the building and even pass through security checkpoints unhindered. Matagrano had a legitimate pass to some of the less secure areas of the facility including the car park because he had worked with a non-profit group on the island. Investigators . first realised something was amiss when Matagrano was seen in a . surveillance video walking through various high-level security areas. Correction . officers were then put on alert and his disguise was finally rumbled at . the Bronx Criminal Court after he was caught trying to 'rearrest' an . inmate.

"Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head, a renowned medical examiner revealed today - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds. Dr Michael Baden, who was asked by the family to perform an independent autopsy, told a press conference in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday he reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son had not suffered. The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by police officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis suburb on August 9. Family lawyer Benjamin Crump described the teen's death as an 'execution in broad daylight'. He said it was important for the family to have their own autopsy results as they did not trust the work of the local police. Scroll down for video . Dr Michael Baden points to his head where one of the bullets hit Michael Brown, believed to be the 'kill shot'. The family attorney's Benjamin Crump (left) and Daryl Parks look on during a press conference on Monday to discuss independent autopsy results . Ms McSpadden had just one question for her lawyers and medical examiners: 'What else do we need to get . them to arrest the killer of my child?' Dr Baden said the number of shots Michael Brown had suffered could have been revealed on day one of the investigation as withholding the information causes the family more pain. The doctor, a former chief medical examiner for New York City, said: 'We can answer those questions on day one... telling the family on day one, can be helpful in a trying time.' Attorney Daryl Parks said that the shot which killed Michael supported eye-witness reports that his head was in the downward position, trying to surrender to the officer. Shawn Parcells, a forensic pathologist who assisted Dr Baden, used an anatomical diagram to explain each of the six shots they found. Assistant medical examiner Shawn Parcells indicates that the wound which struck Michael Brown's forearm could have hit from behind or when his hands were raised . This sketch from Dr Michael Baden's post-mortem examination report showed the places where Michael Brown was shot. Two bullets entered his head - one through his eye - and four bullets hit his right arm . The 18-year-old was shot twice in the head and four times on the arm. One bullet entered and exited Brown several times. That shot struck the teen above the right eyeball, went through his face, left through his jaw and re-entered his . collarbone. It is believed that five of the shots hit Brown on the front of his body. However . Parcells said that the gunshot wound to Brown's forearm appeared to be . consistent with someone walking away or putting their arms up in a . surrender or defensive manner before adding, 'but we don't know'. Following . the family's press conference on Monday, St Louis County medical . examiner Mary Case said Brown had suffered between six and eight gunshot . wounds and was shot from the front. The teenager also had marijuana in his system when he died, a source told The Washington Post. Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, wept on Monday as she appeared alongside family attorney Benjamin Crump, who discussed details of a private autopsy on her son. The examination revealed that 18-year-old Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head . Family attorney Benjamin Crump said . during a TV interview on Monday morning that the family had ordered an independent autopsy because . they did not trust local law enforcement. Michael Brown was most likely killed by a shot to the top of his head, a medical examiner said on Monday . He said: 'They did not want to rely on the autopsy from St Louis law enforcement officials who they believe executed their son in broad daylight. 'Our clients understood that relying on the police autopsy was not a good thing.' The Department of Justice is currently conducting a third autopsy on Michael Brown. Brown's mother wept today as she spoke out following the devastating autopsy results which were released on Sunday. Lesley McSpadden appeared on GMA on Monday along with attorney Benjamin Crump who said the family were deeply troubled by the independent autopsy results. Mr . Crump said: 'The witnesses were telling the truth. Michael Brown Jr was . shot multiple times and most troubling was the head shot.' Ms McSpadden had asked that autopsy questions not be directed to her. She wept as she said: 'We want justice... being fair.' When . asked by GMA anchor Robin Roberts what would bring justice for the . family, Ms McSpadden replied: 'Arresting this man and making him . accountable for his actions.' The . autopsy was conducted by Dr Michael M Baden, the former chief medical . examiner for New York City. Baden has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial. While Dr Baden did not comment on the heated . debate surrounding Wilson's actions, he did say the sheer amount of gun . shots was out of the ordinary. 'In my capacity as the forensic . examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, ""You’re not . supposed to shoot so many times,""' Dr Baden told the New York Times. 'Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.' The newspaper said the bullets did not appear to have come from very close range because there was no gunpowder on his body. St Louis County Police released preliminary results of their autopsy, KSDK reported. The report concluded that the teen died of gunshot wounds but would not specify how many bullets had hit the teenager. The autopsy, which was conducted the day after the teen died, is preliminary. No further details about Brown's death will be released by police until toxicology results become available in the next four weeks. Officer Darren Wilson, 28, (pictured) was identified on Friday as the cop who shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown . Slain in broad daylight: This image provided by KMOV-TV shows investigators inspecting the body of Brown on August 9, where he was shot in Ferguson. Brown's death has ignited days of clashes with furious protesters . The . results of the post-mortem examination emerged as Missouri's governor . ordered the state National Guard into Ferguson after it was convulsed by . yet another night of clashes between police and protesters. Governor . Jay Nixon said the National Guard would help 'in restoring peace and . order' to Ferguson, where protests continued last night. Police . said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, . looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails. 'These . violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his . memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be . served and to feel safe in their own homes,' Nixon said in a statement. The . National Guard is a reserve military force, and its deployment marks a . serious escalation of the crackdown on dissent in Ferguson, which has a majority African-American population. Dr . Baden's post-mortem examination found Brown was shot a total of six . times, with four bullet wounds in his right arm and two in his head. The final shot appears to have entered Brown's head at the top of the skull suggesting his head was bowed down at the time. 'This . one here looks like his head was bent downward,' he said of the wound . at the top of Brown's skull. 'It can be because he’s giving up, or . because he’s charging forward at the officer.' Dr . Baden, 80, is one of only 400 board-certified forensic pathologists in the . country and he has reviewed autopsies for both President John F Kennedy . and Martin Luther King Jr. He has performed 20,000 autopsies and hosted the HBO show Autopsy. He . criticized authorities in St Louis county for keeping details of . Brown's death concealed - which has only made the community more . enraged. 'People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day One,' Dr. Baden said. 'They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.' Considering the sensitivity around Brown's death, Dr Baden decided to waive his usual $10,000 fee. The . Brown family's attorney, Benjam L Crump, paid to fly Dr Baden out on . Sunday to perform the autopsy at Austin A Layne Mortuary. He says the autopsy results prove that Wilson's actions were unjustified. 'The . sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his . body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very . people he was supposed to protect in that community,' Mr. Crump said. 'We . want to make sure people understand what this case is about: This case . is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad . daylight.' Following Brown's death, Ferguson has become a hot-bed of protest, and the Rev Jesse Jackson thinks the latest autopsy results will only lead to more outrage. 'This is bound to escalate tensions,' Rev Jackson told CNN. 'This is a very provocative report.' Dr Baden consulted with the St Louis County Medical Examiner before performing his autopsy. Brown's body is expected to undergo a total of three autopsies, with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder scheduling a rare extra examination by the Justice Department. The Ferguson Police Department has not commented on the latest autopsy results.","Family released independent autopsy results on Sunday which revealed Michael Brown, 18, was shot at least six times by officer Darren Wilson .

"Arsenal face Besiktas at the formidable Ataturk Stadium on Tuesday night bidding to reach the Champions League group stages for the 17th consecutive year. Sportsmail provides the lowdown on the Gunners' opponents ahead of the first leg of the qualifying tie in Istanbul. VIDEO Scroll down for Besiktas Manager Slaven Bilic: We're not here for a jolly up . Fighting spirit: Arsenal get into the mood to face Besiktas with a playful scrap in training on Monday . First look: Arsene Wenger (centre) and Mathieu Flamini (left) takes a stroll on the pitch at the Ataturk Stadium . So what do Arsenal have to worry about? 76,000 raging Turks is never a hospitable sight. It will be raucous, visceral and unpleasant. When Manchester United visited in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson said afterwards: 'The fans made the loudest noise I have ever heard.' Arsenal will have to show that they are made of the right stuff and silence the Ataturk Stadium. Flying the flag: Besiktas supporters are passionate, noisy and generate a fearsome atmosphere . Firestarter: Besiktas supporters revel in the heat of a Champions League clash against Chelsea in 2003 . Anything to concern Arsenal on the pitch? Pre-season can often be a deception - just ask Manchester United - but Besiktas did beat Chelsea 1-0 in Istanbul just a few weeks ago. It was, however, only a 45-minute game. The Turks also lost 2-1 against Wigan Athletic in a friendly game this summer. Danger sign? Oguzhan Ozyakup  (right) and Willian (left) during Besiktas's pre-season defeat of Chelsea . Who do Arsenal need to watch out for? Demba Ba is the main man, having moved to Besiktas this summer after scoring 50 goals in English football over the course of three seasons at West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea. Another former Premier League player - Kerim Frei - who spent a couple of seasons at Fulham, is highly-rated by Arsenal's Turkish opposition. Familiar face: Demba Ba (centre) now leads the line for the Turks after his summer move from Chelsea . And who's the leader on the sidelines? Slaven Bilic, the former West Ham defender that rather enjoys knocking English teams out of competitions. He was the man in charge of Croatia when they defeated Steve McClaren's England home and away to deny the Three Lions' progress into Euro 2008. Bogey man: Former West Ham, Everton and Croatia defender Slaven Bilic is boss at Besiktas . Reason to be cheerful? Arsenal have a potent record against Turkish opposition. Over 90 minutes, they have played seven games, winning four of those and drawing three. Arsenal also defeated Turkish side Fenerbahce to qualify for the Champions League group stages last season. Reason to be fearful? Arsenal fans still rue that UEFA Cup final in Copenhagen in 2000, when the Gunners were defeated by Galatasaray in a penalty shootout. Davor Suker and Patrick Vieira both missed from the spot to hand the victory to the Turkish side. In clashes before the game, four men were stabbed. Paid the penalty: Nwankwo Kanu (left), Davor Suker (centre) and Marc Overmars (right) after Arsenal's UEFA Cup final defeat against Galatasaray in Copenhagen in 2000.

"Sir Cliff Richard is set to miss his annual trip to New York for the US Open while he faces underage sex abuse allegations. The tennis fan, 73, could be prevented from entering the United States while he is questioned by British detectives over accusations he sexually assaulted a boy in the 1980s. The singer visits Flushing Meadows for the tournament every year, but border officials could block him when he lands on US soil - even though he owns a flat in the city. Scroll down for video . Sir Cliff Richard, pictured at the US Open in 2012, is set to miss his annual trip to New York while he faces child sex assault allegations . Star: Sir Cliff Richard performs at the 1985  Christian rally in Sheffield where police sources say he is alleged to have molested a young boy. The singer will return to the UK within days . According to the US Embassy website, . suspects arrested 'for an offence or crime involving moral turpitude' will have their visa applications rejected. However those questioned . under caution are assessed on a 'case-by-case' basis. He can make a personal visit to the US Embassy to argue his case for a visa. However, a source told The Sun: 'You would be mad to try to get on a plane if you had a child abuse inquiry hanging over you.' A spokesman for the US Embassy in London told the newspaper: 'We do not comment on individuals.' Earlier this year Nigella Lawson was . prevented from travelling to Los Angeles after a court was told she . had taken to cocaine. Sir . Cliff has been assured he will not be arrested when he returns from his . vineyard in Portugal, but he will be interviewed under caution. Police . were yesterday forced to defend their decision to allow the BBC access . to their raid on Sir Cliff’s Sunningdale, Berkshire, home on Thursday. Singer: . Sir Cliff performed backstage for staff after the Billy Graham event at . Bramall Lane in 1985, together right - he strenuously denies any . wrongdoing . Concert: Cliff Richard stands alongside Billy Graham at the evangelical rally at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane Stadium in June 1985 . The pair were seen talking before Sir Cliff performed in front of 47,000 fans. The alleged assault was said to have taken place during the event . 'Completely . false': Sir Cliff, pictured at the FM Algarve studio on Sunday, has . vehemently denied a claim that he committed a sexual offence with a boy . under the age of 16 in the 1980s . The singer said he was angry that the first he knew of the operation was when he saw it on television. He accused officers of leaking information to ‘the Press’, mistakenly suggesting newspapers had also been tipped off. A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police, who are leading the investigation, said: ‘When a media outlet contacted South Yorkshire Police with information about an investigation, we took the decision to work with them in order to protect the integrity of that investigation. 'Since the search took place, a number of people have contacted the police to provide information and we must acknowledge that the media played a part in that, for which we are grateful.’ Spectacle: The singer watches the tournament at Flushing Meadows every year - but could be stopped by border officials when he steps onto US soil . Upset: Fans from all over the world have rushed to defend Sir Cliff after the allegations . 'For . many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic . impropriety which have been circulating online. The allegations are . completely false. 'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen. 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except, it would appear, to the press. 'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will co-operate fully should the police wish to speak to me. 'Beyond . stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be . appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has . concluded.' Police refused to comment on the nature of the information they had received. Their investigation centres on claims that Sir Cliff sexually assaulted a boy at an event in  Sheffield held by the American preacher Billy Graham in 1985. Sir Cliff, who has dismissed the accusations as ‘completely false’, is expected to cut short his holiday in Portugal to meet detectives within days. Officers said they were keen to speak to him ‘as soon as possible’. The singer’s lawyers are in talks with the police about a single allegation of serious sexual assault reported by a man in his 40s. Stung by criticism from Sir Cliff and his fans, Jonathan Munro, the BBC’s head of news-gathering, took the unusual step of going on Twitter to confirm that the source of its original story was not South Yorkshire Police, but refused to say who it was. Thames Valley Police, which provided five of the eight officers who searched Sir Cliff’s home over five hours, were also quick to deny any leak to media outlets. The Mail understands that a BBC  producer acting on a tip-off phoned South Yorkshire Police, who confirmed the timing of the raid so that police could carry out their inquiries before the story broke. Detectives were concerned that any advance publicity would have given Sir Cliff prior warning, risking ‘the integrity of the investigation’. Old . friend: Sir Cliff’s former manager Bill Latham, pictured together, who . lived with the star for 30 years, denounced the allegations as . ‘fiction’. Support: . Sir Cliff's close friend Gloria Hunniford (pictured together at . Wimbledon in 2011) said yesterday: ‘I’ve never seen Cliff put a foot or a . word wrong in his life, never. He is a gorgeous man’ Sir . Cliff Richard was furious that members of the press appeared to find . out his luxury UK flat was being raided by police before he did. Crews for the BBC were positioned outside the private estate where the singer has a £3.1million property as police swooped in. And the BBC appeared to have a pre-recorded interview with a leading police officer involved in the case. In his statement, Sir Cliff pointedly said that he had been given no notice of the search. The . singer said: 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire . today without notice, except, it would appear, to the press. 'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will co-operate fully should the police wish to speak to me.' He was in the Algarve when he learned of the raid, and his publicist promptly issued a strong denial of the claim. It is not clear if the singer plans to return to the UK. A spokesman from the BBC declined to comment on the source of their story. The force also provided the BBC with an exclusive interview with Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, which was broadcast within moments of the raid starting. Tory MP Nigel Evans said ‘questions have got to be answered’ about the BBC’s presence at Sir Cliff’s home. He told Good Morning Britain: ‘It appears the Press knew what was happening before he did and the world’s media were camped outside his doorstep. 'A Press helicopter was up before the police even arrived – he is quite right to be angry about that.’ The allegation against Sir Cliff first emerged in October 2012 when the alleged victim contacted Mark Williams-Thomas, an investigative journalist and former detective who worked on an ITV documentary exposing Jimmy Savile. Yesterday, Mr Williams-Thomas confirmed that he had also passed new information to the police about Sir Cliff in addition to the allegations he heard from the alleged victim. The singer has strenuously denied the claims but stressed that he would ‘co-operate fully should the police wish to speak to me’. He said: ‘For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online. 'The allegations are completely false.’ Yesterday, the singer arrived at his £3million Algarve home with friends without stopping to make any  comment to journalists. Portuguese police confirmed they have not been asked to search his holiday home. Home from home: Sir Cliff's property in the Algarve, where he is thought to be staying . Investigation: Stills from news footage showed police arriving at the home of Sir Cliff Richard near Sunningdale, Berkshire. A convoy of cars was seen entering the complex before leaving at around 3.30pm . Sir Cliff Richard bought his apartment in the prestigious Charters complex in Sunningdale, Berkshire, for £3.1million in 2008. Police were said to be searching the  property in relation to an alleged historical sex offence . Search: People, thought to be police officers involved in the search, inside the property . Preacher: The allegation is understood to relate to a major stadium rally in Sheffield by US preacher Billy Graham in June 1985. Pictured: Cliff Richard with Billy Graham at a 1984 rally at Birmingham's Villa Park . 'Passionate': Sir Cliff with Una Stubbs . According to his biographer, Steve Turner, Sir Cliff has only had three significant partners. It has been widely reported that he lost his virginity at 18 to Carol Harris, the wife of Shadows bandmate Jet. In a biography he dismissed the affair as mere infatuation, claiming that what happened between them was 'not right', and painting her as his seductress. At 22, he had a passionate affair with actress Una Stubbs, then 24, on the set of the film Wonderful Life, released in 1964. In the early Eighties he enjoyed a three-year friendship with former Wimbledon ace Sue Barker, even at one point considering marriage. In 2010 a letter written by Sir Cliff to then girlfriend Delia wicks in 1961 emerged. In the Dear John letter, sent as he toured Australia, he wrote: 'Being a pop singer I have to give up one priceless thing – the right to any lasting relationship with any special girl. 'I've just had to make, probably, one of the biggest decisions I'm ever going to make and I'm hoping that it won't hurt you too much.' In the 1980s, he considered marriage to Sue Barker, the former tennis champion and host of the BBC's Question of Sport. Sir Cliff is often accompanied by his trusted companion and friend, former Roman Catholic priest John McElynn. Once an American missionary, Mr McElynn has been friends with the singer for more than a decade and looks after his property portfolio. Sir Cliff once said of him: 'He has become a companion, which is great, because I don't like living alone'.

"Gingrich extremely critical of Ronald Reagan, says former colleague . Romney edges slightly ahead of Gingrich in latest poll . Newt Gingrich promised last night to establish a permanent base on the moon by 2020 if he's elected as U.S. president. Gingrich, the former House speaker, told a packed room that he wanted to develop a robust commercial space industry in line with the airline boom of the 1930s, leading to a permanent base on the moon. On a campaign stop ahead of the Florida primary next Tuesday, the GOP presidential hopeful told an audience in Cocoa, on Florida's space coast, his plan would benefit 'science, tourism and manufacturing'. Scroll down for video . On a different planet? Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich greets people during a meeting in Cocoa, Florida where he claimed he would put a permanent base on the moon by 2020 if elected . Gingrich, the former House speaker, said that he wanted to develop a robust commercial space industry in line with the airline boom of the 1930s, leading to a permanent base on the moon . Gingrich, a long-time space enthusiast, also said he wanted to expand exploration of Mars, saying NASA could pay for ambitious plans by teaming up with the private sector. The claims appeared to thrill the 700-strong crowd. The region is primarily known for NASA and was still suffering from a round of federal cuts to the space program last year. According to the Miami Herald, Gingrich said: 'By the end of my second term. We will have the first permanent base on the moon and it will be American... Does that mean I'm visionary? You betcha.' He added: 'We clearly have the capacity that Chinese and the Russians will never come anywhere close to us.' Gingrich's grandiose claims to the Florida space community came as one former White House colleague, who worked with Gingrich in the 1980s under Ronald Regan, described his relationship with the former president quite differently to Gingrich often fondly remembers in speeches. Elliott Abrams, former assistant secretary of state, said that rather than Gingrich working side by side with Regan he was often extremely vocal in his criticism. Insults: A former colleague has accused Gingrich (right) of fighting with Ronald Regan (left) calling the former president's foreign policies 'failures' while he was part of his administration . In the National Review, Mr Abrams wrote that Gingrich's opinions of Regan's plans to defeat Communism were scathing. He . quotes Gingrich in 1986, as saying: 'Measured against the scale and . momentum of the Soviet empire’s challenge, the Reagan administration has . failed, is failing, and without a dramatic change in strategy will . continue to fail. . . . President Reagan is clearly failing.' 'By the end of my second term. We will . have the first permanent base on the moon and it will be American... Does that mean I'm visionary? You betcha.' Newt Gingrich . Mr Abrams, who was also a deputy national security adviser to George W. Bush, added that Gingrich often refused to support Regan in his political decisions - and that he was often wrong in this choice. A poll taken before Monday night's debate between the four remaining candidates - Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul - showed little between frontrunners Romney and Gingrich. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt . Romney lead former House Speaker Newt Gingrich by just two points in . Florida, showing how close the race in a key primary had come. Some 36 per cent of Republicans likely to vote in Florida's primary said . they intend to vote for Romney while 34 per cent would choose Gingrich, . according to the CNN poll last night. Former Senator Rick Santorum garnered 13 per cent support while Representative Ron Paul won 10 per cent. The . poll was conducted across Florida after the South Carolina primary last . weekend where Gingrich beat Romney by 12 points, reviving his campaign . and showing that the race for the Republican nomination was far from . over. The intensity of the Republican race lead to vicious attacks by the frontrunners. At forums in Florida, Romney and Gingrich needled each other over immigration policy in the state, where 13 per cent of registered voters are Hispanic. Gingrich also took the opportunity to . ridicule rival Mitt Romney's call for self-deportation of illegal . immigrants as an 'Obama-level fantasy' that would be inhumane to . long-established families living in America. Romney in turn accused Gingrich of . pandering to a Hispanic audience and said the former Speaker himself had . supported self-deportation in the past. Appealing to all voters: GOP hopeful Mitt Romney campaigns at a US-Cuba Democracy Political Action Committee Event at at Miami-Dade College, in Miami, Florida . Gingrich criticized Romney's . immigration policy during a forum with the Spanish-language television . network Univision, saying the idea of self-deportation would never work. Romney retaliated later in the day at the same forum. During . a debate earlier this week, Romney said he favors self-deportation over . policies that would require the federal government to round up millions . of illegal immigrants and send them back to their home countries. Advocates of Romney's approach argue that illegal immigration can be . curbed by denying public benefits, prompting illegals to leave the U.S. on their own. 'You have to . live in a world of Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island accounts and . automatically $20 million income for no work to have some fantasy this . far from reality,' Gingrich said, alluding to details in Romney's income . tax returns that were made public on Tuesday. 'For . Romney to believe that somebody's grandmother is going to be so cut off . that she is going to self-deport, I mean this is an Obama-level . fantasy.' However Gingrich's campaign has spoken of the self-deportation policy he ridiculed yesterday. Battling on: Supporters applaud Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum during a campaign rally at the First Baptist Church in Naples, Florida . 'I recognize that it's very tempting to come out to an audience like this and pander to the audience,' Romney said, pointing out that Gingrich has previously made comments supporting the idea of self-deportation. 'I think that was a mistake on his part.' At the forum, Gingrich spoke instead about other elements of his immigration plan, including controlling the border and establishing a guest-worker program to better manage the influx of immigrants. Gingrich said he favors a path to citizenship for illegal immigrant children who serve in the military but not for simply completing college. Romney defended his opposition to allowing the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at American universities. He said there are inexpensive options that will allow them to go to college. Gingrich told Univision he believes states should charge in-state tuition rates for students who were born in the U.S. to illegal immigrant parents, but that he favors charging out-of-state tuition for children who were brought to this country illegally. Gingrich began the interview by . speaking a few halting phrases of welcome in Spanish, saying 'buenos . dias estudiantes' but begged off when moderator Jorge Ramos pressed him . to go further. Romney did not speak any Spanish during his interview. Romney was asked about family members . he has living in Mexico. Romney's father, George Romney, was born in . Mexico but moved back to the U.S. as a young child. Ramos asked Romney . if he had a claim to being Mexican American. 'I don't think people would think I . was being honest with them if I said I was Mexican American but I'd . appreciate it if you'd get that word out,' Romney joked. Both candidates addressed the future of communist Cuba after their interviews. In a speech on Latin America policy, . Gingrich said the U.S. needs to take a more active role in demanding . change in Fidel Castro's Cuba, much like it did to encourage the Arab . spring movement that toppled autocratic leaders in north Africa and the . Middle East. 'I don't think it's ever occurred to . anyone in the White House to look south and propose a Cuban spring,' Gingrich said. 'If [former Egyptian President Hosni] Mubarak was bad, . Castro is worse.' Romney, who has significant support . from the Cuban-American political establishment in Miami, railed against . Castro's regime in a speech before several hundred Cuban-American . democracy activists. 'It is time for us to strive for . freedom in Cuba, and I will do so as president,' he said. 'We must be . prepared to support the voices for democracy in Cuba.'","Gingrich extremely critical of Ronald Reagan, says former colleague .

"Jo Pavey, a 40-year-old mother-of-two, won Commonwealth bronze in the 5,000m, 17 years after competing in her first major championships. It was a gutsy piece of distance running from an Englishwoman who simply refused to bow down to the might of Kenyan distance running, or to be limited by the supposed barriers of age. ‘Best race of the Games for me,’ was former 10,000m world champion Liz McColgan’s verdict - and she should know, after all. Delighted: Jo Pavey took Commonwealth Games bronze in the 5,000 metres at Hampden Park on Saturday . Put your hands up! Kenyan Mercy Cherono clinched the gold as Pavey strode home for third . Mercy Cherono, 23, maintained Kenya’s record of winning every women’s distance event in Glasgow with her time of 15mins 7.21secs, but it was Pavey who produced the most remarkable display to win bronze, just 10 months after giving birth to her second child, Emily. Pavey said: ‘It feels a bit surreal real, to be honest. I tried to think: “Just don’t regret this.” ‘It’s so easy to think: “Oh, they are Kenyans, they are so good.” I thought no, keep focusing and just tried to beat them. ‘It’s really special to think my little boy is watching me. We debated whether to bring my little girl but I really worried she’d be terrified as she is only 10 months old. ‘It’s really special to think that I am 40, a mum with two children.’ Hard yards! The 40-year-old showed a breathtaking turn of pace on the home straight . Pavey was one of two 40-year-old English athletes in the field alongside Helen Clitheroe, competing in her fifth consecutive Commonwealth Games, who finished 11th. The third English competitor, European junior cross-country champion Emelia Gorecka, who finished eighth, would only have been three years old when Pavey reached the 1500m semi-finals at the 1997 World Championships - the same age as Pavey’s son Jacob, who was watching at Hampden Park last night. His mother spoiled the anticipated Kenyan 1-2-3 by sprinting past Margaret Muriuki in the home straight and nearly catching Janet Kisa, who finished second. It was the least Pavey deserved for pushed on with 1200m remaining as she attempted to run the sting out of the Kenyan trio, and going again at the bell. It had looked like a brave fourth place was beckoning when she was passed with 200m to go, but Pavey gritted her teeth and produced another spurt coming off the final bend to win Commonwealth bronze.","Kenyan Mercy Cherono claimed the gold at Hampden Park .

"The International Cricket Council has announced it is to consider the ruling from the James Anderson-Ravindra Jadeja case before deciding whether to appeal. England seamer Anderson, who was training with his team-mates at Old Trafford on Tuesday ahead of the fourth Test, was last week cleared of any wrong-doing by judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis relating to an incident with India all-rounder Jadeja in the first Investec Test at Trent Bridge, with insufficient evidence said to be crucial in the retired Australian judge's verdict. With the Board of Control for Cricket in India unable to appeal the decision, only the ICC - where India hold increasingly significant political sway - can act. Not guilty: England's James Anderson was cleared of 'pushing and abusing' India's Ravrindra Jadeja . Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch .

"Real Madrid's stars have been in training ahead of the first leg of their Super Cup battle with bitter cross-town rivals Atletico on Tuesday. Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale led the way during the session, with new boys James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos also involved at their training base in Madrid. Also in attendance were Sami Khedira and Angel di Maria, who have both been linked with a host of Premier League clubs throughout the summer. Usual suspects: Cristiano Ronaldo, forward Karim Benzema, Fabio Coentrao and Gareth Bale set up some hurdles during a session . Back in action: And Sami Khedira was also back in training despite continued speculation that he is set for a move away from the club .

New boys: Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez will both hope to impress as they look to continue their good start at Real Madrid . Competition: Goalkeepers Iker Casillas and Keylor Navas are set to face off for the No 1 jersey at Real Madrid this season . Face off: Navas had a superb World Cup with Costa Rica whilst Casillas had a slightly more disappointing tournament with Spain . And despite being linked with a big-money move to Manchester United before the end of the transfer window, Carlo Ancelotti has insisted that Di Maria will be available for selection to him. 'I don't want to enter into this theme so I don't lose focus on tomorrow's game,' said Madrid's boss. 'Di Maria is available like all the others. He may or may not start the game and has opportunities, but like everyone else. 'What I won't do is put out the same team in both legs. One team will play tomorrow and on Friday I will change it a little. 'I don't know what Di Maria has decided. But I know that he's training and that he could help us in tomorrow's match.

The first leg of the tie is set to take place at the Bernabeu, with the return leg on Friday at Atletico's home the Vicente Calderon. It is the first time since 2008 that Barcelona haven't been involved in the Spanish curtain-raiser. Training together were Real Madrid captain and stalwart Iker Casillas, and new goalkeeper Kaylor Navas, who signed for the club over the summer. Casillas started Real Madrid's first game of the season in their 2-0 UEFA Super Cup victory over Sevilla last week, but Costa Rican Navas is expected to provide stern competition for his No 1 jersey over the course of the campaign. Against Sevilla, Real Madrid put out the most expensive starting team in the history of football thanks to arrivals of Colombian Rodriguez from Monaco for £60m and Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich for £20m. Ronaldo, Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric formed the rest of Real Madrid's midfield and attack, and they are set to lineup with the same team against their rivals. For Atletico, it is their first competitive game of the season, and Diego Simeone will be hoping that Mario Mandzukic's arrival from Bayern Munich can provide adequate cover for the departed Diego Costa.

"Sportsmail's investigation into alleged racial, sexist and homophobic messages sent by Malky Mackay and Iain Moody shocked football to it's very core on Wednesday night. Here's how those involved in the game reacted... SAM ALLARDYCE - West Ham manager . You can be lost in this game very quickly. You can take years to build up your reputation – there’s lots of top-quality managers of my era that very rarely get an opportunity now. Reputation: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says lots of managers from his era rarely get any opportunities now . Investigation: Malky Mackay (right) and Iain Moody have been accused of being racist, sexist and homophobicin a series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff City . LORD OUSELEY - Chairman, Kick It Out . These revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism, and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game. IBRAHIM FARAH - Former Cardiff player . No one knows what happens behind the scenes in football clubs. At the time when you’re a young pro, no one will listen. People would listen to the manager not me so I chose to keep my mouth shut. KEITH MILLEN - Palace caretaker manager . Iain Moody was brought in to recruit players, and the chairman will look at that. Each day something’s unfolded, something’s come out, it’s been difficult. I had a chat with the players about staying focused. Difficult: Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen has told his Eagles players they must remain focused . TIM HARTLEY - Chairman of the Cardiff City Supporters’ Trust . The Trust condemns without reservation any racist, homophobic and sexist comments whenever and wherever they are made. THE GAY FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS’ NETWORK . The GFSN is saddened to hear reports of alleged homophobic comments. Homophobia is still a problem in football. We will be following the story closely and asking the FA to fully investigate the allegations. STAN COLLYMORE - Former Liverpool and England striker . LMA statement. ******* disgraceful. Institutional acceptance of the ‘banter’ of casual racism. Disgraceful: Former Liverpool and England striker Stan Collymore was unhappy with the LMA statement . WOMEN IN FOOTBALL . We’re gravely concerned by recent revelations of sexist, racist, homophobic & anti-semitic texts. This year has shown us that sexism is endemic in the game. It should not be acceptable to make bigoted comments... irrespective of whether these are made publicly or privately. JASON ROBERTS - Former Blackburn striker . It’s OK people, nothing to see, it was just banter! Ladies and Gentlemen, the LMA...OMG! I’m done, the LMA said it better than I ever could. They are actually being serious! Somebody drafted that...WOW! Shock: Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts couldn't believe the LMA's statement was serious . The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.","Malky Mackay and Iain Moody reported to FA after series of texts .

"George Groves is 'back on the hunt for success' and itching to get back in the ring following back-to-back defeats to British super-middleweight rival Carl Froch. Groves first lost his unbeaten record as a professional to WBA and IBF champion Froch in controversial fashion before suffering a one-punch knockout in the eighth round of their return bout in front of an 80,000 crowd at Wembley.

"A Pakistani minister has offered $100,000 to anyone who kills the maker of the online anti-Islam video that has launched deadly protests across parts of the Muslim world. 'I announce today that this blasphemer, this sinner who has spoken nonsense about the holy Prophet, anyone who murders him, I will reward him with $100,000,' Railways Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour told a news conference on Saturday, to applause. 'I invite the Taliban brothers and the al Qaeda brothers to join me in this blessed mission.' Scroll down for video . Reward: Pakistan's Railway Minister Haji Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, center, has announced a $100,000 bounty on the head of a California filmmaker who created an anti-Muslim film (file photo) A spokesman for Pakistan's prime minister said the government disassociated itself from the minister's statement. While many Muslim countries saw mostly peaceful protests on Friday, fifteen people were killed in Pakistan during demonstrations over the video. People involved in the film titled 'Innocence of Muslims,' an amateurish 13-minute clip of which was posted on YouTube, have said it was made by a 55-year-old California man, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. Nakoula has not returned to his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos since leaving voluntarily to be interviewed by federal authorities. His family has since gone into hiding. In hiding: Filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is seen covered while escorted out of his home by police in California earlier this month while the man and his family have since gone into hiding . Stepping back: Pakistan's Prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf, seen right of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said their government has disassociated itself from the bounty . In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Saturday, thousands of Islamist activists clashed with police who used batons and teargas to clear an unauthorized protest. In Kano, northern Nigeria's biggest city, Shi'ite Muslims burned American flags, but their protest passed off peacefully. The demonstrations were less widespread than on Friday, but showed anger still simmered around the world against the film and other insults against Islam in the West, including cartoons published by a French satirical magazine. In the Libyan city of Benghazi, a crowd forced out an Islamist militia some U.S. officials blame for a deadly attack on the U.S. consulate during one of the first protests, on September 11. Ansar al-Sharia, which denies it was involved in the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, quit the city after its base was stormed by Libyans angry at armed groups that control parts of the country. Memory: The main entrance of the U.S. consulate that was attacked last week is seen in Benghazi city, decorated in memorial of slain Ambassador Christopher Stevens . That might go some way to vindicate U.S. President Barack Obama's faith in Libya's nascent democracy where Ambassador Christopher Stevens had worked to help rebels oust Muammar Gaddafi only to be killed in a surge of anti-Americanism. 'It's the view of this administration that it's a pretty clear sign from the Libyan people that they're not going to trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of the mob,' said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. 'It's also an indication that the Libyan people are not comfortable with the voices of a few extremists and those who advocate and perpetrate violence, to drown out the voices and aspirations of the Libyan people.' In Egypt, the leader of Egypt's main ultra orthodox Islamist party, that shares power with the more moderate Muslim Brotherhood, said the film and the French cartoons were part of a rise of anti-Islamic actions since the Arab spring revolts. 'A new reality in the Middle East has emerged after the toppling of autocratic regime of Hosni Mubarak and others through democratic elections that brought newly-elected Islamist governments,' Emad Abdel Ghaffour, leader of the Salafist Nour Party, told Reuters. 'There are interest groups who seek to escalate hatred to show newly-elected governments and their Muslim electorate as undemocratic,' he said. Nour, whose party is the second largest in parliament and plays a formidable force in Egypt's new politics, said President Mohamed Mursi should demand 'legislation or a resolution to criminalize 'contempt of Islam as a religion and its Prophet' at the U.N. General Assembly next week.","Railways Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour's reward is said to be disassociated from Pakistani government .

The former England midfielder will embark on his latest career turn next week as a pundit for BT Sport in their Premier League curtain-raiser between United and Swansea. Speaking to Sam Wallace ahead of the launch of his new column in the i and Independent newspapers, he vowed not to change his forthright ways. 'I say it as I think it is.

The 39-year-old hit the headlines after he suggested Rooney was 'past his best' in an online World Cup column for bookmakers Paddy Power. Striker Rooney was angered by the cutting comments, saying Scholes had 'upset a lot of people at Manchester United'. 'It was a bit strange, I'll be honest, but he has his opinions and he's entitled to them,' Rooney said in June. 'I'm sure he's upset a lot of people at Man United because they see me as worthy of signing a new deal at the club, so they obviously have got a different opinion to what Paul has.'

Scholes, meanwhile, was unable to prevent the United legends losing 5-1 in front of a bumper crowd of over 12,000 in Eccles and was showered with ice cubes by Neville immediately after the defeat. And speaking to the I and Independent newspapers, he insisted he doesn't miss playing professional football. 'It's not something I think about,' said Scholes, who also admitted that it was Sky Sports star Neville who 'twisted his arm' into following his footsteps when he hung up his boots just over a year ago.

Time for a chuckle: Sterling is currently in the USA with Liverpool as part of their pre-season tour . 'The physical side is part of the game,' said Sterling, whose speed and balance can make a chump out of any defender. 'You are going to get defenders who want to let you know they are there, make you feel their presence. 'I've got to keep my temper, stay calm and try to play the game the way I think it should be played. If I can play well and score, they will know it's not all about being physical. 'I will definitely be keeping a cool temperament and doing my best for the team.' For someone 5ft6ins tall and of slight build, Sterling can handle himself. He's already picked up eight bookings in his fledgling career and his red card against Ecuador in June – when he slid in recklessly against Antonio Valencia – was described as a 'lesson' for the youngster by international boss Roy Hodgson. Sterling says his challenge is to let his talent do the talking whatever the provocation. 'If you are getting kicked a lot on the pitch, it must mean that you are a threat to the opposition because they want to stop you as early as possible,' he said. 'In this game, you've just got to look at people like Messi or Ronaldo, they get kicked all the time, I think they are doing something right. 'I'm not saying I'm a Messi or Ronaldo but it's the same that if you are in an attacking position, defenders will try to kick you. It is just part of the game, you just have to get on with it and try to do your best.' Shining star: Sterling scored a stunning goal for Liverpool in their recent pre-season friendly with Man City . One to watch: Sterling is congratulated by team-mates following his goal against Man City at the Yankee Stadium in New York . There is a willingness to moderate his performances too and not try to win matches single-handedly every time he picks up the ball. 'I do like taking defenders on and making things happen, a goal or assist, but I need to try and mix my game up,' he acknowledges. 'It's not always about trying to take the man on, sometimes to try and play one or two touches, get in behind defenders and be a handful that way. It's a challenge for the new season.' Liverpool beat a number of top clubs to win Jamaica-born Sterling's signature from QPR at 15. He has won rave reviews as winger but recently has shown he can be a dynamic No10 too. He was the catalyst for Liverpool's 5-1 win against Arsenal, one of their best performances from a season that saw them come close to winning the Premier League, and impressed centrally at the World Cup when Hodgson picked him there against Italy. Diplomatically, he insists he is happy to play wherever manager Brendan Rodgers picks him. But there's a twinkle in his eye when he discusses the central playmaker's role where you can dictate the flow of the game. Three Lions positive: In an otherwise disastrous World Cup for England,  Sterling was one of the few stars to emerge with his reputation intact for the Three Lions . Learning experience: Sterling was sent off in a pre-World Cup friendly against Ecuador . 'The manager has trusted me a little to play the No10 role. I'd like to see myself inside more, becoming educated in that position,' he said. 'If I can get that bit more freedom, hopefully it would take my game to the next level and improve my goals-to-game ratio.' The point about goals is important. Suarez scored 31 last season and others will have to step up if the club are to have another tilt at the title and do well in the Champions League. Rodgers has signed five players this summer with more on the way but Sterling also wants to improve on the 10 goals he scored last season. 'Luis was a big part of last year, a massive part to be fair,' he admits. 'You've got Daniel (Sturridge) up front and the new player, but we all have to contribute to make up the missing goals. 'That is part of the next step for me, to improve my goal scoring. Not to put too much pressure on myself but that is definitely the challenge for me.' Every few years, a young English player comes along with complete self-belief that separates it from arrogance. Paul Gascoigne had it, Wayne Rooney had it, Sterling has it. He doesn't turn 20 til December by which time he will probably have racked up 100 games for one of the most famous clubs in Europe. If Liverpool don't sit down with him about a new contract this season, the likes of Real Madrid would be interested. Is he shocked by the speed of his progress? Apparently not. 'My aim was always to be in and around the first team as soon as possible,' he said. 'The club would give me a yearly schedule, Under 18s, reserves, first-team and I'm grateful a manager like Brendan came in and given me a chance. 'But I wouldn't say it is a real surprise because it's something I wanted, to play for a big club like this and show what I can do.' By his own admission, Sterling was glad to leave London, his career might have taken a different path had he stayed. Even at Primary School, behavioural problems were bad enough for him to be asked to leave. Turning the other cheek wasn't part of his life back then – but it's needed now.","Liverpool winger admits he has learned from Messi and Ronaldo in dealing with physical approach from defenders .

"A New Zealand man has been jailed for watching cartoon videos of elves, pixies and other fantasy creatures having sex. Ronald Clark was sentenced to three months behind bars for possessing objectionable material after downloading Japanese anime cartoons three years ago. His conviction in Auckland has sparked debate over what harm is caused by digitally created pornography. Jailed: A courtroom in Auckland jailed a man for three months for watching cartoon pornography . Clark, who has previous convictions for indecently assaulting a teenage boy and has been through rehabilitation programmes, said that the videos came from an established tradition of Japanese manga and hentai, which is cartoon pornography. Clark's lawyer Roger Bowden argued that the images weren't even depictions of people but of 'pixies and trolls' that 'you knew at a glance weren't human'. He went on to describe Clark's conviction as the 'law gone mad', according to the Opposing Views website. But Anti-child pornography group ECPAT Child Alert director Alan Bell said the images were illegal because they encouraged people 'to migrate from there to the real thing'. He conceded that no child had been harmed in the making of the images but said that 'it's all part of that spectrum'. He described images of child abuse as a huge problem in Japan claiming that the practice had found its way into computer games. Lincoln University philosophy lecturer Grant Tavinor, who writes on the aesthetics of video games, said the case raised two key questions: Did producing the pictures harm anyone, and could their viewing and distribution be injurious to the public good? Debate: Clark's sentencing for watching Japanese manga and hentai cartoons has sparked debate over what harm is caused by digitally created images. The manga style (pictured) enjoys popularity with all ages in Japan . He said: 'The worry is that viewing or distributing such images could support the sexual exploitation of children even if the production of the images did not actually involve the exploitation of any children.' 'It's not enough that no one was harmed in the making of the videos, the law takes a protective role and says there are some things we just don't want circulating in society,' he said. Auckland University associate philosophy professor Tim Dare added that the sentence would have been handed to Clark because of worries that the images could promote harm to real people in the future. Clark himself argued that under the law he could, in theory, be convicted of possessing objectionable images of stick figures. He admitted he was interested in the images but he said it was for their artistic merit and as 'a bit of a laugh'. He did not find them sexually arousing, he said. Mr Tavinor said there were ethical issues that complicated the case, adding that we naturally make moral judgements about the character of a person based on their chosen form of entertainment. But he concluded that it is dangerous to convict someone for their 'moral views'.","Ronald Clark was jailed for three months by a New Zealand court .

"Spot the Dog author Eric Hill, whose mischievous yellow puppy delighted children in sixty languages, has died at the age of 86. The London-born illustrator sold 60 million copies of the books after inventing the lift-the-flap concept which now permeates children's fiction. And in 2008, he was awarded an OBE for services to literature. Ingenious: Eric Hill, who has died aged 86, was hailed as a 'master of simple design' for creating Spot . Hailing him as a 'master of simple design', publisher Puffin paid tribute to Mr Hill, who died at home in California following a short illness. Francesca Dow, who runs Penguin’s children’s division, said: 'He created one of the world’s most . loveable children’s book characters - Spot, the charming, naughty, . playful puppy, loved and appreciated across the world. 'Eric’s . ingenious lift-the-flap device turned the reading of a Spot book into a . glorious game of hide and seek, enjoyed by children and adults alike. 'Puffin is proud to publish Eric Hill and will ensure Spot continues to delight children for generations to come.' Iconic: In 2010, Where's Spot was turned into a variety of special edition lift-the-flap books over the 34 years . Honoured: In 2008, Mr Gill was presented with an OBE for services to children's literature by Prince Charles . Eric Hill, born in Holloway, north London, was evacuated during the Second World War, but returned as soon as he could before the war ended. He became an assistant in an illustration studio. In the 1940s, he took up a job in advertising, which led to him becoming a creative director and illustrator. It was 1979 when he was experimenting with an advert featuring a lift-the-flap function that Mr Gill realised how much it excited his son Christopher - then aged three. He decided to create Spot. At first, publishers were reluctant to run the new-fangled design, but when Where's Spot was released in 1980 it was an instant hit. It was soon followed by another hit - Spot's First Walk - and then, in 1983, an animated series, The Adventures Of Spot. He was involved in every script and frame.By the 1990s, the books had been translated in 60 different languages. The books follow Spot, a yellow puppy with brown spots and a brown-tipped tail, and his adventures with his parents, grandparents, brother and sister - plus a conglomerate of animals including a crocodile and a hippo. The franchise began in 1980, with the release of Where's Spot, and became an instant success. Soon, audiobooks - narrated by The Vicar Of Dibley's Jane Horrocks - and an animated TV series followed. In a statement, his family said they would miss him 'immensely'. They said: 'Although this time of loss is a great hardship for us, we can honestly say that we take some solace in the joy he brought to so many children and families through his work. 'We know Spot, and therefore Eric, has had a beloved presence in so many homes and bedtime readings. And we know we share our grief with many.' Mr Hill, who avoided publicity and often referred to himself as Spot’s Dad, started out as an errand boy in an illustration studio. He then ventured into a career in advertising before creating the best-selling puppy-dog picture books. Determined to 'widen' children's perspectives, and credit them with more intelligence than adults believe, he deliberately set out to use unusual colours and unconventional objects. He moved to the United States with his family in the 1980s. He is survived by his wife Gillian, their son Christopher and his daughter Jane, all of whom are involved in continuing Spot's legacy. Diverse: The playful stories were translated into 60 languages - including Welsh - within a decade .","London-born illustrator died at home in California following short illness .

"An American doctor infected with the Ebola virus has arrived in the U.S. for treatment. A plane carrying Dr. Kent Brantly arrived in Atlanta from West Africa about 11am Saturday morning. The private jet, outfitted with a special, portable tent designed for transporting patients with highly infectious diseases, arrived at Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. Dr Brantly was then transported about 15 miles to Emory University Hospital via motorcade. News helicopter footage taken by CNN appears to show Dr Brantly - whose condition is listed as stable - being helped out of the ambulance and into the facility. Scroll down for video . Arrived: This image, taken from a CNN helicopter, appears to show Dr. Kent Brantly being helped out of an ambulance at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Saturday after arriving from Liberia in West Africa . Ebola: Seemingly uneasy on his feet, Dr Kent Brantly (left) is helped into Emory University Hospital in Atlanta by medical staff . Specially contained: Dr. Kent Brantly, one of two Americans who contracted the deadly Ebola virus while working in West Africa, landed in the U.S. Saturday and is en route to Emory University Hospital for treatment . Infection on-board: An ambulance carrying Dr. Kent Brantley, the American doctor with Ebola, departs Dobbins Air  Reserve Base on Saturday in Marietta Georgia . The hospital is fitted out with one of the most sophisticated isolation units in the country. A second patient, aid worker Nancy Writebol, is expected to arrive Monday. Brantly was able to meet with his wife, Amber, in protective conditions for 45 minutes, NBC reported. She said he was in 'great spirits and extremely grateful' to be home according to a statement released on her behalf by the Christian charity Samaritan's Purse. The doctor's sister, mother and father are also at the hospital and it was a 'relief to welcome him home', they said via the charity. U.S. officials are confident the two patients can be treated without putting the public in any danger. The . specialized unit at Emory University Hospital was opened a dozen years . ago to care for federal health workers exposed to some of the world's . most dangerous germs. Arrived: Dr. Kent Brantly, who caught Ebola at a treatment clinic in Foya, Liberia, has been evacuated to the United States for treatment . Landed: An airplane carrying American doctor Kent Brantly who has the Ebola virus, arrives at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia, on August 2, 2014 . Fight of their lives: Dr. Kent Brantly (left) and hygienist aid worker Nancy Writebol are both in grave conditions as . they battle incurable Ebola . This is a glimpse inside the containment ward at Emory University Hospital where the two American Ebola patients will be cared for after they arrive in the U.S. Now . it's being pressed into service for the two seriously ill Americans who . worked at a hospital in Liberia, one of the three West Africa countries . hit by the largest Ebola outbreak in history. CDC . Director Dr Tom Frieden acknowledged that many Americans are terrified . about bringing Dr Brantly and hygienist Writebol back to the U.S. to . continue the treatment of their incurable Ebola infections but insisted . there was no risk. 'But . I really hope that people's fear won't outweigh their compassion. We've . got a real challenge in Africa and what we need to focus on is stopping . the outbreak there. We will be able to stop it, but its going to take . supporting people,' he told CNN. 'And that means if people who are on that supporting mission get sick, we care for them.' Dr Frieden added: 'Ebola is a huge risk in Africa. It's not going to be a huge risk in the U.S.' According to WXIA, . Emory's isolation unit is on the ground floor and has three beds with . the highest standards in negative pressure air handling, HEPA filtration . and exhaust. 'When . this unit was being built, we hoped we'd never have to use the space to . treat a serious communicable disease,' said Emory epidemiologist Bruce . Ribner. Special jet: The plane carrying the two Ebola sufferers is designed to transport very ill patients long distances under constant medical care . Containment: Inside the jet, the patients will be quarantined in these isolation tents called aeromedical biological containment systems . The custom-designed jet left Atlanta for Liberia on Thursday . Efforts . have been made to help the two patients with the means available in . Liberia - and just hours before the flight to Atlanta was revealed, . father-of-two Brantly gave up the single vial of an experimental . treatment sent over from the U.S. in order that Writebol - a grandmother . and longtime Christian missionary - could receive it instead. Brantly received a transfusion of the blood of a 14-year-old Ebola . survivor who he personally helped to treat. Giving blood transfusions from . survivors to still suffering Ebola patients is an established, though . not nearly proven, treatment for the largely untreatable disease. However, on Thursday charity SIM said in a statement that Mrs Writebol's condition had worsened, despite the serum. Her husband, David, is close by but can only visit his wife through a window or dressed in a haz-mat suit. 'We . continue to pray for Nancy's full and complete recovery,' said Bruce . Johnson, president of SIM USA. 'Even though her condition has worsened, . we know she is receiving the best possible medical care, and we are . thankful that she has access to this experimental drug. 'We believe in the power of prayer and . ask people around the world not only to pray for Nancy and Kent, but . also for everyone affected by this terrible virus.' The moment CNN reported a plane was leaving the United States to pick up the American volunteers in Liberia suffering from Ebola, Twitter lit up with Americans fuming over the decision. Many were unable to understand why the patients couldn't simply be treated in Liberia. 'Is it necessary that this person come to the U.S.?  Can't this be done other there?  Ego trip?' tweeted @1ronweed. At least one of the dissenting tweets come from none other than Donald Trump. 'Ebola patient will be brought to the U.S. in a few days - now I know for sure that our  leaders are incompetent. KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!' @realDonaldTrump wrote. Donald Trump is none-too-happy with the decision to bring an Ebola patient to the US . Still others were simply thankful the patient or patients were being taken to Georgia. 'Thank god I don't live in Atlanta,' tweeted @TheMadPatriot. So should we be worried? Not if the CDC's best-there-is containment systems and procedures work as they are supposed to. The patient or patients will be housed in an area of Emory's hospital that is physically separate from other patient areas, according to CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. And inside the air will be filtered and none no staff will have any physical contact whatsoever with an infected patient outside of specialized hazmat-like suits. However, the move also comes soon after the CDC's recent string of reported mishandlings of other dangerous pathogens--namely athrax and influenza--made headlines--made headlines and even forced the resignation of the head of the government lab that potentially exposed workers to live anthrax. Dr Brantly was in West Africa with the missionary group responding to the Ebola outbreak when he was diagnosed last week. His wife and children returned to the United States before Dr Brantly showed any signs of illness. Samaritan's Purse has evacuated all of its non-essential personnel for the Ebola outbreak. Meanwhile . on Thursday, U.S. health officials warned Americans not to travel to the . three West African countries hit by an outbreak of Ebola. The . travel advisory applies to nonessential travel to Guinea, Liberia and . Sierra Leone, where the deadly disease has killed more than 700 people . this year. Father: Dr Brantly, pictured with his family, ensured Writebol received the experimental drug instead of him after a small amount arrived in Liberia, the Samaritan's Purse charity said on Wednesday . Waiting for an answer: Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, is entering a critical stage of her Ebola treatment and will either show signs of recovery or inevitable death . Last week Dr Brantly, 33, was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects. Mrs Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second. The first stage of the illness is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea. The second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body. Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red. They die an agonising death. Generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive. Mr Johnson said that SIM USA had not yet identified how Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol had become infected but said that they take ‘extreme safety measures’ and follow guidelines from the Centre For Disease Control. He said: 'Our hearts just break for them.'","Father-of-two Dr. Kent Brantly landed in Marietta, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, on Saturday morning from West Africa .

'The great thing about here is it connects - people feel part of what's going on. We are all going to die. 'There is no mystery behind it, and many of us die of cancer. My father died of cancer. Many people have got grandparents or parents with cancer. 'To have this change in the way in which it is treated from when my dad died in 1965 and now is just extraordinary. 'The word cancer wasn't used - the Big C. Now people talk about it. The thing is to make it part of all our lives and part of living and I think that's what this place achieves. 'It has just such a good atmosphere.' 'I would just like to congratulate everyone who was involved. It's the most wonderful place,' she said .

"Russia's Vladimir Putin appeared to have found his Latin rhythm during the second day of his tour of the region, as he played accordion for Argentina's President on Saturday. The Russian President, who yesterday discussed politics with Fidel Castro and agreed to wipe clean billions of dollars in Cuban debt, spent only a day in Argentina. During the visit he and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner discussed Russian investment in the country and a nuclear deal before attending a state dinner. Latin rhythms: Putin plays the accordion for Argentina's President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, during a state visit on Saturday . While at the presidential palace, Putin was pictured picking up an accordion while a delighted-looking Kirchner applauded. The pair looked relaxed in each other's company during the official dinner, where they shared a toast. Putin and Kirchner, who has been out of the public eye all week while recovering from a throat infection, were expected to use the official visit to sign a series of agreements, including cooperation on nuclear energy generation. The official Russian state visit has been geared towards improving trade ties and influence in the region, which has been mostly sympathetic or uncritical of the Ukrainian crisis. Kirchner has accused the U.S. and Britain of double standards for criticizing a pro-Russian secession . vote held in Crimea while backing a status referendum in the Falkland . Islands, claimed by Argentina. Toast: Putin and Kirchner raise their glasses during an official dinner, after meeting to discuss Russian investment . Ceremony: Kirchner leads Putin through the Presidential Palace in Buenos Aires on Saturday . However, there was some protest at the Russian involvement in Ukraine, with a crowd of about 150 gathering outside the presidential palace in Buenos Aires to protest during Putin's visit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande urged Russia this week to use its influence on rebels in eastern Ukraine so that a meeting on a possible cease-fire can take place as soon as possible. Merkel is due to watch her country's team play in the World Cup final in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, the same day Putin is expected to be in the city. As well as the protest against Russian involvement in Ukraine, several activists turned out to protest the country's anti-gay laws and prejudice. Putin last year had approved a law that banned what Moscow called gay 'propaganda' reaching children, and same-sex marriages are not recognized in Russia.

"Liberia is facing an excruciating choice - deciding which handful of Ebola patients will receive an experimental drug that could prove either life-saving or life-threatening. ZMapp, the untested Ebola drug, arrived in the West African country late yesterday. Liberia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Augustine Ngufuan, couriered the two boxes of Zmapp himself on a commercial flight from the U.S. to Monrovia, where it was unloaded at a VIP terminal. Scroll down for video . Precious cargo:  Liberian Foreign Affairs Minister Augustine Ngafuan hand-carries boxes of the experimental, untested Ebola-fighting drug ZMapp on a Delta Airlines flight from New York's JFK airport to Monrovia . Important delivery: The drug will be taken to a hospital in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, and administered to Zukunis Ireland and Abraham Borbor, two Liberian doctors who caught Ebola virus while treating patients . An airport worker carries the Zmapp from the plane: With only around 10 to 12 doses of Zmapp available, and no knowledge about the drug's potential side effects, there are difficult ethical questions to be considered . The drug is unloaded: The doctors will be the first Africans to receive the treatment, though it has already been given to a Spanish priest who later died and two U.S. aid workers who are reportedly showing signs of recovery . Assistant health minister Tolbert Nyenswah said three or four people would begin getting it today. The government has said two doctors will receive the treatment, but it was unclear who else would. These are the last known doses of ZMapp left in the world. The US-based company that developed it has said it will take months to build up even a modest supply. West Africa's Ebola virus outbreak has overwhelmed the region's already strained health systems and sparked an international debate over the ethics of giving drugs that have not yet been tested for safety or efficacy to the sick. The charity group Doctors Without Borders, which is running many of the Ebola treatment centres and whose staff have tussled with whether to provide ZMapp, said such choices present 'an impossible dilemma'. Crisis: Policemen dressed in riot gear disperse a crowd of people that blocked a main road in Monrovia after the body of someone suspected of dying from the Ebola virus was not removed by health workers . Tensions: West Africa's Ebola virus outbreak has overwhelmed the region's already strained health systems and left people living in a climate of fear and confusion over a disease that is killing half the people who get it . Now Liberian officials are facing those questions. The first Liberian patients expected to be given Zmapp will be Zukunis Ireland and Abraham Borbor, two doctors who caught Ebola virus while treating patients. 'The criteria of selection is difficult, but it is going to be done,' said Dr Moses Massaquoi, who helped Liberia obtain the drug from Mapp Biopharmaceutical. 'We are going to look at how critical people are. We are definitely going to be focusing on medical staff.' Dr Massaquoi said people who were past the 'critical phase' and looked likely to survive would not be treated with it. The World Health Organisation told Reuters only around 10 to 12 doses of the drug have been made and this raises difficult ethical questions about who should get priority access. The worst-ever outbreak of Ebola has already claimed the lives of 1,069 people and there are 1,975 probable and suspected cases, the vast majority in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the UN health agency. The doctors will be the first Africans to receive the treatment, though it has already been given to a Spanish priest who later died and two U.S. aid workers who are reported to have shown signs of recovery. Authorities are also concerned that ZMapp's unproven status could leave them open to the charge that humans are being used as guinea pigs. 'This is not the panacea to the problem. It is at the risk of the patient,' Liberia's Assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah told journalists at Monrovia's main airport. Information Minister Lewis Brown told Reuters the drug merely offered a 'glimmer of hope' and its use was little more than a gamble. A woman prays at an Evangelical Christian church in Monrovia: The worst-ever outbreak of Ebola has already claimed 1,069 lives and there are 1,975 suspected cases, mostly in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone . 'Glimmer of hope': Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown said the new drug was little more than a gamble . A boy rests as his father reads the Bible: There are mixed opinions in Liberia regarding use of Zmapp . Even so, the clamour for it is strong given that the contagious haemorrhagic disease is killing more than half of its victims and there is no known cure or vaccine. 'I welcome it. It is very good. Our nurses are dying. If you bring them the medication it will make them stronger to fight Ebola,' said stationery seller James Liburd, in Monrovia. But highlighting the dilemma, Melvin Korkor, the first Liberian doctor to survive Ebola, said he would not have used ZMapp when he was fighting for his life because U.S. authorities said they were not responsible for any adverse effects. 'Any drug that has not been approved by FDA should not be administered,' he told Reuters. And doctors treating a Sierra Leonean physician, Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, defended their decision not to give him the experimental drug, saying today they feared it was too risky. Calling it 'an impossible dilemma,' Doctors Without Borders explained in detail last month's decision in response to a New York Times story on the case. It would have been the first time the experimental drug was tried in humans but at the time that the experimental treatment was being considered for Dr Khan, his immune system was already starting to produce antibodies suggesting he might recover, Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. Dr Khan was also due to be transferred to a European hospital that would be more capable of handling problems that might arise, it said. The men in white suits: Health workers arrive to bury the body of Seidia Passawee Sherrif who succumbed to the deadly Ebola virus along with her husband Abdulah and daughter Fatu in the village of Ballajah, Liberia . Testing: Health workers take blood from Barnie Sherrif, whose parents and sister succumbed to Ebola virus. Barnie, 15, tested negative for the virus but is still shunned by his fellow villagers . The youngster shows where he sleeps: Ballajah, some 90 miles from the Liberian capital Monrovia, is at the heart of one of the quarantine zones established  in a desperate bid to try to contain the spread of Ebola virus . One of the epidemic's most tragic consequences is the toll on health care workers who have become infected themselves due to inadequate protection or diagnoses of patients that came too late or were inaccurate. The World Health Organization said this week that 170 health care workers had been infected and at least 81 had died. Another Sierra Leonean doctor, Modupeh Cole, became the latest medical practitioner to die of Ebola, a health ministry spokesman said on Tuesday. He contracted the disease after treating a patient who later proved to have the virus and died. His death followed that of Dr Khan, Sierra Leone's leading Ebola doctor, who was offered Zmapp, only for medics from Doctors Without Borders to decide no to give it to him. The experimental drug, ZMapp, is designed to boost the immune system to help it fight the virus. Since Dr Khan's body was already producing an immune response, the doctors may have feared that any boost would kick it into overdrive. In the end, the treating physicians decided against using the drug. They never told Dr Khan of its existence because they felt it would be unethical to tell him of a treatment they might not use. Shortly after their decision, however, Dr Khan's condition worsened, the statement said, and the company providing the medical evacuation decided not to transfer him. He died a few days later, on July 29. 'Every day, doctors have to make choices, sometimes difficult, about treatment for their patients,' said the Doctors Without Borders statement. 'Trying an untested drug on patients is a very difficult decision, particularly in the light of the ""do no harm"" principle.' Meanwhile, eight Chinese health workers are in quarantine in Sierra Leone because they may have contracted Ebola, according to the spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Freetown, Xu Zhou. The seven doctors and one nurse treated patients at two Chinese-run hospitals in Freetown who later died from Ebola. One of the doctors has emerged from quarantine after a 21-day observation period, Mr Zhou told Reuters. Ebola is real: A sign warning of the dangers of Ebola outside a government hospital  in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Two doctors in the country have died from the virus and eight Chinese health workers are in quarantine there . Despite the stir caused by ZMapp, preventive public health measures will be crucial to containing the outbreak, according to the U.N. health agency. As a result, West African and other governments, including some which have seen no cases of the virus, have taken measures intended to prevent the spread of the disease. Guinea-Bissau has decided to close its frontier with eastern neighbour Guinea, Prime Minister Domingos Simoes Pereira told a news conference. Germany on today urged its nationals to leave Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, though the request did not apply to medical workers or German diplomatic staff, a foreign ministry spokesman said. The outbreak has brought fresh attention to efforts to find a cure. Scientists in the U.S. studying Ebola say they have found how it blocks and disables the body's ability to battle infections in a discovery that should help the search for potential cures and vaccines. The scientists found that Ebola carries a protein called VP24 that interferes with a molecule called interferon, which is vital to the immune response. 'One of the key reasons that Ebola virus is so deadly is because it disrupts the body's immune response to the infection,' said Chris Basler of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, who worked on the study.","ZMapp drug poses ethical dilemma for authorities over who to treat .

"What happens when you drop a bowling ball and feather at the same time? The answer seems pretty obvious, with the latter falling slower due to air resistance. But in the latest episode of Human Universe Professor Brian Cox explained how, in the absence of air, both fall at the same rate owing to the laws of gravity. To prove the theory he used the world’s largest vacuum chamber, which normally tests spacecraft, to drop a bowling ball and feather from a great height in space-like conditions. Scroll down for video . In the latest episode of Human Universe Brian Cox tests the laws of gravity . To do so he travels to the Nasa Space Power Facility near Cleveland, Ohio, the world's biggest vacuum chamber, and drops a bowling ball and feathers (shown) - which fall at the same rate . The video is from the fourth episode of Brian Cox’s Human Universe, which looked at our origins and place in the universe. Professor Cox visited Nasa’s Space Power Facility near Cleveland, Ohio to investigate theories of gravity from two great scientific minds: Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. Both theorised that, in the absence of air, objects would fall to Earth at the same rate. In the 16th century Italian scientist Galileo predicted that, if two objects of different weight were dropped from a height, they would fall at the same rate owing to the law of gravity. He supposedly tested this by dropping two balls of different mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa in 1589. The following century on 5 July 1687 English physicist Sir Isaac Newton published a similar theory, his law of universal gravitation, which explained how the force of gravity attracts objects together. But on Earth there is one noticeable problem to testing these theories, namely air resistance. While objects of different weight should fall slower, using an object like a feather seems to defeat the theories as its larger surface area and low mass means it floats to the ground. But, so the theory goes, in the absence of air a feather should fall at the same rate as a bowling ball, even given the hugely different weights. In the early 20th centurty though Einstein proposed that the objects were not falling at all. Rather, if you were to replace one of the objects with, say, a person in a box, it would be impossible for the person to know they were falling. And this is what Cox concludes with his experiment: from the frame of reference from one of the falling objects in the vacuum it would be impossible to know what forces are acting. This was famously proven on the lunar surface in 1971 by Commander David Scott during the Apollo 15 mission. On the moon he dropped a feather and hammer and watched as they fell in the same time, proving that all objects fall at the same rate when air resistance and other forces do not come into play. To create an environment devoid of air, similar to the conditions encountered in space, the vacuum chamber Professor Cox visited is capable of pumping out 30 tons of air until there are just two grams (0.004lbs) left. Originally built in 1969 to test nuclear propulsion systems, the chamber is now used to test modern spacecraft - but Professor Cox used it to test this more humble although still impressive experiment. First Professor Cox raises a bowling ball and some feathers high into the chamber, before the air has been removed, and drops them to the floor. In this initial experiment the bowling ball drops straight to the ground whereas the feathers float, owing to the air resistance in the room. He alludes to the earlier experiment by Galileo that tested the same hypothesis. ‘Galileo’s experiment was simple,’ he explains. ‘He took a heavy object, and a light one, and dropped them at the same time to see which fell fastest.’ But, while Galileo’s experiment proved two similarly shaped objects would fall at the same speed despite being different weights, he didn’t have access to a vacuum chamber in the 17th Century to conduct Professor Cox's more extravagant experiment. Namely he wasn’t able to show that two objects of vastly different weight and surface area, in this case a feather and a bowling ball, would fall at the same rate. Nasa's Space Power Facility (shown) was built in the 1960s to test nuclear propulsion systems but is now usually used to test spacecraft. It was made out of aluminium to cope with the radiation but needs an outer concrete 'shell' to make sure it is strong enough to hold a vacuum inside . The Space Power Facility (SPF) was built by Nasa in 1969. At 122 feet (37.2 metres) high and 100 feet (30.5 metres) in diameter it is the world’s largest vacuum chamber. Originally used for testing nuclear propulsion systems, it has since been repurposed for modern spacecraft. In just three hours it is capable of removing almost all of the air in the 800,000 cubic-foot (22,650 cubic metres) chamber, similar to the conditions that would be encountered in space. It can also be chilled to temperatures of -160°C (-250°F). It was made out of aluminium to cope with the radiation but needs an outer concrete 'shell' to make sure it is strong enough to hold a vacuum inside. As the team gears up to perform the experiment the giant door of the chamber closes and the 800,000 cubic feet (22,650 cubic metres) of air is pumped out in a process taking three hours. ‘But once it’s complete there’s a near perfect vacuum inside,’ said Professor Cox. Standing with the control team, one of the engineers presses a button that again releases the bowling ball and feather from a height, as in the first experiment. But this time, in a moment that amazes the team that Professor Cox is with, both dramatically fall at exactly the same rate. ‘They came down exactly the same!’ exclaims one of the team with Professor Cox. ‘Holy mackerel,’ says another. Professor Cox's reasoning for conducting the experiment is not just to prove Galileo and Newton correct. It’s to prove a more interesting hypothesis put forward by Albert Einstein in the 20th century. Galileo's theory of gravity was famously proven on the lunar surface in 1971 by Commander David Scott during the Apollo 15 mission (shown). He dropped a feather and hammer and watched as they fell in the same time, proving that all objects fall at the same rate when air resistance and other forces do not come into play . ‘Isaac Newton would say that the ball and the feather fall because there’s a force pulling them down: gravity,’ he said. ‘But Einstein imagined the scene very differently. ‘The “happiest thought of his life” [as Einstein called it] was this; the reason the bowling ball and the feather fall together is because they’re not falling. ‘They’re standing still. There is no force acting on them at all. ‘He reasoned that if you couldn’t see the background, there’d be no way of knowing that the ball and the feathers were being accelerated towards the Earth. ‘So he concluded they weren’t.’ This slight tweaking of Newton’s earlier theory enabled Einstein to more accurately define his own Special Theory of Relativity. This regards the relationship between space and time but one of its conclusions is that nothing can travel faster than light. Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relavity showed how space and time interact, and also looked at the effect gravity has on the universe. It was first proposed by Einstein in 1905. Illustrated here is Nasa's Gravity Probe B spacecraft, launched in 2004 with a twin spacecraft to prove Einstein's theories . Under Newton’s theory, though, it was thought that changes in gravitational force would be instantaneous - clearly breaking the laws of physics. But Einstein proposed that the objects were not falling at all. Rather, if you were to replace one of the objects with, say, a person in a box, it would be impossible for the person to know they were falling. And this is what Cox meant with his final statement. From the frame of reference from one of the falling objects in the vacuum it would be impossible to know what forces are acting. This became known as the ‘Principle of Equivalence’ and, in essence, it showed that mass was independent from other forces like gravity. Long story short? Cox’s experiment proved the theory of gravity that Einstein called ""the happiest thought of my life”. Professor Cox showed that, in the absence of air, falling objects are essentially 'at rest' and it is not possible to know if one of the objects is moving unless there is a 'background'. Here, former Nasa astronaut Bruce McCandless II is seen floating above Earth using a special personal propulsion system in 1984 .","In the latest episode of Human Universe Brian Cox tested the laws of gravity .

"From its largest volcano to its deepest canyon, the extreme terrain of Mars can now be explored in unprecedented detail from the comfort of your desk. Taking 16 years to create, this colourful map describes the geography of Mars as it is today while also shedding light on the red planet’s watery past. It also reveals that much of the planet’s surface is older than scientists thought, with the darkest brown areas on the map formed more than four billion years ago. Taking 16 years to create, the colourful map describes the geography of Mars as it is today while also shedding light on the red planet’s past. The map was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Virginia using data from four separate orbiting spacecraft . The map was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Virginia using data from four separate orbiting spacecraft. 'Spacecraft exploration of Mars over the past couple decades has greatly improved our understanding of what geologic materials, events and processes shaped its surface,' said USGS scientist and lead author, Dr Kenneth Tanaka. 'The new geologic map brings this research together into a holistic context that helps to illuminate key relationships in space and time, providing information to generate and test new hypotheses.' This new global geologic map of Mars depicts the most thorough representation of the red planet's surface. The map reveals that much of the planet’s surface is older than scientists thought, with the darkest brown areas on the right and left map formed more than four billion years ago . Most of the surface area of the map dates to the first major geologic time period - the Early Noachian Epoch - than was previously mapped. This timeframe is the earliest part of the Noachian Period, which ranges from about 4.1 to about 3.7 billion years ago, and was characterised by high rates of meteorite impacts, widespread erosion of the Martian surface and the likely presence of abundant surface water. The map also confirms previous work that suggests Mars had been geologically active until the present day. There is evidence that major changes in Mars’ global climate supported the temporary presence of surface water and near-surface groundwater and ice. These changes were likely responsible for many of the major shifts in the environments where Martian rocks were formed and subsequently eroded. Low lying deposits, mostly 7,000 metres to 3,000 m beneath the surface are shown in green while impact craters are marked by the yellow areas doted around the planet . Lava flows and volcanos on the red planet are shown in red, purple and orange depending on when they were formed and the type of feature described. Highland areas, generally about 3,000 metres above the surface elevation, are highlighted in grey and brown . Evidence . of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in . 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons. Viking . orbiters that followed caused a revolution in ideas about water on . Mars by showing how floods carved deep valleys. Mars . is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist . on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have . been warmer and wetter in the past. In . June last year, Curiosity found Powerful evidence that water good . enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of . soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface . of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. The light blue areas show the late Amazonian polar caps. These areas are heavily pitted by impact craters, particularly in the southern polar region. Lava flows and volcanos on the red planet are shown in red, purple and orange depending on when they were formed and the type of feature described. Low lying deposits, mostly 7,000 metres to 3,000 metres beneath the surface are shown in green while impact craters are marked by the yellow areas dotted around the planet. Highland areas, generally about 3,000 metres above the surface elevation, are highlighted in grey and brown. A full explanation of the features can be found here. 'Findings from the map will enable researchers to evaluate potential landing sites for future Mars missions that may contribute to further understanding of the planet’s history,' said USGS Acting Director Suzette Kimball. 'The new Mars global geologic map will provide geologic context for regional and local scientific investigations for many years to come.' The Martian surface has been the subject of scientific observation since the 1600s, first by Earth-based telescopes, and later by fly-by missions and orbiting spacecraft.

"The legal challenge from civil liberty groups was triggered by the Edward Snowden leaks . Britain's spy agencies do harvest a ‘haystack’ of private communications by innocent people in order to target terrorist suspects, Government lawyers have admitted. GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 need to intercept the phone calls, text messages and emails to find their criminal ‘needle’, a tribunal heard. But lawyers representing intelligence chiefs said the mass surveillance was ‘lawful and appropriate’ and said claims it acted illegally were ‘outlandish’. The defence was included in legal documents submitted in a landmark challenge over the activities of the spy agencies at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). Privacy campaigners claim that safeguards surrounding GCHQ’s collection of vast quantities of online data are inadequate and do not conform to the law. Civil liberty groups have launched a legal challenge at the tribunal – which monitors whether the UK’s spying laws are being observed – over the alleged use of mass surveillance programs by the intelligence services. They allege that the agencies conduct huge surveillance sweeps that are ‘not in accordance with the law’ and breach human rights. They also claim ‘all or most’ internet and telephone communications are being routinely collected, stored and analysed, regardless of whether a person is under suspicion. The case has been brought following the leak of documents by fugitive CIA worker Edward Snowden linked to the alleged surveillance practices of GCHQ and the US National Security Agency (NSA). The legal battle centres on the alleged use of two programs – Prism and Tempora. Campaigners say Prism is a mass ‘data mining’ program used by the NSA and that information obtained was passed to the UK. Tempora is apparently used by GCHQ to intercept communications through fibre optic cables in and out of the UK. The tribunal has taken the unusual step of proceeding on the basis of a series of ‘assumed facts’ because the Government will not confirm or deny much of Snowden’s claims. An aerial view of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Benhall, Cheltenham . It has also taken the rare step of allowing the case to be heard in open court. In a written submission, James Eadie QC, for the Government, said the only way to intercept communications of a suspect was to ‘intercept a substantially greater volume of communications and then apply a selection stage to identify the communications in question’. ‘In other words, it is common ground that the only practical way to find and reconstruct most external communication “needles” is to look through the communications’ “haystack”,’ he said. Mr Eadie said privacy campaigners had based their case on ‘extreme, and at times outlandish, factual assertions about the scope, scale and nature of US and UK interception programs and intelligence sharing’. The tribunal continues.","Spy agency lawyers have admitted the organisations do harvest a 'haystack' of private communications by innocent people .

'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said. There are reports that a militant group is offering a cash reward for anyone who can give them the location of Willson. A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer's whereabouts. Brown was shot by Wilson on August 9 in Ferguson. Wilson allegedly claimed, according to his grand jury testimony which was leaked to the public, that he saw Brown and his friend Don Johnson walking down the middle of the road that day, and thought Brown matched the description of a young man involved in a recent robbery. When he tried to stop the boys, he said Brown punched him through the window. Wilson claims he then drew his weapon but Brown tried to wrestle it from him while continuing to punch him in the face. During that struggle for his gun, Wilson said he got off two shots, missing the Brown on the first and hitting him in the hand with the second. When Brown tried to escape, Wilson allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and started rushing towards him. This account is in contrast with that of several eyewitnesses, and Brown's companion Johnson, who claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.' The office of St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said that they will unseal all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following their decision and release it to the public.","Advance of a grand jury decision about whether police officer Darren Wilson will be charged in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson .

"Remarkable new images from the Rosetta spacecraft have revealed the surface of its comet like never before. In the pictures an incredible amount of detail can be spotted - including boulders on the surface and dust moving across plains. The images come as Esa prepares to attempt to land a probe on the comet in two weeks. Esa, headquartered in Paris, has released new images of Rosetta's comet (mosaic shown). They reveal fascinating details on the surface including boulders. Sand dunes can also be seen on the comet's surface . The latest images of comet 67P/C-G were taken from a distance of 9.8km from the comet’s centre and revealed in a blog post by Esa. Four new images have been released, which have been combined into one mosaic image. In those images the scale is about 26 inches (66 cm) per pixel. The mosaic covers about 3,940 to 4,430ft (1,200 to 1,350 metres) on the comet’s surface. Towards the upper left of the image is an area of bright material that was cast in shadow in previous images, possibly at the base of a cliff. A recent landslide of sorts may have uncovered this material. Esa adds though that the brightness of the images is a little bit misleading, as the comet is actually blacker than coal. In order to make features visible the images are grey-scaled and also set to a high contrast to make them appear brighter. It's thought some sort of landslide may have revealed bright material seen at the bottom of this image under what appears to be a cliff. This image and the next three were used to make he mosaic . Esa is preparing to attempt to land a probe called Philae on the comet in two weeks . The images also take another look at a pyramid-like rock on the comet. This was named Cheops by Esa after the pyramid on Earth. It is seen here as the largest boulder just left and down of the centre . Esa adds though that the brightness of the images is a little bit misleading, as the comet is actually blacker than coal. In order to make features visible the images are grey-scaled and also set to a high contrast to make them appear brighter . 'Also not seen previously in this much detail are the two boulders just below the centre of the mosaic, one of which takes on a heart-shaped appearance from this angle,' Space Science Editor Emily Baldwin write for Esa on the blog. 'Zooming in reveals hints of a layered structure and both objects seems to be appearing from beneath the dusty layer, just like some of the smaller ‘boulders’ around them.' Within the images can also be seen a mysterious pyramid-shaped rock that was previously spotted by Esa. It can be seen just above the middle in the mosaic. At around 82ft-tall (25 metres), the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history. Boulder Cheops, taken by Rosetta’s OSIRIS camera on 19 September , from a distance of 17.7 miles (28.5km) In this image released on 18 October, meanwhile, sand dunes can be seen drifting down the centre . The 'pyramid' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of 67P/C-G's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at Giza near Cairo in Egypt. Esa named the structure Cheops, after the largest of those pyramids, the Great Pyramid, which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Cheops around 2550 BC. Rosetta has spent 10 years chasing down comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and is now in orbit around the 'ice mountain', edging in closer to its surface each day. For a sense of scale, the comet is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings. The 'pyramid' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of 67P/C-G's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at Giza near Cairo in Egypt . A patchwork of images of comet 67P from a distance of 10.5 miles (16.9km) from the centre of the comet . Rosetta took an incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible . As Rosetta continues to survey and monitor the comet's surface in the next months, the scientists will be looking for clues to better explain the formation of the comet. Last month a 2.4 mile-wide (4km) region on the 'head' of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of Rosetta's Philae probe. The high-risk manoeuvre on November 12, if successful, will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet. Scientists at mission control in Germany hope the spider-like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of Earth's water and perhaps even life. But they've warned that the landing should be seen as an 'exciting extra' on the Rosetta mission as the mission carries a 'high risk'. The recent decision that the mission is 'go' for Site J confirms the timeline of events leading up to the landing of Philae on Rosetta. Rosetta will release Philae at 08:35 GMT/09:35 CET on 12 November at a distance of approximately 14 miles (22.5km) from the centre of the comet. The landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 GMT/16:30 CET. During the seven-hour descent, Philae will take images and conduct science experiments, sampling the dust, gas and plasma environment close to the comet. It will take a 'farewell' image of the Rosetta orbiter shortly after separation, along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface. It is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on Earth several hours after separation. Once safely on the surface, Philae will take a panorama of its surroundings. Again, this is expected back on Earth several hours later. The first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours, constrained by the lander's primary battery lifetime. Longer-term study of the comet by Philae will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge, which in turn is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels. In any case, it is expected that by March 2015, as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the Sun, temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations, and Philae's science mission will come to an end. The Rosetta orbiter's mission will continue for much longer. It will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer Solar System. The reconstructed-colour image indicates how dark the comet really appears. On average, the comet's surface reflects about four per cent of impinging visible light, making it as dark as coal .

"A Chinese man kidnapped his pregnant 21-year-old girlfriend, tied a gas tank to her back and ignited when police turned up to try and rescue her. Li Moulian, 36, dragged Xu Fan, 21, out of her bed and bundled her into the back of his car before carrying out the vicious attack in Huizhou City of Guangdong Province, southern China. The pair ended up side-by-side in hospital beds as surgeons battle to save their lives, but, despite the mother-to-be's horrific injuries, her unborn baby managed to survive. She fell pregnant by mistake after a one-night-stand, but the pair decided to stay together and moved into to a house in Mazhuang New Village. Brutal: Mother-to-be Xu Fan, 21, (pictured on the floor) suffered severe burns after her boyfriend attached a gas canister to her back and ignited it. Fire: The tank was ignited while the couple were in a car, driving away from their home in Guandong Province in South China . Injured: Li Moulian, 36, suffered more serious injuries in the attack on his girlfriend . Sixth months into the relationship, the pressure seems to have been too much for the father-to-be. Moulian attacked Fan while she was asleep and dragged her out of her bed, telling her he planned to kill her. He bundled her into the car and drove around the town before police were able to spot him. They also received calls from disturbed neighbours who saw the young woman being dragged across the street. The girl was pulled from the car by police, but officers were forced to extinguish flames on her body. Both the man and women suffered life-threatening burns and were taken to hospital. The pair ended up in the same operating room side-by-side as surgeons worked to save the lives. Scene: Moulian ignited the tank in the back seat of a car after dragging his girlfriend from her bed in the middle of the night . Treatment: The couple lay side-by-side in a Chinese hospital suffering from serious burns . Traumatised: The injured pregnant woman stares at a heart rate monitor after the vicious attack . After rescuing the girl and extinguishing the blaze, police then rescued the man who suffered more severe burns as a result, and who is not expected to survive. The young woman's family said they had warned her against getting involved too quickly with Li Moulian, from Lufeng City located in the southeast of Guangdong Province. Her uncle Wu Chin, 47, said: 'We had warned her that she needed to know more about him before deciding to spend her life with him, it seems sadly the warnings were true as he clearly has mental problems. 'To suddenly accuse her in the middle of the night trying to kill his parents shows he is obviously severely paranoid. 'It is a bad start in life for the child as well with the father having obvious mental problems.' Police spokesman Tao Hou, 36, said: 'As . the police car with a siren approached the car with the man and woman . inside, and another blocked off its escape route from the rear, the man . ignited something in the car which exploded into flames.'","Xu Fan, 21, had a one night stand with Li Moulian, 36 six months ago .

"The script in Lewis Hamilton’s head prior to qualifying surely placed him on pole position, his esteem restored, on the testing ground of true racers at Spa-Francorchamps. But in the slipping, sliding wet of this Saturday afternoon it was his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg wearing the broad smile of the fastest man. Hamilton, who was two-tenths of a second behind after struggling with a brake problem, was gloomy in his immediate press dealings. He will start today’s Belgian Grand Prix from second on the grid – a handy place to be, according to history. Only six of the last 14 pole-sitters have converted their advantage into victory. Hamilton himself was overtaken at the start when on pole here last year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch . Top three: Nico Rosberg (centre), Lewis Hamilton (right) and Sebastian Vettel will be the front three at Spa . Results: The top 10 and their Q3 times in qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix . Pole position: Rosberg qualified fastest to finish on pole for the Belgian Grand Prix . Those facts are comforts for Hamilton, but it must still have hurt like hell to see Rosberg dominate him through the Ardennes hills, of all places. Yes, Rosberg is clever and thoughtful, a percentage player, but he is not meant to be Hamilton’s equal, let alone better, over a flying lap on a proper track like this – at 4.3 miles the longest in Formula One and home to such legendary corners as Blanchimont, Pouhon and Eau Rouge. Nor is this a one off. Rosberg has now taken seven poles this season compared to Hamilton’s four. Some of the Briton’s disappointments were the result of ill-luck – notably, a fireball at Hungary last time out and brake failure a week earlier in Germany. Despite Mercedes being exceptionally fast, he has not been on pole since the Spanish Grand Prix in mid-May. He complained afterwards of a ‘glazed’ front left brake destabilising the car. ‘This is a circuit where you have to have confidence in the brakes,’ said Hamilton. ‘You could see when I was going straight on as the left brake wasn’t working for some reason. I don’t know why. ‘It went into glazing. When it glazes it is very hard to recover. You have to put the brake balance forward. It’s not that easy to clear it.’ It takes a good rub to fix the problem. That will be done overnight, meaning his brakes should work perfectly when the lights go out today. ‘I am not disappointed,’ said Hamilton, contrarily given his miserable body language and flat tone. But remembering how Vettel breezed past him on the straight last season, he added: ‘Second place is the best place to start here so I feel quite blessed.’ Hamilton is right not to think his chances of victory are over, given the Houdini acts he has performed on a number of recent Sundays from way down the field. As Rosberg said: ‘In the end I was really feeling comfortable and able to push, but it is only qualifying, so there is still a long race to go. ‘This is one of the most special tracks of the year, so to be in front is great.’ Second: Whilst his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton will start the race in second . Edged out: It means the Brit will have it all to do at Spa on Sunday . The conditions were typical of Spa, a place for which the word ‘capricious’ could have been invented. Rain, sun, cloud, cold, warmth all blew in and out as the afternoon progressed. About 40 minutes before qualifying started the heaviest of the rain started, trapping team principals in the Mercedes motorhome, where they had met for private talks. Marussia team principal John Booth was the first to brave the conditions, without an umbrella. He’s from Yorkshire and has seen worse. Others cowered in the doorway. The track was still wet when the cars started, and rain fell again just after the first session had finished. By then, Hamilton had delivered one tetchy exchange over the radio. Urged to keep pushing – what else would he be doing? – he snapped back: ‘Please don’t speak to me on my lap.’ He only had to push against one man, in fact, such was the total dominance of the Silver Arrows: Sebastian Vettel, of Red Bull, and Fernando Alonso, of Ferrari, were third and fourth fastest yet more than two seconds behind Rosberg. The other Brits had disappointing days. Jenson Button, so often a master in tricky conditions, was only 10th quickest, three places behind his McLaren team-mate Kevin Magnussen, while Max Chilton was 19th, more than a second a half behind the other Marussia of Jules Bianchi. Third: Whilst Red Bull driver Vettel will start off from third on the grid . As for tomorrow’s race, the two Mercedes men will be allowed to race free of team orders. That is the commitment made to them after the confusion of the Hungarian Grand Prix four weeks ago, when Hamilton was asked to let Rosberg through but did not (there were extenuating circumstances). Toto Wolff, Mercedes’ executive director, admitted the situation had needed ‘mediating, management, caressing and hard words’. Should Hamilton lose out today, and slip further than 11 points behind Rosberg, there may well need for more of the same.","Rosberg beats team-mate Hamilton into second in qualifying at Spa .

"The investigation into the Brett Favre sexting scandal was deliberately drawn out by the NFL, the former manager of ex-hostess Jenn Sterger has alleged. The former quarterback allegedly sent inappropriate messages and nude photographs to Miss Sterger, who was working as a New York Jets game-day hostess, in 2008. The 44-year-old married NFL legend admitted leaving voicemails for Miss Sterger, but denied sending lewd selfies, and was fined $50,000 by the NFL for a 'failure to cooperate' with the investigation. Accusations: The former manager of Jenn Sterger, left, is accusing the NFL of deliberately delaying the investigation into alleged lewd images sent to the New York Jets hostess by Brett Favre, right . Now, Miss Sterger’s former manager Phil Reese is accusing the NFL of deliberately delaying the investigation in order to avoid a lawsuit and 'minimize the impact of any negative PR'. ‘Just like Brett Favre’s penis (allegedly), it wasn’t pretty. But unlike Brett Favre’s penis (allegedly), it was extremely long,’ he writes in a column on the investigation. The alleged messages were to have been send in 2008 when both Miss Sterger and Mr Favre were employed by the New York Jets. However, it was not until October 2010 that the ‘sexts’ emerged when website Deadspin posted a video that included text messages and voicemails allegedly left by the quarterback for Miss Sterger, including one in which he invites her to his hotel. The video ended with several below-the belt photos - said to be of Favre - which were allegedly sent to Miss Sterger. Tarnished: The 44-year-old quarterback, who retired from football in 2010, was fined $50,000 by the NFL for a 'failure to cooperate' with the investigation into his lewd messages . Miss Sterger denied leaking the messages, and cooperated fully with the investigation by the NFL, which was not concluded until the end of December. The NFL claimed the investigation had been dragged out because of difficulties in setting up interviews with 'certain key individuals,' the complication of retrieving and reviewing electronic records. However, Mr Reese, claims is was dragged out to avoid a lawsuit. ‘The statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit in New Jersey would have expired at the end of December 28th, 2010, two years from the last day of the 2008 season, when Favre and Sterger were both employed by the Jets,’ he writes in a column obtained by Page Six. ‘And when did the league announce their ruling? On December 29th, 2010. ‘All of the “investigating” that took place wasn’t because they wanted to properly enforce the personal conduct policy, but to gather as much information as possible so that the league could avoid liability and minimize the impact of any negative PR that could tarnish the shield. Miss Sterger appears in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos in 2011 where she denied accusations that she was a 'gold-digger', and claimed that she made no financial profit from the 2010 scandal . ‘The league’s personal conduct policy has nothing to do with a player’s actual conduct and everything to do with protecting the league’s business interests.’ Following their investigation, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell 'could not conclude' that Favre violated the league's personal conduct policy based on the evidence currently available to him. A statement released after the ruling said: 'The forensic analysis could not establish that Favre sent the objectionable photographs to Sterger. 'The review found no evidence to contradict the statements of both Favre and Sterger that they never met in person, nor was there anything to suggest that Sterger engaged in any inappropriate conduct.' Favre, a grandfather-of-one, retired in 2010 after 20 years in the NFL, having played quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, Green Bay Packers, New York Jets, and Minnesota Vikings.","Brett Favre was accused of sexting Jets hostess Jenn Sterger in 2010 .

"While you may think badges and posters honouring celebrities are a reasonably recent idea, they were in fact being produced more than 200 years ago. In an age where men at sea rather than singers, actors and athletes were the stars of the day, there was still plenty of money to be made in merchandise. From pipes to badge-like discs, entrepreneurs began to produce memorabilia of one of the 18th and 19th century’s biggest celebrities - Navy heroes. Frenetic battle: The Fall of Nelson, Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805, by Denis Dighton in 1825. On the right, Nelson is portrayed at the moment he falls on his left side. Captain Hardy, with his back to the viewer, advances to assist Royal Marine Sergeant Secker, who is already at Nelson's side on HMS Victory . Memorabilia: A mug is pictured left with a black and white portrait of Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, inscribed above 'England Expects every Man to do his Duty', from 1806. On the right, there is a metal disc from 1740, decorated with a depiction of another Navy hero, Admiral Edward Vernon, facing to the left with a ship behind him . These pictures show how as well as . being painted into now-famous pieces of artwork, the likes of Admiral Lord . Nelson were celebrated in merchandise. Also recognised in a metal disc was . Admiral Vernon, who in 1739 captured Portobello from the Spanish - and was a precursor to Nelson's celebrity status. A remarkable collection at the . National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, south-east London, is showing how . sea-faring heroes became British celebrities. The exhibition looks at how the Navy shaped the course of British history in a period when it became a . greater focus of public life than ever before. Spectacular: The 'Royal George' at Deptford Showing the Launch of the 'Cambridge' by John Cleveley the Elder, in 1757. This picture is a composite of two events, set at Deptford, combining the launch of the 'Cambridge', on October 21 1755 with a view of the 'Royal George', 100 guns, which was in reality launched a year later at Woolwich Dockyard. The painting shows considerable shipping detail and activities on the quayside, with a variety of small open craft, some clearly bearing official parties . Old and young: On the left is Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson by Lemuel Francis Abbott in 1799. It is a half-length portrait depicting Nelson when he was a rear-admiral, facing forward with his head turned to the left. On the right is Captain Horatio Nelson by John Francis Rigaud in 1781. Although the portrait was begun in 1777, when Nelson was a lieutenant, it was not finished until at least 1781 when he had returned to England as a captain . James Davey, the museum's naval history curator, told MailOnline: ‘The 18th century was a period when Britain was at war more often than at peace. 'The Navy rose to unprecedented popularity across the nation' James Davey, naval history curator . ‘The Navy rose to unprecedented . popularity across the nation. When you're talking about the Navy in this . period, you're talking about a national endeavour. ‘It's not just the 140,000 who served . in it in its height in the 1810s. There were also thousands working in . the dockyard, farms, forests and mines. ‘We want to show how the Navy has . shaped the lives of British people. In times of victory, the Navy was . celebrated and people like Nelson were heroes. Below deck: The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805, by Arthur William Devis. The exhibition Nelson, Navy, Nation explores the Navy’s impact upon ordinary people while also providing a setting for the National Maritime Museum’s huge collections relating to Admiral Lord Nelson . Remembering a hero: On the left, a plaster-life mask of Nelson from circa 1800, with his eyes open and hair parted in centre. The hair was added by modelling. It was for many years believed to be a death mask but there is no contemporary reference to a mask being taken after Nelson's death. On the right, is a prattware pipe from circa 1798, modelled as a half length figure of Nelson. His right arm is missing, and he wears a uniform coat, waistcoat and ruffled shirt . ‘We can show how people across Britain . brought the Navy into their homes, using ceramics to decorate their . bedrooms and dining rooms.’ Mr Davey added of the metal disc . commemorating Admiral Vernon: ‘Vernon's victory (at Portobello) basically turned him into a national celebrity. ‘It's like a football poster on a . wall. This is happening just a time in Britain where consumer goods like . this are becoming cheaper. ‘You might have clipped it to your . clothing, so it was a public way of displaying not only your affections . for this leader, but also displaying your patriotism.’ Astonishing: Extirpation of the Plagues of Egypt; - Destruction of Revolutionary Crocodiles; - or - The British Hero cleansing ye mouth of ye Nile by James Gillray; H. Humphrey, 1798. This celebrates Nelson's resounding victory over the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Nelson stands in the mouth of the river capturing and culling tri-coloured crocodiles. The biblical plagues of Egypt of the title are transformed into crocodiles, which stand in turn for the French ships taken or destroyed . Shooting practice: A Sea Service pistol from circa 1790 is pictured left. And a cut paper picture commemorating Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson from circa 1806 is seen right. The inscription reads: 'This the Great Warrier [sic] after all his Toil [pair of hearts and doves]/From Whom whilst living none could take the spoile,/,Dropt is his prime and made the Grave his Bed [heart and arrows] / Whom late all Nations did both love and Dread / The ever to be lamented death of Vice admiral lord viscount Nelson' Also in the collection was a Nelson . pipe produced following the Battle of the Nile. Mr Davey said: ‘In 1798, . people had known about Nelson before. 'People across Britain brought the Navy into their homes, using ceramics to decorate their bedrooms and dining rooms' James Davey, naval history curator . ‘But the Battle of the Nile was the . first one he had commanded a fleet and won. This is what turned him into . a national celebrity. ‘So you get an incredible range of . weird and wonderful goods. The likeness isn't particularly accurate, but . it's the kind of thing that a middle-class person would love.’ One of the star attractions of the . exhibition - called Nelson, Navy, Nation and opening on Trafalgar Day, . October 21 2013 - is a painting by Denis Dighton. The Fall of Nelson, from the Battle of . Trafalgar on October 21 1805, painted in 1825, portrays the moment when . Nelson was fatally shot. Artefacts: A full-length figurehead is pictured left, depicting a heraldic crowned lion, holding a small badge of the cross of Saint George at the breast. This is a rare survival of a standard Royal Naval lion figurehead from a small warship probably of the fourth or fifth rate. On the right is a heart-shaped earthenware scent bottle, transfer-printed in pink with a profile portrait of Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson . Posed up: Captain Lord George Graham, 1715-47, in his Cabin, by William Hogarth in 1742-44. Graham is shown at dinner with his civilian secretary and companion. The singer between them is accompanied by a servant playing a fife and drum . The battle saw a fleet of 27 ships . led by Nelson on HMS Victory defeat 33 French and Spanish ships off . south-west Spain, near Cape Trafalgar. Nelson was famously killed in the . battle, while his French counterpart, Admiral Villeneuve, was captured . along with the French flagship Bucentaure. Mr Davey, 30, said: ‘Nelson's tactics at Trafalgar ensured there would be a decisive outcome - but a fierce fight. ‘This painting, which was probably . painted about 20 years after the battle, shows Nelson being hit by a . French musket ball and falling to the deck. ‘Nelson is subsequently carried below . deck where he slowly dies. This painting also gives a wonderful insight . into the frenetic aspect of fighting at sea.'","Exhibition reveals how Admiral Lord Nelson and Admiral Vernon were celebrated through unusual memorablia .

"Sarah Palin found a novel way to turn down an interview request from Piers Morgan on Friday, posting a picture on Facebook of a bear she had shot dead and a note saying she was busy. The former Alaska governor thanked chat show host Morgan for inviting her on his 'shambolic show' but added she was 'kind of busy right now'. The Facebook message, which had been liked by nearly 3,000 of Palin's supporters within two hours of it being posted, is part of an online spat between the pair after Morgan poked fun at her intellect. Thanks but no thanks: Sarah Palin used this picture of her with a bear she shot to send a message to Piers Morgan . Earlier in the week the host of Piers Morgan Live tweeted 'And she's back' and linked to a satirical article from the Daily Currant claiming Palin believed Jesus had celebrated Easter. According to conservative website Breitbart, Morgan was 'gleefully tweeting out a Currant story attacking Sarah Palin, without noting that the story was untrue'. Palin linked to the Breitbart article and, in another twist of the knife, added in her Facebook message: 'And to all our British friends: we ask, what did your friends across the pond ever do to you to deserve your Piers?' Feud: Palin was hitting back at Piers Morgan after he tweeted a link to a satirical article that poked fun at the former governor . Tweets: Morgan gave a tongue-in-cheek response to Palin turning down his interview request . Morgan was quick to respond to the picture, tweeting: 'Un-bear-able' before adding: 'Being called 'shambolic' by @SarahPalinUSA is most amusing. I wonder if she can see irony from her house?' The tweet was in reference to a Saturday Night Live skit of Palin during her vice-presidential campaign in 2008, when comedian Tina Fey, playing the Alaska governor, said: 'I can see Russia from my house'. Morgan has added that the invitation for Palin to appear on his show still stood.","Former governor refuses invite to go on 'shambolic' Piers Morgan Live show .

"Celtic seem set to reject a plea from Legia Warsaw to have a meeting to decide which club should progress to the Champions League play-off round.

"The Barclays Premier League returned with a bang over the weekend, with spectacular goals, thrilling football, moments of controversy and some late drama. We've watched all of the 26 goals again - with a little help from our friends at Opta - and here's the full breakdown of how they were scored. PAYING THE PENALTY . The opening weekend saw three penalties awarded in the 10 games, with one scored and two missed. Saido Berahino slotted home to open the scoring for West Brom against Sunderland after referee Neil Swarbrick had adjudged Valentin Roberge to have tangled a little too closely with Victor Anichebe. Going down: Victor Anichebe fell under contact from Sunderland defender Valentin Roberge, leading referee Neil Swarbrick to award West Brom a penalty . Spot on: Saido Berahino confidently converts the penalty, sending Vito Mannone the wrong way . Out of character: Mark Noble missed his penalty for West Ham against Tottenham . At Upton Park, Mark Noble fired wide from 12 yards - his first penalty miss in 10 - as West Ham went down 1-0 to Tottenham in the London derby. And Charlie Austin had a Premier League debut to forget when Allan McGregor saved his spot-kick at Loftus Road. There were three penalty goals on the opening day last season and five the season prior to that. SET-PIECE SPECIALISTS . They are the spectacular goals that get us on our feet, but there were no goals direct from free-kicks on the opening weekend. This is in contrast to last season's first weekend, when two were scored - Frank Lampard rifled home for Chelsea against Hull and Yaya Toure curled one in for Man City against Newcastle. Some came close, like Wayne Rooney, who curled one against the outside of the post in Manchester United's defeat by Swansea, or the fan who ran 70 yards across the pitch to take one at Upton Park. So close: Wayne Rooney struck the outside of the post with this free-kick in Man United's loss to Swansea . Good effort: A fan runs on to the pitch to take a free-kick during the West Ham vs Tottenham game . INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE BOX . The vast majority of the weekend's goals (24) were tucked away from inside the penalty box, with just two scored from outside. This is a low count compared to recent form - there were six long-range hits on the opening day last season and five the year before that. It perhaps demonstrates a trend of working the ball into the box with passing, rather than shooting from range. There was Lee Cattermole's superb 25-yard strike for Sunderland at West Brom and Ki Sung-yeung's curled effort from just outside the area to give Swansea the lead at Old Trafford. Fine strike: Lee Cattermole lets fly with a 25 yard shot to open the scoring for Sunderland at West Brom . Cool finish: Ki Sung-yeung curls the ball home to put Swansea ahead at Old Trafford . HEADERS . The opening round saw three headed goals and, in a trend that maybe shows the decline of high crossing in favour of passing moves and all of them came from set-piece situations. At Loftus Road, Hull defender James Chester won a battle of strength with Rio Ferdinand to head home Stephen Quinn's corner and settle the contest. The other two came 10 minutes apart at the Emirates - Brede Hangeland was left unmarked to meet a Jason Puncheon corner and give Crystal Palace the lead, before Laurent Koscielny bent his run to get in behind the defence and nod in Alexis Sanchez's free-kick to equalise. Four headed goals were scored this time last year. Heading for victory: James Chester (right) beats QPR defender Rio Ferdinand to the ball and score . Towering: Brede Hangeland rises above the Arsenal defence to head Crystal Palace in front on Saturday . Twist: Laurent Koscielny scores with his head to bring Arsenal level at the Emirates . WHICH FOOT? 16 of the 26 came with the right foot and seven with the left. Both of Swansea's goals came off the left boot, Ki sweeping home and Gylfi Sigurdsson slotting home the late winner. Eric Dier also slotted home after rounding goalkeeper Adrian to score Tottenham's late winner at West Ham. On the left: Eric Dier rounds West Ham keeper Adrian to score Tottenham's winner at Upton Park . PASSING STATS . The weekend underlined once again how English football's top flight has thrown aside the traditional long ball game in favour of short and precise passing. 87.48 per cent of attempted passes in the 10 matches were short - 7,951 in total - with just 1,138 over a longer range. This stat has remained consistently in the high eighties for the last three or four seasons now. The best example was, of course, Andre Schurrle's magnificent goal for Chelsea at Burnley. This comprised 23 passes, working the ball from one end of the pitch to the other, before Cesc Fabregas played the final killer ball into Schurrle to finish with aplomb. Team work: Andre Schurrle's goal for Chelsea at Burnley featured 24 passes in the build-up . Cool finish: The German gets on the end of Cesc Fabregas' defence-splitting ball to score . Back to front: Our Match Zone diagram showing the intricate passing for Schurrle's goal . VIDEO Positive reaction a plus for Mourinho . TOTAL GOALS . The 26 goals scored is one more than this time last year but some way short of the 33 racked up on the opening weekend of the 2006-2007 season, helped by Man United's 5-1 thrashing of Fulham and Reading's 3-2 home win over Middlesbrough. The lowest in the last decade came in 2011-2012 with just 18 scored and three goalless draws.","The opening weekend of the season saw 26 goals scored in Premier League .

Stawicki's victims in the café included God's Favourite Beefcake band members Joe 'Vito' Albanese, 52, and his bandmate and best friend Drew Keriakedes, 45. The other two victims were a man and a woman, taken to Harborview Medical Center where they later died. They have not yet been named. Half an hour after these shootings, . Stawicki fatally shot Gloria Leonidas, a married mother-of-two in a . parking lot near to Town Hall before fleeing in her black Mercedes SUV. Leaving . the SUV at the side of the road in West Seattle, Stawicki was . apprehended by a plain clothed police officer who called for back-up at . around 4pm. When . the police moved in to arrest Stawicki he knelt on the floor and shot . himself in the head and was then taken to Harborview where he later . died. Stawicki's brother Andrew, 29, of Ellensburg, told the Seattle Times that when he saw . a surveillance photo on the news of the alleged gunman inside Cafe Racer he . recognised it as his brother.

He said his brother had been suffering from mental illness, adding: 'It's no surprise this happened. We could see this coming. Nothing good is going to come with that much anger inside of you.' 'When I was little, he would take me to punk rock concerts and big . brother things. He was great.' But over the past five or so years, he said he changed. He added: 'Angry. He was really angry toward everything. And his father Walt told ABC News that his son, a regular at the coffee shop where his rampage began, was a 'very private person'. He said: 'He was happy sometimes, but not really. He was kind of disgruntled.' He also revealed that his son had a girlfriend but was not married, had no children, and had recently worked on a fishing processing boat in Alaska. The two separate shooting incidents in Seattle on Wednesday . set off an extensive city-wide manhunt and forced officials to . close nearby schools.

'It's . the strangest place to think of a shooting,' said Hill, who heard four . to five shots.  He said he ran to his balcony and called 911, but didn't . see a suspect. In the last month alone, there have been two random killings in the city. Last . week, a man died when a stray bullet struck him as he and his family . drove down a Seattle street. In late April, a woman died of injuries . suffered in an apparently random drive-by shooting near downtown. No arrests have been made in either of those fatalities.

GANG members were intercepted by police yesterday as they made their way to Notting Hill Carnival intent on violence. The mob of 36 men, some of them wearing body armour, were stopped at King's Cross Tube station in central London following a tip-off. Witnesses say ten police vans and officers with dogs swooped to arrest the suspects who came from North London. Last night 15 of the men were being detained to prevent a 'potential breach of the peace'. The huge police operation came after the biggest street party in Europe was again marred by violence. Last night a man was fighting for his life following a triple stabbing. The 35-year-old was knifed outside a pub in North Kensington in a large brawl on Sunday night that saw two other men receive blade wounds. Detectives arrested two men aged 22 and 27 at the scene on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and later re-arrested them on suspicion of attempted murder. A 20-year-old man was knifed in the back and buttocks in the middle of the carnival at 5.50pm on Sunday. The number of arrests over the three-day weekend stood last night at 147, mainly for drugs, public order offences, robbery and assault. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said the figure was not surprising for an event attended by a 1million people in a single day. He drafted in an extra 2,000 police officers yesterday, bringing the total on duty at the carnival to 7,000. Care . assistant Michaela Popescu, 30, from Ashford, Kent, joined in the fun . with her friend's twin daughters Victoria and Theadora Trosheva, seven. 'It has been a brilliant day, the music is fantastic - I can feel the rhythm in my heart,' she said. 'The girls have had a lot of fun and been dancing along, it's a totally different culture for them to enjoy.' Police overseeing the festival were hoping for a peaceful climax to the Notting Hill . Carnival today, despite at least two stabbings. Yesterday's . festivities were largely peaceful but one 20-year-old man was left in a . serious but stable condition after being stabbed in the back and . buttocks in Ladbroke Grove. Metropolitan Police said a 14-year-old boy was slashed with a sharp object in Golborne Gardens. And a 16-year-old girl was also treated but discharged herself from hospital after sustaining what police described as a superficial leg wound in Wornington Road. An extra 2,000 police officers will be drafted in to support the event today, bringing the total to 7,000. Scotland Yard arrested 96 people yesterday, mainly for drug and public order offences as well as robbery and assault. Officers have been granted stop and . search powers within the area where the carnival takes place, while the . force has advised visitors to only use mobile phones when absolutely . necessary. Commander Christine Jones said: 'Mobile phones, especially expensive ones, are a glittering prize for thieves. 'Don't give them a head start by . displaying them openly and only use them if it's absolutely necessary. Pick up one of our maps instead and pre-arrange meeting points with . family and friends.' Three men were stabbed in a fight in North Pole Road - close by but outside the carnival's footprint. Scotland Yard said two men were arrested and one was left in a critical condition and confirmed there were 152 arrests yesterday. A spokesman said: ""This is broadly in line with what we expected. To give you an idea, on Bank Holiday Monday last year we made 172 arrests."" A Scotland Yard spokesman later said the number of people stopped by police at Kings Cross underground station this afternoon was 36, not 34. Of the group - all males - 17 were aged 18 or over and nineteen aged under 18, he said. All were arrested and were being held at an undisclosed location until police were satisfied there was no longer a risk they would commit disorder at the carnival.

"A MYSTERY disease killing dogs across the country continues to claim victims and baffle vets. Nearly 50 pets of various breeds are feared to have contracted it in the last 18 months, with 21 dying. Symptoms include skin lesions on the legs and chest, lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting. Within days, the illness attacks the kidneys, often leading to a long drawn-out death. Mapped: Where the killer disease has struck . Half of the confirmed cases have centred around the New Forest in Hampshire, although others have occurred as far afield as Yorkshire, Cornwall, Worcestershire, County Durham, Surrey and Dorset. The latest casualty is Tegan, a three-year-old fox terrier cross, who died after walking near Ashurst in the New Forest. Owner Sarah Thairs, of North Baddesly, Hampshire, took her to the vet but her  condition worsened and Tegan died late last month. ‘My poor little girl had been through so much,’ she said. ‘Tests showed the disease had gone to her pancreas. I had to make the decision to put her down, which is heartbreaking.’ Another victim was Summer, an 11-year-old Weimaraner owned by Angela Larder. The latest casualty was Tegan, pictured, a three-year-old fox terrier cross, who died after walking at the Deerleap enclosure near Ashurst in the New Forest. Owner Sarah Thairs, from North Baddesly near Romsey took her dog to the vets last month but they couldn't stop her condition deteriorating . The pet died two weeks after the nurse and her boyfriend had a break in Brockenhurst in the New Forest. ‘We had to make the excruciating decision to put her to sleep,’ said Miss Larder. ‘It was the most difficult thing to do. She was old but healthy. The hardest part was watching her die day by day. ‘I still feel guilt and responsibility that our weekend break ended in her death. Experts have been left perplexed by the outbreak, but think the disease is similar to Alabama Rot. Alabama . Rot is the common name for diopathic renal glomerular vasculopathy, a . disease which surfaced in greyhounds in Alabama in the 1980s. It is believed to be caused by a rare form of E.coli. The earliest signs of Alabama rot are skin lesions on the legs, chest and abdomen that spread across the skin. These symptoms then develop into liver failure, and death. Vet David Walker said the recent pathogen is the same as that found in Alabama. It is a disease of the blood vessels that leads to cell death and affects the dog's skin and kidneys. Common symptoms are the dog losing its appetite, becoming unusually quiet and vomiting. ‘I can’t even think about  getting another dog but if the time ever comes, I know I will never, ever walk my dog in a  forest again. I couldn’t take that chance with an animal’s life.’ John Tricker’s border collie Barney, eight, was also struck down by the disease after he walked him in the forest at Latchmore Brook, Hampshire. Mr Tricker, 59, a car salesman, said: ‘Barney was my friend, my partner and defender. ‘I whispered in his ear that I loved him more than anything in the world as the vet put him to sleep and he still wagged his tail. I miss him and will never  forget him.’ Vets point to similarities with Alabama Rot, a disease first reported in greyhounds in the US in the 1980s. It is believed to be caused by a rare form of the E.coli bacteria. he investigation into the illness has been led by vet David Walker since it emerged in 2012. ‘We know the pathogen is the same as that in Alabama Rot,’ he said ‘It is a disease of the  blood vessels that leads to cell death. ‘We don’t know what the trigger for the disease is, which makes it very hard to treat or advise on the best action. ‘There is no pattern among the dogs which have died.’ He added there was no evidence that owners should avoid a specific area as there have been cases around the country. There have been 24 confirmed cases plus 24 unconfirmed. Some dogs have survived and the  disease does not appear to pass from animal to animal. The lives of Summer, a Weimaraner, (left) and Barney, a collie, (right) were both taken by the disease. Summer died two weeks after being taken on a break to the New Forest by owner Angela Larder. 'She was old but but healthy,' Miss Larder said. Barney also died after being walked in the forest at Latchmore Brook, Hampshire .","A total of 48 dogs of different breeds have contracted the illness in the UK .

"Loic Remy's is happy to stay at QPR as long as a Champions League side doesn't come in for him according to manager Harry Redknapp, who also confirmed the club are in talks to sign Jonathan de Guzman. French striker Remy nearly joined Liverpool earlier in the summer, before a medical scuppered a move. But Redknapp has praised Remy's attitude and says the 27-year-old is ready for the new season in west London. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 'Redknapp hints that son Jamie suggested Hoddle appointment' Back in business: Harry Redknapp hopes star striker Loic Remy will be fit to play at the weekend . Interest: Redknapp also admitted the club are in talks with VIllarreal midfielder Jonathan de Guzman . 'We hope he stays because he's a fantastic player.' Redknapp told reporters. 'His attitude has been first class but you never know. He should be a £20m striker when I look at some of the prices.' 'He says he wants to play on Saturday, and unless something crops up in the Champions League for him then he wants to stay. We've had other enquiries from Premier League clubs for him, but no one of that standard.' Villarreal midfielder De Guzman has been linked with a return to the Premier League all summer, having completed two successful seasons on loan at Swansea.

"One of Britain's most fun homes, where you enter the living room through a slide, has been put on the rental market for £15,000 a month. The Rainbow House was a classical four-bedroom town home which was transformed into a bright and unique design. Its wacky layout is the work of the designer AB Rogers who, in 2009, was given the brief of converting a home into a 'magical and liberating' space where you can leave the outside world behind. Scroll down for video . One of the most remarkable features is a large metal slide that allows access to the house's living room which has a 1960s style retro dining table . Among the weird features in the former 'classic' four-bedroom town house is this amazing rainbow-coloured glass spiral staircase that leads to the bedroom . The result is a four colour-coordinated floors, a central spiral staircase and a master bedroom which features a bed that rotates 360 degrees. But the most attention-grabbing feature is the home's slide, which links a bedroom and the open-plan kitchen/living room via a trap door. The Rainbow House, in west London's fashionable Portobello Road, has now been put up for rent for £3,500 a week. This works out at £15,000 per calendar month, which is 20 times the average rental cost in the UK. The appropriately named Rainbow House is located in the fashionable Portobello Road area of west London and is available to rent for £3,500 a week . The unusual house is was designed by AB Rogers and completely refurbished in 2009 using stunning vibrant colours not normally seen inside a family home . Another interesting feature of the property,  is the master bed, pictured, which rotates through 360 degrees and can be accessed by a spiral staircase . Max Slaught, letting agent at Domus Nova, described the The Rainbow House as a 'living artwork'. He said: 'It is a showcase of cool, contemporary design that completely defies the norms of a domestic interior environment. 'The steel slide that connects the master suite above to the sofa piazza in the living space below brings out the kid in all of us. 'In fact, the house itself is like a mechanical toy filled with movement. 'The master bed rotates 360 degrees, the slide offers a super-fast route between upstairs and down and the sofa's central section rises and falls like something from the pages of a storybook. 'Then there are the Richard Woods floors: a fantastical painted illustration of wooden boards. All I can say is, wow.' According to Max Slaught, letting agent at Domus Nova, The Rainbow House is a 'living artwork' and 'a showcase of cool, contemporary design' Mr Slaught believes the house will 'bring out the inner child' in its new tenants describing the £15,000-a-month property as a 'mechanical toy filled with movement'","The multi-coloured property Rainbow House located in the fashionable Portobello Road area of west London .

"For more than half a century they had scoured the world for it, put out feelers to any likely collector, sent its description to international auction houses. But there was one place the Victoria & Albert museum didn’t look in their hunt for the rare antique Japanese chest. It was under someone’s telly in a house a few hundred yards away. Money box: The chest was deemed worthless by its owner but has now sold for 63,000 times what he paid for it . Auctioneer Aymeric Rouillac with the rare antique chest . Unknown to the museum and a legion of experts who joined the search, the exquisitely decorated 17th century lacquered coffer, one of only ten left in the world, was being used as a TV stand by an owner unaware of its exceptional provenance. Yesterday the 4ft 8in lidded casket, bought for £100 and also used as a drinks cabinet, became a treasure chest in its own right. It sold at auction for £6.3million – and once again eluded the V&A when it was snapped up by a Dutch museum. The ornate coffer, fashioned in cedar wood, metal and gold lacquer, is believed to have been made in Kyote by master craftsman Kaomi Nagashige. It bears intricate depictions of celebrated Japanese myths, including The Tale of Genji, widely acclaimed as the world’s first novel. What the illustrations do not reveal, however, is the extraordinary saga of the chest’s travels from sought-after artwork to makeshift piece of furniture. The gold lacquered chest, made in Kyoto by master craftsman Kaomi Nagashige for the Dutch East India Company, had been sought after by London's Victoria and Albert Museum since 1941 . The story begins in 1640 when the head of the Dutch East India Company’s Japanese office commissioned an order including ‘four extraordinarily fine coffers’. They were sold 18 years later with other lacquerware to French First Minister Cardinal Mazarin, and added to his extensive collection. Two were later acquired by British poet William Beckford. Beckford’s daughter Euphemia married the Duke of Hamilton and the coffers would form part of the Hamilton Palace contents sale of 1882, staged to raise funds for the palace upkeep. The V&A bought one coffer and the other, a larger one, was sold to collector Sir Trevor Lawrence, then to Welsh colliery owner Sir Clifford Cory. When Sir Clifford died in 1941, as one expert phrased it: ‘It disappeared off the radar.’ Unknown to the art world, a London-based Polish doctor called Zaniewski had bought it at a bargain price – and later sold it to a French Shell Oil engineer in 1970 for £100. At current values it would equate to roughly £1,250 – around 5,000 times less than the chest is now worth. Experts were left stunned when the chest surfaced during a house clearance and was identified as dating back to 1640 . Trouble was, the Frenchman decided the chest would make a fine base for his television. And for 16 years, that’s what he used it for at his house in South Kensington, just a three-minute walk from the V&A. Meanwhile the museum and other interested parties continued their search. When the engineer retired in 1986 he took it home to the Loire Valley, where he used it as a drinks bar and store cabinet. It resurfaced only after he died, when his family began a clear-out. Auctioneer Philippe Rouillac and his brother Aymeric recognised the chest’s likely worth and traced its remarkable history before it sold in France yesterday. Delighted Dutch curator Menno Fitski, head of East Asian art at Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, said: ‘The thing to note about this chest is that it is the best of the best: It was the best when it was made and the same still applies today. It has an incredible back story which makes it all the more special.’ The chest's detailing has been very well preserved... despite having had a television sat on it for years! Worth £6.3million? ‘Yes, it was a lot of money, but you have to pay for quality and it is worth every penny.’ Julia Hutt, curator of the V&A’s East Asian department, said she was relieved the chest had resurfaced. She added: ‘It would have been fantastic for us to have been able to bid for the chest but like many museums around the world we didn’t have the money. ‘I was delighted to hear the Rijksmuseum had won the auction – it is a very fitting home for the chest.’","Victoria and Albert Museum had been searching worldwide for it since 1941 .

"Resurrecting a prehistoric creature might seem like a sci-fi dream, but scientists say they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen. Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia. The announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia. The researchers expect test results on blood (pictured) extracted from the woolly mammoth to give the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal . ‘There was palpable excitement among the team which included scientists from Russia, the UK, the USA, Denmark, South Korea and Moldova,’ The Siberian Times reported. The researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to provide the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal. Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago. Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’ But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it. Experts expect to extract 'high quality DNA' from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia. They performed an autopsy on the female mammoth (pictured) focusing on its liver. The frozen beast was found last year in permafrost in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia . The mammoth's liver (pictured) is  very well preserved and the researchers said that it looks like there are some solid fragments inside it. They haven't got round to studying them yet, but they think they might be kidney stones . ‘We must have a reason to do this, as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity,’ he said. A cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother. Viktoria Egorova, chief of the Research and Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory of the Medical Clinic of North-Eastern Federal University, said: ‘We have dissected the soft tissues of the mammoth - and I must say that we didn't expect such results. ‘The carcass that is more than 43,000 years old has preserved better than a body of a human buried for six months. The scientists found the liver intact on the mammoth (pictured), which The mammoth was discovered in May 2013 on Malolyakhovskiy Island in Siberia. It is thought that the animal died an unnatural death and spent many hours in agony . ‘The tissue cut clearly shows blood vessels with strong walls. Inside the vessels there is haemolysed blood where for the first time we have found erythrocytes [red blood cells]. Muscle and adipose tissues [body fat] are well preserved,’ she added. The scientists found the liver intact on the mammoth, which was discovered in May 2013 on Malolyakhovskiy Island in Siberia. Its trunk is also in excellent condition. Mr Khayrullin said: ‘The mammoth died an unnatural death,’ explaining this was detectable from the blood. The researchers said that tissue shows blood vessels with strong walls. Inside the vessels there is haemolysed blood and muscle and adipose tissues are well preserved . The scientists found the liver intact (pictured) in the mammoth. Its trunk is also in excellent condition. Here, one expert measures a lump in the animal's organ, which is thought to be a kidney stone . ‘It died in agony which lasted for about 16 to 18 hours,’ he said. ‘This is also confirmed by the position of the body, with its back leg stretched in an unnatural way. 'We think this was a female mammoth that fell into an ice hole from which she couldn't escape.’ Originally, after the mammoth's discovery, it was believed the creature was about 10,000 years old.  But recent analysis has put her age at 43,000 years. The mammoth disappeared from Siberia at the end of the Pleistocene period some 10,000 years ago in circumstances that are a matter of scientific debate. Climate change and hunting by humans may have been factors. An isolated population of the creature survived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until around 4,000 years ago. The announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in Malolyakhovskiy Island (pictured) in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia . The scientists said they did not expect to see the soft tissues of the mammoth (pictured) in such good condition and believe there is a 'high chance' the creature could be cloned . Scientists from a number of Russian and US institutions carried out a full anatomic necropsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites, on the ancient bision . An ancient bison was discovered in July 2011 in a remote part of Russia, but scientists are only now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the extinction of some bison species around 9,000 years ago will be revealed. The autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison and scientists will now look for parasites that might have plagued the animals. The creature was found perfectly preserved in July 2011 in the Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, on the shore of a lake in the north of Ust-Yana district, where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found. 'The discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found,’ said Albert Protopopov, chief of the Mammoth Fauna Research Department of the Yakutian Academy of Sciences. Experts are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy, which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites. U.S. scientists have long been studying bison living in North America and hope to compare them to the animal’s Yakutian relatives. The scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison's digestive organs and to publish their research next year. Dr Protopopov said that histology samples – the samples showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - will prove the most interesting, as they will be the first chance scientists have to studying parasites attached to ancient bison.","Experts believe there is a 'high chance' that cloning is possible having performed an autopsy on a woolly mammoth .

"Cruel: Natalie Armitage (pictured), 20, admitted four animal welfare charges when she appeared before magistrates . A pet owner has been banned from keeping animals after she starved her cat so badly he broke into a hamster's cage and ate the animal inside. Jeffrey the cat was only allowed to drink water from the toilet and eat stale dog biscuits so in desperation he mauled the rodent, a court heard. Natalie Armitage, 20, has admitted four animal welfare charges and has been banned from keeping animals for five years. Calderdale Magistrates Court heard that RSPCA inspectors repeatedly called at her address in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, in October last year because of welfare concerns. The police were called to gain access to the house, which was in darkness. 'In the living room the hamster cage was broken into pieces and there was no sign of the hamster,' said Tanya Forrest, prosecuting. Eventually, Armitage answered the door to an inspector and was asked 'where is the hamster?' to which she replied: 'I think the cat has eaten it.' Ms Forrest said: 'I think that is evidenced by the cage - the cat broke into it. 'Regrettably, the consequence was the hamster met its fate.' Armitage, who was not represented, said she went to Crewe for dental treatment but her son was taken ill and she was away longer than expected. She had fallen out with her mum and sister and had no-one to access the property. Armitage said she thought she was away for around six nights. Hungry: Jeffrey the cat (pictured) was so starved of suitable food and water that he destroyed the cage of the terrified animal and gobbled him up, a court heard . Scene: The RSPCA found that the hamster's cage had been broken open so the cat could find a meal . Chairman of the bench, Andrew Entwistle, told her: 'You left the cat for longer than you like to admit. The cat did suffer. The hamster is no more.' The charges she admitted covered not providing a suitable environment for Jeffrey, not ensuring his need for a suitable diet including water, failing to protect Jeffrey from pain, suffering, injury and disease, and not protecting the hamster from pain, suffering, injury and disease. Armitage, who is on benefits, was fined £50 with £200 costs and a £15 pounds victim surcharge, and was disqualified from keeping animals for five years. A deprivation order was made to take Jeffrey, currently in boarding, off her. Carnage: Jeffrey was only able to crink toilet water and eat dry dog biscuits, but he is now re-homed . After the case, an RSPCA spokesperson said: 'This is a very sad situation for  both the cat and the hamster. Both were left to fend for themselves for nearly  a whole week. 'It is not the cat's fault that he found himself drawn, through hunger, to seek out his only option for sustenance. But on the other hand, one can only imagine the hamster's terror as his cage was broken apart. 'It is an offence to leave your pets without arranging for their basic welfare needs to be taken care of.'","Natalie Armitage, 20, left Jeffrey with only toilet water and dog biscuits .

"Hamas militants have released a video allegedly showing their fighters attacking an Israeli watchtower from a hidden tunnel before killing five guards stationed there. The clip, which was broadcast on Hamas TV, shows militants running along a tunnel carrying machine guns and rocket launchers before emerging near an Israeli watchtower. They catch an Israeli sentry by surprise before opening fire storming the watchtower compound to surround a fallen soldier. Scroll down for video, warning disturbing footage . Armed with rocket launchers and machine guns, the militants apparently take guards at the base by surprise before opening fire and killing five of them . At the start of the video, Hamas soldiers can allegeldy be seen emerging from a tunnel carrying rocket launchers and machine guns before attacking an Israeli outpost . Mohammed Deif, the shadowy leader of Hamas's armed wing, said in a voiceover that Palestinians would continue confronting Israel until its blockade on Gaza was lifted. 'The occupying entity will not enjoy security unless our people live in freedom and dignity,' Deif said. 'There will be no ceasefire before the (Israeli) aggression is stopped and the blockade is lifted. We will not accept interim solutions.' Today has been the bloodiest day of Israel's three-week invasion of Gaza to date, with at least 100 Palestinians killed during heavy bombardment and shelling. Local hospital officials put the total number of Palestinian dead in the conflict at 1,200, most of them civilians. On the Israeli side, 53 soldiers and three civilians have been killed. In the short clip militants can be seen running through a set of iron gates into what they claim is an Israeli outpost before attacking the guards inside . The Israeli assault came after the deaths of 10 soldiers in Palestinian cross-border attacks on Monday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of a long conflict ahead. The footage is likely to intensify the Israeli army's efforts in Gaza, as  their main objectives is to destroy tunnels which officials say are used by militants to carry out attacks. The army has asked for a week more to complete the mission, and there has been strong Israeli public support for holding course. UNRWA, the main U.N. relief agency in Gaza, said it was at 'breaking point' with more than 200,000 Palestinians having taken shelter in its schools and buildings following calls by Israel for civilians to evacuate whole neighbourhoods before military operations. The video seems to show fighters, whose faces are obscured, surrounding a man on the floor while kicking him as gunfire can be heard . Hamas have released a video which they say shows militants running along a hidden tunnel before emerging and attacking an Israeli outpost, taking the guards by surprise . Today Israeli tanks destroyed Gaza's only power station. Even before the strike Gaza residents had electricity for only about three hours a day and today's hit is bound to reduce supplies even further. The plant supplies up to two-thirds of Gaza's energy needs. Officials said the it could be out of action for a year. Electricity was cut to the city of Gaza and many other parts of the Hamas-dominated territory after what officials said was Israeli shelling of the tanks containing about 3 million litres of diesel fuel. 'The power plant is finished,' said its director, Mohammed al-Sharif. An Israeli military spokeswoman had no immediate comment and said she was checking the report. Gaza City municipality said damage to the station could halt many of the area's water pumps, and it urged residents to ration water consumption. South Gaza gets some power from neighbouring Egypt. Power lines from Israel have been damaged during the war. Tuesday marked the deadliest day of the conflict so far as Israel stepped up its shelling operation, leaving at least 100 Palestinians dead . So far the conflict has killed 1,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, while 53 Israeli solders have died and three of its civilians have been killed . Palestinians launched 54 rockets towards southern and central Israel, including the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem area, the military said, adding that five were shot down by Iron Dome interceptors while the rest fell wide, causing no damage. The Israeli military said soldiers killed five gunmen who opened fire after emerging from a tunnel inside the Gaza Strip and that 110 targets were struck in the enclave on Tuesday. They included four weapons caches, which the military said were hidden in mosques, and a rocket launcher near another mosque. Residents said 20 houses were destroyed and two mosques hit. Hospitals said tank shells and air strikes killed 12 people in north Gaza, including an UNRWA doctor and his brother. UNRWA said it found a rocket cache in one of its central Gaza schools on Tuesday, the third such incident. Today shelling by Israeli tanks destroyed the only power station in Gaza. Before the strike Palestinians only received three hours of power a day, which will now reduce further . Israel has balked at freeing up Gaza's borders under any de-escalation deal unless Hamas's disarmament is also guaranteed. Egypt said it was revising an unconditional truce proposal that Israel had originally accepted but Hamas rejected. 'We are hearing that Israel has approved a ceasefire but Hamas has not,' an Egyptian official told Reuters, an account that the Netanyahu government neither confirmed nor denied. The U.S.-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, saying it was also speaking for Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, voiced support on Tuesday for a 24-72 hour ceasefire. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri disputed that statement but confirmed there were 'intensive, ongoing contacts' on a truce.","Footage released by Hamas shows militants attacking Israeli outpost .

"Two bad decisions and with them Arsenal lost the Emirates Cup. For one, they could whinge at Martin Atkinson, the referee who in an apparent moment of pre-season complacency denied them a clear penalty. For the other, they can only look at themselves for reasons why a £53million striker was left unmarked at a set-piece. Radamel Falcao rarely needs help in front of goal, but considering his first-half header was his first goal since his knee injury in January the Monaco striker probably won’t mind. VIDEO Scroll down for former team-mates Falcao and Sanchez both net for River Plate . Goalden touch: Radamel Falcao (centre) heads the opening goal of the game for Monaco .

Change of heart: Atkinson eventually gave a free-kick after advice from his assistant referee . At least you think it's funny! Atkinson and his assistant have a smile as they leave the pitch at the end . Livid: Mathieu Flamini (centre) protests after the baffling decision . Arsenal: Szczesny 6; Debuchy 6.5 (Bellerin 90), Chambers 7 (Miquel 46, 5.5), Koscielny 6, Monreal 6; Ramsey 7, Arteta 5.5, Wilshere 6.5 (Zelalem 73, 6); Sanchez 7 (Flamini 73, 6), Giroud 5.5 (Oxlade-Chamberlain 46, 6), Cazorla 6 (Akpom 73, 6). Subs: Flamini, Coquelin, Zelalem, Akpom, Bellerín, Hayden, Martinez. Booked: Wilshere, Miquel . Monaco: Subasic; Dirar, Raggi, Carvalho (Abdennour 85), Echiejile; Bakayoko, Kondogbia; Ferreira-Carrasco, Moutinho (Germain 58), Ocampos (Fabinho 72); Falcao (Martial 58). Subs: Fabinho, Kurzawa, Berbatov, Isimat-Mirin, Toulalan, Bahamboula, Caillard. Goal: Falcao . The goal gave Valencia the branded trinket, their 3-1 win over Benfica earlier in the day making the difference, along with Atkinson’s highly questionable call in the second half of Arsenal’s match. Chuba Akpom had raced clear with 10 minutes still to play when Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic raced off his line and clattered him. Akpom was possibly offside when he made his run, but was certainly inside the area when the foul occurred. Atkinson gave a yellow card and a free-kick after advice from his assistant; strange calls even for summer football. Not that it matters, especially. This, like all pre-season matches, was about learning. In that context, Arsene Wenger offered what looked like a significant clue concerning the line-up of his side for the Community Shield against Manchester City, with left back Kieran Gibbs perhaps the only player to come in. Arsenal handed a start to £10m signing Mathieu Debuchy at right back, indicating again that Calum Chambers is being groomed for a role at centre-half. The pair of them, £22m worth of recruitments, were solid, particularly the latter. Touch: Falcao controls the ball and shields it from Arsenal's young new signing Calum Chambers . VIDEO Wenger impressed by Chambers . A kick in the teeth: Sanchez puts his head where it hurts and is met by Ricardo Carvalho's boot . Acrobatic attempt: Mikel Arteta tries an overhead kick as Arsenal went in search of an equaliser . Midfield battle: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain tussles with Geoffrey Kondogbia . Star attraction: Arsenal's marquee signing Alexis Sanchez runs at Ricardo Carvalho . Stop right there: Former Chelsea defender Carvalho (left) halts Olivier Giroud's run with a sliding tackle . Aerial duel: Falcao gets his head to the ball before another South American, the Chilean Sanchez . That's your lot: Sanchez went off in the second half . Chambers impressed with his tackling and positioning, even if he did balloon one of Arsenal’s best early chances over the bar from a Santi Cazorla corner. He certainly has the composure to play in the middle. Debuchy, meanwhile, has evidently developed an understanding with Alexis Sanchez, getting forward often to support and feed the attacker in whom so much is expected. If there is a flaw in Debuchy’s make-up then perhaps it comes in his willingness to run back after those excursions into the opposition half. Wenger likes his full-backs to advance, but what goes up must come down. Debuchy’s failure to follow such orders led directly to Lucas Ocampos being free to shoot after 25 minutes. For Sanchez, there were no such concerns, the Chilean a ball of energy and movement. His passing is occasionally fantastic; his work rate frantic. At various stages he rotated through Arsenal’s attacking positions and was probably their most dangerous player in each, certainly in the middle. After 10 minutes, his 40-yard cross-field pass was half a yard away from putting Olivier Giroud clean through. That chance was cut out by a lunge from Andrea Raggi, the captain of a side that probably deserved to lead at half-time. The manner in which Monaco went ahead was a little strange to those who might a £53m talent to be marked at a set-piece. Alas, Falcao was left unattended when Joao Moutinho swung over a free-kick – conceded a little needlessly by Jack Wilshere - and the striker headed past Wojciech Szczesny. Arsenal nearly levelled after the restart when Cazorla’s little flick put Wilshere through, but Subasic pulled off an excellent reflex save. And Sanchez fired just wide shortly after the hour. Akpom then had his shout ignored for a penalty and Monaco gave Valencia the cup. Keeping him under pressure: Giroud challenges Monaco goalkeeper Daniel Subasic .

"Scientists have produced the first cloned dog in Britain after its owner won a competition to have her elderly pet replicated. Rebecca Smith, 29, from west London, put her elderly dachshund, Winnie, forward to be cloned in a £60,000 competition organised by South Korean tech firm, Sooam Biotech. She won, and the cloned puppy, called Mini Winnie, was conceived in a test tube and born in Seoul on 30 March. Scroll down for video . Britain's first cloned dog: This dachshund puppy, born on 30 March, was cloned from a 12-year-old, Winnie . Rebecca Smith, 29, with her cloned puppy, mini Winnie, at the Seoul lab where it was conceived and born . Miss Smith, a caterer, entered her 12-year-old dachshund, Winnie, into the competition for a £60,000 cloning . Tiny puppy: The dachshund, called mini Winnie, was born in a laboratory in Seoul, South Korea . The puppy, seen suckling its surrogate mother, will be flown to its new home in London when it is six months . The process involves obtaining live cells from a living dog or a dog five days after it has died. Dogs that have similar ovulation time are selected as egg donors and surrogate mothers. Eggs are collected from the egg donor through a procedure called ‘flushing’ and the nuclei of the eggs, which contain DNA of the egg donor, is removed. Then donor cell is then injected into the nucleated egg and the two cells are ‘fused’ together. This fusion procedure produces a cloned embryo that is transferred into a surrogate dog. The whole process takes less than a day but comes with a hefty price tag, at around $100,000 or £63,000 to clone one dog. Sooam Biotech has cloned highly trained rescue and police dogs for the South Korean government, as well as a number of highly prized pets in the U.S. The process was filmed by a television company and will be aired tonight. The first mammal to be cloned was Dolly the sheep, born in Edinburgh in 1996.  Dogs were first cloned in South Korea in 2005, by Sooam Biotech scientist Dr Woo Suk Hwang, but this is the first time a British dog has been reproduced. Miss Smith, a caterer, said she read about the cloning competition and entered her 12-year-old dachshund, sending in videos of her pet. She said: 'My sausage dog is very special but she is 12 and not going to be around for ever.' Winnie made it onto a shortlist of three, and after she won, a sample of her skin tissue was removed, and sent to South Korea in liquid nitrogen.  There, the cells were put into eggs provided by a bitch of the same breed, before a spark of electricity fused the two. The embryo was then put into a donor animal, and the resulting puppy was born by caesarean section, weighing just over 1lb, ten days ago. Miss Smith, who flew to Seoul and watched the puppy being born, said it looked just like her own pet.  British quarantine restrictions mean she now has to wait six months before she can bring the puppy home to meet the original Winnie.

Original: Winnie the dachshund is credited by her owner with helping her overcome an eating disorder . South Korean scientist, Hwang Woo-Suk cloned the first dog ever, afghan hound Snuppy, in 2005 . The dog's owner, who credits Winnie with helping her overcome the bulimia she suffered as a teenager, told the Mirror: 'Personality-wise, I couldn't tell you [if it is identical to Winnie], because it doesn't see and it doesn't hear yet - it is just a little sausage dog that wriggles around drinking milk.' The South Korean firm, which produced the world's first cloned dog, Snuppy, and has also cloned highly trained rescue and police dogs for the South Korean government, now hopes other Britons will want to pay £60,000 to have their pets cloned. Cloning expert John Woestendiek said that the dog cloning industry was based in South Korea because it has much lower ethical standards for the treatment of dogs than in Europe or the United States. He said that some of the dogs used in the cloning process as egg donors or surrogate mothers were often killed and eaten afterwards. And one of the British scientists responsible for cloning Dolly the sheep said he was sceptical about the benefits of cloning dogs. Sir Ian Wilmut told the Mail:  ‘Owners will be disappointed. So much of the personality of a dog comes from the way you treat them. If you spend £60,000 on a cloned dog you will treat it differently.’ In 1979, researchers produced the first genetically identical mice by splitting mouse embryos and then implanting the resulting embryos in female mice. Not long after, researchers produced the first genetically identical cows, chickens and sheep by moving the nucleus of a cell taken from an early embryo into an egg that had its nucleus removed. But it wasn’t until 1996, that researchers were able to clone the first mammal from a mature cell taken from an adult animal. After 276 attempts, Scottish researchers produced Dolly, the lamb from the udder cell of a six-year-old sheep. Two years later, researchers in Japan cloned eight calves from a single cow, but only four survived. Besides cattle and sheep, other mammals that have been cloned from somatic cells include: cat, deer, dog, horse, mule, ox, rabbit and rat. In addition, a rhesus monkey has been cloned by embryo splitting. In 2008, scientists were able to create clones of a mouse that had been dead and frozen for 16 years. It was the first time they have been able to clone a frozen animal. A cat called Little Nicky earned the title as the first commercially cloned pet in 2004 when a woman in Texas paid $50,000 (£30,000) for the service. Dr Woo Suk Hwang, the chief technical officer at Sooam Biotech, pioneered the dog cloning technique in 2005. His group is currently the only company in the world that offers dog cloning commercially.So far, Sooam Biotech has carried out around 400 cloning procedures with big interest in the Far East and America. But a spokesman for animal rights organisation PETA said: ‘It’s understandable that people fantasise about replicating an adored dog but cloning can only replicate genetic material. ‘Cloned animals will develop different personalities. We cannot resurrect animals, but we can give living animals in desperate need a chance at a happy life. Every year, millions of homeless animals are euthanised.’ Scientists in Scotland were the first in the world to clone an adult mammal, resulting in the birth of Dolly the sheep at the Roslin Institute in Midlothian in 1996. While there had been previous clonings from embryo cells, Dolly was the first successful cloning of an adult mammal. Scientists took DNA from a single sheep cell and injected it into an egg, which was implanted into a surrogate mother. Dolly, who had three mothers (one who provided the DNA, another who provided the egg, and a third who was the surrogate), was born on 5 July at the institute, in what was hailed the breakthrough of the year by Science magazine. One of the British creators of Dolly the sheep (pictured), who became the world's first cloned mammal in 1996, has said he was sceptical of the benefits of cloning dogs . Dolly lived her entire life at the institute, where she was bred with a Welsh Mountain lamb and produced six lambs. She was put down aged six in 2003 after suffering from a progressive lung disease.  Sheep usually live to 11 or 12, and there was speculation that her premature death may have been caused by her having been cloned. After Dolly was cloned, many other large animals including horses, bulls, pigs and deer were cloned. Now, despite advances in the cloning process, animal welfare groups say the risks, including deformities, are still too high.  And others critcise the methods used by scientists. Dr Katy Taylor, head of science at the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, said: ‘Each clone is the result of a process that causes great harm and suffering to a large number of animals.’","The first British dog to be cloned was born in Seoul, S Korea, on 30 March .

"The death toll since the start of the Syrian conflict has exceeded 100,000, a group of activists have claimed. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had tallied a total of 100,191 deaths over the 27 months of the conflict. But it said that it expects that figure is a conservative one as neither President Bashar al Assad's troops or rebel forces have been forthcoming about the numbers killed. Deadly war: Activists have claimed that the death toll in Syria has exceeded 100,000 since the conflict there started in March 2011 . Bloody: More than 36,000 of those killed in the conflict so far are said to be civilians . Observatory chief Rami Abdul-Rahman claimed that of the dead, 36,661 were civilians, with 25,407 of Assad's troops killed and 17,311 pro government fighters. The death toll also includes 13,539 rebels, 2,015 army defectors and 2,518 foreign fighters battling against the regime, according to the group. The United Nations had claimed earlier this month that the death toll stood at 93,000 between March 2011 when the conflict started and the end of April this year. The figures were revealed as a diplomat claimed that Britain and the U.S have notified the United Nations of 10 different incidents of alleged chemical weapon use by the Syrian government. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because all the incidents have not been made public, said Wednesday that the Americans and British have found no evidence that the opposition possesses or has used chemical weapons. Syria has refused to allow a U.N. investigation team led by Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom into the country to investigate allegations raised initially by Britain and France and then by the U.S. Conservative estimate: The group expects the death toll to be even higher as neither President Assad's troops or rebel forces have been forthcoming with casualty figures . Sellstrom was in Turkey Sunday and Monday, reportedly talking to doctors who treated victims of chemical use, and is expected to produce an interim report on his findings, the diplomat said. Abdul-Rahman said that the group's tally of army casualties is based on information from military medical sources, records obtained by the group from state agencies and activists' own count of military funerals in government areas of the country. Another source for regime fatalities are activist videos showing dead soldiers killed in rebel-held areas who are later identified. War torn: More than 13,000 rebel fighters have been killed in the 27 months of fighting so far . Abdul Rahman's claims came hours after the U.N.'s special envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, said that an international peace conference proposed by Russia and the U.S. will not take place until later in the summer, partly because of opposition disarray. The fighting has increasingly been taking sectarian overtones. Sunni Muslims dominate the rebel ranks while Assad's regime is dominated by Alawites, an offshoot sect of Shiite Islam. It has also spilled over Syria's borders, especially into Lebanon, where factions supporting opposing sides have clashed in the northern city of Tripoli and in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Lebanese are divided over Syria's civil war, with some supporting President Bashar Assad's regime and others backing the opposition. More than 550,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon as a result of the fighting. Earlier this week, sectarian tensions drew Lebanon's army into the fray. Eighteen soldiers were killed in a two-day battle between the army and supporters of a radical Sunni sheik in the southern city of Sidon. Shocking: According to a UN source, the US and Britain have evidence of 10 instances where chemical weapons have been used by Assad's forces . The army had earlier reported 17 deaths and said today that another soldier died of his wounds in hospital. The conflict reached the capital Beirut on Wednesday when masked men ambushed a bus and attacked the around 30 people aboard with knives, a Lebanese official said. He said 10 people were wounded in the attack in the eastern part of the city, including five Syrians, two Palestinians and three Lebanese, the officials said. He spoke anonymously in line with regulations. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the bus was carrying Syrians headed to a TV studio in the eastern Sunday Market district to take part in a cultural program. It said there were eight attackers, who fled the area.","The claim has been made by the Syrian Observatory for Human rights .

"It is the first glimpse of Apple's plan to take on the fitness and health world - and the app that could control the much anticipated iWatch. Called Healthbook, the new app is expected to be unveiled in June at Apple's annual developer conference. It offers everything from food and sleep tracking to blood sugar level analysis - and can even tell how much water you've drunk. Scroll down for video . At tonight's event, Cook is set to unveil the next-generation of mobile software, dubbed iOS 8.  Although many of the changes are likely to incremental, the biggest addition is rumoured to be an application called Healthbook, which is believed to have leaked last month (pictured) and is designed to track and monitor fitness . A recent mockup of the iBand, which could include health sensors that send data to the Healthbook app . According to the blog 9to5mac, which created these mockups, the app is set to be Apple's first move into the fitness tracking industry. 'Multiple sources working directly on the initiative’s development have since provided new details and images of Healthbook that provide a clearer view of Apple’s plans for dramatically transforming the mobile healthcare and fitness-tracking space,' Mark Gurman wrote on the site. The app shows the scale of Apple's plans. Healthbook has sections that can track data for bloodwork, heart rate, hydration, blood pressure, physical activity, nutrition, blood sugar, sleep, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and weight. Apple is said to currently be testing the Healthbook software with iOS 8, the next version of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch operating system. Expected to be revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June in San Francisco, the app could also work with other health trackers to collect data - although some believe it will work on with Apple's own as yet unannounced health-tracker gadgets. The app also shows sleep tracking capabilities, although it is unclear how the app will collect the data . Experts believe the much-rumoured iWatch could actually be a fitness band. T3 magazine mocked up what it expects the gadget to look like. 'Tim Cook has promised us a new product category this year and all the evidence points to a health-related wristband/watch,' said Mark Mayne of T3. The iBand could be announced as early as June, some believe . 'Apple has flagged its interest through a number of recent hires, such as fitness guru Jay Blahnik from Nike, sleep expert Dr. Roy J.E.M. Raymann from Philips Research and former Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts.

"A dictionary has revealed how 13th century nicknames denoting a person's job, appearance or religion have become the family names many people use today. The use of surnames was largely unheard of in Europe prior to the 11th century, but as people began to need to be identified for reasons such as paying taxes they became increasingly prevalent. Lexicographers Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges have revealed where many European family names originated from in their book A Dictionary Of Surnames. Scroll down for video . What's in a name: Taylor Swift's surname may have come from one of her ancestors being a fast runner, while actress Emily Blunt's surname traditionally denoted someone with fair hair . According to the book's authors, names relating to a person's job, where they lived or even what they looked like, became increasingly during the Middle Ages as societies became more bureaucratic. For example, in a town or village where many people shared the same first name, individuals might have started to be known by another characteristic. According to the book, which examines more than 100,000 last names, the name Bass related to a short man, Read - a person with red hair, or a ruddy complexion, Swift - a fast person, and Vaisey someone with a cheerful disposition. The name game: The surname Cruise, as used by actor Tom, referred to a person who was bold or fierce, and Jarvis Cocker's surname denoted someone who was bellicose, or inclined to fight . Bass - A short man . Belcher - Someone with a fair or lovely face . Blunt - Someone with blond hair . Cannon - Someone living in a clergy house . Cocker -  A bellicose person . Cruise - Bold or fierce . Dolittle - A lazy man . Hart - A nickname meaning stag . Fairfax - Someone with beautiful, long hair . Foot - Someone with a foot deformity . Loach - A nickname from a small fish . Lovell - A nickname from lou, meaning wolf; . Newcombe, Newman - A new arrival in a place . Palmer — Someone who had been on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land . Read - A person with red hair or a ruddy complexion . Savage - A wild or uncouth person; . Swift - A fast runner . Thewlis - An ill mannered person . Twigg - A thin person . Vaisey - A cheerful person (from enveisie, meaning playful, merry) Wight - Strong-willed or brave . The surname Cruise, as used by actor Tom - who has dropped part of his surname Cruise Mapother - referred to a person who was bold or fierce, while actress Emily Blunt may be descended from someone known for his blond hair. Someone who stayed at home might be known by the house where he lived, while someone who travelled from another town or country could be referred to denoting the place where they had come from. They may even simply have been referred to as New, Newman or Newcombe. Others took on their trades as last names, such as Smith, Wright, and Chandler, or their work as a servant to someone of a higher status, such as Prior, Monk, King, and Earl. In the early Middle Ages a son may have been known by a different name to his father, if he performed a different role, or exhibited another characteristic. However, as families became increasingly stable, names started to be handed down through generations, with wives adopting her husband's family name, and children taking theirs from their fathers. 'The phenomenon of the modern family name is, broadly, of medieval European origin and is associated with the rise of bureaucracies,' said Mr Hanks. 'Tax collectors, beadles and bailiffs, sheriffs and reeves (officers of law enforcement and the courts) had, like their modern counterparts, a particular need for the precise identification of individuals. 'In a period when the eldest son inherited property and titles, it became normal to inherit the father's surname along with other property.' Even in cases where surnames had been based on a negative nickname, once the monikers were put on record they were very rarely changed.","A Dictionary Of Surnames lists the origins of more than 100,000 names .

"Lewis Grabban claimed his fourth goal in a week and Norwich their third straight win after deservedly beating local rivals Ipswich 1-0 at Portman Road. Grabban, a big-money move from Bournemouth in the summer, continued his red-hot form with a 24th minute winner, heading in from close range after indecision from Cole Skuse and keeper Dean Gerken. Daryl Murphy missed a gilt-edged chance for Ipswich in the second half but Grabban could have claimed a hat-trick after lobbing over when clean through and then seeing a shot cleared off the line by Tommy Smith. Leap: Lewis Grabban rises high in the box to score his fourth goal in as many games for the Canaries . Ipswich: Gerken, Mings, Chambers (C), Smith,Berra, Skuse, Murphy, McGoldrick, Anderson (Sammon 72), Tabb (Henshall 72), Hyam (Bru 71) Norwich: Ruddy; Martin (c), R Bennett (Garrido 7),Turner, Whittaker; Tettey, Johnson; Lafferty (Bennett 53), Hoolahan (O'Neil 83), Redmond; Grabban. Goals: Grabban 24 . Norwich shaded the early possession, but it was typical derby fare played out under a red-hot atmosphere but with little composure. A nice break from Canaries right-back Steven Whittaker saw his shot comfortably gathered by Gerken with the angle against the defender. The Town keeper was again equal to a shot from outside the area, from Grabban after good work from Nathan Redmond halfway through a tight first half. Two minutes later, the visitors broke the deadlock after a horror show from the Town defence. After a corner was initially cleared, Alex Tettey headed back in and Grabban got in between Skuse and Gerken to head in from close range with the home defence claiming offside. It was his fourth of the season after scoring twice in midweek against Blackburn, following his first goal for the club against Watford last Saturday. Frustrating: Gerken looks to his defence as Norwich take advantage of a defensive lapse to take the lead . Delighted: Grabban celebrates with fellow new signing Kyle Lafferty after putting Norwich ahead . Ipswich went close to equalising in the 29th minute with David McGoldrick shooting just wide after a neat free-kick from Skuse. It took the hosts 37 minutes to finally test John Ruddy, though Murphy's shot lacked power, before they almost equalised five minutes after the restart when a patient build-up lead to Jay Tabb's teasing cross met powerfully by Murphy who headed wide of the far post from the edge of the six-yard box. Just two minutes later, Norwich were guilty of missing an equally good chance when Javier Garrido's through ball found Grabban in space but he opted to try and chip Gerken and a great chance to provide breathing space sailed harmlessly over the bar. Elated: Neil Adams celebrates the first derby win of his managerial career with midfielder Bradley Johnson . Shortly before the hour mark, McGoldrick tested Ruddy at his near post before Grabban saw a speculative volley pushed away by Gerken. The in-form forward went even closer after being released by Bradley Johnson but, after rounding Gerken, his effort was cleared off the line by the backtracking Smith. With neither side giving an inch, Town sub Alex Henshall got beyond the Norwich defence but his dangerous cross was hacked clear by Michael Turner. With 10 minutes to go, Wes Hoolahan almost made the points safe breaking clear down the left but having a powerful shot blocked by Gerken. Real chances, and entertainment, was few and far between as the clock ticked down and leaving the Norwich fans celebrating a local derby victory.","Grabban's first-half goal was enough for Norwich to win at Portman Road .

"Eating 40 per cent less food could extend a person's life by 20 years, according to scientists. Researchers at the Institute of Health Ageing at University College London are developing a treatment they hope will combat the 'disease' of getting older. They are looking into how genetics and lifestyle can be adapted to offset the effects of ageing and add years, possibly decades, to a person's life. Incentive: Eating 40 per cent less food could extend a person's life by 20 years, according to scientists . Age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegeneration can also be combated, it is claimed. One line of inquiry that the team is developing is how the life of a rat can be increased by up to 30 per cent simply by reducing its food intake. Lead researcher Dr Piper told the Independent: 'If you reduce the diet of a rat by 40 per cent it will live for 20 or 30 per cent longer. So we would be talking 20 years of human life. This has shown on all sorts of organisms, even labradors.' The scientists are also studying fruit flies, which share 60 per cent of human genes and age in a similar manner, and mice. They have already prolonged the healthy lifespan in both flies and mice by using drug treatments and a modified diet. It is hoped that this combination will also work to extend human life. Dr Piper said: 'If we discover the genes . involved with ageing, we should be able to delay ageing itself. This is . what we've found.' He added that his team has extended the life of organisms by mutating single genes. The researchers have also lessen the effects of a mutation which can cause Alzheimer's. However, Dr Piper cautioned that the field of research into extending life is only a decade old, so remains 'theoretical'. It is their unique approach to treating all age-related diseases as being caused by the 'disease' of ageing itself that sets their research apart, he said. The research is being displayed at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London.",UCL scientists studying how genetics and lifestyle can be adapted to offset the effects of ageing .
"A grandmother with an aggressive brain tumor has died after waiting more than two months for insurance coverage because of mixups with Nevada's health care exchange. The family of Linda Rolain, 64, who passed away on Monday, had joined two lawsuits against the State of Nevada and the company that built its troubled online software, Xerox, since April. 'I came in, held her hand,' her devastated husband of 45 years, Robert, told KTNV. 'I whispered in her ear ""I love you, I'm gonna be fine"". She knew she was gonna die. She really knew it.' The state launched the Silver State Exchange in October in response to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act - but it was fraught with problems and Xerox was finally dropped in May. Scroll down for video . Loss: Linda Rolain, 64, passed away from her brain tumor on Monday. She had encountered numerous issues with getting health insurance coverage following the Affordable Care Act . After suffering a seizure at the end of 2012, Rolain learned in early 2013 that she had a brain tumor and because she couldn’t afford health insurance in the private market, she was the prime candidate for the Affordable Care Act, the Las Vegas Sun noted. She tried enrolling in the Silver State Exchange in November - well ahead of the December 15 deadline - but repeatedly struggled with sign-up problems and spent hours on the phone to representatives. They finally enrolled in January and sent a $138 money order to the exchange for a plan that was set to start March 1 - but when she sought treatment, she was told there was no record of her name. The insurance company finally sent her an insurance card in May and she underwent brain surgery but suffered through a difficult recovery. She spent her final three weeks in a hospital bed in her living room and in her final four days, she slipped into a coma. Heartbroken: Her husband Robert said that after all the trouble, Linda knew that she was going to die . Together: Robert cared for his wife of 45 years in a hospital bed in their living room in her last few weeks . Robert Rolain, who lost 60 pounds due to stress, said working with the Silver State Exchange was 'pure hell'. He said he . believes that if enrollment had worked properly, Linda could have . undergone chemotherapy and radiation to get rid of the tumor - and that . she would still be alive. Husband Robert Rolain . 'It's hard, knowing she could have lived a little longer anyway,' he said. Rolain was one of about 150 Nevadans . suing Xerox for enrollment issues that . left them without the health insurance they paid for, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Her lawyer said he fears that hers will not be the last case to end so tragically. 'Some of . our clients are so ill that if their needs are not addressed now, it is a . matter of life and death,' Matthew Callister told the Review-Journal. 'We urge all Nevadans to verify that their . insurance is active and in place in light of the many problems that . hundreds if not thousands of Nevadans have gone through.' Much-needed care: After first trying to apply for health insurance coverage in November last year, Mrs Rolain finally underwent surgery in mid-May for her brain tumor but she struggled to recover . Problems: Her family joined two lawsuits against the State of Nevada and the company that built its troubled online software (pictured), Xerox, since April. Xerox has now been dropped . Silver State Exchange officials could not be reached for comment. A Xerox spokesman told the Review-Journal in a statement that the company would not 'be able to comment on this tragic development'. Nevada received $91 million in federal money to run the exchange and paid Xerox $12.3 million to build its website, Nevada Health Link, the Las Vegas Sun reported. By June 1, 36,000 people had signed up, which was 30 per cent of their goal. See below for video .","Linda Rolain passed away at her Las Vegas home on Monday .

"Azelle Rodney, 24, died in 2005 after being shot by a former police officer, known only as E7, as police sought to move in on him over a double stabbing . Firearms officers are threatening industrial action after a former policeman was charged with murdering a drug dealer during a Scotland Yard operation. Armed officers are said to be considering a staged walk-out after it was confirmed that the ex-officer will stand trial over the 2005 death of Azelle Rodney, who died in a hail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen. Rodney, 24, was hit six times, once each in the arm and back, and fatally four times in the head in Edgware, north London. The man accused of murdering him, only the third policeman to be charged with committing murder in the course of his duties, can only be identified as E7 after being granted anonymity during a public inquiry. The secrecy order, made in accordance with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which grants people the right to a family life, could be lifted when the ex-officer makes his first appearance in court in September. The decision to charge E7 was welcomed by Rodney’s mother, who has campaigned for justice for nearly a decade and may be in line for a huge compensation payout from the Met. But it has left Scotland Yard chiefs worried about possible ‘industrial action’ by some police firearms officers who might lay down their weapons in support of their former colleague. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for armed policing, said the move to charge E7 had left officers shocked. He told The Times: ‘Firearms officers volunteer for the role and many are now considering their future career choices. ‘Officers are not above the law and they are accountable for their individual decisions, but carrying a gun on behalf of the state is a big ask and it just got bigger.’ The decision to charge E7 comes after a three-month public inquiry into Rodney’s death, led by former judge Sir Christopher Holland. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ‘We have carefully considered the new file of evidence submitted to us and have decided that a former Metropolitan Police officer, currently identified only as E7, will be prosecuted for murder. The individual currently has anonymity.’ The murder suspect will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 10. The shooting took place outside The Railway Tavern on . Hale Lane in . Edgware, north London. Forensic experts are pictured at the crime scene after the incident took place in April 2005 . After . the findings of a public inquiry into Mr Rodney's death were published, . his mother Susan . Alexander, pictured middle, called for an investigation to be opened. She is pictured with lawyer Daniel Machover, right and Leslie Thomas, . from Garden Court Chambers, left . Rodney’s mother Susan Alexander said: ‘I am very pleased at the decision to prosecute the officer who killed my son. I have waited a long time to see this day and hope this prosecution will lead to justice for Azelle.’ Rodney was hit by eight shots in less than two seconds from a high-powered carbine at almost point blank range. The rounds were fired from the open window of a patrol car within a split second of pulling alongside the VW Golf carrying Rodney. The murder charge against E7 is . believed to be only the third time in recent years that an officer has . been charged with murder while on active duty. PC . Chris Sherwood from Sussex Police was acquitted of murder in 2001, . after he shot James Ashley, 39, while he was naked and unarmed. The shooting had taken place while police searched his flat in Hastings, East Sussex. The officer said he believed Mr Ashley was mistakenly pointing a gun at him and was about to shoot. The . Chief Constable of Sussex, Martin Richards, who was the nominal . defendant in the civil case that followed, admitted negligence and . agreed to pay the family damages. But the force always strongly denied misconduct. In . an earlier case - and believed to be the first of its kind - . Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared at the Old Bailey of . the murder and manslaughter of suspected car thief David Ewin, 38. He stood trial three times after the jury failed to deliver a verdict on the first two occasions. He had always denied both the murder and manslaughter of Mr Ewin in Barnes, south west London, in February 2005. The . officer, then 49, was part of the crew of an armed response vehicle . that had spotted the stolen Toyota sports car parked outside a shop. Mr Ewin died from his injuries after the shooting. Officer E7 claimed he feared Rodney was about to fire a submachine gun. Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, the other occupants of the VW Golf, were jailed for seven and six years respectively in January 2006 after pleading guilty to possession of firearms. Lovell was also convicted of allowing drug production in his Hammersmith home. In court he claimed that he had let Rodney use his flat as a crack factory to cancel out a drugs debt. At the time of his death Rodney was wanted over a double stabbing in Ealing. There have only been two previous cases where police officers were charged with murder. In 1997 Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared of the 1995 murder of suspected car thief David Ewin in Barnes, south-west London. The second related to PC Chris Sherwood, who was accused of murder after he shot suspected drug dealer James Ashley while he was naked and unarmed when officers searched his flat in St Leonards, East Sussex, in 1998. He was cleared in 2001. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents more than 125,000 rank and file officers, held discussions about firearms officers conducting ‘unofficial strikes’ when marksmen faced the prospect of being charged with murder in two other cases. The shootings of unarmed decorator Harry Stanley in 1999 and Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 were mired in controversy but possible walkouts were averted when prosecutors ruled out murder charges. E7 has been supported in his legal battle by the Metropolitan branch of the Police Federation, whose chairman John Tully said: ‘Parallels may be drawn with the Harry Stanley case going back a number of years when two officers were arrested. ‘At the time there were concerns about the lack of support from senior management and Government. It’s a very difficult job.’ But he added: ‘I have not detected any similar feelings in the workforce currently. It could have an impact on morale.’ The Police Firearms Officers Association said the case had raised many issues. A spokesman said: ‘The decision by the CPS to prosecute E7 raises many issues around the role of armed policing and officers having confidence in the law should they be involved in a shooting.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","24-year-old died in Edgware, London, in April 2005 after being shot six times .

"Energy secretary Ed Davey claimed the green business interests of energy watchdog chief John Gummer were not conflict of interest . Energy Secretary Ed Davey has admitted he knew former Tory Minister John Selwyn Gummer had green business interests when he chose him to head the powerful government watchdog that sets targets for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions. But he insisted they did not amount to a conflict of interest – on the grounds they only concerned ‘infrastructure’, not renewable power generation. Last night critics dismissed this view as ‘absurd’. The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year that Mr Gummer, now Lord Deben, is chairman of both Veolia Water UK, which connects windfarms to the National Grid, and the Climate Change Committee. The committee’s stringent, binding targets are the main reason why the Grid is set to spend £25 billion on its network by 2020 – a big factor in soaring household energy bills. This newspaper’s disclosure about Veolia Water UK triggered a long correspondence – published last week after a Freedom of Information Act request – between MPs, Lord Deben and Mr Davey. The latter said in a letter in May that he knew about Veolia’s energy business, but there was no conflict of interest because the firm was ‘mainly involved in infrastructure projects’. Labour MP Graham Stringer, a prominent climate sceptic, was scathing about Mr Davey’s role: ‘The whole of our energy policy has been distorted by green lobbyists. To say there is no conflict because Veolia is only involved in energy infrastructure is patently absurd.’ Last night The Mail on Sunday asked Lord Deben how much Veolia is paying him and how he could avoid making Climate Committee decisions that might benefit the firm. He did not respond. Mr Gummer, pictured second from left with David Cameron, Wetlands Trust chief executive Martin Spray and MP Zac Goldsmith, is the chairman of Veolia Water UK, which connects wind farms to the National Grid .","John Selwyn Gummer is chairman of a firm which connects wind farms .

"She has been socializing with royalty and celebrities as she makes her foray back into the spotlight - after admitting she was 'the most humiliated woman in the world' But after being spotted at celeb hot spot Little House in London's Mayfair last night, Monica Lewinsky may want to lay low - as Hillary Clinton is heading into town, MailOnline can reveal. The potential Presidential candidate and one-time Lewinsky nemesis is currently en route to London to publicize her new book, Hard Choices. Scroll down for video . Moving on: Monica Lewinsky has made a decision to stop laying low and 'It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress' Sitting pretty: Lewinsky says she decided to 'stick her head above the parapet' and come out of her self-imposed exile . And Mrs Clinton certainly means business as BBC broadcaster Jeremy Vine today announced she would be spending the entirety of his BBC Radio 2 lunchtime show in the studio with him tomorrow. She will also be interviewed on Radio 4's Woman's Hour. Mrs Clinton, 66, seemed excited by her visit as shortly before taking off to the UK early this morning she tweeted a photo of herself signing copies of Hard Choices at Hudson News at New York's JFK airport. She wrote: 'Stopped by @HudsonBooks at JFK before my flight to London. We're taking the #HardChoices book tour across the pond!' Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal Monica, now 40, the former White House intern infamous for her liaison with President Bill Clinton, was seen looking slender and stylish at the trendy Soho House off-shoot in the capital last night. The club is a members-only spot and means that Monica would have had to be invited by one of the high-profile members. After 10 . years of self-imposed exile, Monica has made it clear she's back - and wants to move beyond her affair with President Clinton. She cut a slim figure at the Masterpiece Marie Curie party at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London on Monday night. She mingled with Princess Beatrice and guests including actor Clive Owen and model Yasmin Le Bon at the event to benefit the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity,  which provides home nurses to people with terminal cancer. Breaking her silence in a revealing Vanity Fair article recently, she wrote: 'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress. 'I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton. Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.' And as part of her return to the public eye, Monica calls herself 'the most humiliated woman in the world' in a new National Geographic documentary, 'The 90s: The Last Great Decade?', which will air starting next Sunday. London Calling: Hillary Clinton is en route to London as Monica Lewinsky is the toast of the city . Older and wiser: Lewinsky turned 40 last year and wants her life to move beyond the affair with Clinton . Charity gala: Monica Lewinsky and the evening's host Heather Kerzner arrive at The Masterpiece Marie Curie Party . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . On Tuesday, the Today show gave a first glimpse at the three-part special, in which Monica opens up about the day a 445-page report by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr was published. 'That . was one of the worst days of my life,' she said. 'I was a virgin to . humiliation of that level, until that day... I was the most humiliated . woman in the world. When Page Six asked about Monica's stylish appearance in London this week, her spokeswoman responded, 'Her focus is on work right now. 'She was pleased to support the work of her dear friend Heather Kerzner and all she does for Marie Curie Cancer Care. Growing up the daughter of a radiation oncologist, Monica viewed Marie Curie as a hero.' The timing of Monica's decision to return to the spotlight is interesting, as it coincides with the release of Hillary Clinton's memoir as speculation as to whether she will run in 2016 ramps up. Monica says that after laying low when Mrs Clinton ran for office in 2008, she's . unprepared to put her life on hold for another possibly eight to 10 . years. 'I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past—and other people’s futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.' Meanwhile, Mrs Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and wants everyone else to do the same. The former Secretary of State also revealed she did read the essay that Monica wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated. In an interview for People magazine in early June, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future.' However, Republicans have signaled they don't consider her husband's scandal from the late 1990s out of bounds in the realm of 2016-style political dialogue. Memoir: Hillary Clinton has been doing the rounds on a press tour of her new book Hard Choices. She says she has 'moved on' from the Lewinsky scandal . Life-altering: Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures . Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely GOP presidential contender, answered criticisms of the Republican record on women's issues by saying in January that the last Democratic president engaged in 'predatory behavior' with a woman, Lewinsky, who was 22 when her liaisons with Clinton began in 1995. Mrs Clinton also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public. Monica says she wants to use her experiences to help others facing public humiliation, citing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi, who killed himself after he was streamed via webcam kissing another man and was ridiculed on social media. 'Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?' she wrote. 'My current goal is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.'","Former White House intern Lewinsky is this week socializing with royalty and celebs and was out last night at Mayfair hot spot Little House .

"Stuart Broad wasn't exactly looking his best when England lined up for the official photocall ahead of England's fifth Test against India. The batsman sustained a broken nose at Old Trafford in the previous Test, and is still wearing the battle scars. His large plaster across his face bore uncanny resemblance to 1980s pop sensation Adam Ant. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 'England recovery underway - Cook' New look? Stuart Broad bore an uncanny resemblance to 1980's pop star Adam Ant at the England photocall . Sore: Stuart Broad is still bloody and bruised after breaking his nose on Saturday in the fourth Test versus India . Set to play: Despite the nasty injury and two black eyes, Broad is expected to feature against India on Friday . He's clearly been taking it all in good stride, tweeting a picture of Batman and Bane earlier this week. Broad will follow the example of footballers such as Paul Gascoigne and wear a protective face mask to ensure that he can play in the final Test at The Oval. The nasty blow Broad took when he top-edged a bouncer from Varun Aaron into the gap between the peak of his helmet and grille during England’s thumping fourth Test win looked to have ruled him out. But he emerged from a Manchester hospital and ruled out reconstructive surgery before insisting he will be fit to play, complete with a mask, on Friday.

Confident: England captain Alastair Cook believes Stuart Broad should be available for the final Test on Friday . Captain Alastair Cook sounded confident about Broad's well-being, having watched him practise. ‘We think he's going to be absolutely fine,’ he said. ‘We reserve the right tomorrow morning, in case something unusual happens overnight. (But) we're not expecting anything like that at all.’ The only apparent uncertainty is over which protective covering Broad may yet choose when the match gets under way. ‘He batted, he bowled his six or seven overs and didn't get any pain from it,’ said Cook. ‘So we're expecting him to be absolutely fine, and see what mask he pulls on tomorrow. I don't know what's been going on ... but there have been quite a few masks. ‘I'm not quite sure if he's just going to wear it when he's batting, or if he's bowling, but I honestly don't think it's going to affect his performance at all - which is good.’ Batman the batsman - or the Bane of India's lives?

"Riot police kept anti-immigrant protestors away from their rivals today as tensions remained high on the streets of Calais. A group called ‘Sauvons Calais’ (Save Calais) displayed their opposition to some 2,000 foreigners living around the port as they try to get to Britain. Meanwhile, it was revealed that the Government will offer to improve security by sending Calais officials the 9ft-high steel fences used to protect world leaders at last week’s Nato summit in Wales. Scroll down for video . Trying to get out: Migrants break into a lorry on Friday as it fills up with fuel at one of a number of automatic diesel stations on a road close to the port of Calais, known to truckers as Gasoline Alley . More than 12 miles of fencing was set up around venues for the summit in Newport and Cardiff, and the Home Office says this is much stronger than the current barriers in place at the French port. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told The Sunday Telegraph that Britain would help by sending the fences, but warned it is up to the French to secure the port against illegal migrants. The Sauvons Calais meeting today took place in front of the town hall, where some 300 police officers formed a ring of steel. At one point, left-wing activists tried to attack the demonstration, leading to an uneasy stand-off between the two groups. ‘Left-wing scum are trying to stop us speaking up for the people of Calais,’ said Kevin Reche, a former member of the French National Front who was kicked out of the party for making a Nazi salute. ‘There are all kinds of people demonstrating for a safe Calais – from the far right, to those without any political views. We are all calling for justice.’ Helping hand: The Government will offer to improve security in Calais by sending the 9ft-high steel fences used to protect world leaders at last week's Nato summit (pictured) There were some 250 people at the anti-immigration rally, including skinheads with White Power flags. One wore a T-shirt saying ‘Charlemagne 1944’, in reference to a Second World War Nazi division made up entirely of French volunteers. ‘Heil-Hitler’ salutes also appeared . to be made by around ten demonstrators during the stand-off with their . opponents, but organisers claimed they were just being used to mock the . ‘left wing fascists’. 'Police are already warning of violence, but if there is any, it will come from the immigrants who are destroying a once great French town' Gilles Baudin, Sauvons Calais . There were also more moderate voices among those objecting to the presence of the migrants in Calais. ‘We just want a better future for own children,’ said Noelle Richard, 46, who was with her schoolgirl daughter. ‘Having lots of young men sleeping . rough in the town makes for a very unpleasant atmosphere. There is . always a great deal of trouble at all times of the day and night.’ The protests came as former home . secretary Michael Howard, now Lord Howard, said France needed to ‘get . its act together’ to deal with the growing crisis. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has . threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly . Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry last Wednesday. Mrs . Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to . deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally. French . nationalists, including many supporters of Marine Le Pen’s increasingly . successful National Front party, want more direct action. ‘That’s why we’re in Calais,’ said Gilles Baudin, one of those preparing to march. ‘Police are already warning of . violence, but if there is any, it will come from the immigrants who are . destroying a once great French town. ‘These people should be cleared out - we don’t care where they go, but we don’t want them in our country.’ Denis Gaudin, sub-prefect for the Calais area, said the route of the march had already been switched ‘for security reasons’. Mr . Gaudin said there was a ‘fraught climate’ in the town – one that was . likely to explode into violence if the demonstrators got near the . migrants. In turn, immigrant Lola Welday, a 40-year-old from Eritrea, said: ‘I have children here, and all we want is to be protected. Demonstration: Around 200 migrants marched through Calais on Friday chanting 'We want to go to the UK' ‘We are peaceful people, and all we . want is a new life in England – we want to live and prosper there in . peace. We get trouble from the French police, but what we really need is . increased protection.’ Lola and her daughter, Kidan, six, . were among 200 migrants who themselves marched through Calais on Friday . chanting ‘UK, UK - We want to go to the UK’, and ‘We demand our human . rights’. 'We are peaceful people, and all we want is a new life in England - we want to live and prosper there in peace' Lola Welday, immigrant from Eritrea . Sauvons Calais is demanding that the migrants are expelled from the Calais area, and that anyone sheltering or feeing them is arrested. There have already been attacks on squatters in Calais, and some temporary camps have been illegally burned down. Sauvons Calais will deploy a ‘security detail’ today aimed at countering the threat of a ‘far left rabble,’ according to one organiser, although he insisted ‘we will not cause any trouble’. Mrs Bouchart said: ‘My proposal to block the port still remains. We are sick of being ignored. Those of us living in Calais have been in this situation for 12 years. Wanting to make it to Britain: A new migrant camp in sand dunes close to the port of Calais, France, that the Sudanese inhabitants call 'White Africa', because conditions are as bad there as the war zones they have left . ‘Until now we have had no help, no . word of compassion and no support. It is time for the UK government to . face up to its responsibilities, otherwise this crisis will just go on . and on.’ 'It is time for the UK government to face up to its responsibilities, otherwise this crisis will just go on and on' Natacha Bouchart, Calais mayor . Britain’s ‘soft’ immigration policy means it is viewed as ‘El Dorado’, said Mrs Bouchard. She . has also demanded that the UK Border Force’s frontline passport check, . which has been inside the port of Calais for more than a decade, should . be moved back to Dover. The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out in other Channel ports including Dunkirk and Cherbourg. All play a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with the police as they attempt to break into lorries so as to get to the UK, where they will claim asylum or disappear into the black economy. Getting into a lorry: The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out in other Channel ports including Dunkirk and Cherbourg . A British woman told last week of her shock at finding a stowaway hidden in her Fiat Panda after she had travelled from France to the UK. 'We demand our human rights' What migrants chanted on Friday . The migrants are mainly from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, and have travelled from north Africa to mainland Europe, usually through Italy. Violent clashes between rival migrant groups and people smugglers have also broken out in the town. According to the Calais Prefecture, 7,414 undocumented migrants were arrested in Calais in the first six months of this year, compared with the 3,129 detained in the same period of 2013. Some 400 would-be stowaways were caught by French police last weekend alone. Those caught are then released, so they are free to try again and again until they succeed.","'Sauvons Calais' group is against 2,000 foreigners living at French port .

"Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has taunted Australian police via his social media account, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians. The Sydney jihadist is currently in the Middle East fighting with extremist group Islamic State after he evaded authorities in December by fleeing Australia on his brother's passport.

Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police. 'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said. He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'.

Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts. Speaking to media on Thursday, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'. 'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said. Director General of Security and ASIO chief David Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots. 'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said. When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'.

"A man claiming to be the illegitimate son of Mr. T filed a $5.4 million lawsuit last year claiming that the TV star had abandoned him at a young age causing him to become emotionally unstable and join a gang. In the legal papers,  Alexander Taylor, 25, of San Diego, California, claimed that the actor - real name Laurence Tureaud - walked out of his life because ‘he did not fit into Mr. T’s public image.’ According to the June 2013 lawsuit, Taylor ‘was born May 25, 1988 to Vanessa Taylor (mother) and Mr. T (father)’. Actor Mr. T - real name Laurence Tureaud - has been accused of walking out on his 'illegitimate son' Alexander Taylor, right, who filed a lawsuit against him last year . Taylor claims ‘Mr. T had a . responsibility and obligation as a father to help provide Alexander with . the basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter’, but instead he chose . to ‘neglect and abuse’ him during his childhood, reports RadarOnline. ‘Perhaps . things would be different if Alexander did not know his father; Mr. T . spent quite a bit of time with Alexander for example Mr. T would take . Alexander to preschool,’ state the document. Born-again . Christian Mr. T rose to prominence in the 1980s playing the iconic role . of B.A. Baracus - the mohican-haired mercenary weighed down by gold . neck chains and a phobia of flying – in the hit TV show The A-Team. ‘At the time Alexander was unaware that his father was famous, he was just a proud little boy… Then all of a sudden Mr. T walked out of Alexander’s life and never looked back.’ Mr. T rose to prominence in the 1980s playing the iconic role of B.A. Baracus - the mohican-haired mercenary weighed down by gold neck chains and a phobia of flying ¿ in the hit TV show The A-Team . In the papers Alexander Taylor claims that the only thing the actor taught him was 'how to pee standing up' In the papers Taylor also claims that the only thing the actor taught him was 'how to pee standing up'. As a result of being abandoned, Taylor states that he had a hard time transitioning into adulthood and was suspended numerous times from school and was sent to juvenile hall before he eventually joined a gang. ‘Mr. T’s emotional child abuse has caused emotional distress resulting in more serious psychological and behavioral problems. 'These include depression, lack of attachment or emotional bond to family and friends, low cognitive ability and poor social skills,’ the lawsuit continued. Taylor even requesting a jury trial, but . the suit was dismissed two months later because Taylor failed to pay . the required $400 filing and administrative fee. When Mail Online spoke to Taylor he revealed that he has taken his case to the Court of Appeal. The lawsuit wasn’t the first time that Taylor’s family had attempted some legal recourse against Mr. T. In . 1990, Alexander’s mom Vanessa Taylor - who like Mr. T hails from . Chicago - filed a Petition to Establish Parentage regarding Alexander. That case was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, but had been mysteriously taken of the court docket by 1994. Mr. T married Phyllis Clark in 1971 and they have three children - Lesa, Erika, and T Junior. Taylor was arrested ten times between 2007 and 2009 for a string of unspecified offenses.

"One of the puppies adopted by Olympic skiier Gus Kenworthy has died before making it to the United States. A female stray that he named 'Sochi' died before getting medical treatment in America. Kenworthy grew attached to a family of stray dogs that he found in Sochi ahead of his silver medal win for slopestyle skiing. Too soon: Gus Kenworthy's would-be adopted dog 'Sochi', seen here with Kenworthy's friend Robin Macdonald, died on March 9 ahead of the scheduled trip back to the US . He stayed behind an extra few days after the Games ended in order to help with the paperwork for bringing the dogs back to America, but he has since returned and his friend Robin Macdonald has taken on the task of bringing the dogs home. Macdonald, who works as a photographer and cinematographer, announced the death on March 9 on Twitter. 'No words can explain what has happened here, good bye little guy, we will miss you,' he wrote with a picture of him holding Sochi. 'She died, they refused to let me bring her to get treatment,' he clarified in another tweet. Puppy love: Kenworthy brought some social media attention to the stray dogs in Sochi after posing for pictures with them during the Games . Kenworthy's spokesman Michael Spencer confirmed the dog's death to ABC News. While one dog did not make it, Macdonald is flying back from Russia with five dogs: Jake, Rosa, Mishka, Stryder and Mom, the mother of the liter. Kenworthy previously told the Today Show that he will be keeping Rosa and another dog, one will be going to Kenworthy's brother's family and the mother will go to his mom. Headed to their new home: Five dogs, including the mother of the litter, are all being brought to Colorado . Ready to travel: The five dogs are being taken back to the US by Kenworthy's friend who stayed on later to make sure all of the adoption papers went through the proper channels . Macdonald posted photos of the dog's crates on Wednesday showing them at the airport on their way back to the U.S. The pups have resulted in a great deal of attention for Kenworthy, the 22-year-old who helped the U.S. sweep the slopestyle event with his silver contribution. He credited Macdonald with being the one to alert him to the particularly photogenic stray family. 'There were a lot of strays there, but the [ones that I adopted] were living outside the media center. My friend Robin who was out there doing media stuff during the Games saw them and sent me a photo of them because he knows I’m obsessed with dogs,' Kenworthy told Elle.","Dog that he named 'Sochi' died before receiving medical treatment .

They  allow wearers to lie flat on their back without having to strain their neck to see a screen or page in front of them .
Similar Hamblin glasses were invented in 1936 but never took off ."
