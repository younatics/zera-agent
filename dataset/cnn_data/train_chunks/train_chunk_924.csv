"By . Jenny Awford . A grass snake had to be rescued by a vet when it got stuck trying to squeeze through a drain with a frog in its throat. The two-foot long snake was carried to Sidmouth Veterinary Practice in Devon - still stuck in the metal grid - after a man spotted the reptile trapped in the grating in his garden. It had just swallowed a frog which added a couple of inches to its girth. Scroll down for video . The grass snake had to be rescued by a vet when it got stuck in a garden drain in Devon with a frog in its throat . Measuring about two ft  in length, the snake became stuck after eating something which added a couple of inches to its girth . Surgeon Richard Jones planned to cut off the grid with a hacksaw but then slipped the snake free with some lubricant. The two-foot snake decided against swallowing the frog and regurgitated it shortly after being freed. It was then released back into the garden where it was found. Mr Jones said: 'A gentleman found the snake stuck in a drain in his garden and brought it into us. Surgeon Richard Jones from Sidmouth Veterinary Practice in Devon rescued the snake with some lubricant . 'It had become completely stuck. It was clear it had eaten something as it had an extra couple of inches around it's girth. 'I thought I was going to have to soar off the grate but after using lots of lubricant, I managed to free it within around 10 minutes.' He added: 'It was absolutely fine but regurgitated the frog soon after. 'The gentleman then took the snake home and released it back into his garden.' Measuring up to 6ft long grass snakes are the largest species of snake in Britain, but unlike adders they are not venomous. They pose no threat to humans but they are dangerous to the small animals on which they feast because of their speed and quick reflexes. As the only species of snake in Britain to lay eggs, they have jaws big enough to regularly swallow small animals whole. But they are preyed on too, and play dead when cornered by predators. The snakes subsist mainly on amphibious animals like frogs, toads and newts, as well as the occasional fish.","The grass snake became trapped in a garden drain in Devon .

"By . Ashley Collman . A horse named Spartacus fell over near Central Park on Wednesday, adding fuel to the debate over whether the carriage industry should remain in New York City. Those siding with Mayor Bill De Blasio's plan to ban horse-drawn carriages and replace them with electric cars gathered Thursday at the site of the accident to protest what they believe is a cruel industry. 'We are here today because yesterday eyewitnesses report that a bus drove very close to a carriage, spooking a horse who then began to run,' PETA spokeswoman Ashley Byrne said at the demonstration Thursday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Toppled: A carriage horse named Spartacus fell in Central Park on Wednesday. Animal rights activists claim the 15-year-old horse was spooked by a passing bus . Doing fine: A carriage industry spokesman said . the accident had nothing to do with a bus and that Spartacus was . inspected by a veterinarian who determined the animal was uninjured . 'After the horse bucked and started to run the carriage tipped over onto the curb, pinning the horse down. This is more tragic evidence of why it is time to take these dangerous cruel carriages off the streets of New York City,' Ms Byrne added. However, spokesman for the carriage industry maintains that the 15-year-old horse was not injured in the 'minor accident' and that buses don't even drive by E 59th Street and Fifth Avenue where the incident happened. Instead, they say a horse parked behind Spartacus unexpectedly pulled out of its spot and clipped Spartacus' back Wheel and tipped the carriage over - causing Spartacus to fall. Out and about: Spartacus' owner Tony Salerno (right) took him for a stroll on Thursday near a Midtown stable to show that the horse was fine . Their side of the story: The carriage industry says the horse fell over when another horse unexpectedly pulled out from behind and clipped a carriage wheel causing the carriage to topple over . Retire the horses: Animal rights activists gathered at the scene of the accident on Thursday, calling for an end of the carriage industry . Agenda: New York Mayor Bill De Blasio has expressed his intention to ban the carriage industry and replace them with electric cars . 'Several carriage drivers immediately came to the horse's aid, keeping him calm and laying down while they unharnessed him, got him untangled and righted the lightweight carriage before safely allowing him to get to his feet,' the Historic Horse Drawn Carriages of Central Park, LLC said in a statement. After the incident, Spartacus was taken to his stable in Midtown where he rested and was evaluated by a veterinarian. On Thursday, Spartacus' owner brandished Tony Salerno, 62, brandished a clean veterinarian's check and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene confirm that the horse was not injured. Still, the accident only heightened tension on the issue and even Mayor De Blasio commented it at an unrelated event on Thursday. Horseless carriage: The electric car, designed to look like a classic motor, is being offered as an alternative to horses in Central Park . 'The one yesterday was not the first one -- it was one in a long line of accidents,"" De Blasio said.'And it's for a very simple reason -- horses don't belong on the streets of New York City. While De Blasio wasn't passionate about the cause when he was a member of City Council in 2007, he became the face of a horse-free park in 2011 when he said it was time to pursue 'more humane alternatives to the horse-drawn carriages'. That statement seems to have helped the mayor when he was running for office last year, and anti-carriage groups funded a serious ad campaign against Christine Quinn - his main Democrat rival. De Blasio got another supporter as well in the form of Broadway actress Kristen Chenoweth who tweeted Thursday: 'Please NYC. Let's get these horses off [the] street !!' Voicing her opinion: Broadway actress Kristen Chenoweth joined the anti-carriage side of the debate on Thursday when she sent out this tweet . Support: Actor Liam Neeson has said carriage horses should stay in the city . Actor Liam Neeson, who starred in Shindler's List and Taken, has become one of the horse-drawn carriage industry's main supporters after recently touring a stables where they are housed. 'It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working,' Neeson wrote in an April 14 editorial in The New York Times. Neeson believes the horse-carriage business is 'humane' and 'well regulated'. While four horses have been killed in collisions with motor vechiles, Neeson said that is a remarkably safe record for New York's traffic. And Neeson certainly isn't alone in wanting to keep the horses. A 'Save our Horses' petition started by the New York Daily News has garnered more than 20,000 signatures as of Thursday. On the same day as the accident, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy took his wife Carla Bruni and their daughter Giulia out for a ride on one of the carriages and all three smiled the entire time. After the ride, when asked if he thought the carriage industry should remain in New York, Sarkozy offered up an enthusiastic 'yes,' the Daily News reported.

"By . Angela Epstein for the Daily Mail . My porch floor looked like something from a crime scene, thanks to the clear outline marked on the ceramic tiles. The evidence of foul play was as shocking as it was uncompromising. This was not the site of a grisly murder, but it was something almost as disturbing to a houseproud, middle-class wife and mother like me. There was a sharply delineated oblong of dust, indicating that my cleaner had mopped around the edges of the mat, rather than lifting it up and washing underneath. Scroll down for video . Cleaner has the power: Angela is too scared to criticise her work in case she leaves (stock picture) What's more, I could still hear the roar of the Hoover from one of the bedrooms above, meaning the perpetrator was still in my house. In the kitchen, evidence of yet another misdemeanour greeted me: a dirty dishcloth in the sink which had not been rinsed with hot water and soaked in bleach as I'd requested. Add to this the fact that my cleaner had arrived 15 minutes late that morning without bothering to apologise or explain, and you'd imagine I flew up the stairs to tear a strip or two off her. But you'd be wrong. Instead of taking her to task and listing her many failings (why does she think the corners of the carpets don't need to be vacuumed?) I popped my head around the bedroom door. Taking in the sight of her dreamily trailing a duster along the window ledges, I flashed my brightest smile and asked if she fancied a cuppa. When she said yes, I trundled obediently down the stairs, disguising the anger I felt at myself for failing to stand up to this woman who takes my hard-earned money every week yet treats cleaning my house as if she's doing me a huge favour. Home help: Angela can't imagine a happy domestic life without her cleaner . So why is it that I, a strong-minded and fearless journalist who has faced down dangerous criminals and appeared on BBC's Question Time, am incapable of taking my domestic help to task? The answer? I'm terrified she will leave me. One wrong word from me and she'll be off - and welcomed into the grateful arms of one of the many working women in neighbouring streets who've been circling her like predatory lionesses. A cleaner is a precious commodity in this smart suburb of Manchester, and I am told the situation is the same in other middle-class areas around the country. Cleaners - even lackadaisical ones like mine - are fought over. And the fight is getting dirty as women go to increasingly desperate lengths to keep their cleaner away from enemy clutches. These days, as long as the domestic help isn't stealing the family silver, desperate working women like me will put up with anything rather than taking time out of their busy schedules to find another one. I've lost count of the number of times I've spoken to otherwise tough, successful, straight-talking friends who confess to being as weak as kittens when it comes to negotiating terms and pay with their cleaners. One, a high-flying taxation lawyer, employs a delightful girl who is punctual and charming but insists on spending half an hour each week rearranging the bottles inside the bathroom cabinet. The first time she did this, my friend - who lectures at industry events around the world - nervously suggested, with a quasi-giggle, that devoting time to such an endeavour wasn't really necessary. Would it not be more helpful, she tentatively suggested, if she spent the time vacuuming the stairs, digging the hair out the shower drain or cleaning the glass on the patio doors? In other words, the unpleasant jobs that actually needed doing. The cleaner smiled and nodded. Yet the following week the bottles were lined up like the YSL counter in Harvey Nicks, and a plug of hair the size of a large hamster was left sitting in the shower drain. Deaf ears? Or a cleaner who knew only too well she had her employer over a barrel? Another friend actually paid for her Polish cleaner to go back to her village outside Krakow last Christmas, maintaining it was a thank-you for all her hard work. Actually, it was code for: 'Don't leave me - ever.' I've also seen good friends become sworn enemies after one has poached the other's cleaning lady. Six million people in Britain now pay someone to help with household chores . 'How could she do that to me?' I overheard one distraught woman ranting in a cafe a few months back. 'The betrayal, the sneaking behind my back. I'll never be able to trust anyone again!' I tuned in, convinced I was about to eavesdrop on a particularly salacious tale of suburban bed-hopping, only to learn the woman was furious her neighbour had stolen her cleaner - having secretly wooed her for weeks. I have heard of women inventing aliases for their help, and have one friend who will never tell me her 'brilliant' cleaner's name for fear I might snaffle her. She even refuses to say on what days she is employed, so no one can accost and poach her on the way home. Like so many working women, I hate myself for giving my cleaner so much power. But what is the alternative? Every working mother I know needs a cleaner despite putting on endless rounds of washing and keeping on top of the day-to-day mess created by their families. As well as holding down a full-time job, I provide a taxi service for Sophie, ten and Aaron, 16, as well as a general takeaway food and hotel service to their brothers, Sam, 21 and Max, 19. Why should I spend my days cleaning? Having built a successful 20-year career as a writer and broadcaster, simply playing house would be a waste of my talents. Without a cleaner, women like me are one heartbeat away from meltdown. We simply don't have time to do it all. In demand: Good cleaners can be hard to find . Sourcing a good one, however, is not easy. Anyone paid £7 to £10 an hour to clean up someone else's filth isn't going to be committed to the job. In a cleaner's shoes, wouldn't I swap allegiances if someone down the road was serving better biscuits and let me watch a flat-screen TV while doing the ironing? Damn right I would. So would I poach someone's cleaner? You bet I would! A few years ago I hired one who I'd heard moaning about cleaning up after her employer's toddlers, who loved to stuff fishfingers down the back of the sofa. Sidling up to her at the school gate, I gushed that I'd love her to work for me instead. 'My children are much older,' I said. 'Your life will be so much easier.' My ruse worked - until six months later I lost her to a single woman with no children. Only once did I venture a tiny wisp of complaint to a cleaner, doing so by text to soften the implied criticism. She insisted on stuffing into drawers anything that wasn't nailed to the carpet. Consequently I'd spend frustrated hours playing hunt the tax return/morning paper/party invitation. In the end I sent a chirpy little text asking if she'd seen an M&S bag I'd left on the bed. I didn't hear back for three days. Edging into panic for my rash action, I nearly expired with joy when she finally replied, apologising that her phone was broken. And now my latest cleaner wants to go. She left a voicemail offering some rambling excuse about wanting to cut her hours. My husband Martin saw it as a moment to rejoice, with a lecture about how paying this woman was like setting tenners on fire. He was right. There has to be somebody out there who could do a better job - or at the very least lift a mat when mopping the floor. I crept upstairs to text back my response: 'Will it make a difference if I pay a bit more?'","Angela is terrified her cleaner will leave her .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The first Range Rover production car, which set the benchmark for luxury 4x4s, is expected to sell for more than £150,000 when it comes up at auction. Land Rover launched the Range Rover in 1970, describing it as the most versatile car in the world. It was designed to combine the comfort and on-road ability of a Rover saloon with the off-road skill of a Land Rover. Land Rover launched the Range Rover in 1970, describing it as the most versatile car in the world . Today, it remains the benchmark in luxury off-roaders and looks at home on a farm, outside the Ritz or in the car park of a Premier League football ground. And it was this two-door, green model with the registration YVB 151H, which started it all - and it is expected to prompt a fierce bidding war among enthusiasts and investors. The car was built between November 24, 1969 and December 17, 1969 before being registered on January 2, 1970. The car was designed to combine the comfort and on-road ability of a Rover saloon with the off-road skill of a Land Rover . Petrolheads: Car collectors will appreciate the work that went into the car's engine . Now known as the Range Rover Classic, the stylish two-door model was originally delivered to Michael Forlong, who produced two Range Rover promotion films. It then had a number of owners before vanishing until the 1990s when an enthusiast discovered it. He then spent six years carrying out a meticulous nut-and-bolt restoration on the off-roader. The owner has now decided to sell the first Range Rover - known as #001 - and there is expected to be serious interest in it. Silverstone Auctions will sell the car at its Salon Privé sale in London on September 4. It was this two-door, green model with the registration YVB 151H, which started it all - and it is expected to prompt a fierce bidding war among enthusiasts and investors . The car is being offered with an estimate of around £100,000 to £140,000, but it is thought it could still fetch considerably more. It is also likely to catch the eye of Jaguar Land Rover, which recently bought dental entrepreneur Dr James Hull's huge collection of Jaguars. In a statement, the auction house said: 'Having owned this iconic motor car for more than 20 years our vendor has decided it is time to pass the responsibility of owning YVB 151H to a new custodian. 'The sympathetic and meticulous restoration has proudly stood the test of time making #001 a hugely significant motor car worthy of serious consideration.' The car is known as a 'matching numbers' model. This means the original chassis, engine and gearbox along with the original aluminium bonnet and bodyshell. Despite having only two doors, the first Range Rover production car set the benchmark for luxury 4x4s . Under the bonnet is a 3.5-litre V8 engine which developed around 135bhp and gave it a top speed in excess of 100mph. Nick Whale, the managing director of Silverstone Auctions, added: 'It is wonderful to be able to offer this iconic British model for auction at the UK's finest concourse event.

"By . Associated Press . and Michael Zennie . The second U.S. Ebola victim is back on American soil after her plane landed at Bangor International Airport in Maine early on Tuesday. The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated. Mrs Writebol, from North Carolina, left Monrovia airport in West Africa early on Tuesday on a chartered plane. She will be treated at Emory University Hospital along with fellow missionary and doctor Dr Kent Brantly in a special quarantine wing. Scroll down for video . The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated . The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated . Back in the States: Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, is due to arrive in Atlanta today to be treated at Emory University Hospital alongside Dr Kent Brantly . Mrs Writebol's son, Jeremy, said his mother 'is still struggling' but that 'there seems to be improvement'. The two Americans infected with Ebola are getting an experimental drug so novel it has never been tested for safety in humans. The aid worker is reportedly in a stable condition after receiving a second dose of the drug. Ebola has killed at least 887 people in four West African countries in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Mrs Writebol has shown some improvement . over the weekend. She can walk with assistance and asked for Liberian . potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said. Care: Writebol will join fellow infected aid worker Dr Kent Bradley (pictured) at Emory University Hospital for treatment . However, her case remains grave. She is in serious condition with a disease that has no known cure and proves fatal for up to 90 per cent of patients. Jeremy Writebol believes his mother can yield a greater good from her impending return to the United States amid West Africa's worst-ever outbreak of the virus. The attention focused on her case 'might help develop a cure and resources to help those who are suffering,' Mr Writebol said. 'I am sure hopeful for that.' Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol contracted . Ebola after working on the same medical mission team treating victims of . the virus around Monrovia, Liberia. More than 1,300 people have been . stricken, killing at least 729 of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra . Leone. Quarantine: This is the specially-designed tent that was set up to quarantine the Ebola patients while they fly home aboard the GulfStream air ambulance . The specially-designed air ambulance, seen here taking off from Dobbin Air Reserve Base in Georgia, picked up Mrs Writebol in Liberia . Ebola has no vaccine or antidote. However, both Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were given an experimental treatment last week, according to international relief group Samaritan's Purse. The group originally said that only Writebol got the treatment. Dr Brantly also received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who had been under his care, according to the organization. Emory, where Brantly already is quarantined, boasts one of the nation's most sophisticated infectious disease units. Patients are sealed off from anyone not in protective gear. Lab tests are conducted inside the unit, ensuring that viruses don't leave the quarantined area. Family members see and communicate with patients through barriers. Mrs Writebol and her husband, David, had been in Liberia since August 2013, sent there by the Christian organization SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. Missionaries: Nancy and her husband David were being sponsored to work in Africa by their church in Charlotte, North Carolina . At the hospital where Brantly treated patients, Nancy Writebol worked as a hygienist whose role included decontaminating those entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area. Their pastor, the Reverend John Munro, said David Writebol fulfilled administrative and technical duties. A few weeks before she was diagnosed, Jeremy Writebol said, a doctor visited the Monrovia hospital where she worked and praised the decontamination procedures as the best he'd seen. Jeremy Writebol said she was 'really pleased by knowing that' and never thought she would be infected, despite her proximity to the virus. David and Nancy Writebol have engaged in foreign missions for 15 years, spending five years in Ecuador and nine years in Zambia, where Munro said they worked in a home for widows and orphans. Recovering: Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital, after receiving a dose of an experimental serum . Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention, also in Atlanta, say they've been criticized for bringing Ebola cases to an American hospital. But Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, emphasized again on Sunday that there is no threat to the public in the United States. Some airlines that serve those nations have suspended flights, while international groups, including the Peace Corps, have evacuated some or all representatives in the region. But the Writebols, their pastor predicted, won't be away from the stricken land for any longer than they have to be. 'They knew that Liberia was a tough assignment,' he said, comparing their vocation to the Bible's stories of leper colonies. 'Followers of Christ went into those colonies, knowing they would die,' Munro said. 'I certainly wouldn't judge them if they didn't go back, but I don't think this will deter them.' Quarantine facilities around the U.S: A widespread Ebola outbreak in the country is 'not in the cards', the CDC director said. That is partly down to the number of quarantine facilities, where the CDC can legally detain anyone who might have been exposed to a number of diseases .","American Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, 59, is being transported to a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Hotels in the notorious party resort of Magaluf are set out to kick out a record number of yob British holidaymakers this year. Nearly 100 troublemakers have been asked to leave already this year for smashing up their hotel rooms, fighting with others guests or assaulting staff. And hotel bosses are promising to get even tougher with unruly tourists after the rowdy Majorcan resort made headlines around the world over a video of a British teenager performing multiple sex acts in a bar for free booze. More than 100 tourists have already been kicked out of their Magaluf hotels for trashing their rooms or fighting . A local hotel association says a staggering 92 of the 107 people members have kicked out so far this year were British. The other 15 were Irish. The shocking figures put Magaluf on course to break its record of expulsions, 254 last year and up from 147 in 2012 and 166 in 2011. The vast majority of those asked to leave in previous years, like this year, were British. And around 35 per cent of the area’s hotels do not belong to the association which released the figures yesterday, meaning the real number is likely to be slightly higher. Joan Espina, vice president of the Palmanova-Magaluf Hotel Assocation, which covers the two sister resorts, said: 'The vast majority of the expulsions are down to three reasons. A Magaluf hotel association claims a staggering 92 of the 107 people kicked out so far this year were British . The first is guests damaging hotel furniture, kicking doors down, smashing mirrors and even throwing TVs out of their rooms. 'The others are fights with other guests and verbal and physical attacks on hotel staff. 'The vast majority are always British men, aged between 18 and 25. Tourists pictured on the Punta Ballena strip in Magaluf after a night out on the town . 'We want young people who come to enjoy themselves but within a context of respect towards other guests. 'We won’t tolerate people whose fun comes from antisocial behaviour which causes others to suffer. 'It’s got to be fun within certain limits. 'Virtually all the problems we’re experiencing are connected to the misuse of drugs and alcohols and obviously we’d urge these youngsters to take care.' Troublemakers are put on a temporary black list so hoteliers know not to accept them. Mr Espina explained: 'The association sends round an email with the name of the person that’s been expelled so other members are pre-warned. 'We cover 20,000 hotel beds in Magaluf and Palmanova so it is a very effective measure. 'It’s only information that’s kept for a few days and not on a long-term basis. 'Most of the people that are expelled for bad behaviour promise they won’t do it again but we usually find a lot of them have already caused trouble before. 'Where there’s been vandalism hoteliers try to get compensation from those who’ve caused it but it’s very difficult in practice. 'Usually we try to avoid getting the police involved unless it’s very serious.' Several hotels in the area have hired private security to address the problem. One hotel boss said: 'It’s not that the problem has necessarily got worse but more that hotels are taking a tougher approach. 'In many cases hotels now employ external security staff rather than depending on a night-time caretaker and a sole security guard they mostly employed themselves.'","Hotels in Magaluf expecting to kick out record number of British this year .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A 71-year-old former lab worker has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison for conspiring with her physicist husband to sell secrets about nuclear weapons. Marjorie Roxby Mascheroni, who worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, pleaded guilty to plotting to reveal classified nuclear data. Her husband, 79-year-old scientist Pedro Leonardo Mascheroni, is in federal custody pending his sentencing after admitting to providing weapons plans to an FBI officer masquerading as a Venezuelan agent.

U.S. District Judge William P Johnson also sentenced Mrs Mascheroni to  three years of supervised release after her jail term, during the hearing at Albuquerque courthouse. Her one year sentence is well under the mandatory 14-year minimum she could have faced if she had been convicted at trial. The former lab worker admitted that between 2007 and 2009, she conspired with her husband to convey restricted data belonging to the United States to secure an advantage for Venezuela. She did technical writing and editing at the national laboratory which was the site of the secret Manhattan Project that developed the world's first atomic weapon during World War II. Los Alamos, in New Mexico was the site of the secret Manhattan Project that developed the world's first atomic weapon during World War II . Her husband was a scientist at the national security lab from 1979 to 1988. Mr Mascheroni was trying to help Venezuela build missiles and a nuclear bomb, along with a secret underground facility for a nuclear reactor and production of 'mini-bombs', according to federal authorities. But the officials said that the country, under former President Hugo Chavez, played no role in the scheme. According to their indictments, the 79-year-old physicist also suggested an explosion over New York that could produce an 'electromagnetic pulse' to knock out the metropolis' electrical power. He also put forward an idea to build a laser that could blind satellites and create a defence 'umbrella,' able to retaliate against attacks with nuclear bombs. Mr Mascheroni pleaded guilty to six counts in June 2013 and faces up to 5-and-a-half years in prison.","Marjorie Mascheroni, 71, has been sentenced to a year and a day in jail .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Six-year-old Lilly Bailey-Deacon was thrown off her bike and caught around the neck by a wire that was strung up in Titchfield Common, Fareham, Hampshire . A six-year-old girl was caught around the neck and 'nearly decapitated' by a wire that was deliberately strung across a park footpath. Lilly Bailey-Deacon had been cycling with her grandparents in Fareham, Hampshire, when she rode into the wire and was  thrown from her bike. She has been left badly shaken with cuts and bruises around her neck after the incident, which happened last Thursday. The wire, a brake cable taken from a vandalised child’s bicycle, had been tied about three feet off the floor and stretched for eight feet between a park bench and  railings in Titchfield Common. Lilly's furious father, Bradley Deacon, 29, from Havant, Hampshire, said he was 'livid' and issued an urgent plea to find the culprits. 'When you get a phone call to say that your daughter has nearly been decapitated by some stupid idiot, you're bound to be upset,' said Mr Deacon. 'I can't believe that someone could do something so stupid. 'I understand that kids play pranks but stringing up a wire like that is dangerous. 'I hope they catch whoever is responsible so that it doesn't happen again.' Two teenage boys sitting by Bellfield Play Area in Titchfield Common denied putting the cable up but left the scene when police were called. Lilly said she is healing but is nervous about going on her bike. She said: 'It was scary. It got me by the neck and it hurt. It was actually really dangerous. It could have cut someone's head off. It was horrible.' Her mother Emma McSwiggan, 28, said she was 'out of her mind' with worry when she got the news. The nurse, said: 'I was completely shocked and then it made me angry. 'I hope whoever did this gets caught so they get the warning they need to stop something like this happening to somebody else.' After a trip to see the animals at a local pet shop, Lilly had asked if she could cycle on ahead of her grandparents and they agreed. Her grandfather Bradley Deacon Snr, 50, said: 'There's no roads through the park and the path is wide, so I said - Yes, but be careful and we'll catch you up.' The wire, a brake cable taken from a vandalised child’s bicycle, had been tied about three feet off the floor and stretched for eight feet between a park bench and railings in Titchfield Common, Hampshire . Bradley Deacon from Leigh Park with his daughter Lilly  who was injured when she was cut by a sharp wire when out on her bike . 'Lilly went off on her bike laughing and giggling, but as she turned around a corner I could suddenly hear tears. 'I thought 'oh God, she's come off her bike' but no, to our horror, it was even worse. 'She had ridden into a brake cable that had been stretched across the path deliberately, in my view, with the intention to hurt someone. 'She'd got back up off the floor but was in a lot of pain and there's now a mark around her neck. Lilly's grandfather Colin Deacon at the spot where the wire was stretched across the path in Hampshire . The thin wire can be seen in this picture. Police would like to speak to two teenage boys who were in the park . 'I know youngsters like to play pranks but stringing up a wire cable you can't see is disgusting and dangerous. 'Lilly loves her bike and this was a terrible thing to do that could ruin a little girl's summer holiday and put her off cycling.' After tending to Lilly, Mr Deacon Snr, from Titchfield Common set about warning others using the path. He helped police remove the wire, which was about three feet off the floor and stretched for eight feet. Now he is urging the two teenagers he spoke to sitting near the scene to come forward to help police catch whoever strung the wire up. He said: 'We need anyone with any information to come forward so we can bring the culprits to justice. 'This was not a prank, it was a serious attempt to hurt someone for fun and that's unacceptable.' Hampshire Police are appealing for information about the incident, which took place between 4.10pm and 4.55pm on Thursday. PC Jim Heath wants to stop the 'dangerous' situation happening again and echoed Mr Deacon's plea. He said: 'I'm very keen to trace those responsible to ensure there is no repeat incident and make them aware of how dangerous this could've been.' Police want to speak to anyone in the park who may have seen someone fixing the cable in place or tampering with the abandoned child's BMX. They also believe two boys aged around 15 or 16 sitting in the play park at the time may hold 'vital information' and urged them to come forward.","Lilly Bailey-Deacon, 6,  'nearly decapitated' by wire strung across footpath .

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . An orphaned cheetah cub has discovered that a dog is more than a man's best friend at San Diego Zoo Safari Park. When Ruuxa the cheetah was abandoned by his mother, he was taken in by the zoo who found him a new friend to keep him company - Raina the Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy. The two animals, who are both nearly four months old, scamper around their enclosure like the best of friends in this footage which was released by the zoo. Ridgebacks are no stranger to big cats and are also known as African Lion Hounds because they were originally bred as farm and hunting dogs in Rhodesia - now Zimbabwe. Once they picked up the scent of a lion, they would track it down and try and confine it so a hunter with a gun could get a clean shot. But luckily for Ruuxa the cheetah, Raina has been introduced to help him navigate his new home in the zoo. Besties: Ruuxa the cheetah and Raina the Ridgeback go for a walk together in San Diego Zoo Safari Park . When cheetahs are born they are blind and completely rely on their mothers to protect them from predators. If the mother cannot produce enough milk, she will often abandon her cubs in the wild leaving them to the mercy of the outside world. So far Raina the Ridgeback has been showing the young cub some fun and games inside their enclosure and it looks like there is never a dull moment at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.","Ruuxa the cheetah was adopted by San Diego Safari Park .

"By . James  Nye . Battle: Imperial Highness Prince Sultan Ertugrul Osman V (who is now deceased) with his wife, Princess Zeyneb attend Ahmet Ertegun Memorial Service on March 2, 2007 in New York City . She is the widowed Afghan princess wife of the man known as the 'Last Ottoman Sultan' and is battling eviction from her $390 a month rent controlled Lexington Avenue, Manhattan apartment. Her Imperial Highness Zeynep Osman, 69, has been asked to vacate the two-story apartment she calls home in the $10.1 million Upper East Side building she has lived in since her marriage to Ertogroul Osman in 1991. Like her husband, who would have assumed the throne in Istanbul of the now-defunct Ottoman Empire as Sultan in 1994, Zeynep was expelled from her home in Afghanistan and is refusing to leave because she has 'become accustomed to a certain lifestyle'. After the . death of her husband in Istanbul, aged 97, in 2009, the three story . building she has lived in for more than 20-years south of 74th . Street was sold. Her . new landlord, Avi Dishi paid her a visit and according to Zeynep, the . first words he said to her about the home her husband had lived in for . 64-years were: 'I want you out. I paid too much for this building to . have you here.' So . began her three-year legal battle, a far cry from the 124-acre Yildiz . Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, that she would have lived in with her husband . had the Ottoman Empire not been overthrown by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in . 1923. Eviction: This is the three-story property on Lexington Avenue that was sold for $10.1 million in 2011 and is at the center of the rent-control fight between Princess Zeynep and Avi Dishi . Matters reached a head in January 2012, during a visit to a sick relative in Turkey, Dishi served her an eviction notice according to The New York Times. He claims that upon purchasing the property, which has a restaurant on the ground floor, he was given only one lease which dated from 1977 that has expired to become a month-to-month occupancy. Therefore, he claims he is well within his rights to ask the Afghan princess to leave the rent-controlled home. However, Zeynep's lawyer, who she retains at the cost of thousands of dollars a month discovered a crucial detail on the eviction notice. It was addressed to 'E. Osman and G. Osman', or more to the point, the would-be Sultan's first wife, Gulda, who passed away in 1985. 'You can’t evict a dead person,' Maddy Tarnofsky, Zeynep’s lawyer, said to The New York Times. However, a court decided to deny Tarnofsky's motion to dismiss the eviction notice and the case is now in limbo, with Princess Zeynep having to provide death and marriage certificates to prove her occupancy of the apartment with her husband since 1991. Modesty: Imperial Highness Prince Sultan Ertugrul Osman V with his wife, Princess Zeyneb attend the Ahmet Ertegun Memorial Service on March 2, 2007 in New York City . Speaking to The New York Times, Zeynep also complained about the state of disrepair that Dishi has let the apartment fall into. Under the prior landlord the number of violations in the two-story home stood at 72 and now have topped out at 201. New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has had to spend $49,000 fixing up the apartment since 2005, replacing banisters, fixing radiators and boilers. The city has billed Dishi for the repairs. Grandfather: Abdul Hamid II (1842-1918), last Sultan of Turkey, c1880. Called the Great Assassin, he was a despotic ruler who was deposed and exiled in 1909 . Dishi has purchased a neighboring property for $24.5 million and it is speculated he has plans to merge the two buildings. However, he cannot while Princess Zeynep is in residency, although Dishi has claimed in court papers that she has indicated to him that she would be willing to leave for a 'significant' amount. Indeed, speaking to The New York Times, Zeynep said that she was willing to cut a deal. 'It pains me to leave, but he must be reasonable,' she said. 'I am accustomed to a certain lifestyle, and he cannot just throw me out.' Married to Ertugrul Osman for 18 years, Zeynep's husband was the descendant of Osman I, who established the Ottoman empire that controlled parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. At its height in the 14th century it reached the gates of Vienna, Austria, but afterwards began a slow and steady decline. Osman was studying in that city when his grandfather was deposed as Sultan and the Turkish Republic was proclaimed in 1923. Known as His Imperial Highness Prince Ertugrul Osman, he moved into the Lexington Avenue apartment in 1947 and lived there till his death in 2009. Educated and able to speak French, German, English and of course Turkish fluently, Osman worked for a shipping company for most of his life. Oppulence lost: The dining room at the Yildiz Palace, Istanbul, circa 1890. The palace, was built in 1880 and used by Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II . He stayed out of Turkish politics and when interviewed in 2006 said that 'Democracy works well in Turkey.' Born in 1912, Osman was the last surviving grandson of an Ottoman Sultan and his grandfather, Abdul Hamid II, ruled from 1876 to 1909. He stayed away from Turkey for 52 years and on his return in August 1992, he went to see his grandfather's home at the 285-room Dolmabahce Palace. Instead of a private tour, he insisted on joining a public tour group. For more than 60-years Osman refused to travel on a Turkish passport, instead using a certificate that marked him as a citizen of the Ottoman Empire. This was discarded in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and increased airport security.","Her Imperial Highness Zeynep Osman, 69, has been living in her Lexington Avenue apartment on the Upper East Side since 1991 .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Two brave teenage pilots managed to land a plane that lost power mid-air without causing a single scratch on the plane or on their bodies. 18-year-old certified pilot Eric Nicholas and his pilot-in-training friend Tanner Price of Tulsa, Oklahoma, took off in a Cessina 172 from Riverside Airport and were doing a touch and go at Tulsa International Airport with the next stop being Owasso airport, reports Oklahoma's Own. Pilot Eric Nichols told reporters that the plane barely made it past the runway when the plane's speed indicator showing how fast it is going plummeted to zero. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brave: Hero teenage pilot Eric Nichols has only 61 hours of pilot training but he managed to make a perfect emergency landing when a plane ran out of power . Perfect landing: The plane landed just feet in front of a moving car . Proud friend: Tanner price is happy to be alive after watching his friend make the perfect emergency landing . Instead of panicking, the brave boys used their training to make the perfect emergency landing. 'It's amazing. I've never seen something like this before. Never been in it,' Price said. After their first day back at Jenks High School they flew the plane to Tulsa International and even touched the ground once. When they went to go back into the air they only made it 100 feet because the engine lost power. 'We had about 1,900 RPMs and I knew that wasn't going to be enough to get us anywhere, so we didn't have enough runway, I told tower, 'I'm putting it down,' and I set it down on the road here,' said Nichols. Nichols knew that landing would be risky because a car was driving down the road below them. Luckily it slowed to avoid the falling plane. Nichols masterfully set the plane between two utility poles and says he knew how because he's made narrow landing before. 'Uh, it was a tight fit. Definitely a tight fit,' Nichols said. Calm and Collected: Eric Nichols kept his calm and made a 30 second decision that saved their lives . Tulsa Fire Airport Chief, Michael Atchison, said he was impressed with the boys’ quick thinking in a life-threatening situation. 'Real proud of those guys,' Atchison said. 'They did a good job 'cause, you know, the tense moments right there, for them to lay it down, find a place to land it when they lost all the power. They did a great job.' Nichols only has 61 hours of training while Tanner has just 13. The company that owns the plane called Christensen Aviation confirmed that no one was injured. Oklahoma's Own pilot Will Cavanaugh said he was also impressed with the teens' flying chops. 'Very tight landing. For such young pilots to have this experience so young, and to walk away from this, only good things for them in the future,'Kavanagh said.","Eric Nicholas and his pilot-in-training friend Tanner price of Tulsa, Oklahoma made the perfect emergency landing in a Cessina 172 .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Somi Guha, 36, said she is proud for standing up to Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC in another of his infamous race rows . The actress who took a stand against Jeremy Clarkson after he made a racist joke during an episode of Top Gear said she is proud of her actions. Indian-born Somi Guha revealed how she was inundated with nasty comments from Top Gear fans after publicly criticising Clarkson's use of the word 'slope' - a derogatory word for those of Asian descent - in a Burma special. But today Ms Guha, from Tower Hamlets, east London, said she is glad she took a stand - and would happily do it again. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I'm glad I did what I did - and if I hear Jeremy Clarkson make any more racist comments on TV I won't hesitate to do the same thing.' Ms Guha admits she was not prepared for the backlash she would face after tackling the BBC under equality laws. After being offended by the use of the word, which was aired in March this year, Ms Guha sought advice from Equality Justice, which previously worked on allegations of racism surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother. Her lawyers sent a formal complaint to the head of the BBC Trust Lord Patten. But the actress - who was in 2006 sci-fi movie Children of Men and has also appeared in hit ITV show The Bill - told the paper how Twitter trolls created fake accounts under her name, which were then targeted by Clarkson fans. She said: 'It shows what can happen when you stand up to someone bigger and more powerful than you.' She added: 'The Top Gear presenters seem determined to make racist comments.' The row broke out after the three hosts - Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson - were tasked with building a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand during the series finale. After completion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards him on a makeshift bridge. Investigation: The BBc has launched a probe into Top Gear after a string of controversies. The show's presenters built a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand during a series finale and Clarkson commented that there was a 'slope' on it - just as a man of Asian descent walked towards them . The three hosts, pictured during the Burma special. Equal Justice, the lawyers representing the actress, said it was 'fantastic' that Ms Guha had made a stand . Co-presenter Richard Hammond, 44, replied: 'You're right, it's definitely higher on that side.' In her formal written complaint to the BBC, she says: 'Casual racism in the media by established BBC stalwarts is constantly brushed aside. 'Discrimination within the industry is accepted. Racial profiling of roles is accepted and expected. 'I find it offensive that Jeremy Clarkson refers to people of different races in pejorative terms. What is that saying to children who watch him? - that it's OK to bully and make racist comments. 'Jeremy Clarkson has made derogatory comments about Mexicans. Now he bullies an Asian person. It has to stop.' Last week, Ofcom ruled the BBC was in breach of its code for airing the controversial episode. Last week, Ofcom ruled that the BBC had failed to check whether the scripted word said by Clarkson would offend viewers . An Ofcom spokesman said the broadcaster had included an 'offensive racial term' which was 'not justified by context'. It said: 'Jeremy Clarkson used the word 'slope' to refer both to an Asian man crossing a bridge, and the incline of the bridge. 'This was scripted in advance. The BBC failed to take the opportunity, either during filming or post-production, to check whether the word had the potential to offend viewers.' In its representations to Ofcom, the BBC said programme makers were aware the word was 'used to refer to people of Asian origin' but they considered 'such use was mere slang'. It added they were not aware it had the potential to cause offence outside the UK and would not have used it, had they been aware. Following the Ofcom ruling, the BBC said: 'We dealt with this matter some time ago, the programme apologised at the time and explained the context, and we are now focusing on delivering another series of one of Britain's best loved shows.' Lawrence Davies, from Equal Justice, said it was fantastic that Ms Guha had found the strength to fight against the comment. Just weeks after the furore, Clarkson was forced to deny allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series. In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. After the footage emerged, calls were . made for Clarkson to be sacked. He initially denied the claim but later . issued an apology. That was not the first - or last time - that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments. Weeks later, in unaired footage of the series, the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. It took place during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount. Clarkson became embroiled in a second race row, just weeks after the 'slope' controversy . Telling viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting rhyme. After initially denying the claims, Clarkson 'begged' for forgiveness, saying he 'did everything in [his] power to not use that word', but that his 'efforts weren't quite good enough.' Jeremy Clarkson was also accused of racism for naming his black West Highland terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba, who is from the Ivory Coast. Clarkson, who often mocks political correctness, asked: ‘Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’ In December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families'. Weeks later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'. In his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the ‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains.","Somi Guha, 36, made formal complaint to BBC over Clarkson's racist jibe .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A pregnant police officer from Florence, Kentucky, has been told she has to stay on patrol during her pregnancy - or take unpaid leave and lose her health benefits. Lyndi Trischler, who became a Florence Police officer in 2012, last year gave birth to a daughter and was given office work so she could cope with the phyiscal strains. However, for this pregnancy the department says they are unable to move her position because of a change in the rules so she'll have to stay on patrol or take the time as unpaid leave . If Trischler stays on unpaid leave, by the time she gives birth to her son she will no longer have medical insurance which is a problem because her son suffers from a rare bone disorder, reports WFSB. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Difficult choice: Lyndi Trischler was told she had to make a choice between staying on patrol or taking unpaid leave . Mother: Trischler already has one daughter and she is looking forward to giving birth to her son . Loves her job: Trischler, pictured here with a relative, loves being a police officer and even has a master's degree in criminal justice . 'I was told that I would need to use all the time that I had saved, vacation and sick time. Once that time was all used up, I would need to go on unpaid leave,' said Trischler. 'The time I had saved would be about six weeks I think and from the time I needed to come off the road I wouldn't have made it even close to my delivery so I wouldn't have health insurance by the time I delivered so that was really scary,' she continued. Trischler, who has a master’s degree in criminal justice, says she is doing her best to work while pregnant but says the weight of the gun is pulling at her stomach and her bullet proof vest no longer fit. The young mom has now filed a complaint against the city of Florence alleging discrimination. “I worked very hard to get to this point. This is the career I’ve really wanted. I just want to get back to work,” she told Today. Forced to choose: Trischler doesn't want to have to choose between being a mother and having a paycheck . 'No one should have to choose between their health and having a family and their paycheck,' said Elizabeth Gedmark, staff attorney for the advocacy group A Better Balance. The city's attorney Hugh O. Skees issued a statement outlining their side of the story saying, 'The city has reviewed the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) complaint filed by officer Trischler. The city does not agree with the allegations of the complaint, but respects the rights of the officer to bring this proceeding before the EEOC.  The city will follow the process in that form and present its defence.' 'I don't think the department would have handled it this way. I think they were just given a policy from the city and I don't think my department had any choice,' said Trischler.

Vanessa Fowler said her nieces - now aged 13, 10 and 7 - are seeing a counsellor and rebuilding their lives without either of their parents, as she spoke to The Sunday Mail for the first time since Gerard Baden-Clay was found guilty of murdering his wife last month. Ms Fowler said their mother would be proudly looking down on all three girls as they are settling into their new school, making friends and doing ‘what normal kids do’. The eldest child takes after her mother by excelling in ballet and the middle daughter is in a leadership role in her class, while the youngest is flourishing at primary school. Scroll down for video . The eldest child takes after her mother by excelling in ballet and the middle daughter is in a leadership role in her class while the youngest is flourishing at primary school . Allison Baden-Clay's sister Vanessa Fowler (far left) said her sister would be looking down proudly on her three daughters . 'They are doing things that Allison would be looking down on them — she’s proud,' Ms Fowler said. She added that as the past could not be changed the family can only provide a nurturing environment for the girls just as their mother had done in their young lives. ‘They talk about her, they are working with their counsellor so hopefully in the long run they will be able to know the situation.’ ‘I don’t think they really comprehend it at the moment,' she said. ‘We’re guided by the counsellor and he deals with a lot of their questions and that’s all confidential between them.’ Former real estate agent, Baden-Clay, 43, denied murdering his wife, Allison, 43, who he had reported missing on April 20, 2012. Her body was found dumped in a creek 10 days later and Baden-Clay always maintained she was attacked or fell while out for a walk. During his trial at the Brisbane Supreme Court, the jury heard about Baden-Clay's numerous affairs and financial worries - enough of a motive for murder. The jury found him guilty of the cold-blooded killing and a judge sentenced him to life behind bars. ‘We were pleased with the outcome but it’s not going to bring Allison back. At least we have some justice,’ she said. Ms Fowler said the three girls could not yet comprehend the tragic situation but would learn to over time . Ms Fowler spoke about Allison’s parents Geoff and Priscilla Dickie taking on the role as the primary carers for their grandchildren and that the couple wouldn’t have it any other way. ‘The girls come first. They will do anything and everything for the three girls.’ She also mentioned that they still have contact with their other grandparents. Ms Fowler described her sister as generous and caring with everyone she met which has been instilled in her children. 'She put herself last and put everybody else first. She did everything she could for anybody else.’ She admitted the family still had a long journey ahead of them which included fulfilling her sister’s desire to give her daughters the best education possible. ‘She will think they are on track right now,’ she said. ‘She will think they are prospering, doing so well. I think she would be really pleased.’ Ms Fowler said the children had a long road ahead of them without either of their parents (pictured) but the family will remain by their side for constant loving support .","Allison Baden-Clay’s sister speaks out for first time since her murder trial .

Local guys, known as Dom and Adrian, who actually call themselves - The Bondi Hipsters - have released their own version of the original ad called ‘Mom Song’ which is a parody on a mother's apparent struggle when her son changes from a boy to a man. ’Man Song’, which was released on Thursday by the guys who regularly create parodies about stereoptypical Bondi types, is an amusing song about a son breaking the news to his mother that he is moving out of the nest egg and into a Bondi apartment with his mate. Dom takes Adrian along for moral support and together they let his mother down ‘gently’ by telling her that he is a ‘mahn’ now because Old Spice has made his beard grow quicker, his chest hair thicker and his triceps bigger. Scroll down for video . Dom is a 'mahn' now because Old Spice has made his beard grow quicker, his chest hair thicker and his triceps bigger . It's time to move out when you can make your own lunches and tie your own knots . A quick headbanging session ensued after they declare 'I've even got my own Medicare card' and he's had to 'use it twice because we party so hard' ‘Yar hes an independent self-sufficient mahn,’  Adrian croons to Dom's mum while tinkering on the piano in the lounge room. The guys explain that he is ready for manhood now that he can pack his own lunch and tie his own knots – not to mention that he’s ‘got a cool leather wallet and Swiss made watch’. A quick headbanging session ensues after they declare 'I've even got my own Medicare card'and he's had to 'use it twice because we party so hard.' Adrian then announces to Dom's mother while knocking over a photo frame of the two of them: . 'Sorry but Dom doesn’t need you anymore. He's moving in with me so sorry about that dot com,' as they start to pack up his belongings. 'Yar hes an independent self-sufficient mahn,' Adrian says to Dom's mum while tinkering on the piano in their  lounge room . He doesn't need to live with his mother now thanks to Old Spice providing him with manliness . But don't worry mum - 'you will still see my face because I'm turning my old room into a storage space' Dom also makes worthy note of Ashley -  the love of his life who he met when they 'both swiped right' - referring to online dating site Tinder. And just in case his mother wasn't sure where all of his manliness had come from - they give her a quick run-down. But Adrian comforted his mum with the fact that 'you will still see my face because I'm turning my old room into a storage space'. As the guys were carrying his stuff out of the door the son ends their cheery tune with 'can you lend me some money, can you help me find my keys and give us a lift to Bondi please?' Needless to say, they were last seen juggling all of the belonging on their bicycles. 'Sorry but Dom doesn't need you anymore. He's moving in with me so sorry about that dot com' 'Can you lend me some money, can you help me find my keys and give us a lift to Bondi please?' Needless to say the very poker-faced mother sends them off on their bikes .","Sydney comedy act do their hilarious take on latest Old Spice commercial .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s infamous big soda ban push appeared to have fizzled out until a new supporter emerged this week – current Mayor Bill de Blasio. The new administration announced this week it is continuing the city’s appeal of the so-called ‘Big Gulp Ban’ being overturned last year. A successful appeal would lead to all sugary drinks – soda, juice and even some coffee drinks – being banned from sale in the city. Not lovin' it: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to fight to enact former mayor Michael Bloomberg's big soda ban . It has been referred to by many as the ‘Big Gulp Ban,’ but it ironically does not affect the sale of sodas in places without health department grades. Convenience stores such as 7-Eleven are not subject to health department inspections. Sugary coffee drinks served by the likes of Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks would also be affected.City lawyers will appear at a Court of Appeals hearing June 4 to argue their position, the New York Daily News first reported. Mayor de Blasio has said in the past that he supports the idea of limiting the size of sodas in an effort to help combat diabetes and obesity. A coalition of hospitals and minority advocacy groups also filed a brief in support of the city’s position, according to Capital New York. ‘The problem it addresses is perhaps the gravest and most pervasive public health issue of our time,’ said the filing. The devil is in the details: The rule ironically does not affect soda sold in convenience stores despite being derisively called the 'Big Gulp Ban' by many . City Health Commissioner Mary Bassett echoed those words in an interview with CNY. ‘The fact is that we have this terrible epidemic underway and we have a responsibility in public health, all of us including the industry, to tackle this epidemic,’ she said. ‘If people drank 16 ounces rather than 20 ounces of soda, we’d be able to clock millions of pounds in weight reduction.’ Hizzoner also said that going the legislative route would be more preferable than a Health Department resolution such as the very one he is fighting to enact, the Daily News noted. ‘I think we could do a much better job of working with parents and working with communities to help them understand why this is a good idea and get their buy-in,’ said the mayor earlier this year. The mayor appears to be failing on that front, as a recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that 57 per cent of New Yorkers opposed the ban and only 37 per cent supported it. The ban was first struck down in March 2013 after an appeals court judge ruled then-Mayor Bloomberg overstepped his boundaries. That ruling was then upheld in a later appeal.","The ban first proposed by former mayor Michael Bloomberg was struck down in March 2013 by an appeals court .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . Waiting in long checkout queues after discovering your favourite items are sold out while dodging screaming kids and trolleys blocking the aisles is most customers' idea of the supermarket trip from hell. A national survey reveals that most people can’t get in and out of supermarkets quick enough as being stuck in never-ending checkout queues has come in as the number one pet peeve for 62 per cent of Australians. More than half of the 2,500 consumers loathed discovering the items they wanted were out of stock and also showed their loyalty to labels with 35 per cent not impressed when their desired brands are replaced by the supermarket’s line. While parents who have no control over their unruly children and self service machine errors equally irritated 38 per cent of shoppers and trolleys blocking the aisles was almost as annoying for 36 per cent. Waiting in never-ending checkout queues has come in as the number one pet peeve for 62 per cent of Australians when shopping at supermarkets . Parents who have no control over their unruly children was another massive bug bear for customers . Trolleys blocking the aisles was also annoying for 36 per cent of people surveyed . Another common obstacle when attempting a seamless shopping experience was navigating the car park to find a spot which was a killer for 28 per cent of respondents - while searching for the ever elusive staff member for assistance was also not so much fun for 28 per cent of customers. But on the other hand, a talkative check assistant was a tad painful for 11 per cent of Australians. The fact that alcohol wasn’t available in supermarkets was not a massive bug bear with only eight per cent of people finding it inconvenient. However, eight per cent of people admitted to having stolen something from a supermarket such as walking out without paying or not scanning something at the self-checkout. Canstar Blue conducted the survey and spokesman Simon Downes said the frustrations expressed by shoppers was perfectly understandable. 'A supermarket selling out of an item you want is probably going to annoy you even more if you’ve just struggled to find a parking space and then had to fight your way through a packed aisle full of screaming kids just to find out,' he said. 'If you’ve had a particularly frustrating experience doing your shopping, the last thing you need is 10 minutes queuing up time to dwell on it.' More than half of the 2,500 consumers loathed discovering the items they wanted were out of stock . Not being able to find a car park before the shopping had even begun was a killer for 28 per cent of customers . Mr Downes said a swift shopping trip was important for time-poor customers. 'You might find that by the time you do get to pay, the last thing you want to do is engage in small talk with the person scanning your items,' he said. 'Or if you’ve decided to take the self-service option and keep being told to take unexpected items out of the bagging area, you’ll probably feel like you can’t get home quick enough.' Meanwhile on a grassroots level, an overwhelming 74 per cent saw the importance of buying locally produced food. As many as 68 per cent of the surveyors saw no problem with eating products a day or two past the used by date and 65 per cent believed their supermarket was the best value for money. While 53 per cent declared their loyalty to their store despite 46 per cent believing they could get groceries cheaper elsewhere but preferred the convenience of the one they knew best. The consumers proved they weren't major suckers for advertising with only 13 per cent admitting to being influenced by an ad on TV and deciding to swap supermarkets as a result, while as few as eight per cent care which supermarket a celebrity chef has signed with. Customers showed their loyalty to labels with 35 per cent not impressed when their desired brands are replaced by the supermarket's line .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . Dr Khalid Qidwai and Shahnaz Qidwai . A cash-strapped tradesman charged over the murder of a Sydney woman begged the victim's  husband for money two months before the violent bashing in a multi-million dollar waterfront home, a court has heard. The daughter of Shahnaz Qidwai, who was found bludgeoned to death the day after a feud between Dr Khalid Qidwai and Tony Halloun, said her mother never trusted the man they hired to concrete their driveway at their home in Henley, Sydney. Maha Qidwai told the NSW Supreme Court on Thursday that her mother had mentioned several times that she didn’t find him 'very trustworthy', Channel Nine reported. Maha, 28, sobbed as she told the court that she had not been back to the family home since  discovering her mother's body on that fatal day on June 15, 2012. The day before Mrs Qidwai was found dead, Halloun went to her husband's medical surgery in Croydon and asked for $3,500 but Dr Qidwai refused to pay before the job was done. This response allegedly prompted Halloun to use the chilling words ‘I'll win in the end’. Scroll down for video . Maha Qidwai sobbed as she told the court that she had not been back to the family home since discovering her mother's body on that fatal day on June 15, 2012 . 'I'll win in the end' are the chilling words of Tony Halloun (pictured) believed to have been said to Dr Khalid Qidwai the day before he allegedly murdered the doctor's wife in their Sydney home . The following day Dr Qidwai's wife, Shahnaz Qidwai, 65, was found bashed to death in their multi-million dollar waterfront home in Henley, northwest Sydney . Halloun, who was hired to concrete the Qidwai's driveway (pictured), went to Dr Qidwai's surgery and asked him for $3,500 but he refused to pay before the job was done which prompted Halloun's threatening words . Maha, the couple's youngest daughter, said she had heard Halloun begging for money from her father two months before her mother was killed. 'Please, whatever you can give me, doctor,' she recalled Halloun saying in a 'softer voice than normal.' 'Dad then came in and asked my mum for $200 and he walked outside with the intention to give it to Tony.' A month before the conversation, Maha was interrupted by a 'relatively loud' discussion between her father and Halloun, which lasted about half an hour, the court heard. 'That was a conversation about the quoting of the job,' she said. Maha said Halloun had also spoken to her about being thousands of dollars in debt. Halloun's barrister Peter Lange asked if Maha would do 'whatever it takes to secure conviction?' 'I think it would be yes for anyone in my situation,' she replied. Maha Qidwai (pictured leavng the court on Thursday) said her mother didn't trust Halloun . Halloun, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder, had arrived at the home in Henley - a little known but wealthy suburb in northwest Sydney - at about 7.40 that morning then Dr Qidwai left to go to his surgery about 9am. Halloun is alleged to have told police that three armed intruders stormed into the house telling him ‘don't worry, we are not here for you’ and then he said the men ordered him to ‘get her’. So Halloun then grabbed Mrs Qidwai by the hair and dragged her, ‘kicking and screaming’. The last time he saw her, Halloun said she had tears streaming down her face and a gun to her head. ‘She was in fear for her life,’  he said. Halloun said he then went to his car, smoked a cigarette and waited to see if the men came out, then about 40 minutes later he left the property. Maha said she had heard Halloun begging her father Dr Khalid Qidwai (pictured outside the court) for money two months before her mother was killed . On the opening day of his trial on Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard the labourer contacted police a year after he was charged with the crime and said he had ‘more information’ about that fatal day on June 15, 2012. It was one of three inconsistent versions of events that the financially-stressed Halloun gave after Mrs Qidwai was bashed to death inside her home, crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau told the jury on Tuesday. When Maha came home from work at 2pm, she found her mother on the floor near her bed with her face and mouth covered in blood and bruises - she was cold to touch. Halloun had left more than two hours earlier. Crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau  (pictured) said Halloun took $3,400 from the home which Mrs Qidwai was organising the money to pay her husband's staff around the time of the attack . Mr Tabuteau said Halloun fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence . At the time of Mrs Qidwai's death, the court heard she had been organising the money to pay her husband's staff and had about $3,400 in envelopes in the home. 'The crown case is that the money was taken at the time of or moments after the attack on Mrs Qidwai and that it was the accused who took that money,' Mr Tabuteau said. The crown says Halloun's business was $97,000 in debt. After police questioned him about the murder, Mr Tabuteau said he fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence. But Mr Lange questioned that Halloun's financial difficulties provided a motive. 'What does common sense tell you about a robbery worth $2000 to $4000? ... is that a motive to kill the wife of your employer?' he said. The trial continues.","Tony Halloun was hired to concrete Dr Khalid Qidwai’s driveway .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . The threat was made at the Booralie Early Learning Centre in Terrey Hills . Parents have been sent into a mad panic about whether to send their children to a Sydney preschool this morning after a letter was found yesterday threatening that a bomb was allegedly in a child's school bag. Police confirmed there was a 'threatening note' discovered in the kitchen at the Booralie Early Learning Centre in Terrey Hills on Sydney’s Northern Beaches at 9.30am on Wednesday. The preschool was evacuated for a short period of time along with a neighbouring preschool on Booralie Road before police cleared the scene. A staff member for the two preschools said on Thursday morning nobody was available for comment on the incident. The alarming news was announced on the Northern Beaches Mums Facebook page alerting other mothers of the threat and asking if parents would send their children back. However, the popular local mums online forum posted that the letter had actually been found on the director's desk. The Booralie Early Learning Centre in Terrey Hills shares a site with the Terrey Hills Little School and the Sydney Japanese International School on Booralie Road . The bomb threat sparked a lively discussion the Northern Beaches Mums Facebook page . ‘Police have done all the appropriate checks and given the all clear and the daycare handled the matter professionally, however I’m still feeling nervous. Has anyone ever heard of a bomb threat at a preschool?’ the post said. Then another post followed claiming the letter was in fact left on the director’s desk and ‘apparently it said there was a bomb in a child’s school bag.’ Mothers expressed their concern on the local mums Facebook page about sending their children back to the preschool following the incident. ‘I don’t think I could send my child back there just in case as I would never forgive myself is (sic) something happened,’ one said. Another mother asked to be personally messaged with more information as she was concerned about the news - especially considering her son was scheduled to attend the preschool this morning. While other mothers simply dismissed the note as a cruel hoax. ‘Really how people can make a threat like that is beyond me. We have no problem sending our son back. But you’re right to feel nervous,’ one mum posted. Another urged parents not to give the 'scumbags the satisfaction' of not sending their children. A mother, who is a director of another preschool, tried to reassure her fellow local mums that it was more than likely a disgruntled parent or staff member. ‘We have procedures, policies and training with my organisation in this area and bomb threats in the early childhood field are more often than not made by disgruntled parent or staff member and highly unlikely to be serious – definitely send them.’ Police appeal for anyone with information to come forward. A spokesperson said the site was cleared by specialist officers after the preschools were closed temporarily.","Booralie Early Learning Centre in Terrey Hills received a bomb threat via a letter found in the kitchen .

"By . James  Nye . The ice cream truck jingle is the sound of innocent childhood summers and also the melody to the most racist song in the history of the United States. Still to this day the familiar tune is responsible for setting off frenzied excitement among children across the country. Popularly known as the 19th century standard 'Turkey in the Straw', the song in fact owes its roots to minstrel song's including the offensively titled, 'N***** Love a Watermelon Ha! Ha! Ha!' Racist history: The jingle played by most ice cream trucks is historically based on one of the most racist songs in the history on the United States . That song was directly spawned from another composition often performed in blackface called 'Zip C***' - which in turn lent its lyrics, but not the tune to the Oscar winning popular song, 'Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.' The reason why a racist song has come to be so closely, albeit surreptitiously linked with ice cream trucks dates back to 19th century ice cream parlors. Minstrel songs were the most popular form of entertainment at the time and therefore were played in these parlors, so when ice cream trucks appeared after World War Two, the same songs people associated were played. An investigation by NPR discovered that the ice cream truck jingle, played by most, is directly linked to a song that was released in March 1916 by Columbia Records, it was written by actor Harry C. Browne and deeply rooted in racial ignorance. Using a music hall call-and-response technique, Browne's lyrics were set to the melody of Turkey in the Straw, which is turn dates back to an even older British song, 'The Old Rose Tree.' Browne: 'You n*****s quit throwin' them bones and come down and get your ice cream!"" Black men: (incredulously): 'Ice Cream?!?' Browne: 'Yes, ice cream! Colored man's ice cream: Watermelon!' The original song was brought to American shores by Scottish and Irish immigrants who settled along the Appalachian Trail. Offensive: The Zip C*** was a blackface character who parodied a free black man attempting to conform to white high society . In the 1802s, the tune had its lyrics changed again for the 'Zip C***' song that was to be performed by a blackface character bearing the same name. He was meant to parody a black man attempting to conform to white society and became the counterpart to the dimwitted character living in the south known as Jim Crow. The two characters would interact in varying degrees of ignorant stereotypical styles of speech and song. Indeed, for Theodore R. Johnson, III, the author of NPR's report, his new found knowledge troubles him. 'I can live with this, but what's to be done on the summer day when my children's eyes light up at the far-off sound of the familiar melody, and they dash in a frenzy toward me for change?' said Johnson. 'Do I empower them with the history of our country, or encourage the youthful exuberance induced by the ice cream truck? Is it my responsibility to foul the sweet taste of ice cream with their first taste of racism?' Video courtesy Kyler Gillespie .","Widely used ice cream truck jingle is based upon bigoted song which mocks African Americans .
The song is popularly known as 'Turkey in the Straw'
However, this based on minstrel song that is entitled, 'N***** Love a Watermelon, Ha! Ha! Ha!"

The . private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in . recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering . abdicating since his 75th birthday in January last year. ‘He . saw, above all, that his son was in his prime and didn’t want to see . him like Prince Charles who will be 66 years old in November,’ Mr . Spottorno told Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo. Waiting: The King told courtiers he decided to abdicate because he did not want his son to 'grow old waiting for the throne like Prince Charles', it was claimed yesterday. Above, the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla . (Left to right) King Juan Carlos of Spain at his last military parade, with Queen Sofia, Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia . However, last week, a source at the royal palace in Madrid claimed King Juan Carlos was abdicating for  political reasons. The . monarch’s popularity has nosedived amid accusations of being out of . touch as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory. In . 2012, he was widely criticised for going on a secret hunting trip to . Botswana to shoot elephants. The lavish holiday contrasted with the news . at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless. Prince . Charles has been waiting for 62 years and four months – longer  than . any other heir apparent in British history – to take the throne. He . became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother, then Princess . Elizabeth, who is now 88, acceded  in 1952. Crown Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia attend the Spain's National Armed Forces Day reception at the Royal Palace in Madrid . Spain's King Juan Carlos said on June 2 he would abdicate in favour of his son Prince Felipe, aiming to revive the scandal-hit monarchy at a time of economic hardship and growing discontent with the wider political elite . He broke the previous record for an heir in waiting, set by his great-great-grandfather, Edward VII, in 2011. King . Juan Carlos was held in high esteem during most of his reign for his . role in helping steer Spain from military dictatorship to democracy. Yesterday he presided over his last military parade before his son becomes King Felipe VI on June 19. The majority of Spaniards want a  referendum on the future of the monarchy, according to a poll published today, less than a week after King Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of his son .

"By . Ruth Styles . He might be a keen diver in his own right but even usually relaxed Prince Charles looked nervous when confronted with a giant lobster during a visit to Cornwall today. As one of the local fisherman swung round, his catch in his hands, the prince gamely stepped up to inspect the crustacean, which had been pulled out of a lobster pot just ahead of the royal visit. The prince met the men in his role as a supporter of The Fishermen's Mission and of Fishing for the Future; an initiative aimed at encouraging young people to choose fishing as a career. Scroll down for video . That's huge! Prince Charles comes face to face with a supersized crustacean in the Cornish village of Looe . Touring the fish market in the pretty town of Looe, Prince Charles also met some of the alumni from the Get into Fishing scheme run by the Prince's Trust, one of whom had a sizeable seabass to show the royal visitor. Like other Prince's Trust initiatives,  Get Into Fishing focuses on giving local . unemployed young people the skills, qualifications and training they . needed to get into the fishing industry. Among recent graduates is the crack lobster catcher, who along with a friend runs a stall on . Looe’s fish market, while another alumnus works on a trawler out of Plymouth . harbour. Later, Prince Charles was joined by the Duchess of Cornwall who had spent the morning touring the shops in Looe, among them a fishmonger and a grocer specialising in local produce. Success: Prince Charles met graduates of the Prince's Trust's Get into Fishing scheme for unemployed youths . Tasty! The Duchess of Cornwall had a foodie experience of her own and toured local shops and met producers . Like her husband, Camilla found herself on the receiving end of some animal attention, although in her case, it came in the shape of a pair of cuddly corgis. Much to their owner's delight, the animal-loving Duchess bent down to give the excited dogs a pat before rejoining her husband for a visit to the local RNLI station. There, the royal couple were shown around the purpose-built facility, which opened in 2003 and houses two lifeboats, before being whisked off to tour the local market. Clotted cream fudge, Cornish pasties and a sliver of local cheddar were all on the menu as Charles and Camilla made their way past stallholders, all eager to give the royal visitors a taste of Cornwall. Camilla, who was elegant in a butterfly print cream dress and matching jacket, even found time to tuck into another Cornish classic - a scone topped with clotted cream and jam. But whether or not the enormous lobster will also be making an appearance on the royal supper table remains to be seen.

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . A schoolboy has been found dead by his grandfather months after his mother died of cancer. The family of William Smith, 14, is in shock after he died at home in Immingham, Lincolnshire, on Saturday, August 9 and believe it was a prank gone wrong. His death came five months after his mother Alison Overton, 39, lost her battle with leukaemia. His grief-stricken father believes his son's death is a 'freak accident' and he was playing a joke on his grandmother. Double tragedy: Schoolboy William Smith, 14, has been found dead months after his mother . Alison Overton lost her battle with cancer . Paramedics from East Midlands Ambulance Service rushed the teenager to Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital, Grimsby, but he could not be revived. A post mortem examination was carried out at a hospital in Sheffield and it revealed he died from hanging. Grimsby and North Lincolnshire coroner Paul Kelly has opened and adjourned his inquest. His father Dean said that he believed William did not mean to hang himself and that it was a 'tragic accident'. William's grandfather had gone to check on his grandson when he discovered him. He said: 'I think it was a silly prank. He said the way he was it looked like a freak accident. In shock: William's family believe that his death was a tragic accident . 'He was making plans and he was looking forward to Christmas. In my heart he did not mean to do what he did.' He added there were no notes left by his son at the family home, where he also lived with his two brothers Samuel and Alfie. 'He would have let me know if that had been on his mind. I am not ashamed of him. I love him,' he said. 'I know he did not leave me that way. I just want people to know that I believe it was an accident and he didn't take his own life.' His mother Alison Overton died in hospital in Leeds in March after an 18-month battle with leukaemia. William was among relatives who followed her funeral cortege, led by a horse-drawn carriage. Dean, William, Samuel and Alfie wore button holes, as the couple had been due to get married in the church where the funeral service took place. Dean wrote on a memorial page: 'My lovely boy, forever in my heart, my soul, my life. No words can say how much I will miss you son. 'You are my first child, my miracle boy. I loved you from the first time you opened your eyes and always will. Sleep well son and keep my love with you as I always will. Yours love, your dad. 'Look after him now Ali you have your miracle with you again.' The heartbroken father said he had attended the release of sky lanterns at Roval Drive park last week when hundreds of people paid tribute to the 'amazing and brilliant' Oasis Academy Immingham schoolboy. He said: 'He has made me so proud that in his terrible passing he has brought a whole community together in love and respect.' He told how he had visited the hospital where the post mortem was carried out and sat talking to his son about the many tributes to him. Dean said: 'He looked as if he was fast asleep and I talked and talked.' Relatives are now planning a funeral at the same church where a service was held five months ago for William's mum - Trinity Methodist Church, in Pelham Road, Immingham. His son, a keen Liverpool supporter will be carried in a red coffin. He said: 'We will all be wearing Liverpool strips. I know he will be looking down on me laughing because I am a massive Wolves fan and would never wear a Liverpool strip. But I am doing it for him.' William's family have asked people to make donations towards Sheffield Children's Hospital. They asked mourners to wear football strips or bright colours to the funeral next Wednesday.","William Smith, 14, found five months after mother Alison Overton, 39, died .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . A magnitude 4.4 earthquake rolled through Southern California around dawn on Monday, giving people across Los Angeles a rude awakening. Seismologists orginally put the temblor at an estimated 4.7 after it struck at 6:25am. It was soon downgraded, but the shakeup was enough to give the City of Angels aggravating start to their work week. Scroll down for video... 'We're having an earthquake!': The 4.4 quake hit as just KTLA aired its morning news. Here, anchors realize what's happening just in time to dive under their desk . As it happens: Anchors Megan Henderson and Chris Schauble took cover under their desk on air as the quake hit during morning news . Startling: The quake was clearly felt quite strongly in the Hollywood KTLA studios, but no damage was reported . The quake was centered 15 miles west-northwest of the downtown civic center and occurred at a depth of about 5 miles. 'It felt like a bomb going off underneath our house,' said George McQuade, a West Hills resident. 'Nothing was damaged, but it sure woke everyone up. It was an eye-opener.' A live KTLA feed posted by YouTube user KTLA KING shows morning news anchors taking cover just as the quake struck. 'We're having an earthquake!' exclaims anchor Chris Schauble as he and co-anchor Megan Henderson dive under their desk. It was over almost as quickly as it had begun, but a quick cut to a KTLA correspondent in the field a few miles away revealed he'd felt it, too. 'It was a definite jolt, just one single jolt and I haven't seen the magnitude,' said Eric Spillman. 'But it definitely something we could feel here in downtown,' Exactly what they're supposed to do: When experiencing an earthquake while indoors, experts recommend you get under a desk or table if at all possible. If there is no available desk or table, you should stand against an interior wall . Still rolling: The earth shook for several moments as cameras rolled in the KTLA studio .

'It's not . that large by California terms. It's the size of earthquake we have . across the state once every couple of months,' Jones said. 'But we . haven't had one like this in LA for quite a while.' A magnitude 4.7 quake struck near Inglewood in 2009, she said. Did you feel it?

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai . Follow @@riathalsam . Poor Leeds. They left their coach to boos from the Millwall fans and exited the pitch to laughter and waves from the same supporters. In between, they could probably count themselves lucky to have lost the match by only two goals, scored by Mark Beevers and Shaun Williams. Make no mistake, Dave Hockaday's side were extremely disappointing in their first competitive fixture under the new manager. Barring the chance fluffed by Noel Hunt early in the second half they offered next to nothing, the only consolation being that their play after the break was better than that which went before. Opener: Millwall's Mark Beevers (left) celebrates with Nadjim Abdou (right) after scoring the first goal . Top dogs: Leeds manager Dave Hockaday (left) chats club owner Massimo Cellino (right) Millwall (4-2-3-1): Forde; Edwards, Dunne, Beevers, Malone; Abdou, Williams; Martin 7 (Gueye 67) McDonald, Woolford (Easter 67); Fuller (Gregory 81). Subs not used: Bywater, Webster, Briggs, Wright. Leeds (4-3-3): Silvestri; Byram, Wootton, Pearce, Warnock; Murphy, Austin, Tonge; Ajose (Poleon 79), Doukara (Cook 64), Hunt (Smith 58). Subs not used: Taylor, Killock, Berardi, Benedicic . Ref: Oliver Langford . Att: 16,205 . MOM: Mark Beevers . Had Hunt scored, they might have taken a draw or gone on to better, which really would have been an insult to Millwall, who flirted so intensely with relegation to League One last season but looked a cut above Leeds. Within nine minutes, Beevers had put Ian Holloway's side ahead. And moments later he probably should have doubled the advantage. In the first instance, Lee Martin, impressive throughout, found space down the right and whipped over a cross. It was a low delivery that Mark Beevers met with a volley to the right of Marco Silvestre. A goal up and it soon should have been two. Ironically, the chance that fell to Millwall's centre-half after 17 minutes was probably easier. A corner came over from the right and Beevers out-jumped – perhaps out-muscled – Scott Wootton at the far post. Silvestre was nowhere close but Beever's header missed the target. Alan Dunne had an even better chance in first-half stoppage time, but was unable to direct his free header away from Silvestre. That he had so much time and space said plenty about Leeds. They looked disjointed. A lack of cutting edge is one thing, and quite expected when a player like Ross McCormack is sold, regardless of the grand fee. But they also lacked fluency in all areas of the pitch. Hockaday, despite the modesty of his management CV, was known for stylish football at Forest Green. There was none of that at The Den; indeed it was hard to recall a reasonable opportunity in the first half. Arm in arm: Leeds United's Nicky Ajose (left) and Millwall's Scott McDonald battle for the ball . Millwall, on the other hand, played with spirit. Maybe that's a Holloway thing. He has set up a players' committee to let them have a whinge when necessary, so long as they balance their grievances with positive thoughts. The atmosphere at this club last season was, according to those involved, poor. They turned their season around by virtue of an eight-game unbeaten run and that seems to have continued into the new campaign. In Ricardo Fuller they have a striker whose attributes include more than a passing friendship with Usain Bolt. He was not at his most effective yesterday, but in holding play up, he was an obvious platform for attacking runs from Martin and and Martyn Woolford. Opening day: Millwall's Scott McDonald (left) is fouled by Leeds United's Luke Murphy . It was Woolford who twice had excellent chances to score Millwall's second in the opening moments after the break. First, he went clean through only to shoot straight at Silvestri. He then had a reasonable call for a penalty ignored when he was tripped by Sam Byram after beating two defenders. Hunt, meanwhile, blew Leeds best chance after a howler from David Forde, who left his line and failed to gather a loose ball. It fell to Hunt but his poked shot was cleared off the line by Dunne. That was as good as it got for Leeds, but after such a modest rise came a sharper fall when Lee Gregory was brought down late on and Shaun Williams scored the penalty.

Subs: Bettinelli, Rodallega, Fotheringham, Burn. Goal: Hoogland . Referee: Stephen Martin . Attendance: 17, 218 . Parker is usually Mr Reliable in the heart of midfield, but he was stripped of possession by Luke Hyam just after the half-hour mark. Hyam slipped Daryl Murphy through the right-hand channel and he breezed past the lightweight Shaun Hutchinson before finishing low past Jesse Joronen. And Hutchinson was exposed again when he only half-cleared a cross by Murphy on the hour, the ball falling perfectly for Portman Road favourite David McGoldrick, making his first appearance since February, to crash home from outside the box. Ipswich were excellent value for their lead though they were forced to cling on after Fulham’s Tim Hoogland pulled one back with a deflected effort four minutes from time that beat Dean Gerken at his near post. A Fulham equaliser would have been undeserved, though Magath know it will take time to readjust to life in the Championship after 13 years at a higher level, especially with such an altered team. Slow start: Ross McCormack failed to have any real impact as Fulham fell to a defeat in their opening game . His was a bold selection, with great faith shown in the stars of Fulham’s run to the FA Youth Cup final last season. Joronen, Moussa Dembele, Emerson Hyndman and Patrick Roberts were among those named in the squad. Thomas Eisfeld, the 21-year-old German talent signed from Arsenal, was named on the bench. Joronen, was called into action early on when he pushed Christophe Berra’s goalbound header over the bar after Tyrone Mings had delivered well from the left. Fulham had a golden chance to take the lead when Dean Gerken spilt a Chris David shot at the feet of Dembele, his rebound blocked by the relieved keeper. And they would rue that miss when Murphy opened the scoring just after the half-hour, to the delight of the 17,000-plus crowd enjoying the return of regular football on a gloriously sunny August afternoon. Work to do: There is plenty to think about for Felix Magath and his Fulham team, who need to adapt to this level . McCormack endured a frustrating start to his Fulham career and was replaced before the hour by Cauley Woodrow. He had barely had a sniff, marked out of the game by the Ipswich defenders. Magath afterwards admitted his expensive acquisition was some was short of the required match fitness. Almost immediately, Ipswich doubled their lead and the stuffing looked to have been knocked out of Fulham. To their credit, they rallied, improving massively after the introduction of tyro Roberts, who cut inside from the right to good effect. But it was Hoogland, the right-back brought in from Schalke over the summer, who actually made that tactic work to set up a grandstand finale.","Daryl Murphy bursts past Shaun Hutchinson to put Ipswich ahead .

"By . Sam Peters . England capitulated in spectacular fashion after lunch to fall to a humiliating 95-run defeat at Lord’s that leaves captain Alastair Cook’s future in grave doubt. Cook’s team lost six wickets for 50 runs either side of lunch to be bowled out for 223 in one of the most embarrassing displays of his increasingly disastrous spell in charge. England have now lost seven of their last 10 Tests and have not won in that period. It is their worst run in 21 years.

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Had India imagined the perfect way to humiliate England it would probably have ended with Ravindra Jadeja running out Jimmy Anderson after Ishant Sharma had bullied them into submission. You could barely make it up. This was as bad as it can get for the ‘new’ England, a sorry rout that will test the resolve of Alastair Cook, Peter Moores and everyone at the ECB who have placed so much faith in them to lead the recovery from the horrors of Australia. It was Andy Flower who said after the Ashes that life may have to get worse before it got better but even he surely could not have envisaged it would get this bad, with one England batsman after another crashing to sucker punches.

Falling short: Matt Prior was the first batsman to succumb to the short ball when he was caught by Murali Vijay . It is not the despair that gets to England followers. It is the hope they cannot stand. And for much of the final morning of this second Investec Test there was genuine hope England could make up for a mountain of missed opportunities here and pull off one of the great Lord’s run chases. We should have known better. Instead it was Ishant, something of a mocked figure in India, who  produced what will go down as one of the great spells of Indian fast bowling but which, in truth, was a case of collective English suicide. It is one thing being bombarded by Mitchell Johnson. It is quite another to be firstly outbowled by Sri Lanka and then bounced out in English conditions on a fifth-day Lord’s pitch by an Indian bowler barely touching 83mph. Yet that was the fate that befell England after Joe Root and Moeen Ali had taken them to the brink of lunch without further loss and to a position from which, with 146 needed and six wickets still in hand, they could afford to dream. The final ball before the interval changed all that. MS Dhoni, almost in desperation, had persuaded Ishant to bowl short but 14 came off the last over before lunch and Root had moved to an impressive half-century. And again: Ben Stokes looks to the heavens as the ball goes up into the air and is caught by Cheteshwar Pujara . And another one: Joe Root plays a reckless pull shot, again off Sharma, and is caught by Stuart Binny . Leaving a bad taste: Root tries to bite his bat as he walks off and (right) a despondent Prior . Then, inexplicably, Moeen ducked into the final ball and spooned a simple catch. Suddenly and decisively, everything changed. Dhoni stuck with the short-ball policy that had failed England and one by one English lemmings fell down the Lord’s slope to oblivion, Matt Prior, Ben Stokes, Root and Stuart Broad all gifting their wickets to Ishant and sparking wild Indian celebrations. So wild, in fact, that Ishant seemed to have to be pulled back from Prior as he walked off while Virat Kohli screamed in Root’s face after Stokes had completed his pair and then postured provocatively when the Yorkshireman was out. Time to go? The under-pressure Cook (second left) looking pensive on the Lord's balcony . VIDEO I will not walk away - Cook . It appears that bad feeling continues . between these sides — Anderson and Jadeja face Australian ICC judicial . commissioner Gordon Lewis on Tuesday over their confrontation in the . first Test.

Those . formalities would have been painful for Anderson, who saw his Trent . Bridge accuser Jadeja take the game away from England with the bat on . Sunday and then run him out with a direct hit that completed England’s . ignominy. It was all over by 2.46pm and Ishant had taken four for nine in 21 balls to finish with career-best figures of seven for 74 and conjure up memories of that day six years ago when he roughed up Ricky Ponting. This time his burst gave India only their second win at Lord’s, their first victory overseas in more than three years. What a mess it is for England. Cook, with the full backing of all at the ECB, insisted he will carry on but there was unspoken recognition that his position will become untenable if he loses this series and fails to regain form. He has three Tests to save his captaincy, beginning at the Ageas Bowl on Sunday, but how many of the senior players who were supposed to constitute the spine of this transitional side remain is questionable. England will name their third Test squad on Tuesday and it will not include Prior, even though he had been given the full backing of a  captain who wanted him alongside him in this demanding summer. Prior has simply not looked fit and it . was no surprise when he announced he would step away from the team for . the rest of the season in an attempt to regain full fitness. The time has come for another . exciting new face in Jos Buttler and Prior’s outstanding England career . is almost certainly at an end, even though he clearly does not want to . give up on one last crack at the Ashes just yet. Broad has virtually been bowling on one . leg in this game and, with the chance that Anderson will be banned later . in the series, England may rest his injured knee in Southampton and . give another chance to Chris Jordan.

But the stakes are too high for those who charged him with clearing up the debris of the Ashes to give up on Cook the captain just yet.

Southampton side have sold around £100million worth of players - including Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren to Liverpool, Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Calum Chambers to Arsenal - during the close season. They host the Baggies in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday after losing their opening game under Ronald Koeman, going down 2-1 at Liverpool.

At the double: Saido Berahino scored twice as West Brom drew 2-2 with Sunderland on the opening day . Positive start: £10.9m signing Dusan Tadic looked impressive on debut at Liverpool last weekend . But Irvine has told his side the Saints, who have spent £10.9million on Dusan Tadic from FC Twente and £8million on Graziano Pelle from Feyenoord, are still dangerous. 'Having been at Anfield last Sunday and watched how well they played and watched how many chances they were able to create at a really difficult place I think they can more than survive,' he said. 'I think they could have a very good season. They have spent the money very wisely and replaced very good players with very good players. 'I was very impressed with how they played at Anfield. Not many teams go to Anfield and make it go quiet but that certainly happened during periods of the game. 'They deserved something out of the game last week and I believe it will be a very tough place for teams to go this season.' On target: Nathaniel Clyne (right) scored at Anfield, in a game Southampton dominated for long spells . Danger man: Graziano Pelle was signed for £8m from Feyenoord . Koeman has replaced Lambert with former Baggie Shane Long in a £12million deal from Hull. The Republic of Ireland striker only joined Hull from Albion in January, scoring four goals in 15 games, and Irvine is aware of his threat. He said: 'He's a very good player for a start and is going to be an important player for them, sometimes former players come back to haunt you. 'We have just got to make sure if Shane does play from the start that we are ready to cope with the threat.' James Morrison and Joleon Lescott have resumed training but are not fit after knee injuries while new signing Georgios Samaras is not in the squad after signing on Friday. Irvine added: 'The good news is when we started training on Thursday, every player in the squad was there. That included Joleon, though he only did the first part of the session which is what was planned for him and then went and joined the fitness coach.'","Southampton sold £100m worth of players over the summer - including Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren .

"By . Janetta Harvey . What drew me to the sad little face staring mournfully out of my computer that day I can’t say. But of all the needy, vulnerable dogs on the rescue centre’s website, she seemed to be appealing directly to me for help. A pair of huge, pleading eyes was framed by the beguiling bushy brows and mutton chop whiskers of the classic miniature schnauzer. In the days that followed I simply couldn’t put the thought of that little creature from my mind. I gave myself a good talking to – my husband Michel and I already owned a boisterous puppy of the same breed, Renae. This was hardly the moment to introduce a traumatised rescue dog into our family. But something made me email the animal sanctuary. Janetta Harvey with her two miniature Schnauzer . Susie-Belle’s story was a terrible one. For six years she had lived – if you could call it that – in the cold and filth of one of Britain’s barbaric and all too numerous ‘puppy farms’. Tied up in the back of a putrid shed without natural light or companionship, she had been nothing more than a breeding machine. Twice a year, in a relentless cycle of enforced mating, Susie-Belle had produced litter after litter of babies to satisfy the commercial demands of the rough end of the dog-breeding trade. She would have been shot without mercy at the end of her working days. Breeding dogs like Susie-Belle are routinely kept in wire cages, often in the dark and sometimes stacked on top of each other – meaning that the animals lower down are left to live among the excrement falling from above, as well as their own filth. Their toes are splayed from standing on wire floors and many have hernias from prolonged, painful labours. Hideously distended stomachs and chronic back pain are the norm, the result of multiple pregnancies. Susie-Belle was saved thanks only to the courage of the dedicated animal rescuers who are prepared to go into these grisly places and persuade commercial puppy producers that there are homes that would welcome their worn-out dogs as pets. When I first read about her, she was being fostered by a wonderful woman called Janet who has helped countless ex-puppy farm dogs live out their final days surrounded by warmth and love. It was Janet to whom I spoke after reading about Susie-Belle, and with whom I arranged our first meeting. Susie-Belle was much smaller than I had imagined, very skinny, with a ragged looking coat that was a mixture of raw brown patches and her breed’s traditional pepper-and-salt hair. When she’d first been rescued she was almost bald, Janet explained, with only a few tufts of filthy fluff here and there. It was as much as I could do not to scoop that gentle creature up right away in my arms and give her the biggest hug she’d ever experienced. Susie-Belle spent much of her life in a puppy farm, much like this one . After a few more successful visits it was agreed that Michel and I could take Susie-Belle out for the afternoon to our local beauty spot in Surrey. Janet had warned us that Susie-Belle would not like anyone walking behind her – this, I later discovered, is very common among such dogs. It probably arises from the many times that they are kicked out of the way, grabbed by their tails, harshly handled and roughly mated. Nothing good happens to breeding bitches when people are behind them. And so it proved for the entire afternoon. Whenever Susie-Belle sensed anybody coming up behind us, she would stop still, firmly plant her feet in the ground and not move a muscle until that person had passed. But for the rest of her outing she was an absolute angel, trotting along perfectly at my heels on her lead. The following morning Janet reported that Susie-Belle had slept well and contentedly that night. It had been a success all round and I was floating on air. Susie-Belle became officially ours in the late summer of 2011. Perhaps it was only to be expected, but she was painfully quiet at first, sitting silently in her bed watching everything going on, but not really engaging with us at all. We would often find our puppy, Renae, taking her toys over to Susie-Belle to see if she wanted to play, but she never did. Life for a battery farm dog is not one where having fun is encouraged. 'Susie-Belle would have been shot without mercy . at the end of her working days. Breeding dogs like Susie-Belle are . routinely kept in wire cages, often in the dark and sometimes stacked on . top of each other' Although we couldn’t know for certain what her life had been like, we guessed that in the puppy farm she would have had very little to do apart from sitting still for hours on end. Through necessity, Susie-Belle had adopted a patient acceptance and learned just to be present, but to expect nothing. It saddened us dreadfully to see her like this, and to think of her sitting alone for all those years in a cold, hostile environment. To cheer ourselves up we would imagine instead that she had learned the art of meditation, achieving a Zen-like state of inner peace amid the misery that surrounded her. Far more likely, of course, was that in addition to her joyless past, the busy, noisy environment of the normal world was entirely overwhelming for this frightened little dog. In order to survive she’d no doubt carefully disengaged herself from it till she felt more ready to cope. We knew that it would take a long time for her to reach a state of sufficient relaxation to start feeling like a normal dog, so in order to speed things up I tried giving her a soothing massage – I have worked as a natural health practitioner and acupuncturist for a number of years, so for me it was the most obvious thing in the world to do. For Susie-Belle, though, it was initially far from a positive experience. I have never touched a living thing that felt so tense, whose skin bristled the moment my fingertips made contact. Dogs, like Susie-Belle, who are kept on puppy farms experience enforced mating twice a year . For several weeks Susie-Belle would lie statue still during these sessions, heartbreakingly compliant with what was happening but not relaxing a single cell of her body. It seemed a very long time before the surface tension in her muscles finally softened. The first time she let out a sigh of relaxed pleasure I could have wept with joy at what is for most dogs a normal sign of contentedness, but which for Susie-Belle was a major indication of progress and a huge step forward. Susie-Belle had arrived in our lives with a voracious appetite. Her fearfulness would temporarily fade at mealtimes and we indulged her in ways that would exceed most humans’ expectations of good food. She ate every meal as if it might be her last – and for a dog that had until recently known what it was to feel the pain of starvation, why not? In those first few weeks with us she experienced not only the sweet taste of freedom but delicious meals of venison, rabbit and hare plus delectable morsels of roast goose and lobster. While Susie-Belle’s physical recovery continued apace, I was still searching for ways to aid her mental healing. Some years previously we had re-homed an extremely nervous and aggressive cat that had been greatly helped by our local homeopathic vet. I had almost forgotten about the whole episode until Susie-Belle came to us, so desperately in need of expert assistance. Susie-Belle soon after she was rescued . What the vet said took me aback completely, and before I could stop it my eyes filled with tears. He told me that the most important thing to do for Susie-Belle was to help her let go of the crippling grief that she was suffering. It had never occurred to me that a dog might be affected by such a painful and disturbing emotion. But his view was that to live for years the way she had, being used to breed litter upon litter, to care for her puppies only to have them suddenly removed, probably too early, would have left her with enormous feelings of loss and bereavement over and over again. It was a revelation. I left his surgery that day feeling that my understanding of Susie-Belle’s suffering had broadened enormously. In the days that followed I gave her the homeopathic pills as instructed, although I wasn’t expecting any major changes to occur. Michel and I began to notice, however, very subtle signs of growing confidence. Susie-Belle began to interact with us whenever we initiated contact. One morning we got an awkward, stiff little dance with a light wagging of her docked tail when her breakfast was being prepared. She showed signs of wanting to be almost playful with Renae, bumping her haunches into the younger dog’s as she half danced around. We dared to hope that she was letting some of her trauma go. Sceptics may say that all this might have happened irrespective of the homeopathy. But we didn’t mind either way. We were just glad that good things were starting to happen. A day or so following her morning dance, we were out in the local park near a skateboard area full of children. Until that point, we had tended to give the place something of a wide berth with Susie-Belle, worried that she might have a bad reaction to all the movement and shouting. But that afternoon, as we moved away from the skateboarding, a most wonderful thing happened. For the first time since we’d owned her, Susie-Belle let out an almighty WOOF!, followed by a series of joyous barks. It was truly a sound to treasure. To my ears she was singing from her heart that day, on and on and on – a big, beautiful, slowly mending heart that was at last feeling ready to accept the richness of what life now offered her.

Researchers at Oregon State University found the condition, which affects millions around the world with dry, itchy and inflamed skin lesions, can be triggered by a malfunctioning protein known as Ctip2. It was already known that the Ctip2 controls body fats that keep skin healthy and hydrated, but researchers have now discovered that if the protein is not performing properly it can cause atopic dermatitis, a common type of eczema. Eczema allows significant loss of fluids through the skin, allowing allergens to penetrate. The findings, published in science journal PLoS ONE, may pave the way for new approaches to helping sufferers of eczema, which is difficult to treat and has no known cure, researchers claim. Arup Indra, an associate professor in the OSU College of Pharmacy said: 'In these studies, we've basically shown that inadequate Ctip2 is reducing the lipids in skin that it needs to stay healthy, protect itself and perform its function. 'At the same, time this can allow unwanted formation of proteins that trigger inflammation. 'The skin's ability to resist inflammation is going down just as the amount of inflammation is going up, and the underlying reason is that Ctip2 is not doing its job. Either or both of these problems can lead to eczema.' The condition, characterised by dry, itchy red skin, is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults. There is also a growing body of research indicating it may be linked to food or pollen allergens. A protein known as Ctip2 controls body fats that keep skin cells (pictured) healthy and hydrated, but in people with eczema, it may malfunction . Atopic dermatitis is associated with a dysfunctional immune response, but researchers have never understood the underlying cause. Existing treatments use moisturisers to try to protect skin, and in difficult cases powerful steroid drugs can help, but they often have significant unwanted side effects, especially in long-term use. Most people outgrow it as they reach adulthood, but some suffer from the condition their entire life. Mr Indra added: 'Our skin is the largest organ in the human body and one of the most important. 'It's our first barrier of defence, is in a constant battle against external insults, is influenced by both genetics and the environment, and has to be finely tuned to do many jobs. In eczema, this process begins to break down.' Commenting on the research, Margaret Cox, chief executive of the National Eczema Society, told MailOnline: 'Getting to the bottom of what genetic factors influence eczema is important, as long-term, this gives the best hope of prevention. 'At the moment, we are very much building a jigsaw and this is another piece. I am clearly delighted to see a new development, but we are still quite a way off from finding a treatment that switches this gene off and on.'

"By . Becky Evans . The head of Benetton has admitted it had links to the garment factory that collapsed last month killing almost 900 people. Biagio Chiarolanza, chief executive of the label, said the company bought shirts from New Wave Style, which was based at the building in capital Dhaka. Benetton is the latest company to admit links to the Rana Plaza building. Biagio Chiarolanza, Benetton chief executive, admitted the company had links to the Rana Plaza building that collapsed last month . Authorities are still clearing the site and recovering more bodies. The death toll has now reached 892 . Primark operated a floor of the eight-storey building and other garment makers inside the factory included suppliers to Matalan and Mango. Mr Chiarolanza told The Huffington Post that Benetton plan to stay in Bangladesh despite concerns over factory safety and work conditions in the country's £13billion garment industry. Yesterday eight people were killed when a fire broke out at another clothes factory in Dhaka. The death toll from the factory collapse reached 892, and it is not known how many more people may be buried under the rubble. Dozens of bodies recovered yesterday were so decomposed they were being sent to a lab for DNA identification, police said. Mr Chiarolanza said one of their direct Indian suppliers had subcontracted two orders to The New Wave company. It supplied about 200,000 shirts that were made inside the building. He added that one month before the collapse, Benetton had decided to stop using New Wave because it could not meet 'strict' quality and efficiency standards, according to The Huffington Post. Benetton, Primark, Matalan and Mango all had connections to the unsafe eight-storey factory . The Benetton boss said it will not pull out of the country despite the increasing safety concerns . The chief executive said the solution to the safety issues was not to abandon Bangladesh. He said: 'I spent some period of my life in this part of the world, and I believe - I really believe - Benetton and other international brands can help these countries improve their condition. 'But we need a safe and happy working environment and we need to have better conditions.' Benetton was heavily criticised after the collapse and accused of paying sub-poverty level wages. Mr Chiarolanza said they will now add more checks when assessing factories. The owner of the building only had permission for a five storey structure and there is speculation that his exceeding that was the cause of the collapse. More than 2,500 people were pulled from the rubble alive in the days following the disaster. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier said 3,122 workers were employed at the five factories housed in the building, but it was not clear how many were there during the packed morning shift. At least eight people have died in the fire that swept through a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh . A police officer and the factory's managing director were found dead after the blaze gutted the building . Police collect evidence from inside the gutted garment. It the latest disaster to hit the country's lucrative garment industry after more than 900 people died when a building collapsed . This morning eight people, including a . police officer and the factory's managing director, were found dead . after a blaze at an 11-storey clothes manufacturer in Dhaka. Yesterday's blaze broke out shortly after about 300 workers at the Tung Hai Sweater factory went home for the day, fire official Nazrul Islam said. It burned parts of the first and second floors, which housed the factory, and parts of the third, which housed apartments. It was not immediately clear how many of the dead were tenants of the building. Bhajan Kumar Sarkar, another fire official, said the managing director of the factory, Mahbubur Rahman, and a police official were among the dead. All the dead had been found in the stairwell. Mr Sarkar said it took more than three hours to bring the blaze under control. The fire at the Tung Hai Sweater factory started after most of the 300 workers had left for the day . A mound of burnt sweaters lies inside the factory. The fire spread through parts of the first and second floors . The garment industry in Bangladesh is worth £13billion but concerns over safety have been raised recently . Following protests, authorities also began paying salaries and other benefits to survivors. The European Union's delegation to Bangladesh urged the government to 'act immediately' to improve working conditions and authorities said the government had closed 18 clothes factories in recent days for failing to meet work and safety standards. There is no clear indication of how many bodies still remain trapped in the debris because the exact number of people inside the building at the time of the collapse is unknown. More than 2,500 people were rescued alive. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier said 3,122 workers were employed at the five factories housed in the building, but it was not clear how many were there during the packed morning shift when it collapsed. Several stores and a bank were also in the building. A ceiling fan has been burnt and melted by the heat of the devastating blaze in Mirpur . Factory workers wait outside the gutted 11-storey building that houses the Tung Hai Sweater Ltd . The government had closed 18 clothes factories in recent days for failing to meet safety standards . Ratings agency Moody's said clothing factory disasters in Bangladesh and frequent, increasingly violent strikes posed risks to the country's credit rating. It said political tension was damaging confidence in Bangladesh, which has a rating below investment grade. A general strike was called earlier this week by opposition political parties to protest at the deaths of at least 29 people during street demonstrations. Investor confidence in Bangladesh also dropped after the deadly factory blaze two weeks ago . Moody's says 'continued political tensions are credit negative because they may further damage investor confidence in Bangladesh against the background of recurrent industrial disasters in the ready-made garment sector'. Bangladesh's rating from Moody's is Ba3, three notches below the lowest investment grade rating.","Chief executive Biagio Chiarolanza said company bought shirts from factory .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Admission: Former Flamengo goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes de Souza told a court that his girlfriend had been killed, chopped up and fed to dogs . A star Brazilian goalkeeper jailed for 22 years for ordering the kidnap and murder of his girlfriend, who was dismembered and fed to his pet dogs, could be released to play football. Bruno Fernandes de Souza, 28, confessed to the horrific crimes last March after his ex-girlfriend Eliza Samudio was murdered. But despite his confession and prison sentence, the goalkeeper was allowed to sign a five-year contract with Montes Claros of the Campeonato Mineiro, upi.com reported. It means Bruno could be allowed to leave prison on day release, accompanied by a police escort, to train with the team and play in matches. But before the contract can be approved and the day release considered a judge will have to grant his approval. The former Flamengo captain is said to have wanted his ex-partner dead so he could avoid paying child support after she gave birth to his love child. Her dead body was allegedly fed to Bruno's pet rottweilers. Bruno, who was tipped to play for Brazil at the 2014 World Cup, was sentenced to 22 years and three months for the murder. He has been behind bars since 2010 and is said to be preparing a case to take advantage of a provision in Brazilian law that allows a prisoner more freedom after three or four years, so long as they have shown good behaviour. Montes Claros club president, Ville Mocellin, confirmed the controversial decision to allow Bruno to sign a contract while he is behind bars. 'We want to give an opportunity to the man Bruno,' he told OTempo. 'For him, it is a chance to return to play. To the club, he is an athlete who can strengthen the team and a way to invest in the social side.' Judge Marixa Fabiane Rodrigues said the goalkeeper, who played for Brazil's biggest team Flamengo, had 'meticulously calculated' Ms Samudio's execution. He told the court in Contagem, south-east Brazil, that the footballer was 'twisted' and had 'instilled in his personality a total misunderstanding of values.' He added: 'Bruno believed that, by making the body disappear, he could ensure total impunity.' The former player had previously denied any knowledge of what happened to the 25-year-old, but told a court last March how his best friend Luiz Henrique Romao had paid someone to kill her. He admitted that although he hadn't ordered his former lover to be killed, he had 'accepted' it. Jailed: Bruno Souza, former goalkeeper of Brazil's Flamengo soccer club, has been sentenced to 22 years and three months in prison for the murder of his former lover . Model: Eliza Samudio is believed to have met Bruno at a party held by another footballer. She later presented a report (left) to police against the footballer, claiming he had got her pregnant . The goalkeeper is accused of planning . Ms Samudio's abduction and murder with eight others including his wife . Dayane, another former lover, a cousin and former policeman Marcos . Santos. It has been alleged that he watched as Santos tortured her and then helped him to chop her body. Parts of the woman's corpse are alleged to have been fed to Bruno's pet rottweillers, while the rest was buried in concrete. At . an earlier trial, Romao was found guilty of Ms Samudio's murder and . jailed for 15 years. Santos will be put on trial next month. Fernandes, . who before his arrest had been linked with a multi-million pound . transfer to AC Milan, has always claimed Ms Samudio was alive and had . left the country. Her body has never been found. But he told the court in Contagem that his cousin, Jorge Rosa, who had witnessed the murder, had told him what had happened. He . claimed that after kidnapping Ms Samudio, Romao had taken her to a . house in Belo Horizonte where hired killer Santos was waiting. Broke down: Souza, 28, is seen in the Forum of Contagem, metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, southeastern Brazil, this week . He said: 'There he held her hands and asked [Romao] to tie them in front of her, and put a tie around her neck. 'And [Romao] even kicked Eliza's legs . away. That's what Jorge told me. And that they had chopped up her body, . that they had thrown her body for the dogs to eat.' The former star admitted that he feels 'guilty' for her death despite instisting that he never oredered the killing. Ms . Samudio, who had previously claimed to have had an affair with Real . Madrid ace Cristiano Ronaldo, met Bruno at a footballers' party in May . 2009 and fell pregnant by accident, it is claimed. The . goalkeeper demanded she have an abortion but she went ahead with the . pregnancy, instead insisting that he assume paternity of the child. Before her disappearance on June 4, 2010, Ms Samudio had approached police claiming she had been held captive by Bruno and his associates, who forced her to take an illegal abortion drug. Bruno allegedly put a gun to her head and told her: 'You don't know who I am or what I'm capable of - I'm from the favela.' The baby, Bruninho, was born in February 2010, but the player refused to acknowledge he was the father. Prosecutors allege that Bruno ordered Ms Samudio's murder after she told him she would take legal action to force him to pay child support. Under arrest: The footballer is seen here being taken into custody in 2010 in connection with the disappearance of his girlfriend . In . a statement to police, the footballer's teenage cousin Jorge Rosa . claimed he and Romao picked up Ms Samudio and her son from a Rio de . Janeiro hotel after she accepted an invitation by the footballer to talk . about the paternity claims. He . said they drove her 220 miles to a property in Belo Horizonte which . Bruno and his wife used as a weekend retreat, where she was held captive . for six days. Ms Samudio . was then allegedly handed over to former military policeman Santos, who . committed 'barbaric tortures' on her before strangling her to death with . a neck tie in front of her four-month-old son. Santos, . who was allegedly paid £8,000 to murder her, played loud music on a . stereo to drown out the woman's screams, it is claimed. Edson . Moreira, a detective who investigated the case, said: 'His acts were . almost impossible to describe without breaking down - images from the . worst nightmare you could imagine.' Police . later found Ms Samudio's four-month-old baby in a Belo Horizonte slum, . alleged to have been abandoned there by Bruno's wife Dayane. DNA tests . later proved the footballer's paternity. The child is now being looked . after by Ms Samudio's mother.

"By . Jason Groves . High demand: Planning Minister Nick Boles warned 100,000 new homes will be built to accommodate the expanding British population . Vast swathes of the countryside will have to be sacrificed to build new homes for immigrants, the Planning Minister warned last night. Nick Boles said migrants accounted for almost half of the housing demand, and his figures suggest 100,000 new homes a year will be needed to accommodate them. The minister added: ‘We can’t go on like this.’ Earlier this week, Mr Boles alarmed conservationists by saying up to two million acres of green fields may have to be concreted over to deal with the housing shortage. Now he has become the first government minister to draw a clear link between housing demand and the legacy of Labour’s open-door immigration policy. Mr Boles said: ‘The fact is – and I am critical of the lastgovernment’s immigration policies – we allowed the population of this country to expand dramatically. ‘The population of England has gone up by two million in the last ten years. These people now live here, these people are now British and they need homes just like other British people. ‘The fact is, 43 per cent of the new households which want a home, is accounted for by immigration. ‘We can’t go on like this. We need to have less immigration and more house-building and we might then have a civilised country.’ Mr Boles warned the scale of demand meant large swathes of countryside would have to be sacrificed, because there were not enough empty homes or developed sites. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said last month that the number of households was forecast to expand at the rate of 230,000 a year. The figure supplied by Mr Boles suggests that immigration will account for almost 100,000 of the total. Mr Clegg said total house building amounted to just 117,000 last year, adding: ‘There’s only one way out of this housing crisis: We have to build our way out.’ Sir Andrew Green, founder of the think-tank MigrationWatch, said the public would be shocked by the figures, which are significantly higher than the Government’s previous estimate on the issue, which suggested immigration accounted for 36 per cent of new households. Sir Andrew said: ‘At last a housing minister has been absolutely clear about the link between housing demand and immigration. The best way to deal with the housing crisis is to reduce immigration.’ At risk: With a lack of both empty homes and developed sites where new homes could be built, Green Belt land may have to be sacrificed . Mr Boles angered conservationists by suggesting the total area of land under development should be increased by a third to ease the housing shortage. He said ministers would protect the Green Belt, but warned that large areas of ‘open land’ may have to be given over for housing. And he hit out at developers for building ‘pig ugly’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development. Road to recovery: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg suggest we build our way out of the housing crisis . ‘We’re going to protect the Green Belt but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land,’ Mr Boles said. ‘In the UK and England at the moment we’ve got about 9 per cent of land developed. All we need to do is build on another 2 to 3 per cent of land and we’ll have solved a housing problem.’ The National Trust accused Mr Boles of making up figures ‘on the back of a fag packet’, while the Campaign to Protect Rural England said his proposals were a licence to developers to ‘let rip’. The new row underlines the scale of the challenge posed to Britain’s creaking infrastructure by the mass immigration policy presided over by Labour. Critics claim that schools, hospitals and the welfare system have also been placed under massive strain by the decision to lift restrictions on those coming to live and work in this country. The new figures will also place fresh pressure on ministers to deliver on David Cameron’s pre-election pledge to slash net migration by more than half, to fewer than 100,000 a year. Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered officials to examine whether restrictions could even be placed on those coming here from other parts of the European Union. Figures out this week revealed that the Government’s immigration cap is having an effect, with officials recording the biggest fall in numbers for 20 years. The net migration figure – the number added to the population after both immigration and emigration have been counted – dropped by nearly 25 per cent from 242,000 to 183,000.","Figures suggest 100,000 new homes a year is needed to house immigrants .

"By . Harriet Arkell For Mailonline . A pair of friends who dreamt up Marmite-themed board games during drunken dinners together have told how they won £50,000 backing from the Dragons' Den investment show. Father of two Richard McLuckie, 48, and his friend Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, dreamt up a series of board games including Love It Or Hate It and Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine. They won permission to use the name Marmite from brand owner, Unilever, before going onto Dragons' Den to ask for funding. But the pair, who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in Argyll, nearly lost their chance when they weren't allowed to mention the name Marmite to the inquisitive Dragons. Scroll down for video . The friends came up with the idea of Marmite-themed board games - and persuaded the Dragons to invest . Dragons Duncan Bannatyne, second left, and Peter Jones, second right, put up £50,000 for the board games . Mr McLuckie, a former property developer who lives near Avignon, France, with his French wife, Betty, 43, and their daughters Clara, 15, and Esmee, 13, said: 'Unilever had agreed to the licensing contract but told us we couldn't mention Marmite on the show as they hadn't yet agreed the design of the game. 'They didn't want any mention of it til it was signed off, so we were worried the Dragons wouldn't be interested.' Three Dragons took their money off the table early, leaving Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones demanding to know more. Mr McLuckie said: 'We told them we couldn't say the name but it was an iconic brand and a well-known supermarket brand. 'Eventually they demanded to see paperwork and when we showed it to them, Peter Jones said ""Oh it's Marmite"", and they agreed to invest. Jones and Bannatyne said they would buy a 40 per cent stake in the men's games start-up, Pants On Fire, and the games will go on sale next month. Love It Or Hate It, the title of which is based on the idea that Marmite provokes strong reactions one way or the other, is a game in which couples and friends can find out how much they know about each other. Inventor and board games enthusiast Richard McLuckie, 48, with some of the games he has dreamed up . The idea for Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge came to Mr McLuckie when he realised that his French wife was putting the Marmite in the fridge, meaning it was unspreadable on his toast every morning. He said: 'My wife always puts it in the fridge which makes it like concrete, and now my children do the same thing, and every morning I ask the same thing. 'It occurred to me it would be a great name for a board game.' He and Mr Mackenzie-Walker developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years, but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and Mr McLuckie needed a new job. First they came up with Liar Liar, in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made-up facts, and Eurobabble, a modern version of Chinese Whispers in which players translate from one language to another and another. In Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, players have to avoid being left with the jar of Marmite. Mr McLuckie and his childhood friend Mr Mackenzie-Walker, right, spent many nights playing board games . Mr McLuckie and Mr Mackenzie-Walker, an accountant by trade who moved from Kent to southern Spain, have now had their games snapped up by shops including John Lewis, WH Smith, Waterstones and Amazon. They appeared on Dragons' Den last night, and said their preconceptions about the Dragons were shattered after meeting them. 'We thought we'd really like Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen but in fact we thought Piers was quite dull and Kelly was a little bit rude and dismissive,' Mr McLuckie said. 'Deborah Meaden was a surprise, as we thought she would be hard-nosed when in fact she was absolutely delightful - so lovely. 'We thought Peter Jones would be fun, which he was, and we thought Duncan Bannatyne would be a hard task-master, when in fact he was lovely - we are so pleased to be working with those two. 'They're both great to work with and a really good laugh, too.'","Richard McLuckie, 48, and Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, invented games .

"By . Nick Enoch . 'Welkom in Orania' proclaims a mural, painted in white, blue and orange. But this South African town, in the remote Northern Cape province, does not extend its welcome to everyone. The colour scheme on the wall - accompanied by the community emblem of a boy pulling up his sleeves - harks back to the old apartheid flag. Orania, one of the last outposts of racial segregation, is a whites-only enclave. Around 1,000 people live in the rural community, established in 1991 during the last years of apartheid. A young boy plays by a painted wall reading 'Welkom in Orania' in Afrikaans in the whites-only enclave . Afrikaner pupils attend a lesson with their teacher in the 'white' town founded in the desolate Northern Cape province in 1991 . Curator of the Orania Museum, Gideon de Kock. The town comprises around 1,000 Afrikaners who strive to be self-sufficient . Built on 8,000 hectares of private farmland along the Orange River in the desolate region of Karoo, it has schools, a museum and even its own currency, the Ora. All the residents are Afrikaners - descendants of white migrants of Dutch and German heritage - who make up about 7 per cent of South Africa's population. Yet despite there being no black faces in sight, they insist the town is not racist. 'When new people come to Orania, they are . interviewed by a group of people to make sure that they have sufficient . understanding of what the town is about,' Carel Boshoff IV, the . son of the late founder of the town, Carel Boshoff III, told Sowetan Live. Carel is also the great son-in-law of former prime minister Henrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid. Many of the inhabitants of Orania are farmers or traders, and prefer to have as little dealing as possible with the outside world . The de Beer family are among those who have chosen to make Orania their home . Built on 8,000 hectares of private farmland along the Orange River in the desolate region of Karoo, the town has schools, shops and even its own currency, the Ora. Above, the Jonck family . Among those to have made Orania their home is Kobus Jonck, a sheep farmer who moved there with his family last year. 'We are safe here. We do not worry about locking our cars at night, even the . (house) doors... they are never locked,' he said. Orania's motto is 'Working for freedom' - and many other inhabitants like him are self-sufficient farmers or traders. Racial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under Dutch and British rule but became official policy in 1948, enforced through legislation by the National Party - the majority of whom were Afrikaners. A cashier holds Orania's currency. The town authorities hope that one day, Orania will become an independent state . Radio presenters work at Orania's only local station. The town population is said to be growing at a rate of 9 per cent a year . Fast forward to the present day, and Orania's town authorities believe what they're doing is the best way to preserve Afrikaner culture and language. They hope that, eventually, the town will become an independent state for the Afrikaner people, who total 3million. Its officials claim the population is growing at a rate of 9 per cent a year. Furthermore, Orania is protected under article 235 of South Africa's Constitution . which ensures the right to self-determination. Carel Boshoff, president of the Orania movement and son of the late founder of Orania, also called Carel Boshoff. He is the great son-in-law of late prime minister Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid . Members of Orania's municipal council hold a meeting . Statues of apartheid 'heroes' are displayed above the town . The legislation recognises 'the notion of the right of self-determination of any community sharing a common cultural and language heritage within a territorial entity within the republic'. But despite their optimism, some residents are uncomfortable about the future. In 1995, in a conciliatory gesture, Nelson Mandela went to Orania to meet Betsie Verwoerd - the widow of Hendrik, the man who virtually invented white rule, and who sent Mandela to jail . One waiter at a bar is convinced 'black South Africans will kill all white people' when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela dies. Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994 after spending 27 years in prison for his fight against racist apartheid rule, and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. In 1995, in a conciliatory gesture, he went to Orania to meet Betsie Verwoerd - the widow of the man who virtually invented white rule, and who sent Mandela to jail. The town boasts a statue of her husband, Hendrik, who was assassinated in 1966. She said she was happy the then 77-year-old president was able to visit her. But Betsie's granddaughter, Elizabeth van der Berg, was more guarded in her reaction, saying, 'We wish he was the president of a neighboring country.' After Mrs Verwoerd and Mandela shared a cup of coffee and some cakes, the apartheid architect's widow read a speech in Afrikaans as she leaned on her cane. 'I identify myself with the wishes of my people for a volkstaat ['people's state'], which I believe could be developed in this part of the country,' she said, according to an English translation of her speech. But Mandela said: 'I want a united South Africa, where we can cease to think in terms of color.' A desire that is shared by many.","Residents of whites-only enclave in Northern Cape province insist they're not racist .

"By . Associated Press . Joran van der Sloot, the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, has been moved to a remote Peruvian penitentiary after authorities said he threatened to kill the warden of the prison where he was serving a 28-year term for murder. Peruvian prison spokeswoman Janeth Sanchez told The Associated Press that the 27-year-old Dutchman was moved Sunday to Challapalca, located high in the Andes near the Bolivian border. He previously was held at a prison north of Lima. Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to Aruba. He is imprisoned for killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old Peruvian business student in 2010. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

He married his pregnant Peruvian girlfriend in a prison ceremony last month. Prison officials prohibited video and photos during the midday nuptials and none of the groom's relatives attended, said his attorney, Maximo Altez. Wearing a tailored suit and dress shoes sent by his mother, Van der Sloot told his bride, who is eight months pregnant, that after he is released from prison, 'I want to marry you again,' and she told him the same,' said John Barrera, who officiated the wedding as mayor of the city of Ancon, where his former prison is located. The blushing bride showed off her growing baby bump in a conservative white ‘mullet’ dress paired with a matching shawl. To complete her wedding day look, Figueroa wore a flower in her hair.Van der Sloot met and fell in love with Figueroa while she was selling goods inside the prison, according to his attorney. Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Altez showed an oil painting given to him by Van der Sloot depicting a tall, solitary woman in a red dress on a palm-studded beach under a radiant sun.

The bride: Van der Sloot met and fell in love with Figueroa while she was selling goods inside the prison . The attorney, who acted as a witness during the ceremony, was one of only four people in attendance, among them another lawyer and the bride’s mother. Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot. In 2011, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for payment. The newlyweds met at the prison, where Figueroa, an accountant by training with a young son from a previous relationship, sells candy and cigarettes to inmates. 'They became friends and spent a lot of time together in his cell,' Altez told CNN earlier this year. 'Unlike the United States, here in Peru, loved ones or relatives can see inmates inside their jails.'Figueroa is due to give birth to Van der Sloot's child in September.

Prime suspect: Joran van der Sloot is the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway . Peruvian media have floated the possibility that Van der Sloot decided to get married to avoid extradition to the U.S. at the end of his prison term. But his attorney has dismissed the suggestion that the nuptials were a calculated move.‘He's getting married because he's in love and is having a child,’ Altez said in May. ‘There are no hidden agendas.’ Leidy Figueroa told CBS News' Crimesider earlier this year that she usually visits Van der Sloot twice a week and brings him home-cooked meals. According to the bride, the convict has become a new person and is enjoying his prison arts and crafts classes.

"By . Andy Dolan for the Daily Mail . A couple who have been married for more than 60 years are being forced to live apart after a ‘wicked’ carer plundered their life savings. Grandparents Rodney and Lily Crowder were left unable to pay care home fees to allow them to stay together – and will now have to live 17 miles away from each other. The couple had trusted Caroline Davis so much they gave her their bank cards and pin numbers so she could withdraw cash to do their shopping. 'Wicked' carer Caroline Davis arriving at Lincoln Crown Court, Lincoln. She was jailed  for six months over a devastating breach of trust . But the Crowders, who married in 1951 and are now in their eighties, were left distraught after discovering Davis, who also cleaned and paid bills for them, had raided the accounts of more than £20,000 – withdrawing between £40 and £250 a time. The hairdresser had also taken at least two chequebooks belonging to the couple, crudely forging their signatures to pay herself up to £750 with each transaction. A court heard Mrs Crowder was left ‘incredulous’ by Davis’s betrayal and when told about the fraud replied ‘but she’s my friend’. Davis, 38, was jailed for six months over the breach of trust. Recorder Gareth Evans QC told her: ‘What you did was wicked. The effect on the Crowders has been immense. In their last years together they have been separated. ‘There are too many people ripping off old people in this country. People must start to realise that if they come before the court the almost inevitable sentence for this sort of offence is immediate custody.’ Lincoln Crown Court heard the fraud was only uncovered after Mr Crowder, 84, a retired telecoms worker, was admitted to a care home with dementia in June 2012. Mrs Crowder, an 81-year-old former midwife, moved to the home in Boston, Lincolnshire, in order to remain close to him. Although they should have had the money in the bank to pay the fees, by September she was forced to return to the couple’s home in Spalding, 17 miles away, because the cost was draining what money they had left. Lily and Rodney Crowder at their 60th wedding anniversary party. The pensioners have been left devastated after a carer emptied their bank accounts of more than £20,000 . While Mr Crowder was assessed as being in need of care because of his dementia – and therefore eligible for help with the costs – Mrs Crowder was not. It meant that the £900-a-week fees for Mr Crowder have been partially covered by the NHS, but the couple were liable for the £600-a-week fees for his wife. The court heard Davis – who had met Mrs Crowder when she became her hairdresser – continued her caring duties but the Crowders’ son, Rod, 56, had become suspicious and cancelled the bank cards and contacted police. While the cash withdrawals from ATMs stopped, Davis still had the chequebooks and began forging their signatures. Michael Cranmer-Brown, prosecuting, said Davis had left the family feeling ‘betrayed’. When arrested she claimed she initially took £40 a time while under financial pressure, intending to pay it back. Bank records showed £5,530 was taken from Mrs Crowder’s bank account and £6,530 from Mr Crowder’s account. She also fraudulently obtained £11,750 using the couple’s chequebook. Davis, a married mother, from Surfleet, Lincolnshire, admitted fraud between November 2011 and July last year, on the basis that only £20,000 of the cash was for her own gain. She was jailed on Friday and was also ordered to repay the £20,000. The Crowders have three children, Rod, Chloe, 52, and Simon, 48. Rod said Davis had been trusted ‘almost as family’. He added: ‘Mum and Dad are heartbroken. They should be together. This is the first time they’ve really been apart since they’ve been married. ‘When the compensation comes through we will make sure they are together in the same care home but the house will have to be sold.’","Caroline Davis raided bank accounts of Rodney, 84, and Lily Crowder, 81 .

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . William Shakespeare was probably depressed when he wrote King Lear and decided to change its ending at the last minute to kill off all the major characters, experts have said. Simon Russell Beale, who played the main character in Sam Mendes' recent production at the National Theatre, said it is so 'savage' the Bard must have been going through a 'bad patch'. Shakespeare's celebrated tragedy, written between 1605 and 1606, ends with Lear collapsing and dying on top of his daughter Cordelia, after she is hanged. Was Shakespeare depressed? Simon Russell Beale, who played King Lear in Sam Mendes recent production at the National Theatre, left, says the Bard, right, must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature' Throughout the play Lear's empire and his own health declines as he suffers disaster after disaster while deceitful, conniving and murderous characters help destroy his life. Mr Beale, who has considered Shakespeare's state of mind for the BBC Four documentary The Secret Life of Books, says the playwright must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature'. He wrote Lear at the same time as Timon of Athens, and describes them both as 'savage'. He said: 'It must have been very depressing to write. It's as if Shakespeare can't stop this flow of invective and bile. 'So perhaps, I'm suggesting, he himself was depressed. He temporarily lost faith in human nature.' Betrayal: Lear wants to split his kingdom between his three daughters, but while Goneril and Regan (pictured with Lear) agree buy declaring their love for their father, the child who truly loves him, Cordelia, is banished and is eventually killed as the King goes mad . King Lear starts with the ageing Monarch announcing he will give his three daughters a third of his kingdom each, provided they declare their love for him. His manipulative children Goneril and Regan agree but Cordelia, the only child who truly loves him, says she can't because she loves him more than her tongue can ever say. Lear flies into a fury and banishes her and later, as he descends into madness and fails to reconcile with Cordelia before she is killed. According to research King Lear's first version was different but changed to 'obliterate a happy ending entirely'. 'I wonder if he was going through a bad patch. I know it's a dangerous game to play, but I can't believe you do something so violent to your source material as that without a personal investment of some kind,' he said. Sam Mendes, who directed King Lear at the National and also films like James Bond's latest film Skyfall said the 'truly dark play' is filled with 'shocking violence'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They say who you are is written all over your face - except, perhaps, when it comes to your sexuality. A new study reveals most people can't tell if a man is gay just by looking at his dial because homosexuals tend to have more 'masculine' features than straights. Debunking the myth that all gays are effeminate, the research found homosexuals tend to have 'wider and shorter faces, smaller and shorter noses, and rather massive and more rounded jaws' compared with straight guys. Under the gaydar: A new study shows the faces of gay men may be deemed more masculine than straight men as they generally have wider jaws, shorter noses and shorter faces . Interesting: The study found it was hard for people to determine a man's sexuality by looking at his face . Huffington Post reported researchers from the Center for Theoretical Study at Charles University, Prague, and The Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic examined the faces of gays and straights in two studies. The first analyzed whether gay . men have noticeably different facial features than straight men. After reviewing the portraits of 80 men - 40 gay and 40 straight white, . Czech men - and comparing more than . 11,000 coordinates, researchers found gay men have distinct 'morphological features' which are generally more masculine. The second study examined whether sexual orientation could be determined based . solely on these features. Openly gay: Actor Neil Patrick Harris (left) came out after he met his partner and singer Ricky Martin (right) revealed he used to make fun of gay people before he publicly outed himself . Forty female and 40 male students were asked to rate the sexual orientation of the 66 . participants - 33 gay, 33 straight - on a scale of one to seven, with one indicating a very . straight look and seven indicating a very gay look. Raters were also . asked to rank masculinity and femininity from one to seven, with one . indicting very masculine and seven indicating very feminine. The face shapes of gay men were rated as more masculine than those of straight men. The respondents also couldn't correctly determine sexual orientation from the pictures.

'It's necessary to point out to possible . misunderstandings of our results. 'The fact that we have . found some significant morphological differences between homosexual and . heterosexual men does not mean that any of the groups is easily . recognizable on the street (and our Study 2 actually shows that it's not . that easy to guess anyone's sexual orientation without knowing it), or . that anything like that should be done (like pointing on people with our . illustrations and guessing who is who).'","New study shows faces of gay men are perceived as more 'masculine' than those of straight men .

"By . Jim Norton . Baroness Rawlings has come up with money-saving tips to help those struggling to make ends meet . Her previous money-sabing tips may have raised a few eyebrows. She suggested that people should use electric blankets to cut energy bills last winter was greeted with derision. Now Baroness Rawlings – who lives in a 13-bedroom £5.75m country mansion and was married to a multi-millionaire – has raised eyebrows again after revealing another list of tips on thrifty living. The Tory peer suggested people should keep crusts from Melba toast for next day’s boiled egg, reuse their linen, use a bath to warm the room – and never throw anything away. The former MEP and government whip was derided for being ‘out of touch’ with voters. For those struggling to make ends meet, her advice on how to save money on marquee hire for a garden party may be particularly galling. Baroness Rawlings, who has thrown parties at her £5.75million, 38-acre country estate near Sandringham in Norfolk, said that the solution was to just buy 200 Panama hats to keep the sun off guests. And take them inside if it rained. The advice will do little to quell accusations that the 75-year-old, who was once married to Baron Wolfson of Sunningdale, is out of touch with austerity Britain. In an interview with Tatler, she suggested never serving plated food because it encourages waste. Instead, she advised that guests should serve themselves rather than risk scraping unwanted food into the bin. She added: ‘Supermarket waste is minor compared with plate waste, It’s an unmentioned disgrace.’ Growing your own apples, pears and quinces is also helpful, she said. She also removes crusts when making Melba toast and fry them as soldiers to go with boiled eggs for Sunday breakfast. The 75-year-old Baroness lives in a 13-bedroom country which is spread over 38 acres near Sandringham, Norfolk . Baths should be piping hot but then left to stand for a couple of hours after you’ve washed to warm the room. Other tips include buying and selling on eBay, keeping everything — wrapping paper, string, newspapers, carrier bags – and buying large bars of soap. Baroness Rawlings is reportedly moving somewhere smaller after separating from her most recent husband, financier Paul Zuckerman. In December, Baroness Rawlings was castigated in some quarters for suggesting electric blankets were an easy and economical way to keep warm in winter. Lady Rawlings explained that her make-do-and-mend attitude has prompted . her to mend her own socks and sheets, although she favours the . ‘beautiful thin socks’ made by the Pope’s tailor which cost £25 per . pair.","Baroness Rawlings has dished out advice to those struggling with money .

"By . James Slack . Ministers threw a cloak of secrecy yesterday over how many Romanians and Bulgarians they expect to flood into the country. To fury at Westminster, the Immigration Minister snubbed four MPs who asked him to reveal the figures – saying he did not want to scare people. Mark Harper said it would not be ‘helpful’ to let the public know what to expect when border controls are lifted in less than 11 months. It is feared the wall of secrecy will leave town halls, schools and hospitals unable to prepare properly. Long wait: The visa queue at the British Embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria as the Immigration Minister snubbed questions on how many Romanians and Bulgarians were expected to flood the country, saying he did not want to scare people . Tory MPs said it was ‘madness’ to . throw open the UK’s borders without giving voters an idea of what to . expect. The Government has carried out a study on how many of the . 29million citizens of Romanian and Bulgaria might move to the UK when . they get full EU rights in January. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles – . who has seen the figures, and has warned of a potential shortage of . housing – previously indicated they would be made available for public . debate. But, amid heated exchanges in the . Commons yesterday, Mr Harper refused to share what the Government knows. He was asked repeatedly either to release the data or to explain what . the Government was doing to deter a new wave of migration from Eastern . Europe. Migrants from Romania and Bulgaria will receive only the minimum level of benefits when they arrive in the UK, the Government has said . Mr Harper replied that he was . chairing a Whitehall committee to look at how to stop migrants abusing . the benefits system. Ideas include trying to make it harder for . newcomers to access benefits or ask them to carry residence cards. He told MPs: ‘Speculative projections . about future inflows cannot be made with any degree of accuracy and are . therefore not particularly helpful. That’s why the Government is . focused on dealing with the abuse of free movement rights and also . reducing the pull factors for migration. We want to make sure that when . people look at the access to our benefits and our public services that . no one thinks we are a soft touch in this country.’ Concern: Immigration minister Mark Harper, left, says that the Government will ensure that the UK is no 'soft touch' when it comes to Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants, but Labour MP Keith Vaz, right, says the Government is 'confused' over the matter . An estimate by the MigrationWatch . think-tank has suggested the number of arrivals will average 50,000 a . year for the first five years – the equivalent of a city the size of . Newcastle or Plymouth. Tensions are rising among Tory MPs who want the Government to take firm action. They fear David Cameron’s promise to . reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ will be fatally . undermined if large numbers arrive from Romania and Bulgaria, two of the . poorest countries in the EU. Currently, they are subject to . transitional controls which limit the number of work permits available . to low-skilled workers to around 20,000 a year. But, from the start of . 2014, these arrangements will be abandoned, giving workers free access . to the UK jobs market. Speaking at Home Office Questions, . Tory Philip Hollobone said his constituents believed it was ‘madness to . open our borders to 29million people’. He called for ministers to force EU . nationals who wanted to live in the UK for more than three months to . apply for a residency card. Immigration ministers are examining the UK's current welfare rules in a debate in the House of Commons . His colleague David Ruffley said . action must be taken to curb ‘welfare tourism that can only add to . British public spending’. Another Tory, James Clappison, asked Mr Harper . specifically to comment on the MigrationWatch estimate of 50,000 a . year. But Mr Harper repeatedly refused to provide any indication of . numbers. He said: ‘We want to make sure that we offer what we need to under the treaties, but no more.’ Ministers say they do not want to . create ‘scare’ stories – which some MPs have taken to mean the figure is . high. However, an alternative scenario is that the number produced by . officials is low, and would make the Government a hostage to fortune. Labour has never recovered from saying a mere 13,000 people would come . from Poland in 2004, only for hundreds of thousands of workers to . arrive. Last night there were new demands to publish the figures. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of . MigrationWatch, said: ‘There is surely a need for an intelligent . estimate. The worst option, surely, is just to muddle on.’ Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the . Home Affairs Select Committee, accused the Government of being . ‘confused’ on the issue and urged ministers to commission research on . how many immigrants were likely to arrive.","A committee is examining current UK benefit rules .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A Manchester United fan says his new £90 kit has been 'ruined' after his favourite player Adnan Januzaj switched squad numbers. Eight-year-old James Collins saved up his birthday money to buy the new United home shirt as soon as it hit shops last month. And he even paid to have the name of his idol Januzaj printed on the back and his squad number, 44, on the shorts. Scroll down for video . Devastated: James Collins, left, spent £93.20  on a shirt with the name of his favourite Manchester United player Adnan Januzaj, right, his number 44 when the new kit went on sale. But a month later, he swapped to 11 . But just a few weeks later, the young Belgian winger switched to number 11. The number was left vacant after Ryan Giggs' retirement at the end of last season. However, the club did not inform supporters of the planned change until Sunday, August 17 - exactly a month after the new home shirt had been released. Januzaj has played under number 44 for three years after joining the club as a 16-year-old. His young fan James has now refused to wear the Nike strip, which cost him £93.20 in total, fearing he may be teased about it. And despite pleas from his mother Cheryl, the club's Megastore have told him can't have a new shirt, as any printing is done at the shirt owner's risk. Mrs Collins, 45, has now hit out at the club saying they have let the boy down. The mother-of-three, who lives in Longsight, Greater Manchester, said: 'He's United mad. He has spent all summer at football camp and it's all he ever talks about. Dream dashed: James had spent months waiting to get his hands on the new kit but he says it is now 'ruined' 'He couldn't wait to get the new shirt and kept asking when I was ordering it. 'He'd only worn it two or three times when we found out he [Januzaj] had changed number. 'We emailed and asked them if he could change it and they said no because there was a disclaimer with all printing. 'A few weeks ago the club replaced a shirt where someone had spelt Rooney wrong. That was their error. 'Yet we have done nothing wrong and have been left out of pocket. If we had any idea it was going to change I would have made him wait rather than see him disappointed.' Last-minute change: Januzaj joined the club at 16 in 2011 and played under the number 44 until this summer . A short-sleeved home shirt from the Manchester United Megastore costs £42. But additional lettering costs £9.95. Mrs Collins also bought shorts, priced at £20, with an additional cost of £6 to print the number 44. And socks, which cost £12. She says the system needs to change as James is 'devastated'. 'James wanted the third kit as well but I've put a stop to that now. I'm not going to let him spend money on a shirt that could be out of date straight away.' However, a spokesman for the club insisted that notices were prominently displayed throughout the store making clear that squad numbers were not final until they are registered with the Premier League.","James Collins, 8, spent £93.20 saved from birthday money on new kit .

"By . Australian Associated Press . A doctor has been ordered to apologise to the family of a New Zealand woman who died after he 'completely forgot' to tell her she had breast cancer. The woman died earlier this year after a five-year battle with breast cancer which her GP failed to diagnose quickly, despite being told by a specialist that she probably had the disease. In a scathing report released by New Zealand's Health and Disability Commissioner Anthony Hill on Monday, the GP was told to review his practice and audit his clinical files to ensure he didn't miss more cancer cases involving other patients. A New Zealand woman died earlier this year after a five year battle with breast cancer after her doctor failed to diagnose it quickly enough, despite being warned by a specialist radiologist . The woman, who had breast cancer treatment in 2003, went to the unidentified medical centre in November 2009 complaining of pain in her left shoulder. The doctor, who was aware she was a cancer survivor, referred her for an x-ray which a specialist radiologist said revealed a tendon tear that appeared 'highly suggestive of metastasis', or the spread of cancerous lesions. New Zealand's Health and Disability Commissioner Anthony Hill told the GP to review his practice and audit his clinical files to ensure he didn't miss more cancer cases in a recent report of the incident . The GP saw the woman again several days later but failed to tell her about the cancer link, instead only informing her of the tendon tear and giving her a steroid injection which the woman said was 'excruciating'. She was told to return in a month if the pain persisted, which she did once in December and again in January before the doctor finally referred her to an orthopaedic surgeon. The woman was diagnosed in February 2010, after which she changed doctors. Despite several years of active treatment, the woman died. The doctor told the inquiry he 'either overlooked or completely forgot about the radiologist's comment in relation to a suspicious lesion', the report states. Mr Hill criticised the GP for failing to read his own notes, ask the right questions, or reflect on his patient's medical history when assessing her. 'Doctors owe patients a duty of care in handling patient test results, including advising patients of, and following up on, results,' he said. The GP has been referred to the Director of Proceedings for possible legal action.","The woman had sought treatment from the doctor complaining of a pain in her shoulder .

"By . Chris Kitching . An in-flight magazine is warning travellers to leave their copies of George Orwell’s classic novel 1984 at home if they visit Thailand. Twitter users have been circulating a photo of the article – apparently found in a Philippines Airlines magazine – which advises visitors how they can ‘blend in’ and avoid trouble as Thailand remains under strict military rule. The article warns: ‘Don’t carry George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984.” You don’t want to be mistaken for “an anti-coup protester.”’ Published in 1949, Orwell’s influential novel about life in a totalitarian surveillance state has reportedly been banned in Thailand, where it has become a symbol of political protest against a repressive military regime that seized power in a bloodless coup in May. Anti-coup protesters have staged silent readings as an act of resistance against the military junta and there has been at least one arrest. In June, a man was dragged away by half a dozen undercover police officers while reading 1984 outside an upscale shopping mall in Bangkok, the Associated Press reported. Big Brother: The novel about life in a totalitarian surveillance state has reportedly been banned in Thailand . The in-flight magazine lists five tips for visitors to Thailand, including the warning about 1984. The article encouraged travellers to carry their passports at all times, avoid wearing red T-shirts that are associated with anti-coup protesters, ask for permission before snapping a selfie with a soldier and avoid getting into debates about the pros and cons of the coup. The article reads: ‘Despite being under military control, Thailand is very safe for tourists.’ Philippines Airlines offers twice daily service between Manila and Bangkok. Twitter users have been circulating a photo of the article, purportedly from a Philippines Airlines magazine . The Foreign & Commonwealth Office makes no mention of the book in its travel advisory for Thailand, but it carries this warning for holidaymakers: ‘It’s illegal to criticise the coup and you should be wary of making political statements in public. You should monitor local news and social media for developments. ‘Over recent months there have been large-scale planned demonstrations, and spontaneous protests, in Bangkok and other cities. Some of these have turned violent. You should avoid any protests, political gatherings, demonstrations or marches.’ Over 800,000 British nationals visit Thailand every year, according to the FCO.","Philippines Airlines magazine article advises visitors how they can 'blend in'

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . Isn't the English language marvellous? Some wouldn't say so, but for 20 years traditional British words have slowly been replaced by Americanisms. And now, words like 'marvellous' have been usurped by the US cliché: 'awesome'. Not keeping to the book? Britons are gradually abandoning traditional words for Americanisms like 'awesome' The gradual change, charted by researchers at Cambridge University and Lancaster University, has also seen the decline of 'cheerio', 'pussy cat', 'marmalade' and 'fortnight', which are now barely used by anglophones. While in the 1990s we were captivated by 'Walkmans', today it has been replaced by the likes of 'online' and 'smartphone'. Other words like 'catalogue' and 'drawers', which were also regulars of the 1990s, have had to make way for 21st century sayings like 'Facebook', 'internet', 'Google', 'essentially' and 'treadmill'. Figures show that in 2014 the word 'awesome' appears 72 times per million words compared to 'marvellous', which has fallen in use from 155 times per million 20 years ago to only two times per million today. Researchers believe the digital revolution and America's growing influence on our culture have dramatically changed the way British people speak. Decline: Words like 'fortnight', 'cheerio', and 'pussy cat' are also on their way out of general speech . Language expert Professor Tony McEnery, from the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS) at Lancaster University, said: 'These very early findings suggest the things that are most important to British society are indeed reflected in the amount we talk about them. 'New technologies like Facebook have really captured our attention, to the extent that, if we're not using it, we're probably talking about it. 'The rise of 'awesome' seems to provide evidence of American English's influence on British speakers.' These are only the initial findings from a small pilot of the project, named the 'Spoken British National Corpus 2014', which is now underway. Prof McEnery said: 'We need to gather hundreds, if not thousands, of conversations to create a spoken corpus so we can continue to analyse the way language has changed over the last 20 years. 'We are calling for people to send us MP3 files of their everyday, informal conversations in exchange for a small payment to help me and my team to delve deeper into spoken language.' It is an ambitious project. Prof McEnery said: 'It has not been completed to this scale in the UK since the early 1990s. 'That data, which is now out of date, is still used by researchers from around the world today, so we know there is a real appetite for research of this kind. 'It is of great importance to collect new recordings from the 2010s in order to understand the nature of British English speech as it is today and not how it was more than two decades ago.' Using the 'Spoken British National Corpus 2014', the team at Lancaster University and Cambridge University Press will be able to shed light on the way our spoken language changes over time. The research also allows analysis into language used in different regions, between genders and across different age groups. Fortnight. The word 'fortnight' appears to have declined between the 1990s and . 2010s. Instead, the phrase 'two weeks' is much more popular now than it was . in the 1990s, and serves a similar function. Perhaps 'fortnight' is . nowadays perceived as slightly vaguer than two weeks - perhaps there is a . need to be more specific about our arrangements these days, or in . accounts of things that have happened in the past. Poll. The word 'poll' refers almost exclusively to 'poll tax' in the 1990s . data, which shows how things that are important to us in society, at any . time, shape our language use. The difference is simply that 'poll tax' was replaced with another form of tax in the 1990s. Pussy . cat. In the 1990s data, almost half of the time people talked about . cats, they called them pussy cats. In the 2010s data, people appear to . talk about cats no less than previously. The difference is that the . modifier pussy has been dropped. One hypothesis, which I cannot verify, . is that the word pussy has become too strongly associated with sexual . terminology for people to feel comfortable using in other contexts. Cheerio. The . word 'cheerio' was used commonly as a parting phrase in the 1990s data. This word cannot be found in the data we have collected so far from the . 2010s. We expect elderly people to still use it but not youngsters. Essentially. The use of the word 'essentially' has risen dramatically between the . 1990s and 2010s. It appears to have broadened in meaning, being used in . contexts where you might otherwise expect the word really. Treadmill. This word does not occur in the 1990s data. Without further analysis it . is hard to make any conclusions, but it could be part of a wider trend . of increased health awareness in society.","Americanisms like 'awesome' have replaced the English word marvellous .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . A child care woman charged with killing a toddler in her home told police she threw the boy to the floor and stepped on him three times to 'toughen him up', and after that he could no longer walk on his own, authorities said. Athena Skeeter, 40, was arraigned Sunday on charges of manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. The city's Administration for Children's Services did not immediately respond to a message seeking information on Skeeter, whom police said was a licensed child care worker. Death: Cardell Williamson (pictured) was allegedly beaten to death by Athena Skeeter one week ago . Child care: Athena Skeeter appeared in court Sunday as she was arraigned in the death of toddler Cardell Williamson, who she told police she stomped on three times while babysitting on Friday . According to a court document, Skeeter told police she had been wrestling Friday with 20-month-old Cardell Williamson at her Bronx home after his father dropped him off that morning. She said the child was on the bed when she lifted him by one arm and one leg and put him on the floor. She told police she stepped on his stomach but 'didn't use full force'. Skeeter said she then put her son on top of Cardell and stepped on his stomach. 'Cardell acted different after that,' Skeeter said, according to the court document. He threw up. His head kept tilting.' She said she put him in a bathtub and put cold water on his face, and then stepped out for a short time. When she came back, Streeter told police, Cardell's head was in the water and steam was coming up. He had burns on his face when police arrived. Police responding to a 911 call found Cardell lying on a bed, struggling to breathe. They rushed him to Bronx Lebanon Hospital in their squad car but it was too late. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. Warning signs: Cardell's father Carlyle Williamson said his son had come home with injuries before but said he thought it was just normal child accidents . Scene of the tragedy: Pictured above, the Bronx apartment where little Cardell was killed last week . Skeeter was in custody and is due back in court Thursday. No attorney information was available for her. The boy's father Carlyle Williamson told NY1 that his toddler had come home with bruises and a split lip before, but 'I expected that for a little boy 1 years old always climbing on stuff'. 'He's a happy little boy. He's outgoing, very friendly,' Mr Williamson said. 'He's a loving child. He's my heart, my last son, and I'm sorry I lost him. There's not too much I can say, you know.

As commuters returning to work after the Christmas and New Year break are hit by another punishing round of fare rises, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is preparing to pay train companies to do away with first class seats that are left empty, government sources say. End of the line: Empty seats on a first class Great Western carriage travelling from London. Ministers are considering asking train companies to convert them for use by standard ticket holders . From next month, as a declaration of intent, one operator is expected to be told to remove at least one first class carriage from each high-speed train in its premier fleet and replace it with a standard class alternative. Mr McLoughlin is negotiating changes to the franchise agreement with First Great Western, whose trains connect London to the South West of England, South Wales and the Thames Valley, to effect the move. He is understood to have authorised millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to help compensate the company for making the conversions. Typically, a nine-carriage train will provide 101 first class and 526 standard class seats. In 2010, all ten of the most overcrowded rail services in the country were provided by First Great Western. Rail minister Stephen Hammond today confirmed the option was being considered with the government in negotiations with a number of train companies about a number of ideas. He added: 'There are some new ideas we are looking at. This is one of them. Is it going to happen? It may. It may not.' Standard class: Commuters packed in on the 07.44 Great Western train from Henley on Thames to Paddington . The move has emerged on the day passengers face the annual rise in fares, with annual season tickets rising by an average of 3.1 per cent. The increase pushes some commuters into the £5,000-a-year club, with annual season tickets to London from Deal and Dover Priory in Kent costing £5,012. But despite the cost of a ticket, many commuters struggle to find a seat and are forced to stand. Operators admit that first class carriages are rarely more than two-thirds occupied, though they are reluctant to get rid of them of their own volition because of the premium they make on tickets. Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin is understood to be negotiating changes to the franchise agreement with First Great Western regarding first class carriages . Typically, a first class carriage has 50 seats, 35 fewer than in standard carriages. 'We know that this is something that annoys travellers and we want to do more to address the balance between first and standard class carriages' Government source . Commuters packed like sardines into standard class carriages often complain bitterly when they see empty first class accommodation. ‘We know that this is something that annoys travellers and we want to do more to address the balance between first and standard class carriages,’ said a senior government source. The contractual reform expected to begin next month with First Great Western and take effect over the next two years will affect all but sleeper services and a small number of smaller trains. Travelling first class: The Queen waits for a First Capital Connect train to depart from Kings Cross Station in London to Kings Lynn in December 2009 . End of an era? Bowlers and brollies for the first class commuters on a British railways train in 1965 . Other options are being considered to address an increasing capacity crunch on the creaking Victorian rail network. One idea is to introduce a new intermediate class, modelled on the premium economy seats offered by many airlines. Ministers are, however, concerned that it will mean standard class being seen as third class, which was phased out half a century ago. Mary Creagh, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, insists that the party will resist the Government ‘rolling out the budget airline model across our railways’. The Institute for Economic Affairs, a think tank, proposed in a recent report that standing-room only carriages should be introduced at the front of commuter trains on busy routes, offering tickets at about a fifth less than the standard class fare. Ministers have dismissed that idea as unacceptable. All three main parties are increasingly concerned to capture the rail commuter vote. Research for the Campaign for Better Transport has revealed that half of marginal constituencies contain large numbers of rail commuters, with the majority being Conservative held. Successive governments have raised rail fares by above inflation. With incomes under pressure, transport has become the biggest single outgoing for the average household – more than mortgage repayments and food. According to an analysis by the TUC’s and rail unions’ Action for Rail campaign published today, UK commuters spend over three times more of their salary on rail fares than most European passengers.","First class carriages will become a rarity as a result of the move .

The massive section of cliff collapsed on to Sidmouth beach, causing a huge cloud of red dust, covering daytrippers. It was caught on camera by Tony Lane, 60, from the New Forest, Hampshire, who said he heard pebbles falling to the ground before the landslide at 5pm on Wednesday. Landslide! Tourists move to safety on Sidmouth beach in Devon after part of the cliff comes crashing down . The area on the Devon coast is prone to landslides, with residents worrying their homes will be at risk. It also included trees from what is believed to be a household garden. The most recent collapse comes after a man died as a result of a cliff fall in the area in 2012. Mr Lane, a youth worker, said: ‘There was the sound of pebbles falling, then a few more pebbles and then a few seconds later some rocks started to come down. Crashing down: The rocks fell to the ground at Sidmouth beach, causing a cloud of red dust . ‘I sensed something was about to happen and just started to snap away. ‘Then there was a loud rumbling and a huge section of the cliff just gave way and went crashing to the beach. ‘A great cloud of dust rose up - people were just standing there watching in shock. ‘I'd say the nearest person could only have been 100 yards away. ‘The area covered by the landslide was pretty big. Police have urged tourist to avoid the east end of the beach - where a man was killed by a cliff fall in 2012 . ‘If anyone had been nearer it there would have been no chance - they wouldn't have escaped - there must have been thousands of tonnes of rock.’ He added there were some trees from part of a household garden among the cliff fall. ‘Some small trees which were part of someone's garden came away I think,’ Mr Lane added. ‘There was a big scallop out of the cliff afterwards.’ Holidaymakers hide as 'thousands of tonnes' of rubble comes crashing down on Sidmouth beach .

"By . Ryan Gorman . An anti-abortion movement appeared to encourage the kidnapping of women bound for abortion clinics before quickly backtracking amid a torrent of complaints. First posted to Facebook on Abolish Human Abortion’s Facebook page by  ‘Praying for you,’ the message encouraging volunteers to kidnap abortion-ready women went viral and has forced the activist group to distance itself from the comments. The post encouraged people to volunteer for shuttles meant to take women safely to and from abortion doctors, and to preach to them and drop them off at churches instead of clinics. Damage control: Abolish Human Abortion scrambled to distance itself from the suggestion, but made sure to sling some mud while doing so . The post asked people to share an email address being used by pro-choice group Cicada Collective for volunteers to sign up as shuttle drivers in Texas. ‘I’m not suggesting you actually take a woman to an abortion clinic,’ the post reads, ‘but it’s a wonderful opportunity to  minister to an abortion-minded woman for an hour while you DON’T take her to her clinic.’ ‘Even if you can’t change her mind by the time she gets out of your car and realizes she is at a church and not the clinic, she’s missed her appointment anyway,’ the post continues. MailOnline was not able to reach the Cicada Collective for comment, the group has not spoken publicly about the online posting. The shocking suggestion has been sent around the world and back many times by pro-choice groups warning Texans about possible kidnappings. The @FundTexasWomen twitter account tweeted a screen grab of the post with the caption ‘This really alarmed us this morning, just one reminder that getting an abortion in Texas can be very dangerous.’ The posting has stretched from Facebook and Twitter to Tublr and beyond, the DailyDot noted.One response to a Tublr post showing the inflammatory message suggests that such action could be considered a felony in the Lone Star State. Very active: AHA routinely protests outside of abortion clinics . The post has been deleted from AHA’s Facebook page, but a screen grab of the message was reposted and received a flood of negative comments. ‘Y'all know this is kidnapping, right?’ Wrote the person who re-posted it. ‘That's a felony, and since it's pre-meditated, have fun in prison.’ The group immediately backed down from the message, but not without a fight. ‘’Yes we deny that we support it. Kidnapping and abortion are wrong for the same reasons, they both violate the inherent rights and dignity of other human beings.’ AHA’s comparison of abortion to kidnapping only further fanned the flames. ‘We just hate you,’ one person responded. ‘ Sorry to hear you're so full of hate,’ the group responded to a negative comment. ‘Not surprising considering you advocate murder. We love you anyway though.’ After a lengthy back and forth during which AHA accused the grab’s poster of slander and libel and even mocked her usage of ‘y’all,’ the poster suggested the group ‘lawyer up and sue’ her. Peaceful resistance: The group preaches not to incite violence against people on either side of the abortion debate . The group does not appear ready to take her to court, and instead put out an entirely separate post accusing Praying for You of being ‘a fake group created by some pro-abortion rights people who are seeking to create a false story to cast aspersions on anti-abortion activists.’ This did little to stem the negative tide, but once again the group aggressively attacked the intelligence of those against it. ‘The lack of intellectual integrity some of you are demonstrating the last few days is truly astonishing,’ AHA said in a comment. The amount of negative publicity and vitriol directed at AHA has failed to prove one thing, any link the group actually has to an organized kidnapping effort. Texas officials have not reported any abortion-related kidnappings.","The original post was made to pro-life group Abolish Human Abortion's Facebook page by a third-party .

In July of 2009, an inert grenade was discovered inside a stuffed penguin at the Manchester - Boston Regional Airport . Officers discovered the assortment of guns and knives as they screened 638,705,790 passengers at airports across the US.

"By . Connie Allfrey . Johnny Cash's boyhood home is set to open its doors to the public on August 16, attracting up to 50,000 tourists a year. Music aficionados already flock to the Dyess area of Arkansas to commemorate the Man in Black's death - even though there are few restaurants or country music dives to quench the thirst with a legal beer. Now as part of a £3.3million project, the musician's simple clapboard home will welcome fans and give a glimpse into the star's childhood, which was spent with his family cultivating a small plot of land. Cash's modest five bedroom family home is soon to open for tours - expecting 30,000-50,000 visitors annually . The  five-room farmhouse has been restored to look just as it did, with new furniture conjured up from old photographs and diaries. The new tours are expected to boost tourism in the area, bringing in around £6million to the local economy. 'So, that, for Arkansas, is quite significant' said Ruth Hawkins, head of Arkansas State University's Heritage Sites program and at the helm of the project. Hidden away at the eastern edge of the state, the small town of Dyess is where Cash spent most of his formative years  until he joined the US Air Force in 1950. Now, there are high hopes that the little farmstead – which sits at the end of a dirt track on the edge of town, at 4791 West County Road – can become as famous a tourist site as the onetime address of another American musical legend, Elvis Presley. Presley’s flamboyant Graceland mansion sits just 50 miles from Dyess, across the River Mississippi and the Tennessee state line, in Memphis. It attracts 600,000 visitors every year – and tourism officials in Arkansas are optimistic that the Cash family homestead can share in some of the passing trade. The Delta's desolation inspired many of Cash's songs such as 'Five Feet High and Rising' about the 1937 flood . The ambitious restoration goes beyond providing a glimpse into the childhood of a musical sensation, providing also an idea of how a typical colony family lived at that time. The Cash family, with three-year-old Johnny in tow, moved to Dyess in 1935 as part of an experiment in which five hundred families were selected to settle in modest houses and cultivate 20-40 acres of swamp and forest. 'You came and you  worked the land. When the land became productive and you began to make some money off it, then you paid the government back with the idea of eventually owning your own land' Hawkins told St Louis Post-Dispatch. Cash's eldest daughter, the writer Rosanne Cash says of the poor Cash family: 'I don't think they would have survived without the WPA (Work Process Administration) project. There were 500 cottages, the administration building where my grandpa sold the cotton he picked and the co-op, the movie theater, the cafe and the school.' The Man in Black: Johnny Cash and wife, singer June Carter Cash, in Kensington in 1968 . The museum will educate about a significant part of American History, illuminating the origin of some of Cash's heartfelt songs like 'Five Feet High and Rising' about the catastrophic 1937 flood and 'Pickin' Time' on the back-breaking cotton picking process in Dyess. The eagerly anticipated opening follows in the wake of the fourth annual Johnny Cash Music Festival with headliners Reba McEntire, Bobby Bare and Loretta Lynn - initially started as a fundraiser for the project. Transforming the colony's theatre, now just a shell, into a tourist orientation centre, and building a caretaker home are intended as later phases to the venture. Family, community and helping others in times of hardship and need are recurring themes in Cash's lifelong body of work - highlighting principles which are still important in the Delta today. What must have been a memorable jamming session! Cash joins Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis . The project is hoping to raise the fortunes of the Dyess, where money is still scarce and much of the village has fallen into decline, with agriculture and numbers dwindling. The Delta's desolation, however, does appear to have contributed greatly to the music of Cash, Albert King and B.B.King - spurring them on to find a way out of the heat and the hard work and proving perhaps that necessity is the mother of all invention. A new museum dedicated to the life of Johnny Cash is set to open in Nashville later this year. The new museum will be situated on Nashville's main strip, Lower Broadway, 'right in the middle of the hubbub,' explained Cash's son John Carter Cash. Rosanne Cash said of Bill Miller, the collector of Johnny Cash memorabilia who is behind the project: 'He's been an incredible supporter of my dad and one of the largest collectors of memorabilia.' 'If anybody has the whole structure to put up a museum, he does. So I have a lot of trust in him and I think it's great at this point. I think he'll do something with dignity and class that's historically important, not some kitschy thing. I'm very interested in seeing what he does.'","Music legend's tiny boyhood farm to inject £6m a year into local economy .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . On a patch of hilly, barren scrubland in north-east Syria, kidnapped US journalist James Foley was beheaded by an Islamic State jihadist with an English accent. A chilling video, broadcast online, offered virtually no clues as to the location except that the extremist was based in the town of Raqqa. In an extraordinary piece of detective work, 35-year-old Eliot Higgins, who has investigated the Syrian conflict, may have pinpointed the spot where the reporter was killed. Mr Higgins explains there are two breaks in the rocks visible here either side of Mr Foley and his captor . According to Mr Higgins' analysis, this is the layout of the area in which Mr Foley was killed . The video showing the killing of Mr Foley is believed to have been filmed somewhere near Raqqa . But Mr Higgins, who blogs under the name Brown Moses, is not working for the security services… he is a Leicester-based citizen journalist who used just satellite imagery, traditional maps and evidence from the video to narrow down the place of death. Even though Mr Higgins admits there is ‘not a great deal of information’ in the video he points out some information can be gleaned. The killing was filmed in what appears to be a hilly area, with barely any plants or grass, and in the distance there is green plain below the hills. Shadows on the video suggest it was filmed in the morning, with the camera pointing northwards – suggesting the location was in the uplands south of Raqqa. Studying the video, the blogger surmised it was filmed on an area of raised ground, close to a dusty a track and leading to a break in the rocks, to the left of Mr Foley as the camera looks at him. There is another small break in the rocks to the right. In the distance there appear to be no obvious structures beyond what may be trees or small individual buildings. Trees at the top of this map correspond to the details spotted in the video filmed by Mr Foley's captors . These images show roads that help identify the location in the background of the video . Satellite map images appear to support Mr Higgins: they show a track entrance to the area, with a rock outcrop be partly covering the entryway, as it does in the video. Based on that information it appears that this is the approximate positions of what is seen in the video. The blogger also notes that when the camera films from a certain location on the outcrop, trees are visible in the distance - a possible match to the trees on the road running to the north-west. No buildings can be seen. Mr Higgins said: ‘Having reviewed locations along the hills south of Raqqa this appears to be the only location which fits what little information is available in the video. ‘Along the hills this appears to be the most isolated spot with any sort of road access, with most other areas with road access appearing to have structures that would be visible in the video. ‘Based on all available information we can say that at the very minimum the James Foley video was filmed in the hills south of Raqqa, and likely at the location shown above, supporting the claims that Raqqa is the possible location of the remaining hostages.’","Citizen journalist may have pinpointed the location U.S. journalist was killed .

"By . Chris Kitching . Russia is scrambling to bring home nearly 16,000 tourists who are still stranded abroad following a travel company's abrupt collapse amid economic strains related to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Oleg Safonov, the acting head of Rostourism, Russia's national tourism agency, told journalists that officials are hoping to have everyone home by the end of the week. At one point, as many as 27,000 tourists were thought to be marooned in places such as Bulgaria, Egypt and Tunisia after the Labirint (Labyrinth) travel company suspended operations over the weekend. Russian tourists have been stranded in Bulgaria and other holiday hotspots after four operators went bust . Russian officials have managed to bring a third of them home after making emergency arrangements but thousands more are still waiting for return tickets. Labirint is the fourth Russian tour operator to fold in the past three weeks, leaving more than 50,000 tourists stranded, as the industry suffers during one of the busiest travel periods of the year. Citing a drop in customer demand, Labirint blamed its troubles on 'the negative political and economic situation' and the sliding value of the rouble. The company had amassed a debt of nearly £23million owed to a subsidiary of Aeroflot, tourism officials said. The EU-US sanctions have already led to the grounding of budget airline Dobrolet, an offshoot of Aeroflot, and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev is threatening to retaliate. Vedomosti, a Russian language business daily, reported that Russia may restrict or ban European airlines from flying over Siberia on Asian routes. Russian budget airline Dobrolet, a subsidiary of Aeroflot, has suspended flights because of EU sanctions . After losing their way home, dozens of Russian tourists have reportedly been kicked out of their hotel rooms in Turkey. Turkey's Dogan news agency reported that 44 tourists, including 13 children, have been sleeping at the airport in the city of Antalya because they cannot afford return tickets. The group staged a protest and 'begged' for money to pay for their flights home, the news agency reported. Russia's NTV channel aired video of Russian tourists throwing furniture and fighting with security guards after being kicked out of a Turkish hotel where they had paid for an all-inclusive holiday. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has compared tour companies to 'pyramid schemes' In Greece, another popular destination for Russian holidaymakers, the Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises is encouraging hoteliers to allow Russian customers to remain in their rooms. Rostourism, meanwhile, is threatening to create a blacklist of hotels that mistreat Russian tourists. The agency says its unofficial data suggests the number of Russians travelling abroad has dropped between 15 and 30 per cent, depending on destination, and the number of foreign tourists visiting Russia is down by as much as a fifth from last year. Medvedev compared the tour operators to 'pyramid schemes' and ordered authorities to monitor their finances and close the ones without sufficient reserves. Authorities are investigating Labirint and Neva, another tour company, for possible fraud.","As many as 27,000 tourists were marooned after Labirint abruptly folded .

"By . Associated Press . Jan Harding (left) nearly died after ingesting a lye-laced iced tea earlier this month. However, she made a miraculous recovery and was released from the hospital on Saturday . A Utah woman who nearly died after unknowingly drinking iced tea mixed with chemicals has been released from a Salt Lake City hospital. Jan Harding, 67, was released Saturday morning, University of Utah Health Care spokeswoman Marissa Villasenor said Sunday. Harding is now recovering at home after making progress during the last week that is 'nothing short of miraculous,' family attorney Paxton Guymon said in an email Sunday. Harding must still undergo tests and procedures to determine any long-term complications, Guymon said. 'The family sincerely appreciates all of the support and prayers from everyone who has followed her story,' he said. Harding has been slowly improving since August 10, when she drank a single sip of sweetened iced tea at Dickey's Barbecue in South Jordan, a Salt Lake City suburb. An industrial cleaning solution mixed into the tea caused deep, ulcerated burns in Harding's esophagus. On Thursday, her husband, Jim Harding, told reporters that his wife has had nightmares about the moment that made her say, 'I think I drank acid.' Jim Harding, 66, said he's focused on his wife's recovery and not criminal charges or lawsuits. Salt Lake County prosecutors are reviewing a police investigation and have not announced if charges will be filed. Authorities have said a restaurant employee unintentionally put the heavy-duty cleaner lye in a sugar bag, and another worker mistakenly mixed it into the iced tea dispenser. Lye, which looks like sugar, is an odorless chemical used for degreasing deep fryers. Harding's husband Jim spoke at a press conference last week, to give an update about his wife's condition . This file photo shows the exterior of the Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan, Utah where the incident happened . Jan Harding was the first one to drink from the chemically laced batch of tea, and no one else was harmed. The Dallas-based Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has said the incident was isolated and unprecedented in the chain's 73-year history. After investigating, Guyman said last week that had discovered another lye incident at the South Jordan restaurant in July. An employee at the South Jordan restaurant burned herself when she stuck her finger in a sugar container and licked it to test for the chemical cleaner, he said. The employee's tongue began bleeding and blistering. She quit on August 9, the day before Harding was burned, Guymon said. Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants has not commented on the new allegations.","Jan Harding, 67, almost died after drinking iced tea mixed cleaning-compound lye .

"By . Chris Kitching . A careless baggage handler has been caught on camera kicking and throwing luggage at an airport in south-western Russia. Angry passengers watched from their seats as the employee, standing alone on a vehicle used to transport luggage, casually slammed the bags on top of each other. A passenger recorded the nearly two-minute video on his mobile phone while the man and off-screen co-workers unloaded bags from a plane at Volgograd International Airport. The rough employee, who appears disgruntled and is clearly not concerned about the fragility of the passengers’ belongings, was filmed flinging bags of all sizes by their straps or handles. At one point, the video shows him grabbing two bags and tossing them onto the pile behind him without looking back to see where they landed. Another moment shows a large suitcase sliding between the man's legs after it was given a push by an off-screen colleague. He doesn't seem to care that he is being watched by the plane's occupants while he manhandles their luggage.

"By . Connie Allfrey . Ever found the notes returned from an airport currency deal a bit thin on the ground? A new report revealed yesterday that UK holidaymakers are losing almost £20m a year in spending money by choosing to buy a foreign currency last minute in the airport. The Holiday Confidence Index reveals that the number of travellers who wait until they are at the airport to change their money has doubled to four per cent, despite airport currency rates being universally more costly. Last minute currency exchanges save time but not money: UK travellers lose £20m a year in airport deals . Sun-seekers heading for the beaches of Spain or Greece can be £25 poorer from an average transaction of £360 when buying euros at an airport Bureau de Change. And holidaymakers heading to the US can be $40 down, while travellers booked to fly Down Under are AU$50 dollars poorer. The study by Debenhams found the rates offered at airports over a week seven per cent lower over a week, when compared with buying in advance on the High Street. Headed to a Spanish beach? Change money in advance and save 25 pounds to pay for a meal in most resorts . With an estimated 850,000 travellers obtaining currency just before they fly - that's a potential substantial saving which would pay for a meal of two in most resorts. 'People quite rightly spend weeks preparing for their holiday, comparing the cost of flights and accommodation to get the best value, but many forget about the cash they need when they reach their destination'' said Director of Debenhams Personal Finance, Mike Hazel. 'Leaving it to the last minute really is a bad choice if you are looking to get the most from your hard-earned pounds.' High Street best for foreign currency rates: Debenhams adds 15 new travel money bureaus in next two months . And it seems confidence is up among British travellers this year. More than three-quarters of holidaymakers intend to take the same amount of currency or more on their travels as last year, according to the Holiday Confidence Index - compiled  by the Institute of Travel and Tourism, the University of Wolverhampton and pollster YouGov.","UK holidaymakers lose almost £20m a year in airport currency deals .

Officers saw the three couples in the throes of passion after they caught a motorist for dangerous driving at the checkpoint in the resort of Playa d'en Bossa. Scroll down for video . The Swiss tourists were discovered by police at the Ibiza party hotspot of Playa d'en Bossa . But instead of fining them for indecency, police fined the tourists £158 (200 euros) each for not wearing seatbelts. The group ended up paying on the spot once they had dressed so they could benefit from a 50 per cent discount. A local police spokesman said: 'Having sex in the back of a van isn't against the law but not wearing seatbelts is.

The sordid session was greeted with disgust around the world after the video was posted by a witness at the event. Successive investigations found holidaymakers from Britain and also the rest of Northern Europe behaving badly in resorts from Magaluf in Mallorca to San Antonio in Ibiza. As a result of the bad publicity in Magaluf, police have cracked down on pub crawls, saying that no more than 50 people can attend them.

"By . Stephen Johns for The Daily Mail . Navy Pilot: Prince Andrew, pictured in 1982, said he was 'foolish' to think he was invincible . The Duke of York has spoken about his fear of dying in the Falklands after he was shot at by Argentine forces. Prince Andrew said there were a ‘couple of times’ he feared not coming back home after carrying out dangerous missions while serving as a helicopter pilot. He joined the Royal Navy in 1979 and served for 22 years, including the Falklands War in 1982. Speaking to American television channel CNBC ahead of a charity initiative to help young entrepreneurs, he said he had been ‘very lucky’ to survive the conflict and admitted he had been ‘foolish’ to think he was ‘invincible’. He added: ‘If you’ve been through those sorts of experiences you understand the frailty of life. And it’s not particularly nice being shot at and I can attest to that. ‘You look at life in a different way and you try to achieve more. I was very lucky to come back without having been shot down. ‘I have to say that afterwards I thought I was completely invincible and if anybody wanted to do it again, absolutely bring it on. ‘But I’ve realised the error of my ways now and I think that’s more foolish.’ When asked if there was a moment he thought he might not come home, he said: ‘Yeah probably a couple of times. But that’s normal. ‘One was being shot at, one was being missed by a missile which didn’t actually really arrive because it already hit somebody and the other one was trying to identify a ship at night.’ He said becoming a helicopter pilot was a ‘logical choice’ because it posed the ‘greatest intellectual challenge’ possible in the military. Prince Andrew also talked about his good friendship with his former wife, Sarah, Duchess of York. He said their relationship meant a ‘whole heap’ to the family and their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Scroll down for video .

Plans to create a block of privately owned apartments on the site of the Gleneagles Hotel in Asheldon Road, Torquay, Devon have gone out to public consultation ahead of a planning application. The hotel and its former owner in the 1960s were reportedly the inspiration behind John Cleese's incredibly popular TV sitcom Fawlty Towers. The show is still being broadcast around the globe and continues to raise the profile of Torquay and has even been voted the top BBC sitcom by foreign viewers. English Riviera: The Gleneagles Hotel is reportedly the inspiration behind the hit show .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Market stall holders in Spain want to charge tourists they claim are hindering local buyers. Valencia's Central Market, one of the oldest European markets still running, is popular with foreigners who visit on guided tours. But food sellers say they are being overrun by the hordes of holidaymakers who often leave without buying anything after hogging up corridors to take photos. Buzzing: Nearly 400 small traders operate out of the beautiful Central Market in Valencia . Stall holders are now urging the council to try to find a solution - and say an entry fee for non-customers similar to the 50 cent (40 pence) charge for using the market toilets introduced earlier this year, could be an answer. Market traders' association Francisco Dasi said: 'We know the market is a public building everyone can access but we also want the council to know we're receiving more and more complaints from our members and something has to be done. 'Tourist who arrive in large groups can cause problems for our regular customers.

And it seems the majority of Britons feel that way as a TripAdvisor survey reveals 82 per cent of Brits name the seaside in the UK as their favourite childhood memory.

And the good news for the UK tourism industry is that more than half of Brits (57 per cent) named their favourite childhood holiday as a trip to the British seaside. The survey uncovered that, for most of us, childhood memories are associated with seaside sensations - the swooshing crash of the sea (37 per cent) and the sludge of wet sand between our toes (19 per cent) being the two most cited sensations. An overwhelming 82 per cent of Brits named a destination in the UK as their childhood treasure, with South West England holding the fondest holiday memories for a third (30 per cent), followed by the South East (14 per cent) and Wales (14 per cent). Boon for British Tourism!  82% of Brits surveyed named a UK destination as their treasured childhood holiday .

'But what is interesting is that when we do return we often find new things to fall in love with, which proves that it is worth taking the time to research new places to stay, eat and visit even if we're travelling somewhere familiar.' Nearly 90 per cent of Brits who have revisited their preferred childhood haunts in the last five years have not been disappointed; most wanted to share their childhood holiday spot with their partner and found it lived up to expectations. 46% of parents have taken their children to their own favourite holiday destination in the last five years .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Campaigners fighting for a French-owned beach to be reopened to the public have held a protest picnic in a bid to reclaim part of their beloved coastline. Around 300 people stormed the fence surrounding West Beach at Newhaven in Sussex today, which has been sealed off since 2007 because of 'absurd' health and safety. The group gathered as the low tide made way for the sand, before useing ladders to climb over the barricade. They then ran onto the beach to spread out Union Jack flags and write messages in the sand, including: 'Give us our surf beach back.' People young and hold who jumped the fence even scratched out messages in the sand with sticks . Around 300 people stormed the fence surrounding West Beach at Newhaven in Sussex, which has been sealed from tourists and residents since 2007 . The stretch of coast has been the subject of a ongoing legal battle with the French-controlled company Newhaven Port and Properties who claim it is not a sandy beach . The Court of Appeal has ruled the beach can be listed as a village green, giving residents the right to use it. But the French owners Newhaven Port and Properties is appealing against the ruling to the Supreme Court, and has said the beach remains closed for safety reasons. A final decision is set to be made during a hearing in November. Helen McLean, who runs the Facebook page We Love Newhaven and organises the annual demonstration, told Mail Online: 'This is the only sandy beach for miles. The South East coast is actually known for its hard, pebbly beaches. 'People still look to buy a house down here just because of the sandy beach, even though it is closed off. The locals stretch a Union Jack out across the French-owned beach as part of the annual protest . 'We initially told the council that the stairs, which have been there since around 1860, were rickety. They shut the beach and we thought they were doing maintenance, but it has remained closed ever since. 'It is a clean beach, because the tide completely covers it twice a day, and British families have been enjoying it for generations.' Newhaven Village Green Preservation Society organised the picnic - which included entertainment, banners and bunting. The group said campaigners young and old covered the gates to scale the barriers to retake the beach. In recent years, the gates have been vandalised, allowing residents to use the beach, but the action has not prompted the French firm to change their mind. Police were at the scene casting a 'passing eye' on the demonstrator's behaviour, but no arrests were made . Objects were passed through the gaps in the barricade while others used ladders to jump over the top . Even children were carried over the metal fence to join in the picnic at the once-popular tourist beach - which has been used by British residents for around 150 years .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . New regulations from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) allowing Australian domestic airline passengers to use electronic devices from gate-to-gate are soon to be approved. CASA's call for revised submissions already has Australian airliners cheering, including Virgin and Qantas which began pursuing the changes long ago. The changes could see passengers able to use smartphones and tablets weighing up to 1 kilogram in flight mode during take-off, landing and taxi mode. Australian Airliners are awaiting approval from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to alter regulations allowing passengers to use hand held electronic devices during take-off and landing . Heavier items such as laptops will still be required to be held in overhead departments with fear they could be a danger to other passengers during high turbulence if they become air-borne. Airlines have to complete a safety checklist before the regulations can be approved, however, which will include detailing how they will ensure passengers do not use their devices in a disruptive way, according to the Herald Sun. They must also show their aircraft manufacturers approve of the change. Training for cabin crews will also have to be revised with necessity placed on ensuring passengers still pay attention to flight announcements. Virgin Australia wasted no time after the announcement, releasing a statement on Friday from the chief customer officer Mark Hassell which claimed that the airline company had already re-lodged their submission and were waiting for approval . 'In-flight entertainment is a key driver of customer satisfaction and this application marks the next phase of that product evolution,' Mr Hassell said. Virgin Australia had re-lodged their submission by Friday according to their chief customer officer, with the airline planning to implement the regulation change as soon as possible . 'Virgin Australia will work to immediately implement the use of hand-held personal electronic devices from gate to gate and will have further updates for customers in coming days.' A spokesperson for Qantas told the Herald Sun that as of July 16, passengers on Qantas flights across New Zealand and the US were already enjoying the perks. 'Qantas passengers travelling on the majority of trans-Tasman routes can already use personal electronic devices during all phases of flight provided the devices are in flight mode,' said a Qantas spokeswoman.","Australian domestic passengers could soon be able to use hand held electronics during take-off and landing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Omar Saeed Sheikh (pictured in 2002), who was convicted of the murder of reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002, has attempted to commit suicide in prison, police have said . A British man serving life imprisonment in Pakistan for the killing of American reporter Daniel Pearl has tried to commit suicide, police have said. Omar Saeed Sheikh was convicted in 2002 of the murder of Pearl, who was the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was kidnapped and beheaded in Pakistan. The 38-year-old reporter had been investigating militant groups when he was abducted in Karachi in January , 2002. On February 21, 2002, a shocking video of his killing was delivered to U.S. officials in Pakistan. His remains were found in a shallow grave on Karachi's outskirts three months later. British-Pakistani Sheikh, who attended Forest School in Snaresbrook, east London, and three others were arrested and convicted in June 2002. Sheikh has now tried to hang himself in prison, Senior police official Akram Naeem has told the AFP news agency. Mr Naeem said he was rescued after he was spotted by officials. He said: 'His condition is stable now and a case has been filed against him in the local police station.' In January 2011, a report by the Pearl Project at Georgetown University suggested the wrong men had been convicted of the murder. Daniel Pearl was abducted from Karachi while researching a story on militant groups - his body was found three months later . The investigation claimed the alleged mastermind behind 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, was responsible for the murder. Days before he was abducted, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy. Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture. Daniel Pearl's death was confirmed on February 21, 2002. There were outpourings of grief from political and religious leaders, along with ordinary people around the world, who had campaigned for his release. Three months later, Mariane gave birth to the couple's son Adam. Marianne Pearl wrote a memoir entitled A Mighty Heart about her late husband's life which was adapted into a film starring Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl and Dan Futterman as the journalist. Omar Saeed Sheikh and three others were arrested and convicted in connection with the murder of Pearl in June 2002 .","British-born Omar Saeed Sheikh convicted of Daniel Pearl's murder in 2002 .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Ministers have been condemned as ‘shameful’ and ‘devious’ after they blocked international efforts to ban plastic bags. David Cameron once claimed his government would be the ‘greenest ever’, and signed up to efforts to reduce the number of throwaway bags handed out at tills. But it has emerged that ministers have been secretly working behind the scenes in Brussels to kill off controls. Italy had brought in controls in 2011 after study found 73% of man-made waste on coast was plastic bags . UK blocked the ban citing EU law, despite the dangers plastic bags cause to wildlife in Britain and abroad . They have used the EU legal system to overturn the Italian government’s ban on thin plastic bags in their own country. In 2011, Italy brought in controls on plastic bags following studies which found that they made up 73 per cent of the man-made waste settling on the sea bed around its coast. But the UK claims this is illegal under European law. Its intervention has stopped the measure in its tracks – and prevented other European governments from adopting similar schemes. Britain’s decision has apparently put the commercial interests of plastic bag manufacturers ahead of the need to tackle litter, blight and harm to wildlife. It contradicts pledges made by Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg dating back to February 2008, when they offered their support to the Daily Mail’s ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign. Italian ministers and environmental campaigners are furious about the role played by the Government. Italy’s environment minister, Andrea Orlando, said: ‘The bags are a serious problem, above all at sea, and it is astounding that Britain, which is serious about the environment and has a seafaring tradition going back centuries, does not want to defend the seas from plastic pollution which suffocates and kills many marine animals.’ The Daily Mail campaigned against the use of plastic bags for five years and it was backed by Cameron and Clegg . Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, who at . one time was an adviser on green issues to the Prime Minister, condemned . the Government’s failure to tackle ‘plastic poison’ bags. He said: ‘It is bad enough that the Government’s rhetoric on this issue is miles away from any meaningful action, but using EU bureaucracy to stop other nations doing the right thing is just shameful. The sheer deviousness of this latest move will be surprising even to cynics amongst us.’ Dr Sue Kinsey, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: ‘It seems extraordinary that a government that has badged itself as the greenest ever should seek to stop a ban on carrier bags. ‘It seems hypocritical to agree on the one hand that something needs to be done to reduce the number of carrier bags given out in the UK and on the other to block a ban on bags in Italy.’ The department for environment, food and rural affairs, run by Tory secretary of state Owen Paterson, and the business department, run by Lib Dem Vince Cable, could not agree on who was responsible for blocking the ban. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, right, who once advised David Cameron, left, on green issues, condemned Government's failure to tackle 'plastic poison' bags . Marine Conservation Society called the Government 'hypocritical' for its stance on the Italian ban . Eight billion plastic bags are issued in the UK - more than six billion are used in England . Both claimed they were simply trying to uphold European packaging laws and protect the interests of UK manufacturers. A Government spokesman said: ‘While we are determined to tackle the blight . caused by discarded carrier bags, the proposed Italian scheme is illegal . under EU packaging laws.’ But many countries have introduced charges for bags in an attempt to cut down on their use. The Welsh government introduced a 5p charge on plastic bags in October 2011, reducing the number handed out at tills by 90 per cent and raising tens of thousands of pounds for good causes. Northern Ireland brought in its own 5p charge earlier this year, while the Scottish Parliament is expected to follow suit. Dr Kinsey said: ‘Although this block came from “Britain” or the “UK” I am sure that Wales and Northern Ireland – which already have bag levies and Scotland which is considering one – would not agree with this position. ‘Yet again England is left isolated on this issue as the only part of the UK not to be doing anything to reduce the number of bags. ‘Perhaps they should get their own house in order before interfering with others.’ Ministers have stood by while the number of plastic bags given out at tills in England has risen dramatically over the past two years. Currently, around eight billion single use bags are issued by stores across the UK each year. England accounts for 6.77billion of these. The majority end up in landfill where it is estimated they can take up to 1,000 years to rot away, while others are discarded to blight streets, seas and the countryside. Once in the environment, they are a threat to birds, dolphins, whales and turtles. The Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, launched in 2008, won the backing of politicians from all parties as well as countryside and clean-up groups. At the time, Marks & Spencer took the lead by introducing a 5p charge across the country, cutting billions of bags and raising cash to clean up green spaces and beaches. Earlier this year, leaders from Keep Britain Tidy, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Marine Conservation Society and Surfers Against Sewage met environment minister Lord de Mauley to call for action to introduce charges in England. But he brushed their concerns off, and promised no action beyond monitoring how the schemes work in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.","UK ministers used EU law to overturn Italian's ban on thin plastic bags .

"By . Ollie Gillman For Mailonline . Imagine logging into Facebook, writing a message about your favourite singer, actor or athlete and then them replying directly to you. Well that's exactly what has happened to some fans, with celebrities including Mariah Carey and Samuel L. Jackson using a new app on the social networking site to 'status bomb' users. Whoopi Goldberg even used the app to tell a critic why his opinion was wrong, serving him a hot slice of humble pie. Whoopi Goldberg crashed Dom Lane's Facebook status to remind him she had been in plenty of good films . Looking smug: Whoopi Goldberg is one of a growing number of celebs who have downloaded the Mentions app . The new Facebook Mentions app allows celebrities to see every time a user has put their name in a public post. Famous people who have verified pages will then be able to reply or like the post. The app was released in the US last month and is being rolled out across the world. The first celebrities have started to reply to their fans and, in the case of Whoopi Goldberg, their critics. Dom Hall did not expect a huge reaction when he posted a status about a film he had just seen. He said: 'Whoopi Goldberg - cool. Any film she's ever been in ever - not cool.' To his surprise, Whoopi wrote back: 'You are entitled to your opinion. But color purple is a great movie Long Walk Home I've made about 80. Have you seen them all? Lion king? [sic]' Mr Hall quickly ate his own words, replying: 'That'll teach me. Color Purple was epic. I'll get my coat...' We see you! The app allows celebrities to see when they are being talked about on Facebook . 'Love to your mom': Mariah Carey took the opportunity to say hello to a fan's mother through the app . Status bomb: Samuel L. Jackson told his fans he was still at a convention after he was mentioned in a post . The app is available for anyone with a verified account, and is being rolled out around the world . Mariah Carey joined in on the Mentions app after journalist Brian Anthony Hernandez interviewed and tagged her on Facebook, saying that the singer had said hello to his mother. The multi-platinum artist responded saying: 'Brian we see you dahhhling!! Ps love to your mom.' Thousands of people saw her comment and more than 200 people 'liked' it. Samuel L. Jackson is another celebrity who has downloaded the iPhone app, responding to a fan who saw him at Comic Con - a cartoon, films and games convention. John Austin posted a status saying: 'Day 3 at Comic Con International featuring The Little Mermaid, Sharknado and not Samuel Jackson!' The Snakes on a Plane actor replied: 'I'm still here m*********!' Other celebrities who have downloaded the app include singer Ed Sheeran and New Orleans Saints punter Thomas Morstead. The interaction between celebs and their fans has previously been reserved for Twitter, where users can message anybody unless they have a protected account. Previously Facebook users could use the '@' sign to mention a celebrity's page, but this was not easily searchable for the famous person. Facebook product manager Allison Swope said: 'Nearly 800 million people are connected to public figures on Facebook, and interacting with athletes, musicians, actors and other influencers is an important part of their experience. 'From cheering on World Cup players to checking out updates from favorite celebrities, there are more than a billion interactions between public figures and their fans on Facebook every week.

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . A grandmother got a nasty wake-up call when she found a dead mouse in her packet of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cornflakes. Pauline Henderson, 50, was pouring a bowl of newly-opened cereal for her grandson Toby when the rodent's body dropped into the bowl. She spotted it among the flakes and managed to stop the two-year-old from tucking in, but was left 'disgusted' by the stomach-churning find. Scroll down for video . The dead mouse Pauline Henderson found inside a box of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cornflakes . Ms Henderson, a security officer, fears she would have had to rush her grandson to hospital if he had eaten the mouse. She has complained to the Tesco supermarket in Portsmouth, Hants, where she bought the 1kg box of cereal. Ms Henderson, who has six grandchildren, said she loves having her grandson to stay and bought the cereal for him especially. After pouring out the cornflakes she noticed something 'black', so took a closer look. She said: 'I knew something wasn't right, so I got a spoon and gingerly moved the flakes out of the way. Ms Henderson, 50, was left 'disgusted' after finding the mouse when she poured her grandson a bowl of cereal . 'Then I saw the mouse. It was horrible and I felt absolutely sick.' Her grandson, Toby, was initially unaware of the find and was standing beside Ms Henderson saying 'cornies, cornies'. Ms Henderson added: 'Goodness knows how long the mouse was in the box or if it was dead or alive when it went in. 'I have put the box and the mouse in the freezer for now because I want environmental health or Kellogg's to come and look at it. 'It's put me off buying any Crunchy Nut ever again.' Ms Henderson said before discovering the rodent, the cereal was unopened and had been stored in a kitchen cupboard. She has since complained to the Tesco store where she bought the cereal, and has notified Environmental Health officials. Kellogg's are investigating how the mouse, seen here in the cereal bowl, came to be inside the packet and Tesco, where Ms Henderson purchased the cereal, said they would 'support' their supplier's investigation . Ms Henderson said her complaint to Tesco wasn't taken seriously: 'The first man that served me laughed and I thought 'It's not funny, do you see me laughing?' The store manager then asked her for a receipt for the purchase, but she couldn't find it. Ms Henderson added: 'I've been back since and all the cereal boxes are still on the shelves - but if one of them had a mouse any one of the others could too.' Tesco said it was 'concerned' by the incident. A spokesman said: 'We set ourselves the highest standards for the quality and safety of the food we sell and were concerned to hear of this. 'We would like to thank Ms Henderson for alerting us and we will work with the supplier to support their investigation.' Ms Henderson said she had also spoken to Kellogg's who had offered her a new box of cereal, which she declined. Kellogg's are investigating how the mouse came to be in the box, and said 'it hasn't happened before'. A spokesman added: 'We take food safety extremely seriously and carry out regular quality checks in our factories.'","Pauline Henderson was left 'disgusted' after finding the rodent in her cereal .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . After battling for almost an hour with his hands gripped to his rod and adrenaline pumping through his body, a British tourist has caught the world's biggest Siamese carp - weighing the same as a person. Andy Harman, from Reigate, Surrey, finally reeled in the whopping 10st 6lbs fish while on holiday in Thailand - after he had it on the line for an exhausting 50 minutes. The keen angler, who was holidaying at the idyllic three-acre Palm Tree Lagoon fishing resort in Ratchaburi, used the simple bait of bread to lure the mammoth fish in - followed by a huge amount of patience and muscle work. What a whopper! Andy Harman proudly holds his record 150lb Siamese carp at a Thai fishing resort . Give us a kiss! After landing the monster, Mr Harman released it safely back into the water . At 150lbs, the monster weighed in at 16lbs heavier than the previous record , which, strangely, was also caught by someone from Surrey on holiday in Thailand. Keith Williams, of Carshalton, got the perfect 56th birthday present when he caught a 134lb carp at Gillham's fishing resort in Krabi. Mr Harman told GoFishing.co.uk: 'It was eventually netted via a rectangular arapaima cage as it was too big for a landing net. 'It beat my previous Siamese carp best of 84lbs and although it is bigger than the current IGFA [International Game Fish Association] record I'm not going to be putting a claim in as I'm currently fishing for one believed to be even bigger  at another venue that to date has not been landed before.' World beater: The 150lb carp is 16lbs heavier than the previous Siamese carp record . Peek-a-boo: Mr Harman can barely see over the fish's giant body as he cradles his prize in his arms . After posing for a few obligatory photos with his prize, Mr Harman released the giant carp  safely back into the water. Mr Harman is the former winner of prestigious angling award the Drennan Cup, and is very used to tackling monstrous  - in 2012 he landed a 450lb arapaima from Bung Sam Ran Lake, also in Thailand. A former British barbel record holder, he now lives in Australia, and travels all over Thailand in search of the world's biggest catches. In 2011 he succeeded in catching Thailand's holy trinity of fish - a Siamese carp, a Mekong catfish and an arapaima - during a three-day excursion. Take the bait: The bread flake and method feeder used to lure in the whopper, before the 50-minute battle . Siamese carp are the largest species of carp, and are only found in the Mae Klong, Mekong and Chao Phraya river basins. They are among the largest freshwater fish in the world, and can weigh up to an enormous 660lbs, though it is believed none that large currently exist. They make a tasty meal, which means their numbers have declined rapidly. Because they are so popular for both food and fishing, they have been deliberately stocked in lakes for centuries, and are farmed all over Asia. The European world record carp weighed in at 101lb 4oz, and was reeled in in Hungary in 2012 by Austrian angler Roman Hanke. In Europe only common carp and mirror carp are counted as world record fish.","Andy Harman, from Reigate, Surrey, lands whopping 150lb Siamese carp .

"By . Andy Dolan for the Daily Mail . A disgraced former governor of a school linked to the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham is being sued over claims he barred staff brought in after an Ofsted inspection. Waseem Yaqub is alleged to have harassed staff appointed to turn the Al-Hijrah School around, according to a high court writ lodged by the city council for up to £100,000. The writ also accuses Mr Yaqub of intimidation and trespassing on the Bordesley Green school site after the council disbanded the governing body he headed in May. The school, Birmingham's only Islamic school, is for pupils aged four to 16 and was once one of the most sought after in the country. Scroll down for video . Waseem Yaqub, chairman of governors and member of the interim executive board at Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham, which was placed in special measures . But it was placed in special measures after Ofsted inspections found classroom standards were in decline. Al-Hijrah was also found to have a budget deficit of £889,000. An Interim Executive Board (IEB) was drafted in but, according to the writ, Mr Yaqub successfully thwarted the IEB's work – denying members access to the school and even using security guards to threaten and intimidate them. In June, the council won an injunction banning Mr Yaqub from the school after he repeatedly returned there despite his dismissal. But the IEB was twice blocked from entering the premises by protesters led by Mr Yaqub. The Labour-run council and the IEB, which have issued the writ, also claim Mr Yaqub wrote an email accusing the board of being a 'hit squad', undertaking a 'dawn raid'. Mr Yaqub was also of intimidation and trespassing on the Bordesley Green school site after the council disbanded the governing body he headed in May . The writ seeks damages of between £50,000 and £100,000, claiming Mr Yaqub was repeatedly abusive to three IEB members. No date has been fixed for the damages hearing. Al-Hijrah, a state-funded Muslim faith school, was not one of the 21 inspected by Ofsted in connection with the so-called Trojan Horse plot to oust secular heads and governors at state schools and force through strict Islamic principles. However, most of the individuals claimed to be key figures in the alleged plot have strong links to the Al-Hijrah Trust, the body which owns and, until May, ran the school. Tahir Alam, the plot's alleged ringleader, was secretary to the Al-Hijrah Trust and head of the Al-Hijrah Training Academy, which, according to its website, trains Muslim parents to 'empower the community to ensure our needs are met'. Mr Yaqub was seconded as a 'consultant' to Saltley School at the same time as its respected non-Muslim head teacher, Balwant Bains, was removed, though he denied any involvement. The chairman of governors at Saltley, Mohammed Ikhlaq, was then hired by Al-Hijrah as a 'leadership consultant' at a cost of £23,000. As well as seeking damages, the writ also seeks to ban Mr Yaqub from having any further involvement or contact with the school. Mr Yaqub has a seven-year-old child at the school. 'They are trying to ban me having a say in my child's education,' he said. 'That is an infringement of my right to a family life.' He branded the allegations in the writ 'spurious and false' and described the protest he led outside the school as peaceful. A council spokesman could not comment on ongoing legal matters.","Waseem Yaqub alleged to have harassed staff at the Al-Hijrah School .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A rape victim broke down in tears at a news conference yesterday as she recalled the moment a police officer told her 'women need to stop spreading their legs like peanut butter' when she complained that her attacker was allowed back on campus just two weeks after the assault. Kylie Angell, a nurse who graduated from the University of Connecticut  in May, said the school initially expelled her attacker, but . readmitted him two weeks later without informing her of that decision. She found out when he approached her in the cafeteria and stroked her arm. Angell and six other women who were victims of sexual assault while they were students there filed a federal discrimination complaint on Monday against the school, claiming it did not take measures to protect them or even properly investigate the incidents. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Emotional: Attorney Gloria Allred, second from left, looks toward former University of Connecticut student Kylie Angell, center, as she reads a statement at a news conference about how UConn treated her rape case . High-profile attorney Gloria Allred announced on Monday she is representing the students and filed the complaint to the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights on their behalf. 'They . are simply tired of seeing women being raped and sexually assaulted at . the university while the administration chose deliberate indifference,' Allred said in a news conference in Hartford on Monday. Angell was one of four complainants who appeared with Allred at the news conference to go public with their stories. She described going to campus police after her assailant accosted her in the dining hall. 'The officer told me, ""Women need to stop spreading their legs like peanut butter or rape is going to keep happening until the cows come home"",' Angell said. 'Shocked, I left feeling confused, violated, traumatized and vulnerable.' Four current students and three recent graduates are asking for an investigation under the federal Title IX law, which protects students from sexual discrimination in any education program that receives federal aid. Victim: Kylie Angell, left, cries as she describes the effect being on the same campus as her attacker has had on her life . UConn issued a statement saying that while the women's cases remain confidential, the school felt each was handled appropriately. 'The University of Connecticut takes allegations of this nature extremely seriously, as the health and well-being of our students is a top priority. 'Our response protocol for these and other alleged incidents of sexual assault is in line with or exceeds best practices. 'We always must be mindful of the rights of the accused and the accuser while upholding our commitment to protecting the safety of our campus community,' the statement read. It said it would welcome any new information. It also said that in the interest of transparency, if would detail how each case was handled if the women agree to waive their rights to privacy. 'Our students should reasonably expect protection and due process,' the school said. 'They deserve the best response in the nation, and we're committed to ensuring that right.' No criminal charges have been brought in any of the cases. Senior Erica Daniels said she was drugged and raped by a co-worker on campus. She said she did not report her rape immediately, and was told by the school's Office of Community Standards that not enough information existed to take any action. 'I don't understand why my statement about what happened is not enough for a hearing,' she said. 'How many women are raped and witnesses are present?' Junior Rose Richi said she initially didn't feel comfortable reporting her sexual assault because her attacker was a male athlete and there is an 'overwhelming privilege of athletes on this campus'. She said when she did report the crime, the investigating officer told her he did not believe her. Allred said the school is required to investigate, potentially hold hearings, listen to witnesses and notify both sides of their findings. She would not say if she plans to file lawsuits on the women's behalf, but said she is working with a Connecticut lawyer on their cases. Traumatized: Kylie Engell broke down in tears as she described the moment she found out her attacker was allowed back on campus when he approached her in the cafeteria and stroked her arm . An officer told Angell when she complained: 'Women need to stop spreading their legs like peanut butter or rape is going to keep happening until the cows come home' Scene: A complaint was filed to the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights against the University of Connecticut, West Hartford, by seven female students . The civil rights complaint, if upheld, could lead to sanctions including the loss of federal funds. Carolyn Luby, the lead complainant, said they want much more than that. 'Federal sanctions would be the tip of the iceberg of what we would want,' she said. 'We would want cultural change, policy change, administrative change.' Luby said the school still has not responded to the death and rape threats she received after writing an open letter to President Susan Herbst in April about the culture on campus. The letter, which in part criticized the school's new logo as menacing, was held up to ridicule on the Internet and on conservative talk radio. She received rape and death threats, the Huffington Post reports. People walked by her on campus and called her 'a bitch', she said. One email she received told her, 'I hope you get raped by a husky', and another said, 'I wish you would've run in the Boston marathon'. Fraternity members sexually harassed her, Luby said, making statements like: 'Don't worry, we won't rape you,' as they drove by. Luby said police told her to deal with the threats by wearing a hat on campus so she would not be recognized. Speaking to reporters on campus Monday, UConn President Susan Herbst said she had not seen the complaint, but pointed out that both she and the school's police chief are women. 'I feel like this campus is very safe for women,' she said.","Nurse Kylie Angell graduated from University of Connecticut in May .

Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent. Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds now use the Snapchat self-destructing messaging app, compared to 24% of Twitter app users. Snapchat’s popularity has more than doubled from 12% in November. Facebook is still the most popular social media app on 76%. At the bottom of the list (pictured) is Tumblr on 6.3% . Snapchat (pictured) lets users send messages that disappear after a few seconds . Last year, its co-founder Evan Spiegel turned down a $3 billion (£1.8 billion) acquisition bid from Facebook. Facebook then launched a rival app called Slingshot in June. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, followed this with the launch of Bolt. In July, Ashton Kutcher tweeted his support for another Snapchat rival, called Taptalk. Taptalk sends self-destructing pictures and videos by tapping the screen and each file is sent with user’s location. Snapchat's popularity is also growing among 25 to 34-year-olds, and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the the younger age group. The figures were taken from comScore’s June Mobile Metrix report. At the bottom of the list is Tumblr, which now accounts for 6.3 per cent of users. Vine is used by 10.7 per cent of millennials, and Pinterest is just above on 17.9 per cent. Google sits in fifth on 18 per cent. comScore's vice president, marketing and insights, Andrew Lipsman wrote: 'Long term success in the social media sector is no given. 'Achieving critical mass is an important step in eventually reaching the winner’s circle, and with Snapchat it would appear to be right in that sweet spot. 'If usage begins to accelerate significantly from this point forward, who knows how big it can eventually get?' Last year, Snapchat turned down a $3 billion (£1.8 billion) acquisition bid from Facebook. At the time, co-founder Evan Spiegel said Mark Zuckerberg warned him his firm planned to launch a rival if he didn’t accept the offer. True to his word, Zuckerberg’s Facebook launched Slingshot in June. Last month, reports claimed Snapchat was in talks with investors, including Alibaba Group Holding, for financing that could value the company at $10 billion (£5.9 billion). Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, then launched Bolt, but only in selected countries, including New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. In July, Ashton Kutcher tweeted his support for another rival, called Taptalk. Taptalk sends self-destructing pictures and videos by tapping the screen and each file is sent with user’s location.

"By . Graham Grant . and Julie Anne Barnes For Scottish Daily Mail . Loss: Jodie Muir, 16, is thought to have died after taking a legal high with similar effects to ecstasy . A teenage girl was last night feared to have become Scotland’s youngest female victim of a killer ecstasy-style party drug. Jodie Muir, 16, is thought to have taken the drug at a house party in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, on Friday night, attended by about 50 people. She was unwell when she returned home and died several hours later, prompting a police inquiry. Last night, a senior officer warned of the dangers of the drug, which is rapidly regaining popularity. However, her mother claims the teenager did not take the drug and died of heart failure as a result of Long QT syndrome, a rare heart condition that can cause fainting and arrhythmia. Jodie’s death appears to be the latest in a series of drug-related fatalities in recent months, caused by ecstasy or so-called ‘legal highs’  that replicate the effects of drugs. These new substances are not yet controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Drugs misuse expert Professor Neil McKeganey said: ‘The growing number of deaths should be a wake-up call to the Government, just as it should be to young people in Scotland.’ Jodie is understood to have taken an ecstasy-type tablet at the party on Friday night. She returned home feeling unwell at around 5am and died several hours later. Last night, shocked school friends laid flowers at Eastbank Academy, Glasgow, where she had been a pupil. Police yesterday issued an urgent plea to speak to anyone who attended the party. A post-mortem examination has been carried out, but police said further tests were needed to establish the cause of death. Chief Superintendent Ciorstan Shearer of Police Scotland said: ‘My sympathies are with the girl’s family. We have specially trained officers providing assistance and support to them at this sad time. ‘As it has been suggested that she may have taken some form of ecstasy-type drug, it is vital that we trace the other people who were also at the party to ensure that they are safe and well. 'I would urge anyone who was at this party and has taken drugs and is feeling unwell, or knows of someone who took drugs at the party, to attend or contact their local hospital for treatment or advice.’ She added that it was ‘a very painful and upsetting time for the girl’s family and friends and Police Scotland will do all that we can to support her family’. Later, Chief Supt Shearer said: ‘At this time we know that there were around 40 to 50 other teenagers at this party in Rutherglen and we have managed to speak to a significant number of them. A post-mortem examination has been carried out, but police said further tests were needed to establish the cause of death . ‘It is vital, however, that those who have not already spoken to police come forward as soon as possible, first and foremost to ensure that they are safe and well, but also because they may be in a position to provide vital information to assist the ongoing investigation.’ NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde consultant in public health medicine Dr Anne Scoular said: ‘Many drugs are unregulated and no one knows what they contain or the effects they may have. People offered drugs should think very carefully before taking them. ‘I would urge anyone who has taken drugs and experiences symptoms such as a high temperature, aggression and muscle pains or begins to feel unwell or feels a more intense high to seek immediate medical help.’ Regane MacColl, 17, fell ill on a night out  in Glasgow and died in hospital after taking a 'Mortal Kombat' pill . In February, clubber Regane MacColl, 17, of Clydebank, Dunbartonshire, fell ill on a night out at the Arches in Glasgow and died in hospital after taking a Mortal Kombat pill, an ecstasy-type substance. Helen Henderson, 19, died in April after taking a ‘meow meow’ legal high tablet during a marathon 36-hour party at her home in Renfrew. She is also believed to have swallowed horse tranquilliser ketamine before collapsing on a bed where she was found by friends. In 1997, 13-year-old Andrew Woodcock of Bellshill, Lanarkshire, became the youngest Scot to die after taking Ecstasy. Grief: Tributes were left outside the 16-year-old's school after news of her death spread . Police yesterday issued an urgent plea to speak to anyone who attended the party . There has been a 15-fold rise in the number of seizures of ecstasy-type drugs in the space of a year, while nine people died after consuming them in 2012 – up from none in 2010. Scottish Government figures show 157,900 seizures of individual ecstasy-type tablets took place in 2011-12, compared with 10,000 in 2010-11. Drug experts at Police Scotland said ecstasy ‘gradually fell out of favour in the mid-1990s’. But in November 2010, it was noticed that it was beginning to return. Deaths linked to ‘legal highs’ could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016, according to experts on addiction. The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) claims hospital admissions are soaring and forecasts that deaths linked to the drugs could be higher than heroin in just two years. The rise of 'legal highs' – or new psychoactive substances (NPS) – were linked to 97 deaths in 2012. Hospital admissions due to legal highs rose by 56 per cent between 2009-12, according to new CSJ data. The think-tank forecasts that on current trends deaths related to the drugs could be higher than heroin by 2016 – at around 400 deaths per year. Ecstasy came into widespread use in the 1980s, when taking it was linked to raves and dance music. Its effects include euphoria, a sense of intimacy with others and diminished anxiety and depression. In the U.S., more than 12 million people have taken it. But its use has been linked to damage to the central nervous system. Research in recent years has suggested that long-term changes to emotional states and behaviour have been triggered by consumption of the drug, which affects chemical receptors in the brain. The synthetic stimulant, for example, triggers the release of dopamine, the chemical that controls the nervous system, producing a massive increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This can prove fatal. Medical studies also report that one in four people have suffered unpleasant side-effects, such as extreme paranoia and insomnia. Campaigners believe that ecstasy poses a real risk of triggering brain damage. They have argued that it can induce memory loss, decrease cognitive performance and has long-lasting effects on behaviour.","Jodie Muir died at a house party in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire on Friday .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . One look at Myleene Klass' latest lingerie shots for Littlewoods and you'd never guess she's a mother to two children. But, says the 36-year-old, her daughters are exactly what helps keep her in shape. As Myleene stripped down to her underwear to showcase her new campaign for the collection, which features a selection of sexy pieces, FEMAIL caught up with her to find out the secrets behind her enviable curves. Scroll down for video . Look away now, Bridget Jones! Myleene Klass this week unveiled her latest range of lingerie for Littlewoods so FEMAIL caught up with her to find out the inspiration behind her range and exactly how she stays in shape . Speaking about how she got in shape for her latest shoot, Myleene told MailOnline: 'I'm a single working mother to two young girls, I don't sit down! I swim with them and live in the park whenever the sun is out.' Speaking about her diet and whether she embarks on a healthy eating plan for summer, the star said: 'I do what everyone does: hibernate through the winter months and watch what I eat a little more carefully in the summer.' Clearly watching what she eats has paid off - she looks incredible in the new imagery showcasing her latest designs. 'Women's wardrobes are more versatile than ever and I wanted my underwear to reflect and compliment that,' she said of her latest range. 'There are items in the range designed for extra support that look fabulous and feminine, some flirtier, fun items and for the more daring, a half cup bra with extra laced up ribbon detailing. 'I like the red lace underwear as the shade is in a sumptuous, hot hue, the strapping detail is hugely on trend and ultimately, it feels good to wear.' Racy: Myleene says she doesn't diet in the winter but will pay attention to what she eats in the summer. Clearly watching what she eats has paid off - she looks incredible in the new imagery showcasing her latest designs . Something for everyone: Myleene says that women's wardrobes are more versatile than ever and she wanted her underwear to reflect and compliment that . So does she think wearing nice lingerie is essential for a woman? 'Well put it this way, bad, greying granny pants have never made any woman feel good,' she laughs. 'The best underwear is the kind that fits,' she continues. 'The dreaded ""four boobs"" effect or red indentations from ill-fitting underwear is not going to make a woman feel good so ensure you get the measurements right. 'It’s easy to fall into the habit of buying the same size and style but our bodies change for all kinds of reasons and that's worth bearing in mind when looking buying lingerie.' The former Hear'Say star has been keeping busy - she recently unveiled a beauty range for the store, too. Animal behaviour: Myleene also recently created a make-up range with Littlewoods and named each of the products after the women in her life . 'I like the skin to be the main focus in the summer. I use lighter, more shimmery products in the hotter months,' she said of her beauty regime. 'My new range of make-up (named after the amazing women in my life...I immortalised them in make-up!) consists of the perfect shades.' And it seems the future is looking bright for Myleene, who famously caught the world's attention in a white bikini in the shower on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. 'I've just had my jabs for a new show I'm working on that will be taking me to the darkest depths of a rainforest, she said. 'The benefits of having been in the jungle a few times now is that I at least know what to expect and the downside is I know what to expect! 'I do count myself as very lucky to be able to have these opportunities but also can't negate the hard work that goes into it all either. 'I'll definitely be wearing my sturdiest underwear that day...if only to keep out the leeches!'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A procession of ferocious storms has been lining up across the Pacific Ocean, with three of the most deadly set to hit land. A spectacular satellite image this morning revealed an unsettled Earth with Typhoon Halong, Hurricane Genevieve, Hurricane Iselle, and Hurricane Julion simultaneously churning up the ocean. The image, taken at 00:00 UTC (1:00 BST), shows the storms far from land – but they have since travelled and are about to unleash their force on Hawaii and Japan. The Pacific Ocean hosts a quartet of tropical cyclones - from left to right - Typhoon Halong, Hurricane Genevieve (which kept travelling west to become Typhoon Genevieve), Hurricane Iselle, and Hurricane Julio . 'I can't remember the last time when there were four storms of such intensity travelling the Pacific Ocean at the same time,' Julian Heming, a tropical prediction scientist at the Met Office told MailOnline. 'Ocean temperatures in the Eastern Pacific are a little bit above average and that has helped storms to strengthen the storms a bit more,' he added. Above-normal sea surface temperatures in the far eastern tropical Pacific have persisted this year - characteristic of an El Niño event. El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. Iselle was supposed to weaken as it slowly trudged west across the Pacific. It didn't - and now Hawaii is poised to take its first direct hurricane hit in 22 years. The image, taken at 00:00 UTC (1:00 BST), shows the storms far from land – but they have since travelled and are about to unleash their force on Hawaii and Japan . 'What ended up happening is the storm has resurged just enough to keep its hurricane strength,' said Mike Cantin, a meteorologist with the US National Weather Service. Typhoon Halong - Sustained winds are expected to be 85 to 100 mph (135 to 160 kph). Typhoon Genevieve - Sustained winds are 160 mph (260 kph), with some additional strengthening possible. Hurricane Iselle - Maxiumum sustained winds thought to be at 80 mph (128 kph) Hurricane Julio - Sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) are expected. Mr Cantin said that means stronger winds, though rainfall estimates of 12 cm to 20 cm in a short time frame remained unchanged. 'Not a major hurricane, but definitely enough to blow things around,' he said. Tracking close behind it was Hurricane Julio, which strengthened just after the image was taken into a Category 2 storm. The National Weather Service in Honolulu warned Thursday that gusts up to 55 mph could lash the islands, damaging buildings in its path. 'The physical size in terms of its diameter that you see in the image doesn't necessarily tell us how intense it is at the centre,' said Mr Heming. 'For instance, Halon in the West Pacific is the largest in terms of how size, and Genevieve is one of the most compact but also the strongest.' Japan is also bracing itself for high waves and heavy rain this weekend, where Halong is forecast to make landfall. Halong will hit Kyushu Saturday local time and slam into western Shikoku Saturday evening with winds of between 85 to 100 mph. Typhoon Halong shown at 00:00 UTC (1:00 BST) on 6 August 2014 as it gradually makes its way towards Japan. The country is bracing itself for high waves and heavy rain this weekend, where Halong is forecast to make landfall. Halong will hit Kyushu Saturday local time and slam into western Shikoku Saturday evening . The composite image was made up of infra-red data from the geostationary satellites of the Japan Meteorological Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A separate storm, out of shot, which that has been battering the Caribbean has a 60 per cent chance of hitting the south of England, the Met Office has warned. The remains of hurricane Bertha, which has now weakened in to an Atlantic storm, will come steadily towards the UK during the next few days. Forecasters now predict it is expected to pass over, or close to, the UK from early on Sunday after initially believing the UK was 'likely' to stay out of its path. While the south of England is most at risk, there is a 30 per cent chance the storm could pass across the north of France and just miss the UK.

Iselle is described by the National Hurricane Center as an annular hurricane, because it has a large symmetrical eye with relatively little convection to create rain bands outside the centre .","Image taken this morning shows Typhoon Halong, Hurricane Genevieve, Hurricane Iselle, and Hurricane Julio .

"The three factors that have the most direct impact on a wine's condition are light, humidity and temperature . By . Sarah Griffiths . Italian scientists discovered that red wine (pictured) ages four times quicker when stored at home . It is often said that a good wine tastes better with age. But a new study has found that if it is stored at home, fast ageing can occur, which leads to a less tasty tipple. Italian scientists discovered that wine ages four times quicker when stored at home. In an experiment, red wine kept in conditions mimicking a dark room in a house was less flavourful and contained fewer healthy antioxidants than wine stored in a professional cellar. The two-year study found dramatic differences between wines depending on where the bottles were stored. Two hundred bottles of red wine were placed in a professional cellar at 15 to 17 °C (59-62°F) and another 200 were kept in conditions replicating a dark domestic room, between 20 and 27°C (68-80°F). Dr Fulvio Mattivi, of the Edmund Mach Foundation wine academy in San Michele all'Adige in Italy, said: ‘We discovered a relatively small difference in the temperature speeds up several chemical reactions associated with wine ageing and even promotes new reactions that are not observed at lower temperatures.’ ‘After six months under domestic conditions the wine in the bottle was approximately as “old” as a bottle from the same producer and lot stored for two years under cellar conditions. The house-stored wine was ageing approximately four times faster.’ He said that the wine stored in the dark room had fewer healthy antioxidants and less red pigmentation than the professional cellar versions - making it less flavourful. Wine is one of the few commodities that . can improve with age but it can also rapidly deteriorate if kept in . inadequate conditions. Scroll down for video . Red wine stored in conditions mimicking a dark room in a house, was less flavourful and contained fewer healthy antioxidants than wine stored in a professional cellar (pictured), according to the study . The three factors that have the most direct impact on a wine's condition are light, humidity and temperature. A wine symposium in San Francisco, organised by the American Chemical Society, heard that it is important where grapes are grown, as well as how wine is stored. Another study showcased at the event, showed that Argentinian wine produced from purple Malbec grapes had more ripe fruit characteristics, sweetness and higher alcohol levels than the same type of wine made in California, which was more bitter and had more artificial fruit and citrus aromas. Researchers looked at the chemical and sensory effects of different regions using 41 research lots of Californian and Argentinean Malbec wines. An abundance of low quality cork trees with thin bark may be ruining the quality of wine corks. The . reasons for the lower quality of trees, which has steadily declined for . 20 years, can be attributed to climate change according to a team of . researchers. The bark of . the trees, which grow in southwest Europe and northwest Africa, might . be being chemically changed by increased exposure to ultraviolet light . as a result of climate change. The . genetic study was led by Dr Rita Teixeira of the University of Lisbon . and shows how the £1.2 billion ($2 billion) cork industry is at risk. To . produce a good product, cork producers need bark at least one inch (25 . millimetres) thick - if the cork is too thin it will let air into the . bottle and ruin the wine. But . the trees, called Quercus suber trees, have undergone a drastic . decrease in quality to the point where there bark is now as little as . 0.1 inches (three millimetres) thick - just 10 per cent the optimum . level. There are several . factors like climate change, landscape changes and the dry seasons . getting longer that could be causing the decline,' Dr Teixeira from the . University of Lisbon told Live Science. ‘The change in bark quality may be the trees' way of adapting.’ Research led by University of Lisbon says the quality of wine corks is decreasing. They say this is due to thinning bark on the trees that produce wine corks, known as Quercus suber trees (pictured). They have seen a drastic decline in quality in 20 years, and thinner bark means the corks are worse at keeping air out of bottles .","In the experiment, 200 bottles of red wine were stored in conditions mimicking a dark room in a house, and 200 in a professional cellar .

"By . Julian Robinson . and William Stewart . A flyer ordering Jews in eastern Ukraine to register with pro-Russian forces or face deportation has been branded a fake by religious leaders, including the area's rabbi. Pamphlets circulating in Donetsk demanded 'citizens of Jewish nationality' over the age of 16 pay $50 to register and be issued special passports 'marking the confession of faith'. But the flyer, described as 'grotesque' by US Secretary of State John Kerry, has now been classed by the leader of the city's Jewish community as a hoax, aimed at stirring up trouble. The leaflet distributed in Donetsk, Ukraine, calling for all Jews over 16-years-old to register or face deportation, sparked concern among the area's 15,000-strong Jewish community. Now many are looking at fleeing Ukraine for Israel . A pro-Russian activist stands guard in front of the Donetsk Regional Administration building in Donetsk this week. The Donetsk People's Republic has denied responsibility for an anti-Semitic flyer circulating in the city while the local rabbi has branded it a fake . The handouts, a chilling echo of Nazi persecution, were given to Jews leaving a local synagogue by three men in ski masks holding the flag of the Russian Federation, Israeli media reports. Jews living in the area of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, were ordered to register at a government building operated by pro-Russian forces or face the threat of deportation. But according to The Guardian, the city's chief rabbi, Pinchas Vishedski, told reporters: 'I think it's someone trying to use the Jewish community in Donetsk as an instrument in this conflict. That's why we're upset.' The Donetsk People's Republic, under the leadership of Denis Pushilin, has already denied any involvement in the anti-semitic handout. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, he said: ‘I strongly deny that this document on registering Jewish people is genuine. ‘I . have never written and signed anything like this, nor orders on food . coupons, nor taxes for businessmen nor registration for foreign . students, all of which have been reported. US Secretary of State John Kerry branded the leaflet 'grotesque' while he was in Geneva as part of peace talks. But the handout may have been a fake aimed at stirring up trouble in the region . Pro-Russian armed soldiers on a tank in eastern Ukraine where a flyer ordering Jews to register has added to tensions . ‘Those documents are aimed to discredit our people's republic. They are fakes.’ Of the order about Jew's being forced to register, or lose their rights to property, he insisted: ‘Look at this document. I have never called myself the people's governor, my job is different. ‘The stamp is bigger than it should be because it was Photoshopped from some real document. ‘I am personally strongly against any declarations of this sort made against Jewish or any other people. This is a dirty trick by our foes.’ Despite the denials, the episode has added to tensions at a time when pro-Russian and pro-Ukranian protests have already ended in violence. A number of prominent Ukrainian Jews came out in support of the pro-European demonstrations in the capital Kiev but they have not officially endorsed the movement. Russia has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the Jewish people. In the late 18th century, Catherine the Great created the Pale of Settlement, which dictated where in Imperial Russia Jews were allowed to reside, an area of about 20 per cent of then-European Russia which today is part of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and, notably, Ukraine. Tsarist Russia also saw a wave of anti-Jewish  riots, known as pogroms, which took off with the violent persecution in Odessa in 1821, now the third largest city in Ukraine, which had one of the highest percentages of Jewish population in the Pale of Settlement. Decades of pogroms followed, with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in the Russian Empire, notably in Kiev, Warsaw and Odessa. The trigger was the assassination of Russia's Tsar Alexandr II, for which many blamed 'The Jews'. Between 1903 and 1906 thousands of Jews were killed in pogroms, including the 1905 pogrom of Odessa which saw up to 2,500 Jewish men, women and children killed, according to historic reports. The pogroms,  harsh conditions and wide-spread poverty in the Pale of Settlement saw some two million Jews emigrate, mainly to the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s. During the Soviet era, the Soviet Union and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting Jews. Josef Stalin was said by numerous sources to despise Jews and under Brezhnev, Jews faced discrimination. 'Perhaps you got Ukraine confused with Russia, where Jewish organizations have noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year.' The . leaflet says all people of Jewish descent over 16 should report to the . Commissioner for Nationalities in the Donetsk Regional Administration . building and 'register.' It goes on . to explain that the reason for this is that leaders of the Jewish . community of Ukraine supported Bendery Junta in reference to the leader . of a nationalist group fighting for independence at the end of the . Second World War. The letter features the flag of the so-called Donetsk Republic, a self-proclaimed state declared earlier this month by several hundred activists who occupied the Regional Administration Building and the City Hall buildings in the city. 'In case of attempts to avoid the registration, the subject persons’ citizenship will be revoked with their subsequent enforced deportation outside Donetsk Republic including the forfeiture of their property,' the leaflet adds, before being signed off, 'Your People’s Governor – Denis Pushilin.'","Leaflet in Donetsk, Ukraine, ordered Jews to register or face deportation .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s long been thought that in order to succeed in life you need to think only of yourself and ignore the needs of others. New research, however, suggests the exact opposite is true and being nice to others actually stands you in greater stead to be successful. The scientists found that ‘givers’ were more likely to share knowledge, and in turn gain more information themselves. Researchers in Germany found that people who shared knowledge (stock image shown) were more likely to be successful. They asked participants to decide whether to share money or keep it. Those that shared it would double their money - but only if others did . Most people have a favourite list of songs they use to motivate themselves before a sports game or during a workout, but is there any science behind this idea? According to a study it turns out there is - music truly does make us feel powerful, but not all songs have the same effect. Researchers found some music empowers you to do great things, and levels of bass are a key factor in its effectiveness. 'When watching major sports events, my coauthors and I frequently noticed athletes with their earphones on while entering the stadium and in the locker room,' says Dr Dennis Hsu of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois. 'The ways these athletes immerse themselves in the music - some with their eyes steely shut and some gently nodded along the beats - seem as if the music is mentally preparing and toughening them up for the competition about to occur.' Researchers at the University of Tübingen in Germany divided participants into three groups based on a personality test: givers, takers and matchers. In a social dilemma task, participants were allotted a fictitious endowment of the equivalent of £240 ($400). They were then asked to decide how much of their money they would give to a shared group pool. They were told that the money in the pool would be doubled and divided equally among all group members. Thus, it would be more beneficial to the group as a whole if everyone contributed their individual endowments. However, it would be more beneficial at the individual level if everyone else from the group contributed, while the individual kept his or her own endowment. The researchers used this strategic information sharing task to examine how much and which pieces of information participants shared: the less important and already known information or the really important information only known by the individual. The results showed that givers are less self-oriented and narcissistic than takers. They found there was a clear distinction between 'givers' and 'takers'. And the results showed being nice means you share information more. This means that givers are more likely to gain knowledge than takers and thus be more successful (stock image shown) Moreover, compared to the traditional classification of prosocials, individualists and competitors, this new classification of givers, matchers and takers was better at predicting behaviours measured two weeks later. Givers shared not only more money with the group, but they also shared important information. Takers on the other hand kept both the money as well as different types of information. The findings suggest that it may not be enough to simply provide knowledge management tools in order to optimise knowledge exchange in a group of people. It may be necessary for leaders and managers to keep in mind the personality and interaction styles of their employees. Specifically, they should be wary that takers may keep the important information for themselves.","Researchers in Germany found that people who shared knowledge were more likely to be successful .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Scientists have developed a new technique that could see reading glasses banished forever. The operation involves placing a tiny implant - known as a 'Raindrop' inlay - underneath the cornea in a bid to reverse vision problems associated with ageing. It is hoped the painless procedure will combat a condition known as presbyopia, which diminishes our ability to focus on close-up objects as we get older. The procedure - which costs £2,495 - takes around 10 minutes and involves placing the tiny implant underneath a flap in the cornea . It is common among the over 40s and is one of the main reasons we are forced to buy reading glasses. The technique was pioneered in America, but has made its way across the Atlantic and is now being used at Space Healthcare in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. It could replace laser surgery, which until now has been deemed the only long-term treatment, even though it leaves some recipients requiring reading glasses in dim light. The new technique could replace laser eye surgery - which can leave some patients still needing glasses . The procedure also takes just 10 minutes, whereas laser surgery can last for up to an hour. Anaesthetic droplets are inserted into the patient's eye so they remain conscious throughout as the implant is placed under a flap of the cornea, the clear part of the eye. It corrects near medium vision by changing the shape of the cornea, with the central section becoming steeper. Lynda Marenghi, 57, a school bursar from Staffordshire, was the first person in Britain to undergo the procedure. She told The Sunday Telegraph: 'It was driving me mad, having to hold books further and further away from me and squinting to try to read them.' 'It felt like my arms were too short and I was diagnosed with presbyopia – losing my near sight. 'It’s an age-related thing and meant I had to wear glasses more and more which was awful because, being a school bursar, I have to deal with a lot of close work and spreadsheets on computers. The procedure costs £2,495 and is not currently available on the NHS. Mark Wevill, an opthalmic surgeon who has completed the surgery on a handful of patients, told the paper: 'Raindrop can't stop eyes from ageing. But it can help deterioration in eyesight caused by the ageing process. The new procedure offers hope to the 32million spectacle wearers in the UK and could reduce the £2.7billion a year spent on optical products - including contact lenses.","Procedure would help an ageing patient's ability to focus on close up objects .

San Francisco-based Claire Wyckoff has turned her Nike+ app and tracker into a makeshift virtual pen - and uses it to draw outlines on a virtual map. Her first creation was a corgi, but she has since turned her hand - or more accurately her legs - to a space invader, Slimer from Ghosbusters, and four penises. Claire Wyckoff uses the tracking app to produce drawings as she runs around San Francisco. She ‘drew’ her first image in June.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Tanning lotions and fake tans are considered a safer alternative to sitting out in the sun for hours - but how exactly do they work? According to chemistry teacher Andy Brunning, the reaction they create with our skin is the same reaction that occurs when browning meat in a hot pan. Mr Brunning has created an infographic to explain how chemicals in the lotion react to skin cells, and why this causes the skin to turn brown. An infographic (pictured) created by chemistry teacher Andy Brunning shows that tanning lotions  contain dihydroxyacetone, commonly abbreviated to DHA, and erythrulose. Tanning lotions contain up to 15% DHA, but many sit within the three to five per cent range. The higher the percentage, the darker the tan . ‘We’re all well versed in the dangers of spending too much time in the sun,' said Mr Brunning on his blog Compound Interest. Tanning lotions take around two to four hours to take effect, and will continue for up to 72 hours . DHA reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce chemicals called melanoidins. This is known as a Maillard reaction, which is also the name given to the reaction that causes meat to brown when cooked. These melanoidins absorb certain wavelengths of light, and this results in them appearing brown on the skin. This reaction takes around two to four hours to take effect, and will continued for up to 72 hours. As the dead skin cells are shed, these colour fades and this cycles takes around 10 days. ‘However, if you’re unlucky enough not to have the time for a couple of weeks on the beach, you might be tempted to resort to tanning lotions to achieve a tanned look.’ ‘These can induce the appearance of a tan, through the action of the chemicals they contain.’ Mr Brunning continued that the main chemicals used in tanning lotions are dihydroxyacetone, commonly abbreviated to DHA, and erythrulose. DHA can be used on its own, and while erythrulose produces a more gradual effect, and is often used with DHA, it is rarely used on its own. Tanning lotions contain up to 15 per cent DHA, but many sit within the three to five per cent range. The higher the percentage, the darker the tan. DHA reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce chemicals called melanoidins. This is known as a Maillard reaction, and is also the name given to the reaction that causes meat to brown when cooked. These melanoidins absorb certain wavelengths of light, and this results in them appearing brown on the skin. Brunning continued that studies have previously found the amount of UV-induced free radicals - oxygen molecules said to have a hand in everything from ageing to diabetes and cancer - produced 24 hours after lotion was applied is 180 per cent higher than untreated skin. DHA reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce chemicals called melanoidins. This is known as a Maillard reaction, which is also the name given to the reaction that causes meat to brown when cooked. These melanoidins absorb certain wavelengths of light, and this results in them appearing brown on the skin . Put more simply, this means the skin is more sensitive to UV rays a day after application and should be protected. Other studies have found that DHA from tanning lotions is absorbed by living skin tissue – as much as 11 per cent, but it’s unclear if this has any effect on the body. Elsewhere, normal tanning is created by melanin produced in the skin. When people use fake tan, they may believe they have developed natural protection from the sun’s rays, added Mr Brunning, meaning that many don’t use extra protection, and put themselves at risk. He continued that tanning lotions have an SPF rating of three, on average.","Andy Brunning has explained the reaction on his Compound Interest blog .

"By . Lucy Thackray for Daily Mail Australia . A four year old boy believed to be responsible for an attack on a two-year-old girl has been suspended from the club. But the parents say the centre should be closed down until a full investigation is completed into the attack. The toddler's mother, Kristel Ness, posted pictures of her bruised two-year-old daughter Eva on Facebook on Saturday, after she was allegedly attacked in the crèche at a Virgin Active Health Club in Frenchs Forest, on Sydney's Northern Beaches. ‘What is quite beyond belief is that not only could his occur while at a care facility, but that all staff claim they did not see the incident. How is that possible at any care facility which is meeting its duty of care?' said Eva's father, Rob Ness. ‘My personal opinion is the day care facilities at this particular club should be closed until a full investigation is done and the club procedures, staffing ratios and skill levels are properly assessed.’ Scroll down for video . A photograph of Eva on the day of the attack shows a bite mark on the two-year-old's face and neck . Two-year-old Eva Ness also has a black eye and bruises on her forehead and cheeks, believed to have been suffered whilst at the creche at Virgin Active health club in Frenchs Forest on Sydney's northern beaches . Eva Ness also has big red welts on her back, which appear to be bite marks, after the alleged incident at a childcare facility . The club has confirmed that the four-year-old boy has been suspended from the creche and the section of the 'Club V' creche where the incident took place, known as 'Big A', has been temporarily closed. Kristel Ness told Daily Mail Australia that her daughter, Eva, suffered extensive injuries when she was attacked by a four-year-old boy while in childcare at the health club on Sydney’s Northern Beaches on Saturday morning. The club confirmed they are investigating the incident and say they have contacted the family to ‘apologise unreservedly’. Local police have also visited the parents, the club and confirm that investigations are ongoing. Virgin Active say no staff members witnessed the incident, which Ms Ness says left her daughter with ‘a black eye, bites, hematomas, and scratches on her head and face’. Ms Ness also claims that when she arrived to pick up Eva, her daughter was not wearing pants. ‘It would have taken a while for Eva to receive the extensive injuries. I cannot believe that no one saw,’ Ms Ness told Daily Mail Australia. Kristel Ness posted on the 'Northern Beaches Mums' Facebook group, but the post, which included photos of her daugher's injuries, was removed by someone else. The Virgin Active Health Club in Frenchs Forest where it is believed the two-year-old was attacked by another child. ‘When I arrived at the crèche she was so upset but wouldn’t come to me. When we got home she was still screaming, so I gave her some Panadol and let her sleep instead of taking her straight to the doctor, so she could calm down. ‘I then took her to the doctor and he couldn’t examine her properly, she was hiding in the corner. Normally she loves the doctor. She wears her own stethoscope and loves it.’ ‘Eva has bounced back a little but gets teary when I ask her about it and says, “no, no, no”. ‘ . The club told Mail Australia: ‘We had an unfortunate incident occur between two young children at our Frenchs Forest club. 'On Saturday 23 August, a 2-year old girl was playing in our kids club, Club V, at our club in Frenchs Forest, when she suffered bruising to the face and bite marks on her face and back, following an altercation with another child in the facility. 'Our staff were nearby, but did not witness the incident, and were not able to prevent it. ‘We are currently undertaking a full investigation to understand, exactly what took place, how it could have been prevented, and what can be done to prevent a similar incident happening in the future. ‘We are extremely sorry that this incident has taken place, and have apologised unreservedly to the little girl and her family.' Kristel Ness says her daughter was crying and unsettled when they came home from the health club. Ms Ness gave her daughter Panadol so she could sleep, at which point she took this photo to document the injuries, before taking her daughter to the doctors. Ms Ness took her children to the crèche at 10.30am and left at 10.45am. She says was called about the incident an hour later. Her husband Rob then emailed the club to claim: ‘My wife was contacted by a staff member & told Eva had been bitten by a baby, but was okay & there was no need for her to come straight away. Regardless she did go to check on Eva immediately & slowly we began to realise the terror our daughter must have been put through.’ Eva and her one-year-old sister Mia have attended the day care four to five times a week for two months. ‘She’s unsettled, it seems like she’s having nightmares and she’s waking through the night. I’ve been sleeping by her side,’ Ms Ness said. ‘The police came over and then went to the crèche but I don’t know the outcome, I won’t know until I see the police report.’ The incident report filled out by the head of the crèche states that: ‘Eva was playing with another child who retaliated and hurt her.’ The health club, Virgin Active, says they are extremely sorry about the incident and apologise unreservedly to the parents. ‘We are still getting weird conflicting stories. We are so disappointed with how Virgin has responded,’ Ms Ness told Daily Mail Australia. ‘When the club’s operations director came to our home last night, I was so unhappy (with what was being said) I soon asked him to leave. Ms Ness says she received an anonymous letter from the mother of the child who is believed to have attacked Eva. The mother wrote that the child involved has had 'his superhero costumes have been taken away and he has been made to do more chores' to reprimand him. ‘The club put a message out on Facebook saying that they were concerned for our family before contacting us. They posted a long message but from what I’ve seen I believe none of it is true. They are just trying to hush it all up. ‘One of the things that makes me most angry was that Eva didn’t have pants on when I arrived. I saw them carrying the pants out of the area, called the Big A (where Eva was found after the attack),’ she said, adding that the pants weren’t returned to her until last night.’ A NSW Police spokesman said an investigation was continuing. Eva's parents do not feel that the incident is being taken seriously by the club and are dissatisfied by their conversations with the club, who say they are launching a full investigation.","Two-year-old was allegedly attacked by four-year-old boy at Sydney crèche .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Ever wanted to bring your drawings to life in three-dimensions? Well now you can, thanks to a unique pen that 'writes' with warm thermoplastic that hardens within seconds. The pen can used to create stunning replicas of some of the world's most famous sculptures and buildings, including the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben. Scroll down for video . 3Doodler from Boston has revealed their 3D-printing pen (shown). It expels melted plastic which then cools to create 3D objects in mid-air. The pen has three 'writing' speeds to allow for different levels of complexity. Artists can also download blueprints to recreate famous landmarks . To create their designs, users download blueprints of world-renowned landmarks, trace them on paper to create plastic lines, and then mend them together with the special 3D pen. Another pen on the market comes from London-based Lix (shown above). Their pen is 6.45in (16.3 cm) long, 0.55in (1.4 cm) in diameter and weighs 1.23 ounces (34.9 grams). It is made of aluminium and comes in black or grey. Inside the pen it heats plastic to 150°C (300°F), which is then pushed out through the nib as a hot liquid at the touch of a button. The plastic used is a plant-based filament, although it can also use stronger forms of plastic. When the liquid is exposed to air it solidifies into shapes. It will retail for £85 ($139.95) when it goes on sale in September. The pen itself is powered by an AC cord and it heats up in less than a minute. Users can then choose from three 'writing' speeds and more than 12 colours - including black, red, yellow, green and blue - to create their designs. At 7.5 inches (19cm) long, 1.5 inches (3.8cm) in diameter, the £99 pen (US RRP $99) is portable and designs take around two hours to complete. The pen is plugged in to a power source via its cable to be recharged. It can melt two types of plastic, ABS and PLA, with the former being heated to 230°C (445°F) and the latter 210°C (410°F). It is distributed by Firebox in the UK and Hammacher Schlemmerin the US. A spokeswoman from Hammacher Schlemmer said: 'Instead of releasing ink, this pen extrudes warm thermoplastic that hardens within seconds, allowing you to create three-dimensional freehand drawings. 'Artists can download blueprints of a 6-inch (15cm) tall Eiffel Tower, a napkin holder, or even Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque. 'They can then trace the designs and mend them together with the 3D pen, creating hand-drawn three-dimensional objects. 'Since the plastic hardens quickly, users can draw in the air to create a bird's outstretched wing or connect two faces of a cube.' The pen heats plastic to temperatures of up to 230°C (445°F) to create the structures and also has a fan (seen above) to make sure that it doesn't overheat when it is being held. The expelled thermoplastic hardens within seconds to form objects in mid-air .","3Doodler from Boston has revealed their unique 3D printing pen .

If female Little League phenom Mo'Ne Davis needed any further proof she's captivated the sports world, she has it: the 13-year-old Philadelphia girl has scored a Sports Illustrated cover. Davis, whose 70mph pitch helped clench a no-hitter for her team Friday, will be the first Little League of either gender to have the honor. She appears on the SI cover, with the headline 'Remember her name,' on the August 25 issue. Captivating: The Little League World series standout pitcher Mo'ne Davis will become the first Little Leaguer to ever grace the cover of Sports Illustrated . Phenom: Davis captivated the sports world with her no-hitter--a first for a girl in the series--on Friday and her 70mph fastball . Not that fans, who have lined the grassy hills beyond the playing field at the Little World Series to see Davis play, really need to be told of her prodigious skills. The concession stands have sold out of the powder-blue T-shirts of her Mid-Atlantic team. With her long braids dangling over her shoulders on every pitch, the Philadelphia star is a captivating presence and has been in a league of her own on the baseball diamond — the first female to win a game, let alone a two-hit shutout, in series history. Davis, one of two girls at the Little League World Series, threw a two-hitter to help Philadelphia beat Nashville 4-0 on Friday in the opener for both teams. The first girl to appear for a U.S. team in South Williamsport since 2004, Davis received rousing cheers during pregame introductions, every time she stepped to the plate and after she struck out the final batter. Davis had eight strikeout and didn't walk a batter. She retired the first six batters and needed only 70 pitches to complete the game. She was hitless in three at-bats. And yet, in spite of her 70 mph fastball, baseball isn't Davis' best game. Her basketball coach said she is even better on the hardwood. 'Coaching boys and girls in this age group for two decades, Mo'ne is just a special talent,' said Debra Brady, Davis's basketball coach at Springside Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia. 'She's a phenomenal pitcher, but I think her best sport is basketball. In a year or so, she will be doing the same unbelievable things in basketball. The first couple of games I coached her, she was head and shoulders above any kid I've ever coached at that age level.' Davis, who is expected to pitch Wednesday night against Las Vegas, has not shied from using her riveting success in a positive way. Many gifts: Davis' prodigious gifts extend to other sports. According to her coaches, the 13-year-old also excels at basketball and soccer . She sacrificed time with teammates to do a national television interview late Sunday night, and of course there's the Sports Illustrated cover. While Davis and her teammates have been inundated by the media, their next opponent has toiled in virtual anonymity. Las Vegas, the first Nevada team to make the Little League World Series, kind of likes it that way. 'It allows us to play our game,' said manager Ashton Cave, whose team has scored 25 runs in winning its first two games against Rapid City, South Dakota, and the all-black Jackie Robinson West team from Chicago. 'We like to be the underdog.' And facing a girl won't be something new because there's an all-star female pitcher in their league back home.

"By . Chris Kitching . Washington's National Portrait Gallery has joined the legion of fans paying tribute to late actor Robin Williams. The gallery is displaying a photograph of the comedian that was taken for the cover of a Time magazine issue that was published in March 1979. The portrait shows Williams, then a fresh-faced 27-year-old, during his meteoric rise to fame as Mork from the television comedy Mork & Mindy. Scroll down for video . In memoriam: National Portrait Gallery in Washington pays tribute to late actor Robin Williams . David Ward, senior historian at the National Portrait Gallery, said the photograph is from the gallery's Time collection. He told Smithsonian.com: 'It was just as he made his breakthrough from stand-up to TV and then movies.' After he learned of the Oscar-winning actor's death, Ward assembled a team to retrieve the image from off-site storage and prepare a spot for it. The Time article that accompanied the photo documents Williams' ascent from 'a nobody' to a national television star who was watched by an average of 60 million viewers a week. The article began: 'Five months ago he was what Hollywood likes to call a complete nobody. 'He became what moguls love to call an overnight star.' The photograph was taken by Michael Dressler. It will be displayed for a few weeks in a spot where the National Portrait Gallery hangs portraits of icons who have passed away, Smithsonian.com reports. Williams was found hanged in his home near San Francisco on Monday morning, authorities say. Robin Williams became an overnight star thanks to his role as an alien on the TV series Mork & Mindy .","Photograph published in 1979 amid comedian's meteoric rise to fame .

"By . Matt Risley . I am not a fit man. This is the thought that goes barrelling around my head as I lay my mountain bike against a pineapple bush, and slump against the bark of a mango tree. I lean back, and survey the sweeping, verdant panorama of the plantation fields before me. I am exhausted. It is only the second day of my attempt to traverse Costa Rica by muscle power. And while the scenery is spectacular, it turns out that my lung capacity is not. Can a view still be breathtaking when you don't have the breath to take it in, I wonder? Success, in spite of it all: Matt celebrates as he reaches the Pacific coast of Costa Rica - after a week of pain . How did I get here? Well firstly, by following the crowd. Adventure travel holidays are on the rise. The market has grown at 65 per cent a year since 2009, according to the Adventure Tourism Marketing Study. With such statistics, surely anyone can climb onto a bike, or up a mountain, or down a glacier, right? Right? Throwing caution (and common sense) to the wind, I decide to book myself onto a trip that offers the opportunity to 'Conquer Costa Rica' - through by bike and raft alone. Now, if you are going to 'conquer' any country - in terms of crossing it, rather than anything, you know, military - Costa Rica is an excellent choice. It may comprise only 0.1 per cent of the world's landmass, but it boasts five per cent of its biodiversity, with scenery varying from sub-alpine dwarf vegetation to unspoiled rainforest, coastlines of white sand, and arid, dusty farmland. Add in a wildlife checklist to make even David Attenborough jealous (jaguars, monkeys, toucans, parrots, green sea turtles and roughly 850 species of birds), and it is a must-see for any traveller. Taking a well-deserved breather: Matt enjoys a moment of respite during his marathon cross-country ride . Working on the presumption that you never forget how to ride a bike, and that I have previously cycled 40 miles over two days through undulating Venetian countryside (with multiple prosecco- and pizza-stops along the way), I set off to Costa Rica with a whopping two hours of gym training under my belt. It is a fearsome preparation regime that pays off wonderfully for the first two days, as our group glides down the gorgeous Pacuare River on rafts - with nothing but the occasional splash-inducing rapid, blue butterfly kerfuffle or waterfall ascent (and subsequent leap down) to break up the day. But the next leg of our trip - a 300-mile bike ride from the Caribbean to the Pacific coast, west across the torso of the country - will not turn out to be quite as gentle. After a short drive, we unload our bikes on the edge of the Caribbean Sea, just a few hundred metres from where Christopher Columbus anchored in 1502. It is an inspiring start, and with a belly full of the local gallo pinto (rice and beans) fuelling our calves, we set off on a 32-mile day ride. A sight to soothe the soul: Costa Rica deals in spectacular scenery - and glorious sunsets . The route takes in beachside trundles under coconut trees, with howler monkeys and sloths alternately wailing and unfurling in the rainforest overhead. We play games of cardiovascular hopscotch across train tracks with bikes in tow, and eat a native cascado lunch (meat, salad, rice and beans) in a locals-only hangout. We chart a heady route through working banana plantations (and enjoy a fascinating introduction to fruit-picking, courtesy of our local guides and those working in the fields). Predictably (or hilariously, depending on your viewpoint), things did not stay quite as sedate. While meteorologists may praise Costa Rica for its 'perfect' tropical climate, conditions feel less than ideal when you are cycling in 36°C heat. With no shade. Are you sure this was a good idea? Matt did little training ahead of his epic ride - but survived . Throw in numerous boat crossings (some across crocodile-infested waters), groin-destroying mega-rides (80 miles with multiple off-road stretches, and with a volcano-scaling finale) and I - for one - am not laughing (I do not have the energy). Add in the occasional over-the-handlebars face-plant, and each day becomes a true challenge. Not only of fitness, but of mental fortitude. Of course, the whole incredible journey brings with it timeless memories: endorphine-soaring stretches alongside stunningly beautiful azure lakes, and speedy blitzes through dazzling limestone quarries. Muscle-soothing soaks in natural hot springs at the foot of volcanoes, and lazy lunches relaxing in the shade of mango trees. And, best of all, the final, ecstatic joy of cracking open a bottle of champagne while gazing at the Pacific Ocean, after 300 miles of hard-fought exertion. The real joy of adventure travel is the sobering gift of perspective. Sure, I may not be as fit or prepared as I should be. But when your biggest concern is how many bewilderingly gorgeous mountains you have to summit in a single day, aching legs and a few thousand beads of sweat are a small price. BikeHike Adventures (01604 7312442; www.bikehike.com) offers a 13-day 'Ride to Conquer Costa Rica' tour. This includes two days of whitewater rafting on the Pacuare River, and seven days of biking from the Caribbean to the Pacific (a distance of 300 miles).

"By . Emily Payne . Four drunken holidaymakers have been forced to write grovelling apology letters to the people of Newquay after being caught throwing empty alcohol bottles into the sea. Residents in the Cornwall resort watched from their windows as the gang, who had come to the town for the Boardmasters festival, lurched drunkenly and cheered as they hurled bottles from the cliff top at the Lusty Glaze beauty spot. Furious calls went through to the police and Sergeant Regie Butler caught up with the gang, in their early twenties, who were lurching unsteadily back to their holiday campsite. Holiday beauty spot: The drunken revellers threw empty alcohol bottles from the cliff tops at Lusty Glaze beach . He said 'I decided there and then to make them write letters of apology to the residents. 'What they did was just idiotic and unbelievable, really. 'They thought it would be fun and hadn't even thought of the possible consequences. 'So we were sat there thinking what we could do them for, and checked to see if anything had landed on the beach, because if it had we could have got them to clean the beach. 'We found bottles out in the sea, so it was a minor offence for littering. 'We thought the most appropriate thing would be for the lads to write letters of apology. 'So we sent them away with the bits of paper and told them to drop them into the police station by 3pm the next day, which they did. 'We told them we'd be out hunting for them if they didn't.' Grovelling: Sergeant Regie Butler decided to ask the drunken holidaymakers to write apology letters . 'Inconsiderate behaviour': One letter writer claimed to be dearly sorry for disturbing the peace . One letter read: 'I am sorry for all of our actions and it was also very inconsiderate, we will be sure to never act so stupid again and I regret what happened.' Another said 'To whom this may concern, I am extremely sorry the incident occoured (sic). It was just a moment of madness.' A third man wrote 'All apologies go to all residents around the area for disturbing them.' One acknowledged that he would not have committed the offence in his own local area. 'It is something I would not have done in my own town and I am genuinely deeply sorry for bottles being thrown in the sea while sitting on the local cliffs,' he said. 'A moment of madness': The letters assure local residents that there will be no more raucous behaviour . Apologies: One letter writer even thanks the police for being 'polite' and 'genuine' when speaking to him . Sergeant Butler said he stressed to them the dangers of what they'd done. 'Actions like this can have a huge impact. In the first instance it's ruining the coast, which is a beautiful part of the world where we don't want rubbish,' he said. 'Secondly, there's the danger side, when the bottles wash up and people can tread on them and suffer serious injury. 'Then there is the danger to the marine wildlife. 'Hopefully it made them think about everything we told them and will have had more of an impact than anything else we could have done.' Newquay has already issued a warning that parents who give their children alcohol will be named and shamed . Newquay has already issued a summer season warning that parents who fuel their youngsters with booze for a 'no holds barred' holiday in the resort will be named and shamed. The Newquay Safe campaign group says naming and shaming could stop what they call 'parent dealing' where mums and dads are happy to let their offspring have alcohol for summer breaks. Rob Andrew, from Newquay Safe, said that existing laws might not be adequate for dealing with parents who supply children with large amounts of alcohol before sending them on holiday. Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Hogg said: 'Parental buying is a problem, but you have to give credit to retailers, . they can detect this sort of buying and try and prevent it.' 'We . believe we now have evidence that the 24-hour licensing actually . enables pre-loading. 'There's now a feeling that you can drink as long as . you want. It allows you to purchase cheap booze, go home, and get . tanked up. Then you know you have plenty more time in the night to enjoy . drinking. 'For . me it's a no-brainer to try and limit some of this licensing during the . night. It's not working, 24-hour licensing has enabled a mentality of . pre-loading.' 'We . are seventh in the league table of 43 policing areas on violent crime, . we are fourth on rape, and we have been searching for the reasons behind . this and we have come down heavily on the issue of misuse of alcohol.'","Four revellers drunkenly hurled bottles from cliff at Lusty Glaze beauty spot .

"By . Carol Driver . and Emma Glanfield . A teacher on board the Virgin Atlantic flight forced to make a U-turn by an 'out of control' passenger has spoken of the terror at 35,000ft. Vicky Keen, from Bristol, who was flying to London Heathrow from Hong Kong on flight VS201, described a man 'roaming around the plane, shouting, ranting and being very aggressive towards the crew'. The man - identified only as a 26-year-old called 'Robert' - had to be restrained with straps by crew after 'losing control and failing to follow instructions from staff'. Scroll down for video . 'Terrifying': Vicky Keen, pictured with her husband Joel, was on board the London-bound Virgin Atlantic flight forced to return to Hong Kong . The flight had been in the air for just over an hour-and-a-half when the incident occurred. Expat Mrs Keen, 31, who moved to Hong Kong with her husband Joel, was flying to the UK to see family and friends. She told the Bristol Post: 'It was a very frightening experience. I was travelling alone ... so it really shook me up. 'There was quite severe turbulence and everyone had to be seated, but he carried on causing disruption so the crew had to intervene and restrain him with straps.' Mrs Keen . said the plane had to circle Hong Kong for some time before landing. She . added: 'Lots of people on board were hysterical by this stage, . especially the ones with children.' Flight VS201, an Airbus A340 destined for London's Heathrow, was forced to turn back to Hong Kong International Airport after the 26-year-old man, identified only as 'Robert', became disruptive (file picture) When the Virgin Atlantic flight landed, police boarded the plane and escorted the passenger off. Mrs . Keen, who teaches at an international school said she was forced to . cancel her trip home as there wasn't another flight available until the . following day. Once the plane returned to the airport, the man was arrested and sent to hospital, authorities said. 'The foreign man called Robert, who is 26 years old, lost control on board and didn't follow instructions from staff on the flight,' a police spokesman told AFP. 'He was shouting... When the flight returned to Hong Kong, the man was arrested for violating aviation security ordinance and was sent to Princess Margaret Hospital,' he added. A Hong Kong airport authority spokeswoman said the plane, an Airbus A340, had departed at midnight. A flight radar map shows the plane's flight path (in dark blue) and how it made a U-turn just 90 minutes after departing Hong Kong International Airport at midnight. The 'disruptive' man was arrested once it re-landed . One . passenger, who claimed to be on board the disrupted flight, said the . man had to be restrained with belts during the incident. Katie . Wong wrote on Facebook: 'He just gone out of control (sic). Talk loud . and walking ard. Actually he touched my shouter (sic) and go intimidated . at the aisle when the captain announced we're diverting the flight. 'The crew ended up put him down temporarily with an injection (we guess) and tied him up with belts.' Virgin Atlantic confirmed the flight had to turn back to Hong Kong after about 90 minutes, but was unable to confirm whether flight attendants had to restrain the man. A spokesman said: 'Virgin Atlantic can confirm that due to a disruptive passenger flight VS201 to London Heathrow returned to Hong Kong and was met by authorities on arrival. 'Virgin Atlantic does not tolerate disruptive behaviour by passengers on-board and the safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is the airline's top priority.' Katie Wong, believed to be a passenger on Flight VS201, said the man was 'out of control' and had to be tied up with belts by the crew in the process of being restrained. He was later taken to hospital after being arrested . Passengers left stranded by the incident were put up in hotels in Hong Kong and were due to flight out last night. 'The rest of the passengers were provided with accommodation before they depart tonight,' a Hong Kong-based Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said. Police said this morning that the man had not yet been charged. Authorities were unable to confirm whether he was still in hospital and what treatment he had received.","Vicky Keen describes man 'roaming around the plane, shouting, ranting'

"By . Rebecca Brett . For those who have ever fancied themselves as a James Bond villain they would be in 007 heaven living in this town - inside an active volcano crater. Budding Blofelds or Dr. Evil's might want to consider the real estate options buying a home on Aogashima Island, off the coast of Japan. Situated in the Philippine Sea the tropical rarely-visited volcanic island is just over 200 miles south of Tokyo. Surrounded by rims which are 650-1300m in height, the island itself is a giant volcanic crater, and within that crater there’s another smaller volcano . The entire island is classed as a Class-C active volcano by the Japan Meteorological Agency and the last eruption in 1781 some 170 of the 327 islanders died. It took just 50 years for the people to return and today it's home to 205 brave inhabitants. Today a small town still exists based inside the steep cliffs of the volcanic crater in a bizarre similarity to the classic bases of many film baddies. Visitors can access a sauna at the centre of the island unsurprisingly powered by geothermal gas. The steam produced by the volcano provides free heating, hot water and cooking for all on the island. The small island is just over 1.5 miles wide and 2.1 miles long with the highest elevation being 1,388ft high .

Web designer Yasuhito enjoys travel writing as a hobby and decided to visit the volcano after being fascinated people still lived inside a volcano. He said: 'Despite the volcano the people living there are living just as an ordinary Japanese, they fish and have agriculture and of course look after tourists. 'Unlike the James Bond villains they are not plotting world destruction but have lived there in some cases for generations.' According to geologists the island was made from the remains of four underwater volcanoes and the cliffs surrounding the island were formed by volcanic deposits .

It takes 40 minutes to get to Aogashima by helicopter which runs only once a day, otherwise you can take a boat which takes two hours from nearby Hachijo-jima . The island is barely reachable by boat as it has no real harbour to anchor boats due to steep rugged cliffs surrounding the island. The only other option to get there is to take a helicopter which runs only once a day. 'Travelling to Aogashima can be difficult even in modern Japan, there is a one-way airfare of around 15,000 yen (£87) or you can travel by boat for around 8,000 yen (£46) to the nearby island of Hachijo-jima.'

As thousands of UK teenagers gear up for A-level results day next week, figures reveal a jump in applications for working holiday visas for Australia and New Zealand. A student travel expert has said the rise in people choosing a gap year adventure is due to the jobs market in the UK being ‘still very tough’. Popular: Australia remains one of the top gap year destinations, with New Zealand, America, Thailand and Peru .

"By . Chris Kitching . A Canadian airport is reviewing its security systems after a woman managed to scale a barbed wire fence and run onto the tarmac in an attempt to stop a plane from taking off. The 37-year-old woman was trying to block an aircraft at Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Nova Scotia because she believed her husband was one of its passengers. An airport employee who asked not to be identified told The Chronicle Herald that the woman first asked staff at an airline counter to halt the plane because she believed her husband was leaving to see another woman. Security breach: A woman scaled a barbed wire fence and ran onto the tarmac at an airport in Canada . But it turns out the woman’s husband was not on any plane at the airport in Eastern Canada when the security breach occurred Sunday morning. Sgt Al LeBlanc, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said: ‘It's very unusual. I've never seen such an incident in my many years of policing.’ Airport employees scrambled into action when the woman scaled the fence around the perimeter of the airfield. She was quickly spotted by workers in the air traffic control tower and they rerouted a small plane that had just landed. Moments later, the woman was apprehended by employees and held for police, who are not planning to lay criminal charges. The unidentified woman suffered minor cuts when she scaled the barbed wire fence. An airport employee says the woman believed her husband was leaving to see another woman . The woman did not come into contact with an aircraft. Halifax International Airport Authority spokesman Peter Spurway told journalists it was the only time he can recall someone breaching security and making it onto the airfield. In addition to a 10-foot fence, the airfield is protected by cameras and infrared sensors used to detect intruders.","Security breach occurred at Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Canada .

"By . Rebecca Brett . Nearly 900,000 Britons have been issued with a fine for motoring offences while driving on holiday abroad. One in 12 holidaymakers have been collared for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car, according to a survey. The findings sparked a warning for British travellers to get up to speed with little-known local laws including a Spanish ban on driving in flip-flops and a French restriction on satnav speed camera alerts. Laws in European countries include carrying a spare pair of spectacles in Italy, having a clean car in Russia and not wearing flip-flops to drive in Spain . The research comes amid a row over an EU Directive that will make it easier for police in Europe to trace errant British motorists whilst foreign drivers in the UK often escape scot-free. The research found the popularity of self-drive holidays across the English Channel has soared in the past two years. Nearly a quarter of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car - a total of 11.5 million British holidaymakers. But 80 per cent have been stopped for motoring misdemeanours or picked up a parking ticket - equivalent to 878,000 penalised abroad. The figure does not include Britons fined on fly-drive holidays in hire cars. The survey of 2,054 adults indicated that 4.4 million will set off from home on road trips abroad this year alone - 2.6 million more than in 2012 when just 1.8 million drove to their destination. 24% of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car, it's essential that British travellers get up to speed with little-known local laws in Europe before travelling . It found that men are much more likely to contravene local laws than women - 9 per cent did so compared to 6 per cent of women - and those aged under 25 are the worst offenders. 'There are lots of different laws when you drive in continental Europe and they vary from country to country,' Victoria Walton, Insurance company NFU Mutual's motor insurance specialist, said. SPAIN Fines for driving in flip-flops and ban on using DIY hands-free phone kits at the wheel . FRANCE Fines of up to Euro £1,200 for using a satnav with the speed camera location warning enabled and compulsory to carry a DIY breathalyser . GERMANY Illegal to stop on an autobahn, even when running out of fuel . ITALY Compulsory to park in the direction of traffic on that side of the road and carry spare pair of spectacles if needed for driving . RUSSIA AND BELARUS On-the-spot fine for driving a dirty car . CYPRUS Honking a horn near a hospital prohibited . DENMARK Mandatory to check under car for children hiding before driving off . LUXEMBOURG All cars must have windscreen wipers...even if they don't have a windscreen . SCANDINAVIA First region to make daytime use of headlights compulsory . 'You may not know that it is the law to carry a breathalyser in France, illegal to use a hands-free kit in Spain and compulsory that drivers who wear glasses carry a spare pair in their vehicle in Italy and Spain. 'British tourists are also at risk of serious fines if they drive wearing flip-flops or do not indicate on the motorway in Spain.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said holidaymakers face fines for driving a dirty car in Russia or honking their horn near a hospital in Cyprus and warned that travellers could even be arrested if caught unawares. 'It's easy to throw caution to the wind when on holiday but it's important to be aware of the local laws and customs before you set off,' FCO Minister Mark Simmonds said. 'Laws and customs vary widely from country to country. We want people to enjoy their holidays so we encourage them to be prepared.' Motorists also risk fines for driving without the minimum third party insurance required throughout Europe and advised travellers to check policies to ensure they are covered on the Continent. 'Anyone planning a self-drive trip to Europe this summer must check both their insurance and breakdown cover extends to European travel,' said Walton. 'Some policies do not provide this cover as standard. You risk being seriously out of pocket and, more importantly, breaking the law without the adequate cover.' One in twelve holidaymakers have been stopped for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car . The 2011 EU Directive is due to come into force next year after a ruling by the European Court of Justice overturned a UK opt-out. The clampdown gives overseas authorities the go-ahead to electronically access driver records at the DVLA to pursue fines which are currently only enforceable if drivers are stopped by a police officer. Britain fought it on the economic grounds that the cost of upgrading DVLA computers to enable instant exchange of registered keeper details and the expense of processing penalties outweigh the income generated from fines.","One in 12 holidaymakers fined for breaking rules on foreign roads .

"By . Gerard Couzens . Holidaymakers en route from Spain to London on a coach were left stranded at the roadside for 12 hours – after their driver was arrested by police. More than 60 passengers – including Britons - on the budget Megabus service were 'abandoned' at a Spanish motorway service station after the company failed to send out another driver. Many people were forced to call and pay for taxis to stay in nearby hotels after discovering it was too late to make alternative travel arrangements. Scroll down for video . Coach chaos: Some passengers ended up sleeping on the coach during a  12-hour wait in Spain (file photo) And 10 travellers spent the night on the coach at the service station on the AP7 motorway, 50 miles north of Barcelona. Officers phoned Megabus to ask if it was going to send a replacement after detaining the 48-year-old Brit for allegedly using another driver's tachograph card. Customers were kept waiting for several hours before being told the company could not send anyone. Speaking from the scene, one passenger said: 'There's people of all nationalities on board including British and French and none of us know what to do. 'Holidays have been ruined. We've spoken to one man who has a plane to catch tomorrow in France and has no idea now how he's going to arrive on time or if the company is going to reimburse him if he misses his plane.' Police gave some passengers a lift to Girona Railway Station near the border with France - more than 12 hours after the coach was stopped - so they could continue their journeys. The driver was on Monday being held at a police station in Santa Coloma de Farners near Girona. He was expected to be questioned by a judge in a private hearing before being released on bail ahead of a full court probe. 'Holidays ruined': Passengers were left at services on the AP7 motorway 50 miles north of Barcelona, pictured . He was taken into custody at 5pm on Sunday after being stopped at Macanet de la Selva a half-hour drive north of the Catalan capital. A spokesman for the Mossos D'Esquadra regional police force said: 'Officers discovered during a routine stop that the driver was using a tachograph card belonging to someone else and arrested him for using false documentation. 'We immobilised the vehicle and after considerable effort managed to get through to someone at Megabus to explain what had happened and ask if the firm would send a replacement driver. 'The hours went by and we didn't get an answer and some passengers began to make alternative travel arrangements with some leaving by taxi. 'But ten people ended up spending the night on the bus and as a gesture of goodwill we took them to Girona Railway Station this morning so they could continue their journeys. 'The coach was travelling from Barcelona to London via Toulouse. 'There were several nationalities on board including British nationals. Megabus said the driver on board its Barcelona to London coach had the right documents . 'We understand customers did receive text messages in the end from the company saying it wouldn't be sending a replacement driver but would reimburse them for any extra costs. 'But they didn't get those messages for several hours and the company didn't come back to us at all. 'It's very rare for us to have to get involved in something like this.

"By . Beci Wood . Train travel is Britain's most romantic form of transport... with one in 10 people admitting falling in love while riding the railway. More than a third of rail travellers said they believe rail travel is synonymous with romance . And a further 20 per cent say they met someone who became a friend while on a train journey, according to a new survey. Kissing on the platform: Conversations with complete strangers can lead to something more permanent . The real-life Brief Encounters often mean that chance meetings and conversations with complete strangers in railway carriages often lead to something more permanent. The study is to mark, I Love Trains Week, an initiative by East Coast Trains, launched by TV presenter and actress Donna Air who agreed with the findings. Donna said: 'I think there is something very romantic about a train journey - it's the perfect opportunity to share some time with a loved one. 'There's a real sense of adventure, somehow you're in your own little bubble, and conversations and feelings become more memorable and intimate as you speed through the lovely British countryside. I love trains. They've been a huge part of my life.' Donna, star of Byker Grove, MTV and The Big Breakfast, has even changed her Twitter profile name to 'Donna Train' to launch the week. Getting cosy on the train: Two young passengers can't keep their hands off each other . As well as being the most romantic, train travel is also considered to be the most sociable form of transport, with 40 per cent of those questioned saying they would choose to chat to a fellow train passenger verses 15 per cent on an airplane and 11 per cent on a bus. Only 3 per cent of those surveyed said they would chat to another passenger while on the tube. Rail journeys also seem to bring out the best in people with more than a third (37 per cent) of those surveyed saying that they'd experienced a random act of kindness from a complete stranger while on a train. It was also the top travel choice for British families. The I Love Trains Week campaign, aims to re-connect people with the unique British enjoyment that comes from train travel and the memories it evokes. Train travellers and rail fans are also being encouraged to get involved by sharing their own reasons why they love trains via East Coast's Twitter feed @eastcoastuk using the hashtag #ilovetrainsweek - with prizes to be won for the best stories and photos. East Coast Managing Director Karen Boswell said: 'I Love Trains Week, celebrates the nostalgia and romance of trains and train travel. Sealed with a kiss: Train travel is also considered to be the most romantic form of transport . 'Whether it's visiting grandparents for the weekend, or the couple who first met on the 08.25 from Newcastle, train travel offers more than a journey from A to B.

"By . John Preston . WOUNDED TIGER: A HISTORY OF CRICKET IN PAKISTAN by Peter Oborne (Simon & Schuster £25) One of the many strange things about Pakistani cricket is that the aggression, the competitiveness and the bloody-mindedness the team displays on the pitch are nothing compared with what goes on in the dressing room. Reading Peter Oborne’s splendidly eccentric, if at times understandably exasperated, history of Pakistan cricket, I lost track of the number of times a player threw a tremendous strop and stomped off into the sunset. Matters were not helped when Saeed Ahmed, booked to go out to bat at the fall of the first wicket, locked himself in the bathroom and refused to come out, Oborne notes wearily of the first Test against England in 1967. Only a few pages later, Saeed Ahmed is at it again, this time going AWOL on a shopping trip with his wife. Imran Khan, who played 88 test matched for Pakistan between 1971 and 1992 and captained the team . On one occasion, in 1976, the Pakistan squad was riven by such dissent that two separate teams turned up to contest the second Test against New Zealand, one captained by Intikhab Alam and the other by Mushtaq Mohammad. ‘Who’s coming to toss with me,’ asked the puzzled New Zealand captain, Glenn Turner, ‘Mushy or Inti?’ As Oborne points out, deep fissures have run through Pakistani cricket ever since Pakistan became a country in 1947. To begin with, the shadow of colonialism was never far away. Much to the annoyance of local players, the cricket ground in Rawalpindi was dominated by an enormous statue of Queen Victoria. When the first Pakistan team to tour England arrived in 1954, they were treated either with lofty disdain, or baffled incomprehension by their hosts. After each day’s play, the team would go back to their B&B to wash their kit, while their captain tried to teach them how to hold a knife and fork. However, there was a taste of things to come when, having been comprehensively whacked in the first three Tests, Pakistan won the fourth test at the Oval by 24 runs. Pakistani test cricketer Hanif Mohammad, pictured in 1954, became the country’s first cricketing superstar at the tender age of 15 . Among the delighted spectators was one General Ayub Khan, who was later to mount a military coup — thereby setting in train the pattern that has bedeviled Pakistan, and Pakistani cricket, ever since. Cricket in Pakistan was organised very differently to other countries. Cricketers played for teams sponsored by the armed forces, police, or government departments, with the players in effect being paid to do non-existent jobs. When he was just 15, Hanif Mohammad, who became the country’s first cricketing superstar, was appointed to the post of roads inspector by the Pakistan Public Works Department. His younger brother Mushtaq, who soon joined him in the Pakistan team, was only 12 when he became a cement clerk in the same department. In 1958, Hanif Mohammad scored one of the greatest of all Test innings — 337 against the West Indies in Bridgetown. It took him 16 hours and 39 minutes, at the time the longest innings ever played in first-class cricket. Peter Oborne suggests controversial cricketer Mohammad Amir  wasn't guilty of match-fixing . There were no thigh pads in those days, and so Hanif pushed bathroom towels down his trousers to try to protect himself against the West Indian fast bowlers. Not that it did much good — afterwards, he had a deep indentation in one of his legs, while his cheekbones were black with burned blood from spending so long in the sun. Although this is a sober — and comprehensive — history on the one hand, it’s far less dry than this description might imply. It’s also a kind of love-letter to Pakistan cricket, a salute to its fortitude and fieryness. Oborne makes no attempt to disguise his admiration for some of the country’s most notable, and controversial, figures. Thus, the former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad, usually depicted as a colossal egomaniac, emerges in quite different colours here — as clever, courageous, and always willing to put his team’s interests above his own. Oborne even has some sympathetic words for the fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who was found guilty of match-fixing in 2010 and imprisoned. He insists, very persuasively, that Amir was an innocent caught up in events that were way out of his control. What becomes plain is that, in a country beset by tribal and political schisms, cricket is one of the few things that unites people. Remarkably, the Taliban turn out to be keen cricketers, although their insistence on wearing traditional costume apparently plays havoc with their stroke play. Even so, there are limits. Al-Qaeda have never taken to cricket, Oborne records. It seems they’ve always preferred the considerably less macho charms of volleyball.","Peter Oborne re-visits the match-fixing case involving Mohammad Amir .

"Wealthy Chinese tourists are splashing out up to £100,000 on hunting trips to Scotland, so they can feel like Downton Abbey's Earl of Grantham. Inspired by the ITV series, hunting parties from China are hiring out castles with butlers and staff included so they can try their hand at bagging some of the biggest game roaming the countryside. Shows such as Downton Abbey, which is a huge hit in China, and the Chinese media selling shooting as the 'sport of kings' has led to an increase of tourists to the UK, and more specifically Scotland. The ITV series Downton Abbey is hugely popular in China and is credited with inspiring waelthy fans to try traditional British sports such as hunting . People visiting from China, have taken a particular shine to the country and are hiring out castles in some of it's most picturesque locations. Among those visiting is Jack Ma, one of China's richest men. He recently hired out Aldourie Castle near Loch Ness for £36,000. Mr Ma spent a week with 11 friends on the 500 acre estate, also hiring staff including a butler and cook. Thrill of the chase: The traditional countryside pastime has become fashionable among the Chinese elite . The internet entrepreneur, worth £6.1bn, hired four helicopters for £1,000 an hour to fly him and his friends to some of the country's top shooting estates, where they shot 17 stags along with other game. Mr Ma, like many of those visiting from China, had no shooting experience before his visit, due to the strict gun laws in his country which were brought in at the foundation of the People's Republic 65 years ago. Lachie Smith, from the agent Highland Sporting, who led the group said: 'None of them had handled a gun before so we had to train them in the basics. 'Telling someone who has made billions that they can't do something is not easy, but if they shot one of the beaters that would not be funny.' Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, recently stayed at Aldourie Castle, near Loch Ness . Although Mr Smith said that Mr Ma and friends had gotten to grips with the weapons fairly quickly, he admitted he had sent a man from another group home after he had taken dangerous shots at a deer. Another wealthy businessman from China who recently visited Scotland for the sport bagged five five trophy deer - at a price of £5,000 a head - during one day's shooting on the Ardnamurchan peninsula. The group stayed at the Glenborrodale Castle, which costs £10,000 a week. Highclere Castle, in Berkshire, is where Downton Abbey is filmed and has also received a boost in visitors . Niall Rowantree, who runs West Highland Hunting and led the group, said that he receives up to 200 foreign hunters a year. He said that until five years ago there had been almost no interest from Chinese tourists. George Goldsmith, an agent in Edinburgh who organises shoots and sells sporting estates led a group of five Chinese shooters on a hunting trip in Fife. He said: 'We let them completely immerse themselves in that hunting tradition. 'We kit them out with the tweeds and set them up on a private estate so they can be laird for a week. It's the ultimate experience.' Mr Ma reportedly splashed out £36,000 on his stay at the luxurious Aldourie Castle in Scotland . He said that one Chinese client had enjoyed the experience so much that he had bought a farming estate in Hampshire and is now trying to acquire a shooting estate. Charlie Jacoby, who runs the Fieldsports Channel, said: 'We're thrilled with the channel's success among Chinese viewers and it shows how accessible and popular the sport really is. 'The Chinese see nothing wrong with shooting, it's just surprising that people do here in Britain.' Mr Li, office manager of Oriental International Hunting Park in Shanxi province, northern China, said: 'Hunting has really taken off in the past two or three years. 'It is just like the golf craze. It is still a relatively rare and exclusive experience.'","Jack Ma, one of China's richest men, recently booked his first hunting trip .

"By . Camilla Canocchi . The number of parents being fined for taking their children on holiday during term-time has soared by nearly 70 per cent in the past year. Some 63,837 penalties were issued to mums and dads in the academic year to July 2014 in England, compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months. Many of the fines by local authorities were for truancy or repeated poor attendance, but the majority were for letting children skip lessons because of holiday, the BBC said. Having fun: But the number of fines to parents taking their children on term-time breaks has soared by 70% . The news follows Government rules which were introduced last September under which parents who take their children on term-time holiday breaks are fined £60 per parent per child per period of absence from school. The fine rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days. Parents in Lancashire received the highest number of fines as they increased by 176 per cent to 3,106 in the year to July, followed by Kent where local authorities issued 2,973 fines, although this was just 3 per cent higher than the previous year. Other offenders were parents in Leicester, with 2,728 fines, West Sussex, with 2,403 fines and Luton with 2,249. The research, which collected replies from 118 councils out of a total of 152 in England, also showed that parents in Oldham, Manchester, East Sussex, East Riding of Yorkshire and Doncaster also made it in the top 10 most fined. Under the new rules, head teachers are no longer allowed to grant 10 days of holiday during term time under ‘special circumstances’. 1. Lancashire, 3,106 (1,125 in 2012-13); up 176 per cent. 2. Kent,2,973 (2,868 in 2012-13;) up three per cent. 3 Leicester,2,728 (2,726 in 2012-13); no change. 4. West Sussex,2,403 (973 in 2012-13); up 146 per cent. 5. Luton,2,249 (1,395 in 2012-13); up 61 per cent. 6. Oldham, 2,022 (1,190 in 2012-13); up 69 per cent. 7. Manchester, 1,911 (1,234 in 2012-13); up 54 per cent. 8. East Sussex, 1,756 (1,237 in 2012-13); up 41 per cent. 9.East Riding of Yorkshire, 1,594 (1,066 in 2012-13); up 49 per cent. 10. Doncaster, 1,464 (630 in 2012-13); up 132 per cent. The new rules received an angry backlash by parents complaining that going away with their children during school holiday time was becoming increasingly expensive. Parents Stewart and Natasha Sutherland, 39, from Telford, Shropshire, are refusing to pay . fines after taking their three children to Rhodes in October 2012 during . the school term. They risk being jailed after failing to pay up. Mr . Sutherland, who says he and his wife work shifts and find it hard to . get time off, said: ‘Once the regulations came into force, it became . just a block ban, rather than schools and local councils considering . each case individually. ‘It's now becoming the case that family holidays are just for the rich . because so many working people either can't afford it or can't get the . time off outside school terms. ‘Family holidays are just as important to children as school. A happy child will get their work done better.’ At school rather than on holiday: Schools minister Nick Gibb said that as a result of the new rules introduced in September, 130,000 fewer pupils were regularly missing lessons . Schools minister Nick Gibb said that, because of the Government's attitude, fewer pupils are now missing lessons. He said the government's policy had been based on research showing regularly missing lessons can damage pupils' chances of achieving good qualifications. He added: ‘As a result of the changes we have implemented, 130,000 fewer pupils are regularly missing lessons, which means 130,000 more pupils getting the chance of a good education that prepares them for life in modern Britain. ‘We do understand the concerns of parents, however, and are introducing new rules to give all schools the power to choose their own term dates. ‘One benefit of this may be that teachers, pupils and parents are able to take holidays outside of current peak periods. ’We hope parents and schools will make good use of this new freedom.’","Fines for term-time breaks soared by 70% to 63,837 in year to July .

"By . Carol Driver . A holidaymaker who was left needing hospital treatment after being struck down by food poisoning while on a birthday break in a Mexican hotel has been awarded compensation. Natalie Daymond, from Ryhope, Sunderland, said her holiday was ruined after she fell ill with severe sickness and diarrhoea while at the Barceló Costa Hotel near Cancun. The 27-year-old, who had to be hooked up to emergency machines, claimed the hotel had filthy bedsheets and bedrooms, served up pink chicken, and re-used foods during meal times. Scroll down for video . Food poisoning: Natalie Daymond was hospitalised for four days after staying at the Barcelo Costa Hotel . Miss Daymond – who booked the holiday with Thomas Cook - also said surfaces around the swimming pool were dirty at the three-star, all-inclusive hotel. The hairdresser, who stayed at the hotel in 2010, still suffers ongoing gastric problems, and instructed personal injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the conditions she faced. She said: ‘Me and my boyfriend at the time booked the holiday expecting a relaxing break for my 23rd birthday in luxury surroundings. ‘However, this couldn't have been further from the truth and we were disappointed from the first day by the poor hotel conditions, especially the pool, bedroom and food, which was on occasion not well cooked and appeared to have been re-used from other meal times. ‘I continue to suffer gastric symptoms now which can affect my work and it has been very frustrating that Thomas Cook would not agree to settle my case sooner, for a realistic figure.’ Four days into the two-week holiday, Natalie was struck down with food poisoning that left her in a hospital, hooked up to emergency machines for four days. Payout: Miss Daymond, pictured with the hotel's website, has been awarded compensation by Thomas Cook . As well as being diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, which medics said was caused by eating E.coli-infected food, she was taken to hospital suffering bouts of diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and back pains. A legal team took the matter to court after tour operator Thomas Cook would not agree a settlement which was felt reflected the severity of Natalie's illness and the impact ongoing symptoms have on her day-to-day life. A three-day trial was due to begin at the County Court in Birmingham last month, but Thomas Cook agreed to pay damages to Natalie ahead of the trial beginning. Miss Daymond declined to disclose how much compensation she receive. Jennifer Downing, a specialist travel lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘Natalie suffered gastric symptoms during her stay at the Barceló Costa Hotel that continue to affect her life now. ‘It is essential that food hygiene and health guidelines are followed by hotels to keep their guests safe. Tour operators have a duty to ensure the hotels they work with are up to standard. ‘We are pleased to have secured a successful conclusion for Natalie at the doorsteps of the court. We hope the settlement now allows her to move on from her ordeal.’ Thomas Cook said its customers' health and safety was its number one priority. A spokesman said: ‘We are sorry that Ms Daymond fell ill when staying at the Barceló Costa Cancún in Mexico in 2009.

"By . Helen Brown . H IS FOR HAWK by Helen MacDonald (Jonathan Cape £14.99) Five months after Helen Macdonald’s father died, she found herself pacing anxiously up and down a Scottish quayside, a cigarette in one hand, a can of Irn-Bru in the other, and an envelope containing £800 in £20 notes stuffed into her back pocket. The shy poet and historian felt like a drug dealer. Then she saw the man she’d come to meet, struggling with an enormous cardboard box that was lurching and thumping strangely in his arms. As he leaned forward to open it, she saw dried blood around a nasty gash on his wrist. And, suddenly, the female goshawk she had ordered burst out, in a furious clatter of wings and talons. Author Helen Macdonald in happier times in Scotland with a Gyrfalcon, the largest of the falcon species . Macdonald’s heart jumps sideways. To her, the bird is ‘a conjuring trick. A reptile. A fallen angel’. She hopes that the intense concentration required to tame such a wild creature will help cure her grief. Bereavement happens to everyone, notes Macdonald, but you feel it alone. She likens it to somebody walking into a room containing your whole family, and punching each member individually, hard in the stomach. ‘So, the thing is, you all share the same kind of pain, exactly the same, but you’re too busy experiencing total agony to feel anything other than completely alone,’ she says. Macdonald’s father, Alisdair, was a successful photo-journalist, ‘a quiet man in a suit, who had set out each day in search of things that were new, who had captured the courses of stars and storms and streets and politicians’. In 2007, he set out to photograph storm-damaged buildings in Battersea, and died of a sudden heart attack. The last photo on his camera is blurred, taken from a low angle, far too low, in an empty, London street. A young Helen ooking at a parrot with father Alisdair . A few days later, there’s a strange family outing as Helen, her mother and brother walk the streets, looking for his car. It has been towed. They must provide his death certificate before the fine can be waived. This is the car she drives to Scotland to collect her goshawk: his equipment still rattling around in the boot. From him, she’s inherited her ability to wait patiently and pay attention to the details of the world around her. As a small child, she would hide beneath a rhododendron bush on the hill behind her house and watch the world like a tiny sniper: ‘basking in the fierce calm that comes from being invisible, but seeing everything’. Macdonald says this drive toward ‘watching, not doing’ has not served her well in life. ‘Not with people and loves and hearts and homes and work. But in the first few days with a new hawk, making yourself disappear is the greatest skill in the world.’ She trained her first raptor — a kestrel called Amy — when she was 13, then moved on to merlins and peregrine falcons. Before becoming a Cambridge academic, she’d trained birds for Arab sheiks. But she’d always stayed away from goshawks — historically disdained by aristocratic falconers as the ruffians of the bird world, hunting in short, inelegant stabs and unfussy about their prey. Bigger and bulkier than the sparrowhawks that snatch pigeons from suburban lawns, goshawks are the ‘dark grail’ of the bird- watcher’s world. Helen with female Goshawk Mabel. The pair have an unusual relationship, with Mabel serving as the companion to her grief, Helen found the bird of prey to be as  brutal as her emotions . Although gamekeepers persecuted them to extinction in the UK by the end of the 19th century, they were successfully reintroduced in the Sixties. The females are so fearsome that breeders have to keep them in separate aviaries to the males — they will slay them if introduced at the wrong moment. In choosing a female goshawk as the companion to her grief, Macdonald is seeking a creature as overwhelmingly brutal as her emotions. But the bird she christens Mabel turns out to be a remarkably calm hawk, settling into life in urban Cambridge with admirable ease. It is bizarre to picture such a cool-eyed predator taking her first meat from her new trainer in a brightly-lit lounge with ’Allo! ’Allo! on the television. Although there is one terrifying scene, in which Mabel’s talons cause blood to gush from between Macdonald’s eyes, the hawk also surprises the human by playing — retrieving balls of crumpled- up paper in her deadly, Baker- lite beak. Mabel looking regal perched on Helen's hand . The 21st-century woman’s account of her mutually successful cohabitation with Mabel runs parallel to her sensitive analysis of T. H. White’s celebrated 1951 memoir The Goshawk. In that, the author of The Once and Future King (the Arthurian classic Disneyfied as The Sword in the Stone) retreats with fantasies of primitive survivalism from an unhappy existence as a schoolmaster to hole up in rural isolation with a goshawk. While Macdonald admits she wants to learn from her hawk how to become ‘numb to the hurts of human life’, White locked himself into mutually destructive battle of wills with ‘Gos’, — replaying the shame and terror of a traumatic childhood, during which both his parents made regular threats to kill him. He drives himself half-mad trying to stay awake for days on end with his bird, spoils the hawk with too much meat, and tries repeatedly to break the spirit he so admires. He becomes his own sadistic father. At times, he even feels he has become a hawk. During one chase, his hawk grabs a rabbit, and White pins the animal’s skull to the grass with a hunting knife. ‘Think of Lust,’ wrote White, who struggled to ‘cure’ his homosexuality with psychotherapy. ‘Real blood-lust is like that.’ But for Macdonald — who understandably prefers hawk-caught meat to the flesh of sad, battery-raised animals — the kill is the point where bird and woman separate. ‘Hunting makes you animal,’ she writes, ‘but the death of an animal makes you human.’ Unlike White, she has friends and family to help her through her distress. And she takes anti-depressants. She ends her exquisitely written book safe in the knowledge that her pain is a separate thing from her bird. Mabel’s talons have left thin, white scars on her hands. But hands, she realises, ‘are for other human hands to hold. They should not be reserved exclusively as perches for hawks.’","After losing her father Alisdair, Helen MacDonald buys a goshawk to help her  deal with the grief .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Mike Dawes . A sports fan who filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against ESPN announcers who made comments about him as he slept at a New York Yankees game called the experience 'upsetting' on his Today Show interview with Matt Lauer on Friday. Rector told Matt Lauer he was baffled when the stadium started thunderously clapping the second he woke up from his nap. 'Put yourself in my shoes,' Andrew Rector said. Angry: Andrew Rector is suing ESPN for showing him napping during a New York Yankees game on April 13 . 'How would you feel if you were broadcast on TV and all over the media?' Rector said that when he went to go buy a snack at the stadium following his nap, he got phone calls from people he hadn't spoken to in years telling him that he was on television. 'It happens to the best of us,' he told Lauer. 'I wasn’t doing anything wrong.'He said that once a Youtube clip of him surfaced online, a string of hateful comments followed. 'They put me on YouTube and created a public forum where people could comment,' he said. 'I’m a fan,' he said. 'I paid to go to that game. I brought friends that were there. I have a reputation as well.' He said that even though the announcers may have thought their decision to ridicule him was 'spur of the moment' that it still 'clearly crossed the line' The New York Post reports that Rector and his lawyer are still working out how they'd like to proceed. 'We’re figuring out whether or not we’re going to move forward,' he said, adding, 'I’m going to think about it for the next few days.' Rector said he'd 'possibly' consider an apology. Andrew Rector claims he has suffered emotional distress since he was captured on live television due to an 'unending verbal crusade' made against him by ESPN announcers Dan Shulman and John Kruk. According to The Smoking Gun, the incident relates to when the camera panned to his . second-row seat in the lower level of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and . showed him snoozing.

Major League Baseball has been named as a . defendant in the complaint after the clip was uploaded to the MLB . website as part of a highlights packed, allegedly causing a flurry of . insulting comments. ESPN announcer Shulman is accused of referring to the New Yorker as 'oblivious', while the second commentator, Kruk, is accused of saying a ballpark is 'not the place you come to sleep'. Shulman also questioned whether Rector had slept through a third inning home run by Yankee Carlos Beltran, which caused a huge applause from the crowd of 45,000. Rector, works for a car rental company in the Bronx, contends his distress comes from . being made out to be a 'fatty cow that needs to seats' and a 'confused . disgusted and socially bankrupt individual'. The incident occurred during a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 13. The lawsuit was filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx on July 3. It also claims that the announcers used words like 'stupor', 'fatty', 'unintelligent', and 'stupid'. Neither the announcers or ESPN have commented on the complaint.

He told police he did it for fun, according to a court complaint. Prosecutors said his arrest required a 'high allocation of resources.' He posed a danger to the high volume of pedestrians gathered who passed beneath him on a warm and sunny Sunday afternoon, they said. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city is launching a 'full scale review' of security at the bridge, but assured New Yorkers that they are being kept safe.

He was visiting New York with a tour group, but the group has returned to Russia. Kolchin was being held on $5,000 bond after his arraignment Monday in Brooklyn and ordered to hand his passport over to prosecutors. Liu told Judge Raymond Rodriguez that Kolchin did not expect to make bail. The attorney declined to comment on the case to reporters. Kolchin's next hearing was scheduled for Aug. 29. On July 22, two American flags were swiped from the bridge and replaced with white ones, prompting security concerns. Two German artists took credit for the stunt. Their comments and the case are still being investigated by police, who have not arrested anyone in the flag swap, New York Police Department spokesman Detective James Duffy said in an email.","Police said they spotted Yaroslav Kolchin, 24, ascending a cable at about 12:15 p.m. Sunday .

"By . Sam Creighton . Criminals are piecing together heat-detecting drones using kit they can buy from supermarkets . Criminals are using cheap kit bought from supermarkets to build heat seeking drones they can use to track down cannabis farms to rob. Tech-savvy thieves are buying drones for as little as £60 from supermarkets such as Tesco and attaching infra-red cameras to them, which they can monitor via an iPad. By flying the modified drones over houses, they can locate the drug dens, as cannabis farms produce a large amount of heat, due to the huge hydroponic heat and light required to grow the plants. Burglars are then breaking in to the premises and stealing the crop to sell on the streets. Any digital camera has the potential to film in infra-red, it's a simple task of replacing basic components, meaning it is becoming both easier and cheaper for criminals to obtain heat-detecting technology. Yesterday, Labour MP Tom Watson, who is the chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drones, said: 'This is remarkable and shows the proliferation of drone technology which can be used for both good and bad. 'It is no surprise enterprising criminals would want to get the upper hand in the criminal underworld by using drones. Scroll down for video . The drones can be bought from high street stores and supermarkets for less than £60 and then modified by attaching a camera . An example of the heat signature given off by a cannabis farm taken during a police sweep . The large amount of heat given off by equipment needed to grow cannabis makes the drug farms easy to detect with infra-red cameras . Criminals are targeting cannabis farms run by rival gangs. They steal the drugs and then sell them themselves . 'As a society we will be dealing with the impact of drones on our laws and regulations for years to come and it is time the Government started listening about privacy concerns about the misuse of drones.' It emerged the problem is particularly prevalent in areas of West Midlands where the tactic has led to a number of violent robberies as the intruders know victims will not call the police. One convicted burglar, who did not wish to be identified, said: 'I bought my first drone for a few hundred quid and learnt how to fly it over wasteland and fitted a wifi camera to it so I could look into people’s windows. 'However, I noticed police helicopters used thermal imaging cameras to find cannabis farms because of the heat the hydroponic lights give off so I bought a second hand heat-seeking camera one online and hooked it up to my iPad.' After finding a property containing a cannabis farm the criminal would either burgle or 'tax' the victim. The 33-year-old added: 'Half the time we don’t even need to use violence to get the crop. Even though the commercial drones only have a fly time of 30 minutes, they allow criminals to locate targets . The criminals strap infra-red cameras to the top of the drones and then monitor the images on an iPad . An example of the sort of commercial drone that is being used. While drones were originally just used by the military, they are becoming far cheaper and more accessible . 'Growing cannabis has gone mainstream and the people growing it are not gangsters. 'They are fair game, it is not like I’m using my drone to see if people have nice televisions I am just after drugs to steal and sell, if you break the law then you enter me and my drone’s world.' Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, were first used by the military but simpler remote control models are now on sale from many high street shops and have a flying time of 30 minutes. Civilian companies are now using drones for various projects and both fire services and police forces are exploring their use.

One convicted criminal, who has used drones to target cannabis growers, said: 'If you break the law then you enter me and my drone¿s world' The Association of Chief Police Officers latest report on commercial cannabis cultivation found the number farms had doubled in two years and police were discovering over 21 a day in the UK.

Bear-faced cheek: The two cubs were not worried that their mother was close by as they continued their battle . A larger bear, believed to be their mother, can be seen showing little interest as she buries her head in a bush - no doubt to get some peace and quiet. Another more well-behaved cub can also be seen in the 30-second clip, sticking closer to his mother as the other two, presumably his siblings, battle it out. The American black bear is the continent's most widely distributed species and is an omnivore with its diet varying greatly depending on season and location. Black bears often encroach on areas populated by people as they search for food. One recently climbed into a resident's hammock in Daytona Beach, Florida, to take a nap - the incident was one of many cases of bears caught sleeping in hammocks. American black bears have a hugely varied diet ranging from roots, berries meat, fish, insects, larvae, grass and other succulent plants. They have also been known to kill young deer or moose calves. They are the most commonly distributed bear in North America and and are the smallest of three species found on the continent. It is estimated that there are at least 600,000 black bears in North America - half in the USA.

"By . David Mccormack . and Bella Brennan for MailOnline . Disney smash Frozen has inspired a host of tributes and parodies in recent months but now someone has taken it to a very different – and kinky - place. Fifty Shades Of Frozen takes the dialogue from the trailer to the forthcoming S&M romance Fifty Shades Of Grey but replaces scenes from the Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson-staring movie with clips of the most popular animated film of all time. Once you watch the end result you’ll never be able to look at Frozen in the same light again as it adds an altogether steamier undercurrent to Hans and Anna’s romance which was wholly missing from the G-rated cartoon princess musical. Watch: Fifty Shades Of Frozen . Fifty Shades Of Frozen takes the dialogue from the trailer to the forthcoming S&M romance Fifty Shades Of Grey but replaces scenes from the movie with clips of the most popular animated film of all time . The forthcoming S&M romance Fifty Shades Of Grey features Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson taking on the roles of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele . As a stand-in for Christian Grey, Prince Hans is eerily appropriate as the mash-up shows the manipulative prince to have much in common with control-freak corporate titan . The mash-up is the handiwork of YouTube user Tranceart Violeta, who has skilfully pieced the two movies together. As a stand-in for Christian Grey, Prince Hans is eerily appropriate. He may not have a Red Room of Pain hidden in his castle, but the mash-up shows the manipulative prince to have much in common with control-freak corporate titan Grey. Other Frozen parodies in recent months have included the Oscar-winning song Let It Go rewritten as Do You Want To Be My Boyfriend, Do You Wanna Get A Beer, Man and by father sick of the musical who sings 'Let it go, let it go, I'm gonna smash the radio'. Not out until next February, Fifty Shades Of Grey is the hotly-anticipated movie adaptation of E.L. James' best-selling novel. The inspired mash-up is the handiwork of YouTube user Tranceart Violeta, who has skilfully pieced the two movies together . Pure passion! Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson put on a steamy portrayal as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in the 50 Shades Of Grey official trailer, which dropped last month . Fans were given a taste of what’s to come when the extremely steamy trailer was released last month, with Dornan and Johnson taking on the roles of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. The clip begins with Anastasia and . Christian’s first encounter when a shy Ana goes to interview the successful . businessman at his opulent offices - and the sexual tension is palpable right from the get go. A timid Ana is instantly enamoured with the ‘polite, intense, smart, intimidating’ Christian, who appears equally intrigued by the doe-eyed brunette. Christian asks: ‘I’d like to know more about you.’ ‘There’s really not much to know about me. Look at me,’ the nervous literature student responds as the camera pans out, capturing his high rise office in all its glory. Anna portrays Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades Of Frozen trailer and all the innocence of Disney is ruined . ‘To what do you owe your success,’ Ana questions. ‘I exercise control at all things, Miss Steele,’ Christian tells. Soon the tranquil mood vanishes and the pair’s intense, adventurous romance begins. ‘I’m incapable of leaving you alone. I don’t do romance. My tastes are very singular. You wouldn’t understand,’ a controlling Christian warns. But eager-to-please Ana doesn’t think twice. ‘Enlighten me then,’ she says. Raunchy: The trailer features glimpses of kinky love scenes between the couple . Frozen is the most popular animated film of all time and its Oscar-winning song Let It Go has inspired countless parodies including Do You Wanna Get A Beer, Man and a father sick of the musical who sings 'Let it go, let it go, I'm gonna smash the radio' Not long now! 50 Shades Of Grey will be released on Valentine's Day next year . A long process: After several setbacks, including actor Charlie Hunnam quitting the role of Christian Grey at the last minute, the crew finally began filming in December last year . As the haunting slowed-down remix of Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love lingers in the background, viewers are shown a kinky montage of the couple’s journey. The film, which is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, will be released on Valentine’s Day next year and boasts a star studded cast with the likes of Luke Grimes Elliot, Victor Rasuk and Rita Ora. After several setbacks, including actor Charlie Hunnam quitting the role of Christian Grey at the last minute, the crew finally began filming in December last year in Vancouver. Last year Jamie, 32, opened up to Entertainment Weekly about taking on the role following Charlie's shock departure. Their biggest movie yet! Dakota had small parts in The Social Network and 21 Jump Street while Jamie has appeared in Marie Antoinette and Beyond The Rave . Good bedfellows: 'That's a big part of it ... having trust,' Doran explained of their job . 'You know, one door closes, another opens. When [Charlie] dropped out, I didn't instantly think, ""Oh here we go, maybe I should cancel that holiday,"" but I did feel that maybe we'd revisit the idea of me' the Irish-born actor explained. As for doing Christian justice the father of one, who welcomed his first daughter with wife Amelia Warner in November last year, told: 'I've never felt that Christian needs to be some kind of monster, but I think it's very clear how he conditions himself and looks after himself.' 'I take decent enough care of myself anyway, so obviously I'm gonna up it slightly with training, but we don't have any intention to really bulk up. I don't think it's appropriate.' Daring: In one scene, Christian slides his hands up Ana's skirt as they sit at the dinner table with family . Experimenting: Ana and Christian don't hold back when it comes to exploring in the bedroom . Tumultuous: Ana soon realises Christian is controlling . Meanwhile, landing the coveted role of Anastasia Steele was a huge coup for 24-year-old Dakota, whose parents are Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, and it's expected this role will sky-rocket her career. Despite the raunchy nature of the film, the actress was comfortable filming the sex scenes. 'I don't have any problem doing anything. The secret is I have no shame,' she said to Elle magazine last year. 'Reading the book, I found myself more interested in the ways they were breaking each other down emotionally than the sex scenes. I think there's a part of a woman that wants to be the thing that breaks a man down,' Dakota added. Not so hot! 'It's not, like, a romantic situation. It's more, like, technical and choreographed and less. It's more of a task,' Dakota said of filming the sex scenes . Mum and dad are banned! Understandably Dakota won't be letting her famous parents watch the film .","YouTube user Tranceart Violeta has taken the Disney smash Frozen to a very different – and kinky - place with a new mash-up trailer .

"By . Aap . and Kate Lyons for Daily Mail Australia . Loved life: Alana Goldsmith was fun-loving, intelligent and successful, but she took her life at a train station in 2011 after fighting a long battle with anorexia nervosa . There were 'mistakes and failures' at the eating disorder clinic attended by a 23-year-old Sydney woman who committed suicide in 2011, a coroner found. Alana Goldsmith attended the Wesley Eating Disorder Cline (WEDC) for treatment of an eating disorder she had suffered from since she was a teenager. On July 22 2011, the day of her death, Alana left the hospital twice and was not seen by staff. She took her life at Summer HIll in Sydney's inner-west and was found dead hours after leaving for the final time. The Goldsmith family requested an inquest following her death, to review patient care and explore the issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners. Magistrate Mark Douglass released a report into the events surrounding Ms Goldsmith's death on Monday, saying that Ms Goldsmith's treatment at WEDC was 'adequate but not optimal.' 'The unpredictable nature of suicide makes prevention difficult. The mistakes and failures at WEDC did not lead to Alana's death.' In July 2011, a WEDC doctor was concerned that Ms Goldsmith's weight was in the moderately severe range of 42 kilograms. Ms Goldsmith had been in and out of hospitals for two years dealing with her eating disorder before being admitted to the WEDC on July 18, 2011. Scroll down for video . Alana (pictured right at Austrade awards ceremony with former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett) killed herself in 2011 at the age of 23. The magistrate ruled today that while the Wesley Eating Disorder Clinic she was staying at had made 'mistakes and failures', they 'did not lead to Alana's death' Judy Goldsmith, pictured at hospital with daughter Alana and baby Simone said Alana's delight at the arrival of her younger sister was typical of her 'joy' of life . 'Not being aware that Alana twice left the WEDC on the day of her death until it was too late to initiate a response is also a failing and of concern,' Mr Douglass said. 'If staff had detected her absences, particularly her first absence, there would have been interventions and a change of her risk category that would have demanded regular checks perhaps at half-hour intervals.' There was also a lack of professional rigour in maintaining attendance checks, he said. 'However, considering all of the evidence and detailed submissions, none of the failings were causative of Alana's death.' Mr Douglass told Glebe Coroner's Court last month that it had been a 'complex and harrowing matter with many difficulties'. Her family has said that Ms Goldsmith started wrestling with the illness when she was 15 and returned home from an exchange trip to Japan looking emaciated, but managed to hide it from her friends and family for many years. Life of the party: Alana Goldsmith pictured at her 17th birthday at Pymble on Sydney's North Shore . Magistrate Mark Douglass said it was 'of concern' that Alana left the WEDC twice on the day of her death without staff knowing . Ms Goldsmith's family have spoken out about the mental illness, saying they want to challenge the perception that anorexia is just about being thin. 'Alana was a fun-loving, vivacious and intelligent young woman until anorexia nervosa starved her brain and destroyed her hopes and dreams,' her sister Simone Goldsmith said in July. 'This silent killer is a highly complex mental illness ... We hope that the findings handed down today bring about meaningful discussions ... that result in more resources and better care.' In July, Alana's mother Judy Goldsmith posted about the inquest on the In Loving Memory of Alana Goldsmith Facebook tribute page Judy Goldsmith posted about the inquest.

Pictured right, the photo of the 23-year-old was taken on Christmas Eve, 2010, Alana's last Christmas with her family . Alana Goldsmith was a happy little girl with a bright outlook on life who later became anorexic while studying at university in Japan . 'We were fortunate to have a very involved coroner who engaged with witnesses about the myriad issues impacting eating disorder sufferers, carers and practitioners,' she posted last month ahead of the initial findings. 'We feel positive that this gruelling process will bring about change... I was given the chance to address the court and go on record on behalf of the family. 'We wanted those present to hear about our fun-loving, clever, vivacious, multifaceted Alana. She is always in our hearts. And to those who continue to struggle, please hold onto hope.' Butterfly Foundation CEO Christine Morgan said people with eating disorders need specialised treatment and early intervention. 'This is an illness that kills,' she said. 'It has the highest fatality rate of any mental illness and we cannot ignore that. We need to have effective treatment. 'We need significantly more resources ... we need more care that is in the community and psychologist and psychiatrists.' * Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . Dr Harvey Hawley Crippen was hanged for the murder of his wife Cora in 1910; two of his prescription books which were used in evidence to convict him are to be auctioned . Two of Dr Harvey Hawley Crippen’s prescription books containing a list of posions which were used as evidence to send him to the gallows have been unearthed and are expected to fetch £5,000 at auction. Dr Crippen is one of the most notorious killers in British history and was hanged for poisoning his wife Cora in 1910. The homeopathic practitioner was arrested as he tried to flee the UK with his mistress Ethel Le Neve, who had disguised herself as a young boy for the journey. The American was put to death after a trial at the Old Bailey which captivated the Edwardian public at the time. His ledgers mainly contain worthless ‘quack’ remedies which were promoted by the notorious conman James Munyon, but they also feature prescriptions and poisons. Crippen made a fortune peddling potions - which were usually nothing more than sugar and alcohol - to a gullible public towards the end of the 19th century. He became Mr Munyon’s first London manager until he was sacked in 1899 - 11 years before he was hanged - for spending too much time managing his wife's stage career. The books both bear red leather labels and say: 'The preparations log books of Munyon Remedies London, removed by warrant reviewed in the murder trial of Dr H H Crippen found guilty and duly hanged Nov 23 1910.' They also have labels on the spine gilt which read: 'Reviewed by Dr A Winter Blyt Home Office 1910’ H.H. Crippen Albion House Evidence 1910’ and ‘Wm Long Esq Collection, London'. Each ledger includes numerous prescriptions - with some pages containing stamps with the logo of the Home Office. The inside covers also contain two portrait photos which are unidentified, press cuttings relating to the Crippen Case and a solicitor letter chasing a debt. Labels on Crippen's ledgers state that the prescription books were used during his murder trial and record the date he was hanged . The ledgers contain lists of poisons and prescriptions and cover the period from 1893 to 1896 . The ledgers also contain a list of the names of some of Crippen's patients . The inside covers of the ledgers contain two unidentified portrait photos, press cuttings relating to his case and a solicitors letter chasing a debt . They both cover the period from 1893 to 1896 and include an alphabetical index and the names of patients. The books are expected to fetch between £3,000-£5,000 when they are sold at Mullock’s Auctioneers online sale on September 2. Richard Westwood-Brookes, historical documents expert at Mullocks, said it is believed the ledgers came from William Long, the dental mechanic who was employed by Crippen and gave evidence at his trial. Cora Crippen's remains were found buried in the London home she shared with her husband; large quantities of the toxic compound hyoscine were found in her body . The cellar at Hilldrop Crescent where police found Cora's remains after searching the property four times . Mr Westwood-Brookes said once Crippen was hanged, there was no need to keep the evidence that convicted him, . He added: 'But it is rare to say the least that primary source evidence from such a spectacular and infamous trial should come on the market.' Crippen fled to Brussels with Le Neve, who was a young typist after his wife mysteriously disappeared in January 1910. The couple then boarded a ferry for Canada but the ship’s Captain Henry George Kendall recognised them and notified police who arrested them when the boat docked in North America. Crippen went on trial in October 1910 and was found guilty by a jury after just 27 minutes of deliberation. He was hanged at Pentonville Prison, London, on November 23, 1910. Police found the remains of Crippen's wife's body buried under the brick floor of the basement of their London home after searching it for the fourth time. Large quantities of the toxic compound hyoscine were found in her remains and the court heard Crippen had bought the drug before the murder from a local chemist. Le Neve was acquitted of being an accessory to murder and emigrated to the U.S on the morning of Crippen’s execution.","Dr Harvey Crippen is one of the most notorious killers in British history .

"By . Tara Brady . A woman struck down by the killer Ebola virus raging in Guinea has spoken of her joy at being 'reborn' after pulling through against the odds. The 27-year-old, giving her name as Fanta, recalled how she hovered for weeks between life and death battling the tropical bug, which has killed more than 100 people this year in the poverty-hit west African nation. 'To hear that I had a disease that could not be cured, I was so afraid... It is as if I have just been reborn,' she told reporters on Thursday outside a treatment centre in the capital Conakry, days after medics had saved her life. A view of gloves and boots used by medical staff, drying in the sun, at a centre for victims of the Ebola virus in Guekedou . 'The way people were looking at me, I knew I had this really dangerous illness but I'm fine now, thank God. I'm cured.' Guinea has been hit by the most severe strain of the virus, known as Zaire Ebola, which has had a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent in past outbreaks, and for which there is no vaccine, cure or even specific treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described west Africa's first outbreak among humans as one of the most challenging since the virus emerged in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is also among the most deadly, with 158 people thought to have been infected and 101 deaths recorded in Guinea and 12 in neighbouring Liberia. A nurse from the 'Doctors without Borders' ('Medecin sans frontieres') medical aid organisation examines a patient in the in-take area at a centre for victims of the Ebola virus in Guekedou . A Guinean doctor working at the Conakry clinic, run by medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, described Fanta as 'very strong' as she returned to thank them for saving her life. 'She has an extraordinary capacity for resistance. If she didn't have that, the treatment could not have saved her. That is why she is still here,' the medic said. Visitors abandoned other patients at the makeshift centre, in the grounds of a hospital, to crowd around Fanta as she spoke to reporters and glimpse close-up the woman they described as the 'miracle that defeated the Ebola virus'.

Onlookers bombarded medical staff with questions about how she had survived, a reporter at the unit witnessed, while traffic police at a nearby crossroads left their posts to get a look at her. Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, says chances of surviving Ebola are greatly improved if patients are kept hydrated and receive treatment for secondary infections. The WHO said on Thursday it was providing emergency training for 70 people who would fan out across Conakry to track people who have had close contact with Ebola patients.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has described west Africa's first outbreak among humans as one of the most challenging since the virus emerged in 1976 . The UN agency is also setting up a special alert and response operation centre within the Guinean health ministry and training staff at Guinea's main hospital and other health facilities. The outbreak spread to the capital, a sprawling port city on the Atlantic coast and home to two million people, after first being reported in the country's remote southern forests. Fanta is among only a handful of Ebola patients in Guinea to have recovered, most of them in Conakry, and she is expected to return to full health.

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . By Phil Casey, Press Association Sport Golf CorrespondentGraeme McDowell will head into the Open Championship buoyed by his first ever successful title defence following a dramatic final round of the Alstom Open de France. McDowell overturned an eight-shot deficit thanks to a brilliant closing 67 despite the wet and windy conditions at Le Golf National, although he also had plenty of help from American Kevin Stadler. Stadler's four-shot overnight lead disappeared with a front nine of 41, but he battled back well with birdies on the 14th and 16th to pull within one of McDowell, who had moved three ahead with his fifth birdie of the day on the 16th. Champion: Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell successfully defended the Open de France title . Comeback: McDowell successfully overturned an eight-shot overnight deficit to win . With McDowell then dropping his only shot of the day on the 18th after finding heavy rough off the tee, Stadler needed to par the 18th to force a play-off but missed from two feet just as McDowell left the recording area to prepare for extra holes. Stadler's closing 76 left him in a tie for second with Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, who dropped five shots in the first four holes but played the remainder in four under for a 72. 'I'm very surprised,' McDowell said after claiming his 10th European Tour title. 'Midway through my second glass of red wine last night, when I was very disappointed with my back-nine performance on Saturday, I really didn't think I'd be a) standing here with an opportunity to be in a play-off and b) with a trophy in my hands. 'I feel very fortunate. Kevin Stadler is a great, great player. I literally gave him that putt on the last green. I didn't expect him to miss that. 'It's not really the way you like to win. I was ready to go for the play-off, but I'll take it and run. I really needed this victory. It's a special one for me. It's pretty timely. There's a busy summer ahead and this a really good kick-start to the summer.' Form: McDowell will hope he can convert his win at Le Golf National into Open Championship glory . Sweet taste of victory: McDowell sprays champagne on course officials after winning the French Open . McDowell has deliberately played a lighter schedule this year - even missing the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth - to leave himself fresher for the second half of the season. 'It's a good decision now, but I have to say myself and my team were starting to question it,' the former US Open champion added on Sky Sports 4. 'But my body has probably never been in as good a shape at this point in the season coming into two major championships, the FedEx Cup play-offs and hopefully the Ryder Cup. 'I'm very proud to defend my first title ever and this is the boost I needed on many fronts, especially the Ryder Cup (the win takes him 10th on the European points list).' McDowell, who held the outright lead after the first round of the Open the last time it was held at Hoylake in 2006, added: 'I was at Hoylake a couple of weeks ago. 'I think it's my type of set-up. You really have to find fairways off the tee and there are big flat greens where you can hole some putts. This is a nice confidence booster and I will be back at Hoylake next Sunday ready to go.' Implosion: American Kevin Stadler crumbled on the final day and blew an eight-shot overnight lead . Poor: Stadler recovered on the back nine but he missed a short par putt to force a play-off . Stadler found himself five clear of the field when playing partner Jaidee got off to a terrible start and local favourite Victor Riu followed a birdie on the first with a double bogey on the second. But the 34-year-old then missed from 18 inches for par on the fourth and four feet on the sixth, before running up a double-bogey six on the next where his ball was only found in the deep rough because an on-course television commentator stood on it. Stadler was allowed a free drop but could only hack the ball a few yards sideways and eventually did well to get up and down from short of the green for a six. A poor chip from left of the eighth green led to another bogey and two more early in the back nine looked to have ended his chances as McDowell picked up shots on the 13th, 14th and 16th.

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . Mohamed Diame pointed to another evening of frustration in front of goal as the main reason for West Ham's Capital One Cup exit on Tuesday night. The Hammers were beaten on penalties by Sky Bet League One side Sheffield United having dominated for most of the 120 minutes leading to the shoot-out. Summer signing Diafra Sakho marked his full debut with the opening goal for Sam Allardyce's side but Sheffield United levelled when Winston Reid scored an unfortunate second-half own goal. Room for improvement: Mohamed Diame (right) is frustrated with West Ham missing opportunities to score . Good start: West Ham players celebrate Diafra Sakho's first goal for the club against Sheffield United . Blades goalkeeper Mark Howard was in inspired form to deny a string of West Ham chances - and kept out Enner Valencia's penalty as the visitors secured a 5-4 shoot-out win. With 23 shots over the course of the night, West Ham will feel they create plenty of opportunities to progress in a competition where they reached the semi-finals last year. It was a similar story on their defeat at home to London rivals Tottenham on the opening day of the Barclays Premier League season and Diame knows that, with the help of new attacking coach Teddy Sheringham, the Hammers must improve their conversion rate. 'It's a shame we didn't win this game at home,' he said. 'But we need to keep going now and focus on the league. We missed chances against Tottenham and didn't win the game, we took our chances against Crystal Palace and we won (3-1). 'We have to keep focused and keep going. We're doing great work with Teddy Sheringham in front of goal, so we have to keep working and try to score goals.' Allardyce's side are back at Upton Park in league action on Saturday when they welcome Southampton to east London, with Diame targeting a second win of the season. 'Every time we play at home we need to play for the three points,' he added. 'It's going to be a big game because Southampton are a good, strong team. I saw them against Liverpool and they played well. 'We need to be ready for this game and make sure we take the three points.'

Sheffield United captain Michael Doyle converted the winning penalty following Valencia's miss - but Howard revealed he was eager to provide the heroics from the spot as well as on his goal-line. 'I do fancy myself to be fair,' he said. 'I wanted to be in the top five (penalty takers) - it is another string to your bow. We all practice penalties in training before cup ties and I'm no different, I like taking them as well as saving them.' Former Arsenal trainee Howard also praised the work done by video analysts at the club to help secure progression into the third round. 'I had done a bit of homework before,' he said. 'Our video guys helped me out and they told me the right way to go for that one. It does help to do your homework. It is a great feeling but, overall with our grit and determination, I felt we deserved to win it. 'The standard of our penalties was excellent. It is totally different for a goalkeeper, as an outfield player you can practice until the cows come home but it is a total different situation under the pressure.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for MailOnline . and Mark Wilson for MailOnline . Callum McGregor will cap a stunning start to his first-team career at Celtic with a promotion to the Scotland squad for next month’s clash with world champions Germany. The 21-year-old has won a rapid promotion from Billy Stark’s Under 21s after four goals in his first seven games for the Parkhead club. Three of his strikes have come in European away games in Reykjavik, Warsaw and Maribor, taking Ronny Deila’s side to within 90 minutes of the Champions League group stage. Caught the eye: McGregor, pictured celebrating against Legia, has impressed in the early weeks of season . Not fazed by the big stage: The 21-year-old has scored three goals in Celtic's away fixtures in Europe . And the midfielder, praised highly by new Celtic boss Ronny Deila last week, will win his reward when Gordon Strachan’s names his squad for the first qualifying game of the Euro 2016 campaign in Dortmund on Monday morning. Meanwhile, McGregor wants the Scottish champions to harness the power of Parkhead against Maribor in their Champions League play-off on Tuesday night. Deila’s men are on the brink of maximising their reprieve and landing a £15million group stage jackpot after McGregor’s goal earned a 1-1 first-leg draw last week away from home. The decisive return match will be the first European outing for Celtic in their home stadium this season, as its use in the Commonwealth Games forced a switch to Murrayfield for previous rounds. Back of the net: McGrgeor, left, wheels away after opening the scoring against Maribor on August 20 . Leading the way: The youngster has been one of Celtic's stand-out players so far this campaign . And McGregor believes an intense atmosphere inside Parkhead – which has four times the capacity of Maribor’s ground – can play a crucial role in unsettling the visitors. ‘The games at Murrayfield had a lot of people there, about 40,000, but it’s still not the same as playing at Celtic Park,’ said the 21-year-old. ‘The crowd gets going on a European night and that puts a wee bit pressure on the away team. ‘Maybe they (Maribor) are not so used to playing in front of big crowds like that. Hopefully we can get the crowd going and spook them a little bit - and get at them right from the start.’ Fans' favourite: The midfielder has represented Scotland at every youth level in the last five years . While fully appreciative of the positive impact of playing on home turf, McGregor believes it also important Celtic don’t adopt a gung-ho attitude and leave themselves too open. Maribor were content to hit on the break in their home leg and look certain to adopt a similar approach in Glasgow. Deila attempted to ensure key players were rested ahead of the potentially season-defining game by making 10 changes for Saturday’s trip to Inverness. Yet the move came at a cost as a shadow side slipped to a 1-0 defeat against the early Premiership pacesetters. Making a name for himself: A group of Inverness players put pressure on McGregor during Saturday's match . ‘The boys are not under any impression that the job is finished against Maribor,’ insisted McGregor, who came on as a second-half substitute against Inverness. ‘We know exactly what we have to do to get the result. All the energy will go into that. ‘We dominated possession in the first half over there but you are always susceptible to the counter attack. We know what we have to do. ‘We will have a lot of the ball and the fans will be on our side as well. We just have to be careful we don’t get caught the other side by throwing too many bodies forward at the one time. ‘We have to play the game and not listen to the crowd too much. They will be really eager for us to go and attack but we have to get a good balance in the team and attack at the right times. I’m sure we’ll be ready for it.’","The 20-year-old will be included in Gordon Strachan's squad for Scotland's friendly against Germany next month .

The integrity of the World Cup was called into question on Tuesday night after Cameroon’s football federation launched a match-fixing investigation into their own players. Prompted by allegations that a convicted fraudster had correctly predicted that Cameroon would lose 4-0 and have a man sent off in their group match against Croatia, the national governing body (FECAFOOT) issued an explosive statement on Tuesday confirming that their ethics committee would probe claims of fraud by ‘seven bad apples’ in their squad.

Pointless: The African side finished bottom of Group A having lost all three games . VIDEO Cameroon to investigate match-fixing claims . The African team lost all three of their . Group A matches but the main focus is on the controversial defeat by . Croatia in Manaus. German magazine Der Spiegel claims to have had a . Facebook conversation with convicted Singaporean match-fixer turned . supergrass Wilson Raj Perumal hours before kick-off. Perumal claimed he had not predicted the result of the match before it began. Perumal . said: ‘At no time did I make reference to four goals being scored or to . a red card being issued. At no time did I suggest that I had any way of . corroborating or substantiating what was meant to be an educated guess . based on my extensive match-fixing experience. ‘I am shocked and . amazed that a respected magazine such as Der Spiegel would go so far as . to fabricate statements by yours truly with the visible aim of stirring . the row over match-fixing.’ But Der Spiegel stood by their . story that led to Cameroon football chief Joseph Owona, president of . FECAFOOT’S normalisation committee, instructing their ethics committee . to investigate. Perumal is a convicted match-fixer from Singapore with offences including forgery, assault and burglary on his record. He was jailed in his home country for match-fixing in 1995 and claims to have tried to fix British games that year. He later ran his empire from a one-bedroom flat in the shadow of Wembley stadium, rigging hundreds of matches around the world and making millions of dollars in the process. In February 2011 he was arrested in Finland and sentenced to two years in prison. WHERE IS HE NOW? After serving a year in a Finnish jail, he was released and turned over to authorities in Hungary, where he was wanted on further match-fixing charges. He is currently being held in jail in Debrecen. WHO DID HE TELL? German journalist Rafael Buschmann wrote, in an article for Der Spiegel, that he communicated with Perumal via a Facebook message. The fixer later said he made the comments after Cameroon’s match against Croatia, but the German magazine say they stand by their story. AND WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL? A 2014 report put together by more than 70 international experts over two years estimates that around $140billion is laundered through illegal sports betting. Accused: Singaporean Wilson Raj Perumal  is alleged to have predicted Cameroon's 4-0 defeat . He said: ‘Recent allegations of fraud around . Cameroon’s three preliminary games, especially Cameroon v Croatia, as . well of the “existence of seven bad apples” do not reflect the values . and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of . Conduct and the ethics of our nation. ‘We wish to inform the general . public that, though not yet  contacted by FIFA in regards to this . affair, our administration  has already instructed its ethics committee . to further investigate these accusations. ‘We are strongly committed . to employ all means necessary to resolve this disruptive matter without . delay.

But . Chris Eaton, the Australian who has worked in sport integrity at FIFA . and Interpol and is now the sports integrity director at the . International Centre for Sport Security, suggested these are serious . allegations if Der Spiegel journalist Rafael Buschmann did receive the . correct prediction from Perumal before the game on June 18.

Mario Mandzukic, the Croatia game was memorable for Benoit Assou-Ekotto . seemingly trying to head-butt team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo. It raises the question of whether the Tottenham full back lost his temper because he suspected something to be wrong. FECAFOOT . had already launched an investigation into that incident but what makes . this controversy more uncomfortable for FIFA is that hosts Brazil were . in Cameroon’s group. FIFA’s security department is also believed to be looking into the claims. In . his conversation with Der Spiegel, Perumal is alleged to have written: . ‘In this team there are seven bad apples.’ Perumal, currently being held . in Hungary and fighting extradition proceedings to face a five-year . prison sentence in his native Singapore, told the magazine he believes . Cameroon manipulated all three group games. Last week FIFA security . director Ralf Mutschke said there had been no suspicious betting . patterns for any match at the tournament. But Eaton believes it would be . wrong to dismiss the story and that FIFA should instead determine, . beyond doubt, Perumal did communicate his accurate prediction before the . game. At the same time he would also question how Perumal was . allowed to communicate with journalists when he could be motivated by . revenge against those who shopped him to the authorities in Finland two . months ago and when he is in prison in Debrecen. Eaton said: ‘If it . is confirmed that the advice from Perumal was made before the match and . is accurate to the overall result and red card, then this allegation . will no doubt be treated extremely seriously by football, governments . and beyond. ‘I understand that he has made other predictions during this  competition that have not proved accurate. ‘The . advice we have received from the legal or so-called regulated sport . betting industry is that there was “no observable suspicious betting on . this match”. ‘But the Cameroon match-fixing case is a grave . allegation with an alleged and strong indication of pre-match knowledge . from a well-known match-fixer.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Investigation after allegations fraudster Wilson Raj Perumal accurately forecast humiliating loss to Croatia .

He added that legal advice . has indicated that ‘there was no observable suspicious betting on this . match’. Eaton . said: ‘If it is confirmed that the advice from Perumal was made before . the match and is accurate to the overall result and red card, then this . allegation will no doubt be treated extremely seriously by football, . governments and beyond.  I understand that he has made other . ‘predictions’ during this competition that have not proved accurate. ‘As . part of the ICSS’s international work in the area of sport integrity . and work alongside betting regulators, operators and monitoring . agencies, the advice we have received from the legal or so-called . ‘regulated’ sport betting industry is that there was “no observable . suspicious betting on this match”. ‘Looking at recent reports, it is my view that Perumal is himself playing a game.  His selective and even the dramatic timing in his exposure of information over time suggests that he has never completely revealed what he knows and which criminal organisations he maintains contact with. 'At the same time, Wilson Raj Perumal is portrayed as someone who is assisting police and prosecutors in Europe.  With the benefit of hindsight, a concerted international and multi-agency debriefing of Perumal when he was first taken into custody in Finland should have been the focus.’ However, Eaton added that the case would be thoroughly investigated: ‘The Cameroon match-fixing case is a grave allegation with an alleged and strong indication of pre-match knowledge from a well-known match-fixer. Therefore, in my view, this case should command a swift, strong and, most importantly, an international and coordinated investigation to clear the air in the interest of football and all concerned.’","FECAFOOT released a statement confirming their ethics committee will probe claims of 'fraud' by seven Cameroon players in all three of their Group A games .

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . Sam Allardyce continues to have his future as West Ham manager questioned but he has found an ally in former Hammers and England striker Sir Geoff Hurst. With fans calling for Allardyce's head towards the end of last season after perceived drab performances and negative tactics, co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold opted against replacing the 59-year-old over the summer. Since then it has been a challenging pre-season for Allardyce and the club - starting when record signing Andy Carroll returned home from a tour of New Zealand for an operation on an ankle injury which has ruled him out for up to four months. Under pressure: Some West Ham fans have turned on Allardyce before the season has even started . In charge: Owners David Gold (left) and David Sullivan (right) decided to keep Allardyce for this season . Loanee Carl Jenkinson also suffered a hamstring injury on his debut, Ravel Morrison has been charged with assault on his ex-girlfriend and her mother and Sullivan has come out with quotes which have undermined Allardyce's position. French side Metz have now accused West Ham of underhand transfer tactics in a move for Diafra Sakho, with a threat of further action against the club lingering. Many fans remain convinced Allardyce is not the man to lead the club forward to their Olympic Stadium move in two years but Hurst believes the Hammers have the perfect manager in place as Allardyce heads into his fourth season in charge at Upton Park. 'I'm very much in the camp of wanting to keep Sam Allardyce,' the England World Cup winner told Sky Sports. Injury worries: Andy Carroll is out for four months as he requires an operation on his ankle . Key man: Carroll looked impressive when fit last year but West Ham will miss his goals . 'We need to improve the team, there's no doubt about that. He hasn't got a great side but the way I see it if he can keep us mid-table then that's a fantastic job. 'It's crazy that there's pressure on Sam Allardyce before the season has started but that's football. 'They haven't had a particularly good pre-season but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Down the years at West Ham, we have had good results after not doing well in pre-season and we've had poor years after making a good start so it doesn't mean a lot.' A narrow 3-2 victory over Sampdoria on Saturday was West Ham's only win inside 90 minutes during a pre-season which took in a tour of New Zealand. Also out: Carl Jenkinson picked up an injury on his West Ham debut during a difficult West Ham pre-season . All in all it has been a pre-season to forget, with Hurst aware that the loss of Carroll will be a hard obstacle to overcome. 'They've had a bit of a blow with Andy Carroll getting injured,' he said. 'They missed him badly last year and I think some of the struggles were down to the fact that the guy didn't play. 'When he got fit towards the end of the season we picked up some good results and got ourselves out of trouble.' Ecuador's World Cup star Enner Valencia and former Birmingham forward Mauro Zarate have been brought in to provide competition in attack, whilst Diego Poyet, Aaron Cresswell and Cheikhou Kouyate have also signed for the Hammers. Those additions have excited Hurst, who said: 'I'm very much for the continuity of keeping him there. It makes sense to me. Stick with it: Geoff Hurst (right) says that his former club should keep Allardyce in charge at Upton Park . 'He's made a couple of signings so we need to see how they fit in and they're still in the market for another striker to replace Andy Carroll.' That hunt for a new forward has seen the Hammers linked with the likes of Samuel Eto'o and Peter Crouch - whilst a bid for Sunderland's Connor Wickham was rejected. Sakho looked destined to move to east London but the 24-year-old who fired the French side to the Ligue 2 title last season will now stay put. Metz accused West Ham of altering their offer at the last minute having allowed Sakho to undergo a medical with the Barclays Premier League side and will assess their options in response to the breakdown of the deal. Fallen through: FC Metz have prevented Sakho from moving to West Ham and complained about Allardyce . 'The English club unilaterally decided to propose a loan deal with an option to purchase instead of a permanent deal, which does not correspond to FC Metz's expectations and contradicts all the terms that had been agreed last week between the two clubs,' a statement on their official website read. 'FC Metz regret this clear lack of respect, which is unacceptable, from West Ham towards FC Metz and also the player. 'As a result, FC Metz reserve the right to approach the international sport court and assert their rights and defend their interests. 'FC Metz had released Diafra Sakho from his professional duties during matchday 1 of the Ligue 1 championship by giving him leave to take a medical in England to complete the last stage of the deal.'","Hammers won only once in 90 minutes during pre-season tour .

"By . Graeme Croser . Inverness Caledonian Thistle remain proudly at the top of the table after capitalising on Ronny Deila’s decision to prioritise Champions League football ahead of Premiership points. With a seat at Europe’s top table at stake - not to mention £15million - the Norwegian coach made 10 changes to the team that drew 1-1 with Maribor last Wednesday. To their credit, Inverness took full advantage, although they required a huge amount of good fortune to score, Eoghan O’Connell’s own goal arriving via some questionable goalkeeping by Lukasz Zaluska. Mix up: Eoghan O'Connell's second half own goal handed the win to Inverness Caledonian Thistle . Inverness CT: Brill, Raven, Warren, Meekings, Shinnie, Watkins (Doran 89'), Tansey, Draper, Williams, Christie (Ross 79'), McKay (Polworth 80'). Subs (not used): Esson, Horner, Tremarco. Goals: Eoghan O'Connell (o.g.) 65' Celtic: Zaluska, Ambrose, O'Connell, Mulgrew, McGeouch, Henderson, Biton, Twardzik (Johansen 46'), Commons, Griffiths (Stokes 68'), Pukki (McGregor 46'). Subs (not used): Denayer, Fasan, Berget, Kayal. Referee: Bobby Madden . Attendance: 5,862 . Deila’s predecessor Neil Lennon did something similar at this same venue two years ago as he prepared for a play-off second leg against Helsingborgs. On that occasion, a teenage striker by the name of Tony Watt marked his first start for the club with a double in a 4-2 victory before going on to make his name with a much more important strike against Barcelona in that season’s group stage. That day, Watt was backed up by the likes of Victor Wanyama and Fraser Forster but Deila decided to leave out virtually all his blue-chip performers, with stand-in captain Charlie Mulgrew the only man left standing after Slovenia. In contrast, this was very much the Inverness A team. League leaders on the back of three excellent results, there was no cause for the Highlanders to change a thing and manager John Hughes selected the same team that rolled over Motherwell last weekend. Hughes would doubtless be happy to send the same XI out every week but perhaps the greatest threat to this continuity is the transfer deadline. Billy McKay has long been the star attraction at the Caledonian Stadium and, as August’s end nears, the striker is attracting covetous glances, not least from long-term admirers Peterborough United. Celebration: Inverness' Rob Draper celebrates a rare victory over the Scottish champions . There was to be no goal here for McKay but it was his menacing presence that forced Zaluska’s error and he provided a selfless shift at the top of a unit that worked hard and knocked the ball around productively. The Northern Irish international might have fancied his chances against a makeshift central defensive pairing of Mulgrew and O’Connell but it was midfielder Greg Tansey who fired off two early salvos, clipping a free-kick into the side-netting and then sending Zaluska scrambling with a 35-yard effort. With Anthony Stokes, Jo Inge Berget and young man of the moment Callum McGregor left on the bench, Celtic started with Kris Commons as the principal striker, supported from wide by Leigh Griffiths and Teemu Pukki. It was a ploy that didn’t last long, with Commons dropping deeper into a pocket where he could get on the ball, create and, when the opportunity arose, take a shot. Celtic weren’t particularly fluent but created plenty of chances from Efe Ambrose’s improvised hook shot to Pukki’s double effort, each saved by the impressive Dean Brill. The Inverness keeper was beaten, though, by a sublime effort from Nir Bitton, but the Israeli midfielder’s curling shot came back off the crossbar. ‘I’m an honest guy - we rode our luck,’ admitted Hughes afterwards. ‘We have Dean Brill to thank for a few saves but to beat Celtic, you need that luck.’ The champions weren’t completely dominant, however. Mulgrew was forced to head clear from under his own bar after Gary Warren’s looping effort beat Zaluska and there was also a claim for a penalty as Ryan Christie went down in the area. Forlorn: It is another poor result in a difficult start for Celtic boss Ronny Deila . Referee Bobby Madden made a similar call in Inverness’s favour just after half-time when McGregor tumbled as he drove into the box. Right or wrong, the moment signalled a change in Celtic’s approach as the youngster’s half-time introduction for Pukki injected some verve into the Celtic attack. Deila’s other interval switch saw Stefan Johansen replace the toiling Filip Twardzik at left-back but, instead of improving things, the Norwegian was one of three Celtic players culpable at the goal. Effective as a central midfielder, Johansen’s discomfort at full-back was exploited by home winger Marley Watkins, who outwitted his opponent before firing the ball across goal. Zaluska underlined his perennial deputy status by palming the ball against O’Connell, who marked his first start of the season with an unwanted goal. In Christie, Inverness have a real talent. Son of former Caley Thistle favourite and manager Charlie, the teenager is easy on the eye whenever the ball is at his feet and he perhaps should have marked this occasion with a goal that would have clinched the points. McKay, who foraged hard without troubling Zaluska, set up Christie with the lay-off but the first-time shot slid past. Substitute Nick Ross had an even better opportunity but opted for placement ahead of power, allowing Zaluska to make a save. Despite Hughes inexplicably describing the last 20 minutes as being ‘like the Alamo’, Celtic’s response was non-existent. ‘The result is different class,’ said the Caley boss. ‘But I wish Celtic all the best on Tuesday night. I really do hope they qualify as it would be good for our game.’","Celtic lose first game of the season away at Inverness Caledonian Thistle .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has defended his decision to use Adnan Januzaj as a holding midfielder in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Sunderland, insisting he saw it as the best thing to do at the time to boost their chances of victory. After Jack Rodwell's header for the hosts had cancelled out Juan Mata's opener in the first half of the Barclays Premier League contest, Januzaj was brought on in the 63rd minute as a replacement for Darren Fletcher, simultaneous to Danny Welbeck coming on for Robin van Persie up front. Out of sync: Winger Januzaj was deployed as a holding midfielder during United's 1-1 draw with Sunderland . Van Gaal opted to put the teenage Belgium winger in the unfamiliar position despite also having the more natural-looking option of Shinji Kagawa at his disposal on the bench. And the manager - who was without the likes of injured midfielders Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera - told reporters: 'It is not usual that we have four injuries in midfield. Every club that has that, has a problem. 'That is why I played Januzaj in midfield, (and) because as a coach I want to win. 'I have said that we need creative passing and I thought Januzaj could provide that. That is the reason.' My way: Louis van Gaal has defended his decision to put the young Belgian in an unfamiliar position . United's next match is Tuesday night's Capital One Cup tie at MK Dons, and Herrera (ankle) will have his condition assessed ahead of the match. Whether the Spaniard makes it or not, it certainly seems Van Gaal will not be experimenting by giving Kagawa a go in the holding midfield slot in the game after the damning assessment he made of the Japan international's previous effort. The Dutchman said: 'Kagawa, I have tried to play him in that position in the United States (in pre-season) and he could not fulfil my wishes and my philosophy. 'We have spoken about that and he is more of a 10. Disappointed: Manchester United's attacking players look dejected after Jack Rodwell's equaliser . 'Juan Mata was playing at 10 and I thought I had to change the other players, which is why I chose to bring on Januzaj. 'It is because of creation. Kagawa can also create, but I asked Adnan to play there because of the lack of midfielders. 'When he played in Belgium, he played in midfield so I asked if he could do it for us. I said to him 'you are on the bench as a midfielder' because I want him to focus. 'He played there and you could see it's not so many times that he's played there. But he did his utmost and I cannot demand more.' Thwarted: Manchester United's Robin van Persie failed to find a way of breaking down Sunderland's defence . Kagawa, an unused substitute both in Sunday's clash and United's campaign-opening 2-1 home defeat to Swansea the previous weekend, has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford and it will be interesting to observe what part, if any, he plays in the MK Dons fixture. Red Devils defender Chris Smalling came off in the first half of the Sunderland encounter with a groin injury and he will, like Herrera, face a late fitness test. It is not expected that new signing Marcos Rojo's work permit situation will be resolved in time for him to make his debut in the tie and it remains to be seen whether fellow defender Rafael will be deemed fit enough to feature. It is understood United are looking to have the British record signing of Real Madrid winger Angel di Maria wrapped up by Tuesday evening, although the expectation is that the deal will not be complete in time for him to be involved at Stadium MK.","Van Gaal brought Januzaj on in the 63rd minute with the score at 1-1 .

But the consequences can be appalling, with many abandoning families while more still end up behind bars themselves. Among them is Toby Young, now 54, from Kansas, whose happy family life was ripped apart after she fell in love with convicted murderer John 'Hooligan' Manard, now 33. 'She decided to take a risk and rescue . dogs and prisoners at the same time by founding Safe Harbor Prison Dogs . in Kansas City in August 2004,' says Isenberg, who interviewed Young for her book. Convict: John 'Hooligan' Manard (left) and mother-of-two Toby Young (right) went on the run together . Home: Both halves of the couple had spent most of their lives in Kansas City or in the local correctional facility . 'The men’s prison at Lansing gave her . security clearance so she could move her mutts in and out and she worked . with prisoners who had good records, helping them train dogs. 'The . programme was so successful that, within 18 months, 800 dogs had been . trained and adopted by Kansas families.' But unbeknown to prison authorities, Young who was married with two grown-up sons, had grown close to Manard and just a year after the affair began, decided to run away with him. On the morning of 12th February 2006, she arrived at the prison driving her white van as normal. But when the van drove out a couple of hours later, it was carrying an extra passenger - Manard, concealed in one of the dog crates in the back. Speaking two years after the escape, Young said that everything she did was coloured by the depression she was suffering, caused by the loss of a child 20 years previously. 'He was just someone I could really talk to,' she told a local TV channel. 'We could talk about anything. He was smart. I was very unhappy, and I was so depressed.' Remote: The couple drove 700 miles to a hidden log cabin near Chattanooga in Tennessee . Entertainment: Manard spent his days watching convict film O Brother, Where Art Thou? Carrying an overnight bag containing $25,000 . in cash, two of her husband’s . semi-automatic pistols, black hair dye, a razor, books, videos, puzzles and sex . toys, she and Manard drove 700 miles into Tennessee where a remote log cabin awaited them. 'In Alpine, . Tennessee, the couple settled into a life of domesticity as well as . sexual experimentation,' explains Isenberg. 'Manard played music from the jailbreak film O . Brother, Where Art Thou? and tried to make new identity papers. 'He . watched porn DVDs and used a PlayStation while Young did puzzles, read . pop fiction, and wrote in her journal. Sometimes she dressed up, and . the couple experimented with whips and sex toys.' But less than three weeks after they escaped, the couple's log cabin was surrounded by police and the two were arrested. Manard had 10 years added to his already lengthy sentence. Young was given 15 months and was eventually released in May 2008, returning home to be handed a divorce by her husband and attempt to rebuild her relationship with her sons. 'Some days it took all my energy not to break apart a razor and cut my wrists in my room,' she told KMBC ahead of her release. 'The women [who have relationships with prisoners] are emotionally damaged but probably no more than most of us,' comments Isenberg. 'They are looking for a partner who makes them feel whole, which is kind of what all of us do, although I would hope that a healthier person would seek someone who could live a real life in the real world. 'A relationship with a man in prison is not real in that its parameters are controlled by the prison rules and the prison walls - it’s not the real world.' And yet despite the risks and the unreality, women like Young and like Kate Winslet's Labor Day character Adele Wheeler continue to pursue relationships with convicts. 'One that stands out is a woman who was a . juror on a murder trial,' says Isenberg. 'She helped convict a man and then after visiting him in prison, she fell for him, left her husband and children, . job and extended family, and moved to live near the prison. Damaged: Like Labor Day's Adele Wheeler, many of the women Isenberg interviewed were damaged . 'Another . story that shocked me was a young woman who . fell in love with her grandmother’s murderer.' So why do these doomed romances continue to happen? Isenberg has several theories but says one standout similarity is that nearly all of the women involved were abuse victims, whether in previous relationships or during childhood. 'My theory is that for them, relationships with convicted murderers behind bars are ""safe"",' she explains. 'The men in prison can't hurt these women who have been so abused and therein lies their appeal, or at least part of it. 'Also, men in prison for life have a lot . of time on their hands and can devote many, many hours to these . relationships,' she adds. 'They write long love letters, love poems, paint pictures and so on, showering the women with the kind of romantic attention that just is . not that common outside prison walls.' Attention that damaged women such as Toby Young and Labor Day's Adele Wheeler just can't resist - whoever it comes from.

"By . Kate Battersby . The rocketing rise of budget German supermarket Lidl continues, with price-busting groceries the least of it. Not content with luring bargain- conscious middle-class shoppers away from the bigger supermarkets with cut-price lobster, champagne and posh deli hams, they’ve also entered the worlds of fashion and beauty. Three years ago, their £4 perfume Suddenly Madame Glamour outshone Chanel’s £61 Coco Mademoiselle in a trial. Then last year, beauty experts raved over the brand’s £1.99 BB cream. Until now the supermarket has limited itself to basic underwear and vests. But today the brand’s Esmara range — boasting jeans, shirts, knitwear and a stand-out ‘leather’ jacket for £15 — arrives in all 600 stores nationwide. Described as ‘more current and on-trend, as much about quality as affordability,’ Lidl say it is ‘a natural progression for us’. Natural for Lidl, maybe, but for its shoppers? As a 50-year-old woman keen on a bargain, I decided to find out . . . Scroll down for video . GREAT SKIRT, SHAME ABOUT THE JUMPER . Denim skirt £5.99, sweater £5.99 . In general, Lidl’s tops are better than anything the chain has come up with for the bottom half. But this jumper is not so much roomy as shapeless, exacerbated by the unflattering slash neckline. While there is nothing wrong with clothing that IS cheap, it mustn’t LOOK cheap. However, the denim skirt is pleasingly faded. The fit is good, and while too short for me to wear bare-legged, I’d happily team it with a polo neck, tights and boots for autumn/winter. SOPHISTICATED CHIFFON FOR ONLY £5.99 . Skirt £5.99, chiffon blouse £5.99 . At first glance, this outfit looks promising: the £5.99 skirt has a trendy abstract print and the silky shirt looks like it costs far more than £5.99. When on, it’s a different story. The skirt looks as if it would lose all shape in the seat with just a few wears. But the shirt has possibilities. Lidl describes it as chiffon, but it’s very definitely synthetic, not silk. Yet it hangs well and feels quite pleasant. The tiny buttons are fiddly, but at this incredible price, how picky can you be? HATE THE JEANS, LOVE THE SHIRT . Maroon jeans £6.99, denim shirt £5.99 . These jeans are available in grey, blue wash, navy or maroon and presumably are all as horrid as each other. The shape could not flatter anyone, and they quickly become slack in all the wrong places. Not a patch on Primark’s excellent range of jeans. But the soft denim shirt is a real find. I expected the fabric to gather in bulging folds, and I was wrong. Once on, it becomes apparent how well-tailored the fitted shape is, with no unsightly gaping at the cleavage. BRILLIANT £14.99 BIKER . Jacket £14.99, jeans £6.99, blouse £5.99 . Without any doubt, the absolute star of Lidl’s range is this biker-style jacket that costs an astonishing £14.99. No, you would never mistake it for leather, but not many will spot that it is 100 per cent viscose. Yes, I’ll be running out to buy it today. But the jeans? The £6.99 price tag doesn’t look such a bargain once they’re on. They achieve the trick previously unique to Ann Widdecombe’s clothes — both too big and too small at the same time. THE VERDICT . Try to pair almost any piece from the range with another and you run into a problem — head-to-toe Lidl is not a great look. But we have long learned to mix and match budget fashion gems such as the biker jacket. And the white chiffon blouse, denim skirt and denim shirt are all useful staples at an extraordinary price.","Esmara range boasts jeans, shirts, knitwear and a leather jacket .

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . A new survey from Birds Eye revealed that  53 per cent of us pick out foods we don't like from a meal . It appears that when it comes to food Britain is still home to some pretty fussy eaters. According to a new poll anchovies are Britain's most hated taste followed by chicken livers and olives. The survey conducted by Birds Eye found that despite the fact that 41 per cent of Britons would describe themselves as foodies, one in five will go to extreme lengths to avoid flavours they dislike. More than half (53 per cent) admit picking food they don’t like out of their meal, while one in five (22 per cent) secretly feed the offending food to their dog. Most Brits (66 per cent) are brave enough to give strange food a go at least once. However, one in five (21 per cent) admit having more than seven foods on their 'hate' list. The most hated on the list were anchovies with the salty fish being detested by almost half the nation (44 per cent). Other foods featuring in the top 10 most hated include olives (39 per cent), mushrooms (15 per cent) and salami (20 per cent). Although we may be a nation of fussy eaters we are certainly are a polite population. More than half Britons (52 per cent) admitted they've forced themselves to tuck into food they dislike because they didn't want to upset their host. However, it appears that the women are the more compassionate sex with three-quarters of them (78 per cent) choosing not to cause any hassle when served food they dislike as they don’t want to spoil the time they are spending with their friends and family, compared to only 57 per cent of men. Scroll down for video . Prime suspects: The top three most hated foods include the salty fish - anchovies and olives . A further one in 11 women (nine per cent) have even  gone as far as to stow food away in their handbag to avoid upsetting their host and disrupting a meal with family and friends. Though it appears that there is a good reason for this. Women may be the more considerate guests but they are also the fussiest. More than a quarter of the women polled (27 per cent) admitted they dislike seven or more common types of food, compared to just 16 per cent of men. A third of men (30 per cent) say there aren't any types of food that they particularly dislike, compared to only 19 per cent of women. Cheryl Calverley, general marketing manager at Birds Eye, said that the research shows that although we may love our food we all have our likes and dislikes . 'Despite seeming to be a nation of foodies, the research shows that everyone has their individual tastes.' 1) Anchovies (44 per cent) 2) Chicken Liver (41 per cent) 3) Olives (39 per cent) 4) Black pudding (39 per cent) 5) Blue Cheese (38 per cent) 6) Goats Cheese (27 per cent) 7) Avocado (24 per cent) 8) Brussel Sprouts (24 per cent) 9) Salami (20 per cent) 10) Mushrooms (15 per cent)","A new survey has revealed the foods we Brits detest the most .

"By . Alison Smith-squire For The Daily Mail . With his smiling mother and aunt, this is little Fionan Terry in one of the first portraits of his extraordinary family. But the happy picture belies the emotional roller-coaster the two sisters have endured to bring him into the world. For not only is Ellie Fairfax his aunt, she is also his surrogate mother – stepping in to carry the baby after her sister learnt treatment for cervical cancer would leave her infertile. Scroll down for video . Happy family: Siobhan Terry, left, and surrogate mother and sister Ellie Fairfax with three-month-old Fionan . Adorable: He is biologically Ellie's son but she says she only ever thought of him as Siobhan's baby . Siobhan Terry, 31, longed for another child to make her family complete, but was told she would never be able to give her daughter Saoirse, two, a brother or sister. Thanks to the remarkable selflessness of Miss Fairfax, though, she is now the delighted mother of Fionan. He was born three months ago weighing 6lb 4oz after a four-hour labour. For the first fortnight after Fionan’s birth, Miss Fairfax, 33, went to live with her sister and husband Dean, 51, to help the baby settle in. Yesterday Miss Fairfax, a trainee cardiac physiologist, said: ‘Although Fionan is biologically mine, from the moment he was conceived to the magical time I held him for the first time, I only ever thought of him as Siobhan’s baby. ‘So it was never hard to let him go to her. I just felt relieved when he was born that he was healthy and delighted to see him bring Siobhan and Dean so much joy.’ Mrs Terry said: ‘Words cannot express how much I can ever thank Ellie for what she’s done. Dean and I are simply overjoyed to be parents again and Saoirse already dotes on her little brother.’ The sisters, from Beckenham, south-east London, are the eldest of four and have always been close. Selfless: Ellie stepped in when Siobhan (right with husband Dean and daughter Saoirse) was left infertile . The labour: Ellie pictured in hospital on the day. She found out she was pregnant on Siobhan's birthday . There are two types of surrogacy. One is ‘straight’ (or traditional), where a surrogate uses her own eggs and is artificially inseminated with the father’s sperm. However, the majority of cases in the UK are host (or gestational) surrogacy, where IVF is carried out with the eggs and sperm of the intended parents. The embryo is then implanted into the surrogate mother. Under English law, the legal mother of the child is the surrogate. The intended mother is not recognised as a parent, even if she is the child’s biological mother. After six weeks the ‘parents’ can apply for a Parental Order that will give them full parental rights over the child. But their bond grew stronger when Mrs Terry was diagnosed with cancer in December 2012 after a routine smear test. She said: ‘Knowing I urgently needed radiotherapy and chemotherapy was devastating. But Dean and I had hoped to have a sibling for Saoirse. 'So it was a double blow when doctors broke the news that saving my life would destroy my eggs and leave my uterus too scarred to carry a baby.’ When she told her family the heartbreaking news, her sister, who has no children of her own, instantly volunteered to carry a baby for her. They bought an artificial insemination kit and after two months of trying using publican Mr Terry’s sperm, Miss Fairfax became pregnant. She said: ‘It was Siobhan’s birthday and telling her I was pregnant was the most wonderful gift to give her.’ Miss Fairfax, who gave birth in a birthing pool, said: ‘Siobhan cut the cord and it felt completely natural for her to take him in her arms for a cuddle. 'I’ll never forget seeing her kiss him for the first time and seeing then how much a new baby meant to her.’ She added: ‘While Fionan will always be a special nephew, I was happy to let Siobhan and Dean deal with the nappies and sleepless nights while I went back to my studies.’ The sisters are telling their story to raise awareness of cervical cancer.","Siobhan Terry, 31, was left infertile after cervical cancer treatment .

"By . Claire Bates . and Nick Enoch . and Hannah Roberts . Craig White died from tuberculosis after suffering crippling headaches for a week . A student has died after  contracting a rare form of tuberculosis. Craig White, 21, suffered from intense headaches and nausea in the months leading up to his death. The aspiring sports journalist, from Boston in Lincolnshire, initially dismissed his symptoms as side effect of the steroids he was taking for Crohn’s disease, his family said. When his condition worsened after a meal with friends on December 5, he was admitted to Boston's Pilgrim Hospital two days later but died on December 12. Mr White, an aspiring sports . journalist, had tweeted friends just weeks before he died asking if . anyone knew of a pill more effective than paracetamol, as his 'head . feels like it's going to explode!' The Health Protection Agency said a . post-mortem examination this morning identified disseminated . tuberculosis - a rare form of the disease - as the provisional cause of . death. Further . investigations into Mr White's case will now be carried out by Professor . Robert Forrest, the coroner for South Lincolnshire. Adjourning . the inquest, Professor Forrest said: 'There are still a lot of details . we need to establish into the tragic death of Craig Adam White. This may . take a few months.' The . HPA said it was likely he contracted TB by breathing in infected . droplets from a sufferer several months ago as it takes a long time for . symptoms to develop. TB, which was rife in Britain until . the 1950s, is an increasing and worrying problem in urban areas. Rising . immigration has seen a surge in cases in the last 20 years. Cases dropped from 50,000 a year in the 1950s to 5,000 in the 1980s. Last year there were just over 9,000 cases. London has the highest rate of infection, followed by Birmingham. Seventy . per cent of cases occur among recent migrants to Britain from countries . where the disease remains prevalent such as the Indian sub-continent . and sub-Saharan Africa. Craig White, 21, had suffered from crippling . headaches for weeks preceding his death. A post-mortem examination found . disseminated tuberculosis as the provisional cause of death . The last tweet sent by Craig White. He died two weeks later . It is not known whether Mr White had recently travelled abroad. The HPA is now offering screening for the infection to his friends at the University of Lincoln. Mr . White was a keen supporter of Manchester City football club and had a . fan blog. He was in his third year of his journalism degree. After . his death, his girlfriend Laurie Caumette, who visited him in hospital, . tweeted: 'Can't believe I'll never see you smile again or hear the . sound of your voice and hear you laugh. I'm going to miss you so much.' The . official Manchester City twitter feed said: 'All at #MCFC send our . condolences to the friends & family of City fan & @mcfcview . blogger @cwhiteuk who sadly passed away recently.' In a statement issued by the HPA, Dr Katie Geary said cases of disseminated TB were rare but not unheard of in the UK. Dr Geary said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this sad time. 'As part of normal practice, all . close contacts considered to be at risk of contracting the disease will . be offered screening to see if they’ve been exposed to the infection.' She . added: 'Exposure to the infection through contact with someone who has . the illness does not mean that an individual will go on to develop TB. 'Transmission occurs through coughing . of infectious droplets and usually requires prolonged close contact . with an infectious case.' Disseminated . TB develops in the small number of infected people whose immune systems . do not successfully contain the primary infection. Those who take immune-suppressing medications are at higher risk for disseminated TB, because of their weaker immune systems. Disseminated . disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it . does not occur until years after you become infected. Low doses of immune system suppressants are often administered for Crohn's disease.Steroids are known to suppress the immune system. The disease mainly affects the lungs, where it can cause calcium deposits which make it difficult to breathe. It can also travel to other parts of the body including the brain, kidneys, bones and joints. Symptoms . can include fever and night sweats (both sometimes experienced by . Crohn's sufferers), an unexplained prolonged cough, unexplained weight . loss or blood in phlegm. However, . many people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the . bacteria remain in the body, they are not infectious. Craig's girlfriend Laurie Caumette, who visited him in hospital, tweeted: 'Can't believe I'll never see you smile again or hear the sound of your voice and hear you laugh. I'm going to miss you so much.' Tributes to Mr White were posted on Twitter, including one from Manchester City FC . It is curable with a six-month course of antibiotics, but a drug-resistant form can develop if the course is not completed. Left untreated it can prove fatal. A University of Lincoln spokesman said: 'We now know that Craig died as a result of developing tuberculosis. 'Craig was a much-loved member of the Lincoln School of Journalism and the whole university community has been deeply saddened by his untimely death. 'There is no reason to believe there is a risk to the health of members of the university community.' Mail Online has contacted United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust who said they would release a statement. The inquest into Mr White's death was opened and adjourned earlier today.","Craig White, from Boston, Lincs, suffered from headaches and nausea but assumed it was linked to his medication for Crohn's disease, his family said .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . The long track of a rectangular, tumbling boulder has on Mars has been captured in incredible detail by a space probe. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) discovered the trail left behind after a SUV-sized rock rolling down a Martian hill. Analysis of the rock's shadow suggests that the boulder is about 20ft tall (6 metres) and 11.5ft wide (3.5 metres). The boulder's trail down the slope is about one-third of a mile (about 500 metres) long. The trail has an odd repeating pattern, suggesting the boulder could not roll straight due to its shape, according to Nasa . The giant boulder, captured using MRO's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, ended its roll pointed upright. Nasa doesn't yet know what dislodged the boulder, but recent speculation suggests it may have been due to a meteor striking one of the larger craters. 'The boulder's trail down the slope is about one-third of a mile (about 500 metres) long,' the space agency said. 'The trail has an odd repeating pattern, suggesting the boulder could not roll straight due to its shape.' A path resembling a dotted line from the upper left to middle right of this image is the track left by an irregularly shaped, oblong boulder as it tumbled down a slope on Mars before coming to rest in an upright position . The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in 2005 on a search for evidence that water persisted on the surface of red planet for a long period of time. In its survey of the red planet, MRO has increased tenfold the number of spots surveyed close-up. One of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's cameras is the largest ever flown on a planetary mission.  While previous cameras on other Mars orbiters could identify objects no smaller than a bus, this camera will be able to spot something as small as a dinner table. In October, MRO have a close Mars' close encounters with a comet set to fly by the red planet, giving it a rare opportunity to take images of the space rock.

"By . Victoria Woollaston for MailOnline . The WorldView-3 spacecraft (illustration pictured) identifies objects as small as 1 foot (31cm) from an orbit of 383 miles (617km) Orbiting above Earth is a satellite so powerful, it can identify the number of chickens, manhole covers and even parking spaces around the world. DigitalGlobe's WorldView-3 spacecraft was launched into space from a military base in California on Wednesday - and is so high-resolution, it can pick out objects as small as 1 foot (31cm). The 18ft-long (5.4 metres), 8ft-wide (2.4 metres) satellite should last for at least seven years, but experts claim the satellite could be functional for almost double that time. WorldView-3 is also designed to peer through fog and smoke to image Earth's surface in detail, using an on-board instrument called CAVIS - short for Cloud, Aerosol, water Vapor, Ice, Snow. This will help the satellite get a sharp view of the ground even if there is a fire, dust clouds, soot and smog. It is powered by solar panels, which extend the length and width of the satellite to 19ft long and 23ft wide (5.8 by 7 metres), and it weighs 6,200 lbs (2,812 kg).

"By . Harriet Hernando . If you’ve ever marvelled at the wonder of hand warmers – those hard flat packs that heat up when you bend them - then this video will amaze you. A scientist from the University of Toronto, Canada, is filmed putting his hand in a jar of hot ice, or molten sodium acetate, so it crystallises around his fingers. In a matter of seconds, the man's fingers are coated in a thick layer of ice. But instead of being cold, the scientist explains that his hand is actually quite warm, ‘like a hot bath’. Frozen: The scientist's hands are coated in a thick layer of hot ice, or molten sodium acetate. Because the ice is in fact warm, he is able to shake the crystals off . ‘Hot ice’ is created using sodium acetate, which is a salt created from the reaction between sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, and acetic acid, or vinegar. When this reaction occurs, sodium acetate appears to freeze like ‘ice’ as the cold solution turns from liquid to solid. This process is exothermic, meaning that the solid structure is warm to the touch. Solutions of sodium acetate are used in certain types of hand-warmers. When a metal button is pressed inside the plastic pouch containing the solution, it releases chemicals that starts the reaction. This causes the solution to crystallise, and this reaction generates heat. Eventually he’s left with a block of ice stuck to his hand, but he’s able to break free because the crystals are still soft, ‘like ice cream’. Explaining the process on YouTube channel NurdRage, the scientist, who does not give his name, said: ‘This works because the substance is not ""ice"" as in water, but a different substance called sodium acetate trihydrate. ‘Normally solid sodium acetate was melted into a liquid that was then supercooled to below its melting point. ‘In this state, adding nucleation sites, like the crystals on my hand, rapidly causes the rest of the sodium acetate to crystallise.’ The incredible video has been watched almost three million times. ‘Hot ice’ is created using sodium acetate, which is a salt created from the reaction between sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, and acetic acid, or vinegar. Hot ice is created using sodium acetate, which is a salt created from the reaction between sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, and acetic acid, or vinegar. When a reaction with acid occurs, sodium acetate appears to freeze like ‘ice’ as the cold solution turns from liquid to solid (pictured) During reactions, sodium acetate appears to freeze like ‘ice’ as the cold solution turns from liquid to solid. This process is exothermic, meaning that the solid structure is warm to the touch. Solutions of sodium acetate are used in certain types of hand-warmers. When a metal button is pressed inside the plastic pouch containing the solution, it releases chemicals that starts the reaction. This causes the solution to crystallise, and this reaction generates heat.","A scientist from the University of Toronto placed his hand in hot ice .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Would you be willing to share a taxi with a stranger, if it meant cutting the cost? That's the idea behind UberPool, the latest scheme from taxi firm Uber, which lets users share a journey with another person who is requesting a ride along a similar route. Cars are booked in the standard way, but if there is a match, the app will notify the user of the other rider’s first name. At the end of the journey, the fare is then split between both passengers. UberPool (screengrab pictured) lets users share rides and fares with strangers travelling on the same route. Cars are booked in the standard way, but if there is a match, the app notifies the user of the other rider’s first name. The driver will then collect the first passenger, before collecting the second . ‘Since the early days of Uber, we’ve been excited about the idea of providing transportation so inexpensive and reliable, people can actually sell their cars,’ explained the company in a blog post. There are already similar services that let people share journeys with strangers in the UK. For example, BlaBla Car as well as goCarShare connect drivers travelling to a certain destination or event, with people looking for a lift. Prices are set by the driver and a journey from Bristol to London, for example, starts at around £8. Both drivers and passengers can request lifts. BlaBla Car connects members of the service who set up an account. Meanwhile, goCarShare links with Facebook to connect members of the social network. ‘Today, we’re announcing a bold experiment straight from the Uber Garage that we believe will be another important step toward that vision, and we’re calling it UberPool.’ The feature is being rolled out immediately in private beta, and is only currently available in San Francisco. One of the first firms to join the scheme is Google. Throughout the beta, the firm said it will be training more drivers and getting feedback from initial riders taking part in the scheme. It will then expand the beta to all Uber customers across San Francisco on 15 August. ‘This is also a bold social experiment,’ continued the firm. ‘There’s the interaction between riders in an UberPool - should they talk to each other? When is that cool and when is it, well, annoying? The feature is being rolled out immediately in private beta, and is only currently available in San Francisco. If the beta is successful, Uber has said it will launch in other areas. Last July, Uber made it possible for friends to split fares through the app (pictured) on any journey .

Last July, Uber made it possible for friends to split fares through the app. To do so, they request a ride, select Split Fare and find their friend in the user list. The other friend has to confirm they are happy to split the fare, and it is divided exactly between the number of people in the car. Uber launched in in California in 2010 and has grown from 35 cities last summer to 100 in April. This includes London, New York, Sydney, Mumbai, Moscow, Tokyo, Barcelona, and more. On average, uberX already costs 40 per cent less than a typical taxi. The firm has been criticised by black cab drivers for being anti-competitive and undercutting prices, which they claim is threatening their businesses.","UberPool lets users share rides with strangers travelling the same route .

It’s a bar as well, so you can go and eat yummy food then relax . on the terrace with a few drinks. Tibu. I’ve DJ'd here a few times and it’s a great venue playing a mixture of house, R 'n' B and hip hop. Its pretty big and open late so if it’s a big night you're after i’d suggest going here. Nikki Beach. This is such a lovely and chic place to hang out, its a little bit away . from the port which isn't a bad thing. It has a chilled out day vibe . and then when it gets dark the party starts with dancers and . entertainers and its really cool to dance the night away under the . stars. Pangea.

Speaking about her 26-piece range, the model and DJ told MailOnline: 'It is full of key pieces and items you would see me wearing. I'm really excited for people to see it.' The designer, who models the whole range herself, explained that she's added a lot more colour and softer fabrics, as well as sharp tailoring to the collection. Keen walker: Lauren enjoys taking time out to walk along the beach and explore the local area . The tropical-inspired range features an eclectic mix of dresses, jumpsuits, skirts and co-ord sets. Speaking about her inspiration, she said: 'I always look to catwalks for inspiration and to fashion bloggers and some celebrities but once I see something I like, I tend to give it a little twist of my own, we don't want to be a copy of anything else out there.' Lauren, who cites her favourite designers as Balenciaga, Balmain, Celine and Saint Laurent and loves to shop at Zara, Oasis, River Island and Missguided on the high street, says she finds it hard to describe her personal style. 'It's hard to describe as I tend to chuck different styles together and if I like something I will wear it. I love keeping it chic with an edgy twist,' she said. Walking. I love to go walking so I often put my trainers on and just head out of the hotel on a little wonder and see what’s around. There’s a whole other world just away from the port that is so cool.Eating out. I love, love, love going for dinner on holiday. Sitting outside with a glass of wine is a great way to kickstart your night. Marbella has so many cool restaurants to choose from. La Sela is lovely.Pool Parties. Marbs has a lot of well known pool parties, Ocean Club has a big Champagne Spray party once a month which is a must to experience, i still find it mad that people spend a fortune on champagne to just spray it all over each other! Take a boat out for the day. Hire a boat with some friends, take a picnic and just have a chilled out day on the water.Shopping. The port has a lot of designer boutiques as well as a lot of high street shops so you can get the best of both. Its also a really pretty walk along the port and you can have a nosey at all the amazing yachts. A killer wardrobe. My . luggage allowance is always overweight as I find it impossible to pack . light! I take a mix of looser fabrics and try to add in a little more . colour. Some chic flat sandals. I've scrapped the wedges in the daytime now and much prefer a more . relaxed look at the beach or at a pool party so I'm always on the look . out for flats with a either embellishment details or metallic finishes.SPF. As I've got older I really understand about sun damage so I'm a factor . 30 girl from now on. I tend to get bored if I sunbathe for too long as . I'd rather be doing something active. But you still need to remember to . cover yourself from head-to-toe in suncream.Some fabulous friends. A holiday is not complete with out some great company. I was lucky to . have my best friend Vas with me in Marbs recently and he makes me laugh . so much. A holiday is a time to relax and chill so I love travelling . with people who aren't uptight and are happy to go with the flow.Hair Extensions and Hairpieces. I own my own brand of hair extensions and pieces called Hair Rehab . London and they are a life saver on holiday. No one wants to waste their . time blow-drying . their hair and when you're away it tends to go a little bit frizzy so I . take a selection of extensions and pieces that just clip in and out.

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Gone are the days when women constantly worried about their looks, a new study suggests. For the modern British woman is now so confident in her appearance that she thinks she looks five years younger than she really is. Most women do not believe they look old until the age of 46, and feel confident about their appearance into their fifties and beyond, according to a survey. Three-quarters of the 2,000 women surveyed said they looked five years younger than their real age, mostly thanks to a youthful complexion. One in ten respondents believed they looked a decade younger than they really were, while a third said they would happily embrace growing old. The study, commissioned by cosmetics brand Lancome Advanced Genifique, suggested that some women - around 10 per cent - were concerned about ageing as early as their twenties. Scroll down for video . One in ten respondents believed they looked a decade younger than they really were, the study found . Nearly 40 per cent said their concerns began in their thirties. The average age when the worries started, however, was 46. One in five women said concerns about looking old had started in their 50s or 60s, suggesting older women are more content with their looks than they were in their youth. Respondents said the secret to eternal youth included a happy marriage, avoiding getting sunburnt, using a good moisturiser, good genes and eating five pieces of fruit a day. Regular haircuts, daily exercise, religiously cleansing, toning and moisturising, good eye cream and never smoking were also crucial in the fight against ageing, they said. A glass of wine at the weekend, surrounding themselves with young people and having well-behaved children were among the other answers given. British actress Helen Mirren, 68, was the celebrity most admired for her youthful appearance, followed by comedian Joanna Lumley, 68, Pretty Woman star Julia Roberts, 46, and singing sensation Lulu, 65. Italian and French women were considered the most likely nationalities to retain a youthful appearance, followed by those from Scandinavia. Women from Russia, Germany and Ireland scored the lowest. Nearly half of respondents said they spent up to £60 a year on cosmetics which they hoped would make them look younger, 38 per cent spend between £60 and £150 and 12 per cent spent between £150 and £250. Three per cent of women said they spent more than £250 a year on skincare products aimed at beating the clock.","Modern woman believes she looks five years younger than she really is .

Footage shows the Gentoo penguin spotting the camera and sprinting over before giving it an inquisitive peck. Fortunately the camera is too big to swallow, so the penguin waddles off in search of something edible. The footage was captured on Cuverville Island in Antarctica, home to a large Gentoo penguin colony. Alex Cowan, on-board geologist on the adventure tours vessel MS Expedition, which is owned and operated by G Adventures, left the camera buried in the snow.

Officials said July was Heathrow's busiest month ever with 6.97 million passengers passing through its terminals, up 0.5 per cent from July 2013. It was a solid month for Gatwick, which set a new record for monthly traffic with 4.1 million travellers, up six per cent from the same month a year ago. Ready for takeoff: Heathrow Airport said July was its busiest month ever, with 6.97 million passengers . Gatwick airport set a new record for monthly traffic with 4.1 million travellers in July . Officials said nearly 240,000 people travelled through Heathrow on 27 July, making it the airport’s busiest day ever. Heathrow and Gatwick are celebrating their travel numbers and using them to tout their expansion plans over the other. The airports continue to spar in a bitter campaign to convince the government – and the public – to endorse their proposals. Heathrow had its busiest day ever on 27 July when 240,000 people travelled through its terminals . Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said Air China has doubled its routes to Beijing, calling it a vote of confidence for the airport as he took a shot at Gatwick. He said: ‘It’s also recognition that despite other UK airports having spare capacity, only Heathrow can deliver daily, direct flights to emerging economies that will help Britain win in the global race for growth. Gatwick can’t, Heathrow can.’ Nick Dunn, Gatwick’s Chief Financial Officer, claimed an expanded Heathrow would be bad for the consumer. He said: ‘Building a third runway at Heathrow will diminish the choice available to British passengers, making it more expensive to go on holiday, to travel for business and to export goods and services. ‘We support competition, reduced fares and two world-class London airports serving the UK as a whole.’ Gatwick's increase was due to a spike in travel between European and transatlantic destinations . Gatwick’s bump was largely due to a 10.5 per cent increase in European traffic, with the business routes between Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam performing well. North American travel jumped by 6.6 per cent thanks to the introduction of Norwegian Air Shuttle’s low-cost transatlantic flights to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale. Heathrow reported increased travel between Mexico (15.4 per cent), China (10.4 per cent) and India (7.6 per cent), and a 7.8 per cent bump in cargo traffic.","July was Heathrow's busiest month ever with 6.97 million passengers .

Wearing an array of colorful outfits and striking a pose, he looks like a happy puppy. Scroll down for video . Popular pup: Ray's owners created a Facebook page dedicated to him in March, and since then he's received over 6,500 likes. They use the account to share pictures of Ray - often dressed up in funny outfits . Born this past December, Ray was the only boy in the litter with four lively sisters. At first, he seemed more timid than his sisters which led a vet to eventually discover that he was blind. But he insists on his Facebook page that that's no reason to feel sorry for him. 'I can run and play and do everything else other dogs that can see do!' Ray 'says' on his Facebook page. The original story about Ray on Buzzfeed, posted last week, has now been viewed over 220,000 times. Don't feel sorry for me!: Ray doesn't let his blindness keep him from living life like a normal dog . His blindness, however, was a bad omen at first since blind dogs have a much harder time finding the right family for adoption. 'My life then became a waiting game as to if I was ever going to find a home or not,' Ray's Facebook page says. 'Luckily my dad found out about me before it was too late, and saved my life!' Lucky dog: Even though adoption rates are much lower for blind dogs, Ray was able to find a family that fit . Shut eye: Napping seems to be a common theme in the pictures posted on Ray's Facebook page . It's a dog's life: Just like any other puppy, Ray likes chewing on toys and whatever else he comes across . Ray now lives in Boston with two big brothers and a big sister, the family's other dogs Harley, Jack, and Maggie. In March, Ray got his own Facebook page, which his owners use to post pictures of Ray dressed up in silly outfits, taking baths and playing with toys. Since the page was created, the internet has fallen in love with the sightless dog - he has over 6,500 likes. Love for Ray spread off Facebook where he was voted a  'dog of the week' at Modern Dog Magazine's website last month with over 3,000 votes. Hometown fans in Boston have created a petition on ipetitions.com vying to give Ray the chance to drop the puck at a Bruins hockey game.

The bold bird manages to evade staff at the Boulders Beach Lodge and Restaurant, near Cape Town, to the delight of guests . The unexpected visitor was an African Penguin, one of 112,000 of the birds alive in the world . The animal, also known as a Jackass penguin due to its donkey-like call, is part of the renowned Boulders Beach African Penguin Colony, one of many groups that live on the country's southern coasts. Guests at the the Boulders Beach Lodge and Restaurant can be heard in hysterics as the bird cleverly evades staff by waddling in a circle around a coffee table. At one point the curious penguin stops in his tracks, sparking a stand-off with gawping members of staff at the guest-house, situated near Simon's Town, south of Cape Town. Checking out: Staff finally manage to push the penguin back outside after a little gentle coaxing with a broom . In one last effort to stay in the restaurant, the penguin attempts to dart under a different table but this time is eventually shown the door after some gentle coaxing with a broom. The unexpected guest is part of a 3,000-strong colony that live just metres from the resort, with some even nesting in the hotel's garden, to the delight of guests. Annie Van Heerden, 37, manager of the guesthouse and restaurant, said: 'In season, we get them coming in a lot and all the guests love taking pictures of them.' The penguin colony lives 70 metres from the Boulders Beach Lodge and Restaurant, with some even nesting in the garden . 'They're friendly animals, unless you give them a fright, but sometimes it's quite hard to get them out. We have about three nests in the grounds of the lodge. 'The rest of the colony lives about 70 metres away by the beach. They're very popular with people who stay here, although they're pretty noisy at night time.'","African penguin was part of colony that live just 70 metres from hotel .
