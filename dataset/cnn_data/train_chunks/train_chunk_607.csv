Members of the Greek security forces staged a symbolic hanging in front of the nation's parliament in Athens in protest at austerity measures in place in the debt-stricken country. Uniformed members of the police force, fire brigade and coast guard staged the emotive demonstration during a rally yesterday to protest against cuts to security forces' pay and benefits. On the same day the European Central Bank launched a bold plan to save the crumbling euro from collapse, but this led to a damaging rift with Germany. Protest: Uniformed members of the Greek security forces staged a mock hanging outside the country's parliament in Athens . ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank will buy the debt of troubled eurozone countries such as Spain to bring down their borrowing costs and  prevent a break-up of the  single currency. 'Row': ECB president Mario Draghi has said the bank will buy the debt of troubled eurozone countries . Stock markets soared across Europe, with the FTSE 100 up 119.48 points to 5777.34. But the launch of so-called ‘outright monetary transactions’ triggered a row with Germany which is opposed to what it sees as central bank funding of profligate governments. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank and a member of the ECB, has threatened to quit over Mr Draghi’s plan. Mr Draghi said the ECB will focus on buying bonds –  government IOUs – due for repayment within three years. But he insisted there would be strings attached for any government that wants to tap the scheme, with the conditions overseen by Europe and the International Monetary Fund. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, welcomed the ECB plan and said the organisation stood ‘ready to co-operate’. Spanish prime minister  Mariano Rajoy showed no sign of rushing to seek a bailout that would come with tough conditions for his recession-gripped country. ‘When there is news I will tell you,’ he said following a meeting in Madrid with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

A homeowner fed up with a row over a fence his neighbour put up between their houses has renamed his home 'Ugly Fence House'. Roy Bentley, 83, compared the 5ft high fence between the homes in South Wootton, Norfolk,with posts facing into his garden to something from Auschwitz. The retired musician also claims his neighbours, John and Irene Laws, have encroached onto his land, prompting him to put the new name of his £270,000 house on his car port. Roy Bentley renamed his home to Ugly Fence House after his neighbours put up a fence between their properties . The row follows a 30 year friendship between the two households and now police have issued him with a harassment notice. However, he and his wife Rita, 81, are refusing to back down and insisted he would keep fighting until he gets a 'neutral fence'. He said: 'We have seen each others families grow up and have some wonderful memories. 'Then they built the fence in such an unreasonable manner and with very little negotiation and the arguments began. 'We don't even have pleasantries . any more we simply shout over the fence - I have told them it it is . hideous it looks like something out of Auschwitz. 'We don't spend a lot of time in the . garden, I have a little vegetable plot but I am elderly and therefore we . just keep it tidy. 'Next door they have a beautiful garden which is funny really as they chose the most hideous fence. I keep asking them to remove the fence back to their property. It is really ugly. 'I have driven around the parish and . you wouldn't find an uglier fence anywhere. The police have asked me to . take down the signs. I am hoping not too. 'I am not sad that 30 years of friendship has come to this because they started it.' The row follows a 30 year friendship between the two households. Mr Bentley takes exception to the fact that wooden posts are on his side of the fence and claims the Laws next door encroached onto his land . The Laws first contacted police in May last year after claiming the he damaged their fence. They said: 'It is a sad situation as we used to be friends and it is a shame it has come to this.' In November army veteran Mr Bentley, who served in Palestine with the Second Batalion Middlesex Regiment in 1957, renamed his house 'Ugly Fence House' then added the second 'ugly' sign in February. Last week he was issued with a warning notice by police, which outlines that his behaviour could be deemed as a harassment offence. Mr and Mrs Laws said they installed the fence as part of a garden revamp after bamboo from Mr Bentley's garden lifted their concrete slabs by three inches. Dave Marshall, a Superintendent at Kings Lynn police station, said: 'Neighbours in respect of the fence dispute have been spoken to by officers and one resident has been issued with a notice outlining the alleged behaviour is unacceptable and may constitute an offence under the harassment act. 'If there is a further course of conduct of this nature he may be liable for arrest and or prosecution.'","Police have warned Roy Bentley he faces being arrested for harassment .

Cheesy clips of pretty girls bouncing around eating yoghurt and chatting over a lunch of lettuce leaves are the norm as food companies try to convince us that we are all too fat and should rush immediately to the supermarket to stock up on lo-cal foods. Now one Irish food brand has embraced the superficial stereotypes of these TV commercials and created a parody of the perfect women of ad land for, er, a clever new TV commercial. Muffin Gal, Smug Gal and Ditzy Gal are the three stars of a new parody of diet product commercials . Smug Gal, Ditzy Gal and Muffin Gal are the stars of the film, . Smug Gal nibbles crackers all day and bounces around on a red and white bed in her skinny jeans, Ditzy Gal loves to dance around with a yoghurt pot and Muffin Gal is obsessed with her weight and even more obsessed with cake. All three of them seem to be nauseatingly happy as they deny themselves calories and sweet treats to concentrate on their waist lines. The one minute clip opens with another deliriously happy woman singing: 'Here are the girls from ad land, selling diet dreams from *insert brand*.

Jack - or Julie as he is known when dressed in feminine attire - loves nothing more than to go out, meet a man or woman and indulge in wild sex. The 75-year-old is representative of an increasingly . virile older generation who, despite their advancing . years, enjoys a regular and rather unconventional sex life. 'Sex is a . major part of my life,’ he says. ‘I enjoy it, it’s fun and so does my . regular girlfriend. We both like having sex with other people, with . ourselves as much a possible. I have sex with guys at clubs, usually in fairly dark . surroundings. 'I'’ll do anything that’s not judged as high risk although low risk doesn’t mean no risk.’ Scroll down for video . Thrillseeker: Jack, 75, enjoys a fulfilling sex life with his girlfriend as well as with unknown men and women . Jack is just one of the many colourful characters that viewers meet when watching The Sex Clinic, Channel 4's new mini-series documenting the varied clientele such a service attracts. The number of people visiting sex clinics in the UK for medical help or advice has doubled in the past five years. Indeed Britain is in the midst of an . epidemic, with over nine million Britons suffering with some form of . sexually transmitted disease (STD), and the rates of infection are . rising every day. And nowhere is more aware - or . stretched by - this than the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and . University Hospitals Birmingham, who manage the UK's two largest sexual . health clinics. In episode two we meet adults of all ages and backgrounds who are concerned about their likelihood of suffering with an STD. There is responsible 28-year-old Camille, who simply wants to make sure she is safe to 'take her relationship to the next level'. Jack - or Julie when dressed as his female alter ego - is concerned he might have caught and STD after a brief encounter . And course there is Jack who has visited the Dean Street Clinic in Soho, part of the Chelsea and . Westminster Trust, because he has been suffering with bleeding in a . delicate area. Having gone into remission from prostate cancer, a common disease amongst his age group, Jack is unsure as to whether he has caught an STD or his cancer has returned. He slept with a person the previous week but had no idea who he or she was. Asked if he has suffered with an STD before, he responds that he has, having previously suffered with chlamydia, warts and herpes. Jack claims that when he is not dressed as Julie he is not attracted to men. Although his dedication to his alter-ego has also led him to have hormone therapy to grow a small pair of breasts. He also admits that his choice of skirt has shortened as he's grown older. The doctor recommends he gets tested for various STDs and he must wait a week before he gets his results. Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed STD in Britain, closely followed by gonorrhoea, the HPV virus and syphilis. A 2010 report from the Health . Protection Agency found a rise in the number of people in their 50s, . 60s, 70s and 80s having sex with new partners since 2000. The study also found that there had . been an increase in all of the five main STDs in older age groups, with . the age group 45 to 64 witnessing the biggest rise in syphilis, herpes, . chlamydia and genital warts between 2000 and 2009. Further north at the Wittal Clinic in Birmingham is David, 19,  one of many teenagers who seem entirely ignorant about sexual health. During his consultation he seems less concerned by his regular sex without a condom than the fact he slept with a woman who didn't wash before having sex with him. The . nurse has to explain to him that washing plays no role in preventing . being infected with an STD. It is also recommended he had the vaccine for Hepatitis B because he cannot keep track of the amount of people he sleeps with and he rarely uses a condom. When asked when he does use one, he responds: 'It depends on whether I'm drunk or can be arsed.' Harry is concerned he has caught the HIV virus after engaging in a drug-fuelled 24-hour sex binge . Feeling faint: The reality of Harry's situation hits him during a visit to the Sex Clinic . Back in London, 22-year-old Harry is concerned he may have contracted HIV after enjoying a 24-hour drug-fuelled sex session. He is given an PEP test which can instantly tell a doctor whether a patient was HIV positive up to six weeks previously. Harry tests negative so is given an intensive course of antiviral drugs, although he will have to wait another month before he know for sure if he contracted it over the weekend. It is thought that one in seven gay men living in London suffer with HIV. However, Harry suffers hideous side-effects from the drugs and stops taking them after just one week. For him, the discomfort was too much to bear and he is faced with an agonising wait for his final results.

"By . David Cameron . PUBLISHED: . 17:23 EST, 5 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:08 EST, 5 October 2012 . Those who say we are abandoning the centre ground of politics could not be further from the truth. The Conservative party is right where we need to be – not just waffling about the issues that matter to people but actually delivering on them. And I know that few things matter more to people than the NHS and safeguarding it against the storms. When I think of my family and our happiest and saddest memories, I think of the NHS. From the incredible care and attention we received in Cornwall when our daughter Florence was born almost a month early, to some of the saddest times, staying on the wards where my son Ivan was being treated. A father's love: Prime Minister David Cameron with his son Ivan, who suffered from a rare combination of cerebral palsy and epilepsy and died in 2009, aged 6 . But while they were sad times, I always had what I call the NHS feeling: knowing when you walk over the threshold not just that your child is in safe hands but also that they’ve got access to some of the best care and best specialists anywhere in the world. There is absolutely nothing I would do to jeopardise that. That’s why I made a big decision before the election to protect the NHS budget. Labour called it ‘irresponsible’. The Liberal Democrats did not protect it either. It was only Conservatives who made that choice. Yes, these are difficult times – but we point-blank refused to cut the budget of the NHS. Because of the choice we made, this year the NHS budget is bigger than at any point in history – and the results are plain to see. The number of doctors and midwives is up. Mixed-sex wards have been all but eradicated. Hospital infections are down to their lowest rate on record. The number of people waiting more than six months before they start treatment has been cut in half. But there is more to do. Because the success of the NHS can’t be measured in budget figures and percentage points. It’s about care; dignity; kindness. The nurses who rub patients’ backs, the GP who knows your name, the knowledge that if your mum or dad is on a ward they’ll have someone there to pour them water, keep them fed, make them comfortable and talk to them. No 'if's, not 'but's, no cuts: The Prime Minister proudly defends the Conservative Party's decision not to make any cuts to the NHS budget . All the doctors, nurses and midwives who have looked after my family have been brilliant. But we know there are too many instances where,  put simply, the care hasn’t been there. From the elderly lady who gets treated like a nuisance  because she wants an extra pillow, to those terrible scandals in Mid-Staffordshire. And when people have been upset by all this, too often they’ve just been met with a barrage of bureaucracy – the boxes have been ticked and the quotas have been met. The bureaucracy got bigger than the people – and my mission with the NHS is to change that. We need to focus relentlessly on improving the care people get, and we’re taking some big, practical steps to achieve that. First, we’re introducing one of the most simple tests that any caring organisation can have. We’re asking staff and patients if they would be happy to recommend the hospital they’re in to their friends and family. It’s called the Friends and Family test, and the results show in a very human way how a hospital is performing: not just how their budget’s looking; but how people feel about being there. Brilliant staff: David and Samantha Cameron re-visit the Princess Alexandra Maternity Unit at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro where their daughter Florence was born in August 2010 . Achievement: Prime Minister David Cameron during a visit to Birmingham Children's Hospital earlier this year, ahead of the introduction of the 'Friends and Family test' where patients rate their treatment . I’ll never forget going to a hospital in Salford and the staff were so proud at their great results that they stuck them up on the walls of the wards. They were proud, but they also knew they were going to have to keep it up – and this is how we can change the culture of the NHS. Second, we’re making sure that more people get the drugs and treatments they need. Years ago, before I was Prime Minister, I was stopped on the street by a man called Clive Stone. He had cancer, he couldn’t get the life-saving drugs he needed and he said: ‘If you ever get into Number 10, please do something about it.’ And we have. One of the first things I did was set up the Cancer Drugs Fund to get drugs to people who need it – and it’s helped more than 21,000 people so far. Praise: The Prime Minister, pictured with nurses at the Whipps Cross University Hospital maternity wing in London, says he is grateful to the staff who has taken care of his family and pledges to improve the NHS . Now we’re taking even more urgent action to help those suffering with cancer. It’s not just drugs people need, it’s other lifesaving treatment – like innovative radiotherapy that can more accurately focus radiation on the tumour. We are making £15million available straightaway to make sure our NHS staff are trained to give treatments like this. And we’re doing something else. We already have a guarantee for drugs – that if they’re safe, cost-effective and doctors say you need them, you will get them. From April 2013, for the first time ever, we’re extending that guarantee to radiotherapy too. This is going to help thousands of people at one of the hardest times of their lives. Alongside all this, we’re bringing in a new Nursing Excellence Fund, for those who are right on the front-line of caring for people. It’s going to give £100million to get new time-saving technology on the wards, so nurses spend less time box-ticking and fiddling about with medical records and more time on caring for their patients. It’s just one of the practical steps we’re taking to make the NHS stronger and better for everyone who uses it. So this is what you get from the Conservative Party this week. Action, not slogans. Government, not politics. Detail, not waffle. We are taking the tough, long-term decisions Britain needs today so that we can thrive in the years ahead. And we’re focusing relentlessly on what matters to the back-bone of Britain – the people who work hard and do the right thing.","The Prime Minister writes about his promise to improve Britain's health services and protecting the NHS budget .

Colombia may decriminalise the use of synthetic drugs, including ecstasy, as part of its plans to tackle social problems caused by its widespread drug problems. The proposal by Justice Minister Ruth Stella Correa could replace laws which ban cocaine and marijuana, although people are not prosecuted for possessing small amounts. Politicians are considering the legislation as a way to curb both drug use and trafficking in the country. Illegal high: Ecstasy and other synthetic drugs may be decriminalised in Colombia after changes to the law were proposed . The nation has long been a major exporter of drugs, although cocaine production has dropped significantly in recent years, and has suffered countless murders and widespread political instability as a result of the powerful cartels who control the incredibly lucrative cocaine trade. However, it also suffers from rampant drug abuse within its borders. Colombia's Ministry of Health reports that the consumption of drugs in Colombia's largest cities is increasing, with heroin addiction a particular concern. Last year former Justice Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra said: 'It is indisputable that there are concerns in Colombia over the advancement of drug addiction in schools and universities. A narcotics policeman alongside cocaine seized in the port of Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca department, Colombia. The country has a history of drug exporting but internal drug use is now becoming a major problem . Esguerra added that Colombia had gone from being a 'producer country to a consumer' in recent years. Ms Stella Correa's comments followed a meeting with a commission set up to scrutinise the government's drug policies over the last 10 years. The noted liberal highlighted that the nation's Constitutional Court had already criticised charging people carrying small amounts of marijuana and cocaine. A Colombian child sniffs glue on the streets of Medellin, the former power base of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. Heroin use in particular is a growing cause of concern in urban areas. 'The new statute to be presented to the Congress during this mandate intends to make this authorisation concrete, but broadening it to include synthetic drugs into what is defined as the personal dose', she told Colombia's National Radio. It is a stark contrast to Colombia's recent hardline approach to the drug problem, with laws that penalised possession and consumption. A spokesman for the country's Green Party supported the plans. They said: 'The problem in Colombia is a problem with soft drugs: marijuana and cocaine. 'The curse of drug trafficking depends fundamentally on cocaine and the decriminalisation in the world will end this business,' senator Roy Barreras told Caracol Radio station. However, critics say that decriminalising the personal use of synthetic drugs will only make the debate more complicated. And some argue the 'synthetic' definition could be applied to heroin, a growing problem in urban areas such as Cucuta, Medellin, Bogota, and regions such as the Coffee Region and the municipality of Santander de Quilichao in the Cauca department. Last week, Colombia's president Juan Manuel Santos said the nation needed to reassess the 'war on drugs'.","Justice minister wants possession of small amounts decriminalised .

The NHS is under ‘severe strain’ triggered by the crisis in out-of-hours care and casualty departments, according to the influential King’s Fund. More than 300,000 patients waited for four hours or longer during the first three months of this year – nearly 6 per cent of all patients. Waiting times for A&E patients are at their highest point for nearly a decade, a report has warned . That figure is the highest since 2004 and breaches the Government’s target which states that no more than 5 per cent of patients should be kept waiting more than four hours. The latest disastrous milestone is further evidence that many A&E departments are struggling to cope with a surge in patient numbers. Chaos in out-of-hours care and the botched launch of the Government’s 111 non-emergency number have been accused of pushing many hospitals to breaking point, with senior A&E doctors warning they can no longer guarantee safe care for patients. John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, said emergency care acts as a barometer for the NHS . Other figures show how the crisis in emergency care is having a knock-on effect through the NHS. The number of cancelled operations has reached a nine-year high, with almost 20,000 planned operations scrapped at the last minute in the first three months of the year – none of them for clinical reasons. Urgent operations have also been hit – with twice as many cancellations in April 2013 as the same month last year – as over-stretched A&E units admit rising numbers of patients to hospital. But they are filling beds that would otherwise have been used for surgical patients, forcing surgeons to cancel operations. The monitoring report from The King’s Fund, a health policy think-tank, showed between January and March 5.9 per cent of patients (313,000 people) waited for four hours or longer in A&E. It is an increase of more than a third on the previous three months, and of nearly 40 per cent since the same quarter the previous year. It is barely two years since the Prime Minister pledged to keep A&E waiting times low in June 2011. John Appleby, chief economist at the King’s Fund, said: ‘Emergency care acts as a barometer for the NHS. The worryingly high number of patients waiting longer than four hours in the last quarter of 2012-13 is a clear warning sign that the health system is under severe strain. ‘The pressures in emergency care will not be relieved by focusing on a single aspect of the problem  in isolation – it requires a co- ordinated response across the whole health system.’ The King’s Fund also found a rise of 7 per cent in patients waiting more than four hours before being admitted to hospital from A&E, the highest level since 2004. There has also been a rise in ambulances queuing to get patients into A&E. Although waiting times appear to have declined slightly since April, the King’s Fund is warning that similar pressures next winter could spark a renewed crisis. The Government has set up an urgent care review under Sir Bruce Keogh and is ‘freeing up’ money to improve A&E services. A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The most recent statistics show that for the fifth week in a row we are meeting the A&E four-hour target.’","NHS under ‘severe strain’ because of out-of-hours care and casualty crisis .

Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad has launched an astonishing attack on Britain, accusing the 'arsonist' government of being 'naive, confused and unrealistic' in its approach to the ongoing conflict in his country. He went on to warn of 'grave' consequences if the West armed its rebels. Assad said that Britain has been unconstructive in its attempts to militarise the rebels . In an interview with the Sunday Times he said Britain was sacrificing peace talks to push for an end to an EU arms embargo, which would allow rebels to be armed. Warning this would accelerate the road to . war, he rejected the possibility of help from Britain to end the . conflict, saying: 'We do not expect an arsonist to be a firefighter.' Scroll down for video . Syrian President Bashar Assad speaks during an interview with the Sunday Times. He attacked the 'arsonist' British government and issued a dire warning against arming rebels . He added: 'How can we expect to ask Britain to play a role when it is determined to militarise the problem? 'How can you ask them to play a role in making the situation better, more stable? 'How can we expect them to make the violence less while they want to send military supply to the terrorists and don't try to ease the dialogue between the Syrian(s). 'To be frank, Britain has played famously . in our region (an) unconstructive role in different issues, for . decades, some say for centuries. 'This Government is acting in a naïve, . confused, and unrealistic manner. If they want to play a role they have . to change this, they have to act in a more reasonable and responsible . way.' Assad warned that if the West made moves that ended up with rebels being armed, there would grave consequences. 'Syria lies at the fault line . geographically, politically, socially and ideologically. So playing with . this fault line will have serious repercussions all over the Middle . East . 'Any intervention will not make these things better. It will only make them worse. Europe and the United States and others are going to pay the price . sooner or later with the instability in this region. They do not foresee . it.' Foreign secretary William Hague branded Assad 'delusional' on The Andrew Marr Show after the Syrian president spoke out against Britain's actions to push for an end to an EU arms embargo . Today, foreign secretary William Hague dismissed Assad's criticism of Britain as 'delusional' and said Britain could not afford just to 'sit on the sidelines' and watch the slaughter continue in Syria. Speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, Hague refused to rule out the prospect that Britain could arm the Syrian rebels, despite Assad's warning. 'The longer this goes on the greater the danger that extremism takes . hold, the greater the danger of destabilising neighbouring countries, . and the greater the extreme humanitarian distress involved. So we cannot . just sit on the sidelines and watch this. 'We will be doing more and we will have to steadily do more if there is . no diplomatic or political breakthrough. 'The situation in Syria now is . too dangerous to the peace and security of that entire region and . thereby to the world to ignore it.' Hague, who is set to announce further non-lethal assistance to the rebels later this week, said that the UK would continue to . step up support for the opposition as long as there was no diplomatic or . political breakthrough in the two-year long conflict. 'I don't rule anything out for the future,' he said. 'If this is going to go on for . months or years and more tens of thousands of people are going to die . and countries like Iraq and Lebanon and Jordan are going to be . destabilised it is not something we can ignore. 'These are the reasons why we can't just sit it out in Syria.'

Members of the Martyr Abdallah Al Kaakeh battalion head to the front line in their conflict with forces loyal to the Syrian president, in Aleppo's Salaheddine district . The conflict in Syria has killed an estimated 70,000 people since it started two years ago, while thousands of refugees have fled the country. Assad has also offered the opposition the chance of peace talks, if they are willing to put down their weapons. The Syrian president said: 'We are ready to negotiate with anyone, including militants who surrender their arms.' The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces denied any offers of peace talks from Assad's government. The UK has said that they will not provide rebels with arms despite supporting the opposition. But, Foreign Secretary William Hague has not ruled out possible intervention in the future and is expected to detail an aid programme in parliament next week. A Foreign Office spokesman said earlier this week: 'We want to do more and we want to give more types of support and we’re pushing to do that.' This comes as newly appointed US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on his first overseas tour in the role. He said: 'The opposition needs more help.

Diet guru Jenny Craig is being sued by a comedienne after the woman claimed that weight loss products caused her to have a miscarriage and left her needing 1,000 gallstones removed. Mara Shapshay, who has worked on sitcoms including Friends and South Park, launched a lawsuit this week for unspecified damages, claiming that she was left with serious health problems after using the diet products in 2011. Ms Shapshay, who is also a magazine columnist, alleges that the Jenny Craig company is aware that their products can cause gall bladder disease but do not come with health warnings. Lawsuit: Actress and comedienne Mara Shapshay claims that the Jenny Craig diet left her with 1,000 gallstones and caused a miscarriage . Following the plan: Ms Shapshay claims that she developed health problems after following the Jenny Craig diet plan, which has 80 meal options . Ms Shapshay said that she had to undergo several surgeries following the Jenny Craig diet and has been left with  fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, according to TMZ. She also says the diet is responsible for a miscarriage she suffered. In 1994, Jenny Craig Inc. settled a class action lawsuit from 360,000 clients in Orange County, California after it was alleged that products could cause gall bladder disease. It agreed to a $10million payout and gave away $36million in merchandise but admitted no wrongdoing, according to the LA Times. The Jenny Craig weight loss program . was started in 1983 in Australia by Jenny Craig, now 80, and her husband . Sidney Harvey Craig. The . diet was launched in the U.S. two years later and now has 700 centers . across the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and Guam. Promises: The Jenny Craig weight loss plan provides meals and support from diet consultants along with exercise recommendations . Lucrative brand: Figurehead of the weight-loss brand Jenny Craig, now 80, along with her late husband Sidney Harvey Craig, started the successful business in 1983 . The program, which is followed by around 150,000 dieters at any point, offers 80 meal choices and snacks along with advise on portion sizes and exercise. Jenny Craig Inc was bought by Nestlé in 2006 for $600million. In a statement to MailOnline on Monday, a Jenny Craig spokesperson said: 'Out . of respect for the legal process, we usually do not comment on possible . litigation.  However, given this extreme claim we feel it is important to . publicly respond. 'While Jenny Craig is sympathetic to any person . suffering from medical conditions, it is irresponsible to claim that the . Jenny Craig program was the cause of these issues. 'Jenny Craig’s program, . whose clinical trial was published in JAMA in . 2011, is designed by registered dieticians in close consultation with a medical . advisory board and reflects the guidelines of major health organizations. 'Clients following the Jenny Craig program, on average, lose 1-2 pounds per . week. This is a safe rate of weight loss that results from a . nutritionally-balanced menu that is moderately low in fat.  This lawsuit . is a clear attempt to incite the public and seek a quick settlement.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:32 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:44 EST, 3 June 2013 . A woman has claimed that a group of prostitutes smashed her head against a brick wall in the bar of a lavish Florida hotel when they mistook her for competition. Anna Burgese and her husband Joseph, from Medford, New Jersey, were visiting the W South Beach hotel in Miami Beach in January when the alleged incident occurred. They said that rather than offering them assistance, staff at the hotel helped the prostitutes escape in taxis before police arrived, and have since been uncooperative with the police investigation. The couple has now filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Camden against Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which operates the swanky hotel. Scene: Anna and Joseph Burgese claim she was attacked while staying at the W South Beach hotel . The couple was returning from a night at the hotel's club in the early hours of January 19 and started walking through the hotel's bar to reach the lobby and their rooms, the lawsuit claimed. Their attorney, Lance Rogers, told the Philadelphia Daily News that the bar is used by prostitutes to pick up men. The hotel is well known for these women who tout for business, the lawsuit added. As they walked through the bar, Mrs Burgese was suddenly grabbed from behind, thrown face-first into a stone wall and then thrown to the ground, the lawsuit said. As many as 10 women were involved, with some starting the attack, others witnessing it and more helping them escape the scene, Rogers said. 'Unprovoked': They were walking through the bar, pictured, when a woman allegedly grabbed Mrs Burgese's head and shoved it against a wall. Police said the women could have seen her as competition . Mrs Burgese was treated for trauma to her face and knee at a nearby hospital. Joseph Burgese said he learned that hotel staff he had asked to detain the prostitutes let them go and put them in a taxi before police arrived. The lawsuit claims that a hotel staff member told him 'that they knew who the attackers were' but then later 'claimed ignorance as to the identity of the attackers'. Since then, the hotel has also refused to cooperate, Rogers said. He said the hotel would not hand over surveillance footage of the attack. Police have so far made no arrests. 'The hotel has done absolutely nothing to help them and, in fact, has stood in the way of the process,' he said. Helping hand: After the early-morning attack, staff allegedly put the women in cabs and did not ask for ID . Miami Beach police told the couple that the women were prostitutes and may have thought Mrs Burgese was 'another prostitute who was capturing business at the hotel', the lawsuit said. It added that the hotel 'fosters a prostitute-friendly environment where prostitutes are permitted to market themselves on premises, as evidenced by, among other things, the reviews left on various travel websites by former guests.' And 'as a result of the attacks, plaintiff Anna Burgese was seriously injured and suffered physical and mental anguish', it said. Starwood Hotels & Resorts said: 'We truly regret that this incident occurred and that one of our guests was injured. Because of the pending litigation, we are unable to comment further at this time.'","Anna Burgese was walking through hotel bar with her husband when women 'grabbed her and smacked her head against a brick wall'

The Army psychiatrist charged in the deadly 2009 Fort Hood shooting rampage says he'll use a 'defense of others' argument when he represents himself at his upcoming murder trial. Maj. Nidal Hasan didn't elaborate when he announced his strategy today, shortly after a military judge agreed to allow him to represent himself. But it was the first time Hasan hinted at his reasoning behind the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than two dozen others on the Texas Army post. Representing himself: Maj. Nidal Hasan will defend himself at his trial for the 2009 Fort Hood shooing rampage . Hasan also asked for a three-month delay to prepare his new defense. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, said she would rule at a hearing Tuesday. It's unclear if jury selection will still be held Wednesday as scheduled. Hasan faces the death penalty or life without parole if convicted. It was revealed last month, that Hasan has been paid $278,000 since the shooting on November 5, 2009. Soldiers injured in the horrific attack at the Texas army base are fighting to receive the same pay and medical benefits as those injured in combat, but the Department of Defense confirmed that Major Nidal Hasan has continued to be paid. The Army said that under the Military Code of Justice, unless Hasan is found guilty, his salary cannot be suspended. Army Specialist Logan Burnett, who was shot three times at the Army Deployment Center, is appalled that the accused gunman is still being paid. Appalled: Logan Burnett, who was shot at Fort Hood, and his wife Torey now struggle to pay for groceries . 'There have been times when my wife and I . cannot afford groceries. We cannot afford gas in our car,' Mr Burnett, who has since retired, said. 'This makes me sick.' If the army psychiatrist had been a civilian employee at the base, the Army could have suspended his pay after only one week, NBC5 Investigates said. Personnel rules for most civilian . government workers allow for 'indefinite suspensions' in cases 'when the . agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a . crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed'. The continued salary is just one of several battles victims of the shooting are fighting. Because the Army classified the shooting as workplace violence rather than being combat related, and refuses to call it a terrorist attack, the gunman's victims have been denied benefits they would ordinarily be entitled to. Help: Army medical staff treat their fellow servicemen who were shot in the attack at the Texas base . Under the combat related classification, servicemen would be entitled to the pay, Purple Heart retirement and medical benefits afforded to soldiers wounded in war, or during the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. This means that Mr Burnett, who had been due to go to Iraq before the shooting, and the other victims and their families, are missing out of thousands of dollars in benefits and pay each year. On the third anniversary of the shooting, victims filed a lawsuit against the Army to try to win back the rights to the benefits they claim they are entitled to. Mr Burnett was appalled when he was shown a letter from the Department of Defense confirming Hasan had been paid more than $278,000. The letter was a response to a request by NBC5 Investigates under the Freedom of Information Act.","Major Nidal Hasan will use a 'defense of others' argument in his murder trial .

Last time he visited the U.S, Prince Harry made a big impression for all the wrong reasons. But the 28-year-old prince is preparing to tour there again in May. And this time, there will be no lost nights in Las Vegas. Harry will visit Washington, Denver, Colorado Springs, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in a week-long trip which he hopes will highlight the work of his charities, particularly those supporting injured servicemen and women. Close to heart: Prince Harry's trip will focus on his many charities, particularly those involving the rehabilitation of soldiers injured in service . He will also be on official business on behalf of the Government, helping to promote British trade, commerce and tourism abroad. Harry is still living down his last trip to the US, back in August, when he enjoyed a ‘lads’ holiday’ in Las Vegas and was photographed naked playing a game of ‘strip billiards’ with a party of women in his £5,000-a-night hotel suite. He has refused to apologise publicly for his antics, which caused huge embarrassment to the Royal Family, but has admitted that he let them down. But last year he also completed his first, hugely successful, official solo royal tour to the Caribbean and Brazil, where he won admiration for his warmth and enthusiasm, dancing in the streets with locals and doing his best to race Usain Bolt, the fastest man on Earth. According to sources, Harry, who recently returned from four months in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter pilot, will undertake this latest trip in his own ‘indomitable style’. It is sure to be a draw for royal fans as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are expecting their first child in July, will not travel abroad this year, palace sources have confirmed. Prince's cause: The 28-year-old Royal will also play in a polo tournament on behalf of Sentebale, the organisation he personally set up to help Aids orphans in Lesotho which he visited last month . Harry’s trip begins in Washington DC . on May 9 with a visit to an exhibition on Capitol Hill to publicise the . work of landmine clearance charity HALO trust. He will also make a pilgrimage to the Arlington National Cemetery and aides have not ruled out a meeting with President Obama. The main focus of the trip, however, . will be the 2013 Warrior Games in Colorado Springs which will see more . than 200 wounded servicemen, including a 35-strong British team, compete . in seven sports. Harry will then fly on to New Jersey . to visit an area affected by last year’s Hurricane Sandy and carry out . several engagements in New York. The highlight of this part of the trip . is an event to publicise the GREAT Campaign, led by the Department for . Culture, Media and Sport, to promote Britain.

A helicopter carrying Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was forced to make an emergency landing in a mountainous region north of Tehran on Sunday. The president’s website later said that no one was hurt. Ahmadinejad had been on his way to a ceremony to inaugurate a road tunnel, the website said. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was on his way to inaugurate a road tunnel when his helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing . ‘The helicopter carrying Dr. Ahmadinejad and some executive officials accompanying him had an accident in the Alborz mountains this morning ... the pilot managed to land the helicopter with complete skill. ‘The president and his entourage are right now in perfect health.’ It is not known what caused the emergency landing. Iran's official news agency says Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's helicopter experienced an unspecified ‘incident’ while touring a rural area, but the Iranian president's pilot landed the aircraft safely and the leader was unhurt. The report by IRNA did not elaborate on the Sunday incident, which happened as Ahmadinejad was en route to a mountainous area in the north of the country to inaugurate a highway tunnel. It said the pilot landed skillfully and neither the president nor his companions were hurt. The report said Ahmadinejad made it to the inauguration ceremony on time. The pilot skillfully landed the helicopter in north Iran's Alborz Mountains . Ahmadinejad is reaching the end of his second and final term as president of Iran . Mr Ahmadinejad is coming to the end of his second term as Iranian president. There are fresh elections later this year, but Mr Ahmadinejad cannot stand again as Iranain rulers are barred from standing for presidential office three times. Iranian police also arrested several people campaigning for a reformist candidate in this month's presidential election. They picked up several supporters of candidate Hasan Rowhani after he delivered a speech according to his campaign manager, Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh. ‘Some people were detained on the street after leaving the meeting,’ he  told the semi-official Mehr news agency. The June 14 election is to choose a replacement for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Authorities have already pared down the list of candidates to eight, disqualifying Ahmadinejad's top aide and a former president who could have galvanized opposition to the harsh clerical system. It has been suggested that this is because Iran's rulers do not want to risk the widespread riots that broke out when Ahmadinejad was re-elected in 2009.

'It is natural that police have carried out their tasks.’ An exile-based Iranian opposition website reported that authorities arrested at least seven people who attended Rowhani's campaign appearance. It said the arrests were made after participants chanted slogans calling for the release of Mir Hossein Mousavi, an opposition leader and candidate in the disputed 2009 election, who has been under house arrest for more than two years.

During an appearance on Monday in a Union County jail courtroom, McGillivary questioned Judge Brenda Coppola Cuba at times about his plea and bail. He wore an oatmeal-colored T-shirt and stood in a part of the courtroom enclosed by thick glass. Scroll down for video . Infamous Kai: Caleb McGillivary was arraigned on murder charges in a Union County jail courtroom in Elizabeth, New Jersey today after he allegedly bludgeoned a 73-year-old lawyer in his home . Lockdown: Caleb McGillivary, a Canadian citizen who is known as Kai, appeared in court behind safety glass as he asked numerous questions about the U.S. legal system . McGillivary said a private attorney is attempting to contact him but claims he was not allowed to use a phone in jail. The judge told McGillivary he would be allowed to make a phone call. Lorraine Stanley, the public defender representing McGillivary, said friends have been working to get defense attorney Miles Feinstein involved in McGillivary's case. A woman who answered the phone at Mr Feinstein's office said he was in court. McGillivary took a star turn in February after intervening in an attack on a Fresno, California utility worker. He described himself as 'home free' instead of homeless and said he's from West Virginia. He is actually Canadian. Grisly death: Lawyer Joseph Galfy was found bludgeoned to the death in his home on May 13 . Casual: McGillivary said 'cool' when he was told in the New Jersey court on Monday that his bail would be set to $3million . McGillivary at times appeared confused about the charges against him and the way the American legal process works. He asked the judge to 'elaborate' on the charges, and asked if he would be able to 'postpone the plea' if he was represented by a private lawyer. Stanley told McGillivary she was pleading not guilty on his behalf to 'get the ball rolling'. The case will now go before a grand jury. McGilivary was told at the end of the proceeding he is being held on $3 million bail. 'Ok, fine. Cool,' he said. Authorities say McGillivary and Galfy met in New York City.

The 73-year-old was found severely beaten and wearing only his underwear and socks by police, who went to his home to check on his well-being. Statements posted on McGillvary's Facebook page following the homicide indicated the encounter was sexual in nature. On his Facebook page, McGillvary's last post before he was arrested said: 'What would you do? if you awoke in a stranger's house and found you'd been drugged and sexually assaulted.' One friend who commented suggests 'hitting him with a hatchet' – and McGillvary's final comment on the post said: 'I like your idea.'

President Barack Obama on Monday called for a more robust national discussion on mental illness, saying the time had come to bring the issue 'out of the shadows.' Speaking at the opening session of a White House conference on mental health, the president said his goal was to let people affected by these issues know they should not suffer in silence. 'Struggling with a mental illness or caring for someone who does can be isolating,' Obama said. 'It begins to feel as if, not only are you alone, but that you shouldn't burden others with the challenge.' Top administration officials, along with . actors Bradley Cooper and Glenn Close, were among those participating . in the White House conference. Improving mental health: Education Secretary Arne Duncan listens as President Barack Obama speaks in the East Room of the White House during the White House mental health conference . Celebrity supporters: Actor Bradley Cooper, center, listens during a panel discussion on mental health issues . The conference is part of Obama's response to last year's shooting massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. While the president emphasized that most people with mental health problems are not violent, he said untreated mental illness can lead to larger tragedies. Vice President Joe Biden later made a gaffe when highlighting the importance of nurses. 'If there's any angels in heaven, by the way, they are all nurses,' Biden said, eliciting laughter from the audience. 'Doctors allow you to live. Nurses make you want to live,' he continued to even more cackles, before he quickly corrected himself. 'Male nurses and female nurses,' he said. There's been little publicly revealed about the mental health of Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza, although it's been documented that other gunmen involved in mass shootings suffered from mental illness. Federal law bans certain mentally ill people from purchasing firearms, but the background check system is woefully incomplete and Obama is trying to get more mental health records included. 'We can do something about stories like this,' he said. 'In many cases, treatment is available and effective.' Vice President Joe Biden walks on stage after being introduced by actor Bradley Cooper . Surprise! Vice President Joe Biden stands with former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy. Kennedy was a participant of the conference and was unexpectedly brought up on stage by Biden .

The agenda includes discussion of . insurance coverage for mental health care and substance abuse, . recognizing the signs of mental illness in young people and improved . access to services for veterans. The overall goal is reducing the stigma . of mental health problems and encouraging those who are struggling to . get help. Vice President Joe . Biden, the president's point man on gun violence, is scheduled to close . it from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Around 150 invited . attendees include mental health advocates and patients, educators, . health care providers, faith leaders, lawmakers and local government . officials from across the country. Cooper and Close bring their advocacy and a celebrity buzz to the event. Cooper has been promoting mental . health awareness since his Oscar-nominated leading role as a man with . bipolar disorder in last year's 'Silver Linings Playbook,' and plans to . help Biden and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki close the . conference. Close said . Monday that her experience is 'a family affair.' Her sister, Jessie, was . diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 51 and Jessie's son, Calen, was . diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 19.

She said her nephew feels his brain is healing and that he's 'living a full and wonderful life.' Close said her sister is doing well, 'but what it would have meant to her if she had early diagnosis.' 'We need people living with mental illness with the courage to say this is what I am living with. I can talk about this,' Close said. The conference comes after Obama's defeat on gun control legislation. Unable to get Congress to approve background checks, an assault weapons ban and other limits on firearms, the president has vowed to do what he can through executive action. Among 23 executive orders Obama signed in response to the shooting at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 26 was a directive that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Education Secretary Arne Duncan launch a national dialogue on mental health. The conference is part of that, with Sebelius hosting the panel on addressing negative attitudes and Duncan moderating a session on successful mental health outreach efforts. Mental health help for veterans: Obama announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will conduct mental health summits nationwide to increase awareness of VA programs and link veterans and their families with community resources to support their needs . In announcing the conference, the White House stressed that the vast majority of people with mental health conditions are not violent and are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crimes. But the need to improve the country's mental health care system is something all sides of the gun debate have advocated, including the National Rifle Association. 'That is something substantive that Congress and the president could do right now that would actually help prevent future tragedies, unlike the gun control proposals that the president unsuccessfully tried to push through Congress,' said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam . Obama announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will conduct mental health summits nationwide to increase awareness of VA programs and link veterans and their families with community resources to support their needs. The conference also plans to tout improvements in mental health coverage under Obama's health care law, including a ban beginning next year against denying coverage to those who are mentally ill. The White House also plans to focus on commitments being made in the private sector to increase understanding and awareness, including a campaign by the National Association of Broadcasters through television and radio ads and social media. Several organizations that work with young people also are planning to make new commitments, including high school principals holding mental health assemblies, to YMCA instructing staff and camp counselors to recognize the signs of mental health issues in kids, to religious leaders launching conversations on the issue.","Obama made the remarks at a mental health conference at the White House .

Scene: Paula Castle, 85, fell to the ground hitting her head during the attack in this alleyway in West London . Police condemned the ‘cowardly attack’ and said her handbag was found discarded in a garden nearby. Neighbours said Mrs Castle was a . ‘strong little lady’ who lived an independent life despite suffering a . double tragedy over the past decade.

Graham Driscoll, 49, who grew up on . the street where she lived, said the victim was unlikely to be carrying . much cash or any valuables. He said: ‘The scumbags that did this . probably don’t even know she’s dead, and if they do, they probably don’t . care. If they got £10 from her purse I suppose they would have thought . that it was worth it.’ Tributes: Flowers have been left at the scene where Mrs Castle was knocked over by two thugs who snatched her handbag . Specialist police officers scour the area close to the scene of the attack. A murder investigation has now been launched . The robbery took place a short distance from a primary school, in Greenford, West London, on Monday afternoon. It is the latest shocking attack to . highlight rising levels of street crime which have soared by as much as . 40 per cent in some parts of the capital. Witnesses saw two black teenage boys . wearing dark clothing and hoods loitering around the alleyway in the . minutes before Mrs Castle was robbed. Police believe she was returning from a nearby Tesco Extra supermarket when they ran up behind her and forced her to the ground. A passerby heard her cries for help . and ran to her aid. An ambulance took her to hospital but her condition . deteriorated overnight and she died from bleeding on the brain.

Detective Chief Inspector Russell . Taylor said surgeons could not operate because of her frail condition. He added that the attack had been ‘callous and cowardly’. He said Mrs Castle’s recovered handbag contained her purse but her keys were missing. Residents in the quiet cul-de-sac . where Mrs Castle lived for almost 60 years said the local authority is . under pressure to shut the alleyways because they are a magnet for . crime. Paul Honor, 53, said: ‘They are quiet and secluded and attract . crime. If that alleyway had been closed Mrs Castle would still be alive . today.’ He described Mrs Castle as ‘proud and independent’, and added: . ‘Who would do something like that?

BBC staff members have taken to wearing ear plugs after 'noisy' performances were carried out inside the newly-revamped headquarters in London. The complaints over loud music came as the £1billion development of New Broadcasting House, in Portland Place, nears completion. The building was designed to include atrium spaces, which were thought could enable BBC staff and audience members to meet and watch performances. New: The World piazza performance space was designed so audiences and BBC staff members can interact . But the idea has not met with wholehearted approval from staff, who have complained about the noise emanating from inside the headquarters. Oliver Jones, a producer on World of Music on the World Service, wrote to the BBC's magazine Ariel about the matter. He said: 'I work on the seventh floor in New Broadcasting House and the level of noise made it extremely difficult to concentrate on work - you could hear it even with headphones on. Some BBC staff resorted to wearing ear plugs to avoid being distracted by the noise outside . 'It's [atrium] not suitable as a performance space, as the noise gets to so many parts of the building and affects so many people who are trying to work hard. 'Even if it was the loveliest music in the world, there are lots of other distractions in the open plan design and we don't need any more.' According to The Telegraph, another BBC worker said he and his colleagues used ear plugs to drain out the noise. However the BBC have acknowledged the issues raised regarding noise levels. A spokesperson told Mail Online; 'This was a one-off event held in an indoor atrium space. 'We have taken on board staff comments, and as a result, do not plan to hold an event of this kind again in this area of the building. 'This is all part of the natural learning process of settling into a new building.' The outdoor World piazza, which on the other hand will be encouraged to be a performance space, is due to be fully opened from April 2013. Created by Mark Pimlott, the space has been described as a new 'art pavement at the heart of the new central public space', . It consists of more than 750 stone flags inscribed with place names from around the world and there is a subtle scheme of small embedded lights with audio installations. The BBC said: 'This unique public arena will provide a place to linger and see the BBC in action, a performance and exhibition space and a cafe. 'The World reflects the global dimension of the BBC's broadcasting.'","Loud music and noise from atrium areas distracting workers in open-plan environment .

A former member of Ryanair's cabin crew has claimed her working conditions at the budget carrier were 'a total nightmare'. Sophie Growcoot, 20, from Liverpool, worked for the airline after she was employed by Crewlink, a contractor for Ryanair. Despite her initial excitement at the prospect of working for the major airline, she said she became so frustrated with the conditions she took it up with her local MP Luciana Berger. A former member of Ryanair's cabin crew has described working conditions at the budget airline as 'a total nightmare' (file picture) During a debate in the House of Commons this week, Ms Berger raised the issue and accused Ryanair of exploiting its staff. Ms Berger said Ms Growcoot was only paid for 'in the . air' hours, not for pre-flight briefings, sales meetings, turn around . times and time spent on the ground during delays. She said she was told she had to take three months of compulsory unpaid leave each year and was forbidden from taking another job during that time, and had to pay £1,800 for compulsory training. The claims appear to be documented in a Crewlink contract seen by MailOnline. However, Ryanair and Crewlink have dismissed the claims as 'untrue'. Crewlink . Ireland general manager Andrew Swan said Ms Growcoot 'had read, . understood and agreed to and signed this Crewlink Limited contract prior . to commencing work'. Ms Growcoot, who has now left the company, has said she left her job as a waitress to sign a contract with Crewlink - the agency that provides cabin crew staff for Ryanair. Sophie Growcoot worked for the airline after she was employed by Crewlink, a contractor for Ryanair . She claims she was forced to borrow . £450 from her parents to fund the deposit on the £1,800 for compulsory . training for her new job. She said: 'I was really excited about . joining Ryanair’s cabin crew at first, but it was a total nightmare. I . couldn’t believe it when I learnt I wouldn’t be paid for all the time I . was working. 'We’d only be paid when the wheels . were moving, so I didn’t get a penny for the time spent in briefings . before take-off, the turnaround time between flights, or the hours on . the ground when flights were delayed or cancelled.' During a debate in the . House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms Berger said Sophie thought she . had landed her dream job with the airline. She said: 'It was not until she . started that she learned she would not be paid for all the hours she put . in, only the time when a plane she was working on was in the air. MP Luciana Berger (left) accused Michael O'Leary's (right) airline of using the tactics to help achieve record profits of nearly half a billion pounds . 'That meant not a penny for every pre-flight briefing she attended, nothing for sales meetings, nothing for turnaround time when a plane was on the ground between flights, and nothing for the hours waiting on the tarmac during delays and flight cancellations. 'She was only paid for four days each week, and on the fifth day she had to be available on unpaid standby, ready to come in at a moment’s notice but not receiving any payment if not called in. 'Sophie was told that she had to take three months of compulsory unpaid leave each year, and was forbidden from taking another job during that time. 'If she wanted to leave within nine months of joining the company, she had to pay Ryanair a 200 euros administration fee. 'To add insult to injury, she had to pay a staggering £1,800 to her employer for compulsory training. 'Last year, Ryanair recorded profits of just under half a billion pounds. How can its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, think it is fair or acceptable for his company to be profiting on the back of poorly treated staff like Sophie? As her situation grew worse, Sophie knew that there were no other jobs out there for her.' Crewlink general manager Mr Swan said: 'In common with all contractors, Ms Growcoot received flight pay by reference to her scheduled block hours flown, at a rate that is significantly higher than the basic pay received by the airline's full time employees who are paid a lower rate per scheduled block hour, but are paid for all duty time. 'In addition her pay was supplemented by significant sales bonuses arising from sales made by Crewlink Ireland Limited cabin crew on-board our client aircraft.' He said Ms Growcoot's claim she was paid four days a week was untrue. He said: 'She was paid for all block hours flown, in addition to sales bonuses and was accordingly paid for all contract work regardless of whether she flew three, four or five days per week.' He added: 'Ms Berger's claim that ""Ms Growcoot had to pay Ryanair a 200 euros administration fee"" is simply untrue. No payments were made to Ryanair. 'Ms Berger's claim that Ms Growcoot ""had to pay a staggering £1,800 to her employer for compulsory training"" is also untrue. No £1,800 payment was made by Ms Growcoot to Crewlink Ireland Limited for training.' He went on to say: 'It is unfortunate and regrettable that a Member of Parliament such as Ms Berger made no effort or attempt to contact Crewlink Ireland Limited to verify the accuracy of Ms Growcoot's false claim prior to making this inaccurate statement in the Houses of Parliament.' 'How can its chief executive, Michael . O’Leary, think it is fair or acceptable for his company to be profiting . on the back of poorly treated staff like Sophie?' Last month the Daily Mail reported how low-fare airlines now carry the majority of passengers flying from the UK. Of the 93 million passengers who started their journey at a UK airport last year, 52 per cent were flying with budget carriers, according to statistics from travel industry technology company Amadeus. That compared to 48 per cent using no-frills airlines in the previous year. And earlier this month the Daily Mail reported how millions of British Ryanair customers could be entitled to refunds after passenger Simon Couzens won compensation of more than £400. The company had been accused of charging Britons more than passengers booking flights in other countries. The company handed over the money rather than face a race discrimination claim by London-based classical musician Mr Couzens. A snapshot survey at the time revealed the price difference applied to several other Ryanair routes. A spokesman for the airline at the time said: ‘Passengers pay for flights in the currency their flight departs from.’","Former contractor describes working conditions as 'total nightmare'

The report highlights the gulf between the capital’s property market, where prices have reached an all-time high, and the rest of the UK, where they are falling by up to 16.5 per cent a year. In London, the average home now costs £374,568, having soared by 9.6 per cent over the last year, according to the Land Registry. All-time high: House prices in London are rising by £90 a day but are flat or falling in every other major city in the UK . This is equal to around £90 every single day, including weekends. In the most exclusive corner of London - the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea - the average property costs £1.1million, up by an eye-watering £120,000 over the last year. Of all the properties sold for more than £1million in England and Wales, around two-thirds are in London. Around 13 homes every day change hands for more than £1million in the capital, according to the Land Registry, which excludes Scotland. Costly corner: The Royal Borough of Kensington (pictured) and Chelsea have an average property price of £1.1million, up £120,000 over the last year . But the rest of the country tells a . very different story, fuelling an unprecedented property apartheid . between the capital and the rest of the country. The Land Registry figures show prices have dropped over the last year in the vast majority of urban areas. Birmingham, Bolton, Bradford, Bury, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Oldham, Salford, Stockport, Wakefield, Wigan and Wolverhampton are all on the casualty list. For example, house prices in Liverpool have fallen four per cent since last March. The average home used to be worth £93,514 but it has dropped to just £89,974, a fall of £3,720 or £10 a day. Overall, the Land Registry said the average house price in England and Wales is £161,793, up 0.1 per cent in March and up 0.9 per cent over the last year. Outside London, prices are rising in some of the more expensive areas such as Surrey and Windsor and Maidenhead, but falling 16.5 per cent in Middlesbrough. Peter Rollings, chief executive of the estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘House price growth in London continues to surge ahead of the rest of the country with the capital continuing to operate in another realm.’ Giles Hannah, managing director of the upmarket estate agency VanHan, said: ‘There is no getting away from the fact that national average indices conceal significant regional differences. ‘London is undoubtedly the big success story and is doing a good job of pulling up the national average. Casualty list: House prices in Liverpool (pictured) have fallen by four per cent since last March, a fall of £10 a day while in Manchester housing prices fell by £9.05 a day . ‘Its residential sales market remains robust with prices continuing to rise. International buyers, particularly from Asia, are fuelling demand for best in-class properties and are snapping up properties at 10 to 14 per cent discounts as a result of the weakness of sterling compared with their own currencies.’ The majority of people who bought ‘super-prime’ homes in the countryside last year were foreigners, the first time that British buyers have become a minority. The research, by Knight Frank, looked at the nationality of people who bought country homes for £5million or more last year from the upmarket estate agency In 2010 and 2011, foreigners accounted for around 40 per cent of buyers. Last year, it tipped over the 50 per cent mark for the first time to reach 55 per cent. Around one in four buyers came from Russia and its former republics, such as Armenia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

Parents must do more to teach their children right from wrong to stop them becoming criminals, the police watchdog said yesterday. In his first major speech as Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Tom Winsor said it was the duty of all parents and families to turn young people into law-abiding citizens. He also accused mental health services of abdicating their duty to prevent crime, and warned that officers were frustrated with the soft sentences handed out to the criminals they catch. One the beat: Police watchdog Tom Winsor called for better-targeted patrols to 'disrupt and destroy' opportunities to offend, instead of waiting for crimes to happen . And he urged for persistent and dangerous offenders to be put in prison to prevent them committing further crimes. Speaking at the Royal United Services . Institute think-tank  in Whitehall, Central London, Mr Winsor said: . ‘Parents and families as well as schools must instil  in children a . strong appreciation of right and wrong and  the reality and instincts to . behave as responsible law abiding citizens.’ Asked about tackling persistent . criminals, he said that officers must ‘make it as hard as possible to . commit the crime in the first place’. He added: ‘Many many police officers are extremely frustrated at the sentences that are sometimes handed out by the courts.’ He said officers must find ‘persistent prolific and dangerous offenders and take them off the streets’. Mr Winsor argues that money can be saved if crimes can be prevented, eradicating the cost of dealing with offenders in the criminal justice system . ‘If you have them locked up that’s a . pretty good way of preventing crime,’ he added. Mr Winsor warned that . officers were often left to deal with criminals with mental health . problems because the police were regarded as the public service that . would ‘never say no’. As a result, officers’ time was wasted looking after people who should be in the hands of mental health professionals. Mr Winsor, the former rail regulator, . also complained that police were working with primitive equipment that . was ‘next to useless’. A modern version of the Tardis police box, made famous by Doctor Who, could be used as a base for patrolling officers, the Policy Exchange think tank said . On a visit to meet officers on the front line, he found one using a personal electronic organiser that was a decade out of date. He said officers were often putting . technology such as iPhones in their lockers at the start of their shifts . and taking out far inferior equipment to use on the job. Beat officers should have access to . intelligence and other databases while on the beat so they know the . background of the addresses and streets they patrol. He added: ‘In too many respects, the technology which officers have to work with is quite far behind where it could be. ‘It is remarkable that the technology . available to the police, particularly in their interaction with other . parts of the criminal justice system, is as rudimentary and as primitive . as it is. It haemorrhages efficiency.’ Mr Winsor was the first non-police officer appointed Chief Inspector of Constabulary. He was selected seven months ago after . writing two controversial reports for the Home Office into the pay, . conditions and structure of policing.","Crime is not just police's problem, says chief inspector of constabulary .

The Online Network bring many original characters and story lines back to Pine Valley and Llanview, but the shows have the edgier feel of a nighttime soap, according to Entertainment Weekly. The premiere of All My Children jumps five years ahead from the cliffhanger finale in 2011 where a shot was fired in a room . full of people - then cuts to a . hot dream sequence between David (Vincent Irizarry) and Cara (Lindsay .

Story update: The new online episodes of All My Children will be 30 minutes rather than the usual 60, and can be watched on Hulu, Hulu Plus and iTunes . All My Children is the more traditional of the two shows, and even with no Erica Kane there are a lot of familiar faces. Evil David (Vincent Irizarry) is out of prison and still up to no good. Angie and Jesse (Debbi Morgan and Darnell Williams) are still madly in love - but disturbing details emerge involving their daughter Cassandra.

Staff at one of Britain's largest courier companies have been secretly filmed dropping, throwing and kicking customers' parcels. Many of the packages being damaged by workers at UK Mail were labelled 'Fragile' and came from leading internet retailers like Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Dell. Despite a slogan promising to deliver 'quickly, safely and securely', packages at the depot were seen falling from crowded conveyer belts before being mishandled. The shocking footage will confirm the fears of many web shoppers that their expensive purchases are being lost and mistreated by private delivery companies. Across the online shopping industry, problems with deliveries cost businesses an estimated £851million a year. An undercover reporter for tonight's Channel 4 Dispatches programme saw parcels being mishandled every day at the UK Mail plant in Bournemouth. One even narrowly missed his head when it was thrown by another worker. Robert Hammond, from campaign group Consumer Focus, said: 'This shows people quite blatantly, quite openly throwing around items without the least care and consideration. 'This is chaos – as simple as that. There is really no proper management going on in this depot.' Richard Headland, editor of Which? magazine said: 'A lot of us suspect that this kind of thing goes on. To see footage as graphic as that is quite shocking.' On another occasion, depot workers were filmed discussing the possibility of selling bottles of wine from a damaged parcel on the internet auction site eBay. The worker says: 'Hopefully, if they . say “Oh, can you please dispose of them', then we'll be like... [claps . hands] straight on eBay.' See video below . Unsupervised: The TV investigation found that there were rarely any managers on the depot floor . The TV investigation found that there were rarely any managers on the depot floor to make sure staff lived up to the firm's pledges. After viewing the footage, chief executive Guy Buswell apologised to customers and launched an inquiry. 'We need to investigate those clips and see exactly what happened at the time to allow those guys to run amok, which is clearly what they've done,' he said. 'Of course, I'm going to say sorry to the customers affected. We need to investigate it, see what went on, and take a view. 'I'm disappointed with all of it on the basis that we spend an awful lot of time making sure that our staff are well trained.' He added: 'Last year, UK Mail delivered 29 million parcels. I have 486 claims for damage so I would say that clip doesn't really show our business in a true light.' Ministers plan to privatise Royal Mail this year, meaning that letters could soon also be delivered by private companies. In a pilot scheme starting a year ago in West London, TNT became the first firm to deliver post directly to households. Kickabout: A colleague at one of the UK's largest courier companies takes aims at a package . However, another Dispatches reporter working undercover as a TNT postman discovered that he had to leave his bike carrying bundles of mail unattended on busy roads on most days. He also discovered that the post bags were not securely locked to the bike, meaning letters could easily be stolen. Bikes were seen unattended around West London as TNT workers delivered the mail, including one bike carrying letters from firms including Barclays and Thames Water which was left for about 30 minutes. Mr Hammond added: 'Clearly, there's a security angle. Any amount of that post could be easily lifted off the bike and removed. This seems short of the standards that one would expect.' A TNT spokesman said it was improving the locks on panniers and the way they were attached to the bikes. Dispatches was also shown evidence of a TNT postman dumping post in a bin in a park. TNT said the culprit has been sacked. Channel 4's Dispatches: Secrets of Your Missing Mail is screened tonight at 8pm.","Undercover footage from one of UK's largest couriers filmed for Channel 4 .

The results of the report into the care Connor Hodgson will not be published because it could 'distress' him . A council has refused to reveal a review's findings into the care of a teenager who left a ten-year-old girl for dead - because it would cause the attacker 'further distress'. Stockton Borough Council has been accused of a 'cover up' because of its decision, which reviewed the care of Connor Hodgson, who lured the schoolgirl away from friends before beating her repeatedly, throttling her and leaving her on a river bank. She was left covered in blood and beaten so badly part of her head had to be shaved and she needed stitches across her scalp. A review was carried out by Stockton Borough Council after people on the close-knit estate demanded to know why such a dangerous youth had been allowed to live in council care in their midst. However the anticipated publication of the report has been refused because officials are concerned about the effect it might have on the teenager. Hodgson, who was 16-years-old at the time of the attack, was jailed indefinitely last July after he admitted causing the girl grievous bodily harm with intent. Teesside Crown Court was told he throttled her and beat her around the head so viciously he could have killed her. The brutal assault caused such outrage that police were forced to appeal for calm in the days following the incident. The court heard Hodgson, who was in foster care, had a history of petty crime and had shown worrying sexual behaviour as a result of abuse he himself had suffered as a child. He could give no explanation for why he attacked the youngster in April last year. The council has been criticised by James Wharton, Conservative MP for Stockton South, who said their involvement in Hodgson's care should be released. The horrific head injuries sustained by the schoolgirl after she was brutally attacked by teenager Connor Hodgson, who lured her away from her friends and viciously attacked her . He said: 'Given that if there are any details which rightly should be kept private and confidential they could be redacted as is allowed under the Freedom of Information legislation. 'I can see no justification why this information is not released and it is clearly a matter of public interest. 'Many people will see this as an attempt to cover-up what may be a failure to implement any real changes following an extremely serious and worrying case.' The girl, now 11, has left the estate with her family to start a new life in a different country. Her father said: 'He almost killed my daughter. Why was he allowed to be on our estate? 'He should not have been able to run the streets. 'The report should be made public so everyone knows the sort of person he is.' The council explained its decision by saying: 'Given the passage of time and the fact that the criminal proceedings are concluded any disclosure of personal data arising from the councils audit is in my view unwarranted.' The girl's mother said: 'That thug should never have been allowed to live on an estate full of young families.' In refusing to release the internal report, Julie Grant, a reviewing officer for Stockton Borough Council, wrote: 'The review of procedures centred on an audit of social care intervention in respect of a living individual. 'This was not the part of the criminal investigation and as far as I can ascertain was not discussed in open court. 'Given the passage of time and the fact that the criminal proceedings are concluded any disclosure of personal data arising from the councils audit is in my view unwarranted. 'Disclosure would not cause any embarrassment for the council but it is likely to cause further harm and distress to Connor Hodgson.' The council did release the changes it has implemented since the review, which include: .","Report could 'distress' Connor Hodgson, who was jailed for attack .

Justin Bieber’s pet monkey has been given a new home at an animal park in Germany after the teen pop sensation failed to collect him from customs. Baby capuchin Mally was seized by German officials in March when the Canadian singer was unable to provide vaccination and import papers for his monkey. Mally is now settling in at the Serengeti-Park in Hodenhagen where he will soon be able to play with his new capuchin family. Scroll down for video . Not a Belieber: Mally the monkey gives an indication as to his feelings about Justin Bieber's failure to collect him while playing around in his new home . After Justin Bieber failed to reclaim his pet, Mally was sent to the Serengeti-Park, which is home to Germany's only white-headed capuchin family. The tiny monkey was confiscated at Munich airport when Bieber landed for his European tour. When Bieber missed the deadline to send the correct documents for Mally, authorities issued an order transferring ownership of the animal to Germany. Bieber has been under heavy critique from animal experts for keeping such a young monkey as a pet, saying 23-week-old Mally should not have been taken away from his mother until he was a year old. After spending time at an animal shelter, Mally can now be integrated with others of his species and will no longer have to rely on a teddy for company. Monkey lost: Justin's monkey was confiscated by customs officials when the star failed to provide the correct documents when he brought him to Munich for his European tour .

Bieber's 'Baby': Justin Bieber has been criticised for keeping such a young monkey as Mally, as capuchins should stay with their mother for the first year . Mally was taken to the park in secret for his protection, but fans will now be able to visit the animal. ‘He will go into our capuchin monkey enclosure which has lots of trees so it will be a bit of a game to try and recognise him,’ said Dr Fabrizio Sepe, Managing Director of the Serengeti Park. While most animals stay in their transport boxes for the first three days, Dr Sepe says Mally ventured out soon after arrival. ‘He came out straight away and jumped onto the carer's head and was immediately curious about everything.’ Sepe said he had not heard from Bieber but added that he would be happy to give the singer information if he was interested.

Justin Bieber's management has not indicated whether the star will visit his former pet, a 19th birthday present. 'We are making all necessary preparations in order to ensure that Mally has the best possible transition to his new home and has no problems integrating with others of his species’. Due to statutory regulations, Mally first has to be put into a 25-day quarantine before he is allowed to join his new family - and he already has a sibling rival. His new family is made up of three males and three females with the latest addition, Molly, born in February, making Molly and Mally of similar age, much to the delight of the staff at the park. ‘That works out well.

Giving birth is one of the most momentous challenges in a woman's life. For the rare few, it is an unmitigated joy; for most, an excruciatingly painful means to an end. For some women, though, like Sara Bran, childbirth is truly terrifying - but not for the reasons you'd expect. Her two daughters, Lily, 16, and Mia, seven, were born nine years apart in very different circumstances. But common to both births was Sara's sixth sense that something terrible was about to happen. 'On both occasions labour stopped when I was exactly 4cm dilated. Quite simply, I froze with fear and my whole body seemed to go into lockdown. I had to have a traumatic emergency Caesarean section.' Following Mia's birth, Sara, 45, became curious about what could have caused this sudden bolt of paralysing panic, and decided to look into her family history. What she discovered shocked her. A hundred years ago, as her great- grandmother was giving birth to Sara's grandmother, her toddler son's clothing caught alight on an open fire and he came running into the room in flames. He died three days later. It set Sara thinking. The overwhelming panic she'd encountered was sudden and came out of nowhere, probably much like that experienced by her poor relative all those years ago. Could she have inherited the sense of trauma from her great-grandmother? There is no doubt that a woman's . experience of childbirth is often similar to her mother's and . grandmother's. Most doctors and midwives recognise the likelihood that . we will inherit a physiological similarity from our mothers. But could 'ancestral memory' of specific events and experiences also play a part? Sara's labour stopped when she was 4cm dilated with both Lily, now 16, and Mia, now seven . Having interviewed many women for a book I've co-written on the subject, I am convinced the answer is yes. From . the impact of war, to illegitimacy, insanity and other family secrets, . all these have ways of re-emerging down the generations. Sara, who lives in London, questioned . several relatives. 'I became aware, through half-told stories, that . there was a lot of tragedy connected to motherhood in my family . history,' she says. Hence the story of Irene, her paternal great-grandmother and an Irish immigrant in New York in the early 1900s. 'An aunt told me that for the rest of her life, Irene was overwhelmed by the loss of her son,' adds Sara. 'What echoed was the sense I had that birth was synonymous with death, and that if I let my body go, something terrible would happen,' she explains. 'It was as if I still held the horror of what had happened to Irene in my own body.' In 2010, there was a surge of 40 per . cent in the number of women seeking elective Caesareans because they had . experienced trauma during previous births, prompting the NHS to . introduce special birth trauma units and counselling services as well as . funding research into why this is happening. During the bith Roma began to haemorrhage and spent five weeks drifting in and out of a coma . 'It's vital for the NHS to understand . why so many new mothers are left traumatised,' confirms Dr Susan Wray, . head researcher at the Centre For Better Births at Liverpool University. 'This affects so many women, their future fertility and their . psychological well-being.' Holistic . therapist Natalia O'Sullivan, and co-author of my book The Ancestral . Continuum, has experienced the phenomenon herself. Natalia, 49, lives in Somerset with her three children, now aged 14 to 21. She gave birth to her first, Sequoia, at the age of 28. 'I discovered my grandmother had given birth to my mother at 28, and my mother to me at the same age,' Natalia says, 'and my daughter's difficult birth seemed to reflect what my mother and grandmother went through.' Sequoia was born three weeks prematurely, just as her parents were moving house. Natalia was in labour for 37 hours, and her daughter was so jaundiced she had to be kept in hospital for ten days. 'At the time I felt totally alone and unsupported. I ended up with post-natal depression for six months.' When she discussed it with her mother, she found she had experienced similar feelings, though for different reasons. 'My mother was in a foreign country, with few friends and no family. Similarly, when my mother was born, my grandfather was in Mexico on a sabbatical and my grandmother felt abandoned and lonely,' she says. 'I think that came through my mother to me.' Of course, many people will argue that a woman's experience of childbirth is largely down to luck.But there are theories that the chemicals released by the mother during a traumatic birth can fundamentally alter an individual. Such are the similarities between Roma . Norriss's own birth and that of her son, that the 29-year-old is . convinced there is a link. Roma Norriss experienced a traumatic birth when her son Zephyr, now aged 5, was born . Roma had Zephyr, now five, at home in Bath. During the birth she began to haemorrhage and spent five weeks drifting in and out of a coma after getting an infection. She says: 'I was born eight weeks premature and was taken away from my own mother for five weeks and put in an incubator. When I had Zephyr, I believe it was my own birth playing out again.' Fear of giving birth is known as tokophobia . After recovering, Roma began training as a birthing assistant, or doula, and attended many births. So when she became pregnant with daughter Artemis in 2011, she felt confident enough to proceed without consulting a midwife or doctor. After a short, easy labour, she gave . birth last September in a birthing pool at home, with just her husband . and a friend in attendance. However, when Roma registered the birth, . a social services file  was opened alerting the NHS to what they termed . a 'concealed birth', prompting several visits  to her home by . suspicious health visitors.Roma later discovered this, too, had a precedent. For some women childbirth is truly terrifying . She explains: 'I discovered my mother was born in secret. She was the result of an affair that my grandmother had, and although everyone pretended the baby belonged to my grandfather, my grandmother was shunned by society and her husband eventually kicked his wife and her daughter out.' All the women and childbirth practitioners we interviewed for our book said it was important to explore one's family history around giving birth. 'You can eat well, exercise and organise birth pools,' says Roma. 'But if you do not work on clearing the past, you will experience what happened when you were born and your mother was born and so on.' Sara Bran recalls how enlightening it was to unravel the mysteries of her own family line. 'I explored all the stories and family myths I had inherited surrounding motherhood and childbirth,' she says. 'I found out about stillborn babies and children born in secret and surrendered for adoption, and women who struggled as I did to enjoy motherhood. 'I began to understand how ideas of birth can be inherited, just as we inherit the colour of an eye or an aptitude for music.' While . these latter traits can never be changed, there are many who . desperately hope they can influence their birth experience, whether they . believe it's pre-destined or not.

Supermarket giant Tesco will be forced to defend its recent record after sales again slid backwards following the horsemeat scandal and intense competition from rivals. The retailer will come under close scrutiny from investors when it reports financial figures for the first three months of the year on Wednesday. City analysts reckon Britain’s biggest grocer will say underlying sales for the period will have fallen by up to 1 per cent, piling more pressure on chief executive Phil Clarke. Forecasts: City analysts predict Tesco will say underlying sales for the first three months of the year have fallen . Although a small decline, the potential loss of earnings is huge because the group accounts for around £1 in every £8 spent in Britain each year. Tesco has more than 6,700 stores worldwide, including 3,146 in the UK, where it employs the equivalent to over 213,000 full-time workers. Critics believe Tesco’s rapid expansion overseas in countries like Thailand and Hungary meant it took its eye off the ball closer to home. It recently reporting its first annual profits fall in nearly 20 years, down 51.5 per cent to £1.96billion, hit by slowing sales growth and a raft of hefty writedowns. Tesco bosses have insisted UK turnaround plans were on track as it saw the best sales growth for three years in shops open at least 12 months in its final quarter, with growth of 0.5 per cent. But sales are expected to have suffered a relapse as it comes up against price-cutting among rivals and a resurgent performance from Sainsbury’s. Recent figures from Kantar Worldpanel . showed Tesco’s market share slipping to 30.2 per cent in the 12 weeks . to May 12 from 30.8 per cent a year earlier, while smaller rival . Sainsbury’s enjoyed a rise from 16.5 per cent to 16.8 per cent. Tough period: The financial figures forecast are expected to pile more pressure on chief executive Phil Clarke . Philip Dorgan, retail expert at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, is forecasting sales at stores open for at least a year to have slipped by around 1 per cent. He said it was ‘clear that Tesco has not . been one of the recent winners’, although he said the market should not . read too much into one quarter’s lacklustre trading. 'Tesco is on the right track and we expected UK recovery to slowly emerge in 2014' Philip Dorgan, retail expert . The focus is increasingly settling on online capability and less on sales growth, he added. Mr Dorgan believes Tesco’s ‘UK recovery is all about doing 1,000 things 1 per cent better, rather than having a wonderful store format that will save the company’. ‘Tesco is on the right track and we expected UK recovery to slowly emerge in 2014,’ he added. The timing of Easter would have made for a volatile quarter for Tesco and are predicting a robust March to have been offset by more subdued trading in April and May. While the horsemeat crisis has now settled down, analysts believe the scare hit Tesco worse than many of its peers. Didn't work out: Tesco has also taken a £1.2billion hit from its failed foray in America, recently confirming plans to offload its Fresh & Easy business in the US . Tesco has shifted its strategy away from increasing store space to focus more on convenience outlets and online sales when it presented annual results in April. The group has been in recovery mode since falling market share and intense competition prompted the chain’s first profits warning in 20 years in January 2012. That forced Mr Clarke, who started his career stacking shelves in Tesco, to unveil a £1billion overhaul plan in April last year. Mr Clarke has said he is pleased with the progress in the UK, although trading profits in the domestic business fell 8.3 per cent to £2.3billion in the year to February 23. It has also taken a £1.2billion hit from its failed foray in America, recently confirming plans to offload its Fresh & Easy business in the US, while it was left nursing an £804million writedown from the decision to pull its major UK store pipeline. Tesco’s figures will follow new data out today that shows the coldest spring for 50 years left fashion retailers nursing a fall in sales last month as shoppers held off from buying summery outfits. Clothing shops saw like-for-like sales fall 1.4 per cent after a particularly poor final week in May, the BDO High Street Sales Tracker revealed.","Underlying sales for first three months of 2013 forecast to have fallen 1% .

Retired sheep farmer Nicholas Cordery, 62, who is accused of being involved in sex parties involving children and animals. He owned the bungalow where the sex parties are alleged to have taken place . A country farmhouse which hosted depraved sex parties involving children and animals was at the heart of a vile paedophile ring, a court heard today. The isolated building was used as a base where members of the child sex ring would indulge in group sex, bestiality and the abuse of girls as young as eight. It is alleged those involved included a Household Cavalry soldier and his wife, a woman childminder, businessmen and a railway consultant. When police searched the squalid wooden chalet they found drawers filled with sex toys, pornography, a battered-looking teddy bear and a pair of child’s Hello Kitty knickers left next to a butter dish. The bungalow belonged to retired sheep farmer Nicholas Cordery, 62, who along with soldier Simon Davies, was at the centre of a huge police investigation into paedophilia and child pornography. Both men, along with two others, Peter Malpas and Anthony Flack, admitted a string of sex charges when they appeared in the dock at Reading Crown Court. Davies’ teaching assistant wife, 44-year-old Fiona Parsons-Davies, also admitted a charge relating to child cruelty. Sickening details of the case emerged today as the trial of childminder Joanna Gale and rail industry consultant John Connolly started. They are also alleged to have been part of the gang, who met on the internet to discuss their sick fantasies and describe how they had acted them out. The jury was told today that the duo conspired to rape a girl, aged under 13. Gale has also been charged with two counts of sexual activity with the girl as well as helping Connolly to facilitate the rape and sexual assault of the child. This isolated building was used as a base where members of the child sex ring would indulge in group sex, bestiality and the abuse of girls as young as eight . They were also accused of possessing thousands of vile pornographic images of children, and sending some of them to other members of the ring. 'This case is about the sexual abuse of children by a number of people who met on the internet,' said Chrisptopher Donnellan QC, prosecuting. 'They also arranged to meet up in person - that was done in order to take part in various acts of rape and other sexual offences.' Mr Donnellan said that the paedophile ring was infiltrated by undercover police who were able to intercept the messages sent by gang members. He told the jury that the 'central figures' in the case had been Davies - a soldier living in Windsor, Berkshire, and Cordery who owned the farm in Murcott near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The court heard how 37-year-old Davies, himself a father, had groomed and raped a schoolgirl and had taken the youngster to Cordery’s farm where she was abused. Household Cavalry Lance Corporal Davies had boasted online of how he had sex with the child and filmed their encounter, which he sent on to Cordery - who later forwarded the footage to other contacts, including Gale and Connolly. Cordery in return had sent Davies a picture of a bestiality act - to which the squaddie replied 'Thanks for the pic - I’m totally unshockable, bi and love taboo sex. 'I’m into younger and little girls are my fave. Animal sex, dog, pig, horse and goat - I’d love to be filmed with a K9.' The court heard that Cordery had also been communicating with Gale and Connolly about them going to the farm for a 'party' with a pre-teen girl, after they had shared naked photographs of her. They had also sent Cordery pictures of themselves, with married Connolly, 41, posing next to a motorcycle and 35-year-old Gale standing provocatively in a bustier, denim skirt and stockings. Gale and Connolly had left their homes in Warrington, Cheshire, to drive to Wiltshire in February 2011 but turned around when other participants pulled out. 'They stopped when they realised it wasn’t going to be the party they expected and they turned around and went back,' said Mr Donnellan. Undercover police officers had been able to infiltrate the ring and were led to Davies following the arrest of 53-year-old Anthony Flack - who was busted in a sting operation when he agreed to meet an officer posing as another paedophile. The jury heard that police uncovered vile pictures on his computers at home in Windsor, as well as at his Army base in Chicksands, Beds. When Cordery was arrested RSPCA officers seized his seven dogs - many of which had been the subject of the depraved sex parties. When police searched the squalid wooden chalet, they found drawers filled with sex toys, pornography and a battered-looking teddy bear . Gale and Connolly were also traced through computer records including emails sent to and from Cordery and arrested on December 1, 2011 in Warrington, Cheshire. 'During his arrest Mr Connolly was allowed to light a cigarette. As he did the police noticed he closed a laptop that was running,' said Mr Donnellan. When they examined his computer they found a staggering 32,000 indecent images and 18 movies, some of them at level five - the most severe category of child pornography. Police found a chilling video on Connolly’s phone of a man, believed to be Connolly, walking into a room where a little girl was dressed in a short tartan skirt. In the clip shown to the jury, the girl smiled as Connolly said gruffly 'hello you'. In the child’s police interview she said that she had been wearing a short skirt of a similar description when Connolly had sex with her. Her skirt was later found and forensic science experts discovered traces of Connolly’s semen on it. 'She told John Connolly she was scared and he told her not to be,' Mr Donnellan told the court. 'He said he would be scared in his situation but made a joke of it. He said he would get into lots of trouble and he did not want his children’s lives to be ruined.' Following her arrest, Gale said that she had no knowledge of emails sent between her and Connolly, using a shared email address, and Cordery. She also denied abusing a child, or facilitating Connolly’s abuse, and said she had never had any paedophile-related contact with anyone. Although Connolly told police that the duo had been sexual partners, Gale denied that this was true.Connolly also told police that he had been in touch with Cordery but had 'dropped him' when their exchanges became too 'dark.' He put the images found and sent from his computer down to a virus and on the sex assault and rape accusations read a statement protesting his innocence before answering subsequent questions with 'no comment.' Gale and Connolly both deny the charges - all of which were said to have taken place between May 2010 and December 2011. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Building was used as base where members of child sex ring would indulge in group sex, bestiality and abuse of girls as young as eight, it is claimed .

Instead Jackie Sanderson, 22, and new husband Adam, 30, only have two badly-framed and blurry photos taken by guests on a disposable camera to remind them of their special day. The couple agreed to let their friend Ben Fagan - a budding professional photographer - take the pictures to help boost his portfolio.

'We did put disposable cameras on the tables but people didn't use the flash so hardly any have come out. 'All we've been left with is a few shots of the back of our heads after we walked out of the church.' The couple, who met while working at Fowel Hall Hotel in Cornwall, began planning their dream white wedding nine months ago. They invited 60 family and friends from around the world to celebrate with them at St Mary The Virgin Church in Par, Cornwall, on May 25. The newlyweds then enjoyed two days in five star Upton House in Fowey, Cornwall, before spending six days in the Cotswolds. After the wedding, Ben slipped his 16 GB memory card from his camera into his wallet, which he then put into his black suit jacket for a friend's funeral on Friday June 1. But he lost the jacket at the Royal Talbot pub in Lostwithiel as he brawled with a friend in a drunken row - either before or after being thrown out of the pub by the landlord . Mr Fagan, from Lostwithiel, was unable to find the jacket that evening and subsequent searches have failed to turn it up. He said: 'I'm absolutely devastated to have lost my best friends' photos of the best day of their lives. 'It's on my mind constantly. I thought my wallet was the safest place.' Mrs Sanderson, a hotel receptionist, has scoured the town and put up posters appealing for anyone who has seen the memory card and jacket to come forward. She added: 'There are so many memories we won't get back. My dad died two years ago so my mum, Alison Jones, walked me down the aisle instead. 'Two of my sisters were bridesmaids and I know there were so many lovely pictures. I am so desperate to see them. 'People have suggested doing a mock wedding to take more photos but we just can't afford it and it is not the same.' The couple are hoping to leave for a two-year trip to New Zealand in late July and say it would be a 'dream come true' to have the pictures before they leave.","Jackie Sanderson, 22, and new husband Adam, 30, have only been left with a few fuzzy shots of their special day in Par, Cornwall .

Cost: Many single people said they would travel on their own if the prices were not geared towards couples, families or groups of friends . Nearly half of those who are single in Britain did not take a holiday last year with many blaming the travel industry for pricing them out of the market. They believe costs for travelling on your own make it too expensive to go abroad. Many said they would travel on their own if the prices were not geared towards couples, families or groups of friends, according to analysts Mintel. It found 45 per cent of those who are either not married, divorced or widowed did not take a foreign holiday in 2012. This compares to just 28 per cent of married adults who did not go away last year, said the study. Package holidays in particular, as well as accommodation, car hire and other accessories, are generally a lot more expensive for anyone travelling on their own or in odd numbers. Many packages add single person supplements for those not sharing a room and other hotels charges rates by the room so two sharing pay half as much as a person on their own. Only 12 per cent of Britons say personal safety puts them off going away on their own - rising to 19 per cent of women and falling to five per cent of men. Almost half, 49 per cent, of single adults say it is the cost that deters them from travelling while three in four say the travel industry does not cater well for single travellers. Around half say the lack of holiday packages for single people deters them from going away on their own - only 20 per cent are put off travelling by having no one to go with. Census figures suggest 53 per cent of the adult population of England and Wales are either unmarried, divorced or widowed, up from 32 per cent in 1971. Of these, almost 12 per cent are not strictly single as they are cohabiting with a partner - but the rest are on their own, which amounts to 41 per cent, or more than four in ten adults. Priced out: Almost half of Britain's single adults say it is the cost that deters them from travelling abroad . John Worthington, Mintel Senior Travel Analyst said: 'Singles remain under-represented in the leisure travel market. 'Major tour operators are investing in ""couples-only"" brands but the perception of the majority of singles (especially older singles) is that the industry has little to offer them beyond escorted group tours which are not to everyone's taste. 'Brands that can speak to this growing demographic - especially single young professionals and divorced/widowed over-55s - are likely to be rewarded with loyalty.'","Forty-five per cent of single Britons did not travel abroad last year .

Austerity is devastating the health of people in Europe and North America by driving suicide, depression, and the spread of infectious disease, according to new research. It is also reducing access to medicines and care which is further affecting people’s health, the study suggests. The authors, Oxford University political economist Dr David Stuckler and Dr Sanjay Basu, an assistant professor of medicine and an epidemiologist at Stanford University, said their findings show austerity is seriously bad for health. In a book to be published this week, the researchers say that more than 10,000 suicides and up to a million cases of depression have been diagnosed during what they call the ‘Great Recession’ and its accompanying austerity across Europe and North America. They also claim that in Greece, moves like cutting HIV prevention budgets have coincided with rates of the AIDS-causing virus rising by more than 200 per cent since 2011. They suggest that the 50 per cent youth employment rate has also increased drug abuse which has further increased the spread of HIV. The study also revealed that Greece experienced its first malaria outbreak in decades following budget cuts to mosquito-spraying programmes. The researchers added that more than five million Americans have lost access to health care during the latest recession, while in Britain, some 10,000 families have been pushed into homelessness by the government's austerity budget. ‘Our politicians need to take into account the serious - and in some cases profound - health consequences of economic choices,’ Dr Stuckler told Reuters. ‘The harms we have found include HIV and malaria outbreaks, shortages of essential medicines, lost healthcare access, and an avoidable epidemic of alcohol abuse, depression and suicide,’ he said. ‘Austerity is having a devastating effect.’ The researchers claim that the youth employment rate has also increased drug abuse which has further increased the spread of HIV . Previous studies by Dr Stuckler have . also linked rising suicide rates in some parts of Europe to biting . austerity measures, and found HIV epidemics to be spreading amid . cutbacks in services for vulnerable people. But Dr Stuckler and Dr Basu said negative public health effects are not inevitable, even during the worst economic disasters. Using data from the Great Depression of the 1930s, to post-communist Russia, and from some examples of the current economic downturn, they say financial crises can be prevented from becoming epidemics - if governments respond effectively. As an example, they say Sweden's active labour market programmes helped the numbers of suicides to fall there during its recession while neighbouring countries with no such programmes saw large increases in suicides. ‘Ultimately what we show is that worsening health is not an inevitable consequence of economic recessions. It's a political choice,’ Dr Basu said. This is not the first study to suggest that austerity can affect people’s health. Researchers at the University of Alcala . in Madrid found that it actually improved the health of many people in . Cuba during the early 1990s. They discovered that food and fuel shortages in the country caused the average citizen to lose 11lb and that death rates from heart disease and diabetes had fallen considerably. Professor Manuel Franco, of the University of Alcala, Madrid, said: 'We found a population-wide loss of 4-5 kg in weight in a relatively healthy population was accompanied by diabetes mortality falling by half and mortality from coronary heart disease falling by a third.'","Austerity reduced access to medicines and health care in Europe and U.S .

For centuries, there's been no official French word for the sloppy Gallic export 'to French kiss' — though that certainly hasn't stopped any citizen from doing so. Now the oversight has been rectified. The one-word verb 'galocher' - to kiss with tongues - is among new entries added to the 'Petit Robert' 2014 French dictionary, which hit the shops Thursday. Ooh la la! After centuries of lacking a French word for the sloppy Gallic export 'to French kiss,' the verb 'galocher' has finally been given its rightful place in the French dictionary . It may surprise many that France - a country famed for its amorous exploits and which gave the world sex-symbol Brigitte Bardot, romantic photographer Robert Doiseau and even scandal-hit former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn - is only just linguistically embracing the popular pastime. Yet Laurence Laporte of the Robert publishing house says that it's just the way language evolves. 'We always had many expressions to describe ""French-kissing,"" like ""kissing at length in the mouth,"" but it's true, we've never had one single word,' she said. 'We always had many expressions to . describe French-kissing, but . we've never had one single word' The term 'French kiss' - once also . called a 'Florentine kiss' - is popularly considered to have been . brought back to the English-speaking world by soldiers returning from . Europe after World War I. At the time, the French had a reputation for . more adventurous sexual practices. Laporte said 'galocher' was a slang term that's been around for a while 'but only now is it being officially recognized in a French dictionary.' 'La galoche' is an ice-skating boot, so the new term riffs evocatively on the idea of sliding around the ice. The word expert added a caveat about the power of language. The lack of a specific term 'never stopped us from doing it,' Laporte noted.","The term 'French kiss' is believed to have been brought to the English-speaking world by soldiers returning from Europe after World War I .

For the millions who watched back in 1999, Nupur Lala's face is frozen in time, because the year she won the bee, movie makers were shooting 'Spellbound,' the Oscar-winning documentary about the competition released in 2002. As this year's spelling bee drew closer Lala reflected on her life since winning the Bee 14 years ago and the legacy she left behind for young competitors. Nupur Lala won the National Spelling Bee at age 14 in 1999. She became famous after she was featured in the 2002 Oscar-winning documentary on the bee 'Spellbound' For those who saw the film Lala will always be the 14-year-old girl from Tampa, Florida, with the glasses and dark shoulder-length hair, her arms raised while leaping for joy. She became a role model for those who realized it's OK to be nerdy. Since the film was made the bee's popularity has skyrocketed, in part because of Lala and . the other spellers featured in 'Spellbound,' a film that . made smart people cool long before CBS's 'The Big Bang Theory.' Lala also became a trend-setter, starting a run in which 10 of 14 national bee winners have been Indian-American, including the last five. Today, she's 28 and finishing up a master's degree in cancer biology with plans to enroll in the University of Texas Medical School in Houston, having changed course from a career plan that had her researching memory and the brain for three years at MIT. She now aspires to be a physician scientist. Nupur Lala, now 28, writes out her winning Spelling Bee word 'logorrhea' on a board at The University of Michigan where she earned her undergrad degree . 'My intellectual inspirations are so meandering. I blame that on the Spelling Bee sometimes,' Lala said with a laugh. 'There are so many interesting things in the dictionary to study.' Lala will be watching this week when the 86th Scripps National Spelling Bee takes place near the nation's capital. Her friends tease that her life 'shuts down' during the bee, but she'll see a spectacle that's changed much since she graced the stage. The finals are now broadcast in prime time. A  vocabulary test is being added this year for the first time. 'I'm amazed at the sea change,' Lala said. 'Because when I was a speller, that was one thing you totally hid. I remember like not even wanting to tell people what I was doing over the weekend when I was competing in the regional spelling bee. It was that big of a liability. And now I see that, yeah, people want to be nerds. I think that's great.' Nupur Lala jumps for joy after winning the National Spelling Bee in 1999. Since her win 10 of the 14 national bee winners have also been Indian-American . Lala is the first to say that winning . the national bee has been an overwhelming positive in her life, even if . does get tiresome to have people repeatedly asking her to spell her . winning word  'logorrhea,' or to realize that her reputation can . unfairly put her on a pedestal in an academic setting. 'I've . had people say 'I expect more of you because I've seen what you are . capable of,'' Lala said. 'And that's a huge honor and also very . daunting.' Then there's another set of emotions she feels every year when her name is mentioned by the Indian-Americans youngsters who now dominate the national bee. All of the recent winners, to some degree, have cited Lala as an inspiration. 'It's absolutely overwhelming,' she said. 'And I think especially as I've grown older and seeing how much I've wanted to emulate people in my life. Yeah, it's very humbling every time I hear that. It feels like a lot of responsibility, to be perfectly honest. You become very conscious of that.' Nupur Lala was the winner of The National Spelling Bee the year it was filmed for an Oscar-winning documentary 'Spellbound.' After the movie's release Lala was rocketed to fame . There have also been a . disproportionate number of recent winners interested in the brain and . medicine, including several who said they wanted to grow up to be . neurosurgeons. Lala . pursued an undergraduate degree in brain, behavior and cognitive . sciences at the University of Michigan, in part because of her . experiences from the bee. 'Why do I remember certain words and not others? Why isn't my memory so good for everything else?' she said. 'That question sort of drew me into research.' At least much of the terminology was familiar. After studying all those big words for the bee, a standard vocabulary test is a breeze. I remember taking the GRE years ago,' she said, 'and how I had such an edge over other competitors because I basically studied the vocabulary component for the Spelling Bee.' National Spelling Bee champions are a small and tight-knit group. Lala keeps tabs with many of her fellow winners, and she marvels that she had the nerve to pull off her win all those years ago. Two years ago a 26-year old Nupur Lala spoke to a local Tampa, Florida television station about her life since winning the Bee in 1999. She is currently studying cancer biology at MIT . She turned down a chance to be featured on an MTV reality show that wanted to follow her through college; she wasn't comfortable with the idea and didn't feel she was crazy enough to be interesting.

Rebecca Leighton is attempting to sue Greater Manchester Police over allegations they gave the public access to her Facebook account and leaked her name to the press . A nurse cleared of poisoning patients is attempting to sue the police for £100,000 after officers allegedly leaked her name to the Press and made her private Facebook account available to the public. Rebecca Leighton spent six weeks in custody as police investigated the deaths of several patients from suspected saline drip contamination. After being charged with contaminating saline fluids with insulin, Ms Leighton was refused bail for her own protection. But the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges because of a lack of sufficient evidence against her. The Times has now reported that in a High Court writ the nurse has alleged officers asked for her Facebook password following her arrest so it could be closed down 'to minimise the potentially damaging intrusion into her private life and avoid prejudicing public opinion towards her'. But it is alleged an officer reset the password and deactivated then reactivated the account, which meant her previously private page was made available to all internet users. Ms Leighton's family and solicitor were also allegedly unable to shut the page down because the password had been changed. The nurse has claimed officers gave her name to the media, who obtained messages and pictures from her Facebook account, while 'highly abusive and distressing' messages were also posted by members of the public. It is also alleged officers obtained confidential information from her Hotmail account after she gave her password so it could be shut down. She is now seeking compensation of up to £100,000 for aggravated damages for breach of confidence, misuse of private information, negligence and breach of a statutory duty and her legal costs. The 29-year-old says the publicity resulted in her being remanded in custody and has left her unable to find work. She alleges she has also had to abandon a business venture which has lost her £22,157. In February she was suspended for three months by a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel after she admitted stealing drugs. The panel found her fitness to practice impaired following a disciplinary hearing in which she suggested staff habitually took medication from the premises. Ms Leighton sobbed gently as the . panel, sitting in London, said the 'relatively short' suspension would . be the best course of action as she had shown remorse, had done the best . to atone for actions and was unlikely to repeat her misconduct. Colleagues also had confidence in her as a nurse, it noted. Panel . chairman Susan Hurds said: 'We are satisfied that Ms Leighton has . learned a tremendous amount from the experience and we are satisfied she . would not repeat her actions.' Probe: A police investigation into deaths at Stepping Hill (above) led to the arrest of Ms Leighton. Charges against her were subsequently dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence . The disciplinary panel found that she was 'not fundamentally dishonest' and had worked hard to mediate her conduct since the incident. Ms Hurds said she had sought no intentional financial benefit and had a 'previously unblemished nursing career'. In September 2011, following her release from jail, Ms Leighton told ITV's This Morning how she was too frightened to walk down the street alone. She said she had been portrayed as an 'Angel of Death' following her arrest. She said the ‘normal life’ she enjoyed before she was arrested had been destroyed.

Labour Cabinet ministers tried to sexually assault female politicians, Shirley Williams claimed today. The former Education Secretary claimed that ‘more than one’ senior government figure launched assaults in the 1970s. She said the attacks were ‘worse than groping’ but she did not speak out because of the view that politics is ‘not a soft business’. Assault: Baroness Williams said that as a Labour minister she was pursued by older men in government in the 1970s . Baroness Williams served in Labour governments from 1974 to 1979, before later quitting the party to set up the SDP and later the Liberal Democrats. The 82-year-old has repeatedly spoken out to defend former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard, who faces a string of sex assault claims against him from party staff and activists. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing. Baroness Williams revealed that as a female politician serving at the top of government in the 1970s she was frequently pursued by older men. Claims: Baroness Williams defended former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard against sexual harassment claims, saying he was 'a very fine man' Allegations of the serious assaults, committed by Cabinet ministers, come at a time when police are also investigating numerous showbusiness stars over claims of sex attacks during the 1970s. But Baroness Williams said she did not speak out at the time, because she would have been dismissed for not accepting it was part of life in Westminster at the time. ‘As a woman MP I spent a great deal of my youth being pursued by senior gentlemen,’ she told The Sun. ‘It was much worse than groping, it was assaulting. ‘If I'd said, “I've been pursued around the filing cabinets by Mr X” — and Mr X did exist and he was a Cabinet Minister — they'd have said, “For God's sake, this isn't what politics is about, it's not a soft business”.’ Asked by the newspaper to name the minister, Baroness Williams replied: ‘No. There was more than one.’ She was Prices and Consumer Protection Secretary under Harold Wilson, and later Paymaster General and Education Secretary in Harold Wilson’s government from 1976 to 1979. She quit the Labour party in 1981,and was part of the famous Gang of Four – with Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Bill Rodgers – who set up the SDP, which later merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to create the Liberal Democrats. Baroness Williams again defended Lord Rennard, who was the Lib Dem chief executive from 2003 to 2009. She said: ‘Chris has been a rock to the Liberal party, he's been an absolutely critical factor in our success.’ Minister: Baroness Williams was Education Secretary in the Labour government from 1976-79, before quitting the party to set up the SDP . In February Baroness Williams came to the defence of Lord Rennard, after it emerged sexual harassment claims him had been a factor in his early retirement. Nick Clegg promised a party inquiry and in April Scotland Yard began a criminal inquiry, interviewing up to 20 potential victims and witnesses. But Baroness Williams, one of the most senior Lib Dem women, said the situation had been ‘hopelessly exaggerated’ and insisted Lord Rennard was ‘a very fine man’. However, she did say that women in Parliament were ‘not treated very fairly’ and said the Commons was a ‘very bullying place, a very masculine culture’.","Ex-Education Secretary says she was pursued by older men in 1970s .

Joanne Scott, who poured milk over a distressed baby's face and said 'that's for throwing up on me', a hearing was told . A midwife poured milk over a distressed baby's face and said 'that's for throwing up on me', a hearing was told today. Joanne Scott also photographed the child on her mobile phone because her husband and daughter would 'find it funny', it is claimed. Scott was working a night shift at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in 2008 when the baby became unsettled. She went over to calm it down but then took a photograph, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Derek Zeitlin, for the NMC, said: 'When questioned about it by her colleague, told her that she would send it to her husband and her daughter who would find it funny. 'The baby was in quite an unsettled state and the registrant took the baby rather roughly in her hands and as a result of that the baby was sick over her. 'Scott's colleague put the baby back and remonstrated with the registrant about the rough handling and took the baby in her arms. 'The registrant went away and came back with a bottle of milk which her colleague saw without a teat on it. 'Scott poured that over the baby, saying ""that's for throwing up on me.""' The other member of staff was at first afraid to say anything as she was a junior and only reported the incident a few months later. Scott is also accused of swearing at the husband of a woman giving birth on October 11, 2010. The midwife had previously sent the mother home after claiming that she was not in labour. Mr Zeitlin continued: 'The upshot of that was that when the mother did eventually give birth she did so in the ambulance taking her back to the hospital. 'Her husband was with her at the time and he was very scared as to what was going on. 'When they arrived at the hospital there was a conversation which took place between the father and the registrant, part of which was overheard by a colleague. 'The father explained that he was very scared and she had no idea why he was scared because she had explained what he had to do when they got home. 'She made the comment ""did you nearly sh*t yourself"" and after a reply by him, ""that is because you're f***ing useless.""' Scott was working a night shift at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in 2008 . The same month Scott breached professional boundaries by befriending on Facebook a mother who had just given birth at the hospital, it is claimed. On 18 October 2010 Scott used her mobile phone to take a photo of another baby, referred to as Baby C, when there was specialist camera equipment available, it is alleged. Baby C was suffering from a condition that meant it was half one colour and half another and Scott claimed she had to show the paediatrician. But the midwife did not get consent from the mother and did not write any notes in the medical records about showing the photo to a paediatrician. The photo was then not deleted in a 'prompt manner' from her mobile phone. The midwife admits adding a mother as a friend on Facebook and all charges against her relating to Baby C. She also admits swearing at the husband of a mother in labour once but denies saying 'that's because you're f***ing useless'. Scott denies all the other charges and claims her fitness to practice has not been impaired. If found guilty of misconduct she could be thrown out of the profession. The hearing continues.","Hearing told Joanne Scott also 'photographed the child on her phone'

Fortunately for the city's populace, the vertigo-enducing image is a publicity stunt for a new musical production of King Kong, which open's next month at the Regent Theatre. The furry hand was hoisted to the 88th floor of Eureka Tower, a 297.3-metre skyscraper located in the Southbank precinct of Melbourne. Vertigo: Stunt expert Leigh-Anne Vizer is held by a giant King Kong hand 300 metres above the city of Melbourne during a PR stunt .

The hand had been constructed around the Eureka building management unit, used to clean the tower's windows, and Ms Vizer was lowered from the roof in the hand.

A former Coronation Street actor 'used his status' to 'flatter and gain the trust' of a 14-year-old boy whom he went on to indecently assault on a number of occasions, a court heard today. Andrew Lancel, 42, best known for his role as Frank Foster in the ITV soap, is accused of six counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of 16. The charges relate to one male victim and the offending allegedly took place between 1993 and 1994 when he was aged 14 and 15, Liverpool Crown Court heard. It allegedly occurred before the actor joined Coronation Street in 2010. Accused: Andrew Lancel, pictured with his wife Louise Edge, arrives at Liverpool Crown Court today where he is standing trial accused of abusing a boy under 16 . Kim Whittlestone, prosecuting, said the abuse started when the actor visited a theatre group in his home town of Southport, Merseyside, where he got to know the victim. She said the boy was 'starstruck' by Lancel, from Liverpool, who had just landed a role in the television series Cardiac Arrest. The court heard that Lancel would 'compliment' the boy, telling him he had talent and 'could go places'. The actor, then aged 23, then allegedly started taking the teenager for coffees. Soap star: Andrew Lancel, left, playing Frank Foster in Coronation Street with Sally Dynevor as Sally Webster . Actor: Liverpool-born star Andrew Lancel, is most famous for appearing in Coronation Street as Frank Foster. He is pictured here with Alison King as Carla Connor . That progressed on to them going back to his house where the alleged offending was said to have started. Miss Whittlestone said: 'The prosecution case is that the defendant used his status as an actor at that time to flatter and gain the trust of the victim. 'He knew he was under the age of consent but despite that would progress their relationship and made it sexual - something that he knew as an adult of 23 years of age was wrong.' Lancel denies that any sexual contact ever took place and instead says he acted as a 'sort of mentor' to the boy. Other role: Lancel plays Detective Inspector Neil Manson in The Bill . At the start of the trial Judge Clement Goldstone QC, the Recorder of Liverpool, told the jury of eight women and four men: 'The defendant Andrew Watkinson is also known as Andrew Lancel. 'He is a television actor who had appeared in programmes such as Coronation Street, Heartbeat and other soaps. 'You may therefore recognise him by sight but mere recognition as opposed to personal knowledge need not worry you and would not be a reason for not proceeding in this trial.' Lancel was charged last November under his birth name Andrew Watkinson. The actor, wearing a light grey suit, white shirt and grey tie, denies all six charges. The case continues.

David Hamnett (pictured) was being treated for sleep apnoea, a condition that can halt breathing during sleep around the time when his car crashed on the M5 . A drunken driver who crashed his car at 100mph has avoided jail after telling a court he was ‘sleep driving’. David Hamnett, 47, had been drinking whisky and wine before getting behind the wheel of his Volvo S40 while, he claimed, he was still asleep. He travelled 150 miles at up to 100mph before rear-ending another vehicle and slamming into a motorway’s central barrier. The marine engineer was cut free from the wreckage wearing a  T-shirt and jogging bottoms with bare feet. He was found to be almost twice the drink-drive limit. Hamnett told a court he had been ‘sleep driving’ after getting into his car to drive to Devon, where he works during the week, from his home in Ormskirk, Lancashire. He said he must have been asleep during the entire drive before the crash in Worcestershire in the early hours. The married father of two told Shrewsbury Crown Court he had put his ‘sleeping clothes’ on to go to bed and woke up to find himself in the smash on the M5. However Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre, said it was ‘highly unlikely’ he could have been asleep behind the wheel without crashing for two hours. Judge Peter Barrie accepted Hamnett had a sleeping disorder and that it was possible he may have got into his car while asleep. But he said he had likely carried on with the journey after waking. Hamnett was convicted of dangerous driving and given a 12-month community order, banned from driving for six months and ordered to take an advanced test. Judge Barrie said of the crash in the early hours of Saturday July 9, 2011: ‘This was a highly dangerous incident at high speed, weaving on a motorway and causing an accident in which you and the occupants of another car suffered significant injuries. An aggravating feature was that you were well over the drink-drive limit.’ Sleepwalking: David Hamnett was found guilty of dangerous driving at Shrewsbury Crown Court . Hamnett claimed he travelled the entire 150 miles in a state of ‘parasomnia’. Dr John O’Reilly, from the North West . Regional Sleep Service, based at Aintree University Hospital in . Liverpool, confirmed he had undergone treatment for sleep disorders. But prosecution witness Dr Idzikowski . said it was ‘highly unlikely’ that anyone could have negotiated a . 150-mile journey without waking up. Hamnett, who was sentenced last week, . said yesterday that he had driven home from Plymouth to Lancashire on . the Friday then gone to bed after a drink with his wife Janet, a nurse. He insisted he had woken trapped inside his mangled car and still has no recollection of how he ended up there. At the time of the accident Hamnett – . who fractured his spine and spent a month in hospital – was undergoing . treatment for sleep apnoea, a condition that affects breathing while . asleep. He continued: ‘I’d had a few episodes where I had woken up to find myself walking around the house. ‘I’d not thought that much about it . because it was so infrequent. It turned out that sleep driving was . actually quite common also. I think it’s a long, straight road and . driving along it is a fairly simple task. ‘I was in my pyjamas, I had no money . and wallet, and I had just driven all the way back from work so why on . earth would I want to go back there on a Saturday morning?’ The research and development director for a marine engineering firm has dropped from 24stone to 15stone since the crash. He says the weight loss seems to have cured his sleep problems and curbed his sleepwalking.","Marine engineer David Hamnett was twice the drink drive limit .

The former abattoir worker, who has been jailed for the rest of his life for killing the five-year-old, refuses to reveal what he did with her body. But the sighting could hold the key to where he left her remains, it has been reported. Murderer Mark Bridger, who has refused to reveal what he did with the body of April Jones, was spotted driving up a remote country lane on the night she went missing . Hotel owner Gordon Holt, 58, has said he believes he spotted the killer driving up a remote lane towards woodland . Hotel owner Gordon Holt, 58, has told the Daily Mirror he believes he spotted the killer driving up a remote lane towards woodland as he returned home towards Corris, near Machynlleth, at about 11pm that night. He said: 'When I looked over I identified it as a blue Land Rover, and from what I could see it appeared to be a left-hand drive which I thought was strange.' Mr Holt said at the time he spotted the car he was not aware April was missing. He found out she had been taken the following morning. He said: 'But it was not until we heard the description of Bridger's vehicle that I put two and two together that it could have been him.' Mr Holt said he then told the police about what he had seen. Dyfed Powys Police has confirmed the sighting was investigated at the time. The blue Land Rover belonging to killer Mark Bridger . Mr Holt said the lane, which winds back to Bridger's cottage, leads to a dense forest with hidden wartime bunkers. April's parents Coral and Paul Jones last week begged Bridger to reveal what he did with her body. Bridger's friends have revealed the oddball killer would often camp alone near his home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, with only a crate of super strength lager Special Brew or cider for company. And they told The Sun that Bridger regularly liked to discuss where he would conceal a body. 'He did know the woods and hills around here very well because he'd spend all his time in the wild,' they said. Mark Bridger leaves Mold Crown Court after he was given a whole life sentence for the abduction and murder of schoolgirl April Jones . The murderer was described by Mr Justice Griffith Williams at Mold Crown Court last week as a 'pathological and glib liar' and a 'paedophile who for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls' as he was given a rare whole life sentence. Justice Griffith-Williams also asked him to reveal what he did with April's body for the sake of her parents. On October 1 last year Bridger snatched and murdered April, five, on the Bryn-Y-Gog estate, in Machynlleth, Powys, before 'lying through his teeth' by claiming he accidentally hit her with his car and was so drunk he did not know what happened to the body. But after a five-week trial it took the jury just four hours to decide Bridger was a fantasist, obsessed with child murder and child pornography, who had lured disabled April into his car, before killing her.","Hotel owner spotted Bridger on night April disappeared .

Victim: Cameron Smithies, 15, fell to 80ft to his death while standing near the cliff edge at Slains Castle . A 15-year-old boy fell 80 feet to his death from a cliff face near a ruined Scottish castle that is thought to have been the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula. Cameron Smithies is believed to have lost his footing while standing close to the edge at Slains Castle, Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire. An RAF rescue helicopter was scrambled to the scene and the teenager was airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but he died around 24 hours later. Cameron, who would have turned 16 this Thursday, fell on Saturday afternoon. Police said the death is believed to have been a tragic accident. Squadron Leader David Webster, . from the Search and Rescue Squadron of RAF Lossiemouth, said that they winched the teenager to safety, although he later died. He said: 'The crew were called to . reports of a 15-year-old male cliff-faller and were told that coastguard . teams, paramedics and a lifeboat crew were already in attendance. 'Reports indicated that the casualty . had fallen 80ft followed by another shorter fall into a gully - . sustaining significant injuries. 'Due to the nature of where he had . ended up, coastguard crew and paramedics abseiled into the gully and our . winchman used 160ft of cable to reach them. 'The winchman assessed the casualty and put him on a stretcher, before he was extracted and flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.' A Police Scotland spokesman . said: ‘Cameron Smithies, 15, has died at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary . following a fall from Slaines Castle, Cruden Bay, Peterhead at around 5pm on Saturday. 'Investigations are continuing into this accident and a report . will be submitted in due course to the Procurator Fiscal.’ As Cameron's family and friends began paying . tribute, his auntie Caroline wrote on Facebook: 'RIP Cameron Scott . Smithies you were the best nephew and taken . from us far to soon rest easy now xxxx.' Death: Cameron, 15, was walking near the cliff face at Slains Castle which overlooks the North Sea when he fell to his death (file picture) Peterhead Canoe Club chairman Daryn Hubbucks said that Cameron, a keen canoeist, from Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, had a 'zest for life'. He said: 'I had the sad news today that Cameron Smithies died of his injuries after falling off cliffs at Slains Castle. 'Cameron was a cheeky wee monkey . with a big heart and zest for life, he was just starting out in life and . getting his kayak feet, Cameron was just well up for anything.' Victim: Cameron Smithies, 15, fell at around 5pm on Saturday afternoon and died 24 hours later after being taken to hospital . Overlooking the North Sea, the 16th century Slain Castle is thought to have been the inspiration for Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. The author wrote some of the famous novel while staying at Crookit Lum Cottage in nearby Cruden Bay in 1895. It is thought he visited the castle during that time as a guest of William Hay, 19th Earl of Errol. Although Dracula is based in a castle in Transylvania, Romania, the Scottish ruin is thought to have provided the author with some of his inspiration. Despite its literary links, there were plans to turn the abandoned castle into flats in 2007. However, they were abandoned in 2009 following a property downturn. Bran Castle, in Romania, is marketed as 'Dracula's Castle'. However, there is no evidence that Stoker ever knew it existed - although it has appeared in Dracula films. One canoeist, Malcolm Brown, wrote: 'This . is really devastating sad news. He was a likeable friendly guy and fun . to have along on the river trips. Sorry for the loss of such a young . star.' Friends and schoolmates also paid tribute to Cameron. Jemma Mckenzie added: 'RIP Cameron, can’t believe it, you’ll be missed. 'Actually still can’t get my head . round that your gone, horrible to think how we were speaking the other . day and never going to speak again. 'Heaven certainly has gained another angel, rest in peace.' Just two weeks ago a lifeboat crew . from Peterhead were called out to Slains Castle, which overlooks the North Sea, when a pet dog fell . 60ft down nearby cliffs and later died from its injuries. Constable Matthew Roger of the Buchan . local policing team warned parents to make sure their children stay away . from the dangerous cliffs. He said: 'Whilst a popular attraction . to many, I would like to highlight the particularly hazardous nature of . the ruins at Slains Castle. 'Members of the public are encouraged . to take great care at this site and parents are asked to ensure they are . aware and take efforts to prevent their children playing here . unsupervised.'

Mark Spencer, Conservative MP for . Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, said the figures were evidence that a 'compensation . culture' has spread to the force. He said: 'We have lost the plot in terms of what we think it is acceptable to claim for. 'We are inundated with ambulance-chasing adverts on TV for no-win no-fee services. 'If you slip on ice while you are at home you are a dozy twit - if you do it at work all of a sudden it's someone else's fault.' Retired policeman Ray Egan, 75, . yesterday criticised the payouts and said he was 'surprised' officers . had become part of a compensation culture 'sweeping the nation'. Mr Egan, who served with West . Midlands Police from 1967 to 1993, said: 'It's all to do with this claim . culture, it's like a disease and people are jumping on the bandwagon. I don't know where it is going end. 'I'm surprised the blame culture has . spread to the police force. But everybody else is jumping on board, so . it's just human nature. 'It's costing the country a lot of money, it could be spent on policing and put to much better use. 'It's crazy really. What we need back is the man on the beat, it's become an endangered species. 'They can't stop people claiming, it's just going to go on and on. I'm just glad I'm retired and out of it.' In total £446,999 has been paid out by the Nottinghamshire Police to injured officers and civilian staff. Paddy Tipping, Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire, added: 'The force need to take a firm but fair line on this. 'Police officers when they join know . they are taking on a demanding and dangerous role and know getting . injured is a real possibility. 'But at the same time if the force has been negligent we need to satisfy that and pay a fair degree of compensation.' But Phil Matthews, chairman of . the Nottinghamshire branch of the Police Federation, defended the right . of officers to make claims. He said: 'You do not get thousands of . pounds because you have tripped over something - you get it because you . have suffered a serious injury. 'If you went to any other organisation . that employed about 4,000 people over a number of sites and asked them . how many claims had they had, I think we could fair quite well. 'This information does not give the details of what can be nasty, life-changing injuries. Our members should have the same rights as anyone in any other organisation.' Meanwhile figures reveal the Humberside Police has received 44 compensation claims from officers and staff between January 2010 and March this year. Of those, 16 claims have been successful . and ten were rejected. The others are still ongoing. Although most . claims had been brought by officers, some had been made by civilian . members of staff. Dangerous job: Nottinghamshire Police has also made six payouts - including one £17,826 settlement - to officers who have been bitten by the force's own dogs (stock image) John Blanchard, chair of the Humberside . Police Federation, added most officers are reasonable and will not claim . for compensation unless it is necessary. He said: 'Officers are entitled to the same protection as any other member of the public when it comes to injury. 'If compensation is due, compensation is due. By the same token, I expect a level of common sense and reason. 'There is absolutely an element of risk . in policing. The vast majority of officers will have had bumps, knocks, . scrapes and all kinds of injuries and it won't have crossed their minds . to claim. 'It is part of the rough and tumble of the job.' Most officers will seek advice from the Police Federation, which runs its own claim line for officers. Mr Blanchard said all cases are reviewed and evaluated by an independent solicitor to assess whether they will be successful. He said: 'The force's insurers are very thorough and don't pay out unless there is some fault there. 'We will have people come to us and, if we don't think they will be successful, we will give them a reality check. 'At the end of the day, it is our members' money and taxpayers' money that will be paid out.' Statistics: Humberside Police has received 44 compensation claims from staff between January 2010 and March this year - with 16 claims successful, 10 rejected and the rest ongoing . However, Mr Blanchard said such claims can improve safety for other officers. He continued: 'If officers have been injured, money doesn't make it all better. It is about providing some comfort, or . medical appliances that are needed, and it is also about demonstrating . to the force that the right health and safety measures were not in place . and they can correct them.' Malcolm Turner, deputy head of Nottinghamshire Police . legal services, said the force reviewed outstanding claims every month - . with checks made by the Deputy Chief Constable. He said: 'While some incidents may . apparently seem to be trivial, the consequences which might flow from . them can, on occasion, be very significant. 'Claims are handled in-house and all are . carefully scrutinised to ensure compensation is only paid in cases . where that is appropriate and the amounts paid are in line with the . guidance issued by the Judicial College.' The figures have been criticised by the Taxpayers' Alliance, which argued it included 'trivial claims', such as an officer receiving £1,200 for sprains after a strap broke on some portable equipment. Andrew Allison, spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance in East Yorkshire, said: 'There appears to be no doubt that the compensation culture in Britain is out of hand. 'Police officers should not be pursuing trivial claims such as when a strap breaks on equipment. 'Accidents like these happen every day. They should be leading by example and remember that taxpayers are picking up the bill.' The details of the compensation claims were revealed following a request by The Hull Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act. The response does not reveal whether the injuries were sustained while officers were responding to call-outs or whether they were on force property.","Nottinghamshire Police has paid out nearly £450k over the last five years .

For years council gardeners working on a smart suburban road have carefully trimmed back the grass verges during the summer months. But this year the authority have sent their workers out and told them to trim only one side of the street - and ignore the other because it is 'not their job any more'. In a baffling move designed to save money, two . local authorities in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, now have to send two separate gardeners to look after the same road. Council cutbacks: Bill Fenton, 65, said that while the authority has cut the grass on one side of this street in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, the other has been allowed to grow to 15 inches - because 'another authority is responsible' Edge of a council boundary: While Gedling Borough Council look after the far side of the road, the near side is classed as a 'public highway' so it is Nottinghamshire County Council's job to cut it . So while homeowners on one side have seen the unkempt grass grow to 15 inches, on the other it has been mowed four . times this year already and looks ‘like a billiards table’. Gedling Borough Council insist it is no longer their responsibility to keep the whole of Shelford Road looking smart - and blamed the decision on 'government cutbacks'. They trim the verges 14 times a year between March and October. Anger: Bill Fenton, 65, and his wife Sylvia, 66, who returned from six months away to find the grass overgrown . In comparison, Nottinghamshire County Council which has been handed the job of cutting the other side of the road, does the job only five times between April and November. It was thought that taking the job off Gedling Borough Council would help save taxpayers' money. Pensioners Bill and Sylvia Fenton . returned to Britain after six months away to find a 75-square metre . patch of grass outside their home was completely overgrown. Grandfather-of-two Bill, 65, said the situation has left their neighbourhood looking like an eyesore. 'Both sides were mowed in January but the changes must have occurred at . the start of the financial year,' he said. 'It hasn’t been cut since January now and has grown to 15 inches. The other side has probably been cut four times since January. 'It’s a small job that wouldn’t take . much effort, so I don’t know why they can’t just talk to each other and . arrange Gedling to do this extra patch. 'We all understand there’s austerity measures but to send two teams to do the same job on different days is ridiculous. 'It is a laughable situation. My grandson walked into it the other day and I nearly lost him. 'It feels like it’s not on the council’s list of things to do. We just don’t feel like we’re getting the service we pay for. 'One side looks like a billiard table and the other is a right eyesore. It’s ridiculous.' Cut price service: The move to have two authority's cutting two sides of the same road was made to 'save money' Overgrown: Nottinghamshire County Council insist they will be cutting the 15-inch grass imminently . A spokesman for Gedling Borough Council said: 'Both sides used of Shelford Road used to be our responsibility but when the Government cutbacks came in 2010, we stopped. 'One side is classed as a green space - which is our responsibility - but the other is a public highway, which is Nottinghamshire County Council's. So technically its not on our land.' Dave Walker, Nottinghamshire County Council’s district highways manager for Gedling, said there had been a delay in cutting their grass areas. He said: 'The county council is responsible for cutting more than 5,000kilometres of grass verge right across the county. 'There was a delay starting this year due to bad weather which, unfortunately, also helps the grass to grow that bit quicker. 'We are just coming to the end of the first cut so all areas, including Shelford Road, should have been cut by now.' Both councils said the grass is cut purely for safety, rather than aesthetic, reasons.","Gedling Council have only mowed one side of the road in Carlton, Notts .

Accused: Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins (pictured) denied raping a baby when he appeared via video link at Cardiff Crown Court today . Rock singer Ian Watkins appeared in court today to deny almost two dozen sex offence charges including two of raping a baby. The frontman for rock band Lostprophets appeared before Cardiff Crown Court, south Wales, in a plea hearing via video-link. Two women, aged 20 and 24, also denied sexual offences against children. Both appeared via video-link. Neither can be named for legal reasons. Watkins, 35, of Pontypridd, south Wales, denied 23 separate charges, among them for the first time two allegations he raped a baby, aged one at the time. One of the two women allegedly involved is accused of aiding and abetting him to carry it out. Watkins, whose band has sold more than 3.5 million albums worldwide, is also accused of aiding and abetting the sexual assault of a child. He also faces a series of charges for possessing, making and distributing indecent images of children. He is also accused of possessing extreme images depicting a person having sex with an animal. The oldest of the alleged offences dates back to 2007. The clerk in court today confirmed after the hearing that Watkins had pleaded not guilty to all charges. She confirmed that he appeared via video-link from where he is being held in custody at Parc Prison, Bridgend. She added that both he and the two women are collectively accused of a total of 32 offences. All three deny all the charges. Recorder of Cardiff judge Eleri Rees adjourned proceedings until Thursday for a case management hearing at the same court. Popular group: Watkins (left) formed Lostprophets (pictured) in 1997 with friends from the small former mining town of Pontypridd .

The American ‘Frankenstein Food’ giant Monsanto is giving up on a multi-million pound drive to force GM crops on to dinner tables in Britain and Europe. The company said the decision has been driven by the fact that the vast majority of farmers and consumers have no interest in growing or eating the crops. The move comes despite the fact the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has made it his business to back GM farming and food. Genetically modified: A test site for genetically modified winter oilseed rape crop in Essex . He has launched a series of initiatives designed to overturn public scepticism and to try and speed up the approval of new GM crops by the European Commission. Mr Paterson has suggested that the UK could go it alone and begin growing GM crops even if other EU member states maintain their own bans. However, Monsanto spokesman, Brandon Mitchner, said: ‘We are no longer working on lobbying for more cultivation in Europe. ‘Currently we do not plan to apply for the approval of new genetically modified crops. The reason is, among other things, low demand of the farmers.’ A farmer shows two corncobs of genetically engineered corn MON810 by Monsanto (right) and two normal corncobs on a field near the village of Badingen, Germany . This was confirmed by a spokesman for Monsanto Germany, Ursula Luttmer-Ouazane, who told the media there that the company recognises there is no demand. She said: ‘We've understood that such plants don't have any broad acceptance in European societies. It is counterproductive to fight against windmills.’ Other GM companies, such as Bayer CropScience, BASF and Syngenta, have also dramatically scaled back or dropped efforts to get their crops accepted in Europe. Successive British governments have bowed to pressure from US politicians and lobbied for the acceptance of GM crops in the EU, however other member states have remained opposed. Eight governments have banned cultivation of a Monsanto GM maize called MON 810, which is genetically modified to kill pests which feed on it, on the basis it might cause harm to other important insects. The ban on the maize and other forms of GM has been made under an EU environmental protection provision known as the ‘Safeguard Clause'. The eight are Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and most recently Poland, while Italy said it plans to follow suit. Even American consumers are now becoming increasingly concerned about the rise of biotech farming with pressure in many states for the labelling of food containing GM ingredients. While Monsanto and others may have given up on growing GM food in Europe, they continue to lobby for Britain and Europe to accept imports of the biotech crops for animal feed. A number of leading UK supermarkets recently announced they would allow GM feed to be given to chicken, pigs and cattle for the first time. Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op have joined other major names, including Morrisons and Asda in allowing GM soya and maize to be used as animal feed. The companies claimed they had no choice because it was becoming increasingly difficult to find non-GM soya from Brazil, the USA and other sources. This has been denied by suppliers in Brazil, while supermarkets in many other countries, including a number in Europe, say they will continue to source non-genetically modified crops for their farm animals. The UK stores will not label the meat, eggs and milk coming from these animals to identify their GM diet despite research saying this is what most shoppers want. Critics of the decision suggest the stores have effectively allowed GM firms to decide UK food policy rather than customers.","Monsanto gives up on multi-million pound genetically modified crop drive .

But the broadcaster's bosses did not take kindly when a colleague tried to treat legendary football commentator Brian Arrundale to a £36.65 bottle of champagne on his retirement. The corporation refused to sign off the expenses claim - which equated to little more than £1 for every year of work - made by senior broadcast journalist Paul Addison. Falling flat: The BBC has been accused of a lack of common sense after refusing to pay for a Champagne gift for retiring commentator Brian Arrundale, pictured front left celebrating with colleagues . The BBC's rather ungracious and mean-spirited treatment . has provoked a backlash from staff, with Mr Addison accusing senior . executives of a lack of common sense. He said: 'The end of the football season marked the end of an era for BBC Tees Sport. 'Our Hartlepool United commentator Brian Arrundale retired after 33 years of following the team, home and away. 'To mark the occasion - I wanted to . make him feel special - I bought a magnum of champagne (£36.65 - on . special offer - a third off at Sainsbury's) to present to him at the end . of an hour-long interview about his time with us. Thanks but no thanks: BBC bosses have come under fire for refusing to put on expenses a £36 bottle of Champagne to mark the retirement of a longstanding employee . 'As you can imagine, Brian was thrilled. 'I was rather less so when I came to . claim for the champers - it was refused on these grounds: '1.5.3 Gifts . for artists and contributors: If there is a valid business reason, gifts . such as flowers (but not champagne) may be given to talent and the cost . must be reclaimed through expenses.' 'So I couldn't reward a valued . contributor with a bottle of fizz that equated to approximately £1 for . every year of his service to the BBC. 'Can we not apply some common sense to the policy? 'I understand why we can't be seen to . be spending vast amounts on champagne (although flowers appear to be . fair game) but £36.65 doesn't seem too extreme.' The BBC decided to implement a ban on champagne after provoking a storm of criticism when it emerged that between 2007 and 2011 it splashed out on 9,000 bottles of champers, spending a total of £103,667 on bubbly. The vast sums included £200 on a bottle of Krug Vintage and more than £1,000 on 11 bottles of Dom Perignon. During a five-year period, the BBC got through an average of 690 bottles of wine, 150 bottles of champagne or sparkling wine and 1,417 bottles or cans of beer or cider every month . On one occasion, BBC staff splashed out £200 on a single bottle of premium champagne: Krug Vintage 1995 . It imposed a blanket ban on staff buying champers in 2012 - with none at all claimed on expenses by staff last year. Banned: The BBC banned Champagne after it emerged the corporation spent £103,667 on the drink in a few years . Mr Arrundale retired in April this year after commentating for BBC Tees on every Hartlepool United game - home and away - for the past 33 years. The commentator had devoted his working life to the Beeb covering matches for the League Two team since 1980. Mr Arrundale was honoured by the club when he retired earlier this year by former Hartlepool midfielder Brian Honour, who played for Hartlepool 393 times between 1995 and 2005. Mr Honour said in April this year: 'He's wonderful fella and he's got a real love for Pools. 'It's sad that he'll no longer be commentating on the games on the radio but you can bet he'll be keeping a keen interest in the club so it's great that they've given him a Season Ticket. 'He's become part of the fixtures and fittings at The Vic so it will be strange not seeing him in the press box or hearing him on the radio but I wish him all the best in his retirement.' A BBC source said today: 'The ban on champagne was imposed after 9,000 odd bottles were bought in five years, but that was mainly for lovvies and big bosses trading bottles with each other. 'This guy has been working here for more than 30 years and deserves something for his devotion. OK, he got the champagne, but the poor sod who bought him it is out of pocket.' A BBC spokesman said: 'In the interests of delivering value for money for the licence fee payer we do not buy champagne for departing contributors or staff.

It was then that he discovered she had begun a relationship with Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster in Coronation Street. Le Vell has been written out of the soap pending the outcome of his child sex trial. Mr Fouche last night told how he had . started divorce proceedings against his estranged wife, citing . 'irreconcilable differences'. The couple, who met on Facebook, have been married since 2009 and have three-year-old and a two-year-old together. 'This has been very hard for me to . bear,' he told the Star. 'My wife has left me and taken my kids halfway . across the world, and is now with a guy facing very serious . allegations.' It is just over a fortnight since Le . Vell appeared in court under his real name, Michael Turner, to deny a . string of child sex offences. The star answered 'not guilty' to each . of the individual charges as they were put to him by the clerk during . the brief hearing at Manchester Crown Court. The alleged offences relate to one complainant and all took place between 2001 and 2010. Michael Le Vell leaves Manchester Crown Court, where he is denied 19 sex charges, including six counts of raping a child, six allegations of indecently assaulting a child and seven counts of sexual activity with a child . Mrs Fouche, who is originally from . Chile, reportedly met the father of two, who divorced his wife Janette . last year, while staying with a friend who lives near him in Hale, an . upmarket suburb of Manchester. It emerged on Tuesday that she had . been forced to close her Facebook account after suffering online abuse . from relatives of her husband after news of her relationship with the . actor broke. She said of her relationship with the soap star: ‘I’ve liked him from a distance for a long time. ‘I’ve been seeing him for a few weeks. I always go to his place and I’ve been to the pub with him. ‘We’ve held hands and walked down the . street, we’ve been careful, but we’ve not been hiding. It’s just that . there’s been no photographers here. I don’t want to say  anything that . might upset him. He’s told me not to say anything.’ Mrs Fouche added: ‘I go to his house . or we meet up in The Railway. He has a lot of friends. He’s a lucky man. I don’t want to say anything that will upset Michael.’ The actor declined to discuss their relationship, saying: ‘She’s a neighbour and a friend. That’s all I’m going to say.’ 'I’ve liked him from a distance for a long time': Mrs Fouche, left, met father of two Le Vell, who divorced his wife Janette last year, while staying with a friend who lives near him in Hale, an upmarket suburb of Manchester .

The IT expert explained that he was . having difficulty finding work had been hoping to join her and search . for a job in the UK. 'I am just hoping that Blanca . will begin to see sense so we can sort out some proper access,' he said. 'It has been torture not to see my sons.'

Police hunting a wanted criminal burst into the wrong flat and accused the innocent owner of hiding drugs inside his dead father's urn. Nine officers raided Barry Cleaver's home and turned it upside down after a tip-off about the hiding place of a fugitive. Mr Cleaver watched in horror as one of them picked up the small urn containing his dad's ashes, shook it and demanded to know if it contained drugs. When Mr Cleaver, whose dad Barry Cleaver Snr died in 2008, told him what was inside the shocked policeman gently replaced the six-inch purple pot. He said: 'The copper held the remains of my dad and shook it. 'He asked me what was inside, then asked if it was full of drugs. 'The top comes off, so he could have had a look for himself, but he didn't. 'He got the shock of his life when I told him what it was - he carefully put it down and then all the police left.' Mr . Cleaver, 40, has now lodged a complaint with the Independent Police . Complaints Commission following the bungled raid in Salford, Greater . Manchester, by the Serious Organised Crime Unit of Greater Manchester . Police. They were supposed to be raiding a flat in a nearby building. Mr Cleaver had been unable to answer the door when the search team knocked because he was in bed suffering from a slipped disc. Apology: Barry Cleaver Snr, pictured left, died in 2008. His son keeps his ashes in an urn (right) at his home . The police entered by picking the lock and were subsequently charged £193.20 for a locksmith to replace it. Mr . Cleaver added: 'They paid for the door to be fixed but I'm disgusted at . the way they treated me. 'I'm not after money, I'd just like an . apology. 'How dare they burst into my house and treat me like a criminal? 'I told them numerous times that they had the wrong guy and each time they ignored me. 'I dread to think what could have happened if they had dropped my father's urn.' According to police, the raid was part of an investigation into a cash in transit robbery that happened earlier that day in nearby Prestwich. A police spokesperson said: 'On arrival, police knocked on the door of the property. As there was no response from inside, officers forced entry causing some damage to the lock. 'On this occasion entry was forced to allow evidence to be recovered quickly to aid the ongoing investigation. Mr Cleaver watched as one of the officers picked up the urn containing his dad's ashes . 'In this case, a false address was given by someone who was currently in custody being questioned by police and the door has now been repaired.' Detective Inspector Clare Devlin from the Salford Division, said: 'While we understand why this man may feel aggrieved, officers have since been to see him and expressed our regret at what happened. 'However, we acted with the best of intentions. Police officers are given powers of forced entry for a variety of reasons. 'These include searching properties to secure evidence and arresting suspected offenders. 'On this occasion, the information that we were given meant that we felt the best thing to do was force entry once the door was not answered. 'Every time a forced entry is made, police officers will try to minimise damage where possible but the most important aspect of any forced entry is to safely secure evidence and arrest those suspected of being involved in a crime. 'On very rare occasions, like this one, there may be instances where the wrong address is searched due to false information provided to police. 'When such rare instances do occur and entry is forced to the wrong address, the Force will issue an apology to the homeowner and pay for repairs. 'There are also a range of options open to complainants who can either seek civil redress or make a formal complaint to our Professional Standards Department.'","Nine officers stormed Barry Cleaver's home in Salford, Greater Manchester .

Three female healthcare assistants 'beat two elderly patients and mistreated nine others' on a hospital ward, a court heard today. Akousa Sakyiwaa, 38, Annette Jackson, 33, and Sharmila Gunda, 36, are charged with several counts of ill-treatment or neglect under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, with Ms Sakyiwaa and Ms Gunda also charged with assault by beating. The incidents are alleged to have taken place from February 27 to April 30 last year on Beech Ward at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London. Akousa Sakyiwaa, 38, (left) and Sharmila Gunda, 36, (right) are charged with several counts of ill-treatment or neglect under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 . Ms Sakyiwaa, of Leytonstone, is charged with seven counts of ill-treatment or neglect and one count of assault by beating. Ms Jackson, of Hounslow, is charged with five counts of ill-treatment or neglect. Ms Gunda, of Ilford, is charged with two counts of ill-treatment or neglect and one charge of assault by beating. They deny all the charges. Annette Jackson, 33, also faces several charges of neglect . Sakyiwaa and Gunda accused of beating elderly Winifred Dempsey and June Evans. Mrs Evans, who is wheelchair bound, is the only patient still alive or well enough to come to court to give evidence against them. The other patients are too ill or suffer from dementia. Jurors heard the healthcare assistants were arrested after q student nurse Lucy Brown whistleblew on them following a placement on the ward last Spring. John McNally, prosecuting, said: 'The conduct complained of simply had no place on any ward. It cannot be justified.' Snaresbrook Crown Court heard 92-year-old Lily Oliver was admitted to the ward on March 27, 2012, suffering from septic arthritis in her left knee. Mr McNally told jurors: 'She was bed bound and extremely frail and it is the expert’s professional opinion that she suffered from dementia and wasn’t able to make her own decisions. 'During the time she was on Beech Ward she was under the care of Akousa Sakyiwaa. 'Lucy Brown described Akousa Sakyiwaa as being extremely rough with Lily Oliver. 'In the course of one encounter Lucy Brown noted that when Miss Oliver’s bandages were removed Miss Oliver said ‘mind my leg.’ After that Akousa Sakyiwaa grabbed her left knee with both her hands and pushed it towards Lucy Brown. 'This caused her to scream in pain and turn pale before falling silent. That, we say, is what constitutes ill treatment for that count.' The incidents are alleged to have taken place from February 27 to April 30 last year on Beech Ward at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London . John McNally, prosecuting, told the jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court that the three women were responsible for looking after elderly female patients with various physical and mental conditions including dementia . Jurors have yet to hear about the . mistreatment to the other patients who the court heard were all female, . elderly and suffering from various physical and mental conditions . including dementia. Opening the case, Mr McNally said: “This case is about certain patients in the care of these defendants. 'The prosecution case is they . variously ill treated patients either by positive actions towards them . or by failing to look after them when they should have. 'The defendants worked on a geriatric ward and were trusted to provide the most basic tasks.'There is little doubt some of these would have been unpleasant and that elderly and demented patients could be obstructive. 'However, this factor only serves to . highlight the vulnerability of these patients and outline the fact that . providing care professionally was the responsibility of each defendant.'An entitlement for proper care should not be a matter of chance given at the whim of the carer.'

Letting churchgoers park free of charge in town centre car parks on Sundays discriminates against non-believers, a secular campaigner claims. Keith Porteous Wood is suing a local council over the scheme, which applies to individuals of all faiths. Mr Porteous Wood, of the National Secular Society, argues that by allowing free parking for those attending churches in Woking, Surrey, the local council is contravening the Equality Act. Discrimination claim: Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the National Secular Society says it is unfair that churchgoers get free parking permits in Woking, Surrey, while he still had to pay £3 . Free parking pass: One of the permits issued to worshippers in Woking by churchers, with the backing of the council . ‘The equal treatment of all, . regardless of belief or non-belief, is a key secular principle,’ he . said. ‘It is neither legitimate nor lawful for local government to . subsidise the activities of any particular religion and belief group. 'It . would be fairer if the council either charged worshippers for parking . or provided free parking for all.’ After receiving a number of . complaints from local residents, Mr Porteous Wood drove to Woking on . Sunday April 14 and paid £3 to park in the Heathside Crescent council . town centre car park for more than two hours. Those at church services . parked in the same car park for free. Mr Porteous Wood’s ‘less favourable . treatment’ was because of religious belief, his lawyers argue in what . will be a test case for local authorities all over the country. Unholy row: Woking Borough Council's lawyers advised that the free permits could be justified . Free parking: Woking United Reformed Church has been issuing free parking passes to worshippers to use on a Sunday morning . They point out that local churches have been provided with ticket validating machines or parking permits. Woking Borough Council confirmed it had received the notice of legal action from NSS’s lawyers. Council official Peter Bryant . defended the free parking, saying that faith communities play an . important role in voluntary work and promoting social inclusion. He added: ‘The council took legal . advice. It was advised that it amounted to indirect discrimination, but . could be justified on the basis that it was a proportionate means of . achieving a legitimate aim.’ Woking United Reform Church gives out council-backed parking permits to churchgoers valid between 9.30am and 1pm on Sundays. The issue of free parking for worshippers has become increasingly contentious as more councils scrap free Sunday parking to pursue extra revenue. The charges were initially denounced as a 'tax on worshippers' and a number of local authorities set up 'worship parking permit' schemes. Row: Woking United Reform Church, in Woking, Surrey, issue the free parking passes in a scheme backed by the council . However, there are mixed feelings about the case in Woking. Office worker Karen Vincent, 44, said: ‘I am not a churchgoer myself but I think that it is very sad that the Secular Society feels it is necessary to take this costly action. ‘No doubt the council will incur a large legal bill defending its decision. I am sure that as well as the churches, the council helps other organisations with subsidised parking.’ But businessman Mark Robertson, 57, supports the challenge. He said: ‘If you are going to give one group of people free parking then you need to give it to them all. ‘This is completely unfair. Why should I be discriminated against because I am an atheist?’","Churchgoers are allowed to park in Woking, Surrey, for free on Sundays .

After 90 tons of manure and two years of round-the-clock care, Britain's most expensive pineapple is almost ready to eat. Ripening in the greenhouse at the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall, the record-breaking fruit was grown using Victorian cultivation methods and is worth an estimated £10,000. But if the Heligan pineapple sounds pricey, then spare a thought for the Japanese buyer who splashed out 1.6 million yen (£10,300) for just two melons. Expensive: Canteloupe, or Yubari, melons like the ones sold last week are a status symbol in Japan . The record-breaking Yubari, or canteloupe, melons were sold during an auction at Sapporo Central Wholesale Market in northern Hokkaido last Friday. The eye-watering price is the third highest ever paid for the fruit, with the most expensive pair selling for 2.5 million yen (£16,300) in 2008. Although few command the price of a Yubari melon, Japan is one of the most expensive places in the world for fruit and vegetables. A single apple typically retails for around £3.30 while the average price of a presentation pack of 20 cherries is a whopping £65.50. Pricey: The Lost Gardens of Heligan's pineapple (left) and the world's most expensive fungi, truffles (right) Three: The number of trips to Falmouth needed to collect 90 tonnes of manure . Four: Number of people required to tend the pineapples and replace the old manure . One: The number of painters needed to keep the glasshouse in pineapple-worthy condition . But despite the high prices commanded by canteloupe melons, a status symbol in the Far East, there are some fruit and vegetables that cost even more. Truffles regularly fetch more than £196,000 per pound at auction, while saffron sells for an average of £3,200. A single pound of saffron contains more than 225,000 stigmas from 75,000 crocus plants, while truffles are both rare and difficult to dig up. Other painfully expensive varieties of fruit and vegetable include Ruby Roman grapes, which can sell for as much as £4,100 per pound at auction, which works out as roughly £170 per grape. Similarly expensive are La Bonnotte potatoes, which are grown exclusively on the island of Noirmoutier, just off the French Atlantic coast. Only 100 tonnes of La Bonnotte potatoes are grown each year, and they sell for a wallet-busting £210 for a single pound.","A Japanese buyer splashed out £10,300 on a pair of melons last Friday .

Went bankrupt: Inventor Peter Williams jumped in front of a train after being pursued for council tax arrears by his local authority, an inquest heard . A renowned inventor threw himself in front of a train on the day he was due to be evicted from his house because of unpaid council tax. Engineer Peter Williams, 63, who invented the world’s most efficient hand dryer, was being pursued for 20 years of tax arrears and killed himself months before his invention received international recognition. He initially owed £1,350 but by the time he was killed by a train at Biggleswade in February last year, the sum had risen to £70,000, including legal fees. The court previously heard claims the council had ‘hounded him death’ but yesterday officials said they had ‘spent years’ trying to help him. The engineer left notes for friends and family telling them he had ‘had enough’ and could not face losing his four-bedroom £200,000 home. Yesterday Bedford Coroner’s Court heard how Mr Williams, from Langford, Bedfordshire, fell ill with diabetes in 1993 and had become unable to work. He was declared bankrupt in February 2007 and his finances were put in the hands of trustees. He failed to pay his council tax for ten years and ran up the arrears and legal debts. Mr Williams invented the Vortex hand dryer but was working for the company developing it unpaid and it was not until after his death that it was named the world’s most efficient hand dryer by the Guinness Book of Records. Deputy coroner Martin Oldham was read a statement from a former employee of Central Bedfordshire Council who had been dealing with Mr Williams over non-payment of his council tax since the mid-1990s. James Tomlin said he was told by a GP in 2010 that ‘Mr Williams was suffering from depression and the council’s actions were not helping’. Alarm: Police officer found two notes at Mr Willliams's house (above) which indicated that the bachelor, who suffered from mental problems and was diabetic, was going to take his life . But Mr Tomlin said he had met Mr . Williams at his home to deliver paperwork and discuss his situation and . had no concerns about his mental health. 'Brilliant man': At the time he killed himself, Mr Williams owed £70,000 . Mr Williams informed the council that . he had diabetes and subsequent ill health but failed to fill in any . forms to see if he was eligible to claim council tax benefit, single . person’s allowance, or disability or unemployment benefits, the inquest . heard. He also did not attend court hearings . that were to deal with his council tax debt, nor did he respond often . to communication relating to bankruptcy petitions or his eviction. Over the years Mr Williams made . sporadic payments towards his debt but it was never enough to . significantly reduce the amount he owed. Council chief executive Richard Carr . said the council had a legal obligation to make sure tax was paid and . that bankruptcy procedures were ‘very much a last resort’. He added: ‘I do not think it was the . case that the system failed, I think every reasonable effort was made to . enable Mr Williams to apply for the assistance he was eligible for. ‘The onus is on Mr Williams to . demonstrate that he does not have the ability to pay. 'The council made a . concerted effort to receive from him details of those financial affairs . and he declined to provide that information.’ The inquest continues. Peter Williams invented the technology behind the Vortex hand dryer, named the world's most efficient by the Guinness Book of Records . The Vortex hand dryer created using Peter Williams' technology holds the world record for being the most efficient hand dryer. It beat off competition to win the title by drying four pairs of wet hands using just 30KJ of energy. The dryer, which retails at around £300 a unit, is designed to save business owners money in the long term as it uses only 550W of power - a fraction of that used by traditional dryers. Although a relatively new product, the Vortex EcoSmart dryer has already been installed by a number of UK businesses, including branches of McDonald's, Hastings Hotels and the University of East Anglia. It is being marketed by SAVortex, a company owned by Syed Ahmed and set up with £20,000 of his money. The dryer uses unique 'brushless bypass motor technology' which compresses and recycles heat. Traditional dryers use carbon brushes or heat elements which use a lot of power. The company behind the dryer says its product is also better than the modern 'hand-in' dryers as it does not cause water to collect in the bottom - a common cause of bacteria.","Peter Williams, 63, owed £70,000 and was bankrupt at time of his death .

The University of Cambridge has defended a law exam described as 'horrific' by students because of its graphic depictions of oral sex, male rape and naked torture. The university's renowned law faculty has used real-life scenarios for exams in the past, but many students were left shocked by its latest test questions. Around 200 students sitting the exam on Saturday morning were presented with a scenario involving a fictional college drinking society's initiation ceremony which went on to describe several indecent assaults. Test: Around 200 students at the University of Cambridge, pictured, sat a law exam on Saturday which contained graphic depictions of oral sex, male rape and torture . The question in the three-hour exam at the university's Faculty of Law began: 'Sandra is President of The Vizards, a College drinking society. She is organising the initiation of new members. 'After a great deal of alcohol has been drunk, the members of the society form a circle around Billy, Gilbert and Richard who are to be initiated.' The question then described three rituals in which a male student was blindfolded and given oral sex by another man, another was sexually assaulted with a bottle and a third had his pubic hair shaved off before dying from a subsequent infection. The students were asked to outline any offences which may have been committed during the scenario. After the exam students took to social networking sites with one describing it as 'horrific' and 'beyond acceptable'. @mirandajulietp tweeted: 'That's a horrific question - so far beyond acceptable and a total misrepresentation of most socs, actually'.

Sebastian Salek, a third year law . student at Clare College, told the website: 'It was surprising to see the university . directly reference drinking societies and particularly initiations, . which they generally tend to turn a blind eye to.' But The Tab added that other students felt that the question demonstrated that the university is keeping up with the times, with one fresher from Trinity quoted as saying: 'Drinking socs are, after all, a big part of life at Cambridge.' Luke Martin-Fuller, who sat the exam, told the Daily Telegraph that no-one in the examination hall had reacted when they first read the paper. He said: 'Nobody batted an eyelid, nobody sniggered or looked up or glanced at anyone – you just got on with it. 'I can see why it might look a bit funny. I can understand why people might think that's a bit risqué.' The Faculty of Law has previously used graphic scenarios in its papers with one exam, which was posted online last year,  presenting a similar question about a . drinking society initiation ceremony which involved running naked through .

A University of Cambridge spokesman confirmed the incident, saying: 'In the Part One Criminal Law examination paper set by the University of Cambridge Law Faculty, hypothetical situations are presented in order to test students' understanding of different aspects of Criminal Law.'","Around 200 students sat the three-hour-long exam on Saturday morning .

A Chinese city plans to fine mothers who have a child out of wedlock, sparking criticism that the policy is discriminatory and could lead to an increase in abandoned babies. Wuhan city says the rule is aimed at keeping the birth rate low. One expert says it is the first time that out-of-wedlock children have been expressly singled out for penalty by one of China's municipalities, which have flexibility in how they enforce national population-control policies. Wuhan city's policy to fine single mothers follows the rescue of Baby 59, whose mother took days to come forward after he slipped down a sewer pipe . It comes days after the rescue of a young single mother's newborn from a sewer pipe in eastern China prompted discussion over the stigma that single mothers face. 'If the policy is approved, there could be more ""sewer babies"" because when mothers can't afford the cost, they might think about throwing their babies away,' said Chen Yaya, a gender equality researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. On Friday, the government of the city, in central Hubei, published online a draft updated family planning policy which it says is aimed at keeping the city's birth rate at a low level. The policy says that 'the parties' should pay the fee in cases of births that are out of wedlock or when one side knowingly has a child with someone who has a spouse. It has been interpreted in state media as mainly targeting unmarried mothers and women who have affairs with married men. The public has a week to comment on it. 'It looks like the policy is targeted just at women from my understanding,' Chen said. She said unmarried mothers already faced discrimination, including being barred from receiving maternity benefits from the government. Unmarried mothers also face stigma because premarital sex traditionally has been frowned upon. In the case of the baby found in the sewer in Zhejiang province on May 25, his mother told police she got pregnant after a brief affair, could not afford an abortion, hid her pregnancy from family and neighbours and had concerns about whether she would be able to raise the child. Police also said she told them the baby slipped into the sewer accidentally shortly after its birth, an account they later said they accepted. Wuhan's proposed rule would be the first time that bearing a child when unmarried has been spelled out as a separate offence, said Yuan Xin, a professor of population studies at Renmin University. Gender equality researcher Chen Yaya said the policy could produce more 'sewer babies' if mothers cannot afford the cost of the fine . 'In fact, a lot of family planning regulations have included unmarried childbearing under illegal childbearing. They were just not specified as a separate term as is the case this time with Wuhan,' he said. 'We need to distinguish between the legal and moral aspects and define what a family is nowadays, said Yuan. 'Let's say I am single, and I want to have a child. Is that wrong? No, it's not, so is it considered a family? 'Having a baby with a married man, is that considered a family? All these details need to be specified.' Babies resulting from an unmarried relationship or an affair with someone who is already married will provoke a 'social compensation fee', an official at the family planning committee of Wuhan said. Social compensation fees are levied on people who break China's strict family planning policy, which restricts many urban couples to one child. The fee depends on the province and the whim of the local family planning bureau, and the children are denied education and health benefits. Hubei province sets its social compensation fee at three times average annual disposable income.","Wuhan city says the fine and rule is aimed at keeping the birth rate low .

Banks have cut the amount of money they have made available for loans despite taking billions from the government which was supposed to trigger a boom in lending. Total lending by banks and building societies fell by £300million in the first three months of 2013, leaving struggling small businesses ‘out in the cold’. However some of the biggest names on the high street have received billions of pounds from George Osborne’s Funding for Lending scheme, including the banks owned by the taxpayer. Net lending from some of Britain's biggest banks fell in the first three months of 2013, new figures show . New figures from the Bank of England reveal the slump in lending, renewing fears that the economy will struggle to grow if businesses are unable to access cheap and easy credit. Lloyds Banking Group – 39 per cent owned by the British taxpayer - lent almost £1 billion less from January to March, despite taking £3 billion from the Bank of England and Treasury scheme. A spokesman for Llyods said: 'The acid test for the Funding for Lending Scheme's success is whether we are lending to SMEs and First Time Buyers. 'We have been growing our SME lending by 4% a year, on a net basis, and we have also pledged to increase our new lending to first time buyers to £6.5bn in 2013 compared to £6bn last year. 'But as part of our effort to focus on these fundamental parts of the economy we are running down certain ‘non-core’ parts of our business. 'The decline in our overall lending in the first three months of 2013 as reported in the latest Bank of England figures, is entirely the result of this shift in focus and the figures show a reducing rate of decline, which demonstrates the progress we are making towards achieving overall growth in our lending this year.' Taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland also shrunk its net lending by £1.6 billion in the quarter, but has borrowed £750 million from the Funding for Lending scheme. The Bank of England said lending to homeowners has been positive but continues to fall to business. It added it will ‘take time’ for the scheme to feed through to bigger lending volumes. The Funding for Lending scheme has so far given £16.5billion to 40 participating lenders. But their lending has shrunk by a net £1.8 billion since the scheme was launched in August. Write caption here . Paul Fisher, executive director for markets at the Bank, said the net lending fall was ‘broadly as expected’. He added: ‘The plans of the FLS participants suggest that net lending volumes will pick up gradually through the remainder of 2013.’ There had been an increase in mortgage lending homebuyers but credit to businesses has ‘mostly been negative’. Spanish-owned bank Santander cut its net lending by £2.3 billion as it continued its retreat from riskier parts of the mortgage market. The FLS was recently beefed up to extend more loans to credit-starved small businesses after criticism over its impact. The scheme offers lenders discounted loans in return for boosting the flow of credit to the economy. The pace of lending decline slowed from a net £2.4 billion decrease in the final three months of 2012, and the Bank said net lending should pick up and turn ‘modestly positive’ over the rest of the year. Since last August banks have received billions of pounds from George Osborne's Funding for Lending scheme . Barclays, which has borrowed £6 billion from the FLS, increased its lending by £1.1 billion during the quarter. Nationwide Building Society also hiked its lending by £1.2 billion after drawing £2.5 billion from the scheme. There were also major credit injections from firms including Tesco Bank, Virgin Money and Coventry Building Society. But the scheme was criticised for failing to boost credit to businesses. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ‘The real test for Funding for Lending is whether it is able to get credit flowing to young and fast-growing businesses. ‘Unfortunately many of these growth firms are still being left out in the cold when it comes to accessing finance, which prevents them from expanding, creating jobs and helping to drive a business-led recovery.’ TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ‘The Funding for Lending scheme is not providing the support small businesses need in these tough economic times. ‘It seems that some banks are just using the Funding for Lending to improve their capital position. ‘This is why we need a properly resourced state investment bank that can provide the assistance firms need to grow and create jobs.’","Businesses find it harder to get credit despite George Osborne's flagship scheme to increase lending .

Religious role: The Queen, pictured on the 60th anniversary of her coronation, has to uphold the 'laws of God' Legalising gay marriage could force the Queen to break a Coronation oath, a senior clergyman warned yesterday. Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said the Queen vowed when she was crowned 60 years ago to ‘uphold the laws of God’. He claimed that signing into law an act allowing same-sex couples to marry would contravene that promise. He spoke as opponents of same-sex unions launched a last-ditch bid to kill the plans in the House of Lords today. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will demand amendments to the Bill to protect those with moral objections. Gay marriage passed with a large majority in the Commons and polls show most of the public are in favour, but it will face a tougher ride in the traditionalist Lords. Bishop Nazir-Ali made his comments in a service outside Buckingham Palace on the 60th anniversary of the Coronation. He later told the Mail: ‘The idea of a  constitutional monarchy comes from the Bible. Christians are told in the Bible to obey their rulers, unless the ruler tells us to do something God forbids. ‘Happily in this country we have a monarchy that has taken an oath of upholding God’s laws, and the present Queen has for years been faithful to that. We are praying that she continues to be faithful. But while she is faithful to the vows she has taken, in this country she has to act on the advice of her ministers. Debate: Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, with the Queen, says that the gay marriage law is at odds with 'the settlement of the Church of England' ‘That puts the onus on the Prime Minister not to put the Queen into a position where she may have to go against the sovereign promises she has made. We hope that she is not put in that position.’ He said legalising gay marriage could  put the Queen at odds with the ‘law of God and the settlement of the Church of England’, adding: ‘Ministers should not be putting her in a position contrary to what she has promised.’ Peers will discuss the controversial legislation today and tomorrow, after it passed in the Commons last month backed by the overwhelming majority of MPs. It is set to meet opposition in the House of Lords, which has an older membership and seats for Church of England bishops. More than 85 have asked to speak in the debate, forcing the Government to carry over the vote to a second day. Archbishop Welby is expected to call for amendments so faith schools and teachers who do not wish to ‘promote’ gay marriage in class will not be penalised. He will ask for changes to ensure opponents are not prosecuted under equality laws for expressing their views and to stop registrars being sacked if they refuse to carry out same-sex unions. Contentious: Peers will discuss the controversial same-sex marriage legislation, after it passed in the Commons last month . Polls have repeatedly shown the majority of the public are in favour of the Bill. But Conservative Grassroots, a group of rank and file party members, has written to a national paper calling on peers to ‘defend our freedoms’ by voting against. The letter from chairman Bob Woollard says David Cameron’s focus on gay marriage is ‘alienating’ Tory supporters. ‘The golden inheritance of every previous generation, that has been lovingly handed down to us, is being smashed on the anvil of “equality and fairness”,’ he writes. Yesterday, former Tory chairman Lord Mawhinney said a ‘large majority’ of party members are opposed to gay marriage. He told Sky News: ‘Most people who have been party members for some time are adamantly opposed to it and indeed a number of them are demonstrating their opposition by simply leaving the party.’","Bishop Nazir-Ali says Queen cannot sign legislation as upholder of church .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 11:03 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:19 EST, 3 June 2013 . Scotland Yard is reviewing proposed changes to the law which would increase the number of ethnic minority officers joining the police force. Under the proposals, which Scotland Yard is discussing with the government, the Met would have to recruit an ethnic minority officer for every white constable they hire. Met chiefs believe the move is necessary to make the police force, which is currently a 'white, male-dominated' organisation, more representative of the community it serves. Proposed positive discrimination: Scotland Yard is in discussion with the government over proposed changes to the law which could help increase the number of ethnic minorities on the Met police force . Just 10 per cent of the Met’s 32,000 officers are from ethnic minority backgrounds compared to 40 per cent of London’s overall population. Scotland Yard is now considering a system similar to that used in Northern Ireland where one Catholic officer was recruited for every Protestant officer to bring proportional representation to the force. A Met spokesman said: 'The MPS is considering a range of positive action options as permitted under the Equality Act to help attract applications in our forthcoming recruitment process for approximately 5,000 new officers, which will enable our workforce to be more representative of the communities it serves. 'We know from the 2011 census that London is more diverse than ever and that our workforce does not reflect that diversity as we would like it to, despite significant progress in recent years. Time for change: Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne said the Met Police Service needs to overcome its history of being a white, male-dominated organisation . 'Options under consideration include . access to coaching by established officers, the provisions of additional . training prior to candidates attending assessment centres, changes to . the application and selection processes and bursaries for CKP students. 'No final decisions on these options have been yet been taken.' Other police forces and organisations have used positive discrimination to make their membership more representative of the wider community. The 50-50 recruitment rule for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is one of the best known examples of positive discrimination. From 2001, the force was legally obliged to operate a policy of recruiting a Catholic officer for every Protestant it employed in order to address the under-representation of the Catholic/Nationalist community that had existed for many decades in policing. Before the rule was introduced, the former Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was made up of 92 per cent from the Protestant/Unionist community. By February 2011, 29.7 per cent of the 7,200 officers were from the Catholic community and the scheme was ended in March that year. In South Africa, a 'quota system' was enforced in 1998 which meant the country's cricket team had to include a minimum of four players from ethnic backgrounds in their starting eleven for each match. The country announced plans last year to scrap the scheme in favour of a new system which would monitor 'transformation targets' of all sports instead of enforcing them. Although the spokesman added that, despite the 50-50 law change being openly discussed by police chiefs, it was not part of the force's current proposals. They continued: 'This would require a change in the law and whilst it has been quite openly discussed by the MPS, as well other forces, it is recognised that the context is very different and it is not within our current proposals. 'Nevertheless we continue to explore how we target groups in our recruitment processes to bring different skills and knowledge to the police service.' The comments come after Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne, who is in charge of Territorial Policing, said the current race relations law doesn’t allow the force 'to be as bold as we could be' ahead of a huge public recruitment campaign for 5,000 officers over the next three to four years. In an interview with the Guardian, he said: 'We have not kept pace with the changing shape of London ... The thing we have got to overcome, by legacy and history, we have broadly been, initially, a white, male-dominated organisation.' Byrne revealed the Met is also considering outsourcing its recruitment in an attempt to prevent the issue from continuing. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester police, added: 'The police service is not as effective as it could be in countering terrorism because of its ethnic makeup. 'A big part of dealing with terrorism and crime is gathering intelligence, having people who get to know local people so they have the confidence to pass information.' The Met Police Federation said it was opposed to positive discrimination with its Chairman John Tully stating: 'Any discrimination is wrong, appointment should only be based on merit.'","Just 10% of Met's officers are from ethnic minorities .

Comedian Bob Mills last night said BBC producers had ‘overstepped the mark’ for asking him on a live radio programme how lesbian presenter Clare Balding could be ‘turned around’. He blamed the production team for specifically giving him the ‘galling question’ in which he responded that women could be ‘cured’ of homosexuality. Dozens of listeners have complained to the Corporation about the comments accusing producers of promoting homophobic bullying. The BBC issued a second apology yesterday admitting it had ‘got it wrong’ before taking down the offending material from its internet iPlayer service. The media regulator Ofcom said it will now assess complaints before investigating whether the programme breached ‘generally accepted standards’. The offensive comments were made during Radio 5Live’s quiz show Fighting Talk, broadcast half an hour before the 9pm watershed on Saturday. Host Colin Murray asked contestants, during a section called ‘Defend the Indefensible’, to argue: ‘Give me 20 minutes with her and I’m pretty sure I could turn around Clare Balding’. Mr Mills then stated that the former jockey and racing presenter was a ‘horse woman’ who ‘appreciates power between her thighs’. He added: ‘And we all know, there is no woman that can’t be cured’. His response was met by loud groans from the large audience that was watching the show at the Liverpool Echo Arena as part of the station’s Big Day Out event. Mr Mills yesterday said he ‘regretted’ the comments and felt under pressure to answer the question in 20 seconds in front of a crowd of thousands.

THE BBC is under fire for refusing to buy a retiring sports commentator a £36 bottle of bubbly because of a ban on the drink. After facing a storm over the amount it was spending on champagne – £100,000 between 2007 and 2011 – the corporation stopped buying it and imposed a ban in 2012. But this week the broadcaster was accused of taking the cutback too far when bosses refused to fund a  bottle bought for staff  member Brian Arrundale, who had commentated on  Hartlepool United matches for BBC Tees for 33 years. ‘I think they have overstepped the mark and maybe this will stop it happening in the future. 'I don’t know why Clare Balding was chosen for the question but she had been on the show and knows the team.’ During a later episode of the same show broadcast at 11pm, Murray asked another tawdry question involving Miss Balding.

Ofcom - which received 52 complaints about the incident - said it considered the term to be an example of 'offensive language' in the context of the show. The body said a number of viewers considered it to have simply been used as a substitute for a swear word and 'as a result it was capable of causing a certain amount of offence'. Ofcom said the use of 'effing' went beyond audience expectations for the show - which started at 8pm - and was not appropriate for a pre-watershed show which appealed to children.","Star Bob Mills blamed production team for asking him question on air .

Police are targeting ‘khat’  houses in Woolwich amid fears they are recruiting grounds for Islamic extremists. Khat is a leafy stimulant grown in East Africa that delivers an amphetamine-like high for as long as it is chewed. One of the two Woolwich suspects, Michael Adebolajo, used it, according to his associates. The substance is legal in Britain but banned in many other countries, including the US, where it is regarded as a narcotic ranked alongside heroin and cocaine. Legal high: A London cafe owner with khat - a leafy stimulant grown in East Africa . Somali community worker Abukar Awale told The Mail on Sunday that police officers had visited several mafrish – the name given to houses devoted to khat chewing – since the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby. ‘I’ve heard they were asking questions about the people frequenting them,’ he said. ‘Some time before the murder, a few of them were closed down by police.’ Extremist Abdul Mumin was seen in a mafrish trying to recruit 'disaffected' youths . In one mafrish – a basement room in a house close to Woolwich mosque – Mr Awale saw extremist preacher Abdul Qadir Mumin, who has been linked to Adebolajo, trying to recruit ‘disaffected’ youths. He said: ‘There were about 20 young men lying around on mattresses, chewing khat, and Mumin was preaching to them, saying that Britain had failed them but that a better life beckoned. He left each of them his card and urged them to get in touch. ‘I am aware of cases in which youths have been recruited in this way. One young man from Woolwich rang his father, who lives in Cardiff, to say that he was on the Somali border. His father immediately called the police, who in turn contacted the Kenyan authorities who arrested his son and deported him, like Adebolajo. ‘Back in Britain he told police that he wasn’t recruited in a mosque – which had been their assumption – but in a mafrish. I am not sure if Adebolajo was recruited in this way but it wouldn’t surprise me.’ In 2010, Adebolajo left South London to try to join the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, of which Mumin is a senior member. Complaining that he was coming under intense scrutiny from the security services, Mumin left for the war-torn country around the same time. Soon after his arrival in Somalia, he burnt his British passport in front of hundreds of supporters while declaring his lifelong support for jihad and vowing never to return to the UK.

The Florida homes on either side of the Tampa area house where a sinkhole opened under a man's bedroom are being demolished. Officials say the demolition will take place today in Seffner, Florida. The homes were condemned on April 1, a month after the sinkhole opened under the house next door, killing 37-year-old Jeffrey Bush. Engineering consultants determined that repairing the homes would cost more than 50 per cent of their value, The Tampa Bay Times reported. To be demolished: Demolition began this morning on two more homes (one pictured) in the Seffner neighborhood where a sinkhole swallowed a man alive in February . Frightening: A bird's eye view shot shows the sinkhole which swallowed Jeff Bush from his bed in February . On Wednesday morning, heavy equipment and trucks will return to the neighborhood to demolish the homes. In February . Jeff Bush, 37, was sucked into the sinkhole while he slept in his . family home in Seffner and when his brother, Jeremy, jumped in the hole . to try to save him, he was nowhere to be seen. Footage . taken by a contractor who examined the hole shortly before the home was . demolished showed that every piece of furniture had vanished. Most . bizarre is how the ground had completely given way - revealing the . brown dirt beneath - yet hats, high-visibility jackets and shelves . remain on the wall above where Bush's bed once was. A day after the accident, authorities stopped their search for Bush as tests showed no sign of life in the hole. The house was torn down and the family hopes to set up a memorial at the site. Neighbours left their properties and the county has said that the houses on each side of the sinkhole house were condemned. 'The results of the geophysical tests concluded that the subsurface soils were unstable as subsidence activity is evidenced at each site,' County Administrator Michael Merrill said. Bizarre: Hats are still hanging on a doorknob in the bedroom in Seffner, Florida yet the ground beneath the wall has completely vanished. The freak accident claimed the life of 37-year-old Jeff Bush, right . Gone: This video still shows the hanging hats, left, above the massive hole in the ground. The video was taken by a contractor shortly before the home was demolished . Bush, 37, was in his bedroom in Seffner - a suburb of 8,000 people 15 miles east of downtown . Tampa - when the earth opened up on the night of February 28. Five others in the house escaped unharmed. Jeremy . Bush, 36, recalled how he desperately tried to pull his brother, Jeff, from the rubble . as he heard his screams for help. 'I ran in there and heard somebody screaming, my brother screaming, and I ran in there,' he told My Fox Tampa Bay . 'And . all I see is this big hole. All I see is the top of his bed. I didn't . see anything else, so I jumped in the hole and tried getting him out. Hidden: The hole was largely hidden beneath the home but was seen as the property was demolished . Crushed: Demolition experts watched as the Bush's home was destroyed three days after his death . 'The . floor was still giving in and the dirt was still going down, but I . didn't care. I wanted to save my brother. I could hear him screaming for . me, hollering for . me. I couldn't do nothing.' Jeremy had tried to save his brother . when he heard him screaming, but was unable to reach him. A deputy . pulled Jeremy out of the sinkhole, and likely saved his life. Following the tragedy, Jeremy Bush said he believed the rescue teams should not have given up so soon. 'I feel like they could . have tried harder to get my brother out of there,' he said. 'That was my . brother. No one is even talking about what my mom and dad are going . through. They don't want to be on camera. My mom and dad are going . through hell right now.' Break down: Jeremy Bush, right, told reporters that not enough was done to get his brother Jeff out of a sinkhole during an emotional interview as the family house was demolished . Remembered: Jeremy Bush set up a makeshift memorial for his brother before demolition began . The 20-foot-wide opening of the sinkhole was almost covered by the . house, and rescuers said there were no signs of life after the hole . opened. Experts say thousands of sinkholes . erupt yearly in Florida because of the state's unique geography, though . most are small and deaths rarely occur. 'There's hardly a place in Florida . that's immune to sinkholes,' said Sandy Nettles, who owns a geology . consulting company. 'There's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole . is going to occur.' Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . A sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities. When this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, . and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion. Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way. According . to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, . Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by . sinkholes. While they often . occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by . human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely . culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed. Source: USGS .","Jeff Bush, 37, was sucked into the hole under his home in February .

From the earliest imaginings of what 'the heavens' were made up of to NASA's latest Curiosity Rover mission on Mars, an unquenchable thirst to conquer, or at least understand, space has pervaded mankind's time on Earth. Now, a new exhibition has brought together more than a hundred awe-inspiring images of space which straddle the line between science and art. The first glimpse of the far side of the Moon, photographed from the Soviet Lunar 3 spacecraft in 1959 . This photograph was taken during one of five expeditions sent by the Royal Observatory at Greenwich to observe the transit of Venus of December 9, 1874 . Drawing of the minute structure of the solar surface by Samuel Pierpont Langley, 1873 . Starting with Galileo, the first person to look at the stars through a telescope, Visions of the Universe charts the development of astronomical imaging. The exhibition, held at the National Maritime Museum, in Greenwich, London, reveals the role astronomers have played in pushing forward the technology of cameras and telescopes, which means we are now able to see the weather on distant planets and look beyond the Milky Way into galaxies beyond. Among the images on show is a photograph taken during one of five expeditions sent by the Royal Observatory at Greenwich to observe the transit of Venus of December 9, 1874. Astronomers were sent to Egypt, Hawaii, New Zealand and islands in the Indian Ocean. Many used photographic plates to record their observations accurately. Meanwhile, a drawing of the minute structure of the solar surface by Samuel Pierpont Langley, in 1873, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, also features. The images also chart the technological advances through the 20th and 21st centuries, showcasing the first glimpse of the far side of the moon and pictures taken by Neil Armstrong in 1969 all the way up to the latest images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

Visitors to the exhibition, which opens on Friday, June 7, will be able to take a visual trip through the solar system featuring images of the moon, the Sun, the planets and deep space, before coming back to Earth to a selection of images that reflect our fascination with the night sky. With views of the dazzling aurora on the surface of Saturn, the spectacular clouds of colourful dust in which new stars are forming thousands of light years away, and the dizzying sight of Earth as seen from the International Space Station, the exhibition celebrates the aesthetic beauty of space photography as well as the scientific discoveries that advances in technology have allowed. The photographs on display include the latest cutting edge images captured by NASA, the Russian space programme and some of the greatest telescopes in the world, as well as highlights from the last four years of the Royal Observatory’s highly successful Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition.

This image of Saturn's rings, taken from the Cassini orbiter spacecraft in 2005, shows how image-processing techniques can be used to convey scientific information which could not otherwise be seen . Organisers have said the centrepiece of the exhibition is the 'Mars Window' - a 13 metre by four metre curved wall onto which the latest images beamed back by NASA’s Mars Curiosity Rover are projected. The effect aims to create the impression of looking through a giant window out onto the rocky Martian landscape. It is the first time a museum exhibition has used images from a current space mission in this way. Other photographic highlights on display include the first astronomical image ever taken; Edwin Hubble’s 1923 photograph which confirmed the existence of galaxies beyond our own; the 1969 image of the first human to walk on the moon; and the astronomical photograph which helped to prove the General Theory of Relativity.

An eight-year-old boy who authorities say died after being beaten had remained in the house where the alleged abuse occurred despite six investigations by social workers during the past decade, a newspaper said. The boy's mother, 29-year-old Pearl . Fernandez, and her 32-year-old boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre, have been . charged with murder. They have not yet entered pleas. Social workers appeared to miss numerous warnings signs at the Palmdale, California, home, the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday, citing county documents. Monstrous allegations: Pearl Sinthia Fernandez (left) and her boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre (right), are accused of torturing and killing the woman's 8-year-old son . Angel: Gabriel, 8, was found unconscious and not breathing, suffering from a fractured skull, cracked ribs and cigarette burns to his body . The boy, Gabriel, had written a note saying he . was thinking about suicide and his teacher told authorities he often . appeared bruised and battered. Fernandez was being held without . bail, while Aguirre was being held on $1 million bail.  It has not yet . been determined if they have lawyers. Gabriel died at a hospital on May 24 . after paramedics went to his house in Palmdale and found that he had a . fractured skull, three broken ribs, BB pellets embedded in his lung and . groin, and two teeth knocked out. The documents obtained by the paper . show Aguirre allegedly told investigators that he beat the boy . repeatedly for lying and being dirty. Pearl Fernandez told paramedics her son's injuries were due to self-mutilation, the paper reported. Meanwhile, four social workers have been given desk duty pending possible disciplinary action. 'I feel like they all should be . fired,' said Elizabeth Carranza, Gabriel's aunt. 'They didn't listen to . my nephew. They were completely deaf and blind.' There were six investigations into abuse allegations involving the mother, with five determining the claims were unfounded. Records show there was an unresolved . case of alleged abuse at the time of Gabriel's death, and an allegation . had lingered two months past a legally mandated deadline for finishing . an investigation. 'The red flags were all over the . place. They were ignored. It is just inexplicable to me,' said county . Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. Crime scene: Firefighters responded to this home in the 200 block of East Avenue Q-10 in Palmdale after receiving a report that a child was not breathing . Horrific claims: Police say Gabriel had marking on his ankles, suggesting that he may have been tied up . Slain angel: The mother of the little boy told police that she was present for his assault, but did nothing to stop it . History of violence: Fernandez had previously been charged with cruelty to a child likely to produce great bodily injury . The county's Department of Children . and Family Services has been trying to institute reforms after dozens of . abuse and neglect deaths in recent years involving children who had . been under the agency's supervision. A recent internal review of the . department found there haven't been any workers fired in 15 cases where . children died. It also has a backlog of child abuse cases. The agency's director Philip Browning . acknowledged the system failed Gabriel. The case illustrates a need for . more critical thinking and common sense in evaluating cases, he said. County social workers became aware of . Pearl Fernandez a decade ago when her oldest son had a head injury . during a car accident. It was determined he wasn't wearing a seat belt. The Times said a relative later . reported she allegedly beat the same son and wanted to disown him. However, social workers said the complaint was unfounded. Family divided: Fernandez's own father said it was his daughter who was responsible for his grandson's death . Gabriel's teacher told authorities in . January there were bruised dots all over the boy's face. Gabriel told . the teacher his mother shot him in the face with a BB gun, records show. The boy often recanted his stories, . and an internal county review criticized social workers for failing to . interview Gabriel in a neutral setting away from his mother, who told . social workers in March she didn't need their help. The boy's therapist told workers . earlier this year that Gabriel once reported being sexually abused by an . older relative, but he later withdrew the allegation. The investigation . remains open. In addition to one count of murder . each, the charges against Fernandez and Aguirre include a . special-circumstance allegation of torture. Gabriel’s grandfather told NBC Los Angeles in Spanish that he believes it was his daughter, Fernandez, who is responsible for her son's death. He said that the child had lived with the grandparents until five months ago, but the 29-year-old mother was allowed to regain custody of him. Aguirre's family rallied around him, with his mother and other relatives insisting that he is innocent. 'He loved those kids. She did it, and everybody knows she did it. Even her family knows she did it,' said Aguirre's cousin. Fernandez had previously been charged with cruelty to a child likely to produce great bodily injury. Public outcry: Protesters carrying posters and pictures of Gabriel gathered outside the courtroom, demanding justice and blaming the Department of Child and Family Services for failing to protect the little boy .","Social workers investigated the household six times over the past decade .

In response, the . designer said: 'Toilet paper? Support stockings? Condoms?' But perhaps realising how many products bear his brand already, Lagerfeld began to backtrack, adding: 'But maybe… You know, I am mainstream.' He also told the magazine of the things that make him lose his cool, saying: 'Things that are not happening as I wish [make me angry]. The things that take time. 'And people who say they are bored, even though I don't spend time with these kinds of people. 'I think that it's a crime to say you are bored when time is so precious and there are so many things to do in life: read, learn, watch.' Boy band JLS made headlines in 2010 when they partnered up with Durex to release a line of branded condoms. Aston Merrygold, Marvin Humes, Oritsé Williams and JB Gill posed for photographs as they released the range, called Just Love Safe, which they hoped would encourage people to have safe sex. The four different packs of extra safe condoms featured each band member's favourite colour and were branded with the boys' faces. Marvin said of the range: 'We came up . with the idea of Just Love Safe as we wanted to send a clear message . out to fans that are over 16 and sexually active - and that is to always . use a condom during sex... it's important to put your love in a glove.'

'Absurd': Roland Wright, 82, denies 13 charges of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child . A former headmaster of a top private school today claimed allegations that he sexually abused his pupils had been made up by 'frustrated under-achievers looking for an excuse'. Roland Peter Wright, 82, today denied the charges against him as he told a jury that he had never touched any boys at Caldicott Perparatory school. He claimed the accusations against him were malicious and denied any impropriety during the period in question from 1959 to 1970. 'I've had the experience of being school governor at five different schools where there have been instances of this nature,' Wright told a jury at Aylesbury Crown Court. 'They were all concerning men in their 40s and 50s who had not achieved as much as they would have liked to achieve.' When prosecutor John Price said that his stance was 'absurd' Wright responded saying: 'It's not absurd, because it's true.' Wright, is facing 13 charges of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child at the school where Nick Clegg was a pupil. Wright was asked about an allegation that he once stroked the inside of a boy's groin in his car as he drove him home after a rugby match. He replied: 'I deny that. I might have patted him or touched him, but not stroked. There's a big difference there. Tapping and patting are not sensual, but stroking is.' The jury has been told Wright encouraged an atmosphere of sexual freedom among the boys at the school, and abused boys as they slept at night in their dormitories, touched them in his car, and on a school trip to Scotland. Some of the alleged sexual encounters were said to have taken place at his teacher's cottage where he still lives near the school grounds in Crown Lane, Farnham Royal. Police started investigating the well-known headmaster in 2001, when five former boys claimed they were molested at the school. Although 12 boys eventually made accusations against him, Wright was charged in August last year for allegations relating to seven of the children - now aged in their late 50s or 60s. None of the men can be named for legal reasons. Some of the accusers played for the school's rugby team, and the jury heard their names appear in meticulous handwritten records Wright made of matches which were kept in faded exercise books in a desk draw in his personal study. Wright was accused of not mentioning the records to police officers, which he said he had moved from his desk to a cupboard following his arrest in November 2011. However, the former teacher claimed it was the police's fault that the books had not come to light until the trial was into its seventh week. Wright said: 'I did not conceal them... I did not suppress them. It was just a complete botched search. I was amazed to discover all my information from the school was still intact. It could have been easily found and it was not hidden.' He also admitted he had had a recent 'clear out' of rubbish, which included throwing away calendars from his time at Caldicott. Wright taught at the school from 1952 and became headteacher in 1968 until his retirement in 1993. 'Absurd': The retired headteacher told a jury he never touched any boys at the exlusive prep school in a 'sensual' way . Police began investigating him in 2001 after one former pupil told his doctor  that he had been abused. The jury has heard the victims had described Wright as 'gentle' towards them, and would not threaten them.One, who is the subject of two current charges, even described him as 'inspirational'. Another pupil, who later enjoyed success as an amateur rugby player, attributed this to Wright, who coached the school's team as well as teaching French. The victim, who is not one of the seven on the indictment, revealed that the abuse had taken place. However, he was reluctant to initially lay the blame with Wright as he had been a family friend as well as a teacher. One fellow pupil had witnessed Wright touching that boy's penis while on a school trip to Scotland - but left the hotel room once he realised what was happening and said that nothing was ever said about what had occurred. All of the allegations relate to Wright's tenure at prestigious Caldicott Preparatory School, which was founded in Hitchin, Hertfordshire in 1904 and moved to its present site in 1938. It became a charitable trust in 1968. The £20,000 per year school, which has capacity for 240 boys aged between seven and 13, boasts 40 acres of grounds and playing fields. Many pupils go on to elite secondar schools including Harrow, Eton and Wellington College. Caldicott counts deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg among its high-profile alumni, along with former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss and actor Ed Stoppard - the son of playwright Tom. Clegg joined the school as a pupil in 1975 before later moving to the prestigious Westminster School.The trial continues.

It’s no surprise, then, that its universe is expanding. Although this XCOM spin-off has been in development since 2006, numerous facelifts have transformed what was once a first-person shooter into a third-person adventure. But thankfully, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified promises to retain the tactical element fans have come to expect from the series. Changed for the better: Although reaction was mixed when 2K Marin first unveiled the game, transforming it into a third-person shooter seems like a sensible move . Developed by 2K Marin, the team behind Bioshock 2, Declassified is set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War. Originally established as America’s covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before. As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic. Similar to the previous game, your decisions have a serious impact on the overall result. Every command can mean the difference between life and death for Carter, his squad and mankind. Carter can also use a unique Battle Focus ability – although exact details about how this works have not been revealed. It has also been reported that Declassifed is a single player experience, and will not feature any sort of multiplayer. ‘We’re thrilled about 2K Marin’s refined vision for The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,' said Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K. 'The game has evolved through a creative and iterative development process, and the result is a narrative-driven experience that is smart, engaging, and challenges players to think tactically.' Watch this space: There is still no word yet on whether Declassified will be coming to next-gen consoles . He added: ‘The team has been working hard to leverage core XCOM elements like tactical decision-making and permanent death of squad mates in a purposeful way that makes this a unique tactical shooter. ‘To that end, The Bureau will challenge players unlike any other third-person tactical shooter.’ It's set for release on August 20 in North America and August 23 internationally.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, hinted the Government may channel money saved from departmental budgets into infrastructure projects . Ministers are to pump billions of pounds into big infrastructure projects after being urged to boost growth by the International Monetary Fund. In a speech last night, Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, indicated that Chancellor George Osborne will funnel cash from day-to-day departmental budgets into major building projects. In a speech to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, Mr Alexander vowed to ‘stick to the path we are on’ economically and rejected Labour’s calls for more borrowing to fund investment. But he said: ‘We will continue to show flexibility wherever it is needed, and to shift resources wherever we can to support economic growth.’ He added: 'For key areas of capital . expenditure - like infrastructure - we intend to make commitments right . through to the end of the decade.' Mr Alexander stressed that the Treasury was taking a ‘zero-based approach’ to capital projects in the spending review, requiring departments to show that every scheme they propose will generate economic benefits. He said: ‘When we took such an approach in 2010, it resulted in the most economically important areas being prioritised. 'So investment in transport, for example, was not just protected from cuts, its budget was actually increased in every year, which has enabled us to commit to crucial projects like High Speed 2.’ Danny Alexander said the Coalition has shown its willingness to invest in infrastructure projects by committing to HS2 railway . His comments suggest the government is listening to the IMF, which last week called for ministers to shift current spending into infrastructure projects to boost growth in the economy. But Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie accused the government of dragging its feet. He said: ‘George Osborne has invested billions less in infrastructure than the plans he inherited, meaning housebuilding is at record lows and the construction sector is shrinking. ‘Ministers should listen to the IMF, which said that infrastructure investment must be brought forward right now. Decisive action this year would not only create jobs and growth now but strengthen our economy for the long-term. Major infrastructure projects have also been beset by dithering and delay.’","Danny Alexander hints Government will invest in infrastructure .

'No confidence': 13 of Boston's 14 deputy fire chiefs co-signed a letter blasting their boss Steve Abraira (pictured) saying that he showed no leadership at the Boston Marathon bombing . The embattled Boston Fire Chief Steve E. Abraira resigned on Monday after clashes with senior staff over his management style and his perceived weak handling of the Boston Marathon bombings. Abraira was the first chief in Boston Fire Department's history hired from outside of its powerful union and since the April 15th terror attack he came under pressure from his 13 deputy chief, all who have risen up through the city ranks. He will leave his post on June 7th and Deputy Chief John Hasson will step in to take temporary charge according to Stephen MacDonald, a spokesman for the Boston fire department. In May, the Boston Globe obtained a leaked letter that 13 of the city's 14 deputy fire chiefs co-signed on April 26th signalling a vote of no-confidence in Chief Steve Abraira. 'His justification for failing to take action is indefensible,' they wrote. That was just 11 days after the bombings at the finish line of the marathon killed three people and injured more than 250 others. In his resignation letter, Abraira said that he was leaving his job because of the 'baseless attacks by the Deputy Chiefs, especially their actions of making this a matter of public debate by leaking their letter of April 26th to the press, has made it impossible for me to continue to do my job.' Mr Abraira initially defended himself in May, saying that is a 'nationally accepted practice' for the top chief to continue to allow his deputies to handle the situation if everything seems to be working, rather than insert themselves into a situation that is already being controlled. Swearing In: Steve E. Abraira is sworn in as the Boston Fire Department's Chief of the Department in November 2011 . Chaos: Police and some fire officials were already at the bomb site when the two pressure cooker bombs went off but more were immediately dispatched . 'When I got there I was comfortable with what was going on,' he told The Globe. 'You only take command (as chief) if there’s something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it’s overwhelming for the incident commander, and none of those things were in fact happening.' However, in his resignation letter dated June 3rd, Abraira said that he never had the support of his deputies and was left with no choice but to resign. 'Your selection of me as Chief never had the support of a number of . members of the Department who preferred that the Chief be selected from . within the ranks of the Department itself,' Abraira said in the letter. 'I think it is also fair to say that unfortunately a vocal and . aggressive minority of the members of the Department did not support our . efforts.' Under control: Overall, the emergency response to the bombings has been widely praised as three people died on the scene but all of the more than 250 others who were able to get to a hospital were saved . The deputies- with the exception of one who did not sign the no-confidence letter- said in their April letter that this is not the first time they have been disappointed by Mr Abraira's actions. They even mention an instance where there was a six-alarm fire in a Boston building and after he allegedly cleared the scene of being under control by the deputies, Mr Abraira went to the roof of the building next door to take a picture of himself with the flames in the background for his scrapbook. Mr Abraira vehemently denied the story to The Globe, saying that it never happened. One thing he doesn't deny is that he changed the department's protocol when he came into office in November 2011, making it so that he would not automatically become the so-called 'incident commander' at a fire as soon as he arrived. He justified the move saying that before changing the operating procedure, he polled 29 other city fire departments around the country and the only one that still made the Fire Chief the incident commander was in New Haven, Connecticut. His deputies don't see the move as one out of public safety but more out of self-preservation. Protocols: Abraira changed the procedure for the department when he took office so that he is not automatically made the incident commander when he arrives at the scene of a fire . '(Mr Abraira) shields himself from immediate accountability while setting the stage for under­mining the confidence and authority of his command staff. While acknowledging his ultimate accountability for depart­ment operations, he avoids on-the-scene responsibility,' they wrote in the letter. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's office confirmed it had . received the resignation letter but said it had no immediate comment. Menino, who is in the final year of a two-decade run as mayor, had . previously said he would stand by Abraira. The . criticism of Abraira stands in contrast to praise offered to Boston . Police Commissioner Ed Davis, who became one of the best-known faces of . Boston's response. The department’s current chief of operations, . John Hasson, has been named acting chief, MacDonald said. Hasson was one . of the 13 deputy chiefs who signed the April letter. A woman who answered the phone . Monday at the Boston Firefighters Local 718 said union officials weren’t . commenting on Abraira’s resignation. Menino’s office referred comment . to MacDonald. Abraira, the city’s first Hispanic . chief, was also the first hired from outside the department’s own . union. He led the Dallas department and was an assistant chief in Miami . before coming to Boston in 2011. In his resignation letter, Abraira . said his outsider status hindered his efforts to fulfill his mission to . modernize the department. ‘A number of members ... preferred that the Chief be selected from within the ranks of the Department itself,’ he wrote. ‘I think it is also fair to say . that unfortunately a vocal and aggressive minority of the members of the .

A mongrel dog that lost her snout and upper jaw saving the lives of two young girls in the Philippines is heading home after being patched up at a California hospital. Sadly, doctors couldn't reconstruct Kabang's missing snout but they were able to heal the dog's wounds and treat other ailments, before she was released on Monday from the University of California, Davis veterinary hospital. Kabang had her snout and upper jaw sheared off in December 2011 when she jumped in front of a motorcycle. Scroll down for video . Cured: Kabang, a two-year-old injured mixed breed, chews on a toy after being released from the from the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis, . Wounds: Sadly, doctors couldn't reconstruct the snout of Kabang, pictured with caregiver Dawn Gillette . Home: Kabang, pictured, is heading home to the Philippines after being released from hospital on Monday . Newspapers in the Philippines reported she saved the lives of her owner's daughter and niece, who were apparently in the path of the oncoming bike. UC Davis veterinary professor Frank Verstraete said Kabang was in hospital for seven months but doctors were unable to reconstruct her snout and jaw. After the animal's heroic act, doctors discovered Kabang was also suffering life-threatening cancer, and got to work treating her with a dose of chemotherapy. After completing six weekly intravenous chemotherapy infusions, the hospital announced in December that Kabang appeared to have beaten the cancer she was suffering from, Gina Davis, the primary care veterinarian at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital in Davis, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Procedure: Veterinary surgeon Boaz Arzi, left, describes how a nasal opening was created in the face of Kabang . Faceless dog: The dog's snout and jaw was ripped off in the motorbike accident in 2011 . Cancer: Brave Kabang was also treated for undiagnosed cancer during his seven-month hospital stay . The dog, however, was still undergoing treatment for heartworms in her arteries before she was able to have the gaping wound on her face closed. Full treatment of that condition was put on hold during cancer therapy. Kabang had the first of three arsenic-based heartworm shots on December 4 and received the other two in the second week of January. 'It will be one to two months for her to recover from that before she goes in and has the surgery,' Davis said in December. The horrific accident occurred in . December 2011 when the daughter of Kabang’s owner, nine-year-old Dina . Bunggal, and her cousin three-year old Princess Diansing, were playing . with the dog in Zamboanga City, Philippines. The dog ended up in Davis hospital in 2012 after a nurse from Buffalo, New York, spearheaded a fundraising campaign to bring her to the U.S. Veterinarians in the Philippines were apparently unable to treat her injuries. Helping a hero: Kabang's facial surgery was been postponed after veterinarians at University of California at Davis discovered a tumour and heartworm . Good girl: Kabang was hailed as a hero in the Philippines after saving two girls by jumping in front of a speeding bike, which left her severely disfigured . Treatment: Dr. Anton Lim plays with Kabang after her arrival at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at University of California Davis . Care For Kabang raised over $20,000 from 22 countries to cover the costs of surgeries, visas and airfare. Surgeons were planning to perform two or three procedures. The first involved dental work, extractions and covering exposed roots. They then closed the dog's wound and restore nasal functions. Prior to the surgeries, the dog's bony structures were exposed to air, increasing the chance of infection, Davis said. Kabang will now return to he owners in the Philippines. The bill for her treatment is expected to top $10,000. Close call: Doctors in the Philippines suggested that Kabang's owner put her down, but he would hear none of it . Grateful dog: Kabang was found in a rice paddy as a puppy and was nearly killed for meat, but her owner's daughter and niece pleaded for her life . Global effort: A New York nurse helped raise more than $20,000 from 22 countries to pay for Kabang's medical care in the U.S. Davis said in December that despite Kabang's many conditions, the dog appeared to be in good spirits. 'She has come through everything very well,' Davis said. 'Her appetite is still good. She's still bright and happy.' Kabang's face became tangled in the spokes of the bike's wheel, and her entire upper jaw was torn off. Kabang, who became a mother to six . little puppies in April 2012, had a rough start in life when Dina's . father Rudy found her abandoned in a rice paddy. He brought the dog home to fatten her . up and feed her to the family, but his daughter and niece convinced him . to spare Kabang and keep her as a pet - a lucky move for both dog and . family.","Kabang the dog's snout and upper jaw sheared off in December 2011 when she jumped in front of a motorcycle in the Philippines .

The Mars rover Curiosity has been investigating the Martian weather around it and the soil beneath it, as its controllers prepare for the car-size vehicle's first drive on Mars. Last night the rover wiggled its wheels to test its motor system, and Nasa was set to send the rover its first driving commands. Scroll down for video . Handling's out of this world: Nasa's Curiosity Rovers tests its steering during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars . 'Late tonight, we plan to send Curiosity . the commands for doing our first drive tomorrow,' Curiosity . Mission Manager Michael Watkins of JPL said last night. 'We'll . drive about three meters forward, and then turn, and then drive back a . little less than that ... We don't back up right to the same location . that we are in right now.' If . the test, set to last around 90 minutes, is a success, Curiosity will . leave its landing spot in three or four days, Mr Watkins said. If all goes to plan Curiosity will end up parked at 90 degrees to its . original touchdown position. 'We want to park in a place we've exactly . examined. 'We just want to be extra safe,' said Mr Watkins. 'We have a couple more activities to complete before we start driving,' he said. Curiosity . will first head in the direction of Glenelg, a spot in Gale Crater less . than 500 meters (yards) away from its current position. The site . contains three different kinds of terrain that NASA scientists aim to . explore. Preparing to drive: Nasa released high resolution images of the rover's extended arm as it sent the rovers commands for its first drive on the red planet . It checks air temperature, . ground temperature, air pressure, wind and other variables every hour at . the landing site in Gale Crater. On a typical Martian day, or ""sol,""  based on measurements so far in the two-week old mission, air temperatures swing from 28 degrees to minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 to minus 75 Celsius), Nasa said. Ground temperatures change even more between afternoon and pre-dawn morning, from 37 degrees to minus 132 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to minus 91 Celsius). 'We will learn about changes from day to day and season to season,' said Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Centro de Astrobiología, Madrid, Spain, principal investigator for the suite of weather sensors called the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS). Within a week or so, daily Mars weather reports from Curiosity will become available. However, the mission also hit its first problem as scientists found one of the two sets of wind sensors is not providing data. 'One possibility is that pebbles lofted during the landing hit the delicate circuit boards on one of the two REMS booms,' said Curiosity Deputy Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Another new image of Curiosity's extended arm surveying the Martian landscape. Researchers found one of two wind sensors on it had not survived the landing, and believe it may have been broken by a pebble . 'We will have to be more clever about using the remaining wind sensor to get wind speed and direction.' An instrument provided by Russia is checking for water bound into minerals in the top three feet (one meter) of soil beneath the rover. It employs a technology that is used in oil prospecting on Earth, but had never before been sent to another planet. 'Curiosity has begun shooting neutrons into the ground,' said Igor Mitrofanov of Space Research Institute, Moscow, principal investigator for this instrument, called the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons, or DAN. 'We measure the amount of hydrogen in the soil by observing how the neutrons are scattered, and hydrogen on Mars is an indicator of water.' The most likely hydrogen to be found in shallow ground of Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, is in hydrated minerals. These are minerals with water molecules, or related ions, bound into the crystalline structure of rocks. They can tenaciously retain water from a wetter past after all free water has gone. Images released last night show theCuriosity Rover is seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars. Engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one-ton vehicle's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days. The images were taken by one of Curiosity's navigation cameras.

Curiosity landed on Mars two weeks ago to begin a two-year mission using . 10 instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside . Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for . microbial life. The Mars rover Curiosity zapped its first rock on Sunday with a high-powered laser gun designed to analyze Martian mineral content, and scientists declared their target practice a success. The robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist-sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10-second period, NASA said in a statement issued from mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Los Angeles. Each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one-billionths of a second, vapourising a pinhead-sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark, which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument. The ionized glow, which can be . observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away, is then split into its . component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists . information about the chemical makeup of the target rock. Curiosity has begun its science mission on Mars by 'zapping' a rock with its laser analysis equipment . The combined system, called the Chemistry-and-Camera instrument, or ChemCam, is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet, infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout Curiosity's Mars mission. The purpose of Sunday's initial use of the laser, conducted at roughly 3 a.m. Pacific time (7.00 a.m. EDT), was as 'target practice' for the instrument. But scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock, which they dubbed 'Coronation,' NASA said. 'We got a great spectrum of Coronation - lots of signal,' said ChemCam principal investigator Roger Wiens of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument was developed. 'After eight years of building the instrument, it's payoff time.' Curiosity's two-year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like Earth could have hosted microbial life.

The rover's primary target is Mount Sharp, a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of Gale Crater. But mission controllers are gradually checking out Curiosity's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the Martian landscape. The $2.5 billion Curiosity project marks NASA's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes to Mars during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world. The technique employed by ChemCam has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments, such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor. Curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3-mile-high (5-kilometer-high) mountain, called Mount Sharp . The technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection. But Sunday's exercise, conducted during Curiosity's 13th full day on Mars, was the first use in interplanetary exploration, NASA said. Before Curiosity embarks on its 4.3-mile (7-km) trek to the foot of Mount Sharp, a journey that could take six months, mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site.

Paedophile Bridger was last week handed a full life term and told he will die behind bars. But in an emotional interview Dai and Linda Smith said they still feel justice has not been done. Mr Smith, stepfather of April’s father Paul, advocated the used of capital punishment for child  murderers and suggested those convicted of the crime should be made to ‘suffer’. Jailed: Bridger is seen being led away by prison guards after he was sentenced to life behind bars at Mold Crown Court this week . Victim: The grandparents of murdered April Jones, pictured, say that prison is not enough of a punishment for her killer . He said: ‘Jail is too good for them. I think they should bring back hanging or the injection or something like that. But I think they should suffer first… like April had to suffer.’ His wife Linda added: ‘There’s no justice they can give him that will ever bring April back – there’s nothing they can do that will ever compensate for taking her life away. ‘I don’t think we’ll ever come to terms with it. It’s like a dream.’ Local MP Glyn Davies, a long-term opponent of capital punishment, last night admitted the five-year-old’s murder had tested his beliefs ‘like never before’. He said: ‘I accept the logical next step is to admit he should go to the gallows and it’s not difficult justifying that. ‘In fact, it’s probably the view most people around here hold.’ 'Not good enough': Mark Bridger is currently in Strangeways prison in Manchester . The 69-year-old, father-of-four added: ‘My dilemma is that I’ve never been so close to this terrible sort of thing happening before – especially in this community. ‘Now we’ve all been touched by Bridger’s wickedness which,  inevitably, makes us re-think our views on capital punishment and about how such a crime must never be allowed to happen again and look closely at what steps can be taken to hopefully stop it. ‘Part of that process is giving serious thought to whether hanging is the deterrent. After what’s happened to April, I simply don’t know any more. ‘In the past I never thought it was either a proper deterrent or punishment. Now, like many others, I simply don’t know the right answers any more. ‘It’s a scenario I’ll now have to give a great deal of serious thought to and re-address.’ ‘Such a crime must never be allowed to happen again.’ The heartbroken parents of April Jones have suffered a setback to their wish of seeing Mark Bridger’s ‘toxic’ house demolished and turned into a memorial garden. Coral and Paul Jones want the three-bedroom, whitewashed Mount Pleasant cottage knocked down but police say it must stay untouched, in case Bridger launches an appeal. The £150,000 property is owned by Mark Ford, who rented it to Bridger for £450-a-month. House of horrors: Police stand guard at the home of Mark Bridger in Ceinws, Mid Wales, during the investigation into April's kidnap and murder . Collecting evidence: A forensics officer leaves the home of Mark Bridger during the search for April's body . A family friend said: ‘The cottage is a constant reminder of what happened to April. Coral and Paul would like to see it knocked down and most people in Machynlleth want to see it go too. ‘Everyone shudders every time they pass the place – it should be taken down brick by brick.’ A trail of April’s blood was found leading into the bathroom where blood was found on the door, tiles, shower curtain and inside a washing machine. Another trail led into the  lounge and towards Bridger’s fireplace, where a burnt boning knife and traces of a child’s skull were discovered. Demolished: Other notorious addresses such as 25 Cromwell Street, the home of Fred and Rosemary West, have been knocked down . Blood had soaked through the carpet in front of the fireplace with traces also found on the concrete underneath. Bridger spent hours in the house drinking vodka and looking at indecent images of children. In the past other notorious horror houses such as Fred West’s home at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, have been demolished. A police spokesman said: ‘It has to be retained as a crime scene pending an appeal. ‘The owner is insistent he does not want to make any comment about the property whatsoever at this stage.’","Dai and Linda Smith said that they feel justice has not been done .

Former world number one Becker's blonde hair was swept back, in stark contrast to Johnson's trademark scruffy locks. Their rosy cheeks as they smiled for the cameras added to the likeness. Dad? Stanley Johnson (centre) shares a drink with Boris and Boris . Confusion between the pair went global last year, when the London Mayor went on a six-day visit to India. At an event in Mumbai which saw the handing over of petals from the . Olympic Cauldron to Indian athletes, the Old Etonian was asked if he . was the Wimbledon legend. Akash Bharadia, an 18-year-old on a gap year volunteering at the temple, . said: 'One of the locals shouted out it was Boris Becker while some . people asked whether he was the King of England. They know it's Boris, that's the main thing.' Confusion: Crowds thought the London Mayor was Boris Becker during a visit to India last year . Certainly if Johnson had picked up a tennis racket it would soon have become clear he was not the former world champion. In 2011 he admitted defeat after facing several vollies from schoolchidren in London. 'You can be completely hopeless at sport, as indeed I am,' he said at the time. 'But you can still get something out of it, you can still enjoy it and you can learn about defeat which is a vital skill for everybody to learn.' He also squared up to David Cameron in a game of wheelchair tennis ahead of the Paralympic Games, although Johnson has always preferred table tennis - or wiff-waff as he calls it. Champion: Becker won six Grand Slams, including securing victory at Wimbledon three times . Athlete: Johnson tried his hand at tennis during the International Paralympic Day in 2011 . They have also both made headlines for all the wrong reasons, after fathering secret love children. Becker famously had sex with model Angela Ermakova in London's Nobu restaurant in 1999. He claims the romp was over in 'five seconds' but produced a daughter, Anna, and cost him his marriage. It had long been thought that the pair had sex in a broom cupboard. But in 2009 Becker revealed in a TV interview: 'I don't know if a bathroom is a better place but it actually happened on the stairs between the bathrooms so there was no broom cupboard.' Meanwhile, earlier this month a court ruled that the public does have a right to know about Boris Johnson’s philandering past. The Appeal Court rejected claims by Helen Macintyre, with whom the married Mayor of London had an affair, that the birth of their daughter Stephanie must remain secret. Speculation over the paternity of Stephanie, who has a wild mop of flaxen hair and instantly recognisable features, surfaced the summer after her birth in November 2009.","Striking resemblance between tennis ace and London mayor .

Chancellor George Osborne was forced to defend his mortgage scheme from claims it would push up house prices and help people buy second homes . Government plans to kick-start mortgage lending in a bid to boost growth will simply drive up house prices, the Treasury watchdog warned yesterday. Claims that the scheme to help first-time buyers and those trading up will lead to an increase in house building were dismissed by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Director Robert Chote said it will simply raise prices while planning restrictions hold back house building. ‘I suspect that more of it would have showed up in prices than in quantities,’ he said. Chancellor George Osborne also faced claims from MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that his Help To Buy plans will simply fuel another house price bubble. Labour’s Andy Love accused Mr Osborne of deliberately seeking to boost the property market so people feel better off but warned that would simply price more people out of the market. In last week’s Budget, Mr Osborne outlined plans to help those who cannot afford to put down a 20 per cent deposit on a property. From January, buyers will have to find 5 per cent with the government underwriting the other 15 per cent with a repayment when the home is sold. A separate scheme will see the government share equity with home buyers in new build properties. The OBR’s Steve Nickell also gave a lukewarm welcome to the Help to Buy scheme. On the up: House prices have rise in almost all regions since the 2008 crash, most sharply in London and the South East . Chancellor George Osborne last week promoted his house buying package on a visit to a development in Woolwich, south east London . ‘The key issue is, is it just going . to drive up house prices?’ he told the Committee. ‘By and large in the . short run, the answer to that is yes. ‘In the medium term, will the . increased house prices stimulate more house building? And our general . answer to that would probably be a bit, but the historical evidence . would suggest not very much. ‘Prices will go up and one would hope that that would impact on house builders, but probably not very much.’ But Tory Andrew Tyrie, the committee . chairman, warned that he risked ‘ploughing money back into the boom-bust . property cycle’ while the supply of housing will only ‘increase later, . if at all’. John Cridland, director general of . the CBI, Britain’s biggest lobby group, has also raised his fears that . the Help To Buy scheme could trigger fresh ‘dangers’ of a house price . ‘bubble.’ Quizzed by the MPs, Chancellor repeatedly refused to say whether he thinks house prices will rise. OBR chairman Robert Chote said there was little scope in the planning system to build more homes so the mortgage scheme was likely to force up house prices . ‘I don’t detect that we’re in the middle of a housing boom,’ he said. ‘I think we’re in a very difficult . situation, where the mortgage market is impaired, where very high . deposits are being demanded of people, and families are being priced out . of the housing market. That is neither economically right nor socially . fair.’ Quizzed by the MPs, the Chancellor repeatedly refused to say whether he thinks house prices will rise. He told the Treasury Committee that it . is not his ‘intention’ to help those purchasing a second home but again . refused to rule out that possibility. Example: The proposed scheme is split into two separate streams, the first (above) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second (below) for everyone else . But he added: ‘The absolutely clear . intention of the scheme is to help people buy their first home or move . home as their family grows.’ He also used his appearance at the . Committee to denounce his Conservative critics who have demanded radical . measures to slash tax or spending further. He told the MPs: ‘You get the argument . from some Right-wing economists that what the economy needs is shock . therapy. I would argue the British . economy has had quite enough shock therapy in the last three or four years.’ Example: The proposed scheme is split into two separate streams, the first (above) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second for everyone else .","Office for Budget Responsibility says Chancellor's flagship Budget plan will do little to boost building but flood the market with buyers .

This is the stunning aftermath of the largest landslide ever recorded in North America, which saw 165 million tons of earth dropping more than a half mile at a Utah copper mine last month. The natural disaster cut mining production in half at the Bingham Canyon Mine after the April 10 incident. Operators rushed to bring out all workers and equipment from the mine before a massive landslide ripped through the canyon. It started at the mine's northeastern corner and then plummeted to very bottom of the mine, some six-tenths of a mile down. Miraculously, there were no injuries. Landslide brought it down: The devastation at the Bingham Canyon Mine outside of Salt Lake City. The mine's production was cut in half after the natural disaster . According to Kennecott Copper Corp., the . London-based company that operates the mine, more than 165 million tons . of earth had fallen in the landslide. Production at the mine was cut in half due to the disaster. In a message to customers, Kennecott representatives said that shipments of refined copper would continue as normal through April, but that May deliveries would be down and 'thereafter, we do not anticipate the ability to make further shipments for the foreseeable future' Production began at the mines again in late April, but only limited operations. In an effort to reduce costs at the slide-damaged mine, Kennecott has offered 270 workers in their 50s or older a $20,000 early retirement bonus in addition to pension and health insurance benefits. About a third of these workers are planning on taking the retirement, Union officials told the Associated Press May 31. The workers have until Saturday to accept or reject the plan. Aftermath: A mining truck hauls rock from the Kennecott Copper Corp. owned Bingham Canyon Mine after the April 10 landslide . The company, which employed 2,100 employees, had been looking to reduce costs with layoffs ever since a massive landslide hit the Bingham Canyon Mine. According to Jeff Moore, a geological engineer at the University of Utah, this was the largest landslide North America has had to date. 'It's so big it's hard to sense and feel,' Moore told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'We haven't had something of this magnitude since [Montana's] Earthquake Lake' Moore estimates that around 85 million to 92 million cubic yards of rock and dirt, along with copper, gold, silver and molybdenum were moved. Moore explains this amount of earth as being able to fill 21 Great Pyramids of Giza, or if it were spread out over New York City's Central Park, it would be 65 feet deep. More...

They include a radical floating 'sky crane' as part of a descent dubbed the 'seven minutes of terror'. Scroll down for video . Insatiable Curiosity: The rover captivating the globe in a bid to find life on the red planet . But the plucky rover won't be alone - across the globe, thousands are . expected to watch online and on TV as it approaches the red planet. Nasa has even done a deal to show it in Times Square, while space fans elsewhere are planning parties. 'In the city that never sleeps, the historic Times Square will be the . place for New Yorkers to participate in this historic landing,' John . Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science missions, said. When you think of all the big news events . in history, you think of Times Square, and I can think of no better . venue to celebrate this news-making event on Mars.' The landing will be shown on the big screen in Times Square . The Curiosity rover has taken the public's imagination by . storm, in one of the most daring space missions ever attempted. The rover, Curiosity, is designed to search for clues about possible . past life in a crater that might once have been filled with water. The . £1.59 billion six-wheeled machine is twice as long and five times as . heavy as the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity which landed on Mars in . 2004. Two British scientists are members of the team which will direct the rover and analyse the data it collects. The Times Square broadcast begins at 11:30 p.m. EDT Sunday night and runs until 4 . a.m. EDT Monday morning (Aug. 6). The exact time of landing is scheduled . for 1:31 a.m. Aug. 6 EDT (0531 GMT), though it will be late Monday . night at the rover's California-based mission control room. Nasa has a full list of US events to watch the landing here. Dr John Bridges, from the University of Leicester Space Research Centre, one of the British scientists working on the Mars Science Laboratory mission, said: 'I’m cautiously optimistic. 'Space exploration is not for the faint hearted. 'The previous rover landing used inflatable bouncing bags. Curiosity’s just too heavy for that, so they developed the sky crane technique.' Curiosity’s target is Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, where there are geological signs of past water. The plan is to land close to Mount Sharp, a 5.5-kilometre peak in the centre of the crater with clay deposits around its base. If all goes well the radio signal confirming that Curiosity has landed will arrive on Earth after a 14-minute journey through space at 06.31, UK time. For one Martian year - 98 Earth weeks - Curiosity will explore its surroundings using its robot arm and a formidable array of scientific instruments to analyse samples drilled from rocks or scooped from the ground. It also carries a laser capable of zapping rocks up to 30 feet away, vaporising tiny amounts of material in a flash of light that can be analysed to reveal chemical data. As well carrying a stereo camera to take panoramic shots, Curiosity will be equipped with a magnifying imager that can reveal details smaller than the width of a human hair. Geologist Professor Sanjeev Gupta, from Imperial College London, the other British scientist involved in the mission, said: 'Nasa chose Gale Crater as the landing site because it has a number of really exciting geological features that we are hoping to explore. Target: The known as Gale crater area where Nasa's Curiosity rover will land on August 5 . 'These include a canyon and what appears to be a lake bed on the floor of the crater, as well as a channel and a delta, which we think may have been carved by water. After entering the Martian atmosphere at 13,200mph, the capsule containing Curiosity will be slowed by friction and then a supersonic parachute. An 'upper stage' resembling a flying bedstead will then be deployed, firing retro rockets to brake its descent. As it hovers over the landing site, the upper stage will transform itself into a 'sky crane' and lower Curiosity to the surface on the end of a tether. It will then break away, and deliberately crash. 'We will use the rover’s cameras, including one which is like a powerful magnifying glass, to study the geology up close.' Dr Bridges and Prof Gupta will be based at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, during the mission. They will be among hundreds of scientists who will work together round the clock analysing data beamed back from Curiosity, planning experiments and guiding the rover’s excursions. Dr Bridges said a key goal is to study the clay sediments at the foot of Mount Sharp. Scientists believe they are a reminder of a time, three to four billion years ago, when there was abundant water on the surface of Mars. 'The clay layers may represent what we loosely call a warm and wet period in Martian history,' said Dr Bridges. 'On the top of the mountain the rock was deposited under dry conditions, so there was a great environmental change. 'There’s this idea that Mars was warm and wet long ago, but we don’t know how long there were standing bodies of water on Mars, whether they were short lived or lasted hundreds of millions of years. 'That’s important to the question of whether life ever existed there. Although we’ve made enormous strides in understanding Mars over the last 10 or 20 years, there’s still a lot we don’t know.'

A former Army helicopter pilot has spoken of his excitement at being chosen to spend six months on board the International Space Station. Major Tim Peake’s mission to the International Space Station will see the 41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan in November 2015. Today Prime Minister David Cameron hailed his mission as a 'momentous day for Britain' Scroll down for video . Major Tim Peake's mission to the International Space Station will see the 41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan in November 2015, it was revealed at London's Science Museum today. Major Peake is the only Briton ever to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps. His mission will make him the first UK national to travel and work in space, under the Union Jack, on a British Government-funded mission. Other British astronauts have either secured private funding – such as Helen Sharman, who flew on a Russian rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship, such as Michael Foale and Piers Sellers, who flew missions on the US space shuttle. 'This is a momentous day, not just for Tim Peake but for Great Britain,' he said. 'It is a great sign of our thriving . British space sector, which has seen real growth thanks to our . world-class research, and now supports nearly 30,000 jobs. 'What an achievement that Tim was picked for this historic role from over 8,000 applicants from around the world. 'I am sure he will do us proud and I . hope that he will inspire the next generation to pursue exciting careers . in science and engineering.' Major Peake will carry out a science programme and take part in a European education initiative before and during his mission, and is one of six astronauts selected from more than 8,000 hopefuls. 'It really is a true privilege to be assigned to a long duration mission, it feels like a real high point in a long career in aviation,' he told a news conference at the Science Museum in London. 'I am really grateful to my family, friends and professional colleagues who are supporting me as I prepare for the challenge that lies ahead. 'The mission to the International Space Station is going to be a wonderful opportunity, not just for Europe and European science but the UK as well.' In a jokey reference to David Bowie fan, Commander Chris Hadfield, he said: 'I do play the guitar, but very badly, and I wouldn't inflict my singing on anybody.' Cdr Hadfield, from Canada, was his country's first professional astronaut, and gained a legion of fans on the Soyuz space capsule mission to and from the ISS, by performing a cover of the Bowie classic, Space Oddity. Major Peake praised Cdr Hadfield for the 'fantastic job' he had done. 'I don't think I'll be able to top the tweeting, but I will also be tweeting, to encourage a generation to take an interest in space.'He said it was too early to say what experiments he would be involved in, but there were 'rolling experiments' in different fields on the space station which he expected to continue. These were in fields such as human physiology, medical research into vaccines, fluids physics and astrobiology. He said it was too early to say whether there would be an opportunity for him to do a spacewalk during his tour. Peake was one of six people to be chosen to be trained as astronauts in 2009 .

Hip and bust . dimensions, meanwhile, have grown by only an inch, leaving them just . four inches larger than the waist. As a result, almost half of British . women are now classed as a ‘rectangle’ – with little difference between . bust, waist and hip measurements.

The Mars 3 landing capsule (not actual model), which only transmitted data for 14.5 seconds, may have been re-discovered . Although it is too early to say definitively it is the Mars 3 Lander, stills taken from 2007 appear to have captured the heatshield, retrorocket and parachute of the machine. The pictures were pored over by a group of Russian space fans, led by Vitaliy Egorov, who told Sky & Telescope: 'When I suggested that our group begin searches, 15 or 20 people responded. 'We examined all of the picture but didn't find the lander — enthusiasm quickly died away.' But on New Year's Eve last year, Egorov struck gold, as he finally spotted elements of the Mars 3 Lander. 'I think of it as a gift from Santa Claus or the Russian Father Frost,' he added. Found: This set of images shows what might be hardware from the Soviet Union's 1971 Mars 3 lander, seen in a pair of images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera . Rescue mission: These two marks, although questionable to the naked eye, are believed to be parts of the Soviet Union's failed Mars Lander 3's mission to the Red Planet . The discovery was shared with scientists, who contacted the MRO team in order to take a follow-up shot of the debris, and the high resolution camera confirmed the findings. The layout and the way the fixtures are on the surface seem to acknowledge that it is the Lander, however, further study is being undertaken to understand the 3-dimensional shapes and rule out any other explanation. While the Mars Lander 3 transmitted for less than 15 seconds, it was still better than the Soviet Union's two later efforts. The Mars 6 and the Mars 7 were both launched in 1973, but both failed. The U.S. Viking Lander, which arrived on Mars in 1976, is credited as being the first successful landing on the Red Planet.","Mars 3 Lander transmitted for less than 15 seconds - then disappeared .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:05 EST, 2 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 3 April 2012 . A senior government official resigned Monday after a report concluded her agency improperly paid for an 'over-the-top' training session near Las Vegas that allegedly featured a mind reader, a clown, a comedian, bicycle giveaways and lavish after-hour receptions in resort suites for federal workers. The White House accepted General Services Administration chief Martha Johnson's resignation after she dismissed two deputies and suspended other career federal employees over the $820,000 conference. The 300-person event at the M Resort Spa and Casino in Henderson, Nevada, included $3,200 for a mind reader, $6,300 on commemorative coin sets,  and $75,000 on a training exercise to build a bicycle in 2010. Controversial: The White House accepted General Services Administration chief Martha Johnson's resignation after she dismissed two deputies and suspended other career federal employees over the $820,000 conference . It also included a $95-per-person dinner and reception as well as various violations of federal laws and policies, and costs for a clown and a comedian, according to the Washington Post. 'As the agency Congress has entrusted . with developing the rules followed by other federal agencies for . conferences, GSA has a special responsibility to set an example, and . that did not occur here,' the inspector general concluded in its report. Public Buildings Service chief Robert . Peck and Johnson's top adviser, Stephen Leeds, were forced out. Four . GSA employees who organized the five-day conference for the Public . Buildings Service's western region have been placed on administrative . leave pending further action, a White House official said. The . official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the . embarrassing episode within the federal agency that oversees office . space and supplies, transportation and management tasks. 'On his first day in office, . President Obama made clear that the people who serve in his . administration are keepers of the public trust and that public service . is a privilege,' White House chief of staff Jack Lew said in a . statement. 'He was outraged by the excessive spending, questionable dealings with contractors and disregard for taxpayer dollars. Forced out: Public Buildings Service chief Robert Peck, left, and Johnson's top adviser, Stephen Leeds, right, were fired after the controversy . 'He . called for all those responsible to be held fully accountable given . that these actions were irresponsible and entirely inconsistent with the . expectations that he has set as president.' The planners spent more than $136,000 on a pre-conference visit to Las Vegas, including $57 lunches, according to an internal review first reported by The Washington Post. That report also found 'redundant and wasteful' practices, such as hiring outside event planners when the agency already has in-house workers for those tasks. Those outside planners received a $12,000 commission from the resort, which the investigators said 'strongly indicates that further discounts might have been available to GSA if GSA had contracted the hotel directly.' The report also found costs that exceeded the original projections and officials who skirted federal rules that set aside some contracts for small businesses. The internal review found questionable actions, such as the event planner asking the hotel that an agency employee who arrived a day early get 'a friend of a friend of the owner rate (wink).' Another agency employee sought a discount on a $98 purse from the hotel gift shop. She received a $30 break. The conference also spent $75,000 for a training exercise to assemble 24 bikes that were later donated at the agency's direction to the Boys' and Girls' Club. Any equipment purchased with taxpayer dollars is supposed to be sold during government sales, but planners attempted to skirt those rules by having the trainers claim ownership of the cycles. Luxurious: The M Resort Spa and Casino in Henderson, Nevada, where the 300-person event that included $6,300 on a commemorative coin set, and $75,000 on a training exercise to build a bicycle in 2010, took place . Plush: One of the expensive rooms in the Las Vegas hotel where the five-day conference took place . Planners spent $31,000 on a 'networking reception' that featured a $19-per-person 'American artisanal cheese display' and $7,000 in sushi. Taxpayers also footed the bill for $5,600 for in-room parties, $3,700 for T-shirts and almost $2,800 in water bottles. A separate cocktail reception included $1,500 for 'Boursin scalloped potato with Barolo wine-braised short ribs' and a $525 bartender fee for a cash bar. A senior official spent $2,700 entertaining other employees after the closing dinner. And three officials spent almost $400 for rented tuxedos. All of this occurred during a conference that a regional administrator directed to be '""over the top,"" bigger and better than previous conferences.' Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, called the conference a 'junket'. 'It is never appropriate for an agency to fund lavish conferences that waste tax dollars,' she said. 'This is especially true at a time when American families are struggling to put food on their own tables and the U.S. government is piling up debt at an historic pace.' Johnson seemed to agree. 'I find the information in your report to be very troubling as it outlines potential violations of federal procurement laws and agency policy,' Johnson said in a memo that accompanied the inspector general's report. 'Over the top': Taxpayers footed the bill for a $3,200 session with a mind reader amongst other lavish expenses . Unnecessary: The luxury $800,000 training conference also allegedly featured a clown . The White House found out about the draft internal report in early March, and Lew and White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler investigated the conference for employees of GSA's western region. Obama later was told of the findings and demanded accountability. Johnson put in place new rules to prevent future spending, such as dealings that went around bidding rules, ignored contracting requirements and questionable expenses such as tuxedo rentals - but they were not enough to keep her in her job. 'I fell I must step aside as administrator so that the agency can move forward at this time with a fresh leadership team,' Johnson wrote in her resignation. 'Collectively, the people of GSA now must review, repair and rebuild.' Johnson served as a co-leader for the Obama transition team and previously was a vice president at 90,000-employee Computer Sciences Corporation. During the Clinton administration, she was a White House aide, an official at the Commerce Department and the chief of staff at the General Services Administration.","Total cost of catered food and beverages was $146,527 .

"PUBLISHED: . 00:55 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:08 EST, 7 May 2013 . President Obama’s is on something of a congressional charm offensive as he took part in a bipartisan game of golf on Monday afternoon. Obama, an avid golfer with a respectable 17 handicap, rarely takes politics to the greens. Senators Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.) joined Obama, who usually plays golf with aides or friends from Chicago. On the green: President Barack Obama with Senator Mark Udall, D-Colo. on the golf course at Andrews Air Force Base . Obama, who has the highest handicap in the group, teamed up with Udall, who has the lowest. The president, in a white baseball cap, navy blue zip up jacket and dark khakis, chipped his first shot past the hole. He later missed a putt. They were beaten by Corker and Chambliss, aided by the Georgia senator’s hole in one on the 11th hole on the golf course at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Putting away: US President Barack Obama rarely takes politics onto the greens but The White House say he is determined to do 'whatever it takes' to get his second term agenda through . Chambliss hit a five iron 156 yards for a surprise hole in one on the 11th hole. The feat was the talk of Washington, but the Georgia Republican was modest about the shot. 'It was pretty special. The ball . actually flew the route I wanted it to go,' Chambliss told reporters . back at the Senate, after the game was cut short after 15 holes due to a . vote. 'I'm the luckiest guy in the . world to have a hole in one. Anyone who says having a hole-in-one is . skill, they're living in another world,' he said. 'The . president got it out of the hole and handed it to me, and then they . brought the flag out later. He signed the flag, and everybody signed the . flag, and it was pretty neat,' said Chambliss, who has golfed for 40 . years, and has a 7.4 handicap. 'We . had a delightful day of golf with folks who enjoy playing the game. We . talked some business, but it was mainly a day for everyone to get away . from the office for a little while,' he added. Both Republicans have both expressed some willingness to compromise with Democrats on a deal. Obama . has waged bitter fights with Congress over how best to tame the deficit . and on proposed new gun control laws after December's school shooting . in Newtown, Connecticut. Fair way: US President Barack Obama plays golf with Senators Bob Corker(right), Saxby Chambliss(on left with hat) and Mark Udall (on far left)at Andrews Air Force Base golf course . All smiles: President Barack Obama teams up with a group of bipartisan senators on the first hole of the golf course at Andrews Air Force Base. If only it was as easy in congress... But the president has also been criticized for failing to work more closely with the Senate and House of Representatives. He has responded in recent months by hosting dinners and lunches with . small groups of lawmakers from both parties to try to find common ground . on issues. Chambliss said . the foursome did not discuss immigration reform, a top priority for . Obama, which begins to wind its way through Congress this week. Chambliss said the foursome talked 'a little bit' about the crisis in Syria, cybersecurity and fiscal issues. Lucky guy: Senator Saxby Chambliss smiles as he talks to reporters about making a hole-in-one during a golf outing earlier in the day with President Barack Obama . Obama has golf diplomacy before and in 2011 he played with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Obama . almost never golfs with members of Congress.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . PUBLISHED: . 17:43 EST, 22 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:56 EST, 22 May 2013 . The sole adult afflicted by a mystery Tourette's-like illness that swept the small town of Le Roy, New York, in late 2011 has told how her body 'hurt' and her head would become locked to one side. Marge Fitzsimmons, 36, joined eighteen high school students who were suddenly struck down by terrifying, undiagnosable symptoms which included severe twitching and shouting episodes. Speaking for the first time since her recovery in a new documentary titled The Town That Caught Tourette's, airing tonight on TLC at 10pm ET/PT, Ms Fitzsimmons states: 'Everyone kept on referring to, ""it's only affecting teenagers"", and it wasn't.' Scroll down for video . Shaken: Marge Fitzsimmons was the only adult gripped by a mystery Tourette's-like syndrome that swept the small town of Le Roy, New York, in late 2011 . In a preview clip for the hour-long program the nurse practitioner explains how, in a state of panic, she consulted medics who concluded that her stress levels were sky-high. 'My doctor said ""Everything that you've ever suppressed in your whole life has just erupted like a volcano."" In October 2011 she started experiencing sudden head jerks followed by vocal tics. At one point she decided to leave work early in fear of losing her job. Recalling her deteriorating condition, Ms Fitzsimmons says: 'If anybody touched me it would hurt . even more. So I couldn't be touched. 'My head it actually stuck right . here . . .My chin was on the back side of my shoulder.' 'My head it actually stuck . . . My chin was on the back side of my shoulder' When news of the bizarre outbreak first surfaced it was thought to be caused by a condition prevalent in children, as all of the cases involved students from Le Roy High School. However, when details of Ms Fitzsimmons' situation emerged researchers had to come up with a new theory. As time went on and no direct cause or cure was . identified, worry turned to fear, panic and suspicion, particularly as . the wider world began to show an interest. And the new footage highlights this terror. 'I don't understand it - something is not right,' one parent tells the camera. Another suggests drugs may be involved, adding: 'It's either completely unrelated or they've all gotten into something.' Debilitating: Ms Fitzsimmons said that her head would become locked 'on the back side of my shoulder' One of the younger sufferers is seen insisting: 'Seriously, why would we fake this?' The TLC film examines the various speculated causes of the . Tourette's-like tics, as well as the rising fear that something serious . was being covered up. 'There might be some sort of cover up,' one man is heard suggesting. 'Whatever it is, it may be spreading.' Another says: 'Please, just tell us what this is and where it came from and how we can get rid of it.'And . a woman's voice is full of frustration as she tells the camera: 'Stop . lying to me and just tell me you don't know what the hell's going on!' In total, 19 patients came forward with Tourette’s like symptoms, which include uncontrollable facial and body twitching. 'Electric shock feeling': One young girl clutches onto the sides of a hospital bed as she convulses . Distressing symptoms: Another sufferer can be seen in a hospital bed twitching as she awaits diagnosis . At one point in the TLC program one patient is heard saying between tics:  'The electrical shock feeling that I get in my spine never goes away.' Another, also visibly affected, says: 'I was always so active . . . I don't feel like myself . . . anymore. The . true cause of the illness is still a mystery, but the documentary . explores different possible causes such as infections, environmental . influences, conversion disorder and even Lyme disease. Among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich, best known as the woman portrayed by Julia Roberts in the eponymous 2000 movie. She . has suggested that a chemical spill from a train derailment in the . 1970s near the site of the girls’ school may be the cause. But . doctors who have treated or tested the girls in Le Roy believe they are . suffering from conversion disorder, or the twitching symptoms are . possibly related to an infection. Tourette's-like symptoms: The teenagers affected . by the bizarre tics speak of their distress in the documentary, . describing how their lives have changed . Mystery condition: All exhibit frequent . twitches, some more extreme than others, as they speak. One girl says: . 'I feel like people look at me and judge me' More recently, Facebook and YouTube were being blamed for the mystery illness. Doctors . said that symptoms are being ‘reinforced and magnified’ because victims . of the bizarre condition are uploading videos of themselves onto social . networking sites to appeal for help. They . argue that when other people in the town of Le Roy view the videos, they . are unconsciously mimicking what they see and spreading it around. David . Lichter, professor of neurology at the University of Buffalo, who has . treated several of the patients, told MSNBC: 'It's remarkable to see how . one individual posts something, and then the next person who posts . something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with . known movement disorders, but it's the same kind of movements. 'This mimicry goes on with Facebook or YouTube exposure. This is the modern way that symptomology could be spread.’ School scandal: Eighteen Le Roy High School students reported a mysterious outbreak of spasms and seizures . Researchers . have also come up with a string of theories and believe teenagers may . have been struck down by pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric . syndrome, or PANS, which is a kind of OCD linked to strep throat. Other believe that Morgellons could be to blame, which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores. Some . doctors have also suggested it could be a mass psychogenic illness . which can be triggered by stress and is spread from unconscious mimicry . of one another. Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, chief of neurology at the Dent Neurologic Institute in . Buffalo, said: 'When one has a symptom, it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals with similar symptoms. 'That's . what's going on with these girls. They are in a segregated small rural . town in New York state. They are a cohesive group. And this wildfire of . symptoms takes control.' Local hazard: Environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich has suggested that a chemical spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls' school may be the cause . During . an angry meeting with school officials in February 2012, parents asked . why the soil around a natural gas well which had been dug on school . ground had not been tested for contamination. 'This . could take years! What are you doing to protect my kid? What are you . doing to protect these peoples kids?' said parent Patrick Frauley. 'I'm not looking for a lawsuit of any kind, I just want my daughter to get better,' said Beth Miller. Adding . to the concern was that the wells were drilled using the controversial . hydraulic fracturing method, also known as ‘fracking’. Dr . Greg Young of the New York State Department of Health had earlier . explained that tests had ruled out environmental factors as the cause of . the disease. He also claimed that genetics, antihistamines or head trauma could be to blame.","In TLC's new documentary The Town That Caught Tourette's locals talk about their fear, panic and suspicion after undiagnosable illness struck the town of Le Roy, New York, in late 2011 ."

The Diadem was designed and made for George IV to wear at his coronation in 1821 by the royal jewellers and goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge and Rundell. The Diadem is one of the most recognisable of The Queen's jewels, as she is shown wearing it on postage stamps and some issues of banknotes. Also on display will be the diamond Coronation Necklace and Earrings, made for Queen Victoria in 1858 by R & S Garrard & Co. and worn by Her Majesty The Queen for her Coronation. As they tour the State Rooms, visitors will experience a sense of the atmosphere of Coronation Day and learn how individual rooms were used in 1953. For example, it was in the Green Drawing Room that Cecil Beaton (1904-80) took his famous Coronation portraits of The Queen, using his signature theatrical backdrops to recreate the inside of Westminster Abbey. Other official portraits were taken in the Throne Room. The Coronation State Banquets were held on the evenings of 3 and 4 June 1953, and for the Summer Opening of the Palace, the table in the State Dining Room will be dressed to evoke the Banquets' magnificent settings of porcelain, silver-gilt and flowers. Along the visitor route will be works of art and paintings linked to the occasion, including the Coronation Frieze (1960) by Feliks Topolski (1909-89), who was commissioned to record the colour and excitement of the event, and Queen Elizabeth II in Coronation Robes (1954), the State portrait by Sir Herbert James Gunn (1893-1964).

Another case of bird flu in a Beijing child who displayed no symptoms is causing more confusion for doctors, health officials have admitted. The 4-year-old boy tested positive for H7N9 after he was in a group of people who had contact with a 7-year-old girl confirmed as the Chinese capital’s first case of the deadly virus over the weekend.

Not guilty: Father John Taylor, of Margate, Kent, met his accuser on Facebook and went on a dinner date which ended in sex . A priest has been cleared of raping a woman who made up the allegation based on the violent books of popular crime writer Martina Cole. Father John Taylor, 48, of Margate, Kent, found himself in a nightmare situation after meeting his accuser on Facebook and going on a dinner date which ended in sex. The woman, in her late 20s,  reported him for rape and he lost his job, found himself shunned by parishioners, and had his car vandalised three times, Canterbury Crown Court was told. He was also banned from seeing his two young children who live with his ex-wife Zsanett, 34, in her native Hungary because of the allegation. Father Taylor was due to stand trial for rape on Monday but the case collapsed minutes before it was due to start. The court heard the woman told police that she identified with characters in the novels by Cole which feature violent rape. The most recent book she had read was The Ladykiller, which tells of a victim being raped by a man who grabs her hair with one hand and undresses her with the other. The woman, in her late 20s, had accused Father Taylor of a similar attack. Other novels by Cole also portray priests as abusers. The woman told police the Catholic priest had pinned her on his sofa and forced her to have sex - but DNA evidence proved she had never been on the couch. Author: The court heard the woman told police she identified with characters in the novels by Martina Cole (pictured) which feature violent rape . The Crown Prosecution Service said it was offering no evidence against Father Taylor and he was formally found not guilty of rape. Prosecutor Christopher May said: ‘The forensic evidence undermines the prosecution case and therefore the Crown offers no evidence.’ Crime story: The most recent book she had read was The Ladykiller, which tells of a victim being raped . Jonathan Simpson, defending, told the court: ‘She said in her statement that she identified with the characters in the novels by Martina Cole. They all feature violent rapes.’ After being cleared, a relieved Father Taylor said: ‘I met her on Facebook and I thought we were just going on a normal date. Yes we had sex, but it was consensual. ‘Two days later I was arrested and accused of rape. I think there are three possible reasons why she accused me. One is that she already had a boyfriend. Another is that she thought she would get thousands of pounds of compensation from the church. ‘Or the third that she was worried that she had told me too much private information about her family that she didn't want to get out. ‘She wrote in her police statements that she had read the Martina Cole books. I think the sick story lines got in her head and she used them to base her made-up story on.’ ‘This is the worst crime a man can be accused of because you are automatically prejudged. This has done my health in for 14 months just waiting. I have put on weight and even gone grey.’ Father Taylor, a community priest in Thanet, Kent, and chaplain at Margate Magistrates' Court, said he hoped to return soon to his charity work. He added that he was now planning legal action against the woman, saying: ‘As the person being accused your life is over. 'People cannot just make stories up like that. She has to face up to what she has done. I want the police to take action against her for wasting officers' and the court's time.’","Father John Taylor, 48, met his accuser on Facebook and went on a date .

Three people on the plane that landed on a fairway had minor injuries as stunned golfers looked on. Rescuers searched for survivors from the fiery crash. Scroll down for video... Hole in one: The pilot of this plane heroically managed to land it on the green of Westlake Village golf course . Two crashes: Two very different outcomes with one landing gently on a fairway and the other smashing into mountains . The plane that crashed was on an engine test flight, but authorities did not know how many people were onboard at the time of the crash. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said a preliminary review of radar records showed the two flight-paths crossed just after 2 p.m. A single-engine Cessna 172 carrying three people was flying west at an altitude of 3,500 feet when the second plane, also a Cessna 172, approached from the east after leaving Santa Monica Airport for a test flight. The flights merged approximately 8 miles east northeast of Ventura, CA according to FAA radar data, Kenitzer said. Reliable: The popular single-engined Cessna 172 . Both planes appeared to have hit the ground within minutes of each other and about 10 miles apart.The National Transportation Safety Board and FAA are investigating. Shortly after 2 p.m., firefighters responding to a report of a small wildfire spotted aircraft debris on the charred site. Los Angeles County Fire Department Inspector Quvondo Johnson said ground crews later confirmed that a small plane had crashed. The body of the pilot was sighted on Monday evening in the crash area in rugged terrain near Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes Road, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

Rescue crews have 'identified the wreckage of a single-seat airplane with a single occupant who appears to be deceased,' said Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore. The plane that crashed into the mountains sparked a fire that was quickly put out after burning about an acre of dry brush, officials said. In the Westlake Village incident, the Cessna ended up in the middle of the third fairway. KNBC-TV broadcast footage of the second plane sitting on the golf course in Westlake Village. The landing gear was not visible. Minor injuries: Three people on the cessna were taken to hospital . Investigation: The NTSB is now trying to find out what caused the crash on a clear cloudless California day . FAA records show the plane on the golf course is a four-seat Cessna 172 Skyhawk manufactured in 1980. It's registered to Ameriflyers of Florida, LLC. A message left at a number listed for the company was not immediately returned. Aaron Jesse, 47, said he had left work early to play golf with friends and saw the low-flying plane hit a tree, spin around 180 degrees and land surprisingly gently. 'Finally being a bad golfer paid off,' Jesse told the Los Angeles Times. 'I hit it in the trees to the right. They landed 50 feet to the left of us in the center of the fairway. All we heard was a thud and then he made a gentle bounce and slid down the center of the fairway.'","Planes crashed at 2pm on a cloudless California day .

Door staff became suspicious when the plonker showed them a driving licence bearing the name of the Only Fools And Horses character and his address - 23 Nelson Mandela House. It also featured a photograph of Rodney actor Nicholas Lyndhurst and date of birth 26 February 1960. The drunken youngster turned up at the pub in Newquay on Saturday night and claimed to be 24 when the age on the Rodney ID would have made him 52. Cosmic: The underage drinker tried to enter a pub in Newquay with a fake driving licence belonging to one Rodney Charlton Trotter . A manager of the Newquay Arms, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was there when he turned up. 'He was a bit drunk, he handed over the ID and I looked at it and then scanned it to double check it was fake and then I noticed the picture. 'It had Rodney Trotter’s picture and I said to him ""so this is you?"" and he just said ""yeah yeah yeah"". 'Then I asked him his date of birth and he said it. Then I told him it didn’t match the one that was on the ID. 'I made the doormen UV the ID just to wind him up really and they started giggling and playing along with him.' Not having it: Door staff at the Newquay Arms in Newquay, Cornwall, were even more bemused when the drunk youngster got his date of birth wrong . The fake ID - which can be bought online as a novelty item for £2.99 - was signed off with the name 'Cosmic'. The pub manager added: 'We kept asking if it was him and what his date of birth was, we even asked his star sign before asking him about his signature, which was ‘Cosmic’. 'I haven’t ever seen a celebrity ID trying to be used before, but the worst case we have had was probably when a white man tried to use his friend's ID, who was clearly African American and said he had ""been on holiday"".' The card was confiscated and police were called but the man left the scene by the time officers arrived. Local police Inspector Ian Drummond-Smith said the fake ID could have landed him in jail. He said: 'Lucky for him he’d left before police arrived, as possessing a forged driving licence can attract two years’ imprisonment. The real Rodney: Nicholas Lyndhurst, left, and Sir David Jason, right, starred in the long running BBC series Only Fools and Horses . 'We have seized 13 forged IDs so far this season but even we saw the funny side of this one. I don’t think it would ever have worked.' Newquay is plagued by underage drinkers and ID scanners have been brought in to tighten up door entrance policies. Inspector Drummond-Smith said: 'So far this season we have returned 42 driving licenses or passports to the DVLA or Passport Office. 'If you lend someone your ID, the door staff will retain it and we will send it back. Passports remain the property of HM Government and if misused will always be returned. 'This caused a major problem for a woman last week who is due to fly out on holiday in three weeks’ time.

The 24-year-old told MailOnline she stood . out growing up in Leyton, east London, with her unique sense of style . and home-made headbands. But now the 24-year-old is making waves in the fashion world after setting up her own clothing line, Loud Culture, with friend Abi Fashesin. Fashion entrepreneur: Ashley-Rae Tapping has set up her own clothing line with Abi Fashesin . Fan: Diana Vickers wore a boob tube from the Loud Culture 2011 collection in More magazine . The pair met at college, where Ashley-Rae was studying PR and journalism and Abi was a fashion student, and after launching their spring/summer 2011 then 2012 collections, Loud Culture already has a number of celeb fans. Little Mix have worn items in photo shoots, while Diana Vickers has appeared on magazine covers in their clothes. Another X Factor finalist, Misha B, . has performed in their designs, as have girl band Stooshe. Ashley-Rae said it 'feels great' to . see stars in their designs. 'We didn't think anyone would take notice of . us, so it's a dream come true to see stars like Little Mix in our . clothes. It makes us even more determined.' Ashley-Rae describes their clothing as 'fun and edgy', combining bold African-inspired prints with contemporary tailoring. Exposure: Diana Vickers also wore a leotard from the brand on the magazine cover . 'We're both of African descent so wanted to wear clothing that reflects that,' she said. 'However, a lot of the clothing in African print is very baggy, and we wanted something more fitting and fun. After we left college, we both knew we wanted to work in fashion, so we thought why not set up our own clothing line?' The pair combined their savings, meaning they had £5,000 to get their business off ground. Ashley-Rae, whose mother is a seamstress and father a businessman, explained: 'I come from a hard-working family and my parents always taught me to work hard if I wanted to get what I wanted. 'While I was a student I juggled two or three jobs - at hairdressers, call centres and clothes shops - I saved as much as I could because I always dreamed of one day being my own boss. 'As we didn't have much money to start with, we got our friends and family involved as much as possible, web designers we knew offered to do our website for free, and friends modelled the clothes.' They now sell their creations through their online store at competitive high street prices, and last year made £10,000. Got the X factor: Ashley-Rae said it feels great to see stars in their clothes, like Little Mix's Leigh Anne, pictured second from right, in a Loud Culture top . Loud Culture's success so far has been down to Ashley-Rae and Abi's dedication to getting themselves noticed - largely by using social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter. They contacted fashion bloggers, celebrity stylists, photographers and models to get their clothing on the fashion radar. Ashley-Rae said: 'It was all about being persistent and knocking on as many doors as we could. We believed in our brand and although we had nothing but knock-backs to begin with, we've now proved that passion and persistence do pay off.' Their enterprising efforts were also noticed by Richard Branson, and they are now members of his Virgin Media Pioneers, an initiative he set up to support young entrepreneurs. Ashley-Rae said the initiative offers them support and motivation to believe 'anything is possible'. Fun and edgy designs: Girl band Stooshe pictured performing in outfits from the 2012 collection . The enterprising designer has had further successes as a celebrity fashion guru, as through contacts she has made through Loud Culture she has now become a stylist to pop star Chipmunk. On top of this role she and Abi are continuing to expand Loud Culture, adding new lines to their collection and continuing to think big. 'We would love one day to see Rihanna or Beyonce in our clothes,' Ashley-Rae said.

A police officer was killed and four others seriously injured when two helicopters crashed into each other during a riot training exercise above Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Both vehicles were reduced to fiery hulks when they smashed into a field adjoining the stadium during a snowstorm.  Reports suggest that the vehicles flew too close to one another while one was descending and their rotors clashed. The helicopters, thought to be carrying up to 25 police officers each, were taking part in a training exercise dealing with football violence and crowd control. Scroll down for video . Devastation: Two crashed helicopters on the field of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin . Response: Police officers rush to the scene after the crash in which one police officer died and another four were seriously injured . Football ground: The Olympic Stadium in Berlin is also home to the Hertha Berlin Bundesliga football club . Exercise: The two helicopters can be seen lying beside each other. The officers are believed to have been taking part in a football violence and crowd control exercise . The Olympic Stadium, which is now home to the Hertha Berlin Bundesliga football club, was the focal point of the Olympic Games in 1936, dubbed Hitler's Games. It also hosted the World Cup final in 2006. Fireworks were reportedly being let off to create riot conditions when the collision occurred.  One pilot was pictured walking away from the wreckage of his craft with blood streaming down his face from a head wound. As well as the serious injuries and fatality, media reports spoke of 'many others' being hurt. The crash between the Puma helicopters happened at 10.40am this morning. Some 400 police officers were on the ground and dashed to the nearby fields to help their stricken comrades when they saw the aircraft go down in flames. Reports suggest that the crash happened when one helicopter was preparing to land and . did not notice the other beneath it. The machines were no more than . 100 feet off the ground when they collided, while it is understood that the dead pilot . was at the controls of the lower aircraft. Alex Lier, a reporter for the Bild newspaper who was at the scene, said: 'Everyone is in shock. Three helicopters were airborne in a real snowstorm. 'Then one heard a loud bang and someone shouted: 'Everyone get down!' There was blood and wreckage everywhere.' The helicopters are part of a fleet operated by the Federal Police - the national force - as opposed to the local Berlin police.  An immediate inquiry is underway into the cause of the crash as local hospitals deal with the casualties. One of the helicopter pilots died at . the scene, fire service spokesman Stephan Fleischer said, who confirmed . that five people were injured, four of them seriously. A female police officer is among the four severely wounded in the crash. Disaster: There were 25 police officers in each of the Puma helicopters, with reports suggesting they flew too close to each other . Injuries: One of the injured officers is helped away from the scene. Reports suggested that 'many more' had been injured . Federal Police spokesman Frank . Brochert confirmed there 'was an incident during an exercise' and that . emergency crews were on the scene. He had no details about the accident. Fire . service spokesman Sven Gerling said his initial information was that . two helicopters crashed, but he had no further details on the accident. It was not immediately clear whether the injured people were in the helicopters, Mr Fleischer said. Pictures from the scene showed one of . the helicopters lying on its side in the snow in a field behind the . stadium and the other next to it, still upright. Eyewitness Johannes Malinowski said . on n-tv television that he saw three helicopters approaching and that . the snow on the field was being kicked up by the aircraft, so 'you . couldn't see a whole lot anymore'. There was then 'a big bang' he said, 'and then we looked up and there was blood on the ground'. The training exercise being conducted was thought to have related to football violence. Germany's main police union is calling for clarification why the training exercise was green-lighted when the weather was so bad in Berlin. The president of the GdP union said: 'We need answers.  But immediately our sympathies and concern lie with the survivors and for the family of the dead officer.  We wish a speedy and full recovery to our injured colleagues.' The Olympic Stadium in West Berlin was constructed in 1936 . Training: There are thought to have been a further 400 officers from the Federal Police on the ground during the exercise . Confusion: Fireworks had been let off inside the stadium to recreate the atmosphere of a riot, according to some reports . Wreckage: Eyewitness Johannes Malinowski said on n-tv television that he saw three helicopters approaching and that the snow on the field was being kicked up by the aircraft, so 'you couldn't see a whole lot anymore' Major stadium: A view from inside the stadium taken during the 2006 FIFA World Cup . The design and construction of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin was overseen by Nazi ruler Adolf Hitler, which was the focal point of the Olympic Games in 1936. German athletes won more gold medals than any other nation at the tournament, prompting Hitler to say that when the war was won, every Olympic Games would take place in Germany. After the Games Hitler told Albert Speer, an architect and later his Armaments Minister who worked on the original stadium, . to produce blueprints for a new stadium seating 400,000 people. Despite its modern remodelling, including a roof and moveable . seating, the stadium is recognisably the same as that which hosted the 1936 Games. The Games represented the one arena in which Hitler's ambition to . rule victorious over the rest of the civilised world would actually be . accomplished, albeit only in the world of athletics. The stadium is the biggest and best-preserved example of Nazi . architecture in Berlin, and was built as an expression of German might. Hitler opened the Games on August 1, 1936, between two tall, imposing . stone towers which look like fortified turrets, with the five rings of . the Olympic symbol strung between them. That summer's day, conscious that he cut a rather sorry figure in . civilian dress, Hitler wore his usual brown uniform with a peaked cap, . baggy trousers, knee-length leather boots and swastika armband. Show of strength: A Hitler Youth meeting in the Olympic Stadium, Berlin, designed for the 1936 Games . He walked beneath a 220ft-high stone belltower, its . nine-and-a-half-ton bell inscribed, in Gothic letters, 'I call to the . Youth of the World'. A special truck had pulled it slowly across Germany to Berlin, . greeted throughout its journey with military parades, bands and . speeches. As Hitler marched slowly between the Olympic teams gathered just . outside on the vast open space of the May Field, he was filmed by the . camera teams of his favourite director, Leni Riefenstahl. From three miles away, loudspeakers positioned along his route had been intoning: 'He is coming. He is coming.' When he entered the stadium and ascended to the Ehrentribune, or seat . of honour, Hitler was greeted by a sea of swastikas and a thunderous . roar of adulation from the capacity crowd of  110,000 people. As the national teams marched past, the French were greeted with a . huge ovation for giving the Nazi salute, while the British, who refused . to give the salute, performing instead a military-style 'eyes right', . were received almost in silence. Despite the existence of concentration camps and brutal treatement of . Jews in Germany, with the exception of Stalin's Russia, who were not . invited, none of the Olympic teams chose to boycott Hitler's Games. A few individual athletes pulled out, but the prevailing sentiment . was summed up by the British gold medallist sprinter Harold Abrahams, . himself Jewish, who said: 'If the British team goes to Berlin, it will . be an influence for the good.' his was despite the fact that, since 1933, Jewish sportsmen and women . had been largely excluded from competing, except among themselves. Under pressure from the International Olympic Committee, the Germans . unwillingly allowed a couple of Jews, both women, to train for the . Olympics, though only one was permitted to participate.","The two Puma helicopters were taking part in a training exercise above Berlin's Olympic Stadium .

Trevor Hannington has been jailed for harassing a woman who provided a witness statement against him . A Nazi thug dubbed 'The Fist' has been jailed for posting abusive messages about the woman who 'grassed him up' to police. Hitler-loving alcoholic Trevor Hannington, 61, from Treherbert, South Wales, was due to face trial for offences under the Terrorism Act when former friend Lindsay Seagrim-Trinder gave a witness statement against him. However, he pleaded guilty so she was never called to court to testify against him. To get revenge, Hannington went on to publish her name, address, contact details and photograph online, branding her a 'grass'. Mrs Seagrim-Trinder and her husband, Alistair, met Hannington on a nostalgia website in 2003 before meeting in person once they discovered they all live in South Wales. Mrs Seagrim-Trinder did not agree with Hannington's political views or idolisation of Adolf Hitler, but they remained friends on the understanding that views on both subjects would not be discussed. However, Hannington posted a blog celebrating what would have been Hitler's 120th birthday in 2009 and that is when the friendship broke down. Later that year, police contacted Mrs Seagrim-Trinder to speak to her about an investigation into terrorist activities involving Hannington. He and a friend, part of . far-right extremist group Aryan Strike Force, left comments online . describing Jews as 'scum' and calling for them to be 'destroyed'. Hannington was later convicted of . stirring up racial hatred and distributing terrorist publications at . Liverpool Crown Court. He was sentenced to two years. She later felt guilty for helping police and after he was jailed at Belmarsh prison she agreed to house him when he was released. Nazi flags adorned Hannington's front room in Treherbert, South Wales . Prosecutor Rachel Knight said: 'She felt an amount of guilty because she provided a statement and did not want to kick him whilst he was down, so she gave him a second chance.' But after he was out of jail, he . posted Mrs Seagrim Trinder's details online leaving her frightened of revenge . attacks from his fellow fascists. Hannington, of Treherbert, South . Wales, admitted harassment. He was jailed for 12 months and given a 12 . month restraining order banning him from contacting Mrs Seagrim-Trinder. Judge Christopher Llewellyn-Jones QC jailed Hannington said: 'You felt resentful towards her.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 08:14 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:49 EST, 29 April 2013 . The American phenomenon of throwing proms for teen school leavers is now commonplace in the UK. But it's no longer just those moving on from sixth form getting the red carpet treatment. British children as young as four are now having proms of their own to mark the auspicious occasion of leaving their nursery to go to 'big' school. The occasion involves little girls dressing up in ball gowns complete with corsages while the boys wear black tie or tuxedos and some are even transported to the event in limos. Too much too young? Nursery age children are now getting dressed up to attend their own proms (posed by models) High Street store Debenhams have capitialised on the demand with a range of prom dresses for four-year-olds. Their March/April magazine showcases some of the garments that will be in store with dresses for 'little ladies' - including those by designers Jenny Packham and John Rocha - and suits for 'miniature gents'. Busy Bees nursery in Lemington Spa is one of the nurseries up and down the country who have thrown a prom for toddlers. On their website, accompanied by a picture of children dressed up in suits and party dresses, they write: 'This year we celebrated in style with a fire engine limo! The children were able to take part in using the real fire hoses to spray water. Mr Mayhem once again joined us with his fun disco and party games.' Belles of the ball: Debenhams have a range of occasion dresses for girls as young as four . But while some nurseries may see the prom as an innocent pastime creating an opportunity for children to dress up like princesses and princes and have a party, some parents and experts are alarmed by the idea. Lisa Eliot, author of Pink Brain, Blue Brain, told The Times she concerned by the way proms reinforce gender stereotypes at such a young age. She said: 'Dressing like a prom queen is not a healthy pastime for young children, in my opinion... by making kids dress according to the extreme of gender apparel, we are telling them that whether they are a boy or girl is their most important feature.' 'Dressing like a prom queen is not a healthy pastime for young children' Meanwhile, Sue Palmer, a former head teacher and author of 21st Century Girls, told the newspaper she 'takes issue' with the nursery proms because she 'believes children should be making mud pies and not squeezing into sequins until at least puberty.' Many parents will agree with her point that a prom where toddlers pull up in a limo dressed to the nines to be greeted by photographers is too much, too young. And it's not just the emotional cost that may concern them but the financial cost too. A prom dress from Debenhams' children's range starts at £45. But competitive mothers may decide to forgo the High Street for designers pushing the price into the hundreds. Then there's the additional costs of shoes, handbags, transport and photographers. Another concern for parents is if they set the bar high for their child's nursery prom, they will have to continue paying out as their child then attends a primary then secondary school prom. Julie Tinson, who carried out research on proms at the University of Stirling, found that 90 per cent of secondary schools in Scotland have a prom now in favour of a school disco with parents spending £400 on average. 'As a ritual in itself, it's not too concerning, but it's more about excess of consumption. If we're doing this at nursery, the expected spend accelerates considerably as the child gets older. What are they going to expect by the time they are at secondary?' she said in The Times. Import: American films such as High School Musical have increased the demand for school proms in the UK . It seems Debenhams already have the answer to her question. In 2011 'prom season' they saw a 57 per cent rise in sales of occasion handbags and a 1,322 per cent sales increase on false lashes. Debenhams spokesperson Carie Barkhuizen said: 'Dancing at the school disco seems to have had its day. All the focus is now on the prom and being the bell of the ball.' As a result the British brand has also seen an increase in demand from under 18s for their personal shopping service where an expert advises them on style and accessorising. Whether this service will soon be in demand from four-year-olds remains to be seen.","British nurseries throwing proms for children leaving for primary school .

As far as celebrity feuds go, it seems Kelly Brook and Katie Price's is set to continue a while longer. Glamour model Katie has now upped the spat by warning Kelly that her boyfriend Danny Cipriani will never be faithful to her. Price, also known as Jordan, reignited her bitter war of words with the TV presenter, 33, on Twitter on Tuesday night, claiming the rugby star is always trying to contact her, days after Kelly mocked her recent marriage to Kieran Hayler on Celebrity Juice. It's war! Katie Price, pictured in Shoreditch on . Saturday, and Kelly Brook, pictured in London last week, have reignited . their war of words . The 35-year-old mother-of-three lashed out at Kelly, writing: '@IAMKELLYBROOK pick up the phone if you hav a prob instead of hiding behind a tv screen to bully me! '@IAMKELLYBROOK ask danny about his emails & texes sent to me behind your back which ill show you kieran agrees he will never be faithful.' Katie's comments come after Kelly made fun of her third marriage on Celebrity Juice on Thursday, when host Keith Lemon asked the panel: 'What did Katie Price do for her husband on their wedding day?' Claws out: Kelly Brook has started to ignore Katie Price's tweets, but the glamour model has warned Danny Cipriani will 'never be faithful' to her . Kelly replied: 'Did she burn my calendar hanging on his wall?' When a fan tweeted Katie about the joke, she replied: 'I'm sure kelly wouldn't be laughing if I said the things Danny Cip said to me about her in the bedroom when I was with him hahaha (sic).' Kelly then hit back and implied that she was still in touch with Danny, when he briefly dated Katie in October 2011, despite living with then-boyfriend Thom Evans at the time. She wrote: 'No but I did laugh when he turned up at my house driving your car the next day ;) I don't think you know anything.' On Tuesday night, Katie thanked Kelly for confirming that Danny had driven her car 'without a license and insurance'. It's all kicking off: The two women started battling on Twitter after Celebrity Juice . She then teased fans that she would reveal all about her brief fling with the rugby player in her upcoming autobiography. But Brook has been ignoring Katie's last comments, instead choosing to post pictures of her holiday with Danny instead. The models have been embroiled in a bitter feud since Kelly reunited with Danny in February and Katie called her a 'heffer'. She . added: 'Rumour has it she's been hanging out with our mutual ex Danny . Cipriani. Knowing him, I guess she's probably been doing a bit of . comfort eating.' Kelly and Katie seemed to have reached a ceasefire recently after weeks of trading barbs. However, the rift between the two models is back on and seems to have reached a new level after the latest bout of tweets started over the weekend. The row was fired up again on Thursday night on Kelly's last episode of Celebrity Juice, when she mocked Katie's recent marriage to Kieran Hayler. Naughty: Kelly couldn't resist another dig at Katie on her last episode of Celebrity Juice last Thursday . When someone tweeted Katie telling her she was being 'mugged off hard', she responded: 'I'm flattered she must be obsessed with me as has to keep mentioning me.' When one Twitter user included Kelly . and Katie's handles in her message, it ended up creating an online . dialogue between the rivals. On Friday night, Katie initially refrained from replying to Kelly's comment directly, she did retweet a comment from a follower suggesting Kelly should keep quiet. The tweet, by @TysonPrice4 read: '@IAMKELLYBROOK Why don't you leave @MissKatiePrice name out of you're mouth u stupid b**ch !!!' Katie briefly dated Danny in October 2011, (during a break from ex-fiance Leandro Penna) who has since reunited with Kelly in February this year. Unimpressed: Katie retweeted an offensive comment about Kelly . Kelly and Danny originally dated from 2008 until 2010, before she went on to have a two year romance with his former Wasps teammate Thom Evans. However, Kelly returned to her ex just weeks after splitting from Thom in January 2013. The row between Katie and Kelly kicked off in February this year, when the former accused the brunette model of looking heavier after seeing photos of her shooting her New Look swimwear campaign in Miami. She wrote her column in The Sun: 'The pictures of Kelly modelling her latest New Look swimwear range in Miami don't seem to be airbrushed and I'm FLABbergasted to see how big Kelly really is. 'You're a heffer (sic), Kelly, but still a hot one.' She even suggested Kelly was 'comfort eating' because she was seeing her ex-boyfriend Danny again. Soon after, Kelly responded, accusing the mother-of-three of being 'rude'. Shared history: Kelly is now dating her ex-boyfriend Danny Cipriani again, who briefly dated Katie in October 2011 . She said: 'I actually wish her all the best. It's sad isn't it? I think it's a bit sad... 'I think girls can get away with having a bit of meat on our bones; I don’t mind a wobbly arm or a bit of cellulite.' However, a few days later, Kelly couldn't resist making a pop of Katie on Celebrity Juice, when she compared her to the character Magda from the hit movie There's Something About Mary. When asked by host Keith Lemon what she would do if Katie was there, she replied: 'What, Magda from There's Something About Mary?' Magda was the fiftysomething, sun-worshipping next door neighbour of Cameron Diaz's character Mary in the hit 1998 comedy. Fling: Katie and Danny at Thorpe Park in Surrey in October 2011 during their brief romance . Played by actress Lin Shaye, she was known for her bleached blonde hair, permatan and caked on make-up... not unlike Katie. That fired up Katie even more, who . posted a zoomed-in photo of Kelly's naked breasts, which had been taken . on holiday in St Barts in 2008. However, Kelly responded with another dig a few weeks later on the ITV2 show, when she played a game where an image of Katie's swimsuit-clad figure had been projected over her. Unaware of Katie's body being projected across the green screen she had stuck her head through, Kelly eventually realised who she was supposed to be and asked: 'Do I talk a lot of s**t?'","Kelly reignited feud when she mocked Katie's recent marriage to Kieran Hayler .

In an image obtained by Buzzfeed of the back of the newest Victoria's Secret catalog, the model, 20, is seen wearing a black Body by Victoria bra. It comes as some surprise to see her posing for the brand, given that she was the subject of some scathing comments from its model booker, Sophia Neophitou, in a New York Times interview early last year. Surprise appearance: In an image of the back of the new Victoria's Secret catalog, Kate Upton is seen posing in a black bra. It comes just over a year after the lingerie giant's casting director called her look 'too obvious' Ms Neophitou told the paper that she would never book Miss Upton for the Victoria's Secret catwalk show. 'She is too obvious. She’s like a page three girl.' she said. 'She’s like a footballer’s wife, with the too-blond hair and the kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.' Ms Neophitou appears to be alone in her opinion of Miss Upton though. The model, who shot to fame after landing the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2012, has become the darling of the fashion set.

Suspected fraud: Author Hanif Kureishi has lost £120,000 in a property investment recommended by his then accountant . Bestselling author Hanif Kureishi has lost his £120,000 life savings after falling victim to an alleged investment fraud. Kureishi, best known for his novel The Buddha Of Suburbia and the screenplay for the hit film My Beautiful Laundrette, last night spoke of his ‘hellish’ experience and claimed that other well-known authors may also have been caught up in the same alleged scam. ‘There have been sleepless nights and a genuine feeling of helplessness,’ said the father of three. ‘This money was meant to be for my children’s education and for my future while I worked on another book.’ He added: ‘I think that there are probably five or six more big-name writers caught up in this.’ Kureishi’s ordeal, which is the subject of a police investigation, began when he asked his representatives at The Agency, one of Britain’s most respected film agencies, to recommend a firm of accountants. The Agency, which also represents novelists William Boyd and Ian McEwan, suggested a firm called Fisher Phillips, which does its own accounts and also looks after some of its star names. Kureishi’s affairs were handed over to Adam Woricker, then a partner at the firm, who met the award-winning writer at his London home. It was at this meeting that Kureishi was first given details of an ill-fated property deal which he subsequently agreed to join. The author was told that if he invested £50,000 he would get a 15 per cent return within 120 days.Shortly after the first payment of £7,500 arrived, Kureishi agreed to invest a further £70,000. The first the author knew something was amiss was when Fisher Phillips contacted him to say Woricker had been fired. Bestsellers: My Beautiful Laundrette and The Buddha of Suburbia by Hanif Kureishi . He said: ‘Woricker appeared to be a very charming man and a very sweet guy. He said to me that numerous other clients of Fisher Phillips and many of my fellow writers, as he put it, were investing in this particular scheme.’ Kureishi, 58, is now bringing a claim against Fisher Phillips to try to get his money back. He said all his communications with Woricker were through the firm’s email system and he believed Woricker was acting on its behalf. Kureishi claims Fisher Phillips has subsequently behaved in a ‘disgraceful and shocking way’ and  even threatened him with legal action to try to stop him talking about his ordeal. Fisher Phillips denies it is liable because it had no prior knowledge of the scheme and it sacked Woricker as soon as it was discovered what he was allegedly doing. A spokesman said: ‘Adam Woricker was dismissed as a partner of Fisher Phillips in July 2012. 'We were made aware that he had been personally involved in raising finance for an investment scheme and we would like to stress that he was not acting on behalf of Fisher Phillips but in a personal capacity.’ Mr Woricker was arrested in March and bailed until May 28. He was unavailable for comment last night. The Mail on Sunday was also unable to reach anyone at The Agency for comment.","Best-selling writer was offered 15% return on investment .

But a writer at XOVain has taken it upon herself to show readers how they can recreate the looks sported in Lindsay Lohan's six mugshots. From the troubled starlet's first brush with the law in 2007, to her most recent mugshot last year, Annie Kreighbaum describes Miss Lohan's beauty evolution using herself as a model, demonstrating how she appears to have become ever-more prepared for the brutal flashbulb and harsh gray backdrop of a booking photo. Natural look: Lindsay Lohan's first mugshot look (left), taken after she was arrested for DUI in July 2007, is 'almost beach-y', says XOVain writer Annie Kreighbaum (right) Katie Price and Sylvester Stallone's love child: The next mugshot, from November 2007, sees Miss Lohan with far more make-up (left). Miss Kreighbaum doesn't rate the orange-tinted look on herself though (right) 'You can clearly see a progression,' she writes. 'In her first, she’s a little bewildered, a little bleary-eyed. Totally understandable. . . 'By . her sixth, almost six years later, she’s totally serving it! False . eyelashes, perfectly contoured cheeks, smug brows like she’s been there . before - because she had, like five times.' Miss Kreighbaum calls Miss Lohan's first mugshot look, taken after she was arrested for DUI in July 2007, 'almost beach-y', with particular praise for the tousled hair and freckles. She says 'abused eye make-up' is the way forward if one would also like to look 'upset and distraught', recommending a creamy pencil around the lash line. But to really elicit sympathy from one's booking officer, 'tweak out on an iced red eye.' This would appear to mean applying powder kohl to your waterline on a moving train 'so you'll really start to tear up', then removing it with a baby wipe. Sultry gaze: In July 2010, Miss Lohan's hair is sleeker and more groomed (left). To achieve the look, Miss Kreighbaum (right) used Urban Decay's 24/7 Glide On Pencil in the appropriately-named shade 'Delinquent' Wide awake: In September 2010's booking photo the star's hair, albeit greasy, was back to its natural red and her skin looked clear (left).

Not much appears to have changed by the next mugshot though, in July 2010, when Miss Lohan served 13 days at California's Lynwood jail for violating her probation. Self-tan and eyeliner still seem to be integral to her look. Her hair is sleeker and more groomed, however, and the eyeliner is less heavy. To achieve the look, Miss Kreighbaum turned to Urban Decay's 24/7 Glide On Pencil in the appropriately-named shade 'Delinquent'. September 2010's booking photo was taken . after the actress failed a drug test and was ordered to return to jail . for 30 days. She appealed and posted $300,000 bail before checking into . rehab. In this, we saw a completely different look altogether. Her hair, albeit greasy, was back to its natural red and her skin looked clear. Our writer suggests caramel-tinted brows and white eyeliner in the waterline to make you look awake. She adds that while a matte light pink lip has 'never worked' for her, she recommends Sephora's Color Lip Last in . Life in Pink to get Miss Lohan's look. In October 2011 Miss Lohan was subject . to yet another mugshot for failing to do her community service morgue . duty hours. She was sentenced to 30 days in jail and 400 hours of . community service, but spent just five hours behind bars due to overcrowding. The actress at this point was back to platinum blonde, her lips look swollen and her skin looks pale.

Nor, she insists, does she really look like Miss Lohan in real life and in fact 'I'm actually . mega attractive when I'm not impersonating Lindsay Lohan's mugshots.'

Jill Kelley, the Florida housewife whose complaint over threatening emails revealed David Petraeus' affair, has visited the White House three times in the past three months, it has emerged. In by far the most astonishing example of her determination to reach the top, the shrewd socialite and her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, were invited to two 'courtesy' meals in the Executive Mansion mess hall as a guest of a White House aide, an Obama administration official has revealed. She met the mid-level aide through her work with MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, where she also rubbed shoulders with the military's top brass, including General Petraeus. On one further occasion, she received a White House tour with her family, the official added. This latest revelation shows just how far Kelley soared from her humble beginnings as the daughter of Lebanese immigrants in Pennsylvania to the host of lavish military parties at her Florida mansion. Unstoppable: Jill Kelley, pictured with General Petraeus and his wife Holly at her home last year, visited the White House three times in three months as the guest of an aide, it has emerged . It also suggests that Kelley was telling the truth in an email she wrote to a reporter at the Tampa Bay Times on September 28, in which she boasted of visiting the White House. 'Btw I was made the (honorary) Ambassador to US Central Command's Coalition!' she wrote. 'In addition to that, I was just recently appointed to be the Honorary Consulate General to South Korea! I'm in DC today - just left from breakfast at the White House.... I really hope to see you soon!' Further examples also emerged today of how the married mother of three, who is reportedly steeped in debt, has attempted to exploit her connections as she finds herself at the centre of the military scandal. In her first words since her part was revealed, Kelley sent a string of pleading emails to the Tampa Mayor, complaining she has been receiving threats and claiming: 'The truth will one day prevail.' The anguished messages, seen by the Tampa Bay Times, were sent in the early hours of Tuesday and Wednesday to Bob Buckhorn, whom she knows socially. She . claims her three children are scared to return home and her doctor . husband has been forced to sleep at the hospital because he cannot get . into their driveway, due to the swarms of media.' Rubbing shoulders: Jill Kelley, left, and her twin sister Natalie Khawam pose with Marco Rubio, then a candidate for Senate, in March 2010. They only attended his event for the photo, staff said . 'Dear Mayor Bob,' she wrote, 'as you see on tv, my name (including Gen Petraeus & Allen) and home have been exploited by the media. 'I . wouldn't care - if they got the facts right and the focus was on the . criminal that stalked all of us,' she added, apparently referring to Petraeus' mistress Paula Broadwell. 'But the truth will . one day prevail.' Her reference to Allen - General John Allen - comes days after she was accused of exchanging tens of thousands of emails with him, with some deemed 'inappropriate' and 'flirtatious'. The emails are the . second instance of her trying to exploit her 'position' - after she . called the police asking for 'diplomatic protection' from the media due . to her role as honorary consul to South Korea. 'I'm an honorary consul general, so I . have inviolability, so they should not be able to cross my property,' she told the 911 operator. 'I don't know if you want to get diplomatic . protection involved as well, because that's against the law to cross my . property because, you know, it's inviolable.' Anxious: Jill Kelley, pictured leaving her Florida home earlier this week, has written pleading emails to the Tampa mayor complaining that she has been receiving threats and no help from the police . 'Courtesy': Kelley and her sister were invited to dine at the White House on two occasions by a mid-level aide . But the move backfired - with the police . releasing the calls to the media and failing to provide her the . protection reserved for those in positions of genuine authority. 'To put insult to injury, your police dept gave the local 911 tapes to the press!' she wrote to Buckhorn, adding that the recordings included her cell number, so 'I have been receiving threats all night'. 'I'm scared and cannot believe what my city, in which I have contributed so much of my love, time, money and leadership, has now done to me and my innocent family,' Kelley wrote. Buckhorn told the Times that he did . nothing in response to Kelley's complaint and simply said that the 911 . recordings were public records. He added that he knew the Kelleys . socially after he won the mayoral race in March 2011 - even though they . did not support him in his bid and he had never met them before. 'Fearful': She wrote that her surgeon husband Scott, pictured returning home on Thursday, has had to sleep at the hospital because he is unable to get into the drive because of the media by their house . Demands: She had earlier asked for diplomatic protection at her $1.3 million home in Tampa . Yet just three weeks after he was sworn . into office, the doctor and his wife hosted a reception for him at their . lavish $1.3 million home on Bayshore Boulevard. Emails: Kelley sent messages to Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn complaining about her treatment . Kelley has since invited him to a string of social events, including her daughter's sixth birthday party, which are also documented by email, the Times reported. She invited him and his wife to a dinner party for the King of Jordan and, after he was unable to attend, she wrote to him again. 'The King and his sister (the Princess) are awesome . people!' she said. 'Actually your name was brought up . by the Generals when they were showing off the party I hosted you! (everyone loved that party).' They met again when he and his wife gave her a ride home following an event at MacDill Air Force Base, for which she organised events as a volunteer social liaison officer. 'Gen. [James] Mattis, was so kind to offer, but I realised . you two were passing my way,' she emailed the mayor the following day. Their messages also show how she involved herself in a spat over a radio host's claims that he was going to deep fat fry the Koran earlier this year, according to the Times. Officers at MacDill told the mayor that the publicity stunt could harm troops, and asked him to speak with the host, nicknamed Bubba The Love Sponge. Kelley also called the mayor to tell them she had been speaking with . Gen. Allen and Vice Admiral Robert Harward, the deputy commander of . CentCom, who said they needed the mayor's help. Socialite: Kelley kisses General Petraeus at an awards ceremony for him at her home last year . Host: Kelley, who worked as a volunteer social liaison for the military, with Petreaus and his wife Holly . Close: Jill Kelley (second right) and her twin sister Natalie (left) are pictured with David Petraeus, his wife Holly and Kelley's husband Scott (centre) at a party at their Tampa home . 'I have Petraeus & Allen both emailing me to get this dealt with,' she wrote Buckhorn on March 7, but following up with: 'Gen. Allen will be calling me from Afghanistan at 1pm on this- and our next step.' When Buckhorn responded to say it was being dealt with, she said 'they asked me to get involved, like I did when it happened with the Pastor last year'. Kelley's shrewd social-climbing tactics also came to light this week when she was pictured with Marco Rubio and her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, when he was running for the Senate. The photograph was tweeted by Republican Angelette Aviles who said that it was taken at a March 2010 fundraiser, where tickets were $1,000. But the twins didn't pay - instead, they . appeared, took the photo and left, Aviles told the Times. They did not . contribute to his campaign. Who's who? A chart shows the connections between the major players in the Petraeus scandal . Yet over the past week, Kelley's connections have given her more exposure than she was perhaps intending. After David Petraeus dramatically resigned from the top of the CIA last Friday, it emerged that Kelley had played a key role in exposing his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. In May, Kelley alerted the FBI that she had been receiving threatening, anonymous emails warning her to 'back off' Petraeus, whom Kelley and her husband are good friends with. The FBI was forced to launch an in-depth investigation as some messages contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts, and they feared there could have been a security breach. Affair: Kelley tipped off the FBI about threatening emails she received from Paula Broadwell, right, and during their investigation they uncovered her affair with David Petraeus . 'Flirty': Kelley allegedly sent 'inappropriate' emails to Gen John Allen, pictured with his wife and daughter . The catty emails were traced back to Broadwell and, in the process of the investigation, agents also uncovered messages revealing the affair between the biographer and Petraeus. The scandal later dragged in another general, the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen, after the FBI investigated Kelley's emails from Broadwell. During the probe, they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email correspondence between Allen and Kelley, which officials said were 'flirtatious' and likened them to 'phone sex'. Both Allen and Kelley deny any wrongdoing. But Kelley has been told has been that she is no longer welcome at the military HQ near her Florida home.","Florida socialite and her sister Natalie Khawam 'were invited to two courtesy meals by White House and also received White House tour'

Sean Day-Lewis, 81, reportedly fell out with his famous brother over a 'misunderstanding' about a biography of the actor - pictured with his Oscar . The estranged brother of Daniel Day-Lewis has revealed he is  desperate to end their 19-year feud sparked by an unofficial biography of the actor. Sean Day-Lewis says that the Lincoln star – who last week made history as the first man to win three Best Actor Oscars – cut him off in 1994 and that the pair have not spoken since. Sean said: ‘He [Daniel] phoned me up and told me to get a f****** life and to f*** off. I couldn’t get a word in. That was our last conversation. I have no means of getting hold of Dan now except through his agent.’ Sean, 81, insists that his only crime was to lend another author a copy of a biography he himself had written about their father, the former Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis. ‘I only gave him [the author] my book because I wanted him to get the facts right, and he didn’t even do that – he got birthdays on the wrong days,’ he said. ‘It was full of errors. He acknowledged my help in the foreword and Dan saw that and completely blew me out of the water.’ Asked if he hoped the notoriously private actor, 55, would one day end his silence, he said: ‘I would like that, very much.’ Sean also revealed in the  interview, published yesterday, how the pair had previously enjoyed a good relationship, despite the 26-year age gap between the half-brothers. Their father had several affairs while he was married to Sean’s mother, Constance Mary King, before leaving her for actress Jill Balcon, Daniel’s mother. ‘We all got on quite well,’ he said. ‘Dan was a boy.

The crazed man who stabbed New Mexico choir director Adam Alvarez along with three others on Sunday believed he was '99 percent sure Alvarez was a mason' involved in a conspiracy against him. Lawrence Capener, 24, told investigators that he also stabbed the members of the public who tried to subdue him during his frenzied attack at St. Jude Thaddeus church because he feared they might be Masons too. He has been charged with three counts of aggravated battery and is currently being held on $250,000 bail in Albuquerque - and his arrest affadavit says he has apologized for the stabbings. Scroll down for videos . Lawrence Capener, 24, told investigators that he also stabbed New Mexico choir director Adam Alvarez because he was '99 percent sure Alvarez was a mason' involved in a conspiracy against him . Crime scene: St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the scene of a multiple stabbing at the conclusion of morning services . St. Jude Thaddeus' pastor, the Rev. John Daniel, said Capener's mother was 'very active' in the parish and serves as a Eucharistic minister there. 'He was here occasionally but not very often,' Daniel said. Daniel said that Capener had just graduated from a community college and appeared to be doing well after getting a job. 'I think he's been struggling for a while, maybe with some (mental) health issues,' Daniel said. The attacks began when Lawrence Capener was shaking hands with his fellow churchgoers at Sunday Mass - exchanging the traditional peace offerings when people next to him noticed something strange - his hands were quite sweaty and clammy. A cross and flowers are left outside Monday, April 29, 2013 by a parishioner at the St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church in Albuquerque a day after a man stabbed several churchgoers as Mass was ending . Then, as the choir began singing a hymn to wrap up Mass, the man bolted from his pew, ran to the choir area and started stabbing Alvarez and others, witnesses said. The random and violent attack by the knife-wielding Capener, 24, sparked confusion and fear in the Albuquerque Westside church as the choir started singing 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord.' According to a criminal complaint released Monday, Capener vaulted over pews and lashed out at choir director Adam Alvarez, who had his back toward him. The complaint said church flutist Gerald Madrid saw Alvarez being attacked and attempted to 'bear hug' Capener to try and stop him. Madrid was then stabbed five times in his back by Capener, authorities said. St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church in Albuquerque, NM: The man attacked four members of the choir including the lead singer before he was pinned to the floor . 'I instinctively just dropped my flute and I rushed the guy,' Madrid said. 'I never saw a knife, but I just rushed him.' At least two others were injured in the attack, police said. Capener later told police that he was '99 percent sure Alvarez was a mason' and that he thought Alvarez was involved in a conspiracy. He told the investigator that Masons are a group involved 'in a conspiracy that is far more reaching than I could or would believe.' Among those to subdue Capener was off-duty Albuquerque Fire Department Lt. Greg Aragon, who then helped treat patients after the attack, authorities said. He was also stabbed in the attack and was later treated at a hospital and released. The affidavit said Capener apologized for stabbing the others after he was read his rights and agreed to speak to police. Masons are a fraternal group involved in charity and other community activities, but many of their rituals and symbols are secret. Unprovoked: The attack occured just as the Sunday service was coming to an end when the man lept from the pews . Both Alvarez and Madrid remained hospitalized Monday and their families said the men were recovering from wounds that were described as not life-threatening. Services at the 3,000-member church resumed Monday. Parishioners stopped to leave flowers, notes and candles outside the church and at the church's shrine dedicated to St. Jude, the church's namesake and the Catholic Patron Saint of 'lost causes.' In Mass homilies throughout the day, Daniel said he compared St. Catherine of Siena, who worked for peace in 14th century Italy, with the power of forgiveness. Robynn Madrid, whose husband Gerald Madrid was recovering from the attack, said despite the pain Capener caused, she's already forgiven him. 'We're praying for his family,' she said. Spanish choir member Richard Aragon said he, too, is trying to show compassion and forgiveness, even though he had trouble sleeping the night after the stabbing. Aragon was preparing for the upcoming Spanish services when the attack began. 'There's nothing you can do. There's obviously something...he's touched or something,' Aragon said. 'It already happened. It's too late.' Two parishioners told the Los Angeles Times that a man in his teens or early 20s leaped from the pews and stabbed the choir's lead singer at after communion at St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church. 'While that was going on, people were just panicking. It was scary, you wouldn’t think something like that would happen in church,' said Reyes Stinson, 18. Another member of the congregation, Vanessa Lucero, 14, said she was sitting right behind the man, who 'was kind of twitchy, sketchy looking. He had a tattoo of an upside-down star on his wrist.' She said the man climbed over the pews, punched and then repeatedly stabbed the choir's lead singer. Ms Lucero who was witness to the entire incident said that as the man was being handcuffed old ladies who were present were telling him to forgive himself. Archbishop of Santa Fe Michael Sheehan released a statement saying he was saddened by the attack. 'I pray for all who have been harmed, their families, the parishioners and that nothing like this will ever happen again,' Sheehan said. In a statement, Albuquerque police have confirmed the man is now in custody but have not yet released him name. They also have been unable to determine a motive for the attacks.","Lawrence Capener, 24, told investigators that he also stabbed New Mexico choir director Adam Alvarez because he was '99 percent sure Alvarez was a mason' involved in a conspiracy against him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:42 EST, 15 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:41 EST, 16 April 2012 . President Barack Obama said yesterday that 'of course I'll be angry' if allegations that Secret Service agents hired prostitutes are proven true by an investigation. Obama said the agents represent the United States and are supposed to conduct themselves with the highest levels of dignity anywhere in the world. 'Obviously, what's been reported doesn't match up to those standards,' Obama said in a news conference wrapping his appearance at a Latin America summit. Obama's remarks came after Rep Darrell Issa, claimed the scandal was likely not the first time members of the president's protection team have invited prostitutes back to their rooms. Luxury retreat: The 11 recalled Secret Service Agents were staying at the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena, Colombia . 'Angry': President Barack Obama briefly addressed the scandal at a press conference Sunday, saying the agents didn't live up to their standards . Issa, who heads the powerful House . Oversight and Government Reform Committee, believes the wild hotel party . ahead of Obama's arrival for the Summit of the Americas is evidence . that the agency could be covering up other misdeeds in the ranks of . America's most elite civil servants. And he hinted even more agents than . the 11 recalled to Washington last week could be involved in this . scandal. Obama blasted the agents accused of misconduct, saying: 'We are representing the people of the United States, and when we travel to another country, I expect us to observe the highest standards.' On Friday, 11 Secret Service agents, including two supervisors, were shipped back to Washington and suspended after local police and hotel security staffers became involved in a dispute between an agent and a Colombian prostitute broke out at the luxury Hotel Caribe -- after the agent refused to fork over $47. Rep Peter King, who was briefed on the incident, said 'nearly all' of the agents on the team, many of whom are married, had prostitutes in their rooms that night. Five US military personnel who were helping the agents were confined to their quarters after the Defense Department learned they might have been involved, as well. Issa said he hasn't decided whether his committee would independently investigate the prostitution allegations. However, he said he planned to 'look over the shoulder' of federal investigators. The allegations, which could have opened the agents up to blackmail, require the agency to do 'some soul-searching' about its personnel are screened and trained. 'Things like this don't happen once if they didn't happen before,' he said on Face the Nation. 'We think the number (of agents involved) might be higher, and we're asking for the exact amount of all the people who were involved,' he added. Issa, a California Republican, linked the agents' misbehavior, which wasn't illegal, with the General Service Administration controversy, which saw employees of that agency spend $820,000 on a glitzy conference in Las Vegas. The Secret Service team was in the country to scout out the security situation ahead of Obama's trip there for the Summit of the Americas this weekend. They reportedly capped off a week of heavy drinking at the beachfront Hotel Caribe in Cartagena by cavorting with prostitutes. Not the first: Rep Darrell Issa said the scandal could go much wider and deeper within the Secret Service . Rep King, said he was told that anyone visiting the hotel overnight was required to leave identification at the front desk and leave the hotel by 7am. When a woman failed to do so, it raised questions among hotel staff and police, who investigated. They found the woman with the agent in the hotel room and a dispute arose over whether the agent should have paid her. Mr King said he was told that the agent did eventually pay the woman. The incident was reported to the U.S. embassy, prompting further investigation. Security breach: Experts say the agents' behavior could have endangered the president, though the White House says that was never the case . In the field: The agents were in Colombia the week before President Obama's arrival to the Summit of the Americas . Beachfront property: The Hotel Caribe is a luxury resort that costs about $160 to $200 per night . During their week-long stay at the five-star hotel in Cartagena, the agents were seen drinking heavily, according to waiters there. A number of the White House staff and traveling press corps . were also staying at the hotel. The White House said Mr Obama had been briefed about the incidents but would not comment on his reaction. 'The President does have full confidence in the United States Secret Service,' presidential spokesman Jay Carney said when asked. Mr Carney insisted the matter was more a distraction for the media than Mr Obama. But Secret Service assistant director Paul Morrissey said in a statement: 'We regret any distraction from the Summit of the Americas this situation has caused.' The Washington Post reported that Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said the accusations related to at least one agent having involvement with prostitutes. The association represents federal law enforcement officers, including the Secret Service. President Barack Obama (blue shirt) surrounded by Secret Service agents during a visit to the Port of Tampa, Florida on his way to the Summit of the Americas in Colombia . Security: Police patrol the waters surrounding the convention centre in Cartagena where the Summit is held . Ronald Kessler, a former Post . reporter and the author of a book about the Secret Service, told the . newspaper that he had learned that among the agents involved, several are married. Although prostitution is legal in . parts of Colombia, the Secret Service is said to consider solicitation . inappropriate behaviour for its agents. Colombia . has become known as 'the Thailand of Latin America' for its loose laws . on prostitution and the easy availability of sex workers.

'These personnel changes will not affect the comprehensive security plan . that has been prepared in advance of the President’s trip,' said Mr Donovan of the conference in the Colombian port city attended by Obama and more than 30 world leaders. He said the allegations of misconduct were related to activity before the president's arrival on Friday night.

Mr Obama was attending a leaders' dinner on Friday night at Cartagena's historic Spanish fortress. He was due to attend summit meetings with regional leaders on Saturday and Sunday.

The matter was turned over to the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles the agency's internal affairs. On the steamy streets of Cartagena, a resort city with a teeming prostitution trade, there was condemnation for the Secret Service agents for what residents saw as abusing their station and dishonoring their country. Edwin Yepes, a souvenir vendor, said: 'They are supposed to come here and set an example. We are an inferior culture, and so it's better if they don't come than if they damage our image of them.'","Several of the 11 men sent home are married; two are supervisors .

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received a complaint that the ad was offensive, harmful and irresponsible for portraying the model as a school-aged child. Mate1.com did not respond to the ASA's enquiries. Facebook said the ad was in violation of its guidelines and had been disabled, as had any other ads using the same image. They had also issued a warning to the advertiser. The ASA said the model would be understood by readers as being of school age due to her youthful appearance and the impression that she was wearing a school uniform.

Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross faced a storm of protest yesterday after he appeared to suggest women could ‘aggravate’ their risk of being raped. The broadcaster likened women who dressed and behaved provocatively to banks storing cash by the front door, or motorists leaving laptops on the back seat of their cars. He insisted he was not blaming victims – saying ‘No amount of temptation can excuse rape’ – but questioned whether some women chose not to pursue complaints because they felt partly responsible. Nick Ross wrote in his new book that 'not all rape is rape' and said that some situations are more complicated . In an extract from his new book, . published in the Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘Rape victims were once . treated appallingly, as though it was all their fault, but have we now . gone too far the other way? ‘Many of the victims seem to think we . have. The main argument of my book is this: we can aggravate crime by . tempting fate, and we curb it by playing safe. ‘We have come to acknowledge it is . foolish to leave laptops on the back seat of a car. We would laugh at a . bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door. We would be aghast if . an airport badly skimped on its security measures. ‘Our forebears might be astonished at . how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been . regarded as incitement. ‘Not even in the licentious days of . Charles II in the 17th Century was it acceptable for women to dress as . provocatively as they have done in Western culture since the 1960s. Equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted, stay out . late, often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss, grope or go . to bed with one-night stands.’ Ross cited 'booze culture' as one of the reasons that the situation is more complicated. He added that our forebears would have been shocked with how women behave these days . Mr Ross, 65, who presented Crimewatch . from 1984 to 2007, provoked outrage among campaigners against rape and . on social networking sites. He said the Mail on Sunday had . misquoted him in its headline, which said ‘Not all women are victims and . not all rape is rape’, but said the edited extract was fair. Campaigners described his remarks as . ‘outdated and ridiculous’ and former Conservative MP Louise Mensch . described the extract as ‘pretty damning’. Another former Crimewatch . presenter, Jacqui Hames, said on Twitter: ‘Struggling to match the man I . know with the comments!!!! What on earth is going on?’ But Mr Ross also received several messages of support, including one from a woman who described herself as ‘a multiple victim’. In his book Crime, serialised in the . Mail on Sunday, Mr Ross described how former Justice Secretary Ken . Clarke faced outcry in 2011 when he used the phrase ‘serious rape’. Mr Ross wrote: ‘It has become sacrilege to suggest that there can be any gradation: rape is rape. Ross is famous for presenting Crimewatch with the late presenter Jill Dando . ‘The real experts, the victims, know . otherwise. Half of all women who had had penetrative sex unwillingly do . not think they were raped, and this proportion rises strongly when the . assault involves a boyfriend, or if the woman is drunk or high on drugs: . they led him on, they went too far, it wasn’t forcible, they didn’t . make themselves clear... For them, rape isn’t always rape and, however . upsetting, they feel it is a long way removed from being systematically . violated or snatched off the street.’ Mr Ross said the book was ‘serious, . carefully researched and evidence-based’ and an attempt to have a . reasoned debate about a sensitive subject. He told the Daily Mail: ‘Of course I . do not compare a woman to a laptop. That is nothing short of . misrepresentation of my message. ‘What I am saying is that opportunity . and temptation are key  factors in all crimes, and so far as the . evidence goes sex crimes are no exception. ‘Far from blaming people my book says . we are too quick to blame, and that it tends to distract us from . finding solutions to crime.’","Ross forced to defend himself after a backlash against his new book .

The war-torn Afghan capital of Kabul was once a place where cinema was outlawed under the fanatical rule of the Taliban. However, a decade after the brutal regime fell, film makers from Afghanistan have created a celluloid tribute to their battle-scarred city. Kabul, I Love You has been described as a love letter to the capital, rooted in the grim reality of everyday life for its citizens. Film-makers on the set of Kabul, I Love You, created a decade after the fall of the cinema-hating Taliban . Issues . such as forced marriage, people smuggling, illegal land grabs, land . mines and ethnic conflict is explored through 10 interwoven stories in the film. Afghanistan's film industry was hammered by 17 years of war after the Soviet invasion in 1979 and was snuffed out entirely under the extreme rule of the Taliban. During their 1996-2001 regime, the extremists closed cinemas and hung televisions from lampposts, regarding all images as un-Islamic. Even sculptures were targeted, with the famous giant Buddhas of Bamiyan paying the price. Now Afghan cinema is struggling to . re-emerge amid a wrecked economy and an ongoing insurgency against the . Western-backed government of President Hamid Karzai. According . to documentary-maker Malek Shafi'i, Afghanistan produces about 100 . films a year but they are usually shot on small budgets and are often . very poor. Kabul, I Love You has been funded by the UN mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, as a means of giving the country's cinema a boost. Ario Soltani, from UNAMA, says the idea was to encourage film-makers to develop their own ideas. Afghan cinema is struggling to re-emerge amid a wrecked economy and an ongoing insurgency against the Western-backed government of President Hamid Karzai . Young men watch crew members from Kabul, I Love You working on set. Afghanistan produces about 100 films a year but they are usually shot on small budgets and are often very poor . He said: 'We wanted to reach the film-makers, to support them, to communicate with Afghan people. 'Not with our messages but with theirs. We hope they reflect the Afghan society and the Afghan ideas of that time.' However, funding the project was not without its problems. One of the 11 directors chosen from 200 applicants fled the country as soon as he got his hands on UNAMA's $8,000, while another left for Iran after being threatened. However, despite these setbacks, . shooting for the film was completed and it got a warm reception when it . was screened at the French cultural centre in Kabul in May. While . some of the entries betrayed the directors' lack of experience - with . exaggerated characters, hammy dialogue and a deathly slow pace - other . showed real flair. Critics particularly liked the modest and restrained dialogue of Farhad Razae's bitter denunciation of forced marriage. In the short section - titled Virgin . Towers - the caretaker of a mosque learns that a pretty young woman in . his place of worship has fled her family to escape marrying one of her . relatives. In the last five years, writers and artists have been pushing boundaries in what remains an extremely conservative society in Afghanistan . The young woman, denounced by a neighbour, ends up running from the police. Her heavy breath and field of vision restricted by the burqa she wears to hide herself allow the viewer to feel the horror of the condition of women in Afghanistan. Rezae said he based the film on experiences he had as a young man looking after a mosque. He said: 'During that time, a girl was coming for prayers. She would rest in the mosque two hours after the prayers. I wanted to know who this girl is, but I was ashamed and because of religion, I never asked her what her problems were.' Shafi'i hailed Rezae's achievement, saying he had 'managed to get closer to Afghan realities' than other film-makers. Shafi'i added that, in the last five years, writers and artists have been pushing boundaries in what remains an extremely conservative society. He said: 'Now, people have started to realise that if they cross borders, nothing will happen to them.' NATO forces are due to depart Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and the precarious security situation they will leave behind is not likely to be conducive to this dream of artistic growth. It is hoped Kabul, I Love You will send out a message of hope to budding film-makers and other citizens of Afghanistan.","Film is described as a love letter to the Afghan capital a decade after the fall of the brutal regime .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:47 EST, 10 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:35 EST, 11 September 2012 . The jailed Pakistani doctor who helped led the U.S. to Osama Bin Laden's hideout has revealed that Pakistan’s spy agency considers America its worst enemy. Dr Shakil Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in prison in June after a Pakistani court found him guilty of treason for conspiring against Pakistan. The physician said he has been subjected to torture and harsh questioning since his arrest days after Bin Laden’s death in May 2011 as he tried to flee Pakistan. And he also claimed that he did not know that the information he provided to the CIA had led to the assassination of the reclusive Al Qaeda leader. The good doctor: Dr Shakil Afridi was convicted of treason in June, and sentenced to 33 years in prison despite leading the U.S. to Osama bin Laden's hideout in Abottabad, Pakistan . In an interview with Fox News from his Pakistan jail cell, Dr Afridi says he has been told: ‘You helped our enemies. 'They said ""The Americans are our worst enemies, worse than the Indians.""' Dr Afridi said he tried to defend the U.S. as allies and supporters of Pakistan. He told Fox news: 'I tried to argue that America was Pakistan's biggest supporter - billions and billions of dollars in aid, social and military assistance - but all they said was, ""These are our worst enemies. You helped our enemies.""' Speaking out: Dr Shakil Afridi helped the CIA track down bin Laden and turned down an opportunity to leave Pakistan and . resettle overseas with his family . Dr Afridi also warned that any cooperation by Pakistan is just a front for the country to collect billions of dollars in aid from the U.S. “It is now indisputable that militancy in Pakistan is supported by the ISI… Pakistan’s fight against militancy is bogus. It’s just to extract money from America.' Dr Afridi helped the CIA by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the DNA of Bin Laden’s children from the family compound in Abbottabad. Sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by US Navy SEALS last May. The successful mission sparked a rift between the US and Pakistani leaders who were embarrassed that Bin Laden had been living in a major military hub close to the capital. Dead: The killing of notorious terror leader Osama Bin Laden led to a decline in the relationship between Pakistan and the U.S. Imprisoned: Pakistani doctor Shakil Afridi talks with people . outside a building at an unknown location, prior to his arrest . Shortly after the raid which killed Bin Laden, Dr Afridi was arrested for conspiring against the state of Pakistan and last month jailed for 33 years. In May, outraged at Dr Afridi's conviction, U.S. Senate panels voted overwhelmingly to cut aid to Islamabad by $33million - one million for every year of the physician's 33-year sentence for high treason. And perhaps Pakistan is feeling the pinch, as the doctor also claims that his life savings has been depleted after the ISI drained his bank accounts. Dr Afridi told Fox News: 'My bank account was looted, making me bankrupt. I need financial, legal and diplomatic help.' Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces . He added: 'My situation is very grim. I earned millions of rupees (tens of thousands of dollars) a year and supported my family and that of my brother. All of that is lost.' While Dr. Afridi is appealing his conviction, his chances are slim because of the arbitrary nature of the tribal court system where he is facing justice in Pakistan. Officials from the United States have revealed in the past that they attempted to extricate Dr Afridi from Pakistan in the weeks after the bin Laden raid. Unnamed U.S. officials said the resettlement offer for Afridi came around the time of the May 1, 2011, raid in which U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed the al-Qaeda chief at his complex in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Tense: The moment President Barack Obama and his . team watched the mission to find bin Laden in the Situation Room of the .

Sally Bercow named a teenager who allegedly ran away with a teacher and her Twitter account has now gone . Sally Bercow today finally deleted her Twitter account - after revealing  she had her 'a**-whipped' by her lawyer and husband over her latest legal blunder. The most recent high-profile error was naming a British runaway schoolgirl protected by a court order - with her her final tweet revealing the intervention from a lawyer and the Speaker of the Commons. The breach prompted calls for her to 'turn off Twitter' to avoid any more legal problems. It also appears her account may have been hijacked overnight, as at 2.21am a tweet in broken English appeared under her name calling her a 'stupid woman'. Naming the teenager means Mrs Bercow could face a £5,000 fine for contempt of court after breaching the order which bans revealing the identity of the girl who allegedly ran away with her teacher to France this year. Sussex Police would not confirm if they had received complaints about her tweet, but told MailOnline they 'will actively investigate potential criminal breaches of these restrictions'. And her exit from Twitter comes just a fortnight after she used the site to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine following a BBC2 Newsnight report which alleged a senior Conservative figure from the Thatcher era was a child abuser. He was not named on the programme but was identified quickly online. It later emerged that he was the victim of mistaken identity. Lord McAlpine, who settled with the BBC for £185,000, is now suing Mrs Bercow, although she insists that what she said on Twitter was ‘mischievous’ rather than ‘libellous’. Her latest blunder happened on Sunday, when she named the teenage girl on Twitter. This tweet has since been deleted. She then wrote another message to her 59,000 followers, saying she had been discussing the matter with a friend. She had been referring to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a 30-year-old teacher in Eastbourne, East Sussex, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September and returned to Britain.

Final tweet: In a message to her thousands of followers Mrs Bercow revealed she had a telling off after naming the girl and that she hoped to be back . Hacked?: This curious tweet appeared under her name calling her a 'stupid woman' and saying she had a soft password . He was charged with abducting a child and remanded in custody at a court hearing last week. The court made a Section 39 Order under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, banning the naming of the teenager.

Her recent on-screen antics have had TOWIE fans glued to their screens as she put the men of Essex firmly in their place and although the series ends this week the bubbly blonde has no intention of taking things easy as she unveils her third fashion collection for plus size women. The fashion line, which is available in sizes 14-22 and was launched last year, has proved to be a brilliant success for the Romford business woman. As a woman who embraces her curves, the 32-year-old is well placed to design fashion that flatters and her frank style advice has secured her an army of fans as well as a regular presenting slot on ITV's This Morning show. The Cheltenham Dress (also available in black and mocha) £65 . The Montana Dress (also available in black) £60 . Her latest collection is designed . with the summer season in mind, with bright colours and glamorous . details giving the dresses a more grown-up feel. The former car sales assistant has . reworked the most popular styles from her previous two collections in . new colour ways (the Rome maxi dress now comes in block-colour and the . lace 'Prague' dress has been made in a sophisticated navy). Gemma said: 'I am so excited that my new spring summer range of the Gemma Collins Collection is finally here. 'This new range is fresh, vibrant and . I have designed it using gorgeous fabrics that make the bigger girl . feel a million dollars. The Rome Dress £60 . The Amalfie Dress (also available in black/peach) £70 .

'It sounds silly but I have no . favourites in the range really as I love them all the same. I would . never design something that I didn’t feel passionate about it and these . are all beauties. 'I like to use colour as I want to celebrate curves. The plus size market to date is dull and depressing, I want big girls to feel accepted in society and be joyous and bright when they put clothes on. 'I choose the prints and colours from the feeling I get from them. If a fabric makes me smile or makes me get excited then I know it's the right choice. 'Being a bigger girl I feel the limited plus size high street shops offer all the wrong fabrics so I spent 6 months learning about fabrics feeling them researching them and realised the slinky fabrics that skim the curves are most flattering. The Canada Top £40 . The Rome Dress £60 . 'I love all the old film stars really . Marylin Monroe, Diana Dors and Jayne Mansfield. These women took . glamour to the max. I like the Karsdashian sisters' style as they rock . their curves. 'I work spontaneously. I wake up at 4am some mornings thinking about designs. 'My main passion for designing is taking in trends and thinking how can I make this flattering and fun for the fuller figure?'

But six months in, the Duchess of Cambridge is blooming – and seems to be taking full advantage of her radiant health. Kate has undertaken no fewer than five public engagements in eight days, giving a masterclass in the art of maternity dressing along the way. Radiant: The Duchess of Cambridge was wearing a peach £375 Tara Jarmon coat yesterday . Yesterday the duchess completed her busy week with a visit to a children’s hospice in Hampshire. Sadly Prince William wasn’t by her side, despite it being the couple’s second wedding anniversary. The duchess, 31, blushed when she was asked whether William was taking her out for the occasion, explaining that he was on duty as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot in Anglesey, North Wales. Professor Khalid Aziz, chairman of trustees at Naomi House Children’s Hospice near Winchester, told Kate: ‘It’s especially special that you came here today because … two years ago to the day, you were in a slightly larger building than this one – probably not having quite as much fun. ‘But you did it very well, we were all totally enthralled. I just hope Prince William is taking you somewhere nice tonight.’ All dressed up: On April 21, Kate was smart in a £1,750 Mulberry coat and £99 Whiteley hat in Windsor and two days later she went for a £1,065 Erdem dress and £350 Prada heels for trip to Manchester . Bumping along: Back in London on April 24 she went designer in an Emilia Wickstead dress estimated to cost £2,500, but followed up on April 26 with a £38 Topshop dress and £800 Ralph Lauren jacket . At this, the duchess blushed bright red and opened her arms expressively. ‘Well he’s on shift, so …’, she trailed off. But she was delighted when he gave her an anniversary present from the hospice’s children, in the form of a framed picture of the Very Hungry Caterpillar featuring all their fingerprints. The picture, from the classic children’s book, was on cotton – the traditional symbol for a second wedding anniversary. Kate, who met some of the hospice’s children and their parents at a tea party, wore a £375 apricot coloured Tara Jarmon coat, teamed with a peach dress made by her personal dressmaker and her favourite nude LK Bennett heels. Loving touch, just like Diana: The Duchess of Cambridge seems to have the same ability to charm children as Princess Diana, pictured in Sao Paulo in 1996 . It was a perfectly peachy ending to a week of impeccable fashion choices, which revealed Kate’s growing baby bump. First up was a mint green Mulberry coat for a trip to Windsor for the Queen’s Scouts Awards last Sunday. On Tuesday she chose an Erdem silk floral dress as she headed to the Wythenshawe Estate in Manchester, while on Wednesday she dressed perfectly for a warm evening at the National Portrait Gallery in London in a bespoke Emilia Wickstead baby blue cocktail dress. And she showed her thrifty credentials on Friday, wearing a £38 Topshop dress for a tour of the Harry Potter experience in Hertfordshire with William and Prince Harry. It is believed Kate and William enjoyed a private weekend away in Norfolk to mark their anniversary.","The Duchess of Cambridge has been keeping busy with her bump .

The 87-year-old naturalist was fitted with a pacemaker, which is normally used to correct an abnormal heartbeat. Doctors were said to be satisfied with his progress, although he was forced to cancel a sold-out speaking tour of Australia, due to start next week. Scroll down for video . Surgery: The veteran wildlife presenter, seen on the Jonathan Ross Show in February this year, is undergoing heart surgery today . A spokesman said his cardiologist had . told him he needed a pacemaker fitted urgently and added: ‘Obviously . after that you can’t take a long-haul flight.’ The BBC released a brief statement . from director of television Danny Cohen saying: ‘We all wish Sir David a . full and strong recovery.’ Although he is thought not to have a . history of heart problems, Sir David suffers from high blood pressure, . which can increase the danger of heart attacks and strokes. Animal lover: The broadcaster is pictured with an eagle during filming for his series The Life of Birds . Close to nature: Sir David, seen meeting a three-month-old black rhino at a Kenyan wildlife reserve, has travelled the world making ground-breaking documentaries . Expert: The natural history expert, seen interacting with a kangaroo at a zoo in Sydney, had been due to travel to Australia next week . Tour: Sir David, 87, had been due to embark on a sold-out tour of Australia next week, which has been cancelled in light of his health issue . Last year his film director brother . Richard, 89, was admitted to a care home for retired actors after being . confined to a wheelchair by a stroke. Their younger brother John, 83, a retired motor industry executive, died in November from a degenerative brain condition. Pacemaker implantation involves inserting a small battery-operated device into a patient's chest, which emits regular electrical pulses that help to keep the heart beating regularly. The contractions of the heart muscle that pump blood around the body are triggered by electrical pulses. Should those natural pulses be disrupted for any reason, resulting in an abnormal heartbeat or arrhythmia, a pacemaker may be fitted. Common causes of arrhythmia include sick sinus syndrome, where the heart beats abnormally slowly, atrial fibrillation, where it beats abnormally fast, or a heart block, where the pulse that triggers the contraction of the heart muscle is either delayed or absent.Sir David is having a pacemaker implanted today . The small metal box is attached to one or more wires - or pacing leads - that run to the heart. It contains a battery, pulse generator and tiny computer circuit that converts energy from the battery into electrical impulses which then flow down the wires and stimulate the heart to contract. The relatively straightforward implantation process is carried out under local anaesthetic, meaning the patient is awake throughout the procedure. Typically the generator is inserted beneath the skin near the collarbone, and attached to a wire that is guided through a blood vessel to the heart. The procedure, which usually lasts between 30 and 60 minutes, is one of the most common types of heart surgery, and most people are well enough to leave hospital the day after the surgery. Sir David, whose 60-year BBC career . included a stint as controller of BBC2, was due to speak about his life . and work in Brisbane on June 11. The tour also included events in . Canberra, Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. The Australian promoter, Lateral . Event Management, said it had been cancelled ‘with regret’, adding: ‘Sir . David expressed his extreme disappointment as he said he was very much . looking forward to coming back  to Australia and he hopes to reschedule . his tour in the near future.’ A pacemaker is a small, . battery-operated device inserted into the  patient’s chest.

Campaigners are pushing for chemical castration to be introduced as a way of treating sex offenders in the UK. The medical treatment which decreases . mens' sex drives using hormones, is already mandatory for child sex . offenders in Poland, Russia and certain U.S. states. The treatment is gaining popularity . in Canada too, where Dr Paul Federoof, an expert in sexual behaviour who advocates it as a way to treat sex offenders, holds a clinic. Today . as part of the This Morning's Crime Week hosts Holly Willoughby and . Philip Schofield spoke to Dr Federoof and one of his patients 'Steve' (not his real name) who volunteered himself for chemical castration after . his rape and murder fantasies started to become dangerous. As part of their Crime Week programming This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby interviewed Dr Paul Federoof, an expert in sexual behaviour, and one of his patients 'Steve' In his early twenties, Steve started to fantasise about raping and killing women. He would seek out women as he drove around in his car, and even planned the 'perfect crime'. Fortunately his plan backfired and, so concerned was he that he was a risk to women, he sought help from Dr Fedoroff who put him on a programme of chemical castration, to decrease his sex drive. Disguising his identity with a hooded jacket and speaking with his back to the camera Steve said: 'It started with me cheating on my then partner, this led to me looking online to meet people and everything progressed from there. 'The sex became more boring over time so I started looking for more extreme methods. 'I enjoyed the challenge of meeting someone online and seeing how fast I could get them in to bed. 'It progressed to being more violent and then the fantasies of sexual assault and rape started ... and then I thought of killing the women I was sleeping with.' Steve (right) volunteered himself for chemical castration after his rape and murder fantasies started to become dangerous . Talking about the night that his darkest fantasies almost became a reality Steve said: 'I went out that night to do it. I purchased specific tools and had them in the trunk of my car. Chemical . castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production . of testosterone, leading to a decreased sex drive. Poland introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009, it was introduced in South Korea in September and Russia and Moldova are following suit. Both . Germany and the Czech Republic have been criticised by Europe's top . human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex . offenders. 'I drove around and got an individual in to my car. It was easy, but I never harmed her.' Steve's therapists believe that it was the fact that he started a conversation with the women that saved her life. Steve, who had a girlfriend throughout the time, said: 'What I discovered with my therapist is that when it came to people that I knew I had no interest in assaulting or raping them. My girlfriend was never harmed.' Steve volunteered himself to undergo chemical castration and counselling with Dr Feredoof and was assessed as being extremely dangerous according to the standard phallometric test. Once he started the treatment he noticed results almost immediately. He said: 'The removal of my sex drive did occur quite rapidly and made me a lot more comfortable. I lost interest in acting out my thoughts, I had no sex for a year and a half.' Dr Federoff said: 'It is certainly no quick fix, but almost every time we do this things turn out very well.' Steve told Holly and Phillip that he noticed results almost immediately, he said: 'The removal of my sex drive did occur quite rapidly. I lost interest in acting out my thoughts.'

Barely 12 hours after the last firework popped over the Olympic Park last night, the centrepiece venue of the Games looked like a ghost town. There wasn't a spectator in sight today at the Olympic Park stadium in Stratford, as athletes, visitors and VIPs began their exodus from the capital. After 16 days of non-stop sporting action on the grounds in Stratford, proceedings were officially brought to a close at last night's closing ceremony. What a difference a day makes: The Olympic Park was completely empty today after it opened its doors to thousands over the course of the Games . Crawling: The Olympic Park has seen hundreds of thousands of spectators on its grounds throughout the Games . The party's over: The set of the closing ceremony is dismantled and taken away today . What a difference a day makes: The Olympic Park stadium was packed out yesterday for the closing ceremony . Instead it was the morning after the night before. Workmen and Park staff were on site to clear up the mess from the blockbuster closing ceremony. As the excellent weather finally gave way, the workers packed away the sets and props from the closing ceremony under overcast skies as the party seemed to be well and truly over. At its 80,000 seat capacity, the stadium looked like a shell as the dust settled after last night's spectacular. The Spice Girls, George Michael, Madness and One Direction - amongst others - wowed the packed venue until midnight last night, but there wasn't a soul in sight today. Many did not want the proceedings to draw to a close. In fact, athletes and celebrities took to Twitter to voice their disdain that the Games was drawing to a close. Game over: The Olympic flame was put out last night . Burning bright: The cauldron was extinguished gradually at the end of the closing ceremony, signalling the end of the London Olympics . Danny Boyle's innovative cauldron was slowly opened up and extinguished at the end of the closing ceremony - officially signalling the end of London's third Olympic Games in its history. Sir Chris Hoy said: 'If they don't put the flame out, the Games won't be over. Someone stop them!!'Stephen Fry tweeted: 'I don't want it to end *sob* *stamps foot*.' Others were simply glad to have been part of the historic Olympics closing gambit. Model Jourdan Dunn tweeted: 'Highlight of my career so far, feel so honoured.'

I love you girls so much!!!!!', and fellow Spice Girl Mel B said: 'Soooo much fun!' Ghost town: Workmen packed up the set at the Olympic Park after the party ended . Rock on: The stadium was glowing and bouncing for the close of the Games last night . But the Games hasn't left the capital just yet. The Paralympic Games is due to start  at the end of the month, with the opening ceremony taking place on August 29. With more than 2.1 million tickets sold out of a total of 2.5million, the current Paralympics is already beating the previous record of 1.8 million ticket sales at Beijing in 2008. So Olympic Park will be thriving once again for at least a week and a half until the closing ceremony on August 9. After that though the stadium is likely to close for a year, and could be taken over by local east London football club West Ham. There is also talk of the stadium being kept as an athletics venue, however it will be difficult to get even close to the 80,000 capacity until the World Championships are hosted in London in five years time.

Taco Bell has taken decisive action against their now infamous taco licking employee by announcing he has been sacked. On Monday, fast food fans collectively wretched as a shocking photograph of a red-haired man licking a stack of unfilled shells was discovered on Taco Bell's official Facebook page. While the identity of the licker has yet to be revealed, the man in question has apparently taken to social media to provide a picture of himself and confirm he has lost his job because of his disgusting stunt. Tongue lashing: This unnamed employee has lost his job after this photograph was posted to the Taco Bell Facebook page and went viral . The photograph was posted on Sunday by a 'Jj O'Brien Nolan' and it set off a PR nightmare for the fast food chain. They said that the photo was created as a jibe against a company wide contest in which employees submitted enjoying their first bite of the heavily hyped Cool Ranch Dorito taco. Today, in response to a deluge of negative publicity, Taco Bell confirmed that the worker had been identified and fired. 'Our franchisee is responsible for the employment and conduct of his restaurant’s employees and he has informed us that he immediately suspended the employee shown in the photo and is in the process of terminating his employment. 'The employee who took the photo no longer works there.' Initially it was not confirmed whether the photograph was a fake or if the tacos were indeed meant for the trash or were used in food preparation. Taco Bell denied they were. Taco trials: It has emerged that the restaurant where the photograph was taken is in Ridgecrest, California . 'Our food handling procedures are strict and we have zero tolerance for any violations,' Taco Bell said in a statement released on Monday. 'The taco shells were used for training in March before we launched a new product, and were in process of being thrown out.' Going further later in the day after the picture was widely shared across the Internet, Taco Bell tried to get a handle on the situation. 'Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and team members, and we have strict food handling procedures and zero tolerance for any violations,' said a statement. 'When we learned of the situation we immediately contacted this restaurant's leadership and although we believe it is a prank and the food was not served to customers, we are conducting a full scale investigation and will be taking swift action against those involved.' Today it was confirmed that the restaurant was in Ridgecrest, California and that the unidentified staff member has indeed been fired. Cathy Marx, the manager of Taco Bell in Ridgecrest, Calif., told CNBC, 'We’re currently dealing with it.' Taco Bell immediately replied to the original posting onto Facebook by Jj O'Brien Nolan - defending their food practices and promising swift action . Marx's restaurant has an A rating from the Kern County public health department, the report noted. Despite the risks of being caught, this isn't the first time fast food workers have gotten into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media. In April, a KFC worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on Facebook and was promptly fired by her employer. Last year, three Burger King employees from Ohio were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their Facebook pages. And in another shameful Taco Bell image, a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in August last year. ‘I pissed on them where nobody could see, in private, and I threw them away. There’s literally nothing they can do. Fire me. I don’t care,’ Cameron Jankowski of Fort Wayne said of the photo. Taco Bell took him up on his offer and he was relieved of duties immediately.","Unnamed Taco Bell employee photographed licking a stack of taco shells .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:40 EST, 4 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:17 EST, 4 June 2013 . Ohio State University President Gordon Gee announced his retirement and is downplaying the impact that his controversial comments about Roman Catholics at rival school Notre Dame had on his decision. The 69-year-old Gee cited his age, major upcoming planning changes at the university, his desire not to lose the university provost to another job along with the remarks as he explained why he is leaving. The comments that likely had a very large impact on his decision to leave were recorded at a meeting last year, where he was heard saying that Notre Dame was never invited to join the Big Ten conference because the university's priests were not good partners, joking that 'those damn Catholics' can't be trusted. In trouble: Ohio State University president Gordon Gee was heard in a recording joking that the priests at Notre Dame University 'can't be trusted' and that's why they were never accepted into the Big 10 conference . Gee acknowledges he is facing what he calls headwinds. Gee calls himself a 'quirky' person . who decided it was best to leave quickly- making his exit next month in . the middle of summer. Ohio State trustee chairman Robert . Schottenstein says Gee's decision is not about a letter trustees sent . him in March ordering him to watch his public remarks or about any . dwindling support on the board. At the fateful conference which was . held last December, Gee also took shots at schools in the Southeastern . Conference and the University of Louisville, according to the recording . of the December meeting of the school's Athletic Council that The . Associated Press obtained under a public records request. The university called the statements inappropriate and said Gee is undergoing a 'remediation plan' because of the remarks. Gee apologized in a statement released to the AP. All about football: Notre Dame (pictured) are rivals with Ohio State both because of skill and their proximity . 'The comments I made were just plain wrong, and in no way do they reflect what the university stands for,' he said. 'They were a poor attempt at humor and entirely inappropriate. There is no excuse for this and I am deeply sorry.' Gee, . who has taken heat previously for uncouth remarks, told members of the . council that he negotiated with Notre Dame officials during his first . term at Ohio State, which began more than two decades ago. 'The . fathers are holy on Sunday, and they're holy hell on the rest of the . week,' Gee said to laughter at the December 5 meeting attended by . Athletic Director Gene Smith and several other athletic department . members, along with professors and students. 'You just can't trust those damn Catholics on a Thursday or a Friday, and so, literally, I can say that,' said Gee, a Mormon. The . Big Ten had for years courted Notre Dame, but the school resisted as it . sought to retain its independent status in college football. In . September, the school announced that it would join the Atlantic Coast . Conference in all sports except football. It also agreed to play five . football games each year against ACC teams. In the recording, Gee referred . specifically to dealing with the Reverend Ned Joyce, Notre Dame's . longtime executive vice president, who died in 2004. 'Father Joyce was one of those people who ran the university for many, many years,' Gee said. Gee said the Atlantic Coast Conference added Notre Dame at a time when it was feeling vulnerable. 'Notre Dame wanted to have its cake and eat it, too,' Gee said, according to the recording and a copy of the meeting's minutes. Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Brown called the remarks regrettable, especially the reference to Joyce, 'who served Notre Dame and collegiate athletics so well and for so long.' Gee contacted Notre Dame's president, the Reverend John Jenkins, to offer an apology that was accepted, Brown said Thursday in an email. Ohio State trustees learned of . 'certain offensive statements' by Gee in January, met with the president . at length and created the remediation plan for Gee to 'address his . behavior,' board president Robert Schottenstein said in a statement. Comments . by a university leader about 'particular groups, classes of people or . individuals are wholly unacceptable,' Schottenstein said. 'These . statements were inappropriate, were not presidential in nature and do . not comport with the core values of the university.' Irish spirit: The Notre Dame mascot is a fiery leprechaun who symbolizes 'the fighting Irish' Gee . has gotten in trouble before for offhand remarks, most recently during a . memorabilia-for-cash and tattoos scandal that cost football coach Jim . Tressel his job. Tressel had known about allegations that players were . trading game paraphernalia for money and tattoos but didn't tell the . university. Gee was asked in . March 2011 whether he had considered firing Tressel. He responded: 'No, . are you kidding? Let me just be very clear: I'm just hopeful the coach . doesn't dismiss me.' Tressel stepped down three months later. In . November 2010, Gee boasted that Ohio State's football schedule didn't . include teams on par with the 'Little Sisters of the Poor.' An . apologetic Gee later sent a personal check to the real Little Sisters of . the Poor in northwest Ohio and followed up with a visit to the nuns . months later. Offending the Church: In the recording, Gee took a swipe at the former Notre Dame Vice President Rev. Ned Joyce who died in 2004 (left). He has since contacted Notre Dame's president Reverend John Jenkins (right), to offer an apology that was accepted . Last year, Gee apologized for . comparing the problem of coordinating the school's many divisions to the . Polish army, an off-the-cuff remark that a Polish-American group called . a 'slanderous' display of bigotry and ignorance. In 1992, in a moment of frustration . over higher education funding, Gee told a student newspaper reporter, . 'the governor's a damn dummy.' Then-Gov. George Voinovich laughed it off . and the two became allies in the push for more education dollars. Gee has one of the highest-profile resumes of any college president in recent history. He . has held the top job at West Virginia University, the University of . Colorado, Brown University and Vanderbilt University. He was Ohio State . president from 1990 to 1997, and returned in 2007. He earns about $1.9 . million annually in base pay, deferred and performance compensation and . retirement benefits.","Ohio State University president was overheard at a conference taking a swipe at the rival school's religious heritage .

The script has not even been written yet, but a film disputing the immaculate conception of Jesus is already causing controversy. Paul Verhoeven, who worked on the 1992 film Basic Instinct, will direct the film which will suggest that Jesus is not the son of God and instead he was conceived after his mother Mary was raped by a Roman soldier. The film will be based on Verhoeven's 2010 book, Jesus of Nazareth, which discounts the events commonly attributed to the life of Christ. Plot: The film will be based on Paul Verhoeven's (left) 2010 book, Jesus of Nazareth, which discounts the events commonly attributed to the life of Christ . Academy Award-winning Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary is reported to be adapting the book into a screenplay. The news has sparked accusations that the filmmaker is launching an attack on Christianity. 'Hollywood isn't anti-Christian, we are constantly told,' Dan Gainor of the Culture and Media Institute told RadarOnline. 'Yet the evidence keeps piling up that it is precisely that way.' Disputed: Passion Of The Christ (2004) is one of the most recent controversial films about Jesus. Starring Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ, some critics claimed that the extreme violence in the movie 'obscures its message' 'This isn't accidental. Christians . and Christian faith have been under decades of attack by hedonist . Hollywood that is desperate to rationalize a culture of immorality,' claimed Mr Gainor. The project has only been announced . this month and the cast has not been revealed so a representative for . Verhoeven told RadarOnline that any reaction is premature. 'There is as yet no script on the subject, and until there is, there's nothing to discuss. 'It will be at least six months before we have a script,' the director's spokesperson revealed to the website. Verhoeven, whose most recent project was 2006's Black Book, told Deadline last year that he respects what Jesus stands for. 'If you look at the man, it’s clear you have a person who was completely innovative in the field of ethics,' said Verhoeven. Criticised: Monty Python's Life of Brian contained themes of religious satire that were controversial. Left to right: Michael Palin, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones . 'My own passion for Jesus came when I . started to realize that. It’s not about miracles, it’s about a new set . of ethics, an openness towards the world, which was anathema in a . Roman-dominated world. 'Jesus’ ideals are about the utopia of human behavior, about how we should . treat each other, how we should step into the shoes of our enemy,' he . told the website. The . movie is one of several on the horizon based on Biblical figures, with . Darren Aronofsky currently considering a story about Noah's ark, and . Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg reported to be considering adaptations . of the life of Moses. There have been several films about Jesus' life which have caused controversy in the past. In 1979, Monty Python's Life of Brian  drew accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. Background: Paul Verhoeven, directed Basic Instinct (1992) starring Sharon Stone . The film contains themes of religious satire that were controversial at the time of its release. It tells the story of Brian Cohen - played by Graham Chapman- a young . Jewish man who is born on the same day as, and next door to, Jesus . Christ, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah. Thirty-nine local authorities in the UK either imposed an outright ban, or imposed a high age certificate. Another film which came in for criticism was the 1988 film The Last Temptation Of Christ. Directed by Martin Scorsese and shot in Morocco, it stars Willem Dafoe as Jesus and depicts him being tempted by imagining himself engaged in sexual activities, an idea that has caused outrage from some Christians. The movie includes a disclaimer explaining that it departs from the widely-accepted Biblical portrayal of Jesus' life, and that it is not based on the Gospels. Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ (2004) is one of the most recent controversial films. Starring Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ, it covers the final 12 hours of Jesus' life. Some critics claimed that the extreme violence in the movie 'obscures its message', while some Catholics questioned the authenticity of the non-biblical material the film claimed to have drawn upon.","Dutch director Paul Verhoeven will direct the project .

"By . Ap Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:17 EST, 4 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:18 EST, 4 June 2013 . Black people are arrested for marijuana possession four times more often than white people in the United States in 2010,  says an American Civil Liberties Union report.This, despite marijuana use by both races reported to be just about the same. The largest disparity was found in Iowa, where blacks were arrested 8.34 times more often for marijuana possession than whites in 2010. According to 2011 U.S. Census information, blacks make up just 3 percent of the state’s population. In Washington, D.C. blacks were arrested 8.05 times more often for pot possession, 7.81 times more often in Minnesota, 7.56 times more often in Illinois, and in Wisconsin blacks were arrested 5.98 more often for possessing the drug. Disparity: The ACLU released data Tuesday showing a huge disparity between blacks arrested for marijuana possession versus whites . Randall Wilson, legal director of ACLU Iowa attempted to temper the study’s findings as they pertain to his state. ‘Iowa has been a leading state among civil rights and should not rank as the worst in racial disparities in marijuana arrests,’ he told the Des Moines Register. ‘We all need to take responsibility—whether as citizens, police on the streets, or administrators.’ An increase in marijuana possession arrests from 2001 to 2010 is largely attributable to drastic increases in arrests of black people, the ACLU said. In New York City, the ‘stop-and-frisk’ law allows police to shake down anyone on the street they deem looks suspicious in what is labeled an effort to get illegal guns off the streets, but which, according New York Civil Liberties Union 2012 data, leads more marijuana-related arrests than for any other crime. The same data revealed that 87 percent of those who were interrogated under the law were black or latino. Quadruple: Overall in America, blacks are arrested four times as often as whites for marijuana possession . The ACLU's analysis of federal crime data, released Tuesday, found marijuana arrest rates for black people were 3.73 times greater than those for white people nationally in 2010. In some counties, the arrest rate was 10 to 30 times greater for blacks. In two Alabama counties, 100 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession were black, the ACLU said. When it comes to marijuana use, about 14 percent of black people and 12 percent of white people reported in 2010 that they had used the drug during the previous year, according to data that the ACLU obtained from the National Drug Health Survey, a Health and Human Services publication. Among younger people ages 18-25, use was greater among whites. Blacks were arrested at a rate of 537 per 100,000 people nationally in 2001. In 2010, their arrest rate rose to 716 per 100,000. The 2001 number for white people was 191 per 100,00 and rose to 192 per 100,000 in 2010, the ACLU said. Despite the disparate rates, far more whites were arrested for marijuana possession in 2010, 460,808 compared to blacks, 286,117. Hawkeyes: Broken down by state, the numbers are even grimmer, with Iowa as the worst offender. In that state, blacks are arrested for pot 8.34 more often than blacks . Ezekiel Edwards, lead author of the ACLU study, attributed the disparate arrest rates to racial profiling by police seeking to pad their arrest numbers with ‘low-level’ arrests in ‘certain communities that they have kind of labeled as problematic.’ ‘While this country moves in some ways in a more progressive direction on marijuana policy in a lot of places, in other places, people are getting handcuffed, jailed and getting criminal records at racially disparate rates all around the country,’ Edwards said. 2010 American Civil Liberties data shows . that black Americans are arrested about 4 times more . often than white Americans for marijuana possession. When . broken down by state, the discrepancy is often much higher -- even in . states where blacks make up just a small percentage of the population. Below are the states where data showed the discrepancy between white and . black arrests to be the highest alongside 2011 census data of those . same states' black population. In Iowa, blacks were 8.34 times more likely to be arrested than whites on marijuana charges in 2010. Population percentage of blacks in Iowa: 3.1 . In Washington DC, the numbers seem may seem a little less shocking. Blacks in the district were 8.05 times more likely to be arrested for . pot possession. Population percentage of blacks in DC: 50.7 . But in Minnesota, where blacks were 7.81 times more likely to be . arrested for marijuana possession, the numbers betray a huge discrepancy . once again. Population percentage of blacks in Minnesota: 5.4 . In Wisconsin, the story is about the same. There, blacks were 5.98 times as likely as whites to be arrested for possession. Population percentage of blacks in Wisconsin: 6.5 . Kentucky's discrepancy is large, too. In the Bluegrass State, blacks were arrested 5.95 times as often as whites. Population percentage of blacks in Kentucky: 8 . And in Pennsylvania, blacks were 5.19 times more likely to be arrested than whites. Population percentage of blacks in Pennsylvania: 11.3 . Police simply operate from the standpoint that ‘the use of marijuana is a crime,’ said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police. ‘We will try to educate our membership, to the extent the statistics are valid, to be aware (that) people other than blacks are smoking marijuana and to arrest them too,’ said Pasco, who had not yet seen the ACLU report. Arthur Burnett Sr., a retired judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, said his 40 years on the bench showed him that police concentrate their numbers in black communities. It's easier to catch people with marijuana in communities where there are ‘open-air’ drug markets, rather than looking in homes, basements or country clubs, said Burnett. He is the CEO of the National African American Drug Policy Coalition based in Washington. Burnett said some black defendants, distrustful of authorities, may lash out, use profanities or be rebellious — behavior that makes it more likely that an officer will make an arrest. Burnett said his coalition supports forming a commission to look at scientific evidence on the effect of marijuana use and ‘overcriminalization’ of it. The commission would determine whether to treat marijuana like tobacco, in which people are warned about consequences of its use. It would also examine the harshness of penalties for using pot. ‘We don't need to treat it like heroin and cocaine,’ Burnett said. The ACLU supports legalization of marijuana and regulation through taxation and licensing. It also supports eliminating criminal and civil penalties for marijuana possession. If those two options are not possible, the ACLU supports punishment for marijuana possession with only civil penalties, which is often referred to as decriminalizing marijuana possession. The unequal arrests rates are not confined to a single region of the U.S. or in urban areas with larger black populations, the ACLU said. That discrepancy is found throughout the country, regardless of the size of the black population of the location and at all income levels, the data shows. For example, in Morgan County, Ala., where African Americans represent 12 percent of the population and Pike County, Alabama, where 37 percent of the population is black, all those arrested for marijuana possession were black, the ACLU found. African Americans living in counties with the highest median household incomes, $85,000 to $115,000, are two to eight times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites. In counties with median household incomes of $22,000 to $30,000, the arrest rate for blacks is 1.5 times to five the rate as for whites, the report said. What gives? Some say blacks are more likely to be arrested as they often purchase pot in 'open air' areas, where whites are more likely do do so behind closed doors. Others blame racial profiling . Blacks face these greater chances for arrest for marijuana possession at a time when Colorado and Washington have legalized adult possession of small amounts of nonmedical marijuana, while a number of states and Washington, D.C. allow medical marijuana. Federal law still prohibits its use. Some states and some cities have eased punishments for possession of smaller amounts. The findings are hardly surprising to the African American community. Ben Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP, said arrest disparities like those for marijuana possession have led to mass incarceration and criminalization of African Americans, which in turn, has become the new Jim Crow, referring to laws that sanctioned racial segregation in schools and public facilities. ‘Any arrest, even for marijuana, is a blot on someone's record and an impediment to future jobs and opportunities,’ Jealous said. ‘For these reasons, a number of NAACP state conferences (chapters) have supported the decriminalization of marijuana.’","The American Civil Liberties Union compiled the 2010 marijuana arrest data and released the report Tuesday .

They say that you should always leave them laughing, and one smooth-talking war veteran who died last month has certainly raised at least a wry smile after his hilarious self-penned obituary became an internet sensation. John E. Holden's witty eulogy to himself describes a life of 'endless laughter and debauchery.' Posted on the Lancaster Online website, the tribute has sparked a flurry of tributes from strangers who say that they wish they had gotten to know John, who was known to his friends as Jack. Jack's tribute opens with a laugh as he describes himself as having taken the 'Deep Six', but it goes on to acknowledge his heroics as a Marine fighter pilot in the Second World War and tells readers that he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his combat activities and the Air Medal for action in Okinawa in 1945. The mirthful obit adds that Jack was also awarded the 'Distinguished Fleeing Cross for avoiding numerous women who were seeking child support under unproven circumstances.' Jack, a former employee of Armstrong Cork and the Hubley Toy Company and later an independent toy designer, is described as a longstanding member of the Lancaster Country Club and the Hamilton Club. He says he was banned however, from the International Mickey Mouse Club after 'providing housing for a number of stray cats.' Mr Holden also turned his hand to entertaining fellow residents, or inmates as he called them, of his retirement village, publishing 'The Wrinkle Valley News' for many years before his death.

Holden, alias Jack, took the Deep Six, Monday, May 27, 2013 at the Willow Valley Retirement Community after a life filled with endless laughter and debauchery. While flying his beloved Corsair as a Marine Fighter Pilot during WWII he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his combat activities, the Air Medal for action in Okinawa in 1945 and the Distinguished Fleeing Cross for avoiding numerous women who were seeking child support under unproven circumstances. After WWII, he spent eight years with the Armstrong Cork Company and resigned with the title of Assistant Director of Advertising plus a dinky pension. He then joined the Hubley Toy Company and later became an independent toy designer. He was a longstanding member of the Lancaster Country Club, the Hamilton Club and the International Mickey Mouse Club from which he was immediately banned after providing housing for a number stray cats. For many years prior to his demise, he wrote a tongue-in-cheek publication at Willow Valley called 'The Wrinkle Valley News' where he had close to a thousand readers whom he referred to as 'The Inmates of Wrinkle Valley.' They fully enjoyed his creative humor and his intention to help them make unwise decisions in their hectic lives. Jack was widowed 10 years ago after sixty-one years of marriage to Elaine Ewing Holden.  He has had a number of other wives recently, none of which were his. Three daughters, Holly, Wendy and Anne Holden and a son, John E. Holden, Jr., have managed to survive despite being related to their father.  His last words were 'I’m really going to miss myself.'

On the anniversary of Kevin Fox's death his family were able to feel his heart beat once more after meeting the man who received the teenager's heart. In a list of 50 things he wanted to achieve in his life, the 18-year-old who died alongside three of his school friends, had written of his desire to donate his organs to help someone else - a wish that his family honored. 'I can’t even put into words to sum up how I felt,' Colleen Fox said, after meeting the 49-year-old man who was given her brother's heart. Gift of life: The family of Kevin Fox donated his heart after the teenager died in a car crash with three friends . Anthony Hughes, a former employee of the Veterans Administration in Chicago, is overjoyed at a second chance of life, after being given the teenager's heart. 'Sometimes I’m just lost for words,' he told Fox 8. 'I’m just so happy you know ... that I am able to live again due to Kevin J. Fox.' The teenager, who had wanted to be a firefighter like his father, was involved in the fatal crash hours before he was due to graduate from Brunswick High School. The car being driven by his friend Jeffrey Chaya,18, rolled and crashed into a tree after 'jumping' an elevated railway line. Kevin was thrown from the car and died the following morning. His 16-year-old girlfriend Lexie Poerner, Blake Bartchak, 17, and Jeffrey died at the scene of the crash. Another girl, Julia Romito, 17, survived. Mr Hughes said at first he found it difficult to think about the crash that killed Kevin, but gave him a second chance at life. From the moment he woke up . in hospital, Mr Hughes said he felt different, as if a part of Kevin had become a part of him. Second chance: Anthony Hughes at the hospital where he was given Kevin's heart . Life saver: In a list of 50 things he wanted to achieve in his life, Kevin had opted to be an organ donor . 'This . is his heart in me so he is a part of me, and I’m a part of everything . that revolves around him. That’s why I’m here,' Mr Hughes, who hopes . their story will generate support for organ donation, said. Colleen described meeting Mr Hughes as 'overwhelming'. 'It’s amazing to think that this person has Kevin’s . heart inside him, and I got to feel his chest and got to feel Kevin’s . heart beat,' she told Fox 8. 'To see that my brother saved this person’s life, it’s . truly amazing. I’m so proud of him. He wanted to be an organ donor the day he got his license.' Kevin's family hope that part of his legacy will be that even more lives will be saved. 'They . say everything happens for a reason. I don’t know that reason yet,'  Colleen said. 'If these four angels, if they helped stop somebody . else from losing their lives, maybe that was part of their purpose.' Proud: Colleen Fox says it was overwhelming to feel her brother's heart beating inside Anthony Hughes . Mr Hughes also attended a memorial service for the teenagers on June 3, according to Cleveland.com. Since Kevin's death the family have tried to fulfill other items on the teenager's bucket list, which he created for a school project. In July last year, his brother Liam threw the first pitch for the Indians, the baseball team he supported. His mother, Sherri, said at the time: 'I think he would be smiling, he would be very happy, and he would be very proud that we’re doing this.' The Ohio Department of Transportation, and local elected officials, have received federal funding to lower the road where the teenagers died.","Family overwhelmed at chance to feel son's heart beat again .

A dwarf died after his friend spiked his beer with 27 anti-depressant tablets for 'a joke' which went wrong, a court heard. Lee Webster, 26, is accused of slipping the 30mg Mirtazapine tablets into Jason Wood's can while he left the room to go to the toilet. Mr Wood, 30, who was four foot tall, came back and remarked 'my beer tastes funny' but Webster told him to 'just drink it' and three hours later he was dead, the jury was told. 'Joke gone wrong': Jason Wood, 30, died after his beer was spiked with 27 anti-depressant tablets, a court was told . He was found slumped in an armchair at the house in Ramsgate, Kent, by friend Ian Sherringham who tried in vain to revive him. Maidstone Crown Court heard that Webster . kept quiet about what he had done until a month later when he confessed that he had spiked the drink. 'Victim': Mr Wood, 30, was discovered dead in a chair at the property in Ramsgate, Kent . He told his father Stephen Allen he had put the tablets in Mr Wood's beer and ‘may have accidentally killed him’. And the Crown claims he told his sister Stephanie he had spiked the drink because he ‘thought it would be a laugh’. The court also heard that Mr Wood's sister Tracey, 38, befriended Webster on Facebook and he told her: 'Tracey, I am so sorry. I put 27 of my mirtazapine tablets into Jason’s beer that night.' A post-mortem found that the victim, . who weighed just six stone, had consumed an amount of mirtazapine that . had proved fatal in others. Anthony Haycroft, prosecuting, said: 'He (Webster) accepted putting the pills into Jason’s beer. He said it was done as a joke. 'There . is no suggestion he did anything intending to kill Jason. It may well . have been done as a joke but we have to look at the consequences of . that.' Oliver Saxby QC, . defending, said: 'It was pretty obvious it was a stupid thing to do. They were friends, they were good mates. He didn’t intend to cause harm. Some hours later the friend was found dead.' However, . the defence barrister said the critical question for the jury was . whether the tablets were the cause of Mr Wood's death. Mr Saxby added: 'He (the defendant) can’t help you with that, so you won’t be hearing from him. You won’t be deprived of hearing what he has said about what he has done. 'It is not a question of gagging him. It is simply how can he assist with this crucial question? 'Questions to be answered were how toxic the drug was and could a person be given 27 of the tablets and survive? 'Or is it the case if you are given them you are likely to die? I think we will hear that is not the case.' Mr Saxby said it was possible to die from the amount of alcohol Mr Wood had in his system. Death: Mr Wood was drinking with friends in this house in Ramsgate, Kent, when he allegedly had the anti-depressant tablets slipped into his beer . He said it was possible he could have died from a combination of sleep apnoea and too much alcohol. He added: 'If that is correct, the Crown may be in difficulty in proving that mirtazapine played a requisite part in his death.' Mr . Wood was confirmed dead at a house in Ramsgate, Kent, where he had gone . to drink with friends Webster, Steve McNamara and Ian Sherringham who . lived there. Mr Sherringham said Mr Wood, Mr Webster and a friend called Steven McNamara had been drinking strong lager and cider on the night in question. He . went back on October 22 and saw Mr Wood was lying in an armchair with . his head back and appeared to be asleep. There were a lot of empty beer . cans. Mr Sherringham said: 'I didn’t wake him as when he is awoken after drinking he gets annoyed. 'I went downstairs and fed the dog and . watched TV. I thought something wasn’t right because Jason wasn’t . snoring and he does quite loudly. I touched his hand. It was cold, like . being in the freezer.' Accused: Webster, 26, who is standing trial at Maidstone Crown Court, is accused of manslaughter and also faces an alternative charge of administering poison or noxious substance as to endanger life . Mr Sherringham said he called his ex-girlfriend and Mr Wood’s sister Tracey West and she told him to splash water over his face. Nothing happened, so he threw all the water over him. He called for an ambulance and was told to try CPR on Mr Wood. He did so until paramedics arrived, but Mr Wood was later pronounced dead. Mr Sherringham said he received a message form Webster on Facebook saying: 'I am sorry, I gave Jason 27 tablets in his beer.' Webster asked him on the telephone what he should do and Mr Sherringham said he told him he should hand himself in, the court heard. Webster, from Gravesend, Kent, is accused of manslaughter and also faces an alternative charge of administering poison or . noxious substance as to endanger life. He denies the charges.

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 10:35 EST, 4 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:36 EST, 4 June 2013 . Back in court: Former Army captain Brian Witty, 42, is accused of raping three women who came forward after hearing he had been convicted of other rapes . A notorious serial rapist who was jailed last year has denied the rape of three other women who came forward after his highly-publicised trial. Former Territorial Army captain Brian Witty, 42, is accused of raping the women when they were all 19 year-old students. One of his alleged victims claims he raped her and then left with a smug look on his face as though something funny had happened. Prosecutor Edmund Gritt told Kingston Crown Court: 'They describe him as somebody who is charming, confident on the verge of arrogance, violent and takes sex by force, using his physical strength if he is refused.' The jury were told City banker Witty, who served in the Parachute Regiment, had previously been convicted at the same court of three rapes and one sexual assault of four victims last year. They were told the media coverage of the trial prompted three new alleged victims to come forward after years of silence. Witty, of Twickenham Road, Teddington, has pleaded not guilty to raping the women. He is accused of raping one of the complainants, who is now a 43 year-old dentist, at her Liverpool University hall of residence room in September or October in 1989. Witty is alleged to have raped the second victim, now a 35 year-old nurse, at a Hull address in in December, 1997. The third alleged victim, who is now a doctor aged 35, claims she was raped by Witty at his former Kensington flat in the early hours of New Year's Day in 1998. Historical: The City financier is accused of raping the women when they were 19-year-old students . The court heard Witty knew the first . woman, who he met at Hull College of Further Education where she was . retaking her A-levels, and became angry when she stood him up in . Liverpool where she had moved to study dentistry. 'Her first impression was that he was charming, fun and engaging, but also cocky and very confident,' explained Mr Gritt. 'She soon discovered that Mr. Witty's personality had a different side that was intimidating, jealous and violent.' A witness once saw Witty twisting the student's arm until she said sorry to him for a joke he was offended by. The court heard he also beat her and parked outside her family's home in Hull to intimidate them. After she moved to Liverpool he tracked her down and turned up at her lodgings. 'She was terrified, he held the door . open, punched her and forced her back into the room,' said Mr Gritt. 'He . punched her repeatedly all over and she curled herself into a ball to . protect herself. Notorious rapist: Brian Witty, who served in the Parachute Regiment and is pictured in his Army uniform, was convicted of three rapes and one sexual assault at Kingston Crown Court last year . Previous: The court was told Witty had committed a rape before the alleged offences he is currently being tried for - and was 'confident' after being released by police without charge . 'He sat on top of her, holding her down, and at one point put his hands around her neck. 'He pulled down her lower clothing and raped her. He was very strong and she was very frightened. 'Afterwards he started punching her again and she began screaming. The defendant continued shouting and hitting her and was enraged that she did not meet up with him.' She was left with a bleeding eye and lip and with bruising to her face and body, but only told people Witty had beaten her up. The jury were told the second victim . was staying overnight on a living-room sofa at an address in Hull where . Witty and a couple were also staying at. Violent: The court heard Brian Witty initially came across as charming but then became jealous and violent . 'There in the small hours she was woken . by this defendant, pulling her to the floor and he held her down and put . his hand over her mouth,' said Mr Gritt. 'He was much stronger and she was frozen with fear and this defendant then raped her. 'He said nothing, but simply looked smug and he stood up with a smirk on his face as if something funny had just happened.' Again the victim did not report the rape and the jury were reminded Witty had raped before this date and was 'confident' after being released without charge when arrested and questioned by police. Days later, Witty was celebrating the new year in London and agreed to look after a medical student, who was attending Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, and could not get back home to Romford, Essex. 'Her friend fatefully introduced her to Mr Witty as somebody who would look after her and eliminate the risk of her getting raped on the way home. 'The defendant reassured her that he did not have any ulterior motive, but sex was all that was on his mind and she thought he was the perfect gentleman.' The jury were told his Kensington flat had been the scene of a previous rape where Witty had again attacked a lone female once he got her inside. 'He pushed her face-down on the bed, holding her arms above her, spread her legs and raped her,' said Mr Gritt. 'She was shocked and scared and did not know what to do.' The young woman told her tutor, doctor and friends about the rape and they noticed bruising to both her arms, the court heard, but again the police were not informed. Like the other two complainants, she only went to the police after learning of Witty's convictions. The trial continues.

The latest temporary pavilion for London's Serpentine Gallery was unveiled today, resembling a huge white climbing frame. Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto is the 13th designer to create a new structure for the art venue gallery. The steel lattice, constructed in London's Kensington Gardens, looks like it is built from a huge set of the spacers used for tiling, although it is actually made up of three-quarter-inch poles. Cloud-like: Sou Fujimoto stands upon his giant creation at the Serpentine Gallery, the latest temporary installation for the gallery's pavilion . A journalist shows how to interact with the installation which was unveiled today in central London's Kensington Gardens . Fujimoto talked about how the new structure was designed to be 'cloud-like' as he unveiled his plans when he landed the commission for the annual architecture challenge earlier this year. The building will stay up for four months. Previous designers have included Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and architect Zaha Hadid. At aged 41, Fujimoto is the youngest architect to accept the invitation to design a temporary structure for the Serpentine Gallery. Sou Fujimoto is the 'leading light of an exciting generation of artists who are re-inventing our relationship with the built environment,' according to a gallery statement. Occupying some 357 square-meters of lawn in front of the Serpentine Gallery, 41-year-old Fujimoto's structure of 20mm steel poles features a cafe and visitors will be encouraged to enter and interact with the piece in different ways .

The majority of Fujimoto's buildings are in Japan, with commissions ranging from the domestic, such as Final Wooden House, T House and House N, to the institutions such as the Musashino Art Museum and Library at Musashino Art University. Occupying 350 square-metres of lawn in front of the gallery, 'Fujimoto's delicate, latticed structure of 20mm steel poles will have a lightweight and semi-transparent appearance that will allow it to blend, cloud-like, into the landscape and against the classical backdrop of the gallery's colonnaded East wing' the centre says.

Visitors will be encouraged to enter and interact with the Pavilion in different ways throughout its four-month tenure in London's Kensington Gardens. Gallery Director Julia Peyton-Jones, and Hans Ulrich Obrist, Co-Director, said they were 'thrilled to be working with one of the most fascinating architects in the world today'. They described Fujimoto as a 'visionary, who has conceived an extraordinary response to our invitation to design the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion'. Describing his design concept, Sou Fujimoto, quoted by the gallery, said: 'For the 2013 Pavilion I propose an architectural landscape: a transparent terrain that encourages people to interact with and explore the site in diverse ways.

They are now appealing to the public to help return the Teddy, named Bristol by staff, to his rightful owner. 'He's well-loved, that is for sure', said Jacqui Mills, spokeswoman for Bristol Airport. 'He looks a bit battered but I think that's because he has been given so many cuddles over the years. The antique bear was found in a bag with a black and white photo dated March 1918 . 'He was with lost property and we were certain that someone would claim him, but when they didn't he was passed over to the airport police who took very good care of him and tried every means possible to find his family.'

'I cannot say it's a Steiff without looking at it in person but in its current condition even with the lovely photo is is worth about £350. If we could confirm it was a Steiff it would be worth considerably more.' If the make was a Steiff, Mr Pearson said it could be worth more than £1,000. ‘Collectors always love bears with provenance, and a nice photo of a young owner with their bear is always much sought after,' he said. 'Steiff were certainly the most famous maker of bears before the First World War but certainly not the only one. 'Many of these early factories left few records to help identify the bears they made.

A 'greedy and dishonest' stadium manager at Birmingham City FC who invented imaginary stewards to cover Premier League matches has been jailed for conning the club out of £45,000. Scheming Peter Smith, 63, fleeced thousands while working for the Blues by putting his family on the payroll and inventing 'ghost' stewards over a three year period. A court heard the fraudster added his wife, sons and daughter-in-in law to the payroll at St Andrews between December 2009 and April 2012. Former Birmingham City FC employee Peter Smith was jailed for conning the club out of £45,000 . He also made up another imaginary steward - by the name of Paul Knowles - and paid those wages into his account to help clear debts and his mortgage. Birmingham Crown Court heard the club were alerted to the suspicious transactions during an internal audit in April 2012, the year after they were relegated to the Championship. They contacted West Midlands Police who launched an investigation and found payments had been made to staff who had never carried out their stadium duties. Specialist fraud investigators probed the club's payroll and uncovered a number of false employment documents. They also found Smith's wife had never even set foot inside the football stadium, while his two sons and daughter-in-law were on the payroll despite not having any steward training and qualifications. Smith, from Perton near Wolverhampton, West Midlands, admitted fraud by abuse of position and was yesterday jailed for 18 months. A court heard the fraudster added his wife, sons and daughter-in-in law to the payroll at St Andrews between December 2009 and April 2012 . Detective Constable Catherine Dell, from West Midlands Police, said after the case: 'This was a fraud driven by greed and Smith's frustration that, at the age of 63, he still had a sizeable mortgage. 'Smith began by putting his wife, using her maiden name, on the books and paying wages into his bank account. 'He clearly thought it was easy money and became more audacious by inventing an employee called Paul Knowles and charging the club for steward services. 'This was a blatant abuse of position: he put family members down on attendance lists and signed off their time sheets, including overtime, even though there's no evidence they did any work at the club. 'We scrutinised the payroll for up to 70 matches and corporate club events and when we put the evidence to Smith he was left with no option but to admit the fraud.' Smith's assets have since been frozen by police who will look to recover the stolen cash through the Proceeds of Crime Act. Angela Millington, senior prosecutor for West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), added: 'Peter Smith was employed by Birmingham City Football Club as their Safety Officer, a job which involved the club putting a lot of trust in him as he had the responsibility of ensuring the safety and welfare of fans and club officials. 'However, Smith grossly exploited his position of trust and abused his senior position in order to dishonestly receive over £45,000 which was used to enrich himself and his family. 'He exploited the club's employment practices for greed and self-importance, but he has paid the penalty for his abuse of the club's trust. A Birmingham City FC spokesman, said: 'We are pleased with the outcome. 'The club would like to thank West Midlands Police and the CPS for their thorough investigation. 'This case was prompted by an internal investigation by management staff at the club and no stone was left unturned. 'It is particularly pleasing all of the hard work, dedication and professionalism carried out behind the scenes have resulted in today's judgement.'","Peter Smith, 63, fleeced thousands by putting his family on the payroll .

A teacher accused of sexually touching girls in his class was known at his school as 'Mr Perv', according to one of his alleged victims. Science teacher Christopher Hird, 47, went on trial today accused of sexual misconduct with three girls at a secondary school in East Yorkshire. One of them was 11 years old at the time of the alleged incident. Prosecutor Simon Waley told a jury at Hull Crown Court how each of the allegations involved 'brief and subtle' touching but said Hird 'was someone they should, of course, have been able entirely to trust'. On trial: Science teacher Christopher Hird, who is accused of sexual assaults on pupils . Mr Waley said: 'Although they were brief and subtle, they are clearly touchings that have upset and stayed with the girls concerned.' The jury of six men and six women was told the first girl who came forward alleged Hird had touched her twice during lessons, in separate incidents in 2011 and 2012. She was 15 years old when she said it first happened. In the first incident, she said, the teacher wiped ink from her face, stroking her in a way she found 'quite disturbing'. She claimed he pressed himself up against her in a unnecessary way. In the second, she said, Hird came up behind her in the classroom when she asked a question. She said he pressed himself against her, put his hand on her side and slide it up and down. The prosecutor said Hird also placed his hand on the chair between the girl's legs. When the incident was reported, the school told police about another allegation that had been made about Hird in 2009. Mr Waley said this girl, who was 16 years old at the time, told police Hird was known among pupils for blatantly staring at girls' chests and was known at school as 'Mr Perv'. Hull Crown Court, where Hird is on trial accused of sex offences . She accused Hird of brushing his hand against the side of her breast in class. Mr Waley said: 'She was so upset about what happened, she decided to drop Chemistry as a subject.' The court was told that a third girl came forward after Hird was charged with offences and a story about the case appeared in a newspaper. This girl said she was 11 years old at the time and in her first week at the school, Mr Waley told the jury. According to the prosecutor, she claimed the teacher stood behind her and touched her inappropriately as he removed a piece of paper she had been sitting on. He said Hird also ran his hand down her hair braid and stroked her face saying: 'Did you think it was a spider?' Mr Waley said Hird denied any misconduct during his interviews with police. In relation to the girl who came forward after reading the newspaper report, the prosecutor said Hird remarked: 'When you think I have taught thousands and thousands of students, then it's open season.' He said the defendant suggested the girl may be motivated by compensation. The court heard that Hird has been a teacher for 24 years. Dressed in a suit, he sat in the dock listening to the prosecution opening statement. He has pleaded not guilty to four charges. Hird denies indecently assaulting an 11-year-old girl between August 31, 2000 and October 1, 2000. He denies sexually assaulting a girl between February 1, 2009 and February 8, 2009.

The 61-year-old has accused the FCO of 'destroying his career' A former diplomat has won £320,000 damages after the Foreign Office suspended him when he was wrongly accused of touching the bottom of a senior politician's wife. John Yapp was 'our man in Belize' until he was suspended in 2008 after his superiors confronted him with the allegation made by an opposition politician from the commonwealth state. Last month, the High Court ruled that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) was wrong to suspend him from his post as High Commissioner with immediate effect - a decision that ultimately cost him his ambassadorial role and destroyed his working life. The 61-year-old today accused the FCO of 'destroying his career' after the government agreed to pay him £320,000 - along with the six-figure legal costs of the case. Mr Yapp accused the FCO of trying to 'outspend' him with taxpayers' cash during the legal battle as he celebrated Mr Justice Cranston's order that he should receive £150,000 up front towards his legal bills. The court heard Mr Yapp was summoned before an FCO mandarin while on leave in June 2008 and hit with accusations that he had a 'bullying' management style and 'displayed inappropriate behaviour towards women at social functions'. It emerged that the claims of inappropriate behaviour arose from a Belize politician who claimed that Mr Yapp touched his wife's rear at a social gathering. The accusation - branded 'unfounded and scurrilous' by Mr Yapp's QC, Jane McNeill - was ultimately rejected after an FCO disciplinary probe. But, by then, it was too late to reinstate Mr Yapp in the Central American state and in subsequent years he found himself increasingly sidelined in professional terms. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (London office pictured) will pay £320,000 in damages and a further £150,000 on account of Mr Yapp's legal costs bills . His lawyers argued the conduct of the FCO showed a complete lack of consideration for the welfare of a loyal employee. The sexual misconduct allegations were eventually found to be baseless; however, the nature of his withdrawal, led to media intrusion and caused immense distress to Mr Yapp and his family. As a result Mr Yapp never returned to work and in due course had to retire after a long period of sick leave. The Prime Minister of Belize, the Hon. Dean Barrow was a witness in the case. He described Mr Yapp as 'one of the best High Commissioners we have had in Belize. I found him to be a consummate diplomat: intelligent, well-informed and an entertaining host'. He added that he and his wife, Kim Simplis Barrow, count Mr Yapp as a personal friend who they were pleased to have at their wedding in 2009. Other senior members of the local and expatriate communities in Belize praised Mr Yapp equally highly and he has been particularly warmly welcomed back to Belize in recent years by his many friends there, including amongst the remaining local staff of the British High Commission. The Prime Minister of Belize and other senior members of the local and expatriate communities in the country praised Mr Yapp highly . Speaking after the hearing, Mr Yapp said: 'It has been a long battle to clear my name and naturally I'm pleased, as are my whole family, that the judgment has gone in my favour and indeed today's orders have gone as we asked. 'I would just say that it seems very unfair that one of the offices of state is using and continuing to use taxpayers' money to outspend an individual. 'It is more than ironic that the Government is abolishing legal aid for civil actions and yet it is using taxpayers' money to try and destroy me and in the full knowledge that my health can not begin to recover until it is over. 'To have my career at its pinnacle and my future prospects destroyed so wrongly and, it seems, on a whim, made me unwell and I have had to go through this for five years now.' Mr Yapp, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said the FCO's failure to back him triggered a major mental breakdown, leaving him depressed and unable to work. He argued that superiors failed to 'hear his side of the story' before imposing the suspension, despite his 40 years' service as a diplomat, including previous tenure at the High Commissioner in the Seychelles. Last month, Mr Justice Cranston ruled that the FCO 'acted in breach of contract and in breach of its duty of care in withdrawing Mr Yapp from his post without affording him fair treatment' and that the ex-diplomat was entitled to compensation for his resulting losses. Today, the judge approved an agreed order whereby Mr Yapp will receive £320,000 damages. The FCO will also pay £150,000 on account of Mr Yapp's legal costs bills, which have yet to be finally assessed and could be much greater than that. Alan Payne, for the FCO, said it planned to challenge the judge's ruling in the Court of Appeal. John Yapp's solicitor, John Kings, said outside court during the case: 'My client is naturally pleased that justice has prevailed after what have been five long and hard - and very costly - years. 'He wishes to thank his wife Anne in particular, for her unswerving love and support throughout; his legal team for seeing at the outset the apparent injustice of his treatment in terms of the law, and for working so hard to address this; each and every one of his witnesses whose belief in justice was very evident; and his many friends and well wishers in Belize, in the UK, and indeed literally across the world. 'I hope that the FCO will be investigating the matter with those responsible for the decisions so wrongly made and taking action in order to ensure that such blatantly unfair and damaging treatment is not repeated.'","John Yapp, 61, accused of touching the bottom of senior politician's wife .

Sensible: One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson said all Labour party members should support an EU referendum . One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson today led calls for Labour leader Ed Miliband to offer an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. The Victor Meldrew star insisted to any ‘sensible’ party member would back the idea – which Mr Miliband has ruled out. The leadership is warned it risks looking ‘undemocratic’ and ready to ‘ignore’ core supporters by a new campaign called Labour for a Referendum. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with Brussels before staging an in-out vote by the end of 2017. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly rejected the idea, warning years of uncertainty over Britain’s place in Europe risks deterring investors and damaging the economy. The Labour for a referendum is being spear-headed by leading party donor John Mills, who warned Mr Miliband’s refusal to support a referendum is ‘unwise’. More than 150 Labour councillors and MPs have backed the campaign, arguing it is vital to Mr Miliband’s hopes of becoming Prime Minister in 2015. TV star Mr Wilson, a long-standing Labour supporter, said: ‘Any sensible Labour Party member should support Labour for a Referendum, as a pro-European I want to put the issue to bed once and for all.’ Today Mr Mills – who last week said Labour was policy-light - said he would vote to leave the EU in the present circumstances. But . he backed Prime Minister David Cameron's plan for a renegotiation of . the UK's relationship with Brussels followed by a referendum before then . end of 2017, saying it was ""not an unreasonable stance at all"". The . millionaire, who has given Labour £1.65 million in shares this year, . told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I think the Labour Party would be . unwise to rule out having a referendum before the run-up to the next . general election. A lot can happen over the next two years.’ He . added that he wanted a vote ‘the sooner the better’ because . ‘uncertainty about whether Britain is going to stay in the EU or not is . bad for business and bad generally’. Campaign: Mr Wilson has been a long-standing public backer of the Labour party, pictured last year with Ed Miliband (right) supporting Ken Livingstone to be Mayor of London . Mr Mills also raised concerns about Labour's economic policies, claiming none of the three main parties offered a clear solution to the UK's current problems. He said: ‘There is a general problem in this country, which is that none of the parties I believe - the Conservative Party or the Lib Dems or the Labour Party - have got a very clear idea about how to get the economy to grow more robustly or to get unemployment down. ‘I think that in the speech that Ed Balls made yesterday a number of proposals which are positive were produced. ‘But I think that there is still a danger that we are going to finish up, if we are not very careful, with 10 years or so or perhaps longer, of austerity and no growth and this seems to me to be a very daunting prospect.’ Clash: Labour leader Ed Miliband has warned David Cameron's plan to stage a referendum by 2017 would create uncertainty and damage the economy . But Mr Mills said he supported Mr Miliband 'very strongly' and would continue to back Labour. The Labour for a Referendum group has the support of several senior MPs including former Europe minister Keith Vaz. Graham Stringer, Blackley and Broughton, said: ‘2010 was a low point for Labour support, I remember the 1983 election, the last time we got so few votes, and before that it was 1918. We should not and cannot afford to ignore our core supporters.’ Jim Dowd, MP for Lewisham West and Penge,  said: ‘I have been a supporter of this cause for many years and firmly believe the Labour Party must commit to a referendum before the European elections next year. ‘As the Tories tear themselves apart over this issue, Labour for a Referendum provides the opportunity to unite the party on giving the people a say on our future in the EU.’ A Labour party source said: 'We don;t think it is right now to call for a referendum for five years hence. We think it exposes our economy to uncertainty.'","Richard Wilson says any 'sensible' party member would support a vote .

A Labour-run council has been accused of ‘petty politics’ after launching a last-minute bid to block a private school’s pioneering plan to become an academy. Kings School, which charges £10,000 a year, wants to merge with a nearby state primary when it changes its status at the end of this term. But the historic move is in doubt after North Tyneside Council decided to seek a judicial review, nine months after it learned of the scheme. It claims a statutory consultation process was not conducted properly. Row: King's School in Tynemouth wanted to merge with other local schools but the Labour-run council has opposed it . David Bilton, the chairman of the trust that would run the new school, yesterday branded the legal challenge a ‘cynical move designed to cause the maximum anxiety’. He added: ‘To put petty politics ahead of peoples’ wishes and children’s future education is thoroughly reprehensible. ‘At a time when the local authority is seeking to justify cuts in services, it is surprising that they regard the inevitable expense of seeking a judicial review in these circumstances as a proper use of council tax.’ Tory councillors complained the move was ‘ideologically’ driven to deny ordinary people access to an elite school. Group leader Judith Wallace said: ‘The Labour party is ideologically opposed to independent schools - although hypocritically, both locally and nationally, a number of Labour politicians do choose to send their own children to them’. Other fee-paying schools have previously applied to become academies. Many have seen pupil numbers fall as a result of the recession. But Kings School, in the seaside village of Tynemouth, is understood to be the first to include a local state primary in the process. The mixed school for four to 19-year-olds, which was founded in 1860 and whose former pupils include Stan Laurel and England and Leicester Tigers rugby player Toby Flood, has lost around a third of its pupils in recent years. Kings School takes pupils from four to 18 years old and its motto is Moribus Civilis - ‘behave properly’. Old boys:  Film star Stan Laurel and England Rugby ace Toby Flood both attended the King's School which wants to become part of an academy . Senior figures at Woodards Schools, a registered charity which runs a group of Anglican schools including Kings, decided to apply to become an academy. This allows it to continue to be run independently while being backed by taxpayers’ money instead of fees. The plans included merging with nearby Priory Primary School, which was rated outstanding in its last Ofsted inspection. The new school, called Kings Priory Academy, would continue to run on both sites but would be operated by the Woodard Academies Trust. A total of 1,425 places would be available with maximum class sizes of 25. Details were announced in September last year and the school is already heavily oversubscribed. But the plans are in jeopardy after North Tyneside Council, which has had to make savings of £40 million over the past four years, claimed the consultation had not included ‘appropriate’ people with an interest. Parents with children already in the schools were consulted and 90 per cent were in favour of the change. But the council says parents with children at other schools in the area should have been asked for their opinions. Elected Labour mayor Norma Redfearn said: ‘The council has a responsibility to ensure that all children and young people in North Tyneside can access the highest quality education. ‘The impact of the proposed Kings Priory Academy on the wider schools system in North Tyneside has not been properly considered.’ Mr Bilton insisted the legal threat would not derail the merger and said it would be up and running by the start of the autumn term.","King's School in Tynemouth wants to be an academy with local schools .

Royal Bank of Scotland would be broken up into a good bank and a bad bank under radical plans to be considered by George Osborne. Toxic loans which might never be repaid would be placed in the ‘bad’ arm while the profitable business could be sold off under proposals expected to be set out by a powerful commission of MPs and peers. However, the Chancellor is understood to be ready to resist the idea, preferring to sell off the taxpayer-backed bank even if it means making a loss. Split: A powerful commission of MPs and peers is reportedly planning to call for Royal Bank of Scotland to broken up into a good and bad bank . The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards is set to back the idea of splitting RBS, according to the BBC. The UK government owns 82 per cent of RBS, after the £66billion bailout in 2008 which also took a 39 per cent stake in Lloyds. Mr Osborne is prepared to sell the Government’s at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in British history. Allies hope the sell-off could come before the 2015 general election to give the public a chance to take a stake in the lenders. A long-awaited report from the Commission was sent to its members in the last week and they have until Monday to read it through, with a final report due by the end of the month. George Osborne has warned of 'very considerable obstacles' to the idea of splitting RBS . However, Mr Osborne has warned of ‘very considerable obstacles’ to the idea, which would involve spending up to £9billion in taxpayers’ money to buy up shares the government does not yet own. However outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King has supported the idea of a break-up. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson, who sits on the Commission, argued that nationalisation followed by a split would enable the Government to boost lending and re-privatise the ‘good’ bank more quickly. And Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has asked whether the Government’s ‘lack of will to break up the banks’ was a ‘recipe for a repetition of the disasters of the last few years’. RBS itself has claimed it is well on the road to recovery, despite reporting losses of £5.2 billion for 2012, driven by a £390 million settlement for rate-fixing, £1.1 billion provision for mis-selling and IT glitches. Yesterday it emerged RBS shrunk its net lending by £1.6 billion from January to March this year, but has borrowed £750 million from the Funding for Lending scheme designed to boost loans to businesses. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said on presenting full-year results that the institution’s recovery would be ‘substantially complete’ by the middle of 2014, paving the way for its return to the private sector. Supporters of a break-up see it as a way of freeing the bank from long-standing bad debts, which could help it to lend more to businesses and boost the economy. The move is also said to be favoured by the commission as a way of increasing potential investor confidence in the ‘good’ part of the bank and increasing the chance of a successful reprivatisation. Backers: The idea of breaking up RBS is backed by former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson (left) and outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King . The so-called ‘bad’ bank would be held on to by the Government, avoiding the need for a fire sale of the more toxic assets and allowing them to recover in value. But the Treasury is reportedly considering the alternative of transferring the group’s troubled Ulster Bank operations to the Irish government in an effort to shore up RBS’s balance sheet. The commission’s recommendation could potentially be watered down by the time of its final report, but if not, the Chancellor would face a difficult dilemma. There has also been mounting speculation over the Government’s plans for Lloyds Banking Group after shares have recently risen above the 61.2p level at which the Government said it would break even on its 2008 bailout. A Treasury spokesman said: 'The Government’s policy remains that RBS continues to become a stronger and safer bank that supports the British economy, which in time can be returned to full private ownership when it’s in the interests of the taxpayer to do so. 'As the Chancellor has said, we need functioning banks supporting the real economy instead of nursing their wounds, and we will set out the way ahead once the Parliamentary Banking Commission has completed its work.'","Taxpayer owns 81% of troubled bank after 2008 bailout .

Tragic Meredith, 21, was brutally knifed to death just two months into her university programme in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia. Her sister Stephanie spoke out at the event, which was the first time she had been back in the city since Amanda Knox and Raffaelle Sollecito were cleared of the murder. Stephanie Kercher (left) pictured with Wladimiro Boccali and Olivia Taylor at the presentation of the Meredith Kercher scholarship in Perugia, Italy. Ms Kercher said she just wanted 'the truth' about her sister's death . Earlier this year Italy's Supreme Court threw out their acquittal and ordered a retrial which is due to begin in the autumn and Stephanie said: 'We are still waiting for answers. We just want the truth. 'It's difficult to speak of forgiveness when there are still so many unanswered questions. To be honest I'm not sure what we are expecting from the retrial - we all have mixed emotions. 'For the time being though I'm happy to be back in Perugia for a happy event. The last time I was here it was under very different circumstances. It's nice to be here for this scholarship in Meredith's memory. 'Meredith loved Perugia - I remember her telling us all about the chocolate festival when she first got here. She was so happy here - then a few weeks later we came over and their were pictures of Meredith and candles on the cathedral steps.' Meredith had arrived in Perugia in September 2007 to study Italian as part of her University of Leeds course and she had shared a house with Knox and two other women. She was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom. Knox and Sollecito were arrested and charged - at their first trial they were convicted and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. Then two years later in 2011 they were cleared and Knox, 25, immediately flew home to Seattle where she has recently published a book about her experiences and for which she was paid $4 million. Sollecito has moved from his home near Bari in southern Italy to Switzerland where he has set up an Internet firm after obtaining a degree in computer studies and both had always denied any involvement in the murder.

Perugia city council set up the scholarship thee years ago to honour Meredith and the first winner London student Olivia Taylor received the award at a ceremony at the town hall. Mayor Wladimiro Boccali said: 'We setup the scholarship because we felt that the true protagonist and the real victim of this tragic event had been forgotten. 'The city of Perugia will never forget Meredith, in fact we want to honour her as she will always be associated with Perugia and for this reason she should have a place in our memory. 'So to honour her that's why we have set up this scholarship aimed at students as Meredith was in Perugia studying and it is also our way of strengthening ties with Meredith's family. Stephanie Kercher is pictured with English student Olivia Taylor - the first recipient of the scholarship to remember Meredith Kercher . 'That event changed our lives and its a wound that we will always carry in our hearts but at the same time Meredith will always have a place in the hearts of Perugians. She was our guest and we feel a sense of impotency for not defending her.' Britain's ambassador in Rome, Christopher Prentice, said: 'The Kercher family, Meredith’s friends, and those whose lives Meredith touched have no need of an occasion in order to remember her. 'She will be with them always.  But the generous creation of a scholarship in her name by the authorities in Perugia will enable other young British women to study in and appreciate Perugia, a city Meredith loved, and to get to know the hospitality of Italy, a country which Meredith so enjoyed visiting.' Olivia, 19, from London, a first year Edinburgh University student studying Italian and Spanish, said: 'I was only 13 at the time of the murder but I remember it very well. Meredith was only a few years older than me when she died. The details were shocking. 'I was a bit apprehensive at first but I'm in a safe part of the city and it is so beautiful here. This is a fantastic opportunity and I'm looking forward to it. I met Stephanie and she was very supportive and very glad to be back for a more happier event.' The two month scholarship will cover fees and accommodation costs for Olivia and will be awarded yearly though applications to the Italian Embassy in London. Drifter Rudy Guede is currently serving a 16 year sentence for the murder and sexual assault of Meredith.","Meredith, 21, was knifed to death two months into exchange course .

In a challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority, 15 Labour MPs and the party’s biggest donor launched a campaign yesterday to force a policy change on the issue. It came as a poll found that Britons would vote narrowly – 51 per cent to 49 – to leave the EU if there were a referendum now. Businessman John Mills – who recently gave Labour shares worth £1.6million in his home shopping company JML – said it would be ‘unwise’ and ‘undemocratic’ for the party to refuse to give the public a say. Mr Mills even endorsed David Cameron’s plans to renegotiate Britain’s relations with Brussels and said that others in Labour are ‘tacitly’ backing a referendum, which Mr Miliband has repeatedly ruled out. One source in the campaign group Labour For A Referendum said: ‘At least ten members of the Shadow Cabinet [nearly half] are supportive.’ Last week, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘I don’t think we should set our face against a referendum and I certainly don’t think we can ever afford to give the impression that we know better than the voting public.’ Backing: James Wharton, the Tory MP who is piloting a backbench Bill through the Commons to enshrine the right to a referendum in law, claimed the Bill could become law with the support of Labour rebels . James Wharton, the Tory MP who is . piloting a backbench Bill through the Commons to enshrine the right to a . referendum in law, last night claimed the Bill – which has David . Cameron’s backing – could become law with the support of Labour rebels. A senior Tory told the Mail: ‘We can get this through if these people put their money where their mouths are. That’s all it takes.’ Wealthy pensioners could lose their free TV licences as well as their winter fuel allowance if Labour wins the next election. Ed Balls said on Monday that a future Labour government would strip cold weather payments from pensioners on the 40p tax rate. He originally ruled out raiding TV . licences – worth up to £145.50 a year –  but then said it might be . pragmatic to do so. But he later threw the policy into chaos, admitting . that it could cost more than it would save to scrap free TV licences. Senior Labour figures who have voiced support for a referendum include defence spokesman Jim Murphy, former Europe minister Keith Vaz and Jon Cruddas, who is running Mr Miliband’s policy review. Mr Cruddas said a failure to ‘trust people’ would lead public anger to ‘fester’. But Mr Miliband and foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander have ruled out a referendum. They do not want to risk being forced in government to leave the EU. Pressure for them to change their stance built yesterday when Labour MP Kate Hoey revealed that she was approached by a member of the Shadow Cabinet who told her that the party ‘will have to’ announce it is backing a referendum before next May’s European elections. Last night, Mr Mills warned that failing to back a referendum would cost votes in marginal seats.","15 Labour MPs and its biggest donor in campaign to force policy change .

The dancer who claims a former Coronation Street actor sexually abused him when he was a schoolboy broke down in tears in court today after he was accused of making up a 'malicious lie'. Andrew Lancel, 42, was charged last November under his real name Andrew Watkinson. The actor, from Gateacre in Liverpool, is best known for his role as Frank Foster in the ITV soap. Former Coronation Street actor Andrew Lancel arrives at Liverpool Crown Court with his wife Louise today . Lancel has pleaded not guilty to six counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of 16 and is on trial at Liverpool Crown Court. The charges relate to one male victim and the offending allegedly took place between 1993 and 1994 when he was aged 14 and 15. Today his accuser, now aged 34, was cross examined by Andrew Menary QC, defending. In a tense morning of questioning Mr Menary challenged various aspects of the accuser's account of what happened. Lancel (pictured with his wife) has pleaded not guilty to six counts of indecent assault of a child . The man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, claims he was aged just 14 and was 'star struck' by Lancel when the abuse began. He says the actor targeted him when he was performing in a production at a theatre group in Southport and would take him out for coffees before indecently assaulting him on numerous occasions over the next three years. But Mr Menary said the fact was that the defendant simply befriended him. He said: 'You understand that Andrew Lancel denies that there was ever any abuse. You understand that don't you?' The man, now a professional dancer, responded: 'I understand that he is denying it.' Mr Menary said: 'There was never any abuse at any time was there?' 'That's not true,' the man responded. Mr Menary went on to say there was 'never any intimacy or inappropriate contact' between them 'at any age'. The man replied: 'That's completely not true.' Mr Menary added: 'For whatever reason you have made up what is a malicious lie about him.' The man repeated: 'That's completely not true.' Soap star: Andrew Lancel, left, playing Frank Foster in Coronation Street with Sally Dynevor as Sally Webster . Actor: Liverpool-born star Andrew Lancel, is most famous for appearing in Coronation Street as Frank Foster. He is pictured here with Alison King as Carla Connor . The barrister then went on to point out inconsistencies in the accounts the man had given to the police and to his counsellors. The man said it had been hard for him to talk about it and that he had been 'embarrassed' to admit that he had continued to have sexual contact with the defendant into his early 20s when they were living in London. At certain points throughout the evidence Lancel, dressed in a black suit and striped tie and wearing thick rimmed black glasses, shook his head and folded his arms. Mr Menary went on to accuse the man of telling some people the abuse happened when he was 13, and not 14. Other role: Lancel plays Detective Inspector Neil Manson in The Bill . 'I might have said to somebody in the past it began when I was 13,' he said. He said it had taken him a long time to ""come to terms with"" and began to cry. Mr Menary asked if he need a break. The man, who told the court he was straight, replied: 'No, I want to answer this question.' He repeated he was 'embarrassed' by what he claims happened. Judge Clement Goldstone QC, the Recorder of Liverpool, then interjected and asked the man if it was true that he told people he was 13 and not 14 because he was embarrassed that he had not done anything about the alleged abuse and that he could 'justify' it more if he told people he was 13. The man nodded and then broke down, covering his face and looking away from the dock. The judge then adjourned the hearing for a short break. The prosecution claim the defendant, who is married with a son, used his 'status' as an actor to flatter and gain the trust of the boy, whom he knew he was under the age of consent. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Andrew Lancel charged last year under his real name Andrew Watkinson .

The notice stated: 'We promise that we will ensure accountability for anyone committing violations and they will be sent to the Sharia court of Iraq and al-Sham (Syria),' according to The Telegraph. Al Qaeda has said it is open to complaints from civilians in the rebel-held Syrian city of Raqqa (pictured).

He has been today jailed for life . A violent fantasist who stalked and terrorised a couple for 16 months has been jailed for life. Christopher Sims hid in bushes as he staked out the £1million home of Graeme and Clare Francis and in a series of incidents attacked them and killed their dog. Police believe he wanted to live out the plot of his novel which ended with the kidnap of a ‘well-to-do’ couple and the death of the wife. He researched the couple online and studied pictures of their six-bedroom home on Google, apparently selecting it because it lay on the edge of a village, surrounded by acres of farmland. Judge Keith Cutler, the Recorder of Winchester, said Mr and Mrs Francis lived in an ‘English countryside idyll’ and told Sims: ‘You turned their peaceful and contented lives into a nightmare of fear and terror.’ Jailing Sims for a minimum term of 16 years, the judge, sitting at Winchester Crown Court, said he had waged ‘a campaign of terror against victims chosen at random, without any cause or excuse.’ He added that the attacks bore a striking resemblance to passages from the ‘average-rate novel’ found on Sims’ memory stick. He said: ‘Your crimes are motiveless and bizarre. Your behaviour is described as dangerous and your writing showed an ability to conceive extreme and gruesome violence.’ Sims was dubbed the ‘silent stalker’ by villagers in Longparish, near Andover, Hampshire, after he was seen prowling near the couple’s mansion, wearing a balaclava and latex gloves. The couple were terrified by the sightings and were later attacked in incidents Mrs Francis likened to a horror film. Mr Francis, 61, and his wife, 58, a cookery teacher, called their ordeal a ‘living hell’ and an ‘absolute terror’ which left them afraid to walk alone. The court heard Sims, 40, lost his . job as a BT engineer and invested everything in setting up a solar panel . business which failed, costing him the home he shared with his nurse . wife in Andover. Christopher Sims stalked wealthy Clare (left) and Graeme Francis (right) using Google Earth and shot dead their dog, . in a 16 month reign of terror. He has today been jailed for life . He moved back to his parents’ home . but then lived rough, sleeping in a tent where he appeared to have been . writing the novel while planning his attacks. Sims wrote that he wanted to become a . ‘serial kidnapper’ and planned to attack the owners of ‘quiet country . houses’ because they were the ‘easiest targets’. The attacks on the couple began in . December 2010 when he kicked Mrs Francis to the ground in her garden and . tried to hit her with a cosh, but ran off after she began to scream for . her husband. In July 2011, he killed their . five-year-old golden retriever, Saffron, with an air rifle, and . confronted Mrs Francis later that month while wearing a balaclava and . blue latex gloves. In the next attack, Sims confronted Mr Francis as he . left his office in the grounds of the house to walk back to the main . house. He hit Mr Francis with an 18-inch . metal pole, causing a wound which exposed his skull. Mr Francis was left . with a three-inch scar and suffered hearing loss. Winchester Crown Court heard that he shot dead their golden retriever and attacked them several times on their own property in Longparish, Hampshire (pictured), 'without any apparent anger' In his novel, Sims wrote: ‘He walked . down the steps from his office. As he reaches the driveway, this is . where I will hit him over the head with the cosh and render him . unconscious. I will drag him behind the building out of sight.’ The couple, who have four children, . were left needing anti-depressants and sleeping tablets to cope with the . ordeal. Police were so concerned by the violence of the attacks that . they installed panic alarms and offered to put the couple in a safe . house. Sims was stopped by police once in . Longparish but released after giving his details. He had no previous . convictions or history of mental illness. He was caught only after he attacked . two other men, clubbing 74-year-old John Casey three times with a lump . hammer after he gave Sims a lift in his car. Sims stopped only when the . hammer broke. Judge Cutler said: ‘With enormous . presence of mind and great bravery Mr Casey put his fingers in your . mouth so if police found his body there would be a record of your DNA.’ Sims later attacked kebab van owner Ercan Yucekaya, 22, in a layby near Hook on two occasions late at night. After his arrest in March 2012, police discovered the novel in his tent and realised that he was Mr and Mrs Francis’s stalker. The couple aged in their 60s were attacked in their 'rural idyll' of Longparish (pictured). They called the ordeal a 'living hell' and an 'absolute terror' that has left them afraid to walk alone and on anti-depressants and sleeping tablets . Sims pleaded guilty to seven charges . including the harassment of Mr and Mrs Francis and grievous bodily harm . attacks on Mr Francis, Mr Casey and Mr Yucekaya. Judge Cutler said the reasons for the . attacks remained a ‘complete mystery’ because Sims – who claims not to . remember the assaults – had refused to see a court-appointed . psychiatrist. After his arrest, he was treated at . Broadmoor for a suspected personality disorder but doctors cannot agree . whether his claimed amnesia is genuine or fake. Judge Cutler rejected calls by Sims’ lawyers to give him a hospital order but urged him to co-operate with doctors in prison. Although the minimum term means Sims . could be considered for parole in eight years, Judge Cutler said he . would be kept in prison for the rest of his life if doctors believed he . continued to pose a risk to the public. Speaking after the case, Mr Francis, a . mergers and acquisitions lawyer who has worked with Heston Blumenthal . as company secretary of the chef’s famous Fat Duck restaurant, said he . believed the sentence was appropriate. He said: ‘We are very pleased that . this is all over and behind us. I would like to thank our friends and . family for their support and the police for their efforts.’","Christopher Sims, 40, attacked four people with coshes and hammer .

A lawyer for the Leveson Inquiry who had an affair with a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press was paid more than £200,000 by taxpayers. Carine Patry Hoskins charged fees of £218,606 between July 2011 and November 2012 for her work on the counsel team used by Lord Justice Leveson for his investigation into  media standards. Rob Wilson, the Conservative  MP who uncovered the figures through parliamentary questions, said it was ‘one hell of a pay day’ given the judge’s claim that Miss Patry Hoskins had no influence over his findings. Pay: Leveson barrister Carine Patry Hoskins received almost £220,000 in fees, it emerged . Mr Wilson has led calls for an inquiry . into whether the relationship between the married mother-of-two and . David Sherborne, a barrister representing advocates of statutory Press . regulation, could have compromised its findings. A code of conduct suggests that . affairs between opposing lawyers risk creating the perception of ‘a . danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Mr Sherborne, who represented Hugh . Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to . the Greek island of Santorini with Miss Patry Hoskins in August last . year – while the inquiry was being conducted. The pair claim they simply discussed . the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’. They . say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry . had ended in December. Affair: She reportedly began a relationship with David Sherborne, a lawyer who acted for several celebrities during the inquiry including actor Hugh Grant . Lord Justice Leveson has rejected any . suggestion that his report into press standards may have been tainted by . the relationship and insisted ‘every finding of fact, every conclusion . and every recommendation’ in last year’s report was his alone. Mr Wilson, parliamentary aide to . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, says he will write again to Lord Justice . Leveson to request a full breakdown of the work done by Miss Patry . Hoskins. ‘This is one hell of a pay day for . someone described by Lord Justice Leveson as doing merely mechanical and . fact-checking work,’ the MP said. ‘It raises questions as to whether . this is value for taxpayers’ money as to why she was paid over ten times . the average wage only to have no influence or input whatsoever into the . Leveson Report. ‘Surely someone more junior could have . undertaken these junior tasks – at a fraction of the cost? This is . either an extravagant use of taxpayers’ money, or we do not yet know the . full extent of her work. ‘I will be writing to Lord Justice . Leveson to request a full breakdown of what Carine Patry Hoskins was . paid for in the light of the huge sums of taxpayers’ money involved.’ Appointment: Barrister Robert Jay QC, who became the face of the Leveson Inquiry griling witnesses for months, was today made a High court Judge where he was pictured with wife Deborah . Miss Patry Hoskins became known as . ‘woman on the left’ and received thousands of mentions on Twitter for . her close attention to Grant’s evidence during the 97-day inquiry, which . cost £5.44million. Counsel’s fees hit £1.44million, with a further . £315,600 spent on barristers providing assistance to counsel. Lord Justice Leveson has said it was . for the Bar Standards Board, not him, to determine whether there has . been any breach of the professional code of conduct. He also said he . would not be ‘engaging in further public debate about the work of the . inquiry or the integrity of its processes’. In his report, he thanked the inquiry . counsel, who included Miss Patry Hoskins, for ‘collating and presenting . such a massive volume of evidence so efficiently’. He said that as second junior counsel . to his inquiry, Miss Patry Hoskins ‘undertook all of her work at the . request and under the direction of either myself or Robert Jay QC’.","Carine Patry Hoskins dubbed the 'woman on the left' during inquiry .

The footage shows you lost it. 'It may well have been somebody who you did not think deserved to take the money but you are a manager of a medium sized hotel and it was humiliating for him. The former employee was hit under the reception desk before being dragged across the hotel lobby . 'This is not the way for an employer to behave. 'The attack was in the reception area of the hotel in public view where customers could have been walking in the hotel. 'They could have seen the shocking sight of a boss kicking and punching one of his employees while the receptionist was trying to intervene.' Robert Hardman was likened to TV character Basil Fawlty who often flew into a rage with waiter Manuel . The court heard how father-of-two Hardman flipped when the victim walked into his £75-a-night hotel at 4.30pm on October 22 last year and demanded his back pay. In the classic TV show Fawlty Towers starring John Cleese, Basil often hit Manuel the waiter played by Andrew Sachs . Alex Bull, prosecuting, said the two men then got into an argument before Hardman punched the victim three times in the face so he fell to the floor. Ms Bull said: 'He then punched him under the desk and dragged him out of the building.' The court heard the victim suffered injuries to his lip, eye, nose and his two front teeth were fractured. Hardman was arrested and initially denied the attack during his first police interview but later pleaded guilty to a charge of causing actual bodily harm. He was also ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work, pay £1,750 to compensation to the victim, £250 costs and a £100 fine. Harry Day, defending, said: 'The attack was totally out of character. 'Mr Harding earns about £1,900 a month and works seven days a week.' The court heard the victim may have to have root canal treatment as a result of the injuries. Staff at the hotel, which on its website describes itself as being 'proud of our reputation of friendly accommodating staff' described Hardman as 'a real-life Basil Fawlty,' the character played by John Cleese in Fawlty Towers. In the popular TV sitcom, Basil often flew into a rage at Spanish waiter Manuel. One worker said today: 'Mr Hardman lives up to his name as hard. No one will mess about with him. Scene: Robert Hardman runs the three-star Plough Hotel in Northampton . Landmark: During the Second World War, the hotel was used by the American Red Cross . 'He is a likeable man and can be very funny but when he feels like he has been taken advantage of he can lose it. 'We joke that he is the real life Basil Fawlty because he can get angry with people especially guests and people on the phone but I've never known him to be violent. 'I think on this occasion he just saw the red mist and went mad.' The hotel is a landmark of Northampton and was built in 1879. During the Second World War, it was used by the American Red Cross Society as a leave centre for American troops. Over three years, a total of 174,000 servicemen stayed at the hotel and the American flag was raised above the building every day.","Robert Hardman, 54, runs the three-star Plough Hotel in Northampton .

Dogan Ismail, 17, was lured to his death with a promise that a BlackBerry handset would be returned . A 15-year-old boy who stabbed a 'model pupil' to death as he pleaded for the return of a stolen mobile phone is today facing a life sentence. Dogan Ismail, 17, was lured to his death with a promise that the BlackBerry handset  - stolen from a friend - would be returned. But instead, his attacker - who has previous convictions for carrying a knife - emerged with a knife. He plunged it into the chest of sixth form student Dogan, who collapsed and bled to death at the scene on the Aylesbury Estate in Walworth, southeast London, last December 30. The 15-year-old, who cannot be named, denied murder but was convicted after a week-long trial at the Old Bailey. Judge Christopher Moss QC told him: ‘The sentence the court is bound to impose for a boy of your age for murder is one of detention at Her Majesty’s Pleasure. ‘I have to set the minimum term you must serve before you can be considered for release.’ The youth, originally from Gambia, will be sentenced on July 2, when Judge Moss consider lifting the court order that protects the killer’s identity. Dogan’s mother wept and left court as the verdicts were delivered, while his killer scowled in the dock. Jurors heard the teenage knifeman had been part of a group who snatched the phone from an associate of Dogan's two days earlier. Dogan found out about the theft after asking why the other boy had been unable to contact him. He then vowed he would track down the culprit and get the phone returned and the pair took a 343 bus from Peckham to the Aylesbury Estate. The 15-year-old, who cannot be named, denied murder but was convicted after a week-long trial at the Old Bailey . The 15-year-old initially agreed to return the phone before leading them to a flat he claimed was his and telling them he would fetch it from inside. But when he returned, he was wielding a knife, the court heard. In a video interview played to jurors, the victim’s associate, who is now aged 16 and also cannot be named, said: ‘He genuinely thought he was going to get the phone back and it would be alright. ‘But [the alleged killer] comes out with a knife and walks straight up to him and stabs him in the chest.‘He said, “You’ve stabbed me” and falls on the floor. ‘[The alleged killer] just walks away casually.’ The 15-year-old, from Peckham, admitted theft of the mobile phone but denied murder.

The pensioner was held in east London yesterday afternoon and taken into police custody before being released on bail until July. Yewtree is exploring three strands: claims against Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving people not linked to the DJ. This east London man falls under the strand of Yewtree police have termed others, and he is the 13th person to be arrested as part of the investigation.

It came as a different pensioner, who was earlier arrested in south London as part of the Jimmy Savile sex probe, has been released without charge. The 65-year-old was held in February on suspicion of sexual offences and taken into police custody. But a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said today there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. The freed man was also arrested in the 'others' strand. Most of the allegations relating to 'others' have been made against people associated with the entertainment industry, including ex-glam rocker Gary Glitter and comedian Freddie Starr. PR guru Max Clifford, TV star and comedian Jim Davidson and entertainer Rolf Harris are also among those who have been arrested.

Of those making complaints about the late DJ, 73 per cent were children at the time of the offences.

"By . Monty Don . PUBLISHED: . 19:42 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:03 EST, 3 June 2013 . On a fine summer’s morning I love to go out into my garden early, before most of the world is awake, and gather one of my favourite harvests. This is a small basket of roses, still glittering with dew. These are then spilt onto the kitchen table and arranged in up to half a dozen vases, which I place around the house, with their fragrance gently rising from them like wisps of unseen smoke. There is none of the florist’s skill in this. No need. There is nothing I could do to make the roses more lovely than they already are. In the border or in a vase, these are floral royalty. Alluring: Monty Don says the attraction of the rose is irrational, because it taps into a deep vein of romance that lies within the most hardened heart . Expert: The seasoned gardener has seen some of the world's most exotic plants and flowers, but still rates the traditional rose above them all . They are intoxicating and irresistible and roses play on our deep, instinctive responses more than any other plant, which is perhaps why they have just been voted the nation’s favourite flower. We can rationalise this attraction as much as we like, but in the end roses tap into a deep vein of romance that lies within the most hardened heart. The rose — the word comes from the Greek Rodon (red) and early cultivated roses were largely crimson in colour — has inspired arts and artisans throughout the centuries and its flowers appear in paintings as far back as 2000 BC. The oldest fossil record of a plant clearly identifiable as a member of what botanists call the genus Rosa comes from the Colorado rock formation more than 30 million years ago, and petrified rose wreaths have been unearthed from Ancient Egyptian tombs. Under Islam, in enclosed gardens from the Alhambra in Spain to Kashmir, the rose was celebrated as a symbol of perfection. Its subtle yet direct magic has always cast a spell. Above all, roses are the most direct floral expression of love. On Valentine’s Day — when we are still in the grip of winter and not a single rose is blooming in the UK — a huge number are sold: this year nearly three million ‘flower gifts’ consisting of up to a dozen roses. In the U.S., more than 198 million red roses were bought. One irony is that most of these roses will be soulless and scentless, grown in polytunnels, designed to be identical and without character. A garden rose filled with fragrance, on the other hand, is truly intoxicating and I suspect the power of scent plays a much greater part in this unavoidable attraction than we realise. The reason most of us love roses is the combination of the delicacy of the scent and the incredible voluptuousness of the flowers, ranging from an almost wistful delicacy in a rose such as Alba Semiplena to the impossibly full convolutions of a centifolia such as Juno or Fantin Latour. Rose scent rarely wafts on the air; you have to nuzzle up to them and intimately smell their fragrance as you might savour the bouquet of a fine wine. I grow centifolias, damasks, albas, gallicas, bourbons, hybrid perpetuals, moss roses and rugosas. All have superb scents, but my favourites are the albas, which somehow manage to be both delicate and lingering in the nose. Appeal: The reason most of us love roses is the combination of the delicacy of the scent and the incredible voluptuousness of the flowers . This scent of fresh roses has an active ingredient called phenylethylamine (also contained, intriguingly, in chocolate) which contains an amino acid known to slow the breakdown of the endorphin hormone. So a bunch of roses and a box of chocolates is more than just a romantic gesture. They actually induce a chemical enhancement of wellbeing and romance. Certainly, a garden with several shrub and climbing roses, burdened with flowers in midsummer, is as near to a romantic heaven as we are likely to find on this earth. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite was not only the goddess of love but also the goddess of gardens and fruitfulness, and the rose was sacred to her. The blood-pure flower, so universally accepted as a definition of loveliness, was adopted by early Christians as the symbol of the Virgin Mary, the five petals representing the five senses, and the thorns the tribulations of life that have to be braved to reach the flower. I grow a lot of roses in my garden and have ramblers scrambling up apple trees, climbers on my walls and scores of shrub varieties in  my borders. Although I love the richness of red roses such as Tuscany or the rich burgundy of Souvenir du Dr Jamain — one of the few roses that is better grown in shade — no colour becomes a rose better than pink. My favourite of all is a full, many-petalled flower that is a delicate, almost shy pink called Cuisse de Nymphe, which literally means ‘thigh of a nymph’ — the mythological beautiful girls that were spirits of Nature — but which was translated by the rather shocked Victorians as ‘Great Maiden’s Blush’. By any name, it is a seductive rose. Aphrodite: In Greek mythology she was not . only the goddess of love but also the goddess of gardens and . fruitfulness . We think of roses being a very English flower but, although we have 14 native wild roses, the multi-petalled roses that we all recognise and love originate from the Middle East and were bought to this country by Crusaders when they returned home. Of course, in the Wars Of The Roses the emblems of the two warring houses, York and Lancaster, were the white Rosa Alba for York and the red Gallica Officionalis for the Red Rose of Lancaster. Neither is native to this country but the victorious Henry VII combined the two as an emblem in the symbolic and very English Tudor Rose. The great age of rose-breeding was the Victorian era and France was its European centre, not least because it had a climate in the south of the country that many roses prefer to the rather soggy, grey North of Europe. Last summer, I visited Malmaison, the garden of Napoleon’s wife Josephine, who set out to collect every rose in the world. At that time, this was thought to be some 250 types. Classic: Roses have become the traditional Valentine's Day gift, and a symbol for love the world over . By 1910, the first garden dedicated just to roses, Roseraie de l’Hay, in the southern suburbs of Paris, had 8,000 different roses, which was then every variety and species known. For flowers with such sensuous, delicate petals, roses are surprisingly tough plants. There is much fetishisation of their pruning, but research has shown that a chainsaw or hedge-trimmer does as good a job as the most artful work with secateurs — and that, left to their own devices, most roses live long and flower prodigiously. My advice to any new gardener wanting to include roses in a garden but uncertain how best to treat them is to plant them deep, mulch them thickly every spring, dead-head regularly but otherwise let them get on with it. They are the least troublesome of plants. But it is not their toughness that we celebrate, nor their ease for the gardener, however we prune them. Their real magic is found as a bowl of roses picked that morning from the garden, touched with dew, glowing with silky colour and filling the room with subtle but sublime fragrance. To enjoy roses at their most perfect, here are some of the finest gardens to visit this month . . . Sissinghurst Castle, Cranbrook, Kent . Vita Sackville-West’s garden has a superb collection of ‘Old’ or shrub roses, many planted more than 60 years ago, forming one of the country’s most romantic rose gardens.

'Indefensible': Speaker John Bercow and his wife Sally, who have three young children, have previously said their nanny was 'live-in' The Commons Speaker is facing a storm of criticism after it emerged his children's nanny lives in a taxpayer-funded apartment in the Houses of Parliament. John Bercow - who earns over £140,000 per year and has backed calls for pay rises for MPs - and his wife Sally have given their nanny the run of the housekeeper’s apartment near their own palatial rooms inside the Palace of Westminster. The nanny’s accommodation in the Commons is entirely covered by the public purse, including the council tax and utility bills. The arrangement has been described as 'indefensible' by a former chairman of the Standards in Public Life committee. The Bercows, who have three young children, have separately acquired a riverside property nearby for £935,000 just four miles away. Previously the couple said that their nanny was ‘live-in’. But . according to details released after a freedom of information request, . it now transpires that she lives in a separate flat consisting of one . bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and a living room. Renting such a property in the prime . SW1 postcode near Westminster could cost at least £2,000 a month, or . closer to £4,000 for the most well-appointed property. Taxpayers are picking up the bill for the Band G property, which Westminster City Council charges £1,141 a year for. Late . last year, the couple bought another Thames-side apartment in an . exclusive, gated development in Battersea, four miles south-west of the . Palace of Westminster. The apartment is 3,100 square foot with plenty of room for a growing family and domestic staff. A . spokesman for the House of Commons said: ‘The House of Commons has for . many years provided accommodation for previous Speakers’ personal staff. 'The current Speaker . has a young family and therefore requires full-time childcare support . (paid for by him), so the former Housekeeper’s accommodation is provided . for a nanny. The flat consists of one bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom and a living room. There is no separate utility supply to the flat. He . added: ‘Accommodation on the House of Commons estate is provided as . officeholders, and therefore those who support them, are required to be . available on the parliamentary estate over prolonged periods and at . unpredictable times.’ Asked whether the Bercows pay tax on the perks, the spokesman replied that the House of Commons did not have the information. The . Speaker’s wife, Sally, first revealed the family’s childcare . arrangements on Twitter two years ago, saying: ‘Does John Bercow’s nanny . live rent-free at his grace-and-favour house? Yes. It’s no secret. Or . scandal.’ She later said: ‘We have a ‘live-in’ nanny. Who lives in. So . doesn’t pay rent. WE PAY HER SALARY.’ Prime postcode: A comparable property with an SW1 postcode could cost up to £4,000 per month in rent . The nanny lived in the flat with her husband. It is not clear if the Bercows still employ the same nanny. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Anyone in the outside world taking on a live-in nanny has to cover the cost of their accommodation and bills, so why should the Speaker be any different? He is extremely well paid and already enjoys a number of taxpayer-funded perks. ‘The full details of all perks and benefits-in-kind enjoyed by him, his family and staff should be a matter of public record, so that they can be properly scrutinised.’ Mr Bercow’s salary as Speaker is £141,504 a year. Nannies who live in are usually paid less than those who have to live outside the home and fund their own rent, meaning that taxpayers could be subsidising the wages for the Bercows’ domestic staff. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on Standards in Public Life, which scrutinises politicians’ behaviour, said the arrangement was ‘indefensible’. He told the Mail: ‘I am surprised that in this current climate he cannot cover the costs from his generous salary. 'It is indefensible really that thousands if not millions of people who have childcare costs themselves have to fund the privilege of a flat and all the expenses with that.’","John and Sally Bercow have previously said their nanny was 'live-in'

A plan to open a Kung Fu centre in a derelict hotel using £1.6million of public funds has been scrapped. The proposed martial arts retreat in Llangollen, North Wales, was today described in a report into the failed project as a waste of money. The Welsh Government bought the River Lodge Hotel in 2007 with the intention of leasing it back to community group Powys Fadog. But delays led the building to become an unusable ruin, forcing the decision to abandon the centre. Today a government committee described the purchase as a 'troubling' waste of public funds. It had been the brainchild of martial arts expert Pol Wong who wanted to create the first Shaolin centre outside China. Failure: The Welsh Government spent £1.6million on the River Lodge Hotel to turn it into a martial arts centre but it has never opened . He said: 'It's just a wreck and that for me is heartbreaking. That was . a dream that we'd achieved. Dreams: Pol Wong, head of the Powys Fadog community group, had hoped to set up the first Shaolin temple outside of China . 'We got permission from the Shaolin temple . in China - these things don't come easy. 'To stop it like that is heartbreaking. It's been almost like a bereavement.' Mr Wong, a monk, . claims constant delays and obstacles created by the Assembly led to the . building deteriorating to the point where it was unusable. He claims to have invested £90,000 in the centre which he said would have generated 30 jobs. He added: 'I am stunned and so depressed after we have worked so hard and spent so much money on the project. 'It's five years that have been wasted when we could have been employing people and bringing health and fitness to people.' A report released last year said the . purchase was 'flawed' and said evidence suggested the Welsh Government . probably paid more than the property was worth. It has since incurred costs of around £200,000 for maintenance and repairs of the building. The Welsh Audit Office found that by June 2011, Powys Fadog had failed to provide evidence that it . had secured enough funding to undertake the necessary repairs and improvements to the building,  or to pay the rents . due under the lease. The report also highlighted a 'significant' conflict of interest with a Welsh Government official involved with the project. Devastated: Former Kung Fu world champion Pol Wong described the decision to abandon the martial arts centre as 'heartbreaking' The Welsh Government's Public Accounts Committee made has now made 21 recommendations for improvements following the blunder. Committee chair Darren Millar said: 'This inquiry has been one of the most illuminating and troubling ever undertaken by the committee. 'The fact that over £1m of public money has been wasted as a result of the various decisions taken in the course of this troubled project is concerning enough in itself. 'But it is the flaws in civil service systems and processes which this inquiry has exposed. It left us deeply uneasy.' The Welsh Government said they would carefully consider the report. A spokesman said: 'We recognise that there were shortcomings in the way in which the acquisition and disposal were dealt with. 'We will carefully consider the public accounts committee's report and respond formally to them.'

"By . Paul Revoir . PUBLISHED: . 18:20 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:28 EST, 30 April 2013 . In his role as the BBC’s business editor, he does not usually have his emotions  on show. But Robert Peston has laid bare in heart-wrenching detail his grief at the death of his wife last year, revealing how he transcribed the handwritten manuscript of her last novel so that he could ‘keep talking to her’. In an article for Radio Times Mr Peston has written candidly of the love he felt for his wife and how his family tried to deal with the effects of her battle with lung cancer. Describing author Siân Busby, with whom he first became friends as a teenager, as ‘the woman I loved for most of my conscious life’, he praised the bravery and stoicism she showed in dealing with the illness. Tragic death: Peston's wife Siân Busby died from lung cancer in August last year aged just 51 . Mr Peston, 53, said that through the ‘sheer force of her will’ his wife had remained ‘poised and beautiful’ despite the ‘relentless’ treatment and ‘terrible shocks and emergencies’ that came with the disease. He said his wife had worked on the book, A Commonplace Killing, until her illness had become ‘excruciating and wholly incapacitating’. He revealed that he did not know the work had been completed until he started reading her ‘handwriting as familiar as my own’ on the page and ‘hearing her voice in my head’. He described it as an ‘exquisite work’ which was ‘more-or-less perfect’. Set in 1946, the book has been described as a gripping murder story which highlights a ‘post-war world of disillusionment, bitterness and emotional disturbance’. Mr Peston began to transcribe it a few days after his wife died last September at the age of 51. It will be published on Thursday. He said: ‘My motive was selfish: I wanted to keep talking to her. I still do. The tears could not be staunched as I read, deciphered and typed.’ He added: ‘Here she was, all hope lost of reprieve from the lethal cancer, reflecting on what it is like to know that death awaits on the morrow.’ When he read the manuscript, he marvelled ‘at her victory over devastating circumstance’. Devastated: The BBC's political editor transcribed his late wife's manuscript because he wanted 'to keep talking to her' Mr Peston said that while the book was a ‘jewel’ in its own right, the fact that Miss Busby wrote it after receiving her ‘death sentence’ made it even more precious to him. He recalled movingly how, last August, a consultant oncologist revealed that nothing more could be done to help his wife other than ‘take the edge off’ her suffering. He said: ‘It was almost exactly five years to the day after Siân – who is probably the only person I know who has never smoked a cigarette – was diagnosed with lung cancer. In the ensuing years, she never despaired or resorted to self-pity, even as the cancer spread. ‘The cycle of surgery, body-racking chemicals and radiation was relentless. Life became punctuated by terrible shocks and emergencies. Yet those who met her at pretty much any point in this ordeal encountered the Siân they had always known: solicitous, supportive, witty, insightful, unselfish.’ Mr Peston said the priority was that their two boys – Max, the son he had with Miss Busby, and Simon, her son from her first marriage – were not continually being asked about their mother’s health, and that his wife ‘just got on with living’. In fact, Mr Peston said, there were ‘wonderful years’ earlier in her illness when the disease did not ‘haunt’ them but made them focus on the important things, such as family, work, ‘friends, beauty and fun’. Peston, left, has given a frank interview about losing his wife in this week's Radio Times . But he admitted that once his wife had got to the point of finishing her final novel, the cancer was more like ‘a monster laying waste to our family’. He said: ‘Siân was being turned into an invalid, in almost unimaginable pain most of the time. For her, what was perhaps worse was that she was being robbed of her ability to take care of those she loved.’ But he said there had been ‘an almost moral imperative not to be ground down by circumstances, even if those circumstances are an express train thundering in our direction’. In the article he talked about letters he had kept which she had sent him when they were studying at university more than 30 years ago, and when they were ‘too-briefly a couple’ before they were apart for 12 years. They rekindled their relationship after her first marriage ended. The Radio Times piece includes a letter from his ‘beautiful’ wife – who was a schoolfriend of Mr Peston’s sister – written when she was 18. Mr Peston said: ‘She was the most brilliant, caring, humane and loving person I have met. And funny. I miss her all the time.’","Business editor transcribed handwritten manuscript of wife's final novel .

Oswald hurriedly entered, grabbed a jacket and headed back out into the neighborhood. Soon after, Oswald fatally shot Officer J.D. Tippit, then was arrested at the Texas Theatre. Hall said her grandmother, an admirer of President Kennedy, was saddenned by her connection to Oswald. 'My grandmother was very embarrassed . and humiliated that her home would be associated with someone that would . do something like that. She began getting death threats. She received a . lot of hate mail,' Ms Hall said. But . Ms Johnson also refused to vilify Oswald, known to her as O.H.

The city of Dallas will hold a commemoration November 22 in . Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy's motorcade was passing as shots rang out. 'I decided if there was going to be a right time, this was the right time,' she said. David Preziosi, executive director of Preservation Dallas, said the home is 'part of the whole story of what happened that day. We think it's pretty significant in terms of telling the story of the assassination,' Preziosi said. The house in the Oak Cliff neighborhood just southwest of downtown Dallas has four bedrooms and one bathroom on its main floor and five bedrooms and one bathroom in a basement. There's also a two-story garage apartment with eight bedrooms and two bathrooms. The list price of the house, built in 1935, will be disclosed when it goes on the market Saturday. Ms Hall, a seventh-grader when President Kennedy was assassinated, can remember Oswald breaking up a fight between her brothers in the front yard of the house. 'He separated them and sat them down on the porch and sat between them and said, `I want to tell you something and I want you to listen to me. 'You are brothers and you have to look out for each other, you have to love and never do anything that would harm another human being,' Ms Hall said.","Oswald believed to have been sniper who killed president in 1963 .

That's because Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 56, has lost an eye-watering $52million of his personal wealth this month, leaving him with shares worth 'just' $232million. Five top bank chiefs have seen their combined shareholding value fall by almost $100million on paper in the last two weeks, reported Bloomberg. Tricky month: Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein, 56, has already lost an eye-watering $52million of his personal wealth in August . Heads of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley saw the plunge occur from July 29 to August 10. That includes a $40million drop just on Wednesday. Mr Blankfein’s $52million is greater than the combined losses of all four other men. ‘My entire net worth is in this company,’ Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, 51, told Bloomberg earlier this week. ‘We believe in the stock.’ The value of his 486,000 shares dropped from $4.7million on July 29 to $3.3million on Wednesday as the company’s stock price fell to $6.77. Financial troubles: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, left, and James Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, right, have both suffered big paper losses this month . Drops: Vikram Pandit of Citigroup, left, and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, right, have watched the value of their shares fall as stock markets plummeted .

Investors are mainly concerned the U.S. economy is getting weaker and that the European debt crisis could spread across the Atlantic. Poor consumer confidence data today did little to help sentiment, but better retail sales and jobless figures were released this week. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, bought 100,000 shares last Thursday at $20.62 each before his stock dropped to $16.45 on Wednesday. He has seen total stock losses of $5.4million - but this is nothing compared to Mr Blankfein’s huge losses, reported Bloomberg. Mr Blankfein’s holdings were worth $232million at Wednesday’s closing price, down 18 per cent on July 29 from $284million. James Dimon, 55, of JPMorgan, was the second biggest loser, with his stock dropping 15 per cent from $205million to $175million. ‘We . will build this business,’ he told CNBC earlier this week. ‘And I . guarantee you in five years the stock will be higher than today.’ Vikram Pandit, 54, of Citigroup, saw his stock value fall 26 per cent to $13million from $18million at the end of last month.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the teenager said that 'the next thing she knew’, she was waking up in an ambulance taking her to hospital. She was attacked outside the Black Lion pub in Plaistow. CCTV footage was circulated by police in an effort to find the man responsible, with the girl's face blurred to protect her identity. The teenager was taken to Newham General Hospital with bruising and cuts to her head and face, but was released the same day after tests.

It may look eminently respectable with its neat, double-fronted facade – but this house hides scandalous Royal secrets. In the 1930s, the property – now on the market for £18 million – was the love nest of the Prince of Wales, who later became Edward VIII and famously stunned the nation by abdicating to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. In 1930 the mansion, just north of Regent’s Park, was the London home of Viscountess Furness, who was then Edward’s mistress. And it may also be the place where Edward romanced Mrs Simpson, since it is claimed that she also stayed there and was visited by the Prince. Secret meetings: The house in Primrose Hill, West London, where it is alleged Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson played out their affair . Historian Anne Sebba, who wrote the Duchess of Windsor’s biography, That Woman: The Life Of Wallis Simpson, said of the Prince of Wales: ‘He liked to visit his mistresses in their own home.' Lady Furness lived in the mansion with her husband, Marmaduke, the first Viscount Furness. He was chairman of Furness Withy shipbuilders and one of the richest men in Britain at the time. His wife, Thelma, was an American socialite. Wallis Simpson’s husband Ernest was a shipping executive, and both he and Wallis were American by birth. The two couples were introduced to each other through a mutual friend at the US Embassy in London. Royal affair: The Duke and Duchess of Windsor after their marriage . The Prince was part of the Furnesses’ set. Apart from their London home in Elsworthy Road, which was then . known as Kirbygate, the Furnesses had a prestigious country house, . Burrough Court, near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire – prime foxhunting . territory. The Prince, a passionate devotee of field sports, was a . regular guest. Seok Swycher, who owns the Elsworthy Road house with her husband Stuart, an international property developer, is curious to find out for certain the role played by the property in the Royal affair that provoked a constitutional crisis. Seok, who is downsizing, said: ‘When we bought the house more than 30 years ago, it was dilapidated and was three separate flats. We restored it into a proper family home. But I remember, when the building work was going on, that a couple walked by and told me Wallis and Ernest Simpson once lived here. ‘We knew the Furnesses lived here, and so we can only assume that at some point the Furnesses let the Simpsons use one of the apartments. ‘Maybe the Simpsons were looking for a base in London, or perhaps they were between addresses, but the lady had a definite memory that they actually lived here at 48 Elsworthy Road. She even remembered seeing the Prince turning up at the house in his Bentley.’ Thelma – pronounced the Spanish way: Telma – married the Viscount in 1926. It was a second marriage for each of them. Thelma and the Prince of Wales grew close in 1930 when they went on safari in east Africa. The Prince first met the Simpsons in January 1931, at Burrough Court. The couple had been invited to join a weekend house party to act as chaperone to Thelma, whose husband was away. Shedding light: The living room of the property where the then Prince of Wales may have had not one but two mistresses in Wallis Simpson and the Viscountess Furness . London mansion: The kitchen in the £18million property which originally consisted of three apartments but has been converted into a family home . Thelma then became the Prince’s . regular companion at his home, Fort Belvedere in Sunningdale, Berkshire, . where the Simpsons were also regular weekend guests. The affair continued until 1934, . when Thelma decided to spend three months in New York. Before sailing, . she took Wallis to The Ritz for lunch and asked her to ‘look after’ the . Prince while she was away. The Simpsons were then living in Bryanston Court, near Marble Arch, where they held daily cocktail parties. The Prince became a regular guest, often staying for dinner and even later. By the time Thelma returned from New York, she had been ousted by Wallis in the Prince’s affections. The Viscount and Thelma divorced in 1933 but records show that in 1934 he was still paying the rates on the Elsworthy Road house and a rate book for the address reveals that Viscountess Thelma Furness was the occupier. Local council records also include reference to the house in a book entitled Streets Of Belsize, which states: ‘No 48 has a history; in the early 1930s, it belonged to Viscount Furness, whose wife Thelma had, says the DNB [Dictionary Of National Biography], a “passing affair with the Prince of Wales; he was reputedly a frequent visitor to this house”.’ The Arts and Crafts-style 1903 home has seven bedrooms over three storeys. www.behrandbutchoff.com, 020 7722 7222 .","London mansion where Edward VIII seduced Wallis Simpson on sale .

A confused pensioner who drove the wrong way on a motorway told police that it was his first mistake in 50 years. Colin Walker, 77, who is now undergoing tests for Alzheimer's Disease, said: 'It's my first mistake in 50 years on the roads.' The pensioner wreaked havoc on the M56 near Manchester Airport as cars swerved to avoid crashing into his Nissan Micra. A court heard he was lucky to be alive as he was sentenced for dangerous driving after his terrifying journey. The pensioner's Micra collided with a Volkswagen Polo at junction 5 of the motorway after he attempted to do a u-turn. Both cars were badly damaged but the drivers escaped with minor injuries. Manchester Crown Court heard that Mr Walker, of Leng Road, Newton Heath, has suffered a number of other episodes of disorientation since that day and is undergoing tests for Alzheimer's disease. The court was told he was attempting to visit relatives in Wythenshawe in the afternoon when he mistakenly took the spur road for Manchester Airport and found himself going around the roundabout for terminals. Then, as he attempted to recover his way, he ended up travelling the wrong way down the spur road and the motorway itself. Drivers swerved to avoid Mr Walker as he hurtled towards them, with a Land Rover narrowly avoiding crashing into him. Then, in an ill-fated bid to get out of . harm's way, he tried to do a u-turn at the exit slip, causing the smash . with the oncoming Polo in the eastbound carriageway at 4.30pm in the . afternoon on July 25 last year. When interviewed by police last October, he told police: 'It's one mistake I've made in 50 years - no one got hurt.' He went on to plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving . The pensioner drove in the wrong direction up the M56 near Manchester Airport and was forced to do a U-turn. Nick Flanagan, defending, told his sentencing hearing: 'The prognosis isn't clear, but if it's the onset of Alzheimer's it isn't something which quickly comes on - it's a gradual process that may go some way to explaining what happened on this occasion. 'The reality is this is a 77-year-old man who's never been in any trouble before and not likely to be again - he has no intention of driving.' Sentencing, Recorder Philip Curran made Mr Walker subject to a three-year conditional discharge and banned from the road for the same period. He will have to take an extended retest if he is to drive again. The judge told Manchester Crown Court that he would not ban Mr Walker for life as his difficulties might be treated . He told him: 'As you said to police, it was one error in 50 years, but it was a very serious error indeed and it could have led to your death and the deaths of others. That's why it is such a serious event. It must have been a frightening experience for you and the other road-users swerving to avoid you. 'You really should have pulled into the hard shoulder and stopped instead of trying to do a u-turn. 'You really did aggravate the situation, but I suspect that may happened because of the traumatic situation you were in.' The judge said it would be wrong to ban the pensioner for good, saying there was a possibility his difficulties could be treated, and that it was a matter for the driving authorities. As he left court, Mr Walker said: 'What I did, I've not done it on purpose.'","Colin Walker, 77, wreaked havoc on the M56 near Manchester Airport .

A boy aged five was hit by a car travelling at 30mph – and, incredibly, it was the car that came off worse. Doctors believe Jayden Channell survived because he has highly-flexible joints which are thought to have helped his body absorb the impact. While the car was left dented, Jayden was able to stand up immediately and walk away with only grazes and a bump to his head despite bouncing off the bonnet and being sent flying. 'He looked like a rag doll': Jayden Channell, five, was sent flying into the air after being hit by a car outside his home in Essex - but escaped unscathed thanks to a condition called hypermobility syndrome . Relief: Smiling Jayden, pictured with his mother Samantha Taplin, sustained barely a scratch when he was hit by the car on Bank Holiday Monday . Jayden has hypermobility syndrome, . which means he is double-jointed. The collagen in his skin and ligaments . is weaker than normal, making his joints looser and more stretchy so . that they can extend further than usual. His mother Samantha Taplin, 26, said: ‘If that had been an ordinary child there is no way they would have survived. ‘The doctors couldn’t believe he had . been hit by a car and his  condition had saved his life. He actually . left dents in the car, but all he had was a bump on his head and a . graze.’ Jayden was crossing the road as his . family loaded up their car at their home in Southend ready for a day out . on Bank Holiday Monday when he was struck. His mother watched in horror as he flew into the air off the bonnet before smashing into the ground. He was taken to hospital where he was given a clean bill of health and allowed home straight away. Miss Taplin said: ‘The road is very narrow and there are cars parked either side. ‘One minute there was nothing coming and the next this car appeared out of nowhere just as Jayden went to cross. ‘He hit the bonnet and got thrown up . the road. His body looked like a rag doll, but he just jumped up and ran . to the pavement. The car was doing about 30mph, but he just got right . up. It was terrible watching it.

Astonishing: The schoolboy, five, was rushed to hospital after being hit by the car - but only sustained a small graze and a bump on his head . ‘It was horrible though, every time I closed my eyes that night I could see it happen in my head.’ Miss Taplin, who is now  campaigning . for speed bumps along the road, added: ‘Someone was watching over him . that  day, but things could be so  much different.’ While Jayden’s condition means that he . can move his limbs into positions that others would find impossible, it . can cause fatigue and long-term pain and he receives regular specialist . care.","Jayden Channell has unusually supple joints due to hypermobility syndrome .

A knifeman who tried to kill two police officers while on licence from prison was jailed for life yesterday. John Onyenaychi, described as one of Britain’s most dangerous men, slashed PC Paul Madden’s throat with a Stanley knife in front of terrified commuters near a bus stop. The maniac lashed out at other officers and shouted: ‘Let me finish him off.’ PC Madden, 23, collapsed with wounds to his neck, throat and face and would have died within three minutes through blood loss. But he was spotted by Samad  Tadjkarimi, 65, a retired heart surgeon who applied pressure to his neck to keep him alive long enough to receive emergency surgery. Mr Tadjkarimi, who was doing his Christmas shopping in the area, had retired three weeks earlier. He said: ‘It’s very humbling that my intervention perhaps contributed to the outcome of possibly saving his life – a very brave young officer. ‘It’s my duty. I’m sure anyone in my profession would do the same.’ During his rampage in Ealing, west London, Onyenaychi stabbed Police Community Support Officer Piotr Dolata twice in the head as he tried to help. Mr Dolata, 27, needed 12 stitches. PC Madden was also attacked and another PCSO, Steven Constable, was slashed twice but escaped serious injury because the thickness of his high-visibility jacket saved him. Onyenaychi, of Stratford, east London, was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, robbery and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. Judge Peter Beaumont, the Recorder of London, gave him two life sentences and ordered him to serve a minimum of 25 years after a nine-day trial at the Old Bailey. Crazed: John Onyenaychi (left) has been jailed for life for trying to kill Pc Madden, pictured here outside today's hearing at the Old Bailey, and another police officer in a horrific attack in Ealing last December . Bloody aftermath: Onyenaychi slashed Pc Madden's throat with a knife in . front of horrified onlookers in New Broadway, Ealing, then begged to be . allowed to 'finish him off' as officers tried to restrain him . Outside court Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said:  ‘He is one of the most dangerous men in Britain.’ Onyenaychi, who has committed violent . offences since the age of  12, was out on licence from a two-year prison . sentence for causing death by dangerous driving while high on drugs. The attack on the three officers last . December was the culmination of a six-day ‘crime spree of lethal and . extreme violence’, said Brian Altman QC, prosecuting. He told the jury that 6ft 2in . Onyenaychi ‘is a highly dangerous individual who thinks nothing of . carrying a knife on him, a tool of his trade, and uses it as a lethal . weapon when he wishes to do so’. Mr Altman said Onyenaychi became agitated when challenged about his ticket on a bus in Ealing. PCSOs recognised him by a distinguishing mark under his right eye as a man wanted for a previous attack. Bearing the scars: A computer-generated handout (left) shows the injuries Pc Madden sustained to his head and neck, while PCSO Piotr Dolata needed 12 stitches to his head after he was also attacked by Onyenaychi . When PC Madden arrived, he thought Onyenaychi might be armed and tried to arrest him. ‘Without warning, the defendant ripped his hands from his pockets and moved towards the policeman,’ said Mr Altman. After an initial attack, he pulled the . officer ‘close in and, with force, cut him across the throat’. He . stabbed PC Madden three or four times before colleagues were able to . intervene. Four days earlier, Onyenaychi stabbed a . man five times, causing serious wounds, at a minicab office in . Brentford, west London, after a failed robbery.

Shylon Wishart, 19, and James Cartwright, 18, beat 23-year-old Shane Watson when he refused to give them a cigarette - because he didn't have any. The pair punched him to the ground and repeatedly stamped on his face before abandoning his body in Sedgeley, West Midlands. Killers: James Cartwright, 18, and Shylon Wishart, 19, who beat Shane Watson before taking photos of his body as he lay dying . When Shane's concerned girlfriend Kelly Handley, 19, rang her boyfriend because she had lost contact with him a male voice on the other end of the line chillingly told her he had been 'dealt with'. Kelly rushed to Shane's home and told his mother Jane that she couldn't find her boyfriend. The pair went out searching for him and eventually found him lying in . the alleyway, his face swollen beyond recognition and covered in blood. Although they called the emergency services, he died from severe head injuries shortly afterwards. After carrying out their attack, Wishard and Cartwright took pictures on their phones and boasted to others about what they had done at a party. Victim: Shane Watson, 23, who was so badly injured that his mother and girlfriend could barely recognise him when they found his body in an alleyway . Cartwright pleaded guilty to murder . earlier this year and Wishart was found guilty after a seven day trial . at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday. The pair were warned they will face life behind bars when they are sentenced for the attack in the early hours of July 27 last year. Murder detectives arrested Cartwright and Wishart within hours at their respective homes on the afternoon of 28 July. Judge John Warner told them: 'The only thing to determine is the minimum term you serve before you can be considered for release.' Mr Peter Grieves-Smith, prosecuting, told the court: 'Their attack was characterised by gratuitous violence and a desire to humiliate the deceased. 'Their callous indifference to the fate of Shane Watson was matched by their mocking of the deceased's girlfriend. 'They must have known how concerned she was and yet her calls were answered in a way calculated to cause further distress.' Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Nigel Harrison, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The community was shocked and dumbfounded by the circumstances around Shane's death. 'We will never know the reason why Wishart and Cartwright attacked Shane on that night but we do know that they boasted about this vicious attack to partygoers later that night. 'I hope that this conviction will provide some shred of comfort to Shane's family and friends. Our thoughts remain with them at this very difficult time.' Murder scene: The narrow alleyway where Shane Watson, 23, was attacked in July last year . Shane's parents Jane and Steven Watson, described their son as a peacemaker and said the attack was their 'worst nightmare'. 'Shane was a fun loving, family orientated man. He always acted as a peacemaker and would actively avoid trouble and do his best to calm situations down,' they said in a statement. 'His life revolved around his extended family, friends and looking after everyone. 'I struggle to put into words the scene that I was faced with when I saw Shane lying by himself in the alleyway. 'It would be any mother's worst nightmare but it is a reality for me. 'I relive the images in my head everyday and cannot erase the painful memory of seeing Shane and hearing the voices of the people responsible for such a nasty, cruel and degrading attack. 'The people responsible took his dignity, his life and my only son. We both idolised Shane, he was the single most important person in our lives and to see him so badly hurt has devastated us beyond words.'","Shylon Wishart, 19, and James Cartwright, 18, beat Shane Watson, 23, to death when he refused to give them a cigarette .

The driver's door was open at the time and Chedd ended up face-down on the floor having fallen from the driver's seat. Mrs . Bishop had been on a three-hour shopping spree with her husband Roy and . was walking back to her car at the time of the fatal incident. She . suffered serious injuries after becoming partially trapped under the . car in a pool of her own blood and died in King's College Hospital in . London at 8.40am on January 9. Chedd . denied the charge of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving . but it took jurors less than an hour to find her guilty following a . one-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. Following the verdict, Mrs Bishop's family paid tribute to 'a loving wife, mum and nana'. A statement released by her family said: 'She is dearly missed by her family and her many friends, who she loved to have around her.' During the trial, the jury of seven men and five women heard how Chedd - who has been driving since the age of 17 and says she has never even had a parking ticket - claimed she fainted and did not remember any of the incident. Giving evidence in court, she said: 'I was like a rock; like it wasn't me; like I wasn't there. 'It was like an out of body experience and I was shaking all over like I was lifting off the floor and I couldn't see anything or hear anything. 'I thought I was dead to be honest. I would not have driven carelessly on that day. I'm sorry that someone lost their life.' Claire Bishop, 71, who lived in Romney Gardens, Bexleyheath, was run over as she walked back to her car . Maidstone Crown Court heard Mrs Bishop had been on a three-hour shopping spree with her husband Roy and was walking back to her car at the time of the fatal incident . But prosecutor Catherine Donnelly hit back at Chedd's claims, saying: 'What happened was you were very careless that day and you must have put your foot down on the accelerator rather than the brake.' Speaking after the trial, investigating officer PC Glen Braidwood said: 'This was an extremely tragic case in which a number of errors led to an innocent bystander losing her life. 'It underlines the importance of driving with due care and attention at all times - not just when behind the wheel but when entering or exiting a vehicle. 'We will never know why Chedd did not use her handbrake or why she left the gearbox engaged in reverse. Losing focus for just a second led to a catastrophic series of events in which Mrs Bishop died and Chedd was left injured. 'That momentary error has had an immeasurable impact on a number of lives, Chedd's included. He added: 'I'd like to praise Mrs Bishop's family for their strength and courage in reliving those terrible events and speak for all of Kent Police when I say that our thoughts are with them as they try to come to terms with this tragedy. 'I hope today's result can bring them a measure of closure as they try to move on with their lives without Claire.' Chedd will be sentenced at the same court on July 15.","Dawn Chedd, 50, had failed to apply the handbrake to her automatic .

"By . Paul Bentley . UPDATED: . 11:58 EST, 2 September 2011 . A huge earthquake hit just south west of Alaska this morning, threatening a devastating tsunami. People living in coastal areas were told to leave their homes immediately and flee inland to higher ground after the 6.8 magnitude quake struck close to the Aleutian Islands, 1,031 miles away from Anchorage. Widespread damage was at one point feared across the West Coast - from British Columbia, Canada, to Washington - as towns braced themselves for oncoming waves. Frightening: The earthquake hit just over 1,000 miles south west of Anchorage, Alaska . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued the tsunami warning this morning, stating that residents should flee their homes immediately. 'Those feeling the earth shake, seeing unusual wave action, or the water level rising or receding may have only a few minutes before the tsunami arrival and should move immediately. 'Homes and small buildings are not designed to withstand tsunami impacts. Do not stay in these structures,' the warning read. Struck: The Aleutian Islands, south west of Alaska, where the quake hit . 'Earthquakes of this magnitude are known to generate tsunamis,' the message added. The quake, which struck at 6:55 a.m. EDT, was 22.1 miles deep, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The tsunami warning has since been cancelled but people in Pacific coastal regions outside California, Oregon, Washington, British . Columbia, and Alaska have been told to check updates for fear of damage. Damage: The National Cathedral in Washington DC had to be shut indefinitely to the public after last week's earthquake . Last week, terrifying tremors were felt in New York, Washington D.C. and as far north as Toronto when America's East Coast was struck by the biggest earthquake in over a century. Major buildings, including the Pentagon and the White House had to be evacuated and several top tourist attractions in Washington have been closed for safety reasons after the city was shaken by a 5.8-magnitude quake, which originated in Virginia. Flights from JFK in New York and Reagan National Airport in Washington were also temporarily suspended while the airports checked for runway damage.","Massive quake strikes off Aleutian Islands, just south west of Alaska .

Wales may be known for daffodils and dragons, but one man looks set to change that after becoming a global leader in the manufacturing of digeridoos. Ray Brook, 62, lives on Anglesey, but his musical instruments have been sold internationally with orders even coming in from 21,000 miles away in Australia where they were invented. He now claims he is the world's most prolific manufacturer having single-handedly making more than 25,000 4ft digeridoos since first crafting one in the 1970s while living in New York. Working progress: Musician Ray Brook, 62, pictured in his workshop in Rhosneigr, Anglesey, Wales, where he makes his hand-crafted didgeridoos . Ray Brook spends hours making each didgeridoo out of bamboo before using a blow torch to decorate them . Many of his customers are based in Australia - 21,000 miles away from his home in Rhosneigr on the Island of Anglesey in North Wales, pictured . He also makes flutes from bamboo at his home workshop in Rhosneigr, Anglesey, and both instruments are selling across the globe, including down under. Mr Brook makes the instruments out of bamboo and uses a blow torch to decorate them. In the 1990s he was making up to 2,000 didgeridoos every year and still produces up to 1,000 every 12 months. Traditional didgeridoos from the northern parts of Australia are primarily made from the hollow branches of eucalyptus trees. But Mr Brook, a father-of-four, who lives in Rhosneigr in North Wales, says didgeridoos made out of bamboo are easier to play and produce a better sound. He said: 'I feel like the man who has sold sand to the Arabs and coals to Newcastle. usually sell them at craft fairs but sales of my stuff online have spread and to people from every corner of the world - including Australia who particularly like my flutes. Top quality: Ray Brook sells his instruments, which he makes in his workshop in Anglesey, North Wales, to countries all over the world - including Australia where they were first invented 1,500 years ago . New creation: Traditional didgeridoos from northern parts of Australia are made out of the branches of eucalyptus trees but Mr Brook says making them out of bamboo makes them easier to play and gives a better sound . 'It's incredible when you think I live in Wales. I don't know of anyone else making didgeridoos around here.' Born in the UK but raised in Canada, Mr Brooks played recorder, flute, saxophone and oboe as a child and started teaching himself to make wooden flutes as a teenager. 'I enjoyed making things and had some bamboo lying around, so a friend and I started making flutes by cutting up wood and using a hot screwdriver to make the holes.' Mr Brook first realised he could make a business of selling his creations after he moved to the United States. The father-of-four started making didgeridoos in the 70s as a hobby and it progressed from there into a business. Business: Ray Brook, pictured in his workshop with his didgeridoos and walking stick flutes, makes his instruments in batches of 30 and sell them for up to £45 each . Pieces of art: Ray Brook is considered to be the most prolific solo manufacturers of the instrument . He added: 'I enjoyed making things . and had some bamboo lying around, so a friend and I started making . flutes by cutting up wood and using a hot screwdriver to make the holes. 'I was living in New York and realised that you could sell anything if it was made to a good standard. 'So . I looked up some bamboo suppliers in the Yellow Pages and sold my . flutes in Central Park. They sold well despite not being in tune. 'I moved back to the UK and was selling them at craft fairs and festivals. They were very successful. Now I do shows around the country and they sell all around the world. 'Over the years I have sold thousands and thousands of didgeridoos and I've been making them for 24 years. There is probably not anyone in the world who has made more than me.' He sells the instruments for up to £45 each and makes them in batches of 30. Successful: Ray Brook started making the didgeridoos as a hobby before he realised he could turn his passion into a business . Carving out a reputation: Ray Brook, who lives in Rhosneigr on the Island of Anglesey in North Wales, has been making instruments including flutes and didgeridoos for over 30 years . Mr Brook said: 'As soon as I started . making them it took over my life. I had to learn how to make them in . tune, which took about three years. The thing about bamboo is that no . two pieces are the same, so you have to get to know the material to get . the tuning right. 'I . make my didgeridoos with bamboo, which is a lovely material; it's very . resonant and easier to play than a hardwood didgeridoo, which would be . made out of eucalyptus in Australia.' Versatile: Talented musician Ray Brook claims the didgeridoo is one of the easiest instruments to play . He has visited the instrument's native land and says his versions measure up to the originals. 'I have been to Australia and it's nice to know that mine compare to the indigenous didgeridoos. 'It's one of the easiest instruments to play. All you have to do is blow a raspberry down a tube. It sounds a bit rough at first but it doesn't take long to get better. 'It's the circular breathing which takes time and allows you to go without stopping. 'In the 1990s, it was a really big thing so a lot of people got on the bandwagon. People used to take them to festivals, but that fizzled out. 'I don't sell the volume that I used to, but I now sell them at craft fairs and to people from every corner of the world on my website. 'I used to say every home should have a didgeridoo. Now I say that every home should have three!' The didgeridoo was developed by Indigenous Australians of northern Australia around 1,500 years ago and still in widespread use today both in Australia and around the world. It is sometimes described as a natural wooden trumpet or 'drone pipe'. Musicologists classify it as a brass aerophone. Archaeological studies of rock art in Northern Australia suggest that the people of the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls.

The evidence of a psychiatrist accused of distorting reports to suit the needs of local authorities is still being used to remove children from their parents. One mother faced the prospect of having a baby son taken away from her because of a report written by Dr George Hibbert six years ago – before the child in question was even born. The doctor is at the centre of an investigation over claims that he falsely diagnosed parents with mental disorders to fit with the view of social services. Dr George Hibbert, facing clams he deliberately misdiagnosed patients . He has already offered to surrender his doctor's licence following the claims – but has been told the allegations are so serious he must face a public hearing. Now the Mail Online has learned that his reports – for which he has been paid millions by local authorities – are still being used in the secret family courts against parents he labelled 'unfit'. One woman, who can be named only as Miss C, had her two daughters taken away after she failed one of Dr Hibbert's controversial 'parenting assessments' in 2006. In a bizarre report, he criticised Miss C for speaking to her elder daughter 'in an over-bright tone', vacuuming the floor 'in an agitated way' and even on one occasion, for 'overcooking the pasta'. He also expressed concern that her youngest daughter, who was just two months old, spent too much time 'asleep, wrapped in blankets'. Claims have been made by a woman known as Miss B, about how her daughter, now six, was taken away from her mother due to a report by psychiatrist Dr George Hibbert . He concluded she was 'unable to protect the children from harm' because she was 'preoccupied' by what other people thought of her. As a result of the report, the mother was forced to endure the agony of having her two children taken away – and placed in the care of her abusive ex-partner. 'I couldn't believe it,' she said. 'They are everything to me. To have them taken away was awful for me but much worse for them. My eldest daughter was utterly traumatised.' Determined to get her daughters back, Miss C fought a long legal battle and eventually won the right to care for her two daughters unsupervised for one day a week. When she gave birth to another baby earlier this year, a parenting assessment found 'no concerns' about Miss C's ability to look after the child, who was 'happy' and 'contented' in her care. But despite this, her local authority started proceedings to have the boy removed and adopted – citing Dr Hibbert's six-year-old report on her parenting capabilities as evidence she was an unfit mother. 'It was like being in a nightmare' she said. 'Everybody knows I'm a good mother. But Dr Hibbert's report is like a black cloud hanging over everything. It just seems so wrong that they could still have used his reports in court to take my baby away, even though he's being investigated and all these people have come forward.' The General Medical Council is investigating a string of claims by women who say their children were wrongly removed as a result of Dr Hibbert's reports. At least one former member of staff at his Assessment centre – Tadpole Cottage in Blunsdon, Wiltshire – is understood to have come forward in support of the parents. Earlier this year, Dr Hibbert, an eminent psychiatrist who has lectured at Oxford and advised MPs on the family courts, offered to surrender his doctor's licence after being confronted with allegations that he had deliberately misdiagnosed patients with mental disorders. But the GMC dismissed his request and has said it expects to hold a Fitness to Practise Hearing early next year. Dr Hibbert is now seeking permission of the High Court to challenge the GMC's decision to investigate one complaint that falls outside the usual five-year time limit for investigations. Meanwhile a number of women have contacted a solicitors' firm in Manchester regarding civil claims against the psychiatrist. In a statement, Dr Hibbert said: 'I have had one complaint referred to the GMC's Fitness to Practise Panel for a hearing, a complaint that relates to a case in 2007, but no hearing date has yet been fixed. 'There are other complaints that the GMC are investigating but their investigations in these other cases are at a preliminary stage and none of them has been referred to the GMC's Fitness to Practise Panel.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Dr George Hibbert is at the centre of an investigation over .
