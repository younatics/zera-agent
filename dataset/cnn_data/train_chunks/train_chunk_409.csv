"The United States has a history of often picking sides in Middle East conflicts to its own detriment. In the 1980s, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein to establish a relationship that helped the dictator gain access to American arms during Iraq's war with Iran. In the 1990s, the U.S. would drive former ally Hussein from Kuwait and impose a decade of sanctions that were devastating for Iraqis, but had little effect on the dictator. In 2003, we went to Iraq, overthrew Hussein, and became part of nation-building effort from which we only recently saw most of our soldiers return home. Arguably one of the greatest beneficiaries of the Iraq war was Iran, which now enjoys more power and influence with the elimination of its historic enemy. President George H.W. Bush did not pursue Hussein directly during Operation Desert Storm precisely because he feared the destabilizing effects it might have on the region, or as his Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney explained in 1994, ""Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you going to put in its place?"" Today, Iraq is unstable and its future uncertain. Moammar Gadhafi eventually accepted responsibility in the 1988 bombing of an airplane over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed hundreds of people, including American schoolchildren. President Reagan called Gadhafi the ""mad dog of the Middle East."" Fast forward to 2008, when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice traveled to Libya to meet with Gadhafi to offer American support. In 2009, members of the U.S. Senate -- Republicans Lindsey Graham  and John McCain and an independent, Joe Lieberman --  would travel to Libya to meet with Gadhafi to offer further aid.  Sen. McCain said: ""We discussed the possibility of moving ahead with the provision of nonlethal defense equipment to the government of Libya."" President Obama would eventually meet with Gadhafi to reconfirm the same relationship established during the Bush administration. By 2011, President Obama was arming Libyan rebels and ordering airstrikes to overthrow Gadhafi. Some of the president's most vocal supporters were the same Republicans who traveled to Libya two years before to help Libya's strongman acquire military equipment. Sen. McCain said of the Libyan rebels: ""I have met with these brave fighters, and they are not al Qaeda. ... To the contrary: They are Libyan patriots who want to liberate their nation. We should help them do it."" We did help them, something I opposed on the Senate floor as an unconstitutional overreach by the executive branch. We now have reason to believe that the Libyan rebels did contain elements of al Qaeda and other Islamic extremists. Visit strengthens McCain's resolve for U.S. intervention in Syria . Now we see the same enthusiasm for another U.S. intervention, this time in Syria. The Syria Transition Support Act approved last week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, has the potential to create more problems for the United States than it would solve. It is unclear what national security interests we have in the  civil war in Syria. It is very clear that any attempt to aid the Syrian rebels would be complicated and dangerous, precisely because we don't know who these people are. The situation in Syria is certainly dire. At least 70,000 people have died, and al Qaeda is making confirmed inroads into the country. No one wants to see Syria become a bastion of extremism. But like other American interventions in the past, U.S. involvement could actually help the extremists. There is also the quandary of nearly 2 million Christians who are uncertain of what to do.  The Christian community in Syria has traditionally sided with, and been protected by, Bashar al-Assad's regime. It is troubling to think that American arms may be given to Islamic fighters who may in turn be firing them at Christians. This month, it was reported that the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in Syria executed 11 men who were part of al-Assad's forces. Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is no friend to the U.S. --  but neither is al Qaeda. To aid members of al Qaeda in any way, directly or indirectly, is an insult to our brave men and women who've been fighting these terrorists since 9/11. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this ""transition support act"" is that it would commit the United States to a leadership position in the restoration of Syria, and is very vague about what that looks like. The language of ""capacity building"" contained in this act is an open-ended term that if logically followed, could eventually mean U.S. troops on the ground in Syria. We ""capacity built"" in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Those who insist this language could never mean U.S. boots on the ground in Syria belong to the same Washington clique eager to support Hussein, Ghadafi and later, the Libyan rebels. Washington is not exempt from the law of unintended consequences. Empowering Islamic extremists to achieve questionable short-term goals does not serve America's long-term security or interests. Nor does it serve the interests of nearly 2 million Christians in Syria who  fear they could suffer the same fate as Iraqi Christians who were abused and expelled from that country as radical Islamic forces gained influence and power. These Christians are natural allies of the United States, and if we're going to seriously discuss any American interests in Syria, the welfare of these Christians is more important than arming Islamic extremists. History's primary lesson is that we must learn from the past. Although there are some well-intentioned reasons for wanting to intervene in Syria, there are far more well-documented reasons not to.","Rand Paul: U.S. has a habit of picking the wrong sides in Mideast conflicts .

"Steve Tobak, a California-based management consultant, recalls the agonizing one-on-one meetings he sat through years ago with a micromanaging boss. But when one day the boss changed tack and asked him to go on walks instead, it transformed their working and personal relationship. ""Somehow, when we were outside under the blue sky, getting a little exercise, he lightened up. We got along great after that,"" Tobak says. ""It was amazing."" Group meetings where everyone is standing up have caught on in the past few years. But for one-on-one conversations, the trend at forward-thinking firms is to hold meetings while walking. Steve Jobs, the late founder of Apple, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey of Twitter have all been known to favor walking meetings. Recently, Nilofer Merchant, a former technology executive, extolled the benefits of walk-and-talk meetings at a TED conference, noting the health advantages and the closer connections people form when away from the more traditional setting of a conference room. ""By walking side by side, it reinforces the perspective that you're working on something together,"" Merchant says. Merchant, who previously worked for Apple, the software company Autodesk and a slew of other technology firms, said the decision to hold meetings while walking was born out of her own health concerns. She was frustrated about not being able to fit enough exercise into her week. After starting this style of meeting, it no longer was a choice between getting things done and staying healthy, she says, ""because I could potentially do both at the same time."" See also: Sick of meetings? Make them matter . Walking meetings now account for about 70% of the exercise Merchant gets per week, she says. She still fits in a run or a gym session once a week. But she has found it difficult to persuade colleagues to go on walking meetings, partly because of the ingrained ideas of what a meeting should entail. ""The cultural norm is to sit, which is why sitting is the smoking of our generation:  everyone does it, and it's so common, asking someone to be active definitely seems weird to everyone I ask,"" she says. ""Also, some people are ashamed of how unfit they are."" There are practical concerns as well. Those asked to go on walks frequently wonder how to take notes and are uneasy about being away from their mobile devices. But Merchant says that she still jots down notes on walks when an important point comes up and that cell phones are just distractions during meetings. ""Walking meetings result in undivided attention because the mobile device isn't within eyesight, tempting you to step away from the moment,"" she says. See also: Dying careers and thriving careers . Executives in Silicon Valley are not the only ones who see the value of getting the blood flowing during the workday. Research by fitness experts has shown that the simple act of getting up helps office employees think better. Jack Groppel, vice president of Wellness & Prevention, a consulting group owned by Johnson & Johnson, has advocated a program that calls for standing up and walking around in the workplace for one or two minutes about every half hour, a process that he says would increase productivity. Groppel says when workers start moving, it triggers a slight raise in heart rate for the first minute or two, meaning more oxygen is getting to the brain. ""What we did find in the studies that we did, after 90 days of doing this, people felt increased amounts of energy, they felt increased focus, they felt improved engagement,"" he says. But the idea is not to be taking a break from work. ""What we're saying is you can move and function while being productive,"" Groppel says, suggesting people take a document to read while they walk. For this concept to catch on, corporate leaders would need to endorse the idea of routinely standing up to stretch during group meetings, Groppel says. ""Leaders have to be very involved, giving permission and role modeling them."" As for walking meetings, Tobak sees another obstacle for them to gain traction in the workplace: ""People seem to be getting more and more lazy and sedentary, not less.""","A former technology executive is advocating holding meetings while on walks .

"(CNN) -- Four-star Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli -- the No. 2 general in the U.S. Army -- says he is absolutely not offended that Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett mistook him for a waiter at a fancy Washington dinner this week and asked him for a glass of wine. It could have happened to anybody, Chiarelli tells CNN. ""It was an honest mistake that ANYONE could have made. She was sitting, I was standing and walking behind her and all she saw were the two stripes on my pants which were almost identical to the waiters pants -- REALLY. She apologized and will come to the house for dinner if a date can be worked out in March,"" Chiarelli wrote in an e-mail. In fact, when military personnel wear their dress uniforms of short jacket and striped trousers to black-tie parties, they themselves often make jokes to each other about waiting tables. Chiarelli, a veteran of Iraq, wears a chestful of medals, which Jarrett apparently did not see. The incident was first reported on the website Daily Caller, which said Chiarelli, who oversees the Army's programs to help ill and wounded troops from the war, went ahead and got Jarrett a glass of wine. Chiarelli tells CNN that's not exactly what happened. ""As a 'laugh' I poured her a glass of wine -- it was only good fun. Yes, it was an honest mistake and anyone who says otherwise is trying to make it something it was not,"" Chiarelli said. Sometime, embarrassing stuff happens. Even in Washington, folks.","Obama adviser asks No. 2 Army general for wine .

"The University of North Carolina failed some of its students ""for years"" by allowing them to take classes that did not match its own academic standards, Chancellor Carol Folt has admitted. The concession -- the strongest since UNC-Chapel Hill was caught up in a fake-class scandal two years ago -- comes just weeks after a CNN investigation found continuing problems at UNC and other public universities where some student-athletes could read only at an elementary school level. Two years ago, it was exposed that UNC students, many of them athletes, were given grades for classes they did not attend and for which they did nothing beyond turning in a single paper. One professor has been indicted on fraud charges for being paid for a class he didn't teach. The university has always maintained it was an isolated case, but Folt is now acknowledging a broader problem. ""We also accept the fact that there was a failure in academic oversight for years that permitted this to continue,"" Folt told UNC trustees last week. ""This, too, was wrong. And it has undermined our integrity and our reputation."" CNN analysis: Some college athletes play like adults, read like 5th-graders . CNN has asked UNC Chapel Hill for the number of students who were specially admitted because they did not meet the usual academic standards and who majored in or took the classes now acknowledged as fake. CNN investigated the issue of poor academics among student football and basketball players after a researcher at UNC revealed that some could not read well enough to follow news coverage about themselves or even read the word ""Wisconsin."" The researcher, Mary Willingham, said student-athletes were among those who took the fake classes, though she said the classes were just a symptom of the problem of enrolling athletes in the money-making sports of football and basketball who could not succeed academically by themselves. While questioning Willingham's credibility and CNN's reporting, UNC has launched its own investigation into the claims that too many of its student-athletes read poorly. And the university's executive vice chancellor and provost, James Dean, told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had commissioned an internal study into African and African-American studies at the university. That's where the fake classes originated. UNC spokeswoman Karen Moon said Tuesday that as part of the study, Dean is ""interested in better understanding the formation of the department as part of our ongoing efforts to assess the overall academic environment at the University."" UNC had previously done an internal investigation, and told CNN last fall that it implemented changes based on what its internal report found. Some 120 changes were made and UNC told CNN they felt that was sufficient to ensure it knew what happened and to make sure it would not happen again. Dean told Bloomberg Businessweek, whose parent company's chairman is a UNC trustee, that he would investigate whether student-athletes were ""clustering"" in departments or classes that were supposed to have easy grades and to see whether there were any other forces or personalities behind the scandal. UNC told CNN last year it has a program that alerts it if too many athletes are enrolled in a single class, but it's not yet clear whether this is different. Neither Dean nor Folt were in their positions when the fake classes were run. The NCAA, which oversees college sport, did investigate, but found none of its rules were broken. The NCAA told CNN on Monday it won't comment on whether the university will take a second look.

"(CNN) -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry demanded Tuesday that CNN's Jack Cafferty apologize for remarks he made last week, in which he called the Chinese ""goons and thugs"" and said products manufactured in China are ""junk."" ""Cafferty used the microphone in his hands to slander China and the Chinese people (and) seriously violated professional ethics of journalism and human conscience,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said Tuesday, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. She said Cafferty's remarks ""reflected his arrogance, ignorance and hostility towards the Chinese people, ignited indignation of Chinese (at) home and abroad and will be condemned by those who safeguard justice around the world."" CNN issued a statement Tuesday saying: ""We are aware of concerns about Jack Cafferty's comments related to China in the context of the upcoming Olympics, which were broadcast on The Situation Room on April 9, 2008. ""CNN would like to clarify that it was not Mr. Cafferty's, nor CNN's, intent to cause offense to the Chinese people, and [CNN] would apologize to anyone who has interpreted the comments in this way. ""CNN is a network that reports the news in an objective and balanced fashion. However, as part of our coverage we also employ commentators who provide robust opinions that generate debate. ""On this occasion Jack was offering his strongly held opinion of the Chinese government, not the Chinese people --- a point he subsequently clarified on The Situation Room on April 14. ""It should be noted that over many years, Jack Cafferty has expressed critical comments on many governments, including the U.S. government and its leaders."" Cafferty, who appears daily on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" made the remarks as host Wolf Blitzer was comparing today's China to that of 20 or 30 years ago. ""I don't know if China is any different, but our relationship with China is certainly different,"" Cafferty said. ""We're in hock to the Chinese up to our eyeballs because of the war in Iraq, for one thing. They're holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of our paper. We are also running hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of trade deficits with them, as we continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food and export, you know, jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to turn out the stuff that we're buying from Wal-Mart. ""So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed,"" he said. ""I think they're basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years."" He issued a clarification of his remarks on Monday's ""Situation Room,"" saying that by ""goons and thugs,"" he meant the Chinese government, not the Chinese people. It was unclear whether China's Foreign Ministry was aware of the clarification when it held the Tuesday news conference. In the days following his remarks, however, the Legal Immigrant Association launched an online petition condemning his statements as ""racist"" and ""despicable"" and demanding that CNN discipline Cafferty and apologize to the Chinese people. Nearly 45,000 people had signed it as of Tuesday afternoon. In the petition, the association describes itself as ""a leading organization of legal immigrants mainly comprised of people from China."" According to its Web site, the nonprofit group is based in Santa Clara, California, and was founded in 2007 as an organization ""dedicated to the social well-being of employment-based immigrant professionals."" The state-run English-language newspaper China Daily also said in an editorial Tuesday that an apology is called for, calling Cafferty ""pathetic"" and noting, ""it is rare for the world audience to hear such a blatant discrimination against an ethnic group of people with such a derogatory connotation."" Others angered by Cafferty's remarks were urging a boycott of CNN's advertisers. E-mail to a friend .","Cafferty said Chinese are ""goons and thugs"" and products are ""junk""

"Paris (CNN)The terrorist attacks in France last week have revealed serious breaches and lapses in the French system of intelligence, surveillance and security, according to numerous counterterrorism experts, including former government officials. The rips in the so-called intelligence ""net"" reveal gaps that led directly to the tragic events that have gripped Paris and the rest of France for days and also raise serious security concerns for the future here and abroad, more than a half dozen experts on security and terrorism told CNN. And it couldn't come at a worse time. The brazen murders of 17 innocent people, in three separate attacks in as many days, has led to a fabled city shaken, shocked and in mourning. The new concerns raise the serious possibility that national security and surveillance of suspected terrorists in France will need to be increased or totally reviewed and revamped to provide better safety for the nation as a whole, some experts told CNN. And with one of the suspected terrorists still on the loose of as Sunday night and new reports of ""sleeper cells"" being activated, the security concerns are only amplified. On Saturday, French police were told in a briefing that sleeper cells have been activated over the past 24 hours inside France, terror expert Samuel Laurent said he had been told by a police source. He said officers were told to erase all visible online presence on social media and keep their weapons on themselves at all times, he said. ""There is a huge security failure those people were all considered as extremely dangerous,"" said Laurent, a French expert who has written several books on terror groups, their actions and jihadism. ""They were all supposed to be monitored. In the U.S., they were on a no-fly list. So we can ask the question whether the U.S. is more able to monitor French jihadis on French territory than the French intelligence itself,"" said Laurent. One of the most common complaints heard by experts: simple math showing aspiring terrorists in France having the upper hand. One former director of a French counterterrorism unit put it in these terms: ""There are far too many of them, and far too few of us,"" he said, asking to speak anonymously because he did not have permission to speak to reporters. ""We cannot possibly keep track of them all, and we are seriously outnumbered,"" he said. Two other former French terrorist officials agreed. Jean-Charles Brisard, head of the French Center for Analysis of Terrorism, put it like this: ""To put someone under surveillance, you need two things. You need a good reason -- you need to believe someone is going to be radicalized, that someone is going to become violent. ""The second thing you need is resources. You need 25 agents ... to survey them physically, his phone, his laptops, iPads whatever. It is virtually impossible to put surveillance on 3,000 to 5,000 people in France who we know now are radicalized,"" he said. Beyond concerns about the state of simple surveillance, experts point out other issues in the fight against terrorism. They're worried about the proliferation of jihadi videos on social media, the growth of radical jihadi preaching and the relative ease with which citizens of France can get into Turkey and across the Syrian border. The week of terror began at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, where 12 journalists and others were murdered in close quarters, leaving a gruesome and violent crime scene behind the likes of which Paris has not seen in years. The attackers were two brothers who were well-known to authorities and who would seemingly call out for increased surveillance and scrutiny. Cherif and Said Kouachi were orphans and had criminal records. The younger brother, Cherif, was actually prosecuted and jailed for his ties to a jihadist recruitment ring in the northeast quadrant of Paris. The ring, known by name for a park where they met, the Buttes-Chaumont, was recruiting young disaffected Parisian Muslims to join in the Iraq War as jihadis against American forces. Three of the young recruits wound up in Falluja, where American forces died in numerous fierce battles. Cherif Kouachi was arrested in 2005 when he was about to leave for Iraq. He was sentenced to three years in prison in 2008. But Cherif didn't serve any time after the conviction -- the judge ruled that his pretrial detention had been enough. Still, his radicalization was well-known to officials, spelled out in detailed court documents back in 2007. The documents, obtained in conjunction with L'Express, show Cherif had a long history of jihadist aspirations, including going to Iraq to ""combat the Americans"" for the ""injustices"" they had ""inflicted on Iraqis."" In 2010, Cherif was connected with a foiled plot to help a convicted terrorist escape from jail, though there was not enough evidence to send him back to jail. During his stint behind bars, Cherif met Djamel Beghal, a jihadi who was jailed for plotting to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Beghal, a known al Qaeda recruiter, was also connected to Amedy Coulibaly, who died the same day as the two brothers after he killed several hostages at a kosher grocery store in eastern Paris. At times before and after his stint in jail, Cherif Kouachi was under surveillance by French authorities. But several former top French government officials told CNN he had ""dropped off"" priority lists this past summer and was less carefully monitored. Cherif's older brother, Said, traveled to Yemen in 2011, according to a U.S. official for three or more months and is believed to have trained with al Qaeda while he was there. Coulibaly was also known by French authorities. He, too, had a criminal past with jihadi links. Like Cherif, he was connected to the plot to free a convicted terrorist from jail. A Western intelligence source told CNN that Coulibaly was arrested in connection with the plot known as BELKACEM Project in May of 2010. He was in possession of 240 rounds of ammo for a Kalishnikov. While he was awaiting trial for the foiled plot, Cherif visited Coulibaly, according to the Western intelligence source. Despite all these well-known links to terror concerns, and even the links between Coulibaly and Cherif, all three attackers seem to have largely dropped from French surveillance priorities up to the moment they were linked to the ongoing attacks. ""We know that the level of alert has been lowered in 2014,"" said Laurent. But he said the level of alert could and should have been raised. Speaking just about the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly, Laurent said:  ""Actually, they could not be considered as a lower-level threat. Those people were extremely dangerous, they were very motivated and the French have made a huge mistake by letting them off the radar or allowing them such a level of freedom in terms of operating, finance and preparing this attack,"" he said. Brisard, head of the French Center for the Analysis of Terror, agreed. Coulibaly had made several phone calls to target police in France. Coulibaly is believed to have killed a French policewoman on Thursday.  He was killed during the hostage attack on the kosher market on Friday. While not known previously, it is now believed the Kouachi brothers' jihadism extended beyond Iraq, to Yemen and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. During their rampage, the Kouachi brothers had told witnesses they were ""avenging the Prophet."" On the day of their final shootout and deaths, French station BFM says it spoke with both Cherif Kouachi and Coulibaly. The men both gave details of their jihadist Yemeni ties. They said, independently, that they were financed and supported by Anwar al-Awlawki, the American-born cleric who became the a key jihadi leader in Yemen and was killed by Americans several years ago. The ties to Yemen and al Qaeda prompted many of the experts speaking to CNN to raise even more security concerns for the future. Said Kouachi is suspected of slipping off for terror training in Yemen in July 2011 during a trip he made with another French national to Oman in July 2011, according to multiple French officials who spoke to L'Express national security reporter, Eric Pelletier. Pelletier shared the details of his reporting with CNN. U.S. intelligence agencies developed intelligence suggesting a high probability he slipped across to Yemen during the trip to Oman, and informed their French counterparts, according to Pelletier's French sources. The French responded by placing Said Kouachi under surveillance in November 2011 by issuing a ""Fiche de Surveillance"" notice, multiple French officials told Pelletier. The surveillance was conducted by both DGSI, France's domestic security service and later by the judicial police. Wiretaps were authorized for his cell phones and that of his brother Cherif. But the surveillance of Said was terminated in June 2014 because French security services judged him no longer dangerous, Pelletier was told. The surveillance of his brother Cherif stopped earlier -- at the end of 2013. Cherif's phone calls suggested he had disengaged with violent extremism and was focusing on counterfeiting clothing and shoes. ""The fact that al Qeada's affiliate in Yemen pulled off the most deadly terrorist attack in Europe in a decade speaks for itself,"" said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen, an expert on al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. ""Groups like al Qaeda in Yemen, as well as ISIS and other jihadist groups in the Middle East, are likely to continue to be a problem in Europe for the foreseeable future."" ""Hindsight is, of course, always 20/20. In the case of a large-scale terrorist attack, there is often intelligence in the system that was overlooked before the event,"" said Bergen. ""The CIA, for instance, knew that two men associated with al Qaeda were living in the United States who later turned out to be among the hijackers of the flight that crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11; the lead bomber in the London bombings of 2005 was known to British law enforcement, and the Fort Hood shooter, Major Nidal Hasan, had come to the attention of the FBI because of emails he exchanged before the attack with Anwar al-Awlaki, an al Qaeda leader based in Yemen. ""This time it's the French that dropped the ball, but this is not a problem particular to France.""","Security will need to be increased or totally reviewed, expert and analysts tell CNN .

"The Coast Guard didn't think Ron Ingraham could survive, stuck in a 25-foot sailboat for days as waves swelled 15 to 20 feet high. His son did. ""I don't feel like he's dead,""  Zakary Ingraham told a Coast Guard official nine days ago, after learning their search was ending. ""I don't feel it."" He was right. Ron Ingraham was picked up Tuesday morning about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Honolulu, ""weak, hungry and dehydrated"" and -- most importantly -- alive. His rescue came 12 days after he made his first distress call, a difficult stretch even for a veteran fisherman. But he wasn't beaten up enough to lose his priorities. According to his son, the 67-year-old Ron Ingraham told his rescuers, ""We ain't leaving without my boat."" So the sailor and his boat headed back to shore Wednesday. What will his dad do now that he's back on land? Will he relax, take some time off, maybe look for a less dangerous profession? ""I'm sure he's going to go fishing as soon as he's able,"" Zakary Ingraham said by phone from Missouri. ""Like tomorrow."" Son: Ron Ingraham is tough, strong, resourceful . Some people in their late 60s might be enjoying retirement or, at least, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. Not Ron Ingraham, whose son describes him as resourceful, physically strong and tough. ""You know who Rambo is?"" Zakary Ingraham joked. ""Rambo has a picture of my dad on his wall."" Fishing is his life and livelihood. Ron Ingraham lives on his boat and ""that's pretty much all he's got,"" his son said -- explaining his insistence his battered vessel, which he named Malia, be towed back to shore. He set off solo around Thanksgiving from Molokai on what should have been a normal trip, like many others he'd made over the years. It didn't turn out that way. He made distress calls on the holiday, indicating his boat was taking on water. Those calls spurred a search that would end up covering 12,000 square miles. It included an MH-65 helicopter, an HC-130 airplane and the 110-foot Coast Guard Cutter Kiska. But none of them could find Ron Ingraham or his boat. 'Mayday; small boat, in danger of sinking' On December 1, the Coast Guard called off its search. Zakary Ingraham said he was told that airplanes, but not satellites, picked up his father's emergency beacon -- suggesting it either had a weak battery or his boat was submerged. With rocky seas, the weather wasn't cooperating either. ""With the conditions the way they are, we couldn't find your dad's boat,"" Zakary Ingraham recalled a Coast Guard official telling him. ""We think it's sunk."" In fact, Ron Ingraham's boat was still afloat. And on Tuesday, he decided to give the distress call one more try. His life depended on it. ""This is a mayday, mayday, mayday,"" said Ingraham. ""... Small boat, in danger of sinking."" The U.S. Coast Guard heard the call and immediately dispatched the closest available boat -- the USS Paul Hamilton, a U.S. Navy destroyer, then about 14 miles away. They found Ingraham's masts broken and him using an auxiliary sail trying to get closer to land, his friend and fellow fisherman Dedrick Manaba told CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now. And, of course, there was Ingraham himself -- weary and battered, but still going, much to the relief of his friends and family. 'I was going backwards all night long' It all started, Ron Ingraham said, when a simple plan to get food and water before dark one night went awry after the weather took a turn for the worse. ""I tried all through the night. ... I couldn't make it. I was going backwards all night long,"" he told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB after his rescue. At one point, a massive wave crashed into his sailboat. The boat mast hit the water, Ingraham said, and so did he. ""But I had a rope on me (and) towed myself back in,"" Ingraham said. From there, he had no choice but to go where the current took him. Searchers had struggled to find him because weather pulled him hundreds of miles away from the area where they'd been looking, he said. ""I was way out there, and I was out of water, but I hydrated on fish,"" he said. ""I'm a fisherman, so I caught fish."" ""It wasn't as a good as a sushi bar,"" he said. But it was how he survived. ""He's alive after 12 days at sea,"" his son Zakary Ingraham said. ""I couldn't be happier.""","Ron Ingraham says he survived at sea by catching and eating fish .

"American football players and fans alike braved bone-chilling conditions in Green Bay Sunday during one of the coldest games in National Football League (NFL) history. The temperature at the Green Bay Packers' Lambeau Field in Wisconsin was measured at four degrees Fahrenheit, with wind chill causing the mercury to dip as low as minus 14 during the visit of the San Francisco 49ers. An arctic front pushing through the Midwest, which has become known as a ""polar vortex,"" was the reason for the frigid conditions, with players donning long sleeves and balaclavas beneath their helmets in a bid to keep warm during the seventh coldest game the league has ever seen. One player who persisted with short sleeves was 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who masterminded his team's 23-20 victory. Jim Harbaugh, coach of the San Francisco 49ers, was so concerned by the cold that he had asked Kaepernick, a Wisconsin native and childhood Packers fan, three times to wear more weather appropriate gear. ""I'm a little hardheaded at times,"" Kaepernick, who also played without gloves, told reporters. ""I played in cold-weather games before. I feel it's more mental than anything."" Lambeau Field is something of an ice fortress when it comes to the NFL's chilliest contests. The Packers' 1967 meeting with the Dallas Cowboys, dubbed the ""Ice Bowl"" was played despite the temperature dropping as low as minus 14 -- with the wind making it feel like minus 48 -- securing its title as the coldest game in NFL history.","The San Francisco 49ers beat the Green Bay Packers in freezing conditions .

"(CNN)If Muslims ""must be held responsible"" for last week's terror attacks in France, as media mogul Rupert Murdoch has said, does that make all Christians responsible for evil perpetuated by a small minority? The question is floating around social media in response to the News Corp. CEO's comments about Islam's ""growing jihadist cancer."" Author J.K. Rowling was among the first high-profile voices to challenge his argument over the weekend. Then, comedian Aziz Ansari joined in with the hashtag #RupertsFault, inviting others to contribute examples of ""all the evil s**t"" Christians must be responsible for under Murdoch's logic. He also asked Murdoch to advise on how Muslims like his ""60-year-old parents in North Carolina"" can help destroy terrorist groups. Murdoch ignited the controversy on Friday by tweeting, ""Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible."" He followed it up with, ""Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US. Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy."" Naturally, not everyone agreed. Rowling kicked things off, and others piled on, following Ansari's examples. If Muslims are to blame for last week's terror attacks, they argued, then Christians must be responsible for the following: . 1. The Spanish Inquisition, Christian fundamentalist violence ... and Jim Bakker. 2. The sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church . 3. Christian extremism . 4. The Holocaust . 5.

"There is no middle-of-the-road opinion on Rachel Jeantel, the ""friend, not-girlfriend"" of Trayvon Martin who testified in the George Zimmerman trial Wednesday and Thursday. Some people see a surly, unreliable witness who's been caught telling several whoppers over the past year. Others see your average working class teenage girl, trying her best to stay composed while retelling the story of the death of her close friend under the most grueling of circumstances. Which one did you see? It probably has a lot to do with what demographic boxes you check to identify yourself. Since Zimmerman was arrested, legal analysts have predicted that Martin's ""girlfriend,"" who was talking to him on the phone when he encountered Zimmerman last February, would be a crucial witness for both sides. For the prosecution, Jeantel establishes Martin as a scared teen who was trying to run away from a stranger (Zimmerman) on his way back home. For the defense, pointing out the various versions of events Jeantel gave in interviews with the press, Benjamin Crump and the police would be essential to poking holes in the prosecution story that started off strong on day one. But that's just strategy. The real impact of Jeantel is how a jury -- made up mostly of white women and mothers whose only knowledge of Martin comes from his friends and family -- would view this young girl. The moment Jeantel sat down on the witness stand and started talking, my Twitter account and the #Zimmerman timeline exploded with comments: . ""Her story has been inconsistent. I don't think the state should have called her, she'll never survive cross. Just seems mean."" ""She is a horrible witness. The repetitive nature of her testimony is uggg."" ""I would be pissed if my daughter/son talked & behaved this way while testifying"" ""Rachel Jeantel is being made fun of and slandered on Twitter because of her looks and the way she talks."" These were comments that exploded in the Twitterverse mere minutes into Jeantel's testimony. Why? Part of it is because she is a dark-skinned, plus-sized girl from a low-income neighborhood who doesn't speak the King's English. With that profile, some viewers automatically see her as non-credible and uneducated, and every frustrated or irritable word coming out of her mouth reinforced the stereotypes of black teens that all too many Americans (of all colors) believe in. This is key because most of Jeantel's criticism was expressed long before cross-examination, when the holes in her story were exposed. This doesn't mean that any juror or viewer who found Jeantel problematic is necessarily prejudiced or pro-Zimmerman. However, the swiftness with which she was viewed as a good or bad witness by some had more to do with how she looked than what she actually said. On the other side, an almost equal number of people -- mostly parents, young people, minorities, and those who work with young people -- found Jeantel to be a normal girl in abnormal circumstances. A single friend of mine in her 30s watching the trial in Washington, D.C., said to me: ""Imagine if you had to get on the witness stand and talk about how the boy you had a crush on was shot and killed right after you got off the phone with him. You'd be upset and nervous, too."" If you work with teenagers or are raising them, you might have found Jeantel more sympathetic than abrasive. If you don't watch much news, maybe you chuckled and identified with the high school senior when she assumed all criminal investigations looked like ""The First 48"" on A&E. What some people viewed as sketchy behavior, others saw as authenticity. Ultimately, after a cross-examination that was sometimes tense, sometimes hostile, and definitely riveting, we are left to determine whether Jeantel swayed the case for the prosecution or for the defense. That depends less on what came out of her mouth than on how the jury saw her before she opened it. If they saw a 19-year-old woman who was hostile, irritable, and a walking-talking racial stereotype, it probably hurt the prosecution and painted a poor picture of Martin. If they saw a senior in high school who was nervous, sincere, and obviously still in mourning, it likely hurt the defense's narrative. More than any other witness so far, I think the public will be split on Jeantel. No one is going to be swayed from their first impression no matter what she does, and that's never a good thing, no matter what side of this case you're arguing.","Reaction to Zimmerman trial witness Rachel Jeantel is mixed .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Security experts are questioning information released by the Pentagon last week, saying 61 former detainees from its detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, may have returned to terrorist activities. President Obama has signed an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility. The report, released days before President Obama took office, says 18 former detainees are confirmed to have participated in attacks, and 43 are suspected to have been involved in attacks. That figure would be about 11 percent of the roughly 520 prisoners who have been released from the Guantanamo facility, which Obama on Thursday ordered be shut down. On Friday, a Pentagon spokesman defended the integrity of the report but would not directly answer questions about where the figures come from. ""We don't make these figures up. They're not done willy-nilly,"" spokesman Geoff Morrell said. Pentagon officials have said they would not discuss how the statistics were derived because of security concerns that such information could give clues to how U.S. intelligence officers collect their data. ""It is painstakingly done by the Defense Intelligence Agency, and they go over this with great care,"" Morrell said. He said evidence of someone being ""confirmed"" to have returned to terrorism could include fingerprints, a conclusive photograph or ""well-corroborated intelligence reporting."" CNN has learned that some former Guantanamo detainees have returned to the fight. An al Qaeda video viewed by CNN's Nic Robertson showed militants labeled with their former prisoner numbers. Saeed Shihri, Prisoner No. 372, is believed to have been responsible for an attack on the U.S. embassy in Yemen that killed nearly a dozen people in September, barely a year after he was released from Guantanamo. A U.S. counter-terrorism expert said Shihri is one of al Qaeda's top leaders in Yemen.  Watch former Gitmo detainee train with al Qaeda » . Others have included Abdullah Mahsud, who blew himself up to avoid capture by Pakistani forces in July 2007, and Ruslan Anatolivich Odizhev, who was transferred to Russia in March 2004 and killed in a June 2007 gunbattle with Russian security forces. Peter Bergen, a national security expert and CNN analyst, notes that of the 18 people the Pentagon says are confirmed to have engaged in terrorism, only a handful of names have been released. If one accepts that all 18 on the ""confirmed"" list have returned to the battlefield, that would be 4 percent of the detainees who have been released, Bergen said. Bergen also noted Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics data that show the recidivism rate for U.S. state prisoners who have been released is more than 65 percent. Those same numbers show that about half of the released prisoners are returned to prison. Bergen said that some of the prisoners at Guantanamo may not have been terrorists at all but were singled out by vengeful villagers who told U.S. authorities they were al Qaeda. ""We know that a lot of people who were in Guantanamo don't qualify as being the 'worst of the worst,'"" he said, quoting former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's assessment. Bergen said some of those ""suspected"" to have returned to terrorism are so categorized because they publicly made anti-American statements, ""something that's not surprising if you've been locked up in a U.S. prison camp for several years."" In a briefing Thursday, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates -- an advocate for closing Guantanamo while serving under President Bush and, now, under President Obama -- seemed to downplay the number of former detainees who have returned to fighting. ""It's not as big a number if you're talking about 700 or a thousand or however many have been through Guantanamo,"" he said. As the Pentagon begins the work of closing the facility and finding places to send, or release, detainees there, Gates stressed that security will remain his top concern. ""Clearly, the challenge that faces us, and that I've acknowledged before, is figuring out how do we close Guantanamo and, at the same time, safeguard the security of the American people,"" he said. ""That's the challenge that we will continue to face."" CNN's Mike Mount at the Pentagon and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Questions arise over report 61 Gitmo detainees have returned to terrorist activities .

"Almost three years has elapsed since the ousting of the dictator Ben Ali from Tunisia, which triggered the commonly -- and wrongly -- labeled Arab Spring. At that time Tunisians, full of high hopes and incited by the degradation of their living conditions, took to the streets and demonstrated peacefully for real change in their country. For us, it wasn't an Arab Spring but a Dignity Revolution. Tunisians' demands were summarized in the most chanted slogan of that time: ""Employment, freedom and dignity."" But how have things changed since then? Are there real efforts to bring democracy? Are we really experiencing a democratic transition? After the departure of Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, the few months of revolutionary euphoria, and the succession of two transitional governments, we finally had, on October the 23, 2011, what was expected to be the first fair and transparent elections of a Constituent Assembly. The elections were meant to choose representatives with a duty to draft a new Constitution within a year. The Islamists, the Ennahdha Party, won about 40% of the seats in the Constituent Assembly. Two political parties joined the once outlawed Islamist group and formed the ruling Troika. More than two years later, Tunisia does not have its new Constitution. The majority of Tunisians seem unhappy with the performance of the ruling parties. And while Tunisia has avoided the bloodshed afflicting much of the Arab region, plans to revitalize the country have stalled. Let's be methodical and go back to the slogan of the dignity revolution: ""Employment, freedom and national dignity."" Economic misery, social frustration and political yearning were the main elements that led to the eruption of revolts. The economic despair was central to the revolution, but today Tunisia is failing to deliver the jobs and opportunities people have been longing for. No one can deny that the economic situation in Tunisia is catastrophic. Unemployment is on rise and the number of job opportunities are in decline. Insecurity is a major reason for this. The atmosphere of uncertainty created by the ongoing arguments between the ruling Islamists and the secular opposition over the formation of a caretaker cabinet is tormenting investors, tourists and international lenders. The assassination of two opposition leaders, explosion of several mines, killings of several soldiers and policemen in Mount Chaambi and suicide attack at a beach resort has made the situation worse. The confusion is destabilizing the country, and has had a huge impact on the economy. When we speak of freedom, human rights and dignity, the situation is no better. Individual freedoms and human rights are frequently violated. Jabeur Majeri, the first Tunisian imprisoned for his opinion after Ben Ali was ousted, would be the best example. Jabeur received a seven and a half year jail sentence for expressing his views on Facebook. His case is not unique; several journalists, bloggers, artists have been arrested and intimidated for their opinions. Leaks about mistreatments, torture and sometimes death under torture are not rare. Human right defenders point to several cases of suspected deaths under torture. In today's Tunisia you can be hassled, harassed, assaulted and even threatened of death if you dare to express your opinion as to the progressive Islamization of the country. If you are a woman you can face all this just for wearing ""inappropriate"" clothes or for going out at night. Violent police attacks on peaceful demonstrations have been recorded many times, like was the case on April 9, 2012, when many people were beaten and severely injured for celebrating the memory of the martyrs. As an activist I have certainly experienced intimidation under the regime of Ben Ali. But I have never received death threats and I didn't have to be under the close protection of the police as it is the case today. All I am doing is expressing myself as I used to do. I am trying to comment on the situation as I see it and I am attempting to give voice to those who don't have one, so I can expose their problems and sufferings. So can we continue to talk about dignity when people are jobless and human rights are violated? Can we talk about dignity when our mouths are muzzled? After months of wrangling over Tunisia's future following the assassinations, within six months, of Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi --  the country's two dissident leaders -- political parties in Tunisia finally chose the country's new leader. Mehdi Jomaa is now acting Prime Minister of the country, and is due to be officially appointed in January. He has been tasked with leading the country out of its political impasse. But will this drive the country out of the crisis? I feel our revolution has been confiscated and our dreams stolen. Despite this I remain hopeful for my country. Tunisians, especially the young, civil society and women are resisting attempts to steal the Dignity Revolution dreams and derail it from its real objectives and goals . There have been several attempts to attack both human rights and women's rights as the Constitution has been drafted. But this has been noticed by civil society watchdogs, who will act when they need to. Attempts to exclude young people from taking decisions and to muzzle the mouths of Tunisians are resisted.

"It's the business buzzword that's helping to change the global economy: Start-up. But in Berlin, the start-up world is still shaping up. Simon Schaefer is the founder of Factory, a 16,000-square-meter co-working space in Berlin designed to cultivate entrepreneurship. Factory allows small start-ups to work on the same campus as more established tech companies, providing a ""playground for entrepreneurs and innovators."" CNN spoke with Schaefer to find out how Factory is facilitating start-ups and the burgeoning Berlin tech scene. CNN: How many start-ups are currently working at Factory? Simon Schaefer: Right now we have about 25 companies here on the premises. The big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we're stage agnostic so we have later-stage companies or established companies like Mozilla, local heroes like Soundcloud or Wunderkinder, which are role models for younger founders to look up to. CNN: How does Berlin's start-up environment compare to the likes of Silicon Valley? SS: If you compare Berlin to other ecosystems, it's very early stage.  And it needs time the most, and collective know-how.  And getting companies from different stages and having them work with each other is much, much easier with proximity and bringing people together in one place. CNN: What advice do you have for others who are starting a business? SS: I think what you should do is look at the individual stages of development of the company.  If you're an angel or seed-stage, it's rather simple. You get feedback on your product and you get the chance to test your ideas with your peers. If you're in a later stage company, I think you quickly realize that growth changes you. And so I think not only do the founders of those companies invest and engage with early-stage companies, but also they still have to touch base with what they were like a few years ago.  I think it's always important to have that visually in front of you, to be aware of what it really means to be a small, flexible team. CNN: Why did you choose to invest in start-ups? SS: Quite frankly [Factory is] a €22 million ($28 million) investment and it's entirely brought together by five individuals. If you look at real estate as a business, start-ups are probably your worst clients. Because if it works really well, they outgrow the space quickly. And if it doesn't work at all, you'll hear from them when there's a lot of rent left to be paid. So it was very difficult to create a concept around the dynamism of start-up culture. And I think we've succeeded by being very flexible and having short-term and long-term spaces for their individual stages. There's a lot of interesting momentum in Berlin and we're trying to capture that in one place. So for anyone who wants to be part of that movement, it would make sense to be here.","Berlin is vying with London to be capital of Europe's start-up scene .

"Rugby Union formally began in Australia with the formation of the first clubs, the oldest of which is the Sydney University Club, formed in 1864. By 1874 there were enough clubs to form a Sydney Metropolitan competition, and in that year the Southern Rugby Union was established. 1899 Australian Team . In 1892 the Southern Rugby Union of New South Wales and the Northern Rugby Union of Queensland (formed in 1883) became New South Wales and Queensland Rugby Unions, respectively. Until 1947, New South Wales, as the senior union, was responsible for the administration of all incoming and outgoing tours and for representing Australia on the International Rugby Board. However, in that year the various State Unions agreed that the future of Rugby Union in Australia would be better served by forming one administrative body. Added impetus came in 1948 when the International Board invited Australia specifically (rather than a New South Wales representative), to take a seat on the Board. The inaugural meeting of the Australian Rugby Football Union was held on November 25, 1949, with 11 delegates from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. Sir Leslie Herron, the President of New South Wales Rugby Union, was a guiding hand in the formation of the Australian Rugby Football Union and overseeing activity through his role as chairman. After a slump in the fortunes of Australian Rugby in the early 1970s, an in-depth survey of the past, present and future Rugby Union was carried out, resulting in a re-appraisal of coaching Rugby World Cup techniques and a restructuring of the administration.

"British politicians and EU officials expressed concern on Thursday after it emerged that a seven-year-old article criticising a former Merrill Lynch chief executive was set to be removed from Google's search results. The action, which comes as the internet search company responds to the EU ruling on the ""right to be forgotten"" by removing articles from its European search rankings, led to accusations of censorship and over-reach. Titled ""Merrill's mess"", the 2007 blog post by Robert Peston, now the BBC's economics editor, describes how Stan O'Neal left the US investment bank after it suffered huge losses on risky investments. In a blog post on Wednesday Mr Peston said the search company had in effect removed his article from the public record, ""given that Google is the route to information and stories for most people"". He had earlier received a ""notice of removal"" from the search company, informing him that his article would no longer appear in the results of some searches. In May, the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court, ruled that individuals had the right to request the removal of search results linking to ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"" personal data -- even if the information had been published legally. Google -- which opposed the court decision -- responded by introducing an online form giving visitors to its European sites a formal route to make removal requests. In the first four days after uploading the form, Google received more than 41,000 requests. Two senior EU officials said Google's removal of the BBC article was a misinterpretation of the ECJ's ruling. One, who did not want to be named, said: ""The ruling and the European Commission have made it clear that the right to be forgotten should not be applied for journalistic work."" Earlier this year Viviane Reding, who stepped down this week from being the EU's justice commissioner to become a member of the European Parliament, said the court had ""made clear that journalistic work must not be touched; it is to be protected"". However, the ECJ's ruling was a little more intricate. The court said the right to privacy could be waived if ""justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of its inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question"". But it also added that in some cases the public interest argument was valid only for the search engine of a news site, not for that of a general search engine such as Google. Legal experts said the decision to remove Mr Peston's article highlighted the complexity of interpreting the new EU law and the difficulty in applying it to Google, which now had to act as a de facto freedom of expression regulator. ""There are some cases that are clear-cut but the majority of cases will be in a grey area like this one,"" said Eduardo Ustaran, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells in London. ""Now it's up to Google to understand whether an article is in the public interest or not. That's tough for a company."" Dominic Raab, a British Conservative MP, said: ""This draconian European court ruling risks turning internet search engines from being the great 21st-century emancipators of millions of ordinary people into arbitrary censors -- and a refuge for scoundrels and crooks looking to airbrush away their own unsavoury history."" Tracey Crouch, a Conservative MP on the culture select committee, said: ""If critical articles are removed from Google searches at the request of persons named or unnamed, it could pose serious questions for lawmakers, the media and society."" Ben Bradshaw, a former Labour culture secretary, added that the company appeared to be over-interpreting the court ruling. ""Mr Peston is right to say the information he published is still relevant,"" he said. ""I can't see why Google would do this. It is either a mistake or could be an attempt by them [Google] to whip up a storm of indignation against the regulatory authorities in an attempt to influence the bigger battles to come."" A link to Wednesday's article posted to the BBC journalist's Twitter feed has been retweeted more than 600 times. Mr Peston conceded that he could simply be ""the victim of teething problems"" as the search company begins to implement the rules. He added, however: ""There is an argument that in removing the blog, Google is confirming the fears of many in the industry that the 'right to be forgotten' will be abused to curb freedom of expression and to suppress legitimate journalism that is in the public interest."" The BBC has a right to appeal against Google's move and seek the view of the UK's data protection regulator, which has the right to overturn the search engine's decision. It is not clear who requested the removal of the article from Google's search rankings. Mr O'Neal was the only individual named in the 2007 article, but Mr Peston pointed out in an update to his Wednesday night blog post that the request could have come from any of the readers who commented beneath the original article, or anyone named in those comments. The blog post continued to appear under certain searches on Google's UK site on Thursday. Google does not plan to remove links to personal information from the US version of its search engine, meaning Europeans can visit Google.com to search for information removed from their local version.

"Throngs of demonstrators filled Barcelona's streets Tuesday in a regional independence protest fueled by Spain's economic crisis. September 11 is known as Catalonia's national day, and for years there have been demonstrations pushing for independence in the northeastern region. But Tuesday's turnout was larger than expected, Spanish newspapers reported. Hours before, Artur Mas, the president of Catalonia's regional government, attended official ceremonies commemorating the day. Later, he issued a warning: if Spain's central government in Madrid doesn't give the region more control over its tax dollars, independence could be an option. ""If we do not reach a financial agreement with the central government, the path to freedom for Catalonia is open,"" he said. Many Catalans complain that Catalonia provides many riches and taxes to the rest of Spain -- more than they owe. Changing this structure and creating a new ""fiscal pact"" is a primary goal of Mas' government. ""If you compare the money we send to Madrid every year and the money we get back from Madrid, there is a difference -- a near difference of $20 billion,"" Mas told CNN in June. In Madrid, Spanish President Mariano Rajoy has said that what the country needs aren't independence protests, but unity and strength to come out of the economic crisis.

"Washington (CNN)Top congressional Republican leaders quickly criticized the U.S.-China climate change pact to cut carbon emissions that President Barack Obama announced while traveling in Asia. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is expected to chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, slammed the agreement in statements released shortly after the deal was announced Wednesday. ""Our economy can't take the President's ideological War on Coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners,"" McConnell, who hails from the coal state of Kentucky, said. ""This unrealistic plan, that the President would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs."" President Barack Obama announced Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping that the U.S. will cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28% by 2025 while China committed to creating more energy from zero-emission sources and begin reducing its emissions footprint by 2030. Boehner called the deal another example of Obama's ""job-crushing policies."" ""And it is the latest example of the president's crusade against affordable, reliable energy that is already hurting jobs and squeezing middle-class families,"" Boehner said in a statement Wednesday. Inhofe criticized the deal as unfair and knocked the Chinese pledge to produce 20% of its energy from zero-emission sources as ""hollow and not believeable."" ""The United States will be required to more steeply reduce our carbon emissions while China won't have to reduce anything,"" Inhofe said. China overtook the U.S. within the last decade as the world's top polluter following decades of the U.S. as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. McConnell and Inhofe called attention to the midterm election results, both noting that ""the American people spoke up against"" Obama's policies. The two senators also made a pledge of their own, vowing to rein in regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency, a common target for Republicans. McConnell will take the helm of a freshly won Republican majority in the Senate in January. And while McConnell and Obama have both vowed to try and work together, climate change regulation is likely to remain a contentious point with little common ground between Obama and GOP leaders. The agreement does not require congressional ratification, but a senior Obama administration official said ""leading climate deniers"" in the GOP could try and stop the initiative through legislation. ""Congress may try to stop us, but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have,"" the official said. The plan will also offer incentives in the United States to build up solar and wind power. ""Consumers and businesses will save literally billions of dollars,"" a senior administration official said.

"Real Madrid and Barcelona both comfortably won on Saturday, but for once Spain's two most dominant football clubs were overshadowed by a third-tier team which has been saved from extinction after receiving a huge injection of cash from the world's richest man, Carlos Slim. Just over a decade ago Real Oviedo played in La Liga alongside Real and Barca, but mismanagement from the club's directors took the Asturian team to the brink of bankruptcy in recent years. Needing to raise €1.9 million ($2.4 million) by November 17 or go bust, Oviedo's current board announced a share issue earlier this month to attract investment. Remarkably the scheme took off as fans from all over the world bought the €11 ($13) shares after Oviedo's precarious position was highlighted on the social media website Twitter thanks to the efforts of Spanish football expert and long-time Oviedo supporter Sid Lowe. Over the past two weeks  those fans have bought more than $1.9 million in new shares in the club, and Slim was so impressed  -- he described the gesture as ""extraordinary"" -- that the Mexican tycoon has now pumped in a further $2.5 million to become Oviedo's majority shareholder. ""This challenge and ambition is strictly a sports investment and one that looks to benefit the club and its fans,'' said an Oviedo statement regarding Slim's intervention. ""(The investment) will try to support Oviedo's players so they can reach their goals and the club can reach the division that corresponds to its history and values.'' In September Slim bought 30% stakes in two Mexican football teams, Pachuca and Leon, and he plans to use Oviedo ""to create synergies and exchanges between Spanish, Mexican and Latin American football.'' According to Forbes magazine, Slim is the world's richest person with a net worth of $69 billion, having made his fortune in the telecommunications industry. His widespread interests include providing financial backing for Mexican Formula One driver Sergio Perez. ""Naturally, I have reservations, doubts & concerns,"" tweeted Lowe on Saturday. ""But with c. €2m of shares bought by 13,000+ ppl round world & Slim buying €2m Oviedo safe."" ""€1.93m raised by small shareholders alone,"" added Lowe. ""They're the real heroes."" Meanwhile, La Liga leaders Barcelona beat Real Zaragoza 3-1 to move six points clear of Atletico Madrid, who travel to Granada on Sunday. Lionel Messi scored two more goals to move to 78 for this calendar year, putting the Argentina star seven short of Gerd Muller's all-time record. Champions Real Madrid trounced Athletic Bilbao 5-1 to stay third, six points behind their arch-rivals. Cristiano Ronaldo played despite the eye injury he suffered last weekend, but this time the Portugal star was unable to add to his scoring tally as the spoils were shared by Karim Benzema, Sergio Ramos, Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira after an early own-goal by Jon Aurtenetxe. In Italy, leaders Juventus were held to a 0-0 draw by fifth-placed Lazio. Second-placed Inter Milan can close to within two points of the Serie A champions by beating Cagliari on Sunday. Napoli joined Inter on 27 points after being held 2-2 by AC Milan, who came from two goals down as young striker Stephan El Shaarawy netted twice. In Germany, Bayern Munich moved eight points clear despite being held 1-1 away to struggling Bavarian rivals Nuremberg. Second-placed Schalke failed to take advantage, losing 2-0 at Bayer Leverkusen. Eintracht Frankfurt stayed third after a 4-2 win at home to Augsburg, a point above champions Borussia Dortmund -- who beat Greuther Furth 3-1.","Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim invests $2.5 million in struggling Spanish club .

"(CNN)  -- Soupy Sales, a comedian from the golden era of television, died Thursday. He was 83. Soupy Sales entertained generations of Americans with his off-the-cuff, wacky antics. He was 83. The funny man seen many times on popular game shows died at a New York hospice, said Paul Dver, Sales' longtime friend and manager. ""We have lost a comedy American icon,"" Dver said. ""I feel the personal loss, and I also feel the magic that he had around him being gone. That's a much more severe loss than a loss of a friend."" Sales was known for his long-running children's show ""Lunch With Soupy Sales,"" which started in 1953 and began his trademark slapstick pie-throwing antics. The comedy show featured skits that culminated in Sales getting walloped with pies in the face. What are your memories of Sales? ""Soupy was the last of the great TV comics when you talk about Ernie Kovacs, Red Skelton, right down to Howdy Doody,"" Dver said. ""But it was bigger than that, because he used a children's format aimed at the kids and then he would forget he was doing a kids' show and do a wild, unrehearsed, wacky improv for a half-hour every day for 15 years."" He could also inflame the authorities. One New Year's Day, upset at being asked to work, he asked his youthful audience to send him those ""green pieces of paper"" from their parents' wallets. Though he didn't receive much -- he told The New York Times he received only a few dollars -- he was suspended for a week for the prank. Later in his career, he was a regular on TV game shows, such as ""Hollywood Squares,"" ""To Tell the Truth"" and ""What's My Line?"" Sales recently fell backstage at a local Emmy awards show in New York and developed serious ailments after that, Dver said.

"Under unprecedented scrutiny over its human rights record, North Korean officials met with a UN human rights investigator this week for the first time in 10 years. Marzuki Darusman, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea, said he met ""unexpectedly"" with the delegation for about an hour on Monday. North Korean officials proposed the possibility of arranging a visit by human rights officials to the country. He said they also raised concerns about the UN resolution on possible consequences against North Korea. Darusman said the timing of the sudden meeting with the officials was ""notable."" Human rights pressure . Murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence, mass starvation -- North Korea's leaders have been accused of employing all sorts of abuses to prop up the state and exercise control over its citizens. Citing such violations, North Korea's human rights situation should be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) along with the consideration of further sanctions, according to a report Darusman submitted to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. The EU and Japan have authored a draft resolution calling for similar penalties. Darusman said the UN has to come up with a way to act on the North Korea human rights violations in a coordinated way. His comments come at a time when North Korea has gone on a publicity blitz. Its diplomats have fanned the globe in an attempt to soften its image, with its officials taking questions from journalists, speaking in public and offering talks with South Korea, Japan and the European Union. In what was viewed as a gesture of goodwill, North Korea even released detained American, Jeffrey Fowle last week. But that didn't appear to sway Darusman. ""I welcome these signs of increased engagement by the DPRK with the Human Rights Council and international community, and I hope they will bear fruit,"" Darusman said. ""But these must be premised on a more fundamental acknowledgement of the scale of the problems and must not divert from efforts to ensure the accountability of those responsible."" Recent pressures . North Korea has made the following overtures this month: . -- It is holding talks with Japan's delegates in Pyongyang regarding Japanese citizens abducted decades ago. Earlier this year, Japan eased several of its sanctions in exchange for information about Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea during the Cold War. That report has yet to be issued. -- North Korea had scheduled talks with South Korea for Thursday, but that appears to have been canceled. Pyongyang officials sent a notice saying that the South wasn't creating conditions for a better relationship. The Unification Ministry in South Korea said the meeting would be difficult to hold at this point. -- North Korea has also suggested that it would be open to restarting nuclear talks, which would include the United States. It released U.S. citizen, Fowle from detention, although two others remain in North Korea. -- It has extended offers to talk about its human rights to the EU. North Korea's stance . North Korean officials, like Jang Il Hun, its ambassador to the U.N. have defended the country's human rights. The international community is ""making very great fuss about human rights violations"" and discussions persist about ""referral of the international criminal justice mechanism and bringing those responsible at the highest level of the state to justice,"" he said in a rare public address last week in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations . This year, a scathing U.N. Commission of Inquiry report was published, cataloging North Korea's abuses that the authors said amounted to crimes against humanity. It recommended prosecuting North Korea's leaders at the ICC for such crimes including torture, extensive political prison camps and other abuses. 'Abundant evidence' of crimes against humanity . ""We totally and categorically reject the contents of the report. None of such violations exist in my country, and in no way can they exist, also,"" Jang said. In order to charge North Korean leaders, the move would have to be approved by the U.N. Security Council. If the matter escalates to that level, statements by Chinese officials indicate that China, a permanent member of the Security Council, is likely to veto the referral. Underlying tensions . Critics say North Korea's overtures are meant to deflect a coordinated international effort against the country. ""They see a steady drumbeat of anger in the international community at North Korea's human rights abuses and they're worried it may actually come to fruition in terms of something quite substantial,"" said Victor Cha, a former director for Asian Affairs at the White House under former President George W. Bush. The United States military has also viewed North Korean actions with skepticism. ""They've reached out to other countries, that has been a bit of a change,"" said General Curits Scaparrotti, combined forces commander of U.S. forces in South Korea. ""Right underneath that, at the same time, they continue to pace their development of missile systems, their nuclear systems, other asymmetric means and working hard at that.""

"Kayla Michelle Finley may be wishing that services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime had been around a little earlier. The South Carolina woman spent a night in jail last week for failing to return a video she rented -- in 2005. It was a VHS tape. Of a Jennifer Lopez movie. Finley, 27, was arrested Thursday in Pickens County, South Carolina, on a misdemeanor charge of failure to return the video, according to CNN affiliate WYFF-TV. The movie, ""Monster-In-Law,"" starring Lopez and Jane Fonda as a feuding potential daughter- and mother-in-law, was rented from a video store, Dalton Videos, that is now out of business. The WYFF report says Finley was at the county sheriff's office on another matter when an active warrant for her arrest was discovered. Chief Deputy Creed Hashe told the station that the store's owner had asked a Pickens County judge for the warrant years ago when Finley didn't return her video. Hashe said Finley had been sent several certified letters asking her to turn herself in. Finley spent the night in jail because her bond hearing couldn't be held until Friday morning. A judge released her on $2,000 bond. Efforts to reach out to Finley via social media were unsuccessful early Monday. But a woman identifying herself as Finley, and whose profile picture appeared similar to Finley's mug shot, took to Fox Carolina News Facebook page on Saturday to defend herself. She said that after renting the movie she had to move out of state because of her husband's job and that she simply forgot about it. ""I'm no criminal, but Pickens County Sheriff's office sure made me feel like I was,"" she wrote. She said she never received any letters from the sheriff's office, while striking back at people who had made negative comments on the Fox post. ""If I had, it would have been taken care of immediately,"" she wrote. ""Some of you need to quit (judging) like you are. This is a bogus charge and everyone knows it."" For Finley, it's no laughing matter. But that didn't stop folks online from commenting on the ridiculousness of it all. ""Oh god, I'm so embarrassed,"" wrote Twitter user Alec MacKinnon. ""Now everyone is going to know I rented 'Monster In Law.' "" ""They should sentence her to time already served,"" wrote one CNN commenter. ""She'll never get the 2 hours she spent watching that movie back."" Others were taking shots at what they felt was an overreaction by law enforcement. ""Wait till they find out that she forgot to REWIND the tape!!!"" annother commenter wrote. The Pickens County Sheriff's Office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.","A South Carolina woman was jailed overnight last week for not returning a 2005 video rental .

""Tonight we celebrate all the great television shows we know and love as well as all the movies that North Korea was okay with,"" Fey said. There was a moment of uncomfortable tittering in the audience when Poehler took on the controversy of allegations that Bill Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted women. ""In 'Into the Woods' Cinderella runs from her prince, Rapunzel is thrown from a tower for her prince, and Sleeping Beauty just thought she was getting coffee with Bill Cosby,"" Poehler said. There was also a running joke with actress Margaret Cho, playing a North Korean general who was not happy with the way the awards show was progressing. ""This is not a show, you no have thousand baby playing guitar at the same time,"" Cho said in character. ""You no have people holding up many cartoon to make one big picture. You no have Dennis Rodman. No basketball at all."" Fey earlier told E! that she and her bestie Poehler were going to take advantage of being in the final year of their three-year Globes contract to push the envelope with their humor. ""Listen, it's our last time!"" she said.  ""What are they going to do, fire us?! Who cares!"" Theo Kingma, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, received a standing ovation when he referenced the attacks in Paris. ""We will stand against anyone who would repress free speech anywhere from North Korea to Paris,"" he said. The 72nd Golden Globes is produced by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and is viewed by many in Hollywood as a good predictor for the Oscars. Music legend Prince surprised the crowd when he showed up to present the award for best original song in a motion picture. The award went to rapper/actor Common and musician John Legend for their song ""Glory"" from the film ""Selma."" Common said that in working on the project he ""got to know the people of the civil rights movement"" and in doing so realized that he was ""the hopeful black woman who was denied her right to vote."" ""I am the caring white supporter killed on the front lines of freedom,"" he said. ""I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand but, instead, was given a bullet.

"Once one of Africa's most beautiful destinations, Zimbabwe has been off the mainstream tourism radar for years. Robert Mugabe's three decades of rule, while ostensibly democratic, have been widely criticized by locals as a dictatorship. Tourism collapsed when white farmers were driven from their land, and famine and hyperinflation ensued. Since adopting the U.S. dollar as its currency in 2009, economic healing has slowly begun, with foreign investment driving much of the recovery. Now, the country's stunning natural and cultural attractions are recapturing the attention of both foreign travelers and investors keen to capitalize on that interest. Tourist arrivals increasing . The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority's latest Tourism Trends and Statistics Report claims visitor numbers increased 17% to 400,000 visitors in the first quarter of 2013 compared with 2012. Nearly half come from South Africa. Euromonitor International predicts steady growth in several tourism areas (accommodation, transport, attractions) for the next five years. Victoria Falls, the top tourist draw, has always brought visitors, even in the dark years. Hotel occupancy isn't at capacity, to be sure. But hotels, airports and other logistics all run relatively smoothly. Five-star properties such as the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge have been able to maintain a luxurious standard. Work began earlier this year on a massive upgrade of the Victoria Falls airport, which currently handles commercial flights from Harare and Johannesburg. The overhaul, reportedly costing $150 million, is financed by a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, and will include a new runway, control tower and terminal building. A number of international carriers had stopped service into the country. Now Emirates and KLM are offering service to Harare again. Air Zimbabwe resumed its service to Johannesburg in August. New hotels, malls . Luxury projects in the capital include a proposed $70 million Mall of Zimbabwe. Hilton is said to be considering a five-star hotel in Harare. ""At this time we have no signed projects to announce in Zimbabwe, but we think there is great potential in the market,"" says Heather Shaw, a spokesperson for Hilton. ""We are exploring opportunities that we believe would create value for us and our partners."" Tara Walraven, an Africa Safari Specialist at Audley Travel, says the company is fielding numerous queries from people who want a dedicated trip from the UK to Zimbabwe, or who want to add a few nights to a Botswana safari. ""It's a lovely country, people are so friendly, so excited to have people visit them,"" says Walraven, who grew up in Zimbabwe and visits her family there. ""We don't have any concern about people traveling to Zimbabwe at the moment. We can't send people to a country that isn't safe."" Politics and challenges . In March, the European Union dropped most of its sanctions against Zimbabwe following the country's adoption of a new constitution. However, recent election results proclaiming another Mugabe win have widely been dismissed by Western observers as fraudulent. The Times of London reports that the UK will ""shun"" Zimbabwe by not sending any delegates to the UN World Tourism Organization's meeting later this month, which will be held jointly in Victoria Falls and Livingston, Zambia. Marcelo Risi of the UNWTO says the General Assembly selected the host countries nearly two years ago and that the decision shouldn't be seen as politically motivated. The meeting is expected to draw a thousand or so delegates and their teams from overseas. In anticipation of the UNWTO meeting, border posts at Victoria Falls and Katima Mulilo were recently computerized, to ease passage between the countries. The country still needs to modernize its immigration process, as highlighted in a recent policy brief by the Zimbabwe Economic Policy Analysis and Research Unit, a Harare think tank. Other problems include limited domestic transportation options -- tourists with limited time frequently take light aircraft between destinations -- water and power shortages and retention of quality staff. ""Executive chefs and managerial positions in the hotel industry are occupied by a majority of personnel with limited experience and technical skills,"" compounded by a decline in the quality of recent tourism studies graduates, according to the brief. Not the place for voluntourism . Journalists and humanitarian aid workers, including short-term volunteers, still need to proceed with caution. ""You should be very aware of your surroundings and seriously consider the risks of taking any pictures outside game parks and known tourist areas,"" warns the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs. South African photographer David Southwood recently made his second trip to Zimbabwe, and called it one of the ""most unnerving"" experiences he's ever had. Although he entered on a tourist visa, he was in the country on an assignment that brought him into contact with ""revolutionary and resistance circles."" ""Everybody we spoke to had been pummeled by the regime in some way,"" he reports. ""The paranoia Mugabe has inculcated into the people rubbed off onto me. The ambiance in Zimbabwe for a photographer is not cool."" Still, he adds, ""If you weren't aware of the possibilities of what might happen, it might be one of the most easygoing trips you ever had."" The U.S. government currently has neither an official Travel Warning nor a Travel Alert about its citizens visiting Zimbabwe. If you go . In Zimbabwe, travelers should expect delays. Roadblocks in and out of cities and dropped Internet connections are par for the course. Road travel can be slow. It's best to avoid car trips at night. Upscale tours offer light aircraft to quickly cover the distances between destinations. Credit card facilities and ATMs aren't always available, so you may want to pay for big-ticket items before departure. Bring the cash you'll need in U.S. dollars or South African rand; bring small bills, as change isn't always handy. Destinations . Harare .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- More than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses have been recovered at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, Thai police said Friday. The fetuses were initially discovered earlier in the week, given away by the smell of decay at the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok. Friday's recovery efforts brought the total discovered to 2,002 fetuses, police Col. Metee Rakpan said. ""From the confession of one of the morticians of the temple that we interrogated last night, he told us that they received these fetuses from the same places as the first lot of 348 fetus remains, and they became dry,"" said Col. Sombat Milintachinda, chief of the investigation team. ""We think that they might have arrived here about a year ago."" Authorities had arrested a woman on two charges, Milintachinda said. ""One is to perform illegal abortions and open an unlicensed clinic,"" he said. Two morticians had been charged with hiding bodies and faced about a year in jail if convicted, police added. Temples in Thailand typically have morticians who prepare bodies for cremation. ""From our interrogation of the morticians, they admitted that they have been receiving fetuses for about four years, and they told us that they kept the fetuses until they dried up, so it is easy to burn them,"" Milintachinda said. The fetuses came from illegal abortion clinics, police Lt. Col. Chusak Kumsai said Wednesday.

""She was an outstanding reporter, she went all over the world, she covered a lot of wars,"" Sunday Times Editor John Witherow told reporters after her funeral service. ""She took tremendous risks and what she did she thought was very important."" Security Council addresses Syria crisis . Asked about the challenge of retrieving Colvin's body, Witherow said it took about a week and a great deal of diplomacy.  ""It was incredibly hard getting her body out of Homs because they kept shelling, they wouldn't let any kind of humanitarian aid in there, they wouldn't let ambulances take it out,"" he said. Neil MacFarquhar, a New York Times correspondent who had dinner with Colvin in Beirut the night before she went into Syria, said Colvin felt compelled to report from Homs despite the dangers and the fact that the Syrian government has not allowed foreign journalists to report from there. ""She knew there was a story in Homs, there was a terrible siege going on,"" MacFarquhar said. ""She was determined to get in however she could."" Visuvanathan Rudrakumaran, prime minister of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam, said his people have a deep admiration for the reporting Colvin did during the Sri Lankan civil war. ""We really lost a friend,"" he said. Colvin lost an eye in 2001 during a grenade attack in Sri Lanka. ""We consider that a symbol of her devotion to her work and her passion for oppressed people,"" Rudrakumaran said. Colvin, a Yale graduate, was killed alongside French journalist Remi Ochlik in the attack. Also attending the funeral were News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, former Assistant Secretary of State James Rubin, and Jeremy Bowen, Middle East editor for BBC news.","Marie Colvin, 56, was killed last month during the shelling of Homs, Syria .

"Every year, more than 200,000 African children are born with sickle-cell anemia -- around 150,000 of those in Nigeria. At the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), rows of young women line up inside the antenatal clinic. Many of them suffer from sickle-cell anemia, the world's most common hereditary blood disorder. They are here to see Dr Bosede Afolabi, a specialist practitioner who has dedicated much of her working life to studying the disease and how it affects pregnant women and their babies. ""We have the highest number of people suffering from sickle-cell disease in the world,"" explains Afolabi, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology who consults twice a week at LUTH. Her mission is to use her knowledge to cut maternal mortality in Nigeria. Around one in four people in the West African country carries the sickle cell gene -- around 40 million people -- and virtually everyone has lost a relative or a close friend to the disease. Read also: Fighting cancer with cell phones . Sickle-cell anemia, which is also referred to as SS disease, is an inherited form of anemia -- a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout the body. Normally, red blood cells are flexible and round, moving easily through blood vessels. In sickle-cell anemia, however, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregularly shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body. Poor blood oxygen levels and blood vessel blockages can result in chronic acute pain syndromes, severe bacterial infections and tissue death, according to the World Health Organization. The sickle-cell trait has a partial protective effect against malaria, and this could explain its high prevalence levels in tropical parts of Africa. For a child to be born with the condition, both parents must carry a sickle-cell gene, which is passed from one generation to the next. ""If somebody with a trait marries another person with a trait, there's an one in four chance that the offspring will have SS,"" explains Afolabi. Read also: 'Women will change the world' At LUTH, she sees patients and passes on her knowledge to duty registrars as well as conducting key research on a disease that affects both women and children before, during and after birth. ""Very few people are doing research in pregnancy in SS women,"" says Afolabi. ""What I'm doing is adding to the body of knowledge that exists and putting on some more, especially since physiological research in pregnancy is not very common. ""It's strange because even ... in the States you do have quite a number of African-Americans that get pregnant with sickle-cell, but the research even from there is not that much at all in pregnancies."" Afolabi says that life expectancy for people with sickle-cell disease is still fairly low -- around late 40s or early 50s. But she is quick to point out that many advances have been made in recent decades. ""Things have changed since the 1940s,"" she says. ""About 40, 50 years ago it wasn't even getting close [to their 50s], so a lot of people weren't even getting pregnant ... because they couldn't live long enough to get pregnant -- a lot of them died in childhood."" Afolabi studied at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Ife before moving to the UK to further her knowledge and gain work experience. She could have stayed in Europe to carve out a successful career but Afolabi decided to go back to Nigeria and help improve things in her home country. ""I just had to come back because I felt that this is where I'm needed, this is where I can make a difference,"" she says.  ""I really love what I do. It can be frustrating because sometimes we have electricity problems ... but the fact that we save so many lives ... because of the work we do, I think that's the most fulfilling thing for a doctor."" Read also: Off-road bikers race to save lives in rural Africa . Afolabi says it can be tough to convince women of the importance of giving birth in a professional healthcare environment. ""We know now that one of the ways we can reduce maternal mortality effectively is by having women deliver in healthcare institutions or at least with skilled healthcare,"" she says. Afolabi adds that she's driven by her passion to make pregnancy safer and reduce the stress that women go through while pregnant. ""I would really love the incidents of maternal mortality in my country to be so much more reduced than it is now,"" she says. ""Because of my work with women with sickle-cell and pregnancy, I would like to get to a stage where, not only would it be that the mortality in pregnancy is zero ... I'd also like to try to find out how to improve the perinatal health as well, the health of their babies so that they would have larger babies and not have so much of mortality,"" she adds. ""That is a tough call ... to change that around is a feat but I plan to continue to work on it for as long as I can.""","Dr Bosede Afolabi is a Nigerian helping pregnant women with sickle-cell anemia .

"A year ago, a fisherman Efren Forones came back from fishing trips with up to three and half tons of fish. In return he was able to buy 15 to 20 kilos of rice for his family every month and was planning to send at least one of his six children to college. Not any more. He now returns with just 400 kilos of catch at best, meaning he can only afford one to two kilos of rice a month, while school for his children is an expensive luxury and out of the question. The reason? He says he can longer fish in the fertile waters around Scarborough Shoal. A cluster of uninhabitable sand banks and small rocks set in a shallow azure water lagoon about 130 miles (200 km) west from the Philippine island of Luzon, Scarborough Shoal is one of a number of territories at the center of an international dispute in the South China Sea. Both the Philippines and China lay claim to it. Tense standoff . The long-term tensions between the two nations escalated last April during a one-month stand off between the two nations, after Manila accused Chinese boats of fishing illegally in the area. When a Philippines navy vessel inspected the boats it found ""large amounts of illegally collected corals, giant clams and live sharks"" inside one of the boats, according to the Philippine government. Manila then reported that two Chinese surveillance ships had taken up position at the mouth of the lagoon, blocking the way to the fishing boats and ""preventing the arrest"" of the fishermen. The vessels stretched a cable across the mouth of the lagoon, which also prevented Filipino fishermen from going there, according to the Philippines coast guard. Earlier this year, the Philippine government took its feud with China to a United Nations tribunal, a move that Beijing has rejected. In an article on state-run CCTV last month, China pointed to a code of conduct it signed in 2002, known as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, with fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It said the declaration expected that relevant disputes be solved through friendly talks and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned. That brings little comfort to the struggling fishermen in communities in west Luzon, the nearest region to Scarborough Shoal -- also known as Panatag Shoal here or Huangyan Island to the Chinese. One of them is Masinloc, a municipality of 40,000 people, which relies on the seas for almost 80% of its income, according to the Philippines Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. It says thousands of fishermen have lost their regular jobs as catches decline. Forones is one of them. The 52 year old has been fishing in the waters off Masinloc for 22 years. He lives with his family in a traditional bamboo house mounted on pillars above the sea. His youngest daughter is four years old. Forones does not own a boat but used to be hired as a fisherman and paid a minimum of $85 dollars for a trip. Nobody is hiring now. He has tried to rent boats on his own and fish with his neighbors, but the little catch they bring back barely covers the rental fee and fuel. He says the Shoal is the most important fishing ground in this region. ""They (the Chinese) shoo us away, will not allow Filipinos to come near the area,"" he says. ""They are the only ones that can fish there, not us. We lost Scarborough and it is hard. We earn nothing."" Beijing is unwavering in its claims. As recently as last month, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported that Chinese surveillance vessels were carrying out regular missions in the South China Sea. The Xinhua report cited Liu Cigui, director of the State Oceanic Administration, as saying that China would continue the patrols ""to secure the nation's maritime rights and interests"" in areas it claims as its territorial waters. China's claim on the area dates back to 1279 during the Yuan Dynasty, when Chinese astronomer Guo Shoujing conducted a survey. Then in 1935, China declared sovereignty over 132 islands, reefs and shoals in the South China Sea, with the Scarborough Shoal -- or Huangyan -- included as a part of the Zhongsha Islands, according to Xinhua. However, Forones is in little doubt who the lagoon, which lies within what the Philippines declares as its Exclusive Economic Zone, belongs to. ""Of course it is ours. We own Scarborough,"" he insists. ""But China is trying to get it from us. Our government should fix that. We should seek help from the United States if the Philippine government cannot handle it alone."" Nowhere else to go . Forones and his wife plan to stay in Masinloc, for now. He will try to start diving for shellfish. By selling clams, mussels and oysters, they can make around $5 a day. Enough to buy rice and other basic food to feed the family. ""There is no other place where we can go. I will stay here, get shells from nearby and help my husband to make living,"" Forones' wife, Gemma, says. The situation is similar in Subic, a town 55 miles (88 km) south of Masinloc. It used to host one of the biggest American naval bases outside the United States, before it closed in 1991. Operators of the fishing market on the outskirts of the town of 90,000 say business is down 50% since the fishermen were blocked from fishing where they wanted to at Scarborough. Many fishermen here share a similar story to their counterparts further north. ""When we went there, a Chinese vessel, the Chinese Marine Surveillance blocked our path,"" says Ronnie Drio, 46-year-old father of eight children. ""As we managed to get past through it, it looked like they called another one because a different ship appeared and blocked our way again. ""That's when we got trapped. Then a Chinese man stepped out. He looked like their highest officer. He flashed a sign that we had to leave immediately. We were kicked out like pigs."" A number of fishermen have already left Subic and Masinloc and many more are considering it. One of them, 58-year-old Tolomeo ""Lomi"" Forones, is Efren's cousin. He's been a fisherman for 30 years but now makes a living as a motorbike taxi driver. He makes around $2 on a good day. ""Our income was higher when we used to fish at Scarborough. I even used to save money.  But now we earn just enough for daily consumption and sometimes what we earn is not even enough to provide food."" Dangerous waters . He still does occasional fishing trips but against his wife's wish. Janet Forones wants to leave Masinloc and their low income is not the only reason: ""Who would not get worried when they are out there? What if they get shot?"" She was referring to the presence of the Chinese boats. What puzzles the fishermen here most is the speed the whole situation has changed. Although the Philippine and Chinese governments have disputed each other's claim to the lagoon for many years, they could fish at Scarborough alongside Chinese fishermen up until a few months ago. ""I do not know why they don't like us or why they do not want us within that area. If Americans were still in the region, the Chinese would have never came to Scarborough because they would be scared. If our government allows the U.S. to come back over here, its OK with me,"" she says, referring to Washington's commitment to its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed last year. But the solution to the dispute is as distant as ever. Litigation at the United Nations could last years. Most of the local fishermen do not have so much time. So while the governments squabble, many of these fishermen and their families will have to leave the only life they have known and start from scratch somewhere else.","China, Philippines claim lagoon, some 130 miles (200 km) west of Philippine island of Luzon .

"That 9-year-old Minnesota boy who slipped through security and hopped a flight to Las Vegas is no stranger to child protection investigators, who say he has a history of sneaking into a water park and was recently arrested after allegedly stealing a car, according to an e-mail obtained by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. And it turns out that his mother works at the airport where he began his journey, a source close to the situation said. The boy's father told CNN affiliate WCCO that his son has had issues in the past. ""I don't have an angel, OK. I have a 9-year-old,"" he said. ""To me, he's got a behavioral problem."" The father, who WCCO did not identify, said the family has been unsuccessfully trying to get help for his son for years. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Janine Moore, area director of the Hennepin County Human Services and Public Health Department, wrote in an e-mail to agency administrators and County Board members of the boy's ""pattern of behavior,"" which has included hanging out at a Bloomington, Minnesota, water park and blending in with a large family to slip through without paying. She describes him as a ""challenging"" child, according to the Star Tribune. The newspaper reported that there is an investigation into whether the boy's mother, who works at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, helped him fly to Las Vegas. The newspaper did not report who was conducting that investigation. The boy's father told WCCO that his wife reported their son missing on Thursday morning -- a day after they last saw him, leaving the house to take out the trash. ""We're not bad parents. We didn't think nothin' of it,"" the father said. ""We thought he was at his friend's house."" The father said he never expected his son would take the light rail from their North Minneapolis neighborhood to the airport and sneak onto an airplane. ""I don't understand,"" he said. ""You've got so (many) security checks at these airports. How can you let a 9-year-old sneak past security, get on the plane, without anyone stopping him, questioning him or anything?"" Authorities have been trying to figure out how the child was able to slip past security and airline gate agents and board Delta Flight 1651 without detection. The boy went through security with other passengers, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement Sunday, but officials were still trying to figure out how he did it -- and how he then got on the flight Thursday. Delta reviewing video to determine how boy hopped flight to Vegas . Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for the airport, said that surveillance video shows the boy briefly talking to a Delta gate agent before the flight. A short while later, the video shows that the agent became ""distracted,"" and that's when the boy was able to sneak through and board the plane, he said. Hogan said the crew ""became suspicious of the child's circumstances"" during the flight. Crew members got in touch with authorities in Las Vegas and turned the boy over to Child Protective Services, Hogan said in a statement. The boy, who remained in Nevada, will be returned to Minneapolis because that is ""where issues will be addressed,"" a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN. It was unclear when he would return to Minnesota. The agency did not immediately return a CNN telephone message Tuesday seeking comment on the Star Tribune report. According to the Star Tribune, Moore said child protective workers have investigated the boy's family life four times. ""The reports have been inconsistent and there have been no injuries to the child; however, there is a pattern of behavior,"" the newspaper quoted her as saying in the e-mail. The newspaper said Moore wrote that the boy was arrested two weeks ago after allegedly stealing a car. The e-mail didn't indicate whether the boy was the driver of the car or a passenger, the newspaper reported. The newspaper also said Moore wrote that the boy has alleged that his mother has held a knife to his throat and that she was ""stabbed and died."" ""Typically, staff can tell if a child is lying, but with this child, they are unsure what is going on,"" the newspaper quoted the e-mail as reading. Delta on Monday said it was reviewing surveillance video. Flight crew members alerted authorities to the boy.","Dad of plane stowaway: ""I don't have an angel, OK. I have a 9-year-old""

"(CNN) -- Ask any teen whether he or she suffers from social media anxiety, and the answer will probably be no. That's what happened when six teens and adolescents -- five from New York and one from Los Angeles -- got together recently for a unique weeklong workshop at the offices of SheKnows.com, a leading women's lifestyle media platform. The teens didn't think that Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, their go-to social networks, added much extra anxiety to their lives. But then the conversation turned to the importance of likes and the fear of missing out, also known by the acronym FOMO. Sadie, a 10th-grader in Brooklyn, New York, said she'd never heard the acronym before but is definitely familiar with the feeling. ""You see on, I guess you could say, Facebook or even Snapchat ... you see your friends hanging out with other people, and you're like 'Oh, I'm alone right now,'"" she said. ""And even if there's no way you could get to them even if you wanted to, it still just makes you feel bad or lonely or sad."" The upside of selfies: Social media not all bad for kids . Olivia, 12, said she sometimes feels that way, too. ""If there's an event that maybe I'm not at or my friends are hanging out with each other ... sometimes I kind of feel, I guess, kind of left out."" The quest for the '100 club' The teens and tweens also agreed there is a constant -- and at times anxiety-inducing -- fixation with likes. ""People will be like, 'Oh, are you in the 100 club?' "" Sadie said of getting 100 or more likes for a post. The 15-year-old told the story of a friend who changed her profile picture and didn't get the 200 likes she normally gets on the first night whenever she makes such a change. ""She was freaking out,"" she said. The more likes, the greater the social standing you appear to have, the girls said. ""People feel that when they get a lot of likes. It means that they're pretty and popular, and that makes them feel better,"" Sadie said. Schools step up social media monitoring of students . Said Olivia: ""I really do notice that a lot of people who get tons of likes and have tons of followers on Instagram and Facebook do tend to think that they are really popular and that everyone knows who they are, when ... all their followers haven't even met them before."" Likes translate into validation and attention, said Diana Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. Graber also teaches ""cybercivics"" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California. When she overhears conversations of students, she says, she very often hears things like, ""Check this out; I have this many likes."" ""It's almost like a little competition for the number of likes,"" Graber said. ""I think that's anxiety-ridden, because you get likes based on how many friends you have, and you have to keep posting things to get more friends and it's like a vicious circle."" Graber says this phenomenon was illustrated by a recent assignment in her classroom. She asked her students to try to go 24 hours without social media during one of three weekends. Middle school transition tough for teens and parents . Of the 28 students, only one was able to do it. The teens couldn't stand not knowing what their friends were doing, Graber said. ""It was very hard. I kept getting tempted by my phone and my friends,"" wrote one student, who said he could last only five hours in his social-media-free zone. Research: Social media can make you feel sad . Studies show that social media can actually make you feel bad about yourself. According to a study last year by the University of Michigan, the more people checked Facebook, the worse they felt about their lives. Another study, this one by German researchers, found that a third of people felt worse after spending time on Facebook, especially if they spent time viewing vacation photographs. Helping students realize the impact of social media on them was a big goal of the summer workshop held by SheKnows.com. That workshop also served as a pilot for a program called Hatch, which was just launched by the company. As part of the new effort, kids ages 9 to 16 create videos for adults, said Samantha Skey, SheKnows.com's chief revenue officer. The informal tag line for the program is ""content for grown-ups made by kids on a mission,"" she said. What counts as a real name on Facebook . ""It's content by kids, but it's really meant to address topics of interest to their parents in many cases,"" she said. ""The mission component is focused on teaching them digital literacy and citizenship while also allowing them to play with digital storytelling."" Reese, an 11th-grader in Los Angeles who participated in the Hatch pilot program, said she didn't really give much thought to the notion that digital media can impact people emotionally until there was a discussion about its psychological effect. ""And I found out that I am kind of neurotic about some things,"" she said. ""For example, when I text someone and I think that I might have made them upset because they didn't reply right away, I automatically assume that they got mad at me."" To prevent that from happening, she admits closing nearly all texts with a smiley, exclamation point or LOL. Sadie, who also participated in the Hatch pilot, says she now looks at Snapchat and Facebook a bit differently. ""I know (they) can also have a negative psychological effect that I feel like didn't occur to me as much,"" she said. Starting conversations early . The takeaway from the workshop, said Skey, was that there is a ""huge opportunity"" to talk with teens about social media. ""A lot of them say that educators are not talking to them about media and social media unless they're telling them not to do something."" Talking about social media early and often is key, says Graber, who did a demonstration this month for principals and other educators from across the state of California on how she teaches digital literacy and citizenship to teens. How to cut your child's cell phone addiction . ""I always say to parents: It's not one conversation. It's a thousand small conversations, and it is really starting young,"" she said. Take an interest in what your children are doing online and have them show you why they like it, she said. ""And then you are in the circle,"" she added. ""It's pretty easy to get there but you have to start when they are young."" Graber, who starts teaching students in the sixth grade, said it often takes her students until the eighth grade to figure out all the social media angst ""ain't worth it."" ""It's a huge trajectory to get there ... when they start saying, 'Gosh that's a waste of my time.' "" Do you get anxious if you don't get a certain number of likes on social media posts? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","The quest for likes and the fear of missing out can cause social media anxiety among teens .

"A trove of emails from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's time in Tallahassee reveal a hands-on chief executive who was a prolific Blackberry user. Bush, who is considering a 2016 presidential run, planned on releasing the tens of thousands of emails next month. But the Washington Post got out ahead of him, obtaining the emails through a public records request and publishing them late Tuesday. While Bush was clearly aware that the emails could go public one day, the notes offer an insider's perspective on Bush's time in office and his dealings on issues ranging from land disputes to funding for a military base in Florida and the state's citrus industry. Here are the top 5 takeaways: . 1. A personal touch . Bush exchanged emails with hundreds of constituents sharing their advice and concerns on specific issues -- with such high-level discussions even including a quick reply to a woman asking for the date of his wife's birthday. Bush even personally responded to job applicants, revealing what the Washington Post called an ""intense, detail-oriented engagement"" as governor. On one of his top issues, for example, Bush received a ""daily immigration update."" 2. ""Awesome"" emails . The former governor also took a casual approach in his emails, which he peppered with words like ""my bad,"" ""chill out"" and ""awesome."" And Bush was also apparently a big believer in the power of the smiley face. As staffers exchanged emails about vacation time, Bush suggested that ""you guys h that you guys have a verbal conversation about it rather than create a public document. :)"" But he also used them to reply to angry emails, like when one man wrote him that ""politicians make me sick, you make me sick."" ""I am truly sorry you feel that way. Have a nice day,"" Bush said, throwing in a smiley face. 3. Cuba . Bush slammed President Barack Obama's decision last week to normalize relations with Cuba, and it's clear from the emails that he's remained consistent on that issue. In a 1999 email, Bush pledged to stand for a tough policy on the island, telling then-Rep. Lincoln Diaz Balart that ""forceful diplomacy can make a difference."" That stance hasn't kept Sen. Marco Rubio, a Bush mentee and potential 2016 foe, from stealing the spotlight last week as he jumped in front of the cameras to become the GOP's leading voice on opposing Obama's engagement with the Cuban regime. 4. Campaign finance reform -- and a brother's shadow . One email exchange with a top GOP donor, Al Hoffman, gives a candid glimpse at Bush's stance on campaign finance laws. In the email, Hoffman encourages Bush to support a campaign finance reform law working its way through the Florida legislature, but the governor balks, explaining that he's only in favor of ""campaign finance reform that doesn't put us at a disadvantage."" And the bill in question, ""would do just that,"" Bush wrote. The exchange also reveals an interesting angle the GOP donor uses as he looks to secure the governor's support. ""Your brother thinks it's the right thing to do,"" Hoffman writes. 5. Conservative criticism . Lauded by many in the GOP establishment as a smart, fiscally conservative governor who delivered economic gains for his state, the emails also reveal a challenge from the party's most conservative members that Bush is likely to face in an eventual GOP presidential primary. He received one email branding him as ""NO CONSERVATIVE"" and regularly took flak from activists who wanted more right-leaning policies out of the governor's mansion, according to the Post. One pro-life activist attacks Bush in an email for appointing a lawyer who represented the owner of an abortion clinic.","Bush personally responds to hundreds of constituent emails and personally answering job applicants .
He also takes a casual approach with plenty of smileys and expressions like ""chill out"" and ""my bad""
The emails also show he's remained consistent on Cuba, and isn't a big campaign finance reform advocate .
And the emails give some insight into the conservative backlash he could face in a 2016 GOP primary ."
"MOSCOW, Russia (Reuters) -- Russia's strategic bombers have resumed the Soviet Union's Cold War practice of flying long-haul missions to areas patrolled by NATO and the United States, generals said on Thursday. A Russian Tu-95 Bear bomber, the type of plane used on long-range sorties into areas patrolled by NATO. A Russian bomber flew over a U.S. military base on the Pacific island of Guam on Wednesday and ""exchanged smiles"" with U.S. pilots who had scrambled to track it, said Maj. Gen. Pavel Androsov, head of long-range aviation in the Russian air force. ""It has always been the tradition of our long-range aviation to fly far into the ocean, to meet [U.S.] aircraft carriers and greet [U.S. pilots] visually,"" Androsov told a news conference. ""Yesterday we revived this tradition, and two of our young crews paid a visit to the area of the [U.S. Pacific Naval Activities] base of Guam,"" he said. President Vladimir Putin has sought to make Russia more assertive in the world. Putin has boosted defense spending and sought to raise morale in the armed forces, which were starved of funding in the chaos that followed the fall of the Soviet Union. Androsov said the sortie by the two turboprop Tu-95MS bombers, from a base near Blagoveshchensk in the Far East, had lasted for 13 hours. The Tu-95, codenamed ""Bear"" by NATO, is Russia's Cold War icon and may stay in service until 2040. ""I think the result was good. We met our colleagues -- fighter jet pilots from [U.S.] aircraft carriers. We exchanged smiles and returned home,"" Androsov said. U.S. officials told CNN, however, that the two bombers came no closer than 100 miles to any U.S. aircraft and no closer than 300 miles to the Navy ships, and that there was no visual contact. Ivan Safranchuk, Moscow office director of the Washington-based World Security Institute, said he saw nothing extraordinary in Moscow sending its bombers around the globe. ""This practice as such never stopped, it was only scaled down because there was less cash available for that,"" he said. ""It doesn't cost much to flex your muscles ... You can burn fuel flying over your own land or you can do it flying somewhere like Guam, in which case political dividends will be higher."" The bombers give Russia the capability of launching a devastating nuclear strike even if the nuclear arsenals on its own territory are wiped out. During the Cold War, they played elaborate airborne games of cat-and-mouse with Western air forces. Lt. Gen. Igor Khvorov, air force chief of staff, said the West would have to come to terms with Russia asserting its geopolitical presence around the globe. ""But I don't see anything unusual, this is business as usual ... like it is normal for the U.S. to fly from its continent to Guam or, say, the island of [Diego]Garcia,"" Khvorov said, referring to a remote Indian Ocean atoll used as a military base by the U.S. On Wednesday,young pilots of strategic bombers passed a series of tests, including missile launches. ""We fired eight cruise missiles, and all hit bull's eye,"" Khvorov said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prince Harry has been withdrawn from Afghanistan because of the media's disclosure of his deployment there, the British Ministry of Defense said Friday. Prince Harry's tour of duty in Afghanistan has ended following media reports of his deployment. The prince had been deployed to Afghanistan since December. Major news outlets agreed to keep the information secret for security reasons, but a Web site broke the news blackout Thursday, prompting the British military to withdraw the prince for security reasons. ""This decision has been taken primarily on the basis that the worldwide media coverage of Prince Harry in Afghanistan could impact on the security of those who are deployed there, as well as the risks to him as an individual soldier,"" the Ministry of Defense said in a statement issued Friday. The ministry termed ""regrettable"" the decision of ""elements of the foreign media"" to reveal Prince Harry's service in Afghanistan. ""Whilst it had been intended that Prince Harry should return in a matter of weeks with the remainder of the Household Cavalry Regiment Battlegroup,"" the ministry said, ""the situation has now clearly changed."" Watch Prince Harry head home » . The British Ministry of Defense confirmed to CNN that Harry was en route late Friday from Afghanistan to Great Britain. Gen. Richard Dannatt, the chief of Britain's General Staff, said in a statement released Thursday that he judged it safe to send the prince to Afghanistan -- so long as the media didn't reveal his location. ""I am very disappointed that foreign Web sites have decided to run this story without consulting us,"" Dannatt said. ""It was my judgment that with an understanding with the media not to broadcast his whereabouts, the risk in (deploying him to Afghanistan) was manageable."" British Defense Secretary Des Browne said Friday that Prince Harry was able to deploy to Afghanistan only ""because of the cooperation of the media, who exercised a degree of discipline and I think that they should be commended for the fact that they have allowed him that space and time so we could manage the risks associated with that.""  Watch the prince's redeeming tour of duty » . He added, ""It is disappointing that the story has broken in the way in which it did."" Withdrawing Prince Harry from Afghanistan was ""a decision that has been made by the defense staff, and I think everybody will respect that to be the right decision,"" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Friday. ""What matters is the safety of Prince Harry."" He added, ""I think the whole country owes Prince Harry a debt of gratitude for his service, his courage, his bravery, under the most difficult of circumstances in Afghanistan."" The 23-year-old prince holds the rank of cornet -- equivalent to a second lieutenant -- and serves as a forward air controller with a group called Joint Tactical Air Control, or JTAC. ""At the end of the day I like to sort of be a normal person, and for once I think this is about as normal as I'm ever going to get,"" he said in a recent interview. ""As far as I'm concerned, I'm out here as a normal JTAC on the ground and not as Prince Harry.""  Watch reaction to Prince Harry's withdrawal » . Queen Elizabeth II, who was visiting an elderly care home in Windsor on Friday, acknowledged a resident's compliment of her grandson. ""Can I say to you, ma'am, I'm very proud of Harry, Prince Harry, of the job he's doing,"" said the man, a former soldier who was not identified. Because of the unique circumstances of the deployment, CNN, as well as other news organizations, chose to honor an embargo requested by the military. His duties included calling in airstrikes and air support when necessary, guaranteeing the accuracy of bombing on the ground and guarding against incidents of friendly fire. Prince Harry is the younger son of Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and the late Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997. Last year, the military ruled he could not be sent to Iraq because publicity about the deployment could put him and his unit at risk. But Dannatt said the experience has demonstrated ""that it is perfectly possible for Prince Harry to be employed just the same as other Army officers of his rank and experience."" ""His conduct on operations in Afghanistan has been exemplary,"" the general said. ""He has been fully involved in operations and has run the same risks as everyone else in his battle group. In common with all of his generation in the army today, he is a credit to the nation."" Shortly after the news of the prince's deployment broke, several Islamist Web sites posted messages alerting their ""brethren"" in Afghanistan to be on the lookout for the royal soldier. ""O brothers of monotheism, if you find anyone with unusual security in his battalion, know that this could be the Prince Harry. We ask God that he gets caught on your hands,"" one such posting read. Several members of the British royal family saw combat in the past century. Prince Harry's grandfather, Prince Phillip, served aboard warships in World War II; his great-grandfather -- the future King George VI -- took part in the World War I naval battle of Jutland; and Prince Andrew, Prince Harry's uncle, flew Navy helicopters during Britain's 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands. Prince Harry's brother, Prince William, is also an army officer. But as second in line for the throne, he is specifically barred from combat. The last sitting British monarch to lead troops in battle was George II, who defeated a French force at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743.

"As a 36-year cancer survivor, I am watching with great interest as the debate rages over whether the Affordable Care Act strengthens the individual insurance market, as the law's supporters contend, or dismantles it, as critics say. Having been repeatedly denied health coverage I needed and wanted to buy because of my pre-existing condition, I know that provisions of the law can dramatically improve the quality and cost of insurance for people shopping for coverage on their own. I was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia as a college student. After nearly five years of aggressive chemotherapy, immunotherapy, bone marrow harvests and more, I was cancer-free. My cancer has never returned, but since then I have waged a battle of a different kind -- a three-decade struggle to obtain quality, affordable coverage. I spent a few years on my parents' health plan as a student -- long before the new law guaranteed that parents' policies can cover their children through age 26. Later I joined my husband's work-based plan. It wasn't until he got laid off and our COBRA coverage expired that I discovered how difficult it would be to buy a health plan on my own. I shopped around, but as soon as I revealed my pre-existing condition, I was denied coverage -- no further questions asked. My appeals were unsuccessful, and insurers wouldn't even sell me a plan at some sky-high price. I went to California's high-risk pool for uninsured people with pre-existing conditions, but the option to pay $1,800 a month for flimsy coverage that would have left my three young children uninsured was not really an option at all. After months of searching, I found an expensive plan with limited benefits through a professional association, and ever since I have paid to be a member of the organization just so I can maintain coverage. For 15 years my sons and I have struggled to afford the plan's annual deductibles of up to $3,000 per person and monthly premiums that have risen about 30% each year. Every couple of years I reduced our coverage and gave up our trusted providers to avoid yet another premium increase, until we reached the plan's minimum coverage level. Now a single mom with three sons to put through college, I've had to make some very tough choices. The situation is similar for the millions of uninsured people across the country who are living with cancer or another pre-existing condition. For decades, we have been denied coverage outright, charged exorbitantly expensive premiums for limited coverage and forced to pay tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for lifesaving care. It's no wonder that high medical bills are a major cause of family bankruptcies, or that seriously ill patients have died because they could not get the treatment that could have extended or even saved their life. The health care law offers people like me a choice of health plans sold in online marketplaces in every state. Each plan must cover essential benefits needed to prevent and treat cancer or another serious disease, and no plan can turn down someone with a pre-existing condition or charge them more than they would a healthy person. No one will have coverage revoked if he or she gets sick or terminated if his or her plan's coverage reaches an arbitrary limit. Patients will not have to pay for preventive tests such as mammograms, and many people with low or moderate incomes could get tax credits that help them afford coverage. I visited California's marketplace, CoveredCA.com, on October 1 -- the day it went live. At first I encountered technical problems, as so many others have, that were caused in part by the large number of people trying to find coverage. But I knew I had until December 15 to enroll for coverage to begin January 1. Recently I tried again and enrolled in my chosen plan in about 15 minutes. In January, for the first time since my diagnosis 36 years ago, I will have an individual health plan that offers quality coverage for me and my family. I will save $628 every month on premiums. Best of all -- I wasn't even asked if I've ever had cancer.","Lori Greenstein Bremner says she had problems getting insurance after surviving cancer .

"An attack by snipers on a Silicon Valley power substation last year is prompting the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to launch a crusade to better secure and defend the nation's electrical grid. The former chairman, Jon Wellinghoff, now a San Francisco energy law attorney, called the little-publicized April 2013 attack on the substation a ""very well planned, coordinated and executed attack on a major piece of our electric grid infrastructure."" While Wellinghoff has expressed concern that the attack may have been a test run for a bigger strike -- possibly terrorism -- the FBI has declared the incident wasn't an act of terror and is still investigating the case, with no arrests made. The FBI considers the incident vandalism, said spokesman Peter Lee in San Francisco. ""There is no nexus to terrorism at this time,"" Lee said. Nonetheless, Wellinghoff is urging Congress to fill a void in federal law that he says doesn't empower any federal agency to demand better security around electrical substations, which he describes as barely protected with a chain-link fence and cameras. Even those cameras don't capture details outside the fence, because they are more focused inside it, he added. Last year's sabotage was carried out by at least one sniper at a good distance from the fence, outside the camera's focus, Wellinghoff said. ""We need to have a national coordinated plan, and we have to have a federal agency that is in charge,"" Wellinghoff said. So far, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, has joined the call for improved security. The matter was addressed at a December hearing of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which Waxman is the ranking member. ""Just this April, there was an actual attack on our electricity infrastructure,"" Waxman said, referring to the Silicon Valley shooting. ""This was an unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military-style weapons. Communications were disrupted. The attack inflicted substantial damage. It took weeks to replace the damaged parts. ""The nation's critical infrastructure and defense installations simply cannot function without electricity. Yet it is clear that the electric grid is not adequately protected from physical or cyberattacks,"" Waxman said in a statement. In all, 150 rounds from an assault rifle were fired over almost 20 minutes at a Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation south of San Jose, California, knocking out 17 transformers in the post-midnight darkness of April 16, according to PG&E, Wellinghoff and CNN affiliate KTVU. To prevent a blackout to Silicon Valley, workers re-routed power, but it took almost a month to make repairs, the affiliate reported. Authorities also found an AT&T fiber optic cable was cut in an underground vault, causing a phone blackout, Sgt. Kurtis Stenderup with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office told KTVU. By the time police arrived, the shooters, also suspected of damaging the phone line, were gone. At the time, the incident wasn't publicized, but since he stepped down as FERC chairman in November, Wellinghoff is raising public attention to the California sniper's attack to demonstrate the vulnerability of the nation's electricity system. Waxman is apparently endorsing Wellinghoff's initiative. Waxman is urging Congress to pass legislation that would ""fix this gap in regulatory authority"" and empower FERC to directly address threats to the nation's power grid. In 2010, the U.S. House passed such a measure, called the GRID Act, but the Senate didn't act on the proposal, Waxman said. The federal government relies on an energy industry organization ""to develop reliability standards for the electric grid through a protracted, consensus-based process,"" Waxman said. After the California vandalism, Arkansas also saw last year ""multiple attacks on power lines and grid infrastructure that led to millions of dollars in damage and brief power outages,"" Waxman said. PG&E officials said they have redundancies built into their electric grid ""that enable us to reroute power around damaged equipment and help keep the lights on for our customers,"" said spokesman Brian Swanson. ""Since the incident occurred, PG&E has worked aggressively with federal and local agencies to improve substation security throughout our system,"" Swanson said. ""The utility industry and stakeholders like the Edison Electric Institute are meeting with policy makers, government officials and law enforcement at all levels to engage in constructive dialogue and share information on how we can work together to protect the grid across the country."" The institute, an association of shareholder-owned electric companies, says security and protection are ""top priorities."" ""Electric companies are partnering closely with each other and with senior officials from all relevant federal and law enforcement agencies to protect the grid's most critical assets,"" said Scott Aaronson, the institute's senior director of national security policy. But he noted that ""publicizing clearly sensitive information about critical infrastructure protection endangers the safety of the American people and the integrity of the grid."" In the meantime, Wellinghoff is urging utilities to enact low-cost improvements such as replacing chain-link fencing with an opaque barrier that would block a sniper's vision of the substation. Wellinghoff is also recommending movable concrete Jersey barriers as a perimeter around the substations -- to stop any sniper bullets. He's also recommending utilities extend lighting beyond the fence yard, with more sophisticated cameras, so  video can capture saboteurs outside the fence. The California sniper or snipers were 40 to 60 yards outside the substation fence, he said. ""This isn't about this substation or this organized attack,"" Wellinghoff said of the California incident. ""This is more about the larger issue of physical security of these high-voltage substations nationwide and the need to ensure that some defensive measures start to be put in place.""","Snipers fired about 150 bullets at a power substation to Silicon Valley last year .

"In just the past week, questions over the IRS targeting of the tea party and other groups have reached a new level of volume and, frankly, confusion. This, after the tax agency revealed that it lost an unknown number of emails in the investigation due to hard drive crashes from years ago. The most wanted of those missing emails belong to Lois Lerner, who ran the IRS division in charge of tax-exempt status and was the highest-ranking official to be directly connected to the political targeting. Lerner has refused to testify about the controversy, invoking her constitutional right not to do so. Friday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will face sharp questions about the missing emails and hard drive crashes in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee. Here are some key things to know about the IRS controversy: . What do we know about the missing Lois Lerner emails? An unknown number of her emails, dating between 2009 and mid-2011, are missing. The IRS notified Congress last week that they were lost when her computer hard drive crashed in 2011. We don't know exactly how many are missing because a) they are missing and b) the IRS has managed to retrieve 24,000 of the lost emails by searching through the accounts of dozens of other IRS employees who could have been included in those emails. Overall, the IRS has turned over 750,000 pages of documents in the investigation, including 67,000 emails. This investigation's been going on for a year. When did the IRS know about these missing emails? It depends who you ask. When CNN spoke with the IRS commissioner on Tuesday, John Koskinen said that agency investigators knew about the crashed Lerner hard drive in ""late spring."" But the House Ways and Means Committee insists that on that same day, the IRS told them it knew about the problem in February. It is not clear why the IRS waited to tell Congress. Wait. How exactly can government emails be lost forever? Ah yes. Our first question too. During this time period (2009-2011), the IRS capped how much material each employee could keep in an email account to about 1,800 emails. If the employee went above that capacity, the individual had to either delete emails or move them to their hard drive.  All of them on Lerner's hard drive were lost when it crashed. Government to revise proposed regulations on controversial tax-exempt groups . But, didn't the emails stay on a server or somewhere else in the system? The IRS has said no. That during this time period, the only system-wide email storage were backup tapes erased every six months. Thus the only permanent storage of emails was on employees hard drives. The agency changed this policy in May 2013. How do we know Lerner's hard drive really did crash? The IRS has supplied CNN and others with emails between Lerner and the IT department during the time of the crash. At the end of a chain of emails, on August 5, 2011, an employee wrote, ""Unfortunately the news is not good. The sectors on the hard drive were bad which made your data unrecoverable."" Lerner replied, ""I really do appreciate the effort. Sometimes stuff just happens."" What happened to the hard drive? Can the IRS double check for emails? No. According to the Senate Finance Committee, the IRS told them that the hard drive has been ""recycled"" and is no longer accessible.  It is not clear if the hard drive is still in the agency's possession. What about the other missing emails? Did six other hard drives also crash? The House Ways and Means Committee says that this past Monday, the IRS told them that the agency also lost emails belonging to six other IRS employees whose hard drives had also crashed. One of those six employees was particularly important: Nikole Flax, who had worked as chief of staff to the former head of the IRS. Flax was known to be involved in discussions about the tea party targeting. The agency told CNN: ""the IRS in recent days identified other instances where individuals had hard-drive issues. We are still assessing whether any of this data is permanently irretrievable, so it is premature to say that a significant amount of this data was lost as a result of these issues."" GOP-led House votes to hold former IRS official in contempt . Why didn't the IRS tell everyone about the other missing emails? That's not clear. The IRS seemed to only tell one House committee, not other congressional groups, working on the issue. This is a particularly harmful aspect of the controversy to the IRS because the same day that the House committee says it learned of the additional missing emails, the two top senators investigating the matter sat down with Koskinen. And Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, says that neither Koskinen nor the staff with him mentioned the other missing emails. Hatch sent a letter to Koskinen Thursday expressing intense frustration. ""Clearly someone was aware of this information when we met and chose not to disclose it to me,"" he wrote. Hatch later took to the Senate floor and said he didn't feel he could trust information from the IRS any longer. RNC files suit against IRS on Tax Day . Back to all this email, isn't the IRS required to keep every communication? Did the IRS break the law? This could be a significant question and point of debate at Friday's hearing. Federal regulation generally requires agencies to retain items of official record.  The IRS insists that its email policy met that regulation and that the determination of what was ""official"" (vs what was personal) was up to each employee. Thus, the agency asked Lerner and each IRS employee to move any ""official"" email to their hard drive to be saved.  Republicans have already indicated they are not satisfied with that answer. Isn't it hypocritical that the agency requiring taxpayers to keep receipts for three years only kept emails for six months? Lawmakers are raising that precise point.  In response, the IRS says it simply does not have the funds for enough server space to keep every e-mail permanently.  Koskinen estimates that would cost up to $10 million. What is Congress doing about all this right now? There are three committees looking into this.  These efforts are led by Republicans with the exception of what has been a bipartisan investigation underway in the Senate Finance Committee. * House Ways and Means Committee: is holding  its hearing. Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, has also asked the White House to turn over any emails between its offices and Lerner and requested that the Department of Justice launch an investigation and audit into the hard drive crash. * House Oversight Committee: has issued a subpoena for Koskinen to appear at a hearing Monday, June 30. The IRS has not officially responded yet. Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican, led the effort for the House to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for not testifying about the targeting controversy.  The committee is now waiting for the Justice Department to determine how it will handle the contempt charge. * Senate Finance Committee has put its bipartisan report on the IRS controversy on hold.  It was nearly completed last week when the IRS told lawmakers about the Lerner hard drive crash.  Hatch, the top Republican on the panel, has called for an independent investigation into how the IRS has handled congressional requests and the search for information about Lerner.

"Sen. Mary Landrieu is pushing leaders in both parties to vote this week to approve the Keystone XL pipeline -- a move that could boost the embattled Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairwoman's chances of winning another term. ""This has been a project that has lingered far too long. It is clearly supported by 60 or more members of this body,"" Landrieu said on the Senate floor Wednesday, minutes after lawmakers kicked off their post-midterm election lame duck session. The Louisiana Democrat is fighting for her political life ahead of a Dec. 6 runoff election against Republican challenger Bill Cassidy. The Keystone XL pipeline represents a chance for Landrieu to flex her muscles on issues important to her energy-rich state one last time. Republicans have countered her moves by promising Cassidy a seat on the energy panel. ""I'm excited to announce that when elected, Dr. Cassidy will be a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,"" incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement out from Cassidy's campaign. ""I'm confident Cassidy will use this position to succeed where Sen. Landrieu failed."" Landrieu's push comes as House GOP leaders plan to begin debate Thursday to approve the pipeline with a vote slated for Friday. And Cassidy will be sponsoring the bill, giving him a chance to mute any advantages Landrieu might gain on the issue. That didn't seem to bother Landrieu, who pointed to the House's plans on the Senate floor. ""Let me just say, Hallelujah,"" she said. ""I've never seen labor and business come together in my life like I have on this issue,"" Landrieu said. ""I've never seen so many senators cosponsor a bill and yet, because of something I can't quite put my finger on, we haven't yet passed it -- and I think we can do that now, today."" Voters swept Republicans into the Senate majority in this month's midterm election, and  McConnell has signaled the GOP-led chamber is likely to vote on a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline early next year. President Barack Obama has repeatedly said he'd rather let the State Department conclude an independent review before deciding whether to move forward with the pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada to Texas -- though he hasn't said whether he would veto legislation from Congress if lawmakers decide to force his hand on the issue. It's not clear whether Republicans will support Landrieu's bid for a vote while Democrats still control the chamber. But she was lobbying for them to do so on the Senate floor Wednesday. Landrieu said all of the chamber's GOP members are co-sponsors of her bill to approve the pipeline, and that its path forward ""will never, ever be clearer than it is today."" ""Think very carefully before any one of you object, because you are all co-sponsors of the bill,"" she said. ""So just think hard on it before you do it."" Republicans blasted Landrieu for what they called a ""Hail Mary,"" saying that if she had pull with Senate Democratic leadership, she should have used it before the runoff was just weeks away. ""After years of ineffectiveness, this latest Hail Mary is yet another reminder that Mary Landrieu has failed Louisianans for years,"" said National Republican Senatorial Committee spokeswoman Brook Hougesen. ""Voters deserve a Senator that doesn't just show up in the 11th hour for political benefits, but will fight every day to create good jobs and economic opportunity for Louisiana.""

"The United Nations chairman investigating human rights in North Korea said the leaders in the country, including Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, must be held accountable for crimes against humanity and urged the Security Council to bring perpetrators to the International Criminal Court. Michael Kirby, who led the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea, held a meeting in New York on Wednesday and engaged in a fiery debate with envoys from North Korea. Two North Koreans who had escaped the country also spoke. The meeting came just hours after American Jeffrey Fowle landed in Ohio after being freed from the hermit kingdom. ""The question that is before the United Nations now is when we face such a moment of truth, will the United Nations back away because of the steps belatedly taken by North Korea in recent weeks? And my hope is the answer to that question will be no. We don't back away,"" Kirby said. ""We stand for the principles of the United Nations and we expect accountability for great crimes before justice. And that is the right of the people of North Korea."" The meeting was called by Kirby just weeks after the European Union and Japan presented a draft resolution with strong language against North Korea, encouraging others to push the country toward the International Criminal Court. February: 'Abundant evidence' of crimes against humanity in North Korea, panel says . The meeting was also to draw attention to the nation's human rights violations, because Kirby said  there has been an effort in recent weeks for North Korea to appear as if its record has changed. The meeting included multiple rounds of questions and answers between U.N. and North Korean officials. ""I want to scrutinize what they have done,"" Kirby said. He then cited his report on human rights in the country, originally issued in March 2014 to the United Nations, that chronicled crimes against humanity in prison camps and ordinary prisons, crimes that targeted religious believers and starvation of citizens, among other crimes. North Korea issued its own human rights report in response, which it called ""rosy."" North Korea: We have the 'most advantageous human rights system' Kim Song, adviser for political affairs at the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's mission to the United Nations, denounced the U.N. report as ""groundless,"" saying investigators only talked with defectors of a ""negative disposition."" He called those who escaped ""human scum."" Before introducing two witnesses from North Korea, Kirby told the audience to judge for themselves if they are ""human scum"" or witnesses trying to share their story. The witnesses recounted their lives in prison camp and under the control of the government. Kim asked Kirby if he had ever read the North Korean constitution, which, Kim said does not allow for human rights violations. ""I did not read the constitution before I prepared this report cover to cover,"" Kirby said. ""But common experience teaches in some countries where great crimes are done against the people, a constitution and the words of a constitution are not as important as the actions of officials who defied the constitution."" North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' Kirby, a retired Australian judge, said he has read through North Korea's report on human rights and said some statements could be viewed as ""fair comment,"" such as criticism of the United States and other countries for their own human rights records. He urged officials to allow citizens to read his report, translated to Korean. Escaped North Korean Kim Hye Sook rebutted some of the North Koreans' comments at the meeting, after they suggested witnesses were paid to lie. ""I heard from North Korea about the reality that should be reflected in the report. I was a person who lived there for 28 years and I drew a map based on memory of 28 years. I compared that with a satellite image and that was 100% accurate,"" Kim said. ""We don't need to say anything more. I think this really in itself testifies.""","North Korean officials should be brought before international court, U.N. investigator says .

"Walmart has suspended several employees in India as the world's biggest retailer by sales pursues an internal investigation into whether its local joint venture in the promising Asian market violated US anti-corruption laws. The suspensions are related to the US retailer's widening probe into allegations that employees in several key emerging markets bribed government officials. Walmart this month said a probe into allegations that bribes were paid to secure permits for new stores in Mexico had been widened to other emerging markets including India, China and Brazil. On Friday, Walmart said its Indian joint venture with Bharti Enterprises had suspended ""a few associates"", but declined to give any details about those under scrutiny. ""We are committed to conducting a complete and thorough investigation,"" the company said. ""It would be inappropriate for us to comment further until we have finished."" The probe into possible violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribery outside of the US, is another headache for Walmart in India. The retailer hopes to scale up its business following New Delhi's long-awaited decision to allow foreign direct investment in front-end retail business. Walmart is simultaneously being examined by the Reserve Bank of India, which has been asked to determine whether it covertly invested in a chain of 220 convenience stores and hypermarkets in 2010 in contravention of a ban on foreign companies owning any stake in retail businesses. The company on Friday affirmed its commitment to India, saying it remained ""excited about the opportunity to grow our business in one of the world's most vibrant economies, expand opportunities for farmers and help lower the cost of living for families in India"". Walmart and its partner Bharti Enterprises have been working together since 2007 to navigate the complex Indian policy environment for retailing. The two companies set up a 50-50 joint venture, Bharti Walmart, for a wholesaling business, an activity in which India has permitted up to 100 per cent foreign ownership since 2006. Bharti Walmart now runs 17 Best Price Modern Wholesale stores, a cash and carry business. Walmart also provides extensive technical and management support for a chain of consumer retail stores, EasyDay, which is ostensibly wholly owned by Bharti. But claims by an Indian politician that Walmart had ""clandestinely and illegally invested"" $100m in the Easy Day chain triggered a government investigation.","The suspensions are related to the US retailer's probe into allegations that employees bribed government officials .

"The Philippines said Thursday that it had pulled its largest naval vessel away from a remote lagoon in the South China Sea where it was engaged in an uneasy standoff with two Chinese maritime surveillance ships. But the tense situation is not yet resolved, as a Philippine coast guard boat remains at the scene, and a third Chinese ship has arrived, said Raul Hernandez, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs. The Philippine naval vessel -- the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, a 378-foot cutter -- has moved away from the lagoon for ""reprovisioning"" and a decision has not yet been announced on whether it will return, Hernandez said. He said negotiations were continuing with the Chinese in the hope of finding a ""diplomatic solution"" to the impasse at Scarborough Shoal, which both countries claim is ""an integral part"" of their territory. Scarborough Shoal is about 200 kilometers west of the Philippine mainland. ""For now, the ball is on the side of the Chinese,"" Hernandez said. The Philippines sent the Gregorio del Pilar to the area of Scarborough Shoal on Sunday after surveillance aircraft spotted eight Chinese fishing boats anchored inside the lagoon. A boarding team from the Gregorio del Pilar went to inspect the Chinese fishing boats Tuesday morning and found ""large amounts of illegally collected corals, giant clams and live sharks"" inside one of the boats, according to the Philippine government. Later Tuesday, the Gregorio del Pilar reported that the two Chinese surveillance ships had arrived and taken up a position at the mouth of the lagoon, blocking the way to the fishing boats and ""preventing the arrest"" of the fishermen. The Philippines said Thursday that it had sent the coast guard vessel to support the Gregorio del Pilar. It also reported the arrival of the third Chinese vessel, which it said was from China's Bureau of Fisheries. The Chinese Embassy in Manila has complained to the Philippine authorities about ""the harassment of Chinese fishermen,"" China's official news agency, Xinhua, reported Wednesday. China has ""urged the Philippine side to stop immediately their illegal activities and leave the area,"" Xinhua reported, saying that the fishermen were taking shelter in the lagoon ""due to harsh weather conditions."" The embassy is ""engaged in discussions with the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs to seek a solution"" and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, Xinhua said. The South China Sea -- a 1.3 million square mile patch of the Pacific Ocean bracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations -- is dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls that are home to some of the world's most diverse marine life. Also under its waves lie potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil. That prospect has peppered the sea with competing claims from China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. It has also resulted in frequent small-scale clashes. Last year, a spate of incidents took place between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels.","The Philippines and China are locked in an impasse at a lagoon in the South China Sea .

"(CNN) -- Kenyans took to the streets of Nairobi on Monday to send a message to men: Stop attacking women because of the way they dress. The protests followed the latest incident of a woman stripped naked in the capital by a group of men who accused her of ""indecent"" dressing. The attack captured on video last week prompted outrage on social media under the hashtag #mydressmychoice. Protesters marched through downtown carrying placards that read ""My dress, my choice"" while others donned mini-skirts, the same attire the unidentified woman wore when she was attacked. Some men wore dresses to show their support. Others joined the march to rally against the protests, chanting ""don't be naked"" and ""wear clothes."" More photos: #MyDressMyChoice . This is not the first time a woman has been undressed for purported indecent dressing in the East African nation, which is a majority Christian. Such incidents sporadically happen in other major cities, including Nakuru and Mombasa. In the footage posted on YouTube and shown on local television, the woman is confronted by her attackers at a bus stop. She looks terrified as she is pushed and shoved by a group of men, who eventually strip her naked. In the background, attackers yell ""Toa"" -- Swahili for ""take it off!"" as they tug at her clothes. ""It's so sad that these men who strip women are the same same men who ... will go out in the night looking at women who are dressed to kill and they drool over them,"" said Brenda Otieno, who supported the protests in Nairobi. While some applauded the protests, others said they are a distraction from the main issues. ""Kenyans are actually not concerned about clothes ... this is just a media created frenzy trying to redirect the nation's attention away from hard questions like poverty and poor education system,"" Edu Gezuka posted on social media. After the videotaped incident, other instances of women getting undressed have been reported including in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city. The issue in not limited to Kenya. Over the years, such incidents have occurred in other African nations, including Malawi and Zimbabwe. Kenyan authorities have said they are investigating the latest incident. CNN's Daisy Carrington and Rachel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","The incident was captured on a video that went viral last week .

"Washington (CNN)The release of the CIA torture report on Tuesday, detailing brutal post-9/11 interrogation tactics, has led to an array of responses from potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, in an interview with The New York Times released Thursday, moved to the left of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when he called for a ""special prosecutor"" from the Justice Department to look into those who carried out the torture. ""I think there needs to be some accountability so that this doesn't happen again,"" O'Malley said. ""I don't believe the United States should torture. Period. Full stop."" All Democrats eying the presidency are against torture, but so far O'Malley is the only to advocate for a Justice Department investigation. Clinton, during her time of the speaking circuit, has advocated for the release of the torture report but not a special prosecutor. ""I thought we needed more transparency,"" Clinton said at a June event, reflecting on her time as secretary of state. ""I didn't want people to be criminally prosecuted, people who were doing what they were told to do, that there were legal opinions supporting what they were told to do, but I wanted transparency."" She added, ""And that's what Dianne Feinstein is trying to provide with that 6,000-page report. And I think the American people deserve to see it."" A Clinton spokesman has not responded to emails asking for comment after the release of the report. Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a statement on Tuesday after the torture report was released. ""The United States must not engage in torture,"" Sanders said. ""If we do, in an increasingly brutal world, we lose our moral standing to condemn other nations or groups that engage in uncivilized behavior."" Sanders, however, did not comment on a special prosecutor and his spokesman was unable to provide a statement on Thursday from the senator. In a conversation with reporters on Wednesday, Sanders did, however, say that if anyone lied to elected official on torture, ""they should be fired immediately."" And former Sen. Jim Webb, the only Democrat who has announced an exploratory committee into the 2016 race, questioned why lawmakers didn't provide better oversight of the program. ""The policies that allowed or turned a blind eye to these acts are no longer in place. The question is whether the intelligence committees are properly conducting oversight functions today,"" he said in a statement. Webb also sent a number of tweets about the torture report that seemed to cast doubt on why Congress was looking into the matter now. ""Where was the Intelligence Committee when the torture was going on,"" question Webb in one tweet. ""The question is not torture, but how far Congress has descended in its historical oversight role on key issues of foreign policy,"" he said in another.","All 2016 Democrats are against torture, but have varying reactions to this week's torture report release .

"(CNN)Half of the players in Monday night's inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship will walk away with the title of best in their game, but the averages foretell that fewer than 2% will make it in the pros. For the rest, their futures lie elsewhere, and while most of the players taking the field Monday are on scholarship and all of them were given an opportunity for an education, whether that opportunity is realized is another matter. A recent poll shows that American sports fans are not surprised that many athletes will squander their shot at education -- because they or someone else has decided that football should be the No. 1 priority while they are in school, because their classes must fit into practice schedules or because their goals are set by athletic departments rather than academic advisers. The poll also suggests that most fans have lost faith in the notion of the student-athlete. In last week's Monmouth University poll of 1,008 adults, 67% said they thought universities put too much emphasis on their athletic programs, and only 24% thought colleges with big-time programs -- such as the Oregon Ducks and Ohio State Buckeyes, which are taking the field in Arlington, Texas, on Monday -- find the right academic-athletic balance. ""Americans are in love with big-time college sports, but as the Monmouth poll makes clear, they also recognize that many institutes of higher education are not properly balancing the important mix of athletics and academics,"" Monmouth President Paul Brown said in a news release. The NCAA could not be reached for comment on the polling data. Fans feel they know why the balance is off and who's to blame, according to the poll: Three out of four said the pressure of competition in big-time college athletics warps a school's priorities, while 42% of respondents said the NCAA does a poor job of emphasizing the right balance. ""I think the poll has it right. I think America has a pretty good pulse on what's going on,"" said Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, which strives for NCAA reform. Consider the disparity in the numbers. While the average in-state public school scholarship is worth about $15,000 a year and the average private university scholarship is worth about $35,000 annually, according to the NCAA, top-notch football programs stand to make millions by shipping their teams off to bowl games. The SEC and ACC, two of the Power Five football conferences, are projected to reel in more than $80 million each from bowl season, which they'll distribute to their member institutions. A lot of the money comes from TV rights, and the College Football Playoff promises to make those rights even more lucrative, as the two playoff games leading up to Monday's showdown -- the Rose and Sugar bowls -- drew 28.2 million and 28.3 million viewers, respectively, making them the most-watched shows in cable history, according to ESPN, which aired the games. By comparison, last year's Bowl Championship Series final between Auburn and Florida State, also on ESPN, recorded an audience of 25.6 million. The record for viewership in a championship game, 35.6 million, is the 2006 Rose Bowl between Texas and the University of Southern California, which aired on ABC. ""When you're a player, everything tells you that you are there for athletics first,"" Huma said. ""You schedule classes around practice, you have to find a major that you can succeed at around that."" Quarterback Cardale Jones, who will be starting for Ohio State on Monday, apparently received that message when he infamously tweeted as a freshman two years ago, ""Why should we have to go to class if we came here to play FOOTBALL. We ain't come to play SCHOOL classes are POINTLESS."" He was suspended and has since called the tweet ""just a stupid thing to do at that time."" Last year, when football players at Northwestern University -- a school with one of the more admirable academic-athletic reputations -- went to the National Labor Relations Board in an attempt to unionize, it was discovered that during the season, athletes devoted 50 hours a week to their sport. That's well above the NCAA's 20-hour rule, which mandates that student-athletes may engage in ""countable athletically related activities"" for only four hours a day and 20 hours a week during the season, and eight hours a week the rest of the year. Included in those activities are games, practices, film sessions, conditioning, meetings called by coaches and workouts with coaches present, according to the NCAA. When Northwestern's daily football schedule was entered into the record during the labor board hearing, it showed that much of the week was about athletics. The board later ruled in favor of Northwestern football, citing the demanding hours. Commissioner Bob Bowlsby of the Big 12, another Power Five conference, said in 2013 that the 20-hour rule ""is a joke"" because there were ""too many exemptions, too much falsification of records."" Among the activities that do not count toward the 20-hour rule are voluntary workouts, voluntary sports-related activities with no coach present, recruitment activities, traveling to competitions, training room activities, rehabilitation, medical exams and public appearances, the NCAA states. Huma cited basketball's March Madness as a clear example. A team that makes it to the Final Four, the semifinals of the three-week-long tournament, could miss huge chunks of class, he said. Kain Colter, the Northwestern player who started the labor union movement, testified during the March 2014 hearing that he was forced to change his major from pre-med because it didn't fit into his practice schedule. That's something athletes at universities across the country echo, Huma said. ""Ultimately, you can see it in the graduation rates,"" he said. ""Significant time demands are a significant contributor to the poor graduation rates among football and basketball players."" You can also see it in the scandals. There have been 37 academic fraud scandals since 1990, according to research done by the University of Oklahoma's Gerald Gurney and Eric Snyder and Ohio University's David Ridpath, professors working on academic reform. That includes the latest and largest scandal at the University of North Carolina, which was once revered for its ability to produce talented athletes who also succeeded in the classroom. Much of that success has now been called into question, as an independent investigation uncovered an 18-year cheating scandal last year. The investigation, conducted by former Prosecutor Ken Wainstein, found that thousands of athletes who were underprepared or too busy with athletics were funneled into ""paper classes"" where a one-time paper was accepted for an easy grade. Many of those papers were plagiarized, and administrators often knew it, the investigation found. ""I think the UNC example stands as a testimony to what little opportunity these athletes have for a real education,"" said Gurney, who is current president of the Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport. ""The NCAA and (its president) Mark Emmert, specifically Mark Emmert, promise athletes a world-class education, and that simply is not true and a boldface lie when it pertains to football and men's basketball players in Division I."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Poll: Only 24% feel programs like Oregon, Ohio State find academic-athletic balance .

"A Philadelphia Catholic priest was sentenced Wednesday to six to 12 years in prison, and a teacher at the same parish was sentenced to eight to 16 years in prison in a case involving the sexual assault of an elementary school student. The Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, was convicted in January for the indecent assault of a 10-year-old boy in the late 1990s. The parochial teacher, Bernard Shero, who authorities said raped the same boy in 2000, was convicted of rape, attempted rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, indecent sexual assault and other charges. Philadelphia archdiocese finds 2 priests unsuitable for ministry . Both men also must serve five years of probation after prison, the judge ordered at Wednesday's sentencing. ""This prison sentence sends a clear message to sexual assault victims in Philadelphia. If you come forward, you will be heard,"" Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. ""I would also like to compliment the jury for its hard work in carefully sifting through the evidence and coming up with a just verdict."" The victim, now in his 20s, reported to authorities in 2009 that he was sexually abused while he was in Catholic grade school by Engelhardt, Shero and another priest, Edward Avery. A grand jury determined his allegations had merit, and the priests were subsequently charged and arrested. They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in the grand jury report. Avery pleaded guilty after admitting he sexually assaulted the boy and was sentenced to 2½ to five years in prison. Besides indecent assault, Engelhardt also was convicted of endangering the welfare of a child, corruption of a minor and conspiracy. Shero's other convictions were for endangering the welfare of a child and corruption of a minor.","Priest, teacher were convicted of assaulting boy in separate incidents more than decade ago .

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- ""The tunnels were the most difficult part, especially because the Caucasus range [is made up of] immature mountains,"" Andrey Panenkov, the acting chief engineer of the Adler-to-Krasnaya Polyana road, tells CNN. ""This is not dense rock such as granite, this breed is young with soft ground, so they are liable to move."" Panenkov is a bear of a man. He stands around 6'6"" and has the steely, no-nonsense eyes of an engineer hardened by previous victorious battles with many-a-stubborn environment (see bottom of page). If his spade-like hands could not carve a passage through mountains he likens to an irritating teenager, you fear there would be no others that could. ""[Their movement] is impossible to measure ... but voids and faults occur due to water in the rock, it loosens the joints and seams. ""But we had some special methods to achieve a positive result,"" Panenkov says of the Herculean task he helped to deliver. Special methods that would have come in very handy when you're faced with boring 30 km of tunnel through big lumps of adolescent rock which are prone to jostling. To be more precise this entailed: six complex boring machines and 14 ""harvesters"", which transport the rubble and soil away from the mountain face, along with various drilling and blasting methods. The 25-mile highway that joins the coastal Winter Games site in Sochi with the alpine venues nearly 2000 feet above sea level in Krasnaya Polyana, entailed many such challenges for the team of designers, engineers and builders assigned to the project. Erected in just five years the motorway, that ascends the foothills by soaring over the path of a river valley, is something of a technical marvel. By working with consultants from Italy, Spain and Switzerland a 37 km flyover has been constructed, across all impediments, to deliver travelers from one end to the other in around 30 minutes when free of traffic. The tunnels are many, the steel bridges are myriad and concrete support structures, which hold the transport arteries in the air, creep up the snow-capped slopes like a giant, monolithic ivy. A new railway line, which also traverses the same physical obstacles, runs parallel to the road too. But it's the cost, which totaled an eye-watering $9 billion according to the Wall Street Journal, that led to the road making headlines. Many in the media touted the freeway, that Panenkov's 150-man team played a role in building, as the ""world's most expensive road"", with stories abounding of how it would have been cheaper to lay its surface with caviar than the tarmac used. The narrative played into a wider questioning of the $50 billion spent on the Sochi project by the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A fear that former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov alluded to in a report titled ""Winter Olympics in the Sub-Tropics: Corruption and Abuse in Sochi,"" published last year, where he stated that $20-30 billion had been spent on ""embezzlement and kickbacks."" But it's an accusation that Oleg Toni -- vice president of Russian Railways, the company that delivered the road and rail infrastructure for the Games and sponsor of CNN's Olympic coverage -- totally rejects. ""In this era of the Internet it's impossible to do something closed and dishonest. Russian Railways is a global company and we are looked at carefully. ""We've had over 1,500 thousand inspections, in such conditions it is impossible to hide something. Excuses are pointless because everyone can come and see the tenders [we submitted]. ""In politics it's always easy to criticize others. [Nemtsov] was not responsible for anything, and if he knows where the money went then please show us! In our country there are organizations that verify this."" Despite the initial ambition of the task giving him sleepless nights, Toni now speaks of his pride in the construction achieved. He would not confirm the overall cost, but he told CNN the reporting of the investment had sometimes missed the point, in his view. ""Conditions were given to us: we have to carry a certain number of passengers by train and by car in this location. ""Yes, you can compare some figures and individual indicators to suggest something ... but it's pointless to compare this with a road that runs from Paris to Lyon [because it's a different environment],"" Toni told CNN. ""We've built four new train stations and these will serve the population for several generations. ""Down the road in Adler there is a tunnel built 120 years ago ... but the decision to build it was right because it has been used so much. All infrastructure pays off in this way."" There were 10 parts to the Russian Railways construction project in Sochi: two cargo terminals, updating the old Adler -Tuapse railway line, building four new stations and then the linking road transport networks, updating Sochi airport and building a freight and train-servicing plant. Some say much of the building came at an environmental cost. After all, Sochi sits in close proximity to one of the largest natural parks in Europe, a fact that had Alexander Valov, chief editor of Blog Sochi, concerned from the start. ""I think that in any city, roads and social infrastructure should be built regardless of the Olympic Games but some of the money should be spent on ecology because the nature of this area was damaged greatly,"" Valov told CNN. But Toni attests great attention was paid to the environment with ""special technical solutions"" used to keep damage to the national park to a minimum. As a Moscovite, Toni ultimately sees the Sochi project and his road as a good news story: ""I am glad ... that people will recognize that in our country there is something positive. The more that people know, the more tourists will come, and therefore, our infrastructure will be in demand [for a long time in the future]."" Whatever the amount that was invested, the true value -- like that of the 120-year-old tunnel -- will take a time period greater than the Winter Olympics to judge.","A highway built for the 2014 Sochi Games has been dubbed the world's most expensive road .

"Images from the conflict between Israel and Hamas depict apparent civilians, innocent people caught in the middle. Often, the dead are children. The Palestinian death toll in Gaza stands at more than 1,800, with nearly 10,000 wounded, Gaza's Health Ministry said Sunday. More than 300 children have died, the ministry has reported, as the United Nations repeatedly raises concerns about the high number of deaths in Gaza. On the Israeli side, 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians have died since fighting began more than three weeks ago. Why are the death tolls lopsided? Why so many deaths in Gaza? Here are five reasons that dictate the brutal logic of the latest Mideast crisis. Uneven resources . While Hamas has shown itself to be a formidable guerrilla army, Israel's military dwarfs the resources available to the militant Islamic organization, which controls Gaza. Hamas does not have the sophisticated weaponry and technology that Israel possesses. Consider Israel's Iron Dome system, which intercepts and blocks incoming rockets. The Israeli military has said that it has depleted most of Gaza's rocket supply and Israel Defense Forces says more than 3,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel. Unlike Gaza, Israel has bomb shelters and an advanced warning system to let its population know when and where rockets are coming in. Hundreds of thousands of people have reportedly downloaded Red Alert, a smartphone app that uses real-time information from the IDF and the country's version of Homeland Security to trigger a phone's alarm when rockets are detected. Illustrating just how powerful Israel is in this battle, Israel has been texting Palestinians' cell phones with messages warning where the Israeli military will strike. Palestinians have told CNN they are receiving these messages. Israel has also been doing what it calls ""roof knocking"" -- or dropping empty shells on rooftops -- warning those inside buildings to get out fast because a strike with explosive shells is imminent. ""Civilian casualties in Gaza have been too high,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said in Washington on Thursday. ""It is clear the Israelis need to do more. We want them to do more."" The nature of the battlefield . More than 1.8 million people live in Gaza, which is 139 square miles in total land area. That makes for very cramped living. When airstrikes happen, when shells land, having more people in a small area often means higher death tolls. And even if Palestinians receive and heed warnings to change locations before an airstrike hits, it's likely they'll have nowhere safe to run. There are no bomb shelters or warning sirens in Gaza. And it's practically impossible to leave. There's a barrier fence around the perimeter of Gaza. Israel controls all air access to Gaza and land access along their border. Egypt controls access on the southern border and that crossing is also closed. United Nations schools in Gaza -- with clear U.N. markings -- have been turned into shelters during the conflict, and for a while they were considered safe. But strikes have recently hit several of those locations, killing and injuring many, including women and children. Each side blames the other. In some cases, Israel has said Hamas rockets were launched and fell short, landing on the schools, and stressed that it uses ""precision"" airstrikes. Regarding shells that fell in the vicinity of a school on Sunday, killing at least nine people, the IDF said it targeted three Palestinian Islamic Jihad members riding a motorcycle in the vicinity of the school. It said it's reviewing the incident. Hamas says Israel targeted the schools. A goal that could take time . One of Israel's top goals is to destroy Hamas rockets and tunnels. It says it has uncovered 36 tunnels running from Gaza into Israel that have been used to smuggle weapons and launch attacks. Hamas has released videos of militants using the tunnels for attacks. The main way to obliterate the tunnels is by airstrikes and artillery bombardment, and those tactics often result in collateral damage. The tunnels have, for some time, also been used as vital supply lines to Gaza, through which food and other necessities have been transported. The tunnels were dug to get around the blockade of Gaza, said Maen Rashid Areikat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization delegation to the United States. But Areikat told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, who toured a tunnel, that the tunnels have also been used by a faction of Palestinians to launch attacks in Israel. Palestinian parliament member Mustafa Barghouti described the tunnels as a defensive tool against repeated Israeli invasions in recent years. Watch: CNN's Blitzer goes into a tunnel in Gaza . Effort to protect civilians? Is Hamas willing to put civilians in harm's way? That's a controversial topic. Last month, rockets were discovered in a vacant U.N. school between two other U.N. schools being used as shelters. It was the second such discovery at a vacant U.N. school in Gaza in a week. That is the evidence Israel cites to accuse Hamas of using civilians and their institutions as shields -- a violation of international law. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on CNN that it was difficult to measure the bloodshed of the conflict because ""Hamas is using them, Palestinians, as human shields."" ""We develop anti-missile systems to protect, we use anti-missile systems to protect our civilians,"" he said. ""They use their civilians to protect their missiles. That's the difference."" The IDF said Monday it found a ""Hamas combat manual"" that IDF says proves the group uses its people as human shields. A CNN translation of the two pages posted by the IDF did not find specific statements that Hamas uses its own civilian population as human shields, but one section discusses the benefits for Hamas when civilian homes are destroyed. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the manual, and neither the IDF nor Hamas could be reached for comment. Experts say the situation is complex. Hamas is also a political organization embedded in civilian life in the Palestinian territory, Palestinian leaders say. ""Hamas is a political party after all, not just a military wing. And it has institutions, organizations, homes"" in Gaza, said Hanan Ashrawi, executive committee member of the PLO in the West Bank. She pointed out that large buildings are being hit, and many are dying inside. ""It would be impossible at this point to say how much truth there is to the human shield argument,"" said Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""That's not going to be possible to do in the heat of the conflict."" The timetable is uncertain . Last week, the Israeli military said it was calling up 16,000 reservists, an indication that there is likely more fighting ahead. United States diplomacy has tried to turn the situation toward a lasting cease-fire. Several Middle Eastern nations attempted to get Hamas to agree to an Egyptian-led cease-fire while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Palestinian and Israeli leaders last week. But by Thursday evening, rockets were still flying and sirens were going off. Several cease-fires have fallen apart since. U.N. Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a speech recently that she felt there is a ""strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes."" ""I unequivocally reiterate to all actors in this conflict that civilians must not be targeted,"" she said, adding, ""Respect for the right to life of civilians, including children, should be a foremost consideration.""","Officials: More than 1,800 people have died; 64 Israeli soldiers have died .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has gone to the dogs, and at least one justice found the results to be laughable. The HBO television news satire ""Last Week Tonight"" found a clever way to illustrate the court's public sessions, which are closed to cameras. Audio of the oral arguments-- where the justices debate the issues with opposing counsel-- is recorded and made available to the public. The solution-- pair each of the nine robed justices-- as well as the lawyers and court staff-- with a dog (or a duck in one case), with fake paws. It's an exercise in democracy that has to be watched for the full effect. The work of the court is very important, but the current courtroom setup without cameras is ""boring"" to the general public, making media coverage ""unwatchable,"" said the show's host John Oliver. But with animals sitting on a mock bench over actual audio of the nine justices, ""the video makes it irresistible."" The featured case was from earlier this month, over whether a Muslim prisoner had a First Amendment right to keep his beard for religious reasons, in the face of strict security policies by corrections officers. ""I thought it was hilarious,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said of the dog video at a Washington event earlier this week. ""And I imagine my colleagues who have seen it would share that view."" Ginsburg was portrayed as a Chihuahua, complete with glasses. For the record the other members of the court and their canine counterparts: Chief Justice John Roberts (German shorthaired pointer); and Justices Antonin Scalia (bulldog); Anthony Kennedy (boxer); Clarence Thomas (Rottweiler); Stephen Breyer (beagle); Samuel Alito (Portuguese water dog); Sonia Sotomayor (Boston terrier); and Elena Kagan (bull terrier). The playfully mocking tone of the skit raises a more serious concern. There have been calls for years to allow cameras in the court, for public benefit. A television ad released in February urged the justices to do just that, saying, ""It's time for a more open judiciary."" The biggest concerns raised by the justices are that having cameras will upset the personal dynamic between them that make oral arguments so unique and useful to their later deliberations and opinion-writing. Most of them-- past and present-- have been opposed to cameras, while denying they operate in ""secret."" Scalia and the now-retired David Souter have been particularly outspoken. Souter told a congressional panel in 1996 that cameras in the high court would come ""over my dead body."" Scalia has said he worried the media would only air tiny snippets of video from a detailed case being argued, thereby giving a distorted impression of what the court does. ""It's news entertainment, and whatever, and they (the media) want 'man bites dog' stories,"" he has said. ""They don't want people to watch what the Supreme Court does over the course of a whole hour argument."" For the record, no man bit any of the dogs in the making of the new video, but one animal was seen drinking sloppily from a glass. On the bench, the justices wear plain black robes and are referred to by their official title. Off the bench, however, the court's oldest member might prefer a t-shirt and her fresh moniker: Notorious R.B.G. A hip fan page tribute to the pioneering jurist on the microblogging site Tumblr-- ""Ruth Bader Ginsburg in all her glory""-- includes a way to show your admiration-- buy a t-shirt featuring the diminutive Brooklyn native. Ginsburg certainly has. She told NPR's Nina Totenberg at a New York event earlier this month that she gives them away to friends. ""I think a law clerk told me about this Tumblr and also explained to me what Notorious RBG was a parody on. And now my grandchildren love it and I try to keep abreast of the latest that's on the Tumblr,"" she said. ""I have quite a large supply"" of the shirts. Ginsburg has previously applauded Shana Knizhnik, a law student at New York University, who created the site and the nickname-- a play on the late rapper Biggie Smalls, who was also known as Notorious B.I.G. It's not the only Ginsburg-palooza floating around popular culture. After her recent sharp dissents in cases involving affirmative action and voting rights gained national attention,activists began placing homemade stickers around the nation's capital, labeled ""Can't Spell Truth Without Ruth.""

"The longest-serving lawmaker in U.S. congressional history, a legendary Motown artist, and the matriarch of a renowned political family will be among this year's recipients of the nation's highest civilian honor, the White House announced Monday. Rep. John Dingell, Stevie Wonder and Ethel Kennedy are three of the nineteen Americans who Obama will bestow the Presidential Medal of Freedom upon later this month. Dingell has served nearly 60 years in Congress representing a district outside Detroit. He'll retire at the end of this session. Wonder has won 25 Grammys and an Oscar for his fusion of soul, rhythm and blues and jazz. And Kennedy, who is the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, became an activist for human rights and the environment after her husband's death. Other honorees this year include Meryl Streep, the prolific actress known for holding the most Oscar nominations of any actor in history. She stars this winter in ""Into the Woods,"" the musical composed by Stephen Sondheim, to whom Obama will also award the Medal of Freedom on November 24. Tom Brokaw, the former ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor, will be honored as well, alongside actress Marlo Thomas, golfer Charles Sifford and author Isabel Allende. The other medalists are scientist Mildred Dresselhaus; Native American activist Suzan Harjo; former Reps. Abner Mikva of Illinois and Patsy Takemoto Mink of Hawaii; and economist Robert Solow.

"An imam and leader of the Shiite Muslim community in Trinidad and Tobago was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to attack a New York airport by exploding fuel tanks and fuel pipelines under the airport, the Justice Department said Friday. Kareem Ibrahim and several other co-conspirators believed the 2007 planned attack would cause extensive damage to John F. Kennedy International Airport and to the New York economy, as well as kill many people, officials said. Ibrahim, 65, was convicted in May by a federal jury on multiple terrorism offenses after a four-week trial. The plot originated in 2006 when Russell Defreitas, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Guyana who used to work at JFK as a cargo handler, planned the attack and then recruited others, according to officials. In May 2007, Defreitas gave Ibrahim video surveillance and satellite imagery of the targets because Ibrahim had connections to militant leaders in Iran, the Justice Department said. During cross-examination at trial, Ibrahim admitted he advised the plotters to present the attack plan to revolutionary leaders in Iran and to use operatives ready to engage in suicide attacks at the airport, according to the Justice Department. On one of the recorded conversations entered into evidence, Ibrahim told Defreitas the attackers must be ready to ""fight it out, kill who you could kill and go back to Allah."" Ibrahim was arrested along with two others in Trinidad in June 2007 and later extradited to the United States. He was convicted of conspiracy to attack a public transportation system, conspiracy to destroy a building by fire or explosive, conspiracy to attack aircraft and aircraft materials, conspiracy to destroy international airport facilities, and conspiracy to attack a mass transportation facility, the Justice Department said. Defreitas was arrested in New York and convicted of terrorism charges in 2010 and sentenced to life in prison.","Kareem Ibrahim was convicted in May of conspiring to attack JFK airport .

"The closing ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics on Sunday night took viewers through what organizers called an artistic look at Russian culture before International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach closed what he called the ""Athletes' Games."" In his closing remarks, Bach focused on how the athletes have promoted unity throughout the world. ""By living together under one roof, you have sent a message from Sochi. The message is of a society of peace, tolerance and respect,"" he said. The sublime ceremony began with organizers poking fun at themselves and an opening ceremony malfunction. As hundreds of silvery ""fish"" swam in the ""Black Sea"" on the floor of the stadium, they began to form the five Olympic rings. But like in the opening ceremony, one of the dots of white light failed to open -- at first. Eventually, it sprang into form, to much laughter and cheers. There also were two final medal ceremonies, including the crowd-pleasing awards for the top three -- all Russians -- in the men's 50-kilometer cross-country ski race. The closing ceremony featured 62 classical pianists playing at one time, members of the Bolshoi and Kirov ballets performing moments from some of their most famous productions, and a tribute to Russian literary heroes like  Leo Tolstoy and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. ""We arrived with great respect for the rich and varied history of Russia. We leave as friends of the Russian people,"" Bach said. The Olympic flag was lowered and given to representatives of Pyeongchang, South Korea, the host city for the Winter Olympics in four years. The closing ceremony brings to an end 16 days of competition during which a record 98 sets of medals were awarded. The host nation finished atop the medal standings, with 13 golds among its 33 medals.","IOC president calls Sochi Winter Olympics the ""Athletes' Games""

"(CNN) -- American officials say there is strong evidence that Shiite militias in Iraq are using Iranian weapons to attack U.S. troops, comments that followed reports that Iraqi security forces began cracking down on the groups near Iran's border. Materials found following recent attacks against U.S. troops ""have been traced back to Iranian origin,"" an official told CNN. The claim supports the U.S. military position that the militias are backed by Iran, a charge Tehran has long denied. The material collected indicates the militias are using Iranian materials in ""Improvised Rocket-Assisted Munitions"" attacks against U.S. forces, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Saturday. The official was not authorized to release the information to the media. The munitions, or IRAMS, are metal canisters packed with explosives and propelled by rockets. IRAMS along with armor-piercing grenades are believed responsible for the majority of U.S. deaths in recent months, the official said. The official acknowledged the weapons could have been assembled and manufactured elsewhere, but said IRAMS are a signature weapon of the militant group Kataib Hezbollah, which is ""funded by Iran and receives training there. "" The news about the weapons arose as Iraqi security forces began a crackdown in the volatile Maysan province, a Shiite stronghold in southern Iraq that serves as one of the main arteries from Iran. The U.S. military has not been asked by the Iraqi government ""to provide any substantial assistance so far to the operations reported in Maysan province,"" Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the top U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, told CNN. Iraq's southern provinces make up the majority of the Shiite heartland, home to the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf. It is in this area where a majority of the Shiite militia attacks have been launched against U.S. troops, who operate from a number of bases in the region. ""While it is clear these militias receive training and weapons from Iran -- using them as proxies for Iran's own agendas in the region -- we have no evidence of Iranian forces being directly engaged in the recent violence in Iraq,"" Buchanan said in an email late Saturday. Buchanan said the United States is encouraged by the Iraqi operation, though the security in Iraq remains complex. While violence has dramatically fallen off since the height of sectarian violence that nearly tore the country apart, attacks and bombings remain a daily occurrence. The recent increase in attacks pushed June's death toll to the highest this year for Iraqi security forces and civilians. More than 270 people, including 155 civilians, were killed in attacks, Iraqi authorities said. Fourteen U.S. soldiers were also killed in combat-related incidents in June, the largest loss of life among U.S. troops in Iraq since 2008, according to CNN figures. The roughly 47,000 American troops in Iraq are due to withdraw by January 1, 2012, under a U.S.-Iraqi security pact, though Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is consulting with lawmakers over whether to request troops stay beyond the deadline. The U.S. military has said the Shiite-militias -- Kataib Hezbollah, Asaib al Haq, and the Promise Day Brigade -- are using the bombings to try to take credit for driving American forces out of the country. ""If anything, these groups have proven to be resilient and we have no doubt they will continue to conduct violent attacks in the months ahead,"" Buchanan said. He said Iraq's best weapon against the violence was to continue targeting the groups. CNN's Fattah Mahmood Fattah contributed to this report.","Materials found following recent attacks have been traced to Iran, official says .

"Just when you thought the heat couldn't get any worse, it looks like it will. On Friday afternoon, temperatures topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit from Chicago to Kansas City, Missouri, and Columbus, Ohio, and many places in between. Heat watches, warnings and advisories touched 25 states -- an area spanning roughly one-quarter of the nation and encompassing more than 115 million people, or more than one in three Americans. Around 4 p.m., the thermometer in St. Louis read 105 degrees, the ninth straight day it has topped the century mark in that Missouri city. That may sound bad, but it's relatively cool compared with the 110 degrees the National Weather Service is forecasting for Saturday. Triple-digit strategies for staying healthy . St. Louis won't be alone in going from unbelievably hot to unbearably hot. New York should hit 100 degrees Saturday, as should Lexington, Kentucky. And in Washington, D.C., the thermometer is expected to reach 103 degrees, and the heat index will make it feel like 113. ""The record-breaking heat wave currently affecting parts of the central and eastern U.S. will continue into the weekend,"" the weather service said dryly. About 350,000 customers across 12 states and the District of Columbia will be suffering in this heat without the benefits of electricity, including power for their air conditioning and for refrigeration to keep their food edible, according to a CNN count from Friday night. Because utilities typically define each residential and business account as a customer, the actual number of people affected was not clear. Many of these people have gone without power for a full week, thanks to strong storms fueled by the heat that barreled east from Indiana to New Jersey. Others have watched more recent but similar storms leave them in the dark. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage .

In Washington, the thermometer has gone past 95 degrees for nine straight days -- the longest such streak since modern record-keeping began. The high temperatures have been linked to a number of deaths nationwide. That includes five deaths -- of men ages 48, 58 and 59 and two women ages 81 and 91 -- because of ""heat stress"" in Chicago, city public health spokesman Efrat Stein said Friday. Another heat-related death was reported in nearby Cook County, according to Stein. Another three heat-related deaths were reported in Rock County, Wisconsin, according to Chief Deputy Coroner Louis Smit. Heat was ruled an ""exacerbating factor"" in two of those cases, and it was a ""major factor"" in the death of an 83-year-old woman found dead ""from a cardiac-related condition"" in a home that was 95 degrees inside and had ""no cold water or other fluids.""

"Behind a Victorian shop front in the Cockney heartland of London's East End hides an urban agriculture initiative that claims to be the world's first farm in a shop. The aptly-named FARM:shop sits along a busy main road next to a ragtag bunch of more conventional retail outlets, most of which are in various phases of decay. There are chickens grazing on the rooftop -- seemingly oblivious to the red double decker buses roaring past below. Inside are fish tanks filled with Tilapia; mushrooms sprouting in the basement; fruit blooming in a polytunnel greenhouse; and endless rows of herbs and salad leaves growing from the hydroponic troughs that line the shelves. ""I think places like FARM:shop can reconnect people with their food,"" says engineer and co-founder Paul Smyth.  ""We've had this separation of countryside and city living ... So the connection has been severed between what you eat and how it's grown."" While the ethos is community focused, the shop's interior is more like a laboratory than a local gardening center.  White low-energy strip lights facilitate the growth of vegetables in lieu of sun rays, and the cabbage patch looks more like a cluster of giant Petri dishes than an allotment. ""We've been learning as we go with most of this technology,"" admits Smyth. That said, the shop -- which opened in 2011 -- is already a modest commercial success. Having diversified into a grocery store, cafe, rentable office and events space, it now employs two staff and is turning a profit -- all of which is ploughed back into the business. ""We've experienced a great amount of goodwill and enthusiasm about the project. People just want to come off the street, learn how to raise a fish; look after a chicken; grow some food -- and that means you get a more people-powered agriculture,"" says Smyth. Infographic: The secret life of drinking water . While few would contest the rehabilitative social value of projects like FARM:shop, its founders argue it could be the start of something much more: A radical new approach to ecologically sustainable agriculture. ""If you're growing food directly where it's eaten, there's less refrigeration ... less energy use through transport and distribution,"" claims Smyth. He says FARM:shop could be scaled up and replicated in cities around the world to help reduce the enormous carbon emissions linked to food production. It's a pressing issue. According to a 2008 Greenpeace report, the food industry is responsible for creating 30% of the world's total annual carbon emissions. ""The dominant food production system is based on fossil fuel at every level,"" says Dr Martin Caraher, Professor of Food and Health Policy at London's City University. ""It needs oil to make the fertilizer; oil for the farm; oil for the food processing; oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops,"" he adds. Among these stages, transport, processing and packaging account for the lion's share of pollutants. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that between 65% to 85% of food-related emissions in the Western hemisphere is created once produce has left the farm. ""This is why these type of projects are much more than feel-good gimmicks, they are absolutely vital as part of a diverse array of sustainable agriculture systems that we must pursue further,"" says Olivier de Schutter, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on the right to food. For De Schutter, the fact that food is often produced thousands of miles away from where most people live represents an irrational system, both from an ecologic and economic perspective. ""Rising fuel prices and the increasing concentration of the population in urban areas is bringing about serious logistical problems for the delivery of food,"" he says. ""Traffic congestion, high refrigeration costs and, after all that, poor quality produce."" Food destined for the UK alone travels 30 billion kilometers a year -- adding 19 million tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere -- according to international development agency Practical Action. It's also easy to overlook the damage inflicted on local ecosystems and economies -- a large portion of which are in the developing world -- as a consequence of current industrial-scale agriculture practices. ""The system is not working,"" says Florence Egal, chairman of the Food for Cities network. ""Big agribusiness disrupts natural resource management with its demand for monoculture crops, synthetic packaging and habitat contamination from factory waste."" Read related: Farm in the city could be supermarket of the future . Both Egal and de Schutter agree that, even on a vastly escalated scale, initiatives like FARM:shop are unlikely to resolve the food sustainability issue by themselves. ""Right now, no-one is saying you're going to feed nine billion people like this,"" says Egal. ""But agriculture reform is an incremental process requiring many solutions -- and growing perishable, fresh produce near to where it's consumed seems like one very sensible step."" Back in east London, Smyth is optimistic about the future. ""FARM:shop itself is experimental, it will always be our laboratory at the heart of our ideas. But going forward we'll be looking at bigger sites, scaling up, growing more food and selling more food together -- and if we get those kind of sites we're really confident we can roll this out and make a real lasting difference.""","London urban farming project claims to be world's first ever farm in a shop .

"(CNN)Members of New Ways Ministry -- an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered Catholics -- have made three pilgrimages to the Vatican, under three different popes. But only once have they been treated like VIPs. That's the treatment the roughly 50 members of the Maryland-based group got -- much to their surprise -- for Pope Francis' weekly address Wednesday in St. Peter's Square, according to Francis DeBernardo, the group's executive director. ""It's really an incredible honor and an incredible step forward for the LGBT community to be recognized,"" he told CNN from Rome. DeBernardo would still like to see more changes from the Catholic hierarchy and the Pontiff, like shifts in their official positions in support of same-sex marriage and adoption of children by gay and lesbian couples. And even Wednesday, New Ways Ministry was recognized simply as a lay group of Catholics, not one that speaks for the LGBT community. The Vatican didn't grant members' request for a special private audience with Francis, nor did anyone acknowledge their calling out to him that ""we are gay and lesbian Catholics,"" DeBernardo said. Still, the fact that they were recognized at all was a positive for the New Ways Ministry leader. So, too, was their special seating Wednesday -- on the same level as the Pope, something they didn't know about until they got their tickets (which were arranged by Vatican officials) on Tuesday night. This experience was much different for New Ways Ministry, which has been around for 38 years, than its earlier Vatican visits when Benedict XVI and John Paul II were in office. ""We were basically ignored by them,"" DeBernardo said. ""So not just to be acknowledged, but to be acknowledged in such an honorable way, is (good)."" Not much about the Roman Catholic church's official stances on LGBT issues has changed since Argentinian Bishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope in March 2013. But there has been a noticeable shift in tone. This became evident a few months after Francis' election, when he was asked during a wide-ranging news conference about his stance on gays and lesbians, including gay priests. ""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" the Pope said. A few months later, Francis said church officials have the right to express opinions but not to ""interfere spiritually"" in the lives of gays and lesbians. This reflected his larger push to make the church more welcoming and open, and less focused on sometimes divisive social issues. Speaking about this shift, DeBernardo said Francis ""has given people a lot of hope, (though) I don't think he's a pope that's going to make the big changes that we'd like to see."" ""But,"" DeBernardo added, ""he is a pope who is opening up a discussion.""","A U.S.-based ministry for LGBT Catholics attends Pope Francis' weekly address .

"Washington (CNN)The Senate cleared its first procedural hurdle in an effort to green-light the Keystone XL pipeline on Monday -- but the project's advocates will still need a few more votes if they are to overcome President Barack Obama's expected veto. The Senate voted 63 to 32 to take up the bill, which would end the State Department's six-year review of the 1,179-mile Canada-to-Texas pipeline and authorize its construction. White House threatens vetoes on eve of meeting with lawmakers . Ten Democrats and one independent joined all of the chamber's Republicans in backing the bill -- suggesting there are enough votes to approve it, a major milestone for a bill that had cleared the House but stalled in the Senate in previous years. Its passage is a goal for new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, who has made it the first bill the now Republican-controlled chamber has taken up. But the pipeline's supporters will need 67 votes -- a two-thirds majority -- to override an Obama veto. The President has said he would like the decision left in the hands of the executive branch, rather than handed over to Congress. The push to build the pipeline got a boost Friday when the Nebraska Supreme Court OK'ed its route through the state, removing a legal case that the Obama administration had said it wanted to see play out before issuing a decision. The Senate is likely to consider amendments to the bill this week and next week, with a final vote coming sometime around Obama's State of the Union speech. The Keystone bill's sponsor, Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, told ""Fox News Sunday"" this weekend that he hopes the amendment process will attract more Democratic supporters to the bill. ""Right now we've got about 63 [votes],"" Hoeven said. ""But we're going to the floor with an open amendment process, trying to foster more bipartisanship ... so that we can pass this measure and other measures and either override the veto or attach the bill to other legislation that will get 67 votes."" One Democrat said on the program that he doesn't expect that to happen. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said, ""It's clear that there will not be a veto override.""","The Senate voted 63-32 on Monday to advance a bill that authorizes construction of the Keystone XL pipeline .

"Another tense standoff developed Monday night in Ferguson, Missouri, which has seen nightly protests since unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death by a white police officer. The renewed tensions came after the preliminary results of an autopsy that Brown's family requested were released, as was a new account of what allegedly happened in the moments immediately before the teenager was killed by a local police officer. Evidence in the shooting death could be presented to a grand jury as early as Wednesday. And as the situation in the St. Louis suburb was being watched and talked about across the country, it continued to draw comments from numerous quarters -- including the White House. ""We have all seen images of protesters and law enforcement in the streets. It's clear that the vast majority of people are peacefully protesting. What's also clear is that a small minority of individuals are not,"" said President Barack Obama. ""While I understand the passions and the anger that arise over the death of Michael Brown, giving into that anger by looting, or carrying guns, and even attacking the police only serves to raise tensions and stir chaos,"" he said, in a call for calm. ""Let's see some understanding"" rather than confrontation, and ""let's seek to heal,"" the President said. The protests in Ferguson also prompted Gov. Jay Nixon to call out the National Guard. Officials temporarily detained several people, including news photographer Scott Olson and longtime activist and Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein. Dueling narratives . The officer who killed Brown says the teenager rushed at him full speed in the moments before the shooting, according to an account phoned in to a St. Louis radio station and confirmed by a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation. According to the version on KFTK, phoned in by a woman who identified herself as ""Josie,"" the altercation on August 9 began after Officer Darren Wilson rolled down his window to tell Brown and a friend to stop walking in the street. When Wilson tried to get out of his cruiser, Brown first tried to push the officer back into the car, then punched him in the face and grabbed for his gun before breaking free after the gun went off once, the caller said. Wilson pursued Brown and his friend, ordering them to freeze, according to the account. When they turned around, Brown began taunting Wilson, saying he would not arrest them, then ran at the officer at full speed, the caller said. Wilson then began shooting. The final shot was to Brown's forehead, and the teenager fell two or three feet in front of Wilson, said the caller, who identified herself as the officer's friend. A source with detailed knowledge of the investigation later told CNN the caller's account is ""accurate,"" in that it matches what Wilson has told investigators. But accounts of exactly what happened when Wilson stopped Brown vary widely. Witnesses said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at the police car before the young man was shot.  Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer. Piaget Crenshaw said she was sitting in her home when she witnessed the shooting. She captured video of the aftermath, including images of Brown's body lying in the middle of the street. Crenshaw said Brown was running away from police and then turned around. She said that was when Brown was shot. Police provided a different narrative, saying Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon. Parallel investigations . A grand jury will hear testimony from witnesses and decide on whether to return an indictment in the case, Ed McGee, spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, said Monday, stressing there is ""no time line on this case."" In addition to that proceeding, the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Brown's death. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Ferguson this week, to meet with investigators there. ""I realize there is tremendous interest in the facts of the incident that led to Michael Brown's death, but I ask for the public's patience as we conduct this investigation,"" the attorney general said in a statement. ""The selective release of sensitive information that we have seen in this case so far is troubling to me. No matter how others pursue their own separate inquiries, the Justice Department is resolved to preserve the integrity of its investigation."" Autopsy findings . An autopsy conducted for the family of Brown found no evidence that he struggled with Wilson before his death, according to the pathologist in charge of the examination. Dr. Michael Baden conducted the autopsy after an official examination by the St. Louis County medical examiner's office. Forensics consultant Shawn Parcells, who assisted Baden, said the findings are consistent with witness reports that Brown may have been shot as he walked away and that he was shot again with his hands up. The family autopsy found that Brown was shot at least six times, including two shots to his head. Three of the bullets may have re-entered his body, causing additional damage, Baden said. One of the bullets entered his head and came out through his eye; another -- likely the fatal wound, Baden said -- struck Brown on the top of his head and caused irreparable damage to his brain. Family attorney Benjamin Crump said Brown probably would have been either kneeling or bending forward when he was struck with those bullets. Brown had abrasions on his face consistent with falling onto the ground, Baden said. He cautioned that he needs access to autopsy results, including tests on Brown's clothes and X-rays, before making some conclusions. But Crump said the autopsy already offered more than ""ample"" evidence to support Wilson's arrest. ""What does this autopsy say? That the witness accounts were true, that he was shot multiple times,"" Crump told reporters. Attorney General Holder said a third autopsy was being conducted Monday by medical examiners from the U.S. military. Michael Brown death: Autopsy unlikely to settle dueling narratives . Devolution of protests . Another family attorney, Anthony Gray, implored protesters to remain peaceful. ""I can see that there is a very disturbing divide that is developing in our community,"" he said Monday. ""This is not what we initially came to the community and called for."" The situation remains so unstable that the Ferguson-Florissant School District has canceled classes for the rest of the week. The Missouri National Guard was in Ferguson under orders from the governor to restore peace. Nixon issued the order early Monday after what began as peaceful protests spiraled into disarray after two civilians were shot and injured, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. He said those civilians were not shot by police. Some protesters hurled Molotov cocktails at police, and several businesses were vandalized or looted despite the Brown family's call for calm. ""Based on these conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of our response,"" Johnson said. Officers fired tear gas into hundreds of protesters, including children, who were marching toward a police command post despite an impending midnight curfew. Two children were treated and released for exposure to tear gas overnight at St. Louis Children's Hospital, according to a spokeswoman there. Protester Lisha Williams challenged the notion that protesters provoked officers. ""That is a lie. It was no fight, it was no shots fired,"" she told CNN late Sunday. ""All we did was march to the command center to fall to our knees and say, 'Don't shoot.' And they started shooting."" 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting .

""Its 'super-fast' internet that is said to allow passengers to stream video, Skype and download emails simultaneously at speeds they would on shore, did not work as smoothly as it should have,"" says a report on the UK's Daily Telegraph about the ship's brief Southampton visit. ""Royal Caribbean was also not having much luck with the two robots at the Bionic Bar,"" says the report. ""The robotic arms failed to stand glasses upright on a number of occasions. Cocktails are meant to be mixed in one minute but as waiting times rose to 20 minutes the IT team pulled the plug -- literally -- and went back to the drawing board."" However, the report suggested these issues will likely be resolved by the time the cruise docks in New York on November 10, blaming the patchy WiFi on the fact service provider O3b Networks does not yet have a satellite covering the UK. Once the trans-Atlantic cruise is complete, Quantum will spend the winter cruising the eastern Caribbean, with trips departing from New Jersey. From next June, the mega-ship will operate year-round out of Shanghai. Sister-ship Anthem of the Seas will debut in Southampton in April 2015 and sail Mediterranean itineraries. Construction on the third Quantum class ship, Ovation of the Seas, started in September and is due to be delivered in the fall of 2016, says the company. According to Cruisecritic.com, the Quantum Class of ships represents a significant reduction in size compared with Royal Caribbean's Oasis Class ships, which measure 225,282 tons and carry 5,400 passengers at double occupancy.","Royal Caribbean says Quantum of the Seas is the world's most technologically advanced cruise ship .

"Wu Yuanhong, a man suffering from schizophrenia in China's southeastern Jiangxi Province, was forced by his mother to live in a small metal cage for 11 years after he beat a young boy to death. Reports of Wu's dire situation surfaced in Chinese media last May, accompanied by images of the 42-year old sitting in the cage in his underwear, his feet shackled by a heavy chain. Cases similar to Wu are not unheard of in China. Work pressure, the breakdown of traditional family structures, and other aspects of China's rapid modernization have brought an increase in psychological stress to the population. There are often reports of violent, random attacks, killings and suicides. One of the most memorable was when a depressed 27-year-old factory worker tried to feed himself to a pair of Bengal tigers at a Chengdu zoo by jumping into their cage last February. Not enough help . The country's public health system is struggling to keep up with the demand in mental health care. Around 173 million Chinese suffer from a mental disorder, according to a 2009 study published in British medical journal The Lancet. But there are only 20,000 psychiatrists, equaling 1.5 for each 100,000 people, or a tenth of the ratio in the United States. Professor Michael Phillips, director of the Shanghai Mental Health Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, estimated that only 5% of people who currently have a mental illness in China have received psychiatric care from a professional. ""The factors that affect the low care-seeking rates are many,"" he said. ""Lack of awareness that they suffer from a psychiatric condition, lack of locally available mental health services, fear of stigma, belief that seeking psychological help will be useless, costs, etcetera."" Dubious therapy . As a response to the massive demand for help with mental health problems, under-qualified mental health practitioners have sprung up across the country. Dr. Sammy Cheng Kin-wing, Hong Kong-based chairman of the Division of Clinical Psychology, part of the Hong Kong Psychological Society, said he receives many complaints from the public. Commonly complaints are about unregistered psychologists who give unprofessional advice to clients, fail to provide proper assessments and break confidentiality. ""Many people are setting up practices in mainland China. Some are well-trained, but that's just a minority. Because the need is so great, the unqualified can still run their businesses and offer treatment. I've been in contact with patients who feel very angry over services received, sometimes with emotional state worsened during treatment. They said they would never see a psychologist again,"" said Cheng. Professor Phillips agreed that ""charlatans occur everywhere"" and ""there are uneducated subgroups in China that are gullible."" ""In terms of professional services there are certainly locations with sub-standard levels of care, primarily because of a lack of trained personnel,"" he added. 'Ankang' Ironically, while those in genuine need of help have been unable to get any, the government has used confinement in mental institutions as a way to silence political dissenters, human rights activists claim. Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Hong Kong, said it's a method that has been used increasingly over the past decade, calling it ""an absolute violation of medical ethics."" One of those alleged to have been a victim of the practice, is Xing Shiku. Chinese Human Rights Defenders say he has been incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital in Heilongjiang Province for more than six years. Xing, they say, had been filing complaints to the central government about corruption and other problems related to the privatization of the state-owned company where he worked. These mental institutions are called ""ankang"" (""peace and health"") hospitals and are managed by the Public Security Bureau. Treatments include beatings and electric shocks, according to HRW. As of 2011, there were some 20 ""ankang"" institutions operating in China. Although China's National Health and Family Planning Commission did not directly respond to the allegations, they stated that ""China's mental health organizations strictly follow laws when practicing diagnosis and treatment."" They added that diagnoses of mental disorders are made according to the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases. Baby steps . The government has taken steps to address the shallow mental health system, such as financing mental health services and provide training for primary care providers. Most notably, a new mental health law was introduced last year -- it took 27 years to pass the legislation. Among the most significant changes was a new set of rights for patients, including not being hospitalized against their will. Despite constructive changes, HRW argues that there are still plenty of loopholes. ""The very first test of the mental health law will be whether those held in psychiatric facilities for political reasons are immediately released,"" the organization's China director, Sophie Richardson, said in a statement. The new law is a big step in the right direction, most commentators say. But a voluntary admissions system will further increase the need for more mental health practitioners and community-based services, potentially sending a system already in disarray into further decline. While a wholesale reform of the mental health system is needed, one expert says no number of laws and certifications can help therapists gain the most important skill of all: a nuanced understanding of human emotion. Harry Hoffmann and his wife Tina, a psychological counselor, run Da Wen, a counseling and coaching private practice in Kunming, Yunnan Province. Part of their business is to train those who wish to become therapists themselves. ""I met a man from Chengdu with a master degree in psychology who said 'I have learned nothing about inner feelings and emotions (from school). Can you help me to gain those skills?'"" said Hoffmann. ""For me, therapy is almost like art, with a set of ethical guidelines and a holistic health approach.""

"(CNN)So much for a short Republican primary season. The shadow campaign is already in full swing as Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush openly consider presidential runs that would tap many of the same political and financial resources. Romney told donors Friday he's considering a third presidential run while Bush is forming a political action committee to use as a possible vessel for a presidential effort. The former Florida governor is also in California this week meeting with donors, according to two sources familiar with his plans. There will be even more 2016 speculation later this month when a handful of possible candidates attend a gathering in Iowa. And all of this is happening more than a year before any Republican actually casts a ballot. These early developments could hamper the Republican Party's efforts to keep the primary season brief and orderly after 2012's marathon campaign, which included 20 debates and nearly 10 candidates. That prolonged primary provided ample ammunition to Democrats. After the failed Republican campaign to topple President Barack Obama in 2012, the Republican National Committee concluded that the primary season needed to be contained and shortened. The RNC went on to adopt changes to the primary calendar at the party's Winter meeting in 2014, where they shrunk the official primary season by pushing the first contest back to February 2016 and holding the party convention in early June. The decision will require all states to choose delegates within a contracted window, as opposed to the drawn-out eight months in the last cycle. The party is also moving toward limiting the number of debates and taking more control over choosing moderators for the events. The decision was made in part to limit the chance of public, embarrassing episodes over a long and exhausting campaign period. That decision is expected to be formalized at the RNC's meeting in San Diego this week. Debates are expected to begin near the end of the summer, and the party is aiming to hold about 10 sanctioned contests, an RNC committee member said. RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski told CNN that candidates are free to start their campaigns as early as they want, but with the knowledge that the electoral contests won't begin until February 2016 at the earliest. In 2012, the Iowa caucuses were held on Jan. 3, and others followed almost immediately after. ""We're doing what we can to contract the process, while allowing the primary voters to make their decisions and see the candidates they need to see,"" Kukowski said. ""It's up to the campaigns to decide if it makes sense strategically to be running a campaign a year before ballots are going to be out on money, staff and infrastructure."" Regardless, it doesn't appear that the possible candidates are taking their time. On Jan. 6, Bush rolled out a leadership PAC called ""Right to Rise,"" which effectively served as the starting gun for the GOP primary contest. Just three days later, Romney told donors gathered in New York that he may run despite habitually denying his ambition after the 2012 race. This week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is scheduled to hold donor meetings in New York as well. And with more than a year to go before the first Iowa caucus meetings, potential candidates are already putting their teams together for the long slog and signing on for pre-primary cattlecalls. On Jan. 24, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King will co-host the inaugural ""Iowa Freedom Summit"" with the advocacy group Citizens United. So far, nearly every  2016 hopeful has accepted the invitations to speak, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Bush, however, declined. Republicans say that despite the early movements, the party can still fulfill the goals of truncating the official calendar. ""I think we're still better off than we were, even if these guys stretch out the donor process in the front end,"" Republican strategist Rick Wilson told CNN. ""For all the early chatter, most of it is political class stuff, not about voter attention."" CNN's Maeve Reston contributed to this report .","GOP has tried to cut down length of primaries .
But early action by Jeb Bush, Mitt Romeny could blunt those efforts ."
"From futuristic Google Glass headsets to smart watches like Samsung's Galaxy Gear, wearable gadgets are billed as the next big thing in technology. But China's tech counterfeiters -- notorious for having a nose for what's hot and what's not -- appear for now at least to be giving wearable technology the cold shoulder in what one expert calls a ""serious warning signal"" for market players. CNN reporters approached wholesale companies and retailers at one of China's biggest electronics trading districts to learn how the ""knock-off"" business works. ""There are no copies for sale. Only originals,"" said the managing director of wholesale company that specializes in mobile electronic devices in Shenzhen, a factory town in China's southern Pearl River Delta region. ""Maybe we'll have them (fakes) in a few months. I don't know, interest is low."" China's thriving market for counterfeit electronic goods has been a headache for global hi-tech firms including Apple, HTC and Samsung, as illegal cut-price copies of much sought after products eat into their profits. But, one might argue, if there is one thing worse than being copied, that is to be ignored. And that seems to be the case with Samsung's new Galaxy Gear smart watch -- one of the first wearable devices to be made commercially available and as such an indicator for the emerging category. A visit to the shops of Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei commercial district -- a tightly packed group of malls surrounded by high rises that form the epicenter of China's trade in electronic knock-offs -- suggests demand for Samsung's smart watch is ice-cold. ""You won't find any copies of the smart watch here. I've never seen or heard of any,"" said a young man who was busy shipping off boxes, that he said were filled with counterfeit mobile phones, at a local logistics center. ""Thinking about it, I've never even seen anyone wear one,"" he added. The launch of Samsung's Gear seemed like something of a victory against its big rival Apple, which is rumored to be launching its iWatch sometime this year, but the device was conspicuous by its absence in Huaqiangbei's market halls, logistic companies and workshops. ""I've never seen a knock-off Gear in this whole town,"" said a young woman working in a shop full of Samsung products. Her shop is one of the few outlets that sell the real Gear but she said ""they don't sell well."" ""[Counterfeiters] don't care about the Gear as consumer demand is too weak,"" said another shop assistant in his early twenties, who was selling a number of what he said were real Samsung products, but not the smart watch. ""We don't sell it anymore. It was not popular."" Priced at around $300, Chinese consumers find Samsung's new gadget too expensive, he added. Out of 20 shops visited by CNN, not one sold fake Samsung Gear smart watches and none could offer leads on where to find copies. All these 20 shops sold the smart watch, out of hundreds perhaps thousands, of market booths that didn't sell Samsung's Gear. However, many of the same shops openly promoted copies of Apple's latest iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy Note III -- models also launched in September -- suggesting the counterfeiters are quick to copy if they see market potential. Warning signal . The lack of copy versions of the Gear is a ""serious warning signal,"" according to Alf Rehn, a management professor at the Åbo Akademi University in Finland, who has spent years studying the global piracy phenomena. ""Piracy is all about benefiting from buzz -- create something good enough that looks like the real deal, and make money off those who are not willing or able to pay for the authentic item but who still want to be 'with it.' ""Without the buzz, there's no need for the counterfeit, and it seems like Samsung's smart watch hasn't quite gotten the buzz going. ""This doesn't mean that the Galaxy smart watch is a complete bust, rather that it primarily speaks to a small group of gadget enthusiasts who will pay to get the real deal, rather than to the mass market. ""So this isn't necessarily a disaster for Samsung, but definitively a serious warning signal as the Shenzhen crowd is the bellwether for electronics consumption."" It's not uncommon for top-selling products to be on the market before launch of the original; there were pirated iPhone-lookalikes on the market months before the first iPhone launched, Rehn added. Likewise, unpopular products are unceremoniously dropped by pirates who simply cannot afford to get stuck with the inventory; there are stories about how new Nokia models basically were discontinued by counterfeiters before the genuine article even made it to market, according to Rehn. ""This is a warp-speed market economy, where every product faces an 'up or out' decision on a daily basis. Competition is brutal,"" he added. In an email to CNN, Samsung said that Galaxy Gear received ""positive consumer feedback globally"" and that 800,000 units were sold in the first two months after its release. However, Samsung's head of Open Innovation Center, David Eun, told a conference in November that the Gear is still a ""small green tomato"" that has not yet matured into something special. China's pirate community seems to agree.","Wearable gadgets like smart watches are billed as the next big thing in technology .

"President Barack Obama, responding to concerns over the use of military-style equipment during protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the summer, is asking aides to prepare an executive order that would better track the weapons and gear flowing from the federal government to local police departments around the nation. The order, which he's expected to preview Monday afternoon during a meeting with law enforcement and local government officials, would mandate federal agencies review the way they provide U.S. police with heavy equipment like tanks and aircraft. A report issued by the White House found the vast majority of material coming from the Department of Defense to police departments wasn't military-style: it included office supplies, furniture and tents. But 4% of the Pentagon's output to police departments is military grade, including 92,442 small arms, 5,235 Humvees, 617 mine resistant vehicles and 616 aircraft. Other agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, also provide police with equipment and funds. The executive action, which was described by White House officials ahead of Obama's announcement, is the conclusion of a review process Obama launched in August following the heavily armed response to protesters in Ferguson. Images of tear-gassed filled streets patrolled by police in tanks sparked concern that local departments were treating citizens like enemy combatants. Officials said following the reviews, agencies could require better tracking of the equipment that ends up with police, require training for officers, and mandate reviews following ""significant"" incidents in which the equipment is used. But officials said the president wouldn't tamp down on the flow of equipment from the Pentagon to police departments since the bulk of the gear isn't military grade. Instead, they said Obama would convene a task force on policing, focused on combating crime while building public trust in local law enforcement agencies. Charles Ramsey, the police commissioner of Philadelphia, will head the panel. The White House will also ask for $263 million to provide police departments with body cameras, which advocates say would provide a clearer picture of confrontations like the incident in Ferguson, in which a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager. The funds would also go toward training. As White House tackles Ferguson tensions, what solutions will it find?","Obama is planning an executive order on police militarization .

"(CNN)The makers of Cadbury Creme Eggs are walking on eggshells with fans of the beloved Easter treat after a recent tweak in the recipe. The chocolate eggs, filled with a cloying ""yolk"" of yellow and white fondant, were originally made in the United Kingdom with Cadbury's signature Dairy Milk chocolate. Now, under the new recipe, they're made with ""a standard, traditional Cadbury milk chocolate,"" said a spokeswoman for Mondelez International, a spinoff of Kraft Foods, in a statement. Kraft acquired British candy maker Cadbury in 2010 for roughly $19 billion. The change applies only to Cadbury eggs sold in the United Kingdom. The goo-filled eggs usually appear on shelves starting in January until April. ""We have always used a range of milk chocolate blends for different products, depending on their shape or consistency,"" the spokeswoman said. ""The fundamentals of the Cadbury Crème Egg remain exactly the same -- delicious milk chocolate and the unique creme centre that consumers love."" However, fans aren't buying it. Some took to Twitter to vent their displeasure. According to Cadbury, 500 million creme eggs are made each year, and about two-thirds of those are consumed in the UK. This is not Cadbury's first controversy of 2015's creme-egg season: Fans expressed similar disappointment when the number of eggs in each pack was cut from six to five.","Fans of Cadbury Creme Eggs are upset about a recipe change .

"(CNN)At least 59 people were killed late Saturday in a fiery collision between a bus and an oil tanker near the southern port city of Karachi in Pakistan. The bus, which was overcrowded, was reportedly hit head-on by the tanker. The driver of the tanker, which police say was traveling in the wrong direction on a dilapidated stretch of highway, reportedly fled the scene. Police are investigating whether the tanker was solely at fault, or whether the bus driver also bore some responsibility. Shoaib Siddiqui, Commissioner of Karachi, told CNN that initial investigations suggest that the road condition was bad, and the oil tanker was traveling the wrong way on the national highway. Most of the bus passengers died in the incident. Some passengers traveling on the roof of the vehicle managed to jump to safety, but those inside were trapped. Along with the deaths, several people suffered serious burns. Gul Hassan said he was at work when the news came in. Nine members of his family perished in the accident, including the family's 80-year-old patriarch and two children. ""I am not able to recognize a single person as my family member -- that is how badly the bodies are burnt,"" he told CNN. Karachi's Jinnah Hospital has received 57 bodies, Semi Jamali, a doctor at the hospital, told CNN. All are burnt beyond recognition, she said, suggesting that authorities would have to resort to DNA testing to ascertain the victims' identities. Traffic accidents are a major cause of death in Pakistan, with WHO data from 2013 suggesting that the death rate from road accidents was 17.4 per 100,000 of population. The incident bore a striking resemblance to a previous bus crash in southeastern Pakistan last year, which killed a similar number of passengers.

"U.S. agents disrupted an Iranian assassination-for-hire scheme targeting Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, U.S. officials said Tuesday. Elements of the Iranian government directed the alleged plan, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said. A naturalized U.S. citizen holding Iranian and U.S. passports and a member of Iran's Revolutionary Guard face conspiracy charges connected with the plot. ""In addition to holding these individual conspirators accountable for their alleged role in this plot, the United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for its actions,"" Holder said. A spokesman for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad described the accusations as a ""fabrication"" by U.S. authorities attempting to distract American citizens. ""They want to take the public's mind off the serious domestic problems they're facing these days and scare them with fabricated problems outside the country,"" spokesman Ali Akbar Javanfekr said. The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington thanked U.S. authorities for stepping in. ""The attempted plot is a despicable violation of international norms, standards and conventions and is not in accord with the principles of humanity,"" the embassy said in a written statement. The Saudi ambassador was not the only intended target, U.S. officials said. The suspects also discussed attacking Israeli and Saudi embassies in Washington and possibly Buenos Aires, Argentina, a senior U.S. official said. It is unclear why the Saudi ambassador was targeted, the official said, or how widespread knowledge or approval of the plot was within Ahmadinejad's government. U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, later said he was confident the plan was sanctioned by top Iranian officials. ""The quickness of the decisions that were made in order for certain elements of this to fall into place tells us that it is clearly tied to the highest levels of the Iranian government,"" he said. Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are accused of conspiracy to murder a foreign official, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism, the FBI said. Arbabsiar was arrested in September. Shakuri remains at large, the bureau said. The two were in a group that began planning this spring to kill Saudi Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir, it said. Authorities developed the case against them with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a Mexican drug cartel, according to officials and an FBI agent's affidavit released Tuesday. Read the federal complaint (PDF) Arbabsiar and the undercover informant allegedly discussed using explosives to kill the ambassador and possibly attacking a crowded restaurant, according to the affidavit. The informant named $1.5 million as his price, it said. Arbabsiar allegedly sent $100,000 intended as a down payment, telling the informant his ""cousin"" had deep pockets, court documents said. ""This is politics, OK? ... It's not like, eh, personal,"" Arbabsiar told the informant in a secretly recorded meeting in Mexico on July 17, the affidavit alleges. According to the affidavit, Arbabsiar said his cousin had ""the government behind him. ... He's not paying from his pocket."" The alleged scheme involved the Quds Force, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard that is suspected of being involved in a number of foreign operations, court documents and U.S. officials said. The Quds Force connection . U.S. officials accuse the Quds Force of sponsoring attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, the affidavit released Tuesday said. In October 2007, the Treasury Department designated it as ""providing material to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations."" Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations, said Tuesday night that he was ""shocked to hear such a big lie,"" claiming the chain of events outlined by U.S. authorities was an ""insult to the common sense"" of people everywhere. In a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday night, Khazaee decried the United States' ""warmongering and propaganda machine against Iran,"" which he said threatened stability and peace in the Persian Gulf. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly and categorically rejects these fabricated and baseless allegations, based on the suspicious claims by an individual,"" he wrote. The alleged plot read ""like the pages of a Hollywood script,"" but the implications were real, FBI Director Robert Mueller said. ""This case illustrates that we live in a world where borders and boundaries are increasingly irrelevant -- a world where individuals from one country sought to conspire with a drug-trafficking cartel in another country to assassinate a foreign official on United States soil,"" he said. Cooperation with the Mexican government played a key role in the investigation, U.S. officials said. U.S. authorities arranged with Mexican officials for Arbabsiar to be denied entry into Mexico, a senior counterterrorism official said. From there, he was placed on an airplane to New York, where U.S. agents interrogated him for 12 days, obtained a confession and compiled dozens of intelligence reports, the official said. Investigators have directly linked the plot to Iran's elite Quds Force but have not directly linked it with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the senior counterterrorism official said. But even as authorities worked to determine how widespread the Iranian government's involvement was, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that additional actions to further isolate the Iranian regime would be considered. Senior Obama administration officials emphasized that the United States would pursue non-military responses. A U.S. official said Tuesday that the United States will be taking up the issue with the U.N. Security Council and other members of the international community, the official said. How should the U.S. respond? Shortly after U.S. authorities released details of the accusations Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions targeting Arbabsiar, Shakuri and three others tied to the alleged plot. Often considered regional rivals, the oil-rich Saudi kingdom has long been at odds with Iran. Iran and Saudi Arabia's rocky relations . The country's Sunni leaders have at times discussed directly intervening in Iraq following the U.S. military withdrawal, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report. Iran has largely supported Shiite militias in Iraq. A spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry said Tuesday's U.S. allegations were baseless, noting that Iran's relations with Saudi Arabia are ""based on mutual respect,"" the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. ""Making such false allegations will not get anywhere and will not influence public opinion,"" said spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast, according to Mehr. But Saudi security forces are now concerned that Iran may try to stir unrest during the upcoming hajj pilgrimage season in Saudi Arabia, said a senior Saudi adviser not authorized to speak to the media. ""We are on our toes. We expect the worst and we think Iranians are capable of using any person from any country to stir trouble during hajj season,"" the Saudi adviser said.","Iranian U.N. envoy: Iran ""categorically rejects these fabricated and baseless allegations""

"Hong Kong (CNN)Assailants hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of one of Hong Kong's largest media companies, Next Media and at the residence of its founder and former chairman, media tycoon Jimmy Lai in the early hours on Monday morning. Security footage from Lai's residence show a private vehicle pull up outside his house at 1:30 a.m. In the footage, a masked man emerges from the car seconds after, ignites an object and hurls it at the front gates before driving away. Minutes later, similar devices were thrown at Next Media's headquarters in another part of the city. Police told CNN that both cases are currently undergoing investigation, and no arrests have been made. Two vehicles suspected to have been used in the attacks were found torched, with license plates removed, reported the South China Morning Post. Lai's assistant said that this was not the first time the media mogul's private residences had been targeted. ""We're not shocked. Unfortunately, violence has become a regular feature of Hong Kong now in the political discourse. That's just a simple fact,"" Mark Simon, Lai's assistant, told CNN. Next Media and its founder, who retains a majority -- 73% -- stake in the company, are known to be critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, and have been targeted in several attacks. In 2013, a stolen car crashed into the front gates of Lai's residence, and a machete and an ax were left in his driveway. A week after the attack, two masked men set fire to bundles of the Apple Daily newspaper, a Next Media publication, in an intercepted delivery van, according to the Guardian, a British newspaper. For several days in mid-October, a group of protestors blocked the entrance of a printing plant that published Apple Daily, in attempt to prevent the pro-democracy newspaper from reaching newsstands. Lai, a fervent China critic and staunch supporter of the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, resigned as chairman of Next Media shortly after the protests sites were cleared in December.","A Hong Kong media HQ and the residence of its founder, tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying were attacked Monday morning .

"(CNN)A former Miami Dolphins player apparently lived up to his old NFL team's name and says he swam nine miles in the ocean to shore after falling off his boat. Fighting back tears, Rob Konrad, 38, recounted an incredible story Monday at a press conference in Plantation, Florida. He said he swam through cold water in the Atlantic Ocean for about 16 hours, alternating between the breast stroke and backstroke. Jellyfish stung him, and he was once circled by a shark, he said. Appearing healthy, his wife sitting next to him, Konrad told reporters that, treading water in the moments after falling off his boat Wednesday off the South Florida coast, he knew how improbable his survival was. He had read about what happens to the body under such circumstances. He figured that he had maybe three hours before hypothermia set in. It might take him more than 10 hours, at best, to get to shore. But he told himself he would make it. ""I've got two beautiful daughters,"" he said, his eyes watering. ""I was hitting shore."" Konrad said he departed alone in his 36-foot Grady White boat from Deerfield Beach, Florida, at about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday and went about nine miles offshore. He set the boat on autopilot for 5 mph and started to fish. He said he hooked a fish around 1 p.m. and while trying to reel it in, a huge wave smashed into the boat and he lost his footing and fell overboard. The boat was moving east, he said, toward the Bahamas. He wasn't wearing a flotation device and didn't see any other boats around. ""I quickly realized I was in a real bad situation,"" he recounted. ""I made a decision that I was going to start swimming toward shore, west."" Over the next 16 hours, he said he had two opportunities to be rescued. He saw a recreational fishing vessel. He was floating about 50 yards from it and tried to swim closer, but no one spotted or heard him. A little later, a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter circled and shined its light on him, he recounted. ""They had come right over the top of me,"" he said. But the helicopter flew away. ""That was a difficult time. I realized at that point in time ... I was on my own."" Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Gabe Somma told CNN on Monday that Palm Beach authorities contacted the Coast Guard to report that Konrad was missing and that it had a helicopter out looking for the former fullback. Down to his underwear, Konrad alternated between breast stroke and backstroke, mustering the strength to keep swimming. He made it through the night, and managed to coach himself to remain calm despite seeing ""glowing"" creatures in the water. When he heard waves crashing against the shore, he told himself: ""At that point, you can't not make it?"" At around 4:30 a.m. Thursday, Konrad said he hit the shore in Palm Beach. He was shivering uncontrollably so he curled into a ball and tried to warm himself up. He had trouble walking but eventually made his way to a home where a security guard was working. The guard notified that Palm Beach Police Department, according to a department report. Konrad was taken to the hospital, where he said he was treated for hypothermia, severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, the breakdown of muscle tissue. Konrad's remarkable experience has wowed distance swimmers. Sid Cassidy, a nationally renowned distance swimmer, has swum the 22-mile course around Atlantic City, New Jersey, five times. He's trained in the same waters in South Florida where Konrad fought against the odds. ""If you're a good swimmer and you're faced with an emergency, you could be capable of doing what he did,"" Cassidy said. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said it is investigating the boat incident. Depending on Konrad's location in the Gulf Stream, he would have had to swim west, across the water's south-to-north current, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. The current could have been up to 4 mph. Normally swimming a mile in the ocean could take 20 to 30 minutes -- if a person is very fit, Cassidy said. Most professional swimmers don't attempt that many miles without help from a team providing hydration and nutrition. Konrad is the CEO of Alterna Financial, a South Florida financial services company. A fullback, he played at Syracuse University and was drafted by the Dolphins in the second round of the 1999 NFL Draft. He played his entire pro career for the Dolphins -- 82 games, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He was released from his contract in 2005. ""I can't imagine that swimming isn't part of his typical workout,"" Cassidy said. Konrad said he judged which direction to swim by looking at the sun during the day and the stars at night. But even if Konrad knew which direction to start swimming, he'd have to contend with constant saltwater in his eyes, intense muscle fatigue, wind and, of course, current, noted Bruce Wigo, president and CEO of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale. ""From the salt alone, you'd have a tongue the size of a baseball,"" said Wigo. It makes sense that Konrad stripped down in the water to lessen the drag, Wigo added. A former pro athlete like Konrad knows what it takes to push past pain, Cassidy surmised. He would know how to focus and to stay calm, too. Sitting next to her husband Monday, Tammy Konrad said he has always been the kind of guy who never gives up. ""Rob is a very powerful human being,"" she said.

"Washington (CNN)Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan will not run for president in 2016, he said in a statement on Monday, preferring instead to focus on policy work as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ""After giving it a lot of thought, I've decided not to run for president. Our work at the House Ways and Means Committee over the next few years will be crucial to moving America forward, and my job as chairman deserves undivided attention,"" he said. Romney vs. Bush: The establishment match-up . ""It's clear our country needs a change in direction. And our party has a responsibility to offer a real alternative. So I'm going to do what I can to lay out conservative solutions and to help our nominee lead us to victory,"" Ryan added. Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice-presidential nominee, has long been seen as a top contender for the presidency. The nine-term congressman has made a national name for himself as a policy wonk on Capitol Hill, helping to draft and promote the GOP's budget proposals as chairman of the House Budget Committee. Indeed, the Real Clear Politics average of national political polls of the potential 2016 Republican field found Ryan in third place, behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. A CNN/ORC poll conducted in mid-December, however, found him farther down in the pack, tying for sixth with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But even as he's decided to say no to a presidential bid, Republicans have a chance for deja vu with his top-of-the-ticket running mate, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Romney recently told donors that he's considering a 2016 run for president, and has led a number of national polls of the potential field. But Ryan told NBC News that his decision came over the holidays, long before Romney appeared to be inching towards another bid. ""It is no secret that I have always thought Mitt would make a great president,"" he said. ""As for his plans for 2016, I don't know what he is ultimately going to do and the last thing I want to do is get ahead of his own decision making process."" Ryan wouldn't offer his support for any potential GOP contender, however. ""I think we've got a number of very capable candidates who have every ability to become president. There are a lot of talented people,"" he told NBC in a phone interview. ""I think it is critical that our party puts forward bold, conservative ideas and give people a choice. I think we have a number of capable leaders who can do that.""","Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan will not run for president in 2016, he said Monday .

"(CNN)California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is opting out of running for retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer's seat, he announced Monday in a Facebook post. ""It's always better to be candid than coy. While I am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office, I know that my head and my heart, my young family's future, and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the State of California --- not Washington D.C,"" he wrote. ""Therefore I will not seek election to the U.S. Senate in 2016."" Boxer's retirement sets off wild scramble . His decision not to run focuses attention on California Attorney General Kamala Harris, another California rising star who's considered a top contender for the seat if she jumps in. Both have been developing their statewide and national profiles, and they also share the same California-based strategists, increasing the likelihood that if one runs for Senate, the other would opt out. California political observers speculated before Newsom's announcement that they two might have struck a pact where Harris runs for Boxer's seat and Newsom waits to run for Governor after his two terms as lieutenant governor. She was mum on the topic when asked about her future political plans by the Los Angeles Times on Sunday. ""I am just enjoying this day, thank you,"" she said. But she won't have a walk to the seat if she runs. A wide array of potential contenders in both parties have expressed interest in the seat, including billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer and, over the weekend, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, another of the state's rising Democratic stars. California's jungle primary system means all candidates, regardless of party, face off on the primary ballot, and the top-two vote-getters head to a runoff in November. The prospect has some Republicans hopeful that too many Democratic candidates running could split the party's vote and leave them an opportunity to make it through to the second round of voting. They admit, however, that's a long-shot â€” the GOP's bench in California remains thin, and the state is reliably blue.","California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he won't run for Sen.

"(CNN)Andrew Brannan, 66, who is scheduled to be put to death this week for the murder of a 22-year-old Georgia sheriff's deputy in 1998, is hoping his sentence will be found uniquely unconstitutional. His defense attorneys claim Brannan, a decorated veteran who served in Vietnam in the early '70s, was suffering from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorder at the time of the shooting and was off his medication. In a petition filed Monday with the Butts County Superior County, Brannan's attorneys are requesting the Brannan's life be spared because it violates the U.S. Constitution. The appeal states that ""executing American combat veterans whose service-related mental impairments played a role in subsequent violent conduct violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and analogous provisions of the Georgia Constitution."" The document goes on to say ""death is inappropriate for those with diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others."" Attorneys Joseph Loveland Jr. and Brian Kammer, who represent Brannan, say that the death penalty is reserved for the ""worst of the worst"" offenders who commit murder and that Brannan does not fit that category. They contend his mental problems were directly related to his combat service and defense of the country's interests and ideals. They are also petitioning the Georgia Parole Board that his sentence be commuted to life in prison. The killing of Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller was captured on the deputy's dash camera just outside Dublin, Georgia. Versions of the video have been uploaded to YouTube. Brannan is seen in the video confronting Dinkheller after being pulled over for driving almost 100 miles per hour in his pickup. Brannan appears to be confrontational from the start, acting irrational as the deputy tells him to keep his hands out of his pocket. He then mocks the deputy and at one point seems to dance around yelling ""shoot me"" at Dinkheller. Brannan then yells that he is a Vietnam veteran. He lunges at the deputy before he runs back to his truck, grabs a rifle and begins to shoot. The video goes on to show a heated gun battle as both men hide behind their vehicles for cover. Bullets appear to pierce the windshield of the deputy's car. Brannan's car door window shatters above his head. Dinkheller and Brannan are shot and wounded in the battle. But Brannan is able to advance on the deputy, and off camera, you hear the deputy scream before Brannan repeatedly shoots Dinkheller and then flees the scene. Dinkheller died, leaving behind a wife and child. Brannan, who had no criminal record before the shooting, was convicted of the murder in 2000. During the trial, Kammer says the defense did present evidence that Brannan suffered from PTSD but claims that crucial testimony from the VA doctor treating him was never heard. His sentence was appealed, and a judge ordered a new sentencing trial, but that was later overturned by the Georgia Supreme Court. Kyle Dinkheller's father, Kirk Dinkheller, posted on his Facebook page earlier this month that ""January 12, 2015 it will be 17 years since my son Kyle was murdered in the line of duty and on January 13, 2015 his killer will finally be held accountable. Nothing will ever bring my son back, but finally some justice for the one who took him from his children and his family.""

"The winner of the 2012 commencement sweepstakes is in.  It's Barnard College, which just announced that President Obama will be the featured speaker at its May 14 graduation ceremonies. The choice benefits both the president and Barnard, a 123-year-old women's college in New York City.  Barnard outdoes neighboring Columbia and every other Ivy League college when it comes to commencement prestige.  Obama, in turn, gets the perfect setting to talk about women's rights. The Republicans have made a national issue of limiting access to contraception, and Barnard provides the president with a forum to make his views on the subject clear. This comes at a time when the Guttmacher Institute reports that of the 43 million fertile American women who do not want to get pregnant, 89% are practicing birth control. In the Columbia Spectator college paper, the president's commencement address was the lead story Monday and a source of controversy and envy. Barnard students often take classes at Columbia, which actually confers the Barnard diplomas. Obama clearly trumps Columbia's commencement speaker, John R. MacArthur, the president and publisher of  Harper's Magazine. But Barnard's coup in securing the president, whose aides contacted Barnard last week, according to university President Debora L. Spar, raises an important question:  How do colleges choose their commencement speakers? At institutions that pride themselves on being democratic, the process all too rarely involves meaningful consultation.  Sometimes, students are asked whom they want for a speaker.  Occasionally, faculty members are solicited for their opinion.  But the asking around is most often window dressing. Usually, the commencement speaker is chosen by a college president or key administrator.   In Barnard's case, Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The New York Times, was the announced speaker.  But when Obama became available, Abramson was quickly dropped. As critics have noted, so much for a women's college worrying about favoring a powerful man over a woman! In an age when budgets are stretched thin, many colleges are still willing to pay thousands of dollars to get the most newsworthy person they can find to address their graduating seniors.  A famous commencement speaker is an expense that colleges believe will pay dividends down the line. Perhaps colleges are right?  Maybe the commencement game is worth playing to the hilt.  But I think it is equally possible that colleges are kidding themselves.   My alternative is that colleges should try choosing their commencement speakers according to the following rules: . 1.      Ask the senior class whom it wants to hear at its graduation, and publish the results early in the fall. 2.      Make sure the seniors know who is available to speak. 3.      Require the commencement speaker to donate any lecture fees to the college scholarship fund and not profit from an invitation that should be considered an educational honor. 4.      Insist that the speakers talk no longer than 15 minutes and never use the phrase ""real world."" 5.      Strongly urge the speaker to recall what the world felt like when he or she was 22. These five rules should do the trick, but it is important to remember that there are always exceptions.  The wise college won't try to control every facet of commencement.  It will allow for surprises. The most important commencement address in modern American history occurred June 5, 1947, at Harvard, when Secretary of State and former Army Chief of Staff  George Marshall delivered the talk that became the basis for the Marshall Plan. Nobody anticipated how momentous Marshall's address would be. He spoke for just 12 minutes, and all he said to Harvard President James Conant in advance was that he intended ""to make a few remarks in appreciation of the honor and perhaps a little more."" My ideal commencement speaker for 2012, as I have told anyone who will listen, would be Little Richard, who turns 80 in December. Little Richard is, I believe, our greatest living rock 'n' roller, and one rendition of ""Tutti Frutti"" by him would make even the most humdrum commencement magical. But few of the students I teach would agree with me about Little Richard, and I am easy about bowing to their wishes.  Commencement is, it cannot be stressed enough, their day: It should be about who and what they think is important.","Nicolaus Mills: Barnard wins commencement prize with Obama, to Columbia's dismay .
Mills: Women's college Barnard is the perfect stage for Obama to speak on women's rights .

On December 29, Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on UK soil shortly after returning from Sierra Leone. On January 3, London's Royal Free Hospital said Cafferkey's condition had deteriorated to critical. But in a statement Monday, the hospital updated her condition. ""The Royal Free Hospital is pleased to announce that Pauline Cafferkey is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill,"" it said. ""She remains in isolation as she receives specialist care for the Ebola virus."" On December 31, the hospital said Cafferkey had decided to have a blood plasma treatment -- using plasma from Ebola survivors -- and to take an experimental antiviral drug. The Royal Free is equipped with a high-level isolation unit, where access is restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent with controlled ventilation covers the patient's bed. Cafferkey had been working at Save the Children's Kerry Town Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone for six weeks before she returned to Glasgow via Casablanca and London Heathrow airports. Last week, Save the Children said it was ""doing everything possible"" to establish how Cafferkey contracted Ebola and had been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus.","A UK nurse infected with Ebola has improved and is no longer critically ill, hospital says .

"(CNN) -- A New York man fatally stabbed three people, slashed at least five others, hit and killed one man with a car and hijacked two vehicles before being wrestled to the ground early Saturday while trying to break into the cab of a subway car, police said. Maksim Gelman, who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist, was arrested aboard a northbound train in Manhattan around 9 a.m. Saturday, about 28 hours after he allegedly began a spree that spanned three New York City boroughs, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. ""It's so horrendous and bizarre,"" Kelly told reporters Saturday afternoon. ""We have no reason that we can give you as to why he did this."" Around 5 a.m. Friday, police say Gelman, 23, got into a dispute with his mother at her home in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. She had refused to let him take her 2004 gray Lexus. The suspect's stepfather intervened and was stabbed 11 times, according to Kelly. The stepfather -- Aleksandr Kuznetsov, 54 -- died, while the mother alerted authorities after surviving unscathed. Police believe Gelman, having then taken the Lexus, fatally stabbed the mother of his ex-girlfriend 11 times in her Brooklyn home around 10:30 a.m. The victim, 56-year-old Anna Bulchenko, lived there -- which was about a mile north of the earlier stabbing -- with her daughter. Around 4:15 p.m., Gelman's former girlfriend returned home, found her mother dead on the floor and called 911 three times, police said. Commissioner Kelly said all the calls, the last of which came in around 4:18 p.m., were brief and that authorities had arrived on the scene around 4:20 p.m. In that short period, Gelman -- presumably lurking somewhere in the apartment -- went after 20-year-old Yelena Bulchenko with a knife, Kelly said. Likely stabbing her first inside, the suspect allegedly chased his former girlfriend into the street and -- after kniving the jacket sleeve of a passerby trying to stop him -- killed her. ""There's no indication on the (911) tapes that she was aware of him being present,"" Kelly said. ""(It seemed) a tremendously traumatic experience for her."" Gelman hopped back into his Lexus, and rear-ended a 1995 Pontiac Bonneville, according to police. He stabbed that car's driver -- a 60-year-old man whom Gelman did not know -- in the shoulder and neck in a confrontation, ditched his Lexus and left the scene in the Pontiac. Police said they later found four kitchen knives inside the Lexus. As of Saturday afternoon, the Pontiac's original driver was in stable condition at a local hospital recovering from three stab wounds to the chest, according to the commissioner. Around 4:25 p.m., Gelman drove the Pontiac into a pedestrian about two miles away in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, Kelly said. The man, later identified as 60-year-old Steve Tannenbaum, died of his injuries. The suspect eventually abandoned the Pontiac, which was found in Brooklyn near a railroad line that Gelman was known to frequent as a graffiti artist. Shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday, according to Kelly, Gelman hopped into a cab in Brooklyn and stabbed its driver. That man is also in stable condition at a local hospital. The commissioner said Gelman then got out of the cab and confronted a couple, stabbing a 25-year-old man in the hands and taking his keys to a Nissan. That man, who Kelly said suffered only defensive wounds, was treated and released at a hospital. The Nissan was later found in the New York City borough of Queens, not far from a subway station. Around 8:30 a.m. Saturday, New York police got a phone tip that Gelman might have been riding on a southbound subway train in Manhattan. Another witness, who approached police at a subway stop, said Gelman knocked from her hands a newspaper that featured his picture and alleged exploits and said to her, ""Do you believe what they're writing about me?"" Gelman crossed the tracks at a midtown Manhattan stop and jumped onto a northbound express train. The suspect stabbed another passenger -- a 40-year-old man, whom Gelman didn't appear to know -- in the head and neck sometime during his time onboard, Kelly said. That male subway passenger is also in stable condition. Eventually, the suspect worked his way to the front cab of the train. The commissioner said Gelman pounded on the cab's door, yelling ""Police"" -- apparently trying to get in, by claiming he was a police officer. He did not appear to know two transit police officers, later identified as Terrance Howell and Tamara Taylor, were inside the cab with the train's operator. Soon after, the officers -- with aid from off-duty New York police Det. Marcelo Razzo and an unnamed civilian nearby -- wrestled Gelman to the ground. No one was hurt in that scuffle, during which a knife fell to the ground. Police also found Gelman had another, smaller, knife when they detained him. He also had what Kelly described as a ""significant amount of money."" ""This was a tremendous effort,"" Kelly said, referring to the various law enforcement units and tools used to look for Gelman. Kelly said the suspect was mostly ""incoherent"" after being arrested, besides a statement that ""she had to die."" The commissioner said he did not know if ""she"" referred to Yelena Bulchenko, her mother or someone else. As of Saturday afternoon, Gelman had not yet been charged with any crime and was in a Manhattan police precinct. Kelly said Gelman had 10 previous arrests, mostly for drug charges and graffiti, plus one robbery charge. His most recent arrest came on January 26, when he was accused of possessing crack. For roughly the past seven years, Gelman has been a naturalized U.S. citizen. He arrived in this country with his father and mother in 1992 from his native Ukraine. CNN's Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect tried to get into the front of a subway car, saying he was police .

"Democratic governors are working every day to grow and strengthen a middle class that's been under assault from global economic forces and failed, trickle-down policies for decades. In furtherance of that mission, we will be proud to stand with President Barack Obama, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee at Central Connecticut State University this afternoon to announce actions we're taking to raise the minimum wage in our states to $10.10 an hour by 2017. House Republicans continue to block progress on this critical issue for middle class families. But that doesn't mean this common-sense idea, like so many others before it, needs to die a Washington-inflicted death. With a paralyzed Congress, Democratic governors will act. We'll do so with the benefit of having the American people on our side. Democrats, Republicans and independents alike overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows 63% of Americans support it. Here's why: . One, it makes good economic sense. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour. Adjusted for inflation, that's lower than it was in 1968. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour nationally will provide 28 million Americans with more money to spend and to invest, increasing economic activity and growth. In fact, recent studies conclude that raising the minimum wage makes workers more productive and therefore helps businesses retain profitability -- a conclusion affirmed by Gap Inc.'s recent decision to raise the minimum wage for its employees to $10.10 an hour. Two, it's good for women. Women account for roughly two-thirds of workers whose incomes would rise by increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. These women currently work 40 hours a week to make just $14,500 a year. These women are our daughters, sisters and mothers who are often the only breadwinners in their families. Our country is in a stronger position when women are in a stronger economic position. We need to make that a reality. Three, it's the right thing to do. No American working 40 hours or more a week deserves to live in poverty. Republican governors across the country have also stood in the way of progress. Some have pandered to stereotype, suggesting that a raise in the minimum wage should be rejected because it would only help young workers rather than acknowledging that 88% of workers who would be affected by moving the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour are over the age of 20, and more are over the age of 55 than are teenagers. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez went so far as to veto minimum wage hikes in their states. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker mocked the idea, while Florida Gov. Rick Scott described how the proposal makes him ""cringe."" Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett and Maine Gov. Paul LePage all oppose this common-sense change. And of course there is billionaire Bruce Rauner, running in Illinois, who went so far as to suggest slashing minimum wage workers' salaries by a dollar an hour in order to keep the state ""competitive."" They just don't get it. Just look at Bobby Jindal, former Republican Governors Association chair and current governor of Louisiana, who recently said -- in a widely-criticized partisan outburst outside the White House -- that raising the minimum wage was equivalent to ""waving the white flag of surrender"" on the economy. That's patently absurd. But it's what the tea party wants to hear. A fair minimum wage was once an issue upon which Republican and Democratic leaders could agree. But now, the Republican Congress and Republican governors have embraced partisanship and right-wing ideology rather than economic growth. And that's why we are standing with President Obama today to make clear we won't wait for Republicans to come around -- we're going to give hard-working Americans a raise and we are going to start today.

"(CNN)A former Florida A&M University band member has been sentenced to more than six years in prison for organizing the hazing that killed drum major Robert Champion Jr. Dante Martin, 27, was one of 15 people charged in the 2011 hazing incident. Prosecutors said he organized the brutal initiation, known as ""Crossing Bus C,""  that band members had to go through. In October, Martin was found guilty of manslaughter and felony hazing. On Friday, an Orange County circuit court judge sentenced him to 77 months. ""I honestly am ashamed that I can even remotely be a part or associated with anything that could take the life of a human being,"" Martin, who didn't testify at trial, said in court Friday. ""It hurts me. I'm terribly sorry."" Champion, 26 of Decatur, Georgia, died after he was beaten aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida. The initiation requires pledges to run down the center of the bus while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. A medical examiner ruled Champion's death a homicide, saying he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows and internal bleeding from the beating. Champion died in the parking lot within an hour of the assault. FAMU's famed marching band, known as the Marching 100, was suspended for the 2012-13 school year after Champion's death. The college pledged to make reforms and address hazing both on and off campus. FAMU is one of the nation's top university marching bands, famous for its elaborate dance formations and innovative style. In court Friday, both Champion's mother and father addressed Martin. ""I just want to let you know, I forgive you. I don't hate you at all,"" mother Pam Champion said. ""And I don't want you shedding tears for my family because my fight is not over. My fight is not with you."" Nine former band members have pleaded guilty to lesser charges and received community service and probation. Three others go on trial later this year.","Dante Martin, 27, was one of 15 people charged in the incident .

"(CNN)On Sunday, at almost the same moment that dozens of world leaders linked arms and led millions of people through the streets of Paris to commemorate the 17 victims of last week's terror attacks in France, explosives carried by two young girls ripped through a mobile phone market in the northeastern Nigerian town of Potiskum. The blasts, which killed three people besides the bombers and injured 46 more, came just a day after another bomb, strapped to a girl described by witnesses as about 10 years old, exploded in a busy market in the city of Maiduguri, killing at least 20 people. While coming in widely divergent settings, thousands of miles apart, the attacks in France and Nigeria were both motivated by an Islamist extremist ideology that rejects a modern world shaped by political, economic, and social liberalism -- and in the case of Boko Haram, whose name can be roughly translated as ""(Western) education is forbidden,"" also abhors scientific progress. To achieve this end, no deed is too brutal or tactic too low, as is underscored both by the recent actions of Boko Haram and the posthumously posted video by the gunman who killed four hostages in a kosher grocery store near Paris. The difference has been that while there has been an outpouring of solidarity for the French victims and pledges of international solidarity for France's stand against violent extremism, nothing similar has been forthcoming for Nigeria's fight against the growing power of Boko Haram, at least not since the ephemeral and largely ineffectual global social media phenomenon of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign last year. This is despite the fact that over the course of recent months, Boko Haram has proven itself to be as much of a threat to international peace and security as the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which has received so much attention. In fact, as Jamestown Foundation terrorism analyst Jacob Zenn has pointed out, Boko Haram's videos show a troubling convergence between the Nigerian militants and their ISIS counterparts not only in terms of symbolism and ideology, but also insurgency doctrine. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, for example, first expressed ""support"" for the ISIS caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, this past summer. Meanwhile, Boko Haram has added the jihadist black banner to its logo and the ISIS anthem to the musical repertoire on its videos. In one recent video, Shekau even seemed to declare that he is establishing his own ""Islamic Caliphate"" and greeted his ""brothers"" in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, as well as ""the Caliphate in Iraq and Syria."" Even more worrisome than Boko Haram's extremist ideology and gruesome terrorist acts should be the increasing military sophistication demonstrated by the Nigerian militants. Alas, while it is largely ignored by American and European leaders and only sporadically covered by major media outlets, Boko Haram has been steadily gaining ground in its war against Nigeria. As I wrote several months ago, Boko Haram has, like ISIS, clearly moved beyond one-off asymmetric attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in the assimilation of increasingly large chunks of territory, successfully overrunning and now effectively controlling large portions of three states in northeastern Nigeria -- by some estimates, a total area larger than the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg combined. Boko Haram's territorial base has been used by the group as a staging ground for what has become a steady campaign of terrorist attacks, like the past weekend's suicide bombings, which regularly hit more than half a dozen other Nigerian states as well as neighboring countries like Niger, many of which are already under significant pressure from militants linked to al Qaeda's North African affiliate. Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou has even gone so far as to declare to the newsmagazine Jeune Afrique that ""the Islamic State is at our door."" By some estimates, more than 10,000 people in Nigeria alone have died as a result of Boko Haram-related violence in 2014, while more than 1.5 million others have been displaced. Just last week, the militants stormed Baga on the shores of Lake Chad, one of the last towns in the region remaining in government hands, reportedly killing more than 2,000 civilians. Moreover, the militants are showing increasingly advanced conventional military capabilities, in contrast with the demoralized Nigerian military forces they square off against. In early September, for example, the group shot down a Nigerian attack jet that was operating against it and captured the pilot, whom it later apparently beheaded, according to a video obtained by The Associated Press. What makes the threat from Boko Haram all the more significant is the political and economic context of Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and the largest economy on the continent. The West African country is in the midst of a hotly contested general election, including a rematch presidential race between incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan and former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, with votes to be cast just a month from now. No doubt Boko Haram, which rejects democratic politics along with other ""infidel"" ideas, will take advantage of the campaign and voting process to step up attacks. It is hard to imagine how the threat could not have an impact on the vote. In Paris on Sunday, police and military forces fanned out across the French capital, meaning there was a reasonable sense of safety for marchers. In Nigeria, even if the country deployed every last soldier and policeman, it would barely be able to put one security officer at each of its polling stations. And, as if this were not bad enough, declining oil prices have slashed Nigerian government revenues, substantially diminishing the resources available to defeat the extremists in battle and win the subsequent peace with social and economic development of an area whose long-running marginalization helped give rise to the insurgency in the first place. It does, of course, go without saying that both the Nigerian political class and its military, with all their attendant pathologies, bear responsibility for the dire situation the country finds itself in. But that fact alone should not absolve the international community of its obligation (and self-interest) in helping to tackle the growing threat posed by Boko Haram -- any more than legitimate concerns about generally lackluster leadership by French President François Hollande and the French political elite's failure to deal squarely with the potential for radicalization among segments of the country's marginalized Muslim population prevented world leaders from showing their support for France in recent days. As the Roman Catholic archbishop of Jos, Nigeria, pleaded on the BBC recently, ""We need that spirit to be spread around...Not just when it happens in Europe, but when it happens in Nigeria, in Cameroon."" In the struggle against Islamist extremism and for peaceful coexistence and progress, it is time the international community recognized there is no place for a tale of two cities.","J.

"Paris (CNN)""Thank you,"" said the man. I was standing outside of the offices of Charlie Hebdo covering the aftermath of the terrorist attacks for CNN. He was thanking me just for being here, just for covering the event and its aftermath, what Le Monde referred to as France's September 11. And his appreciation was echoed by French citizen after French citizen. The rally Sunday for unity drew 1.5 million people in Paris and more than twice that nationwide; it was like nothing I've ever seen or covered. Our nation's oldest ally stood firm. A young Muslim Frenchwoman held a sign saying ""Je suis Juif."" A man and his son came over to me holding a sign saying ""I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it,"" beseeching me to share their message with the American people. And world leaders were standing together amidst a procession that included Francois Hollande of France, Angela Merkel of Germany, David Cameron of Great Britain, Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, along with the leaders of Mali, Jordan and Turkey. It is no small thing for the king of Jordan, a direct descendent of the Prophet Mohammed, to march in a rally prompted by the murders of people who mocked Islam as well as of innocent Jews -- all of whom were killed by Islamic extremists. The United States, which considers itself to be the most important nation in the world, was not represented in this march -- arguably one of the most important public demonstrations in Europe in the last generation -- except by U.S. Ambassador Jane Hartley, who may have been a few rows back. I didn't see her.  Even Russia sent Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. I say this as an American -- not as a journalist, not as a representative of CNN -- but as an American: I was ashamed. I certainly understand the security concerns when it comes to sending President Barack Obama, though I can't imagine they're necessarily any greater than sending the lineup of other world leaders, especially in aggregate. But I find it hard to believe that collectively President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Attorney General Eric Holder -- who was actually in France that day for a conference on counterterrorism -- just had no time in their schedules on Sunday. Holder had time to do the Sunday shows via satellite but not to show the world that he stood with the people of France? There was higher-level Obama administration representation on this season's episodes of ""The Good Wife"" on CBS. I get that the President visited the French Embassy in Washington and that Secretary of State John Kerry spoke in French, and I certainly understand that the American commitment to security in Europe rivals no other. But with all due respect, those are politicians spending money that they didn't earn and sending troops whom they don't know. And this is not just a matter of the current occupant of the White House. I find it hard to believe that Speaker of the House John Boehner and new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had more worthy pursuits on Sunday than standing side-by-side with our French brothers and sisters as they came together in an inspirational way. After September 11, the first world leader to visit the United States was France's Jacques Chirac, though the most forceful conversation about France in Congress that I can recall came a few years later during debate over whether to invade Iraq and revolved around renaming pommes frites in the U.S. House cafeteria. And I'm frankly floored that not one of the people who is contemplating running for president in 2016 has yet to even tweet on the subject of the momentous demonstration in Paris, much less attend France's biggest rally in the history of the republic. I imagine that Hillary Clinton and her husband are kicking themselves for not hopping on a corporate jet to get here. Can you picture Hillary and Bill walking in the front row, arm-in-arm with Netanyahu and  Hollande? Chris Christie, Scott Walker and Paul Ryan attended the Green Bay-Dallas football game Sunday and at least one of them sent his potential rivals mischievous tweets as if they were contemplating running for president of Beta Theta Pi. And Jeb? Mitt? Crickets. Why? I hope it's not American arrogance, a belief that everyone should express shock when something bad happens to us but that our presence at an international rally is worth less than a ticket to the Green Bay game when the victims speak in accents we don't understand. I suppose there's always the risk that coming to an event like this as an American leader and getting stuck in the third row could be embarrassing or could lead to accusations that you're trying to capitalize on a tragedy. But that's not how it would have been interpreted in France. People here are happy that Americans care. They're eager and appreciative of any evidence of that. And I know it exists -- although American Twitter seemed much more focused on the Golden Globes than anything else Sunday night. I only wish our leaders had done a better job of showing solidarity with the passion for the freedoms exemplified by the rally.","Jake Tapper: American leaders were conspicuously absent from historic Paris rally .

"What's killing the East Coast dolphins? The carcasses of dozens of the marine mammals, seven times more than normal, have been washing up on beaches this summer, and scientists are struggling for answers to the die-off. In Virginia alone, at least 164 dead dolphins have been found this year, said Joan M. Barns, public relations manager for the Virginia Aquarium in Virginia Beach. Almost half of those, 78, have washed ashore in August, she said. As of Tuesday, federal authorities say, they have recorded 228 dolphin deaths this year from New York to Virginia. In all of 2012, 111 deaths were recorded. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued an Unusual Mortality Event in response to the deaths. The declaration brings special federal attention to deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give ""insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare,"" according to NOAA's website. The current declaration for the mid-Atlantic bottlenose dolphins is one of 60 Unusual Mortality Events the agency has issued since they were established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1991. Causes, including infections, biotoxins, human intervention and malnutrition, have been determined for the 29 of those cases. Early speculation into the latest deaths, which have spiked this month, is focused on an infection. ""Based on the rapid increase in strandings over the last two weeks and the geographic extent of these mortalities, an infectious pathogen is at the top of the list of potential causes for this UME, but all potential causes of these mortalities will be evaluated,"" NOAA said in announcing the mortality event. ""Work is underway to determine whether an infectious agent affecting these dolphins is present in collected tissue samples."" Susan Barco, research coordinator for the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center, said necropsies are providing clues. ""We're starting now to see lesions in their lungs that are consistent with some sort of a respiratory infection,"" she said. ""We're seeing very active lymph nodes, which means they're actively fighting an infection."" Both Barco and Charlie Potter, marine mammal collections manager of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, said scientists are looking at the morbillivirus, which was thought to be behind a die-off of 740 dolphins along the East Coast in 1987. It has been found in some of the animals studied this year, Potter told NPR. ""Morbilli is a group or family of viruses, and it includes things such as measles and distemper,"" Potter told NPR. ""So that one of the big questions are facing us right now is the extent of this infection and whether or not the infection is something that's always been there and what we're just picking up because of increased surveillance, or is this perhaps the smoking gun that we've been looking for?"" Barco said there could be other causes. ""Lung infections is one of the characteristics of morbillivirus, but it's not the only thing that can cause a lung infection. So again, we're not sure these animals are sick animals, and we're finding problems in many of their organ systems, and we are concerned that they may be immuno-suppressed, and they may be getting any number of things that are causing them to die."" On the Smithsonian's blog, Potter said the virus may be something that is exacerbated by other stresses in the dolphins' environment, mainly pollution in the form of pesticides, heavy metals and hydrocarbons. The preponderance of males and calves among the dead dolphins gives rise to those suspicions. ""Males don't have a mechanism for shedding contaminants,"" Potter said on the blog. ""The females shed significant amounts of their lipid-soluble contaminants through lactation, so the calf gets a hell of a dose early on in life, and some of the most outrageous levels of contaminants we've seen have been in calves."" Whatever the reason, dying dolphins send a warning to humans, Barco said. ""Bottlenose dolphins are a higher-order predator. They're often referred to as 'ocean sentinels of health.' So when our bottlenose dolphins are healthy, it would probably indicate that we have a fairly healthy ecosystem. When our bottlenose dolphins are not healthy, it may very well indicate that our ecosystem is not healthy,"" she said. Dolphins may be calling each other by name . The aquarium researcher also said she fears that the disease and deaths could spread south. ""We suspect, as dolphins move, that the event will move, too. Unfortunately we're afraid this is going to continue for a little while, and this will continue through the fall migration,"" she said, possibly reaching as far as Florida. That state has its own Unusual Mortality Event this year, with bottlenose dolphin strandings in the Indian River Lagoon system at three times historical averages. Manatee deaths are also up there, and no cause has been determined, according to NOAA. For the Smithsonian's Potter, who has been working with stranded dolphin response teams in Virginia, the die-off takes a personal toll. ""When you sit back and think about it, it does stick with you,"" he told NPR. ""Unfortunately, a number of the animals we've looked at have been neonates, that is, infants. And as a father, that's always hard to do."" China's white dolphins headed for extinction?

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- A Kenyan man has sued activists who called on women to boycott sex to protest the growing divide in the nation's coalition government. James Kimondo said the seven-day sex ban, which ended this week, resulted in stress, mental anguish, backaches and lack of sleep, his lawyer told the state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corp. The lawsuit filed Friday claims lack of conjugal rights affected Kimondo's marriage and seeks undisclosed damages from the G-10, an umbrella group for women's activists, KBC said. The women's caucus caused a national debate when it urged women to withhold sex to protest increasingly frosty relations between President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Citizens of the east African nation are frustrated by a shaky coalition government, which was formed after post-election violence killed more than 1,000 people in 2008. The wrangling between Kibaki and Odinga has sparked fears of more violence. Gender activists say they are not worried about the lawsuit. ""I have not been served with the papers, but I was told they are coming and I am eagerly waiting,"" said Ann Njogu, executive, director of Centers for Rights Education and Awareness. ""It will be interesting to see the face of a man who is not willing to abstain for the sake of his country."" Despite the lawsuit, Njogu said, the boycott was successful. ""The principal leaders met as a result of the boycott, and I understand that they are setting up reforms to look into the country's internal security,"" she said. Plans are under way for women activists to meet with Kibaki and Odinga, according to Njogu. CNN's Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","Kenyan sues activists, claims recent sex ban affected his marriage .

"Israeli forces dropped leaflets in northern Gaza on Sunday to warn residents to move away from Hamas sites to avoid military strikes. The warning came as the death toll in Gaza reached 172, with more than 1,250 people injured, the Gaza Health Ministry said early Monday. About 70% of the fatalities were civilians, of which 30% were children, said Chris Gunness, spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, which said the figures came from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israel said its forces have struck 1,320 ""terror targets"" across Gaza, including 735 concealed rocket launchers. Seventy percent of Israel's population lies within range of Hamas rocket attacks, the Israel Defense Forces said. One airstrike targeted the house of the head of the Gaza police, Tayseer al-Batsh, and killed at least 18 people and injured 50, Palestinian security and medical sources told CNN on Sunday. The attack happened late Saturday. Israel has used its Iron Dome defense system against many of the more than 800 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel, the military said. Two more were intercepted Sunday over the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. One rocket that hit the city of Ashkelon on Sunday severely wounded an Israeli teen, the Israel Defense Forces said. ""All sides ... must respect the sanctity of civilian life,"" Gunness said on Twitter. Pierre Krahenbuhl, head of UNRWA, planned to visit Gaza on Sunday, but the Israeli military did not authorize the mission for security reasons, Gunness said. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier will hold meetings in the region in the coming days. ""Hope for peaceful resolution seems to be even further away,"" he said Sunday in a written statement, according to a CNN translation. ""Nevertheless, in this crisis we must establish dialogue with the political decision makers. That is why, above all, it is about ongoing talks in Amman, Jerusalem and Ramallah."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior State Department official said. Kerry ""condemned the rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel, and stressed Israel's right to defend itself,"" the official said.  Kerry also discussed U.S. concerns about escalating tensions and reiterated the U.S. is prepared to help facilitate a ceasefire, the official said. Gazans trickle out of north . Articles on Palestinian news sites showed residents trickling out of northern Gaza, headed to U.N. facilities. But not all U.N. facilities may be safe from violence. ""Worryingly, in the past 24 hours, nine UNRWA installations have been damaged,"" Gunness said Sunday.  ""All of these were schools, in Gaza City, the middle and north areas and around Rafah in the south of Gaza."" Some residents said they won't leave home. ""They will not vacate. ... Where do we go?"" asked Ramez Al-Madhoun, who lives in a building with 20 people in Beit Lahya. He said his building is home to seven adults, the rest children. In the background, the sound of rockets rang out from his northern Gaza neighborhood. Gazans generally are not allowed to cross into Israel, and Gaza's border with Egypt is closed. Many people from northern Gaza who have relatives elsewhere in the territory have left their homes. The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem assisted 150 U.S. citizens in evacuating out of Gaza and into Jordan on Sunday, the consulate said in a Facebook post. Battle over 'human shields' Video on Hamas-run television showed a Hamas spokesman urging people to serve as human shields, CNN's Jake Tapper reported Thursday. Palestinian sources have also described some deaths in the conflict as being people who formed a ""human shield."" But former Palestinian adviser Diana Buttu told ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that she does not believe ""people are going to listen to somebody who says stay inside while your house is being bombed."" Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, regularly uses sites and facilities populated by civilians. ""The leadership of Hamas and the other organizations has chosen -- at a time when they are using the population of Gaza as human shields -- to hide under ground, to flee abroad and to deliberately put civilians in the line of fire,"" Netanyahu told a Cabinet meeting Sunday. ""This is the entire difference between us and Hamas -- we are using defensive systems against missiles to protect the residents of Israel, and they are using the residents of Gaza to protect arsenals of missiles. Nothing better underscores the difference in this campaign. Israel is a democracy that is fighting -- in a legitimate and focused manner -- against unbridled terrorists,"" he said. The Palestine Liberation Organization, meanwhile, announced that it will ask the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, at its annual meeting in August, to designate Israel as an ""apartheid state.""  And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will ask the United Nations ""to officially put the State of Palestine under the UN international protection system,"" the PLO said. Israel raids missile site . Israeli forces briefly entered Gaza early Sunday and raided a missile launching site, an Israeli military source said.  It marked the first time Israeli forces have acknowledged they've entered Gaza in the current conflict. During the incursion, which lasted about half hour, both sides exchanged gunfire at the launch site, the source said. Four Israeli soldiers suffered light injuries, but all the troops returned home safely, the source said. The source declined to comment on whether the mission achieved its objective. It likely won't be the last mission of this type, an Israeli military spokesman told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We can expect these type of activities taking place,"" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. ""Special ops that happen usually below the radar, in and out, swift missions, quickly, concise and very precise at what they're doing, to get that added value to safeguard Israeli lives."" Lerner would not give specifics, but said leaflets had warned residents of one town in Gaza to evacuate ahead of military action. He said the area was the source of many rockets fired at Israel. Israel: 'What would you do?' Throughout the conflict, Israel has warned Gaza residents of upcoming attacks targeting militants and terrorist infrastructure. On Twitter on Sunday, the IDF posted: ""To warn civilians of an impending strike, the IDF drops leaflets, makes personalized phone calls & sends SMSes. How many militaries do that?"" ""Sirens heard across (Israel). Gaza terrorists are firing barrages of rockets. Israel is under attack,"" the IDF posted, with a photo asking ""What would you do?"" Another tweet Sunday showed large trucks. ""As rockets fall on Israel, we keep our crossing to Gaza open. 59 truckloads of goods are about to reach Palestinians,"" the post said. Hamas posted Saturday on its Twitter feed that it was going to strike Tel Aviv. ""Palestinians are defending themselves,"" the group posted Sunday, with a video that it said showed it targeting a tank. Hamas also tweeted that the ""death toll rises to 162 martyrs"" from Israeli airstrikes. In leaflets dropped Sunday, the IDF warned residents that it intends ""to attack terrorists and terror infrastructures."" The leaflets list areas that will be targeted. ""Israel is currently attacking, and will continue to attack, every area from which rockets are being launched at its territory."" The leaflets told residents which roads were safe to take and gave a time frame. ""The IDF is not interested in hurting you or your family members. These operations are limited and short. Whoever does not adhere to these instructions and does not vacate their house immediately is subjecting their lives and the lives of their children and family to danger,"" the leaflet said. The Israeli military said it also drops empty shells on roofs, an operation it calls ""roof knocking,"" to alert civilians that airstrikes are imminent. The goal of the airstrikes, the military said, is to get Hamas militants to stop firing rockets into Israel. Hostilities between the two sides escalated this month after the killing of three Israeli teenagers and a Palestinian teen. Neither Hamas nor Israel appears to be backing down. More than 10,000 Palestinians are displaced and hundreds of thousands have been affected by damage to water infrastructure, said UNWRA, the refugee agency. Concerns about a ground invasion by Israeli forces are growing, prompting the U.N. Security Council to call for a cease-fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants.

While working on ""The Last Supper,"" Leonardo da Vinci regularly took off  from painting for several hours at a time and seemed to be daydreaming aimlessly. Urged by his patron, the prior of Santa Maria delle Grazie, to work more continuously, da Vinci is reported to have replied, immodestly but accurately, ""The greatest geniuses sometimes accomplish more when they work less.""  --Tony Schwartz, ""Be Excellent at Anything"" In his 1932 classic essay, ""In Praise of Idleness,"" Bertrand Russell heralded a coming time when modern technology would bring shorter work hours and time for leisure to be enjoyed equally by everyone. Work and leisure both would be ""delightful,"" and the world would be the better for it. ""Every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving . . . Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness and dyspepsia."" Russell, along with scholars like Josef Pieper, author of ""Leisure, the Basis of Culture,"" thought that it is in moments of leisure that civilization gets created. Both were extraordinarily productive, despite their call for what may today be seen as slacking. But they argued that it is only when we take the time to lift our noses from the grindstone and are not busy with the getting, making and doing that ensures our survival, that flights of imagination, bursts of insight can lead to inventions like the wheel, art, philosophy, literature, scientific discoveries and innovation. At the turn of the 20th century, leisure time was the ultimate status symbol, a way not only of conspicuously showing off your wealth, but of your ability to enjoy the best that life had to offer. Even those without wealth in the labor movement sought a living wage and shorter work hours so they could, as a famous protest song of the time put it, not only have their bread, but the time to enjoy the roses, the fruits of their labor. Ironically, it was only when Henry Ford took the wildly controversial step of shuttering his automobile manufacturing factories on Saturday and cutting daily work hours from the then-standard 12 to 8 that workers began not only enjoying leisure time at home, but became more efficient and productive at work. Though his fellow captains of industry screamed in protest, Ford had based the decision on his own in-house research of how far he could push manual laborers before they became so exhausted or resentful that they'd begin making costly mistakes. Within a few years, the Ford way became the industry standard, and thus was born the 40-hour work week. Economists, too, began making rosy predictions of a coming age of abundant leisure. Keynes thought that by 2030, we'd be working a 15-hour work week, and all would have time to enjoy ""the hour and the day virtuously and well."" Others predicted a 22-hour work week, six-month work year or a standard retirement age of 38. If anything, thinkers at the time worried about what the masses would do to occupy themselves with so much free time on their hands. The predictions seem ludicrous now. In the United States, white-collar workers work longer and more extreme hours than their peers in just about any other advanced economy, save South Korea, where the Wall Street Journal has reported overworked Koreans are checking themselves into prison-like meditation retreats just to get away from it all, and Japan, where they've even coined a word for death from overwork: karoshi. (No one leaves until the boss leaves. And the boss never leaves.) Workers in the United States give up among the most vacation days. We are the only advanced economy with no national vacation policy ( see how we stack up in the chart below). And technology has enabled not just flexible work, but for work to seep into every corner, every hour and every minute of the day. The 40-hour work week of Ford's legacy can seem like a cruel dream -- the labor policy that later enshrined it, the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, now perversely gives businesses incentive to work salaried workers to the point of burnout, and to keep hourly workers' hours artificially low to avoid paying benefits or overtime. Salaried workers have too little leisure time that they can choose and control, what leisure scholars say is the essence of pure leisure. And hourly workers, too much. Though without either choice or control, those blank, unfilled hours of insecurity and gnawing anxiety can hardly be called leisure. Just as with income inequality, our experience of work and leisure is increasingly diverging. As millions of Americans remained sidelined from the economy, working far less than they'd like, and for a minimum wage that in no major city in the country could cover the cost of a two-bedroom apartment, others wear long work hours like a badge of honor. Economists have found that our workplaces reward employees by how long they sit at their desks in the office, not for what they do. Leisure is seen as unproductive at best, and frivolous or a waste of time at worst. And that's not just stupid, it's dangerous. We need to build an economy that creates enough work at fair wages for everyone. And we need to recapture our lost leisure. Those two aspirations can work together. In a knowledge economy, our strength comes from the power of our ideas. And we are wired for those ideas and inspiration to hit in quiet moments of -- leisure. Psychologists John Kounios and Mark Beeman have mapped brain waves and found the ""a-ha"" moment comes in a calm, relaxed state, when we are doing anything BUT work -- like when physicist Richard Feynman idly watched students goofing off spinning plates in the cafeteria and began making calculations of the wobbles, ""for the fun of it,"" which led to his developing the ""Feynman diagrams"" to explain quantum electrodynamics and ultimately resulted in his Nobel Prize. Neuroscience is finding that when we are idle, in leisure, our brains are most active, the Default Mode Network lights up, which, like airport hubs, connect parts of our brain that don't typically communicate. So a stray thought, a random memory, an image can combine in novel ways to produce novel ideas. Anders Ericsson studied elite musicians at the Berlin Academy of Music and is credited with the now wildly popular notion that it takes 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to master anything. But the key that separated the truly great from the good and the adequate was the way they spent those 10,000 hours: they practiced intensely, first thing in the morning when they were freshest, for no more than 60 to 90 minutes at a time, and they rested more. In other words, like brain waves, like heart beats, they worked in short bursts and recovered in leisure and became excellent at what they did. But perhaps the most compelling case for leisure is this: despite our overwork culture, we have a lot of butt-in-chair presenteeism, sick, unhappy, burned out and disengaged workers. We work long hours, but we do not necessarily work productive, efficient or creative hours. Some years, international comparisons of GDP per hours worked have found, workers in Norway, Ireland, Denmark and even France, with their 30 days of paid vacation every year, their café culture, their generous paid family leave policies, their short work hours mandated by law and their new directive forbidding some employers from expecting workers to check work-related texts and emails after hours, beat us by a mile. As we think about the next American economy, we need to consider policies, as well as cultural shifts, that respect that people need time, especially relaxed and personal time, every bit as much as they need money. By dialing down on overwork, by once again matching wages, which have been stagnating, to productivity, which has been rising, we might not only be able to create more work for those who need it, and work smarter, but foster the creativity and innovation that will lead to a more dynamic, productive economy, and a better life. After all, isn't the pursuit of happiness part of what defines us as Americans?","In the United States, white-collar workers work longer than peers in most advanced countries .

The absence of well-known U.S. officials has put the Obama administration on defense, with Secretary of State John Kerry calling criticism of the decision ""quibbling"" on Sunday.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris attending a summit on fighting terrorism, but he was also nowhere to be seen at the march. Rubio, who's releasing a new book ""American Dreams"" as he considers a presidential bid, said he understands why President Barack Obama did not attend, arguing that his security detail could become ""disruptive"" at an event like the rally. But he suggested Holder or Kerry should have gone. ""There are a plethora of people they could have sent,"" he said. ""I think in hindsight, I would hope that they would do it differently."" Jake Tapper: I'm ashamed by U.S. leaders' absence in Paris . In an opinion piece for TIME, Cruz, R-Texas,  wrote that the absence is ""symbolic of the lack of American leadership on the world stage."" ""Our President should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies,"" he said. Neither Cruz nor Rubio explained why they didn't try to attend, themselves. French President FranÃ§ois Hollande's office defended Obama. A senior official told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the U.S. president has been ""very present"" since the attacks, noting that he was one of the first leaders to call Hollande last Wednesday. The official also pointed to Obama's visit to the French Embassy in Washington last week. ""For us It was an emotional moment of solidarity,"" the official said.","Sen. Marco Rubio criticized the absence of top-tier U.S. officials at the Paris rally .

"A winter storm swept through much of the Northeast Monday, creating slick roads, snarling air travel and stranding thousands of fans trying to head home after the Super Bowl. Slushy, wet snow is falling in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Some areas could get 10 inches of snow or more. ""The Northeast faces a triple threat this week, "" said Dave Hennen, CNN's senior meteorologist. ""Monday's storm is just a preview of things to come. Expect another round of winter weather Tuesday, and perhaps a bigger storm over the weekend into early next week."" The storm had dumped six inches of snow in New York City by midday Monday, Hennen said. With temperatures dipping below freezing Monday night, that could lead to an icy glaze on city streets and sidewalks, he said. The situation is so bad in New Jersey that Gov. Chris Christie has declared a state of emergency. ""Today's winter storm is expected to produce heavy snow and travel hazards throughout the state, affecting tonight's evening commute,"" the governor said in a statement. He urged people to remain off the roads so that first responders and public safety officials could respond to any emergency situations. At a news conference Monday afternoon, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also urged people to stay off the streets. ""Things are going to be messy today,"" de Blasio said. ""Snow is coming down faster than we can plow it ... we have a very aggressive plowing operation going on, but the snow is coming down very rapidly."" He said the Big Apple is buckling down and preparing aggressively for the three storms expected this week. There has been one weather-related death in New York. An elderly man was hit by a backhoe pushing snow in front of his Brooklyn home Monday, New York police officials said. The  73-year-old victim was rushed to hospital where he later died, police said. A winter warning is also in effect for Philadelphia, according to the National Weather Service. Boston is under a winter storm watch Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Brutal weather impacts air travel . The wintry weather grounded air travel just a day after the Super Bowl brought people from across the country to the Northeast. By 5 p.m. ET Monday, more than 1,900 flights had been canceled within, into or out of the United States, according to FlightAware.com, an online site that tracks flight data. More than 6,000 flights were delayed. The majority of those cancellations have come from LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International, and Philadelphia International airports. ""Monday morning is one of the busiest times for air travel -- business travelers pack flights as they start the week,""  Daniel Baker, FlightAware's chief executive officer, wrote via e-mail. ""With tens of thousands of Super Bowl fans planning to return home on Monday, there's not a lot of available seats to accommodate everyone who was displaced in the wave of canceled flights this morning."" Newark, John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports are preparing cots and pillows for travelers who may need them overnight, according to Cheryl Albiez, spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates all three airports. Francois Emond, of Alma, Quebec, arrived at Newark airport at 6 a.m. Monday to find his flight home had been canceled. Wearing a Seahawks championship hat and an ear-to-ear smile, he told CNN affiliate WABC that he didn't care about the cancellation or the weather in light of Seattle's victory. ""The night will be very short,"" Emond said. ""When you win a Super Bowl for the first time, the night is very, very short."" He planned to spend an extra night at his hotel in New York. Hotel operators in the city said they are bracing for a lot of last-minute bookings as guests come back from airports. Many hotels report that guests are extending their stays. This is the second wintry blast this year for the Northeast. Last month, extreme cold, strong winds and snow pummeled communities from New York to Massachusetts to Maine. And it's not just the Northeast bracing for winter weather. In the Midwest, an ice storm and significant snow are expected to hit cities such as Oklahoma City, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago and Detroit between Monday and Wednesday. ""The month of January was the third-snowiest for Chicago,"" said CNN meteorologist Hennen, adding the area was deluged with 33.7 inches of snow. ""If you go back the last 50 days, it's literally snowed every other day in Chicago."" The weather is living up to Punxsutawney Phil's predictions. The famed groundhog in Pennsylvania saw his shadow Sunday, on Groundhog Day. If you believe him, that means six more weeks of wintry weather.","More than 1,900 flights have been canceled .

"Ottawa (CNN)Canadian counterterrorism officials arrested and charged a man Monday, accusing him of conspiring with twin brothers in a terror plot. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced Monday that it had arrested Suliman Mohamed, 21, and charged him with participating in the activity of a terrorist group and conspiracy to participate in a terrorist activity. After making the arrest, Canada's national security team said in a statement that Mohamed's arrest was directly linked to the arrests of Ashton and Carlos Larmond, two Ottawa brothers accused of conspiring to commit terrorism offenses. The brothers were arrested Friday. The RCMP alleged Mohamed conspired to participate in terrorism with the Larmond brothers. ""These recent arrests underscore the reality that there are individuals in Ontario and in Canada who have become radicalized to a violent ideology, and who are willing to act upon it,"" wrote Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan, criminal operations officer for the Ontario Division of the RCMP. After an investigation dating back to at least August 2014, the Larmond brothers, both 24, were arrested Friday in two different locations.  Ashton Larmond was arrested in Ottawa, but his brother Carlos was arrested at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, where police said he was intending to travel overseas for terrorist purposes. Carlos Larmond was charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group and with attempting to leave Canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad, a relatively new Canadian terrorism law. Through their lawyer, the brothers indicated they would be fighting the charges. The RCMP statement did not give details of allegations against the suspects. ""I don't think we've been shown anything at this point,"" said Richard Addelman, the lawyer representing the Larmonds. It was not clear Monday night if Mohamed had retained an attorney. Canada's terrorism laws were amended in April 2013 to include an offense for anyone leaving or attempting to leave Canada for the purpose of committing a terrorist act abroad. Very few Canadians have been charged in this way and the outcome of this case will be closely watched by counterterrorism officials. ""It's going to be a significant case, that's for sure,"" added Addelman. Neighbors in an east Ottawa neighborhood where Mohamed has lived said they did not immediately recognize him but indicated there had been police activity on the street all weekend long.

"(CNN)For 10 days following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, two CNN colleagues and I lived in a tent hospital run by Project Medishare. Our hearts ached as we heard the cries of the injured, as we watched surgeons performed amputations without general anesthesia, as people died in front of our eyes. But, in the midst of this despair, a miracle arrived at Project Medishare. CNN Senior Photographer Ferre Dollar caught these images seconds after she arrived. Look closely at the center of the photo. This 4-month-old baby had spent four days alone in the rubble and was unconscious and extremely dehydrated. No one knew if she would live or die. But look at her now! CNN medical producer John Bonifield and I had the pure joy of seeing this wonderful young lady again last week. Her name is Jenny, and she's 5 years old and a pre-kindergartner in Miami. She can write her name and loves to color and dress up as a princess and is adorable and spunky and smart and funny. Here are all the miracles that it took to save her life: . 1. That someone happened to find Jenny in the rubble four days after the quake. 2. That at a time when vehicles were in short supply, Jenny's rescuers flagged down a car to rush her to the hospital. 3. That the Medishare team of doctors and nurses, led by Dr. Karen Schneider, an emergency medicine physician at Johns Hopkins, managed to get fluids into her. Jenny was so dehydrated her veins had collapsed and Schneider had to put a needle through her shinbone and directly into her bone marrow to deliver fluids. They didn't have to sedate her -- Jenny was so unconscious she didn't even cry. Here's Schneider reunited with Jenny a year after her rescue. 4. That Project Medishare found a flight headed immediately to Miami, because she needed surgery the tent hospital couldn't provide. Hospital workers flagged down a UN truck and promised the driver they'd name the baby after her if she got the airport on time. 5. That the baby, then named Patricia after the truck driver, survived the flight to Miami and the emergency surgery. When the baby arrived in Miami, it was presumed her parents were dead. She'd been found in the rubble next to the body of a woman, thought to be her mother. But that woman turned out to be her baby sitter. Shortly after the baby arrived in Miami, a couple came forward saying they were her parents. Many people doubted them, thinking they just wanted to get to Miami, but DNA testing showed they were telling the truth and the baby's name was actually Jenny. Now Jenny and her parents, Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis, and her 17-month-old little sister, Naima, live in an apartment in North Miami. Her parents have explained to Jenny that the bumpy scars on her left arm are from when she was crushed in the rubble of the Haiti earthquake. They've told her she's a miracle, that Jesus saved her. Jenny nods her head and says she understands. But really she's a little embarrassed by all the attention and just wants to go put on her Cinderella dress and go outside and ride her bike and then draw pictures of big red flowers under a sun and sign her name: .

"Over the weekend on his trip to Indonesia, Secretary of State John Kerry implored the global community to take action on climate change, calling it ""the greatest challenge of our generation.""  Speaking to  students, he underscored what we all know to be true: that climate change is an undeniable fact and a danger that we can no longer afford to ignore. Around the globe, President Obama and his chief diplomat are pressing for urgent action to combat the effects of climate change and reduce carbon pollution before we pass the point of no return. But the decision that will either solidify or irrevocably weaken Obama's legacy as a leader on climate change lies much closer to home in the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would pump heavy tar sands crude through America's heartland. The world was watching in June when the President drew a line in the sand during his speech at Georgetown, where he declared that the Keystone XL pipeline would be approved only if ""the project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution."" Today, the world is still watching, and if President Obama is to remain a global climate leader, his choice is clear. Keystone XL fails the President's climate test, and he must reject it. If approved, Keystone XL will unlock the Alberta tar sands, spur investment in and production of dirty fossil fuels at an irreversible rate and undermine the President's global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. And while the flawed Final Environmental Impact Statement released by the State Department last month was touted by TransCanada Corp. as proof that the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially increase carbon emissions, substantial oversights and serious questions about the report's integrity mean this question is far from resolved. Oil industry apologists insist that the Keystone XL pipeline will not have an impact on carbon pollution, because without it, the tar sands would come out of the ground anyway.  But the oil industry has acknowledged that it needs additional pipeline capacity to keep up with increasing production. A report by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers predicts that existing pipelines will be full by the end of 2014. And Keystone XL, which would transport up to 830,000 barrels per day, is only part of the solution. To meet its aggressive 2030 production goals, the industry would need all five of its proposed pipeline projects and then would still fall short. Others claim that rail is a viable alternative to pipelines and that the tar sands will be developed with or without new pipeline capacity. But they are ignoring key facts. Industry and Canadian officials have conceded that rail is not a substitute for Keystone XL in terms of capacity. Not only that, rail is significantly more expensive. The State Department estimates that shipping tar sands by pipeline costs about $8 to $10 per barrel. Make the switch to rail, and the price shoots up to $15 to $17 per barrel, with some estimates as high as $31. For investors, that means rail is only a short-term solution to get the tar sands to market, not a long-term economical alternative to new pipelines. The truth is, the oil industry needs to build a pipeline straight through the United States to access refineries on the Gulf Coast, which allows tar sands oil to be sold at higher world market prices. Keystone XL means producers' profit margins go up, and we're locked into an endless cycle of investment, production and pollution. At the end of the day, Keystone XL is not just another oil pipeline; it's a gateway to the unchecked development of one of the world's dirtiest fossil fuels. Secretary Kerry was right: Climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation, and it is our responsibility to preserve our planet for generations to come.  But America cannot lead the fight on climate change abroad while allowing even more pollution to be produced in our own backyard.  To truly be a global leader on climate change, President Obama must first make the right choices here at home. He must deny the Keystone XL pipeline.","Tom Steyer: Secretary Kerry rightly called climate change one of our greatest challenges .

"A JetBlue pilot has been charged with interfering with a flight crew after his midair behavioral meltdown led to an emergency landing. The federal criminal complaint reveals details of the incident in which Clayton Osbon, 49, displayed what passengers and fellow crew members described as erratic, bizarre and disturbing behavior. Osbon has been suspended pending an investigation and is receiving medical treatment, the airline said Wednesday. If convicted, Osbon would face a maximum 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  The U.S. Attorney's office has 30 days to present the matter to a grand jury for indictment. Read the criminal complaint . In the two-page affidavit in support of an arrest warrant, FBI Special Agent John Whitworth said  Osbon missed the crew briefing for Flight 191, which departed at 7:28 a.m. Tuesday from New York's Kennedy International Airport en route to Las Vegas. ""Initially, he did not exhibit any bizarre behavior,"" Whitworth said in the affidavit, which describes behavior that grew more erratic as the flight continued. The affidavit details the trip: . As the plane was taking off, Osbon ""said something to the FO (first officer) about being evaluated by someone,"" but the first officer was not sure what Osbon meant. Osbon talked about his church and needing to ""focus,"" then asked the first officer to take over the controls and the radio. Osbon said, ""Things just don't matter,"" talked about sins in Las Vegas, and at one point said, ""We're not going to Vegas."" About 3½ hours into the planned five-hour flight, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew. He then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom. By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside. From the cabin, Osbon tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit ""and he banged on the door hard enough that the FO thought he was coming through the door."" But the door held and, over the PA, the first officer ordered passengers to restrain Osbon. Several did just that, subduing the pilot in the forward galley. During the melee, a flight attendant suffered bruised ribs. A passenger said Osbon said, ""Pray f***ing now for Jesus Christ"" and mumbled about Jesus, September 11, Iraq, Iran and terrorists. How are flight crews screened? ""The pilot ran to the cockpit door, began banging on it and said something to the effect of, 'We've gotta pull the throttle back. We've gotta get this plane down,'"" said passenger Laurie Dhue, a former CNN anchor. ""At that point, the two flight attendants tried to subdue him, and then -- seemingly out of nowhere -- about six or seven large guys stormed to the front of the plane and wrestled the captain of the plane down to the ground and had him subdued in a matter of moments,"" she said. ""It was really like something out of a movie."" Amateur video of the incident showed a commotion as men moved through the aisle. A voice, purportedly that of the pilot, can be heard. ""Oh my God. I'm so distraught!"" he shouts. ""We've got Israel, we've got Iraq, we've got Israel, we've got Iraq! We've got to get down!"" Law enforcement met the aircraft, cuffed the pilot and took him off the plane. If that description of Osbon's behavior is correct, ""this guy was clearly psychotic,"" said Dr. William Sledge, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine who has not treated Osbon. ""That has all the earmarks of an acute psychotic episode. I wouldn't hesitate to make that statement."" Psychosis is an automatic disqualification from flying, said Sledge, who is himself a pilot, was a flight surgeon at the School of Aerospace Medicine and has consulted for the Federal Aviation Administration, the Airline Pilots Association and a number of airlines. Cases of psychosis among pilots are unusual, but not rare, and can be career-ending, he said. ""Pretty much, their career is done, most of them,"" he said. ""It's a lifetime disqualification for obvious reasons ... you have to be able to trust each other and you have to be able to trust that the airman is going to be able to perform in a reasonable way."" Passenger Tony Antolino praised the co-pilot. ""He really, I think, is the hero here because he had the sense to recognize that something was going horribly wrong, and he was able to persuade the pilot out of the cockpit,"" he said. The first officer declared an emergency and the plane landed at about 11 a.m. in Amarillo, Texas. Passengers restraining Osbon continued to do so during the landing. Osbon, who has worked as a JetBlue pilot for 12 years, has been taken off active duty with pay, said airline spokeswoman Tamara Young. CEO Dave Barger said Osbon had always been a ""consummate professional."" ""What happened at altitude is we had a medical situation,"" Barger told NBC News.  ""It became a security situation."" Barger said the captain was in custody of the FBI. Citing privacy  concerns, JetBlue would not divulge details about his treatment. Osbon has not made a public statement. The Twitter page for a Clayton F. Osbon describes him as ""JetBlue Flight Standards Captain"" for the Airbus A320, as well as a leadership coach. Tuesday's Flight 191 from New York to Las Vegas was on an Airbus A320. Both the Twitter and LinkedIn pages in Osbon's name describe him as a director of Body By Vi.  The LinkedIn page says the company helps ""people to a better life"" through health and financial prosperity. A Facebook page for a Clayton Osbon says he is married and lives in Savannah, Georgia. The blog Writer Killing Darlings carries a profile of Osbon, which was published last year in the magazine Richmond Hill Reflections.  ""Clayton lives with his wife of six years, Connye, and enough animals to make a lint-brush essential,"" the story says. Osbon ""wants to be a motivational speaker down the road,"" the story says. ""It starts with a greater enhanced knowledge of one's being... you know, I'd like to think the world is more than just getting up in the morning, making a cup of coffee, going to work, coming home, kissing your wife good-night and going to bed,"" it quotes him as saying. ""I was surprised, to say the least,"" Christine Lucas, who wrote the profile, said about her reaction when she heard the news Tuesday. She said she had met with the pilot three times in preparing to write the story and that he gave no indication that anything was amiss. ""He was fantastic, and I believe he probably still is. I'm as eager as everybody else to figure out what happened. But he was a gregarious guy, he was confident and he seemed happy. I can't say that anything led me to think that something like this would happen.""","""Pretty much, their career is done,"" psychiatrist says about psychotic episodes among pilots .

"(CNN) -- It's been a World Cup notable for late drama in most of the matches and a high number of goals scored, particularly in the preliminary stages. New heroes like James Rodriguez of Colombia have also emerged, while modern technology has been introduced for the first time to decide if the ball has crossed the goal line. But for some, the real star of Brazil 2014 comes in a small spray can, a ""magic foam"" which allows referees to make sure players retreat the requisite 10 yards (9.15 meters) when a free kick is awarded against them. Referees have been brandishing the spray with flourish, pacing out the distance then marking it with a line of the spray, over which they can see if a player has edged too close to the taker of the free kick. It has also been used to mark the exact location of a free kick, stopping players from gaining an advantage by edging forwards nearer the goal. Due to its properties of butane, isobutane, propane gas, water and other chemicals, the line on the pitch made by the spray quickly disappears. It is also environmentally friendly as it is biodegradable and doesn't damage the pitch of the atmosphere. ""It is very good,"" FIFA president Sepp Blatter said of the spray's impact. ""It disciplines the players. ""It gives the attacking teams the chance to take the free kick from the real distance, not from where the wall is always moving. ""Some players have said now we have nine meters but in our leagues we have six or seven meters."" The brainchild of a former amateur player from Brazil, with a German-sounding name, Heine Allemagne, it was used as first used as far back as 2000 in a junior football tournament in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. The spray was then known as ""Spuni,"" but after Allemagne joined forces in 2006 with an Argentine, journalist Pablo Silva, to refine the product, it has been renamed ""9.15 Fair Play."" The big breakthrough for the spray came in 2012, when the IFAB (the law-making body of the game) authorized the product for international use. FIFA tested the spray in 2013 at its Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups and gave the go-ahead for this year's senior showpiece soon after. ""It is literally a dream come true to see 9.15 Fair Play being used at this World Cup and seen by billions of people across the globe,"" said Allemagne. Judging by its success, with statistics pointing to more goals coming from free kicks and less time needed to take them, the little spray cans are set to be a permanent addition to the back pockets of referees for many years to come.","Special spray to mark out distances at free kicks being used in World Cup .

"An Egyptian court has sentenced the leader of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood and hundreds of supporters to death, state television said Monday. Intensifying a crackdown on the Islamist movement ahead of elections next month, the same court also handed down a final capital punishment ruling for 37 others. Charges in both cases, which were tried by the same judge, are related to violent riots in the central Egyptian city of Minya in August. A police officer was killed during the violence, which followed a deadly crackdown by security forces on two Cairo sit-ins being held by supporters of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsy, who was ousted last July. Mohammed Badie, the Brotherhood's leader, is among 683 supporters of Morsy whose death sentences are not final -- as the case has been referred to the nation's grand mufti, Egypt's highest religious authority, for review. The official website of the Muslim Brotherhood said Morsy's son, Osama, attended Monday's court session. It quoted him for Badie's reaction after the death sentence was read out. ""If they hung us a thousand times God will never detract from what it is right,"" Badie reportedly shouted. ""We will not tremble because death in the name of Allah is faith. May Allah accept."" In the second case, relating to 529 Muslim Brotherhood supporters sentenced to death last month, the judge upheld 37 death sentences. The others saw their sentences commuted to life in prison. Most of the people sentenced are being tried in absentia. All defendants are still permitted to appeal. The sentences ""put an end to the myth of independence of the judiciary"" and ""are solely based on direct orders from the coup masterminds who deposed the legitimate elected President for personal interests,"" said Gamal Heshmat, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Shura Council -- its highest advisory body.  ""There is no justice, no legal system in Egypt any more. Lawsuits are now turned into political battles, where the ruler seeks revenge against honorable patriotic citizens. ""These judgments are worthless,"" he said in a written statement. ""We will not be intimidated. We will not abandon the Revolution raging in the street, and which assures the whole world that there is no justice in Egypt."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""is alarmed by the news"" of the mass death sentence, his spokesman said.  ""Verdicts that clearly appear not to meet basic fair trial standards, particularly those which impose the death penalty, are likely to undermine prospects for long-term stability,"" which is ""essential for the overall stability of the entire North Africa and Middle East region."" Ban is ""concerned"" about the case and ""intends to discuss these concerns and other issues with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt Nabil Fahmy later this week,"" the spokesman said. In an early reaction from a Western government, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt wrote on Twitter that the mass trials were an ""outrage."" ""The world must and will react!"" he said. The mass trials have already drawn widespread criticism from international human rights groups. Internal strife . Egypt has faced turmoil since the uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Since the army removed Morsy, the country's first freely elected leader, from power last July, Egypt has suffered the worst internal strife in its modern history. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up soon after his removal from office. Cairo's military-installed government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist group, an allegation it denies. The Brotherhood insists it remains an entirely peaceful organization, but it is accused of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on the police and military. A separate militant group, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, has been blamed for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. It claimed responsibility in January for four blasts that killed at least six people in and around Cairo. Authorities also extended a crackdown to secular activists. A Cairo court ordered a ban on all activities of the secular pro-democracy April 6 Youth Movement on charges of espionage and defaming the state, state media reported. The Cairo Court of Urgent Matters also ordered the seizure of the group's premises. The movement helped ignite the uprising that toppled Mubarak. The ruling can still be appealed. In a response to the court decision, the group said its activities were peaceful. ""April 6 is an important part of this generation's voice and dream,"" it said in a statement posted on its Facebook page.  ""We will continue our activities, expressing our opinions, and raising our voice as we please."" The Muslim Brotherhood's London office issued a statement slamming the sentencing of its protesters to death as well as the Cairo court's ban of the youth movement. ""Today's unprecedented verdicts represent a complete disregard of Egyptian and international human rights laws and due process,"" the statement said.  ""The world can longer afford to stay silent on such gross human rights violations and injustice committed by the military junta in Egypt against its own people.

"A tiny device that can recharge cell phone batteries in as little as 30 seconds won 18-year-old Eesha Khare a major science award that will help fund her college education at Harvard University. Khare traveled from her California home to Phoenix last week for the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, where her invention was honored as one of two winners of Young Scientist Awards. ""I'm in a daze. I can't believe this happened,"" Khare, a senior at Lynbrook High School in Saratoga, told CNN affiliate KPIX 5. Khare's device, a black, rectangular type of supercapacitor just over an inch long, can charge a cell phone battery in 20 to 30 seconds, she said. ""I developed a new supercapacitor, which is basically an energy storage device which can hold a lot of energy in a small amount of volume,"" she told KPIX 5. The technology may also be able to speed up charging of automobile batteries, she said. A videotape of the award ceremony showed an ecstatic Khare trotting up to the stage when her name was announced in Phoenix, then standing with other winners as the audience at the fair applauded and confetti fell on them. The award includes a $50,000 prize that will come in handy when Khare heads to Harvard in the fall, she told KPIX 5. With a laugh, she predicted that ""I will be setting the world on fire."" In announcing the winners of what it billed as the ""world's largest high school research competition,"" Intel cited Khare for recognizing ""the crucial need for energy-efficient storage devices"" as the world rapidly adopts portable electronics. The other winner of a Young Scientist Award with Khare was Henry Lin of Shreveport, Louisiana, who received a $50,000 prize for ""simulating thousands of clusters of galaxies"" to allow scientists to ""better understand the mysteries of astrophysics: dark matter, dark energy and the balance of heating and cooling in the universe's most massive objects,"" the Intel statement said. The top prize at the fair went to 19-year-old Ionut Budisteanu of Romania, who used ""artificial intelligence to create a viable model for a low-cost, self-driving car,"" according to an Intel statement.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Despite international pressure, Iran said Tuesday that it rejects Brazil's offer of asylum for an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva proposed Saturday to give sanctuary to Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, whose case has garnered global attention. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Lula lacked sufficient information about the case, the state news agency Agencia Brasil said. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and was originally sentenced to death by stoning. Iranian authorities say the sentence has been put on hold, but there have been no reports as to whether a new sentence has been imposed. Meanwhile, a human rights activist who has taken up Ashtiani's case penned a letter to Lula, saying that his offer was an ""important step"" in saving Ashtiani from undue punishment. Mina Ahadi of the International Committee against Stoning said the campaign to save Ashtiani's life will continue. She said she hopes Brazil and other governments will keep up pressure on the Islamic regime in Tehran, which she said rules through fear and punishment and should not be recognized by the international community. ""Allow me, as a representative of the oppressed people in Iran, to say that I not only want to save Sakineh and abolish stoning, but that I also ask all heads of state not to recognise the Islamic regime as the representative of the Iranian people but to see it as the murderer of people in Iran,"" Ahadi wrote in her letter to Lula. Brazil's relations with Iran have improved in recent years and it recently participated in talks with Tehran aimed at restarting negotiations about Iran's nuclear program. In May, Brazil helped broker a deal with Iran that would provide the government with enriched uranium for medical research. Ashtiani, a 43-year-old mother of two, is reportedly still being held in Tabriz prison. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. Ashtiani's attorney, Mohammad Mostafaei, has gone into hiding since last weekend after being interrogated by Iranian authorities, human rights groups say. Advocates and Mostafaei say his wife and brother-in-law are being held by Iranian authorities.","Brazil's president offered to save Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's life .

"(CNN)The Tuskegee Airmen -- the proud, pioneering group of World War II African-American fighter pilots and service personnel -- lost two more members last week. Clarence Huntley Jr. and Joseph Shambrey both died in Los Angeles on January 5. Their deaths were confirmed by Craig Huntly, Clarence Huntley's nephew. The two men, who were lifelong friends and born within six weeks of one another, were 91. ""They were friends before they joined the Army,"" said Huntly. (The different spelling is deliberate, he said, a product of family tinkering.) ""They didn't go to school together, but in the black community in Los Angeles, mostly everybody knew everybody."" There are no concise numbers for the total number of Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American military aviators in the U.S. service corps. The group is generally said to consist of anybody who went through the ""Tuskegee Experience,"" the Army Air Corps program established to train African-Americans for the war effort, according to Tuskegee Airmen Inc., a group devoted to the history of the Airmen. Tuskegee's historic love story . ""The Tuskegee Airmen included pilots, navigators, bombardiers, maintenance and support staff, instructors, and all the personnel who kept the planes in the air,"" the group's website states. Famous Airmen include Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who became the Air Force's first black general. Their story was told in the 2012 George Lucas-produced film ""Red Tails."" Ron Brewington, a historian of the Airmen, estimates that there are 200 known survivors left of the Tuskegee Experience, though the number may be higher. There are just 20 left in the Los Angeles chapter; three have died in the past three months, said Brewington. Given that trainees went through the program from 1941 to 1949, it's a safe assumption that any survivors are in their 80s or older today -- and like other World War II veterans, their numbers are dwindling. As of July, about 1 million World War II veterans were still alive, of the 16 million who served. According to the Veterans Administration (PDF), about 400 die every day. ""These guys and gals are in their 90s,"" observed Brad Lang, a leader of the CAF Red Tail Squadron, another organization devoted to spreading the word about the Airmen. Brewington said that one Airman he knows of is 105, the oldest known living Airman. Clarence Huntley trained as a mechanic and was crew chief of a plane called Skipper's Darlin' III. In 2011, he had a chance to sit in the P-51 red-tailed Mustang that the CAF Red Tail Squadron takes across the country, the first time he'd sat in the cockpit of a Mustang in decades, CAF Red Tail's newsletter observed back then. What's more, ""he was wearing the same jacket he wore"" in a 1944 photograph of himself in the plane, the newsletter said. Lang recalls that Huntley had a spring in his step, hopping into the cockpit like a much younger man. Lang flew the plane in to California, where ""Uncle Buddy,"" as Huntley was called, was one of many who visited it. Huntly, the nephew, said his uncle was proud of his service, though ""he didn't talk about it much."" Just 19 when he enlisted, Huntley saw the brutal segregation of Alabama -- much different than the culture he left in Los Angeles -- and the bombing of an Italian airfield where he was stationed. He also saw the 1944 eruption of Mount Vesuvius, the last time that famed volcano blew. He spent his post-military career as a skycap at Los Angeles International and Burbank airports. Shambrey was a supervisor for the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. A call to his son, Timothy, hadn't been returned at publication time. Their example, and that of so many others, is important to acknowledge, said Brewington, who served 22 years in the Navy. ""They made it easier for me, and I'm trying to make it easier for others,"" he said. ""The passing of the Airmen makes our mission all the more important to carry on so their story is not lost but continues to serve as a legacy of inspiration,"" said CAF Red Tail administrator LaVone Kay.

"A commuter train derailed in a curve in the New York borough of the Bronx on Sunday, killing four people and leaving dozens hurt, investigators said. All seven passenger cars and the locomotive jumped the tracks near the Spuyten Duyvil station, about 10 miles north of Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal, the National Transportation Safety Board reported. Three of the dead were thrown out of the train as it ""came off the track and was twisting and turning,"" New York Fire Department Chief Edward Kilduff told reporters. Surviving passenger Amanda Swanson told CNN the windows of the coaches broke out, and ""the gravel came flying up in our faces."" ""I really didn't know if I would survive,"" said Swanson, who put her bag in front of her face to block the rubble. ""The train felt like it was on its side and dragging for a long time. ... The whole thing felt like slow motion."" The train was en route to Grand Central from Poughkeepsie, 74 miles up the Hudson River, when it derailed about 7:20 a.m., NTSB member Earl Weener said Sunday. At least 67 people were injured, said Joe Bruno, New York's commissioner of emergency management, and 11 remained in critical condition Sunday evening, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters. The diesel locomotive was pushing passenger cars through a 30-mph curve north of the station at the time of the crash, Weener said. He said that configuration is one of many things investigators will be examining as they try to determine the cause of the wreck. Investigators have recovered an event recorder from the locomotive and another car but haven't yet examined them, Weener said. ""Our mission is to understand not just what happened, but why it happened, with the intent of preventing it from ever happening again,"" he said. About 150 people were on the train when it derailed, said Laureen Coyne, director of risk management for New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority, which includes the Metro-North railroad. One car came to rest just feet away from the Harlem River. ""I heard this horrible, whooshing sound. ... It was very disturbing, very loud,"" said Hank Goldman, who lives near the tracks. ""I jumped out of bed and looked out the window and I saw a light-colored object lying down. I thought it was the roadway to the train. Then I got my binoculars, and I couldn't believe my eyes, that the train had jumped the tracks right here."" New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority identified the dead as Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh, New York; James G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring, New York; James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose, New York; and So Kisook Ahn, 35, of Queens, New York. Lovell did freelance audio and was headed into New York to work Sunday morning, said Dave Merandy, a town council member in the Hudson Valley community of Philipstown. ""He loved his family and did what was necessary to keep things afloat with his family. He was a great man,"" said Merandy. Lovell's wife, Nancy Montgomery, sits on Philipstown's council, and Merandy and Lovell were high school classmates, Merandy said. He leaves behind three sons and a daughter from a previous marriage. ""We're just shocked. Completely shocked,"" Merandy said. The Metro-North Hudson Line had a ridership of 15.9 million last year, with hundreds of people riding the packed trains during weekday rush hour, officials said. The train operator -- who is among the injured -- told investigators he applied brakes to the train, but it didn't slow down, a law enforcement official on the scene and familiar with the investigation said. ""That will be a key point of concern, whether this train was moving too quickly,"" Bruno said. A freight train derailed in the same curve in July, damaging about 1,500 feet of track, the MTA reported at the time. Weener said the NTSB would look into whether there was any connection between that derailment and Sunday's crash, but both he and Cuomo discounted the possibility. ""The curve has been here for many, many years, right, and trains take the curve every day, 365 days a year ...  We've always had this configuration. We didn't have accidents,"" Cuomo said. ""So there has to be another factor, and that's what we want to learn from the NTSB."" Investigators will look at the condition of the track, the signal system, crew performance and other factors. They'll also search for data and video recordings that may have captured details tied to the derailment,  NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. ""We've got a lot of work to do,"" she said. ""We don't have a lot of daylight hours to do it, but we're going to do as much as we can."" Passenger: Train stopped with a thud . The incident quickly sparked chatter on Twitter and drew a crowd of onlookers to the scene. Passenger Frank Tatulli told WABC he thought the train was traveling ""a lot faster"" than usual. He escaped a derailed car on his own and had head and neck injuries, he said. Other passengers were still on the train, he told WABC. Another survivor told WABC that she climbed out of a train car that had overturned. Nearby, she said, she heard injured victims moaning and asking for help. ""I almost feel guilty,"" she said. ""I was just in a really safe spot on the train, just the way it fell."" Swanson told CNN the train car she was in came to a stop with a thud. ""I just closed my eyes and kind of hoped to God that I was going to be able to call my mom with decent news,"" Swanson said. She got off the train with her cell phone in hand: ""The screen was shattered, but it still worked,"" she said. Among those hurt, one suffered a spinal cord injury that could leave him paralyzed from the neck down, said Dr. David Listman, director of the emergency department at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. New York-Presbyterian Hospital said it was treating 17 patients, four of whom were in critical condition. Federal authorities are also investigating another Metro-North incident in which two passenger trains crashed during rush hour in Connecticut in May. Though no connection between the incidents has been established, one state lawmaker said Sunday that the derailments are a sign that federal investigators should examine track conditions throughout the region. ""It is important that the entire regional track infrastructure be examined to identify any chronic issues that have led to past derailments or could lead to future derailments in order to ensure the safety of the millions of people who use the trains every single day,"" New York State Sen. Charles J. Fuschillo Jr. said in a statement. Service was suspended Sunday on part of the Hudson Line and won't be resumed until the NTSB finishes documenting the scene and returns the track to the MTA for repairs, Cuomo said. ""I think it's fair to say tomorrow, people who use this line should plan on a long commute or plan on using the Harlem Line,"" Cuomo said. Amtrak trains were suspended between New York and Albany for hours after the derailment. On Sunday afternoon officials said service would resume with restricted speeds in the area. ""Some delays can be expected,"" Amtrak said.","Derailment victim ""did what was necessary"" to help his family, councilman says .

"A video released Wednesday shows members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot being beaten by security officials in Sochi as they tried to film a music video at the port of the city that is hosting the Winter Olympics. The apparent attack happened just a day after band members Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, as well as journalists and Russian human rights activists, were detained for several hours at a police station located just a few miles from the Olympic Park. A YouTube video of the new incident shows band members arriving at the port, surrounded by photographers. The women don ski masks in front of a Sochi 2014 sign and, as they began to perform, one band member is immediately pepper sprayed at close range by a man wearing the traditional headgear of the Cossacks. Some of the women are then struck with a baton before several Cossacks descend on them, shoving and violently removing their ski masks. One of the band members is thrown to the ground by the security men, who also beat a photographer. After the women were beaten and walked away from the port, the security men are seen on the video shoving and beating two other men. The band said it was trying to perform a new song called ""Putin teaches us to love our motherland"" at the main port in Sochi. 'You sold yourselves to the Americans' Uniformed Cossacks in traditional fur hats and uniforms have accompanied Russian police as a colorful addition to the massive security presence around the Winter Games. Tolokonnikova said on her Twitter account that Cossacks beat the band with billy clubs and pepper spray. Aisya Krugovikh, a member of the band's entourage, said that during the altercation, some Cossacks yelled that Pussy Riot members should ""shut their mouths,"" adding ""you sold yourselves to the Americans."" CNN has repeatedly tried to contact Russian city officials by telephone and e-mail for comment on the allegations. Among those apparently wounded in Wednesday's clash was a Russian artist named Alexei Knyebnikovsky, who Krugovikh said was bleeding from the face. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina published photos on their Twitter accounts of bruises on Tolokonnikova's chest and a man with blood on his face ""after an attack by Cossacks."" Tolokonnikova also tweeted she was at a Sochi hospital taking care of her husband, who she wrote had ""lost vision"" due to pepper spray from Cossacks. The previous day, band members were detained by police, who said they were investigating a theft at the hotel where the band was staying. Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova, as well as the journalists and activists, were released without charges, but they said they were beaten while in custody. On Wednesday, Tolokonnikova's husband, Petr Verzilov, told CNN the band had been detained and questioned by Russian security forces three times during a three-day visit to the Olympic city. ""Obviously, they are trying to let us know that we're not welcome here,"" Verzilov said Tuesday in an interview with CNN.  ""But we treat Sochi as part of Russia and according to Russian law any Russian citizen can go anywhere."" In Sochi for protests . The band members were in Sochi to protest what they said was the lack of freedom of speech and to record the music video critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina had been imprisoned for nearly two years after being convicted of ""hooliganism"" and inciting religious hatred for performing a punk song slamming Putin in a Moscow cathedral and then posting a video of it online. Since their release, just before the Olympic Games began, they have spoken to journalists about their time behind bars, describing the conditions as squalid and their treatment by guards as demeaning and inhumane. A third member of Pussy Riot, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released in 2012. This month, other band members said Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were no longer part of the group. But Verzilov said Tuesday that wasn't true.","Video shows men in Cossack uniforms beating, pepper spraying band members .

"Fire up the salt trucks. Shutter schools. Position the National Guard. Two weeks after a few inches of snow paralyzed Atlanta and embarrassed the state, government leaders are tackling the latest round of bad weather with gusto. ""I think we're certainly ahead of the game this time and that's important. We're trying to be ready and prepared and react as quickly as possible,"" Gov. Nathan Deal told reporters Monday. The storm could still turn out to be another ugly mess, but it won't be for lack of trying by state officials.. Deal declared a weather-related state of emergency for 45 counties in the state Monday, well before snow, sleet and rain were expected to hit. Atlanta Public Schools announced the system would be closed Tuesday and Wednesday. And Georgia Power's top emergency official said he'd already started calling in crews from other states to help fix downed power lines -- just in case. Their biggest worry? The threat of a major ice storm Tuesday night. ""When you're talking about the amount of ice we're looking at, it's catastrophic,"" Aaron Strickland, the utility's storm center manager, told reporters. ""What will happen is that the ice will build up on trees, trees will come down and take down the power lines. ... So It is an event that we are extremely fearful of, but we're preparing (by) bringing in outside help at this time."" Snow, sleet and rain are in the forecast from Monday night through Wednesday morning as temperatures plunge to the 30s. By Wednesday, ice on the roads could make driving ""hazardous or impossible,"" forecasters from the National Weather Service warned. The city's northern suburbs could get 1 to 3 inches of snow, with up to 6 inches blanketing the northeast Georgia mountains. A winter storm watch is in effect Monday through Wednesday morning for Atlanta and the watch stretches west to Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee and Little Rock, Arkansas. This storm will be the first test for a 32-member severe weather task force created in Georgia after last month's debacle when 2.6 inches of snow shut down Atlanta's metropolitan area. The governor apologized to the public -- ""I'm the governor, the buck stops with me"" -- and promised to handle things differently next time. Well, it's next time. Governor advises 'extreme caution' Deal told reporters Monday that the state was doing everything it could. ""We are making every effort to be prepared for these events, and I would simply say that we should all individually use extreme caution,"" he said. The Georgia Department of Transportation has said it plans to start treating roads with sand and salt after the Monday evening rush hour. Supplies from southern Georgia are being brought to the Atlanta metro area, said transportation department spokeswoman Natalie Dale. Deal also gave the National Guard a warning order, an advance notice to personnel of the possibility of a ""call up"" for a state mission. Schools also began announcing their plans to cancel evening activities beginning Monday. The city of Atlanta, which got hammered for its lackluster performance the last go-round, is on the storm preps bandwagon, too. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed told reporters that deals with contractors had allowed the city to double the size of its fleet dedicated to pre-treating roads. Priority roads and bridges will be treated Monday night with a combination of sand and salt, and more supplies are being ordered, City Hall spokesman Carlos Campos said. The city urged people to take precautions such as filling cars with gas and stocking up on food. Officials have their fingers crossed that the more coordinated effort will produce better results. When the storm struck January 28, traffic gridlock occurred almost instantaneously as commuters fled Atlanta en masse. Thousands of school children across northern Georgia spent the night in schools, and countless motorists endured 20-plus hour commutes, if they were lucky enough to get home at all. The new plan of attack . Deal and emergency officials took plenty of heat for being slow to respond to or just plain oblivious to storm developments the last time around. The governor and his staff huddled with emergency management, transportation, power company and health officials Monday morning. ""We've included health officials and power companies in our preparations because heavy downfalls of ice can knock out power supply,"" Deal said. ""I want to make sure we're reaching out to health care facilities so they can have backup plans in place."" At a press conference later in the day, the governor urged the driving public to be careful. He spoke at a state Department of Transportation facility that was gearing up for inclement weather. ""It appears that tomorrow is one of those 'iffy' days,"" Deal said. ""But the following day and tomorrow night, going into Wednesday, appears to be the time that we're going to be in most jeopardy of ice forming, either from freezing rain or from sleet itself."" Stocking up . SnowedOutAtlanta, the Facebook group where Georgia residents asked for and offered help during the last storm, was ramping back up Monday. The forum posted alerts about school closings and the possibility of power outages, and tips about how to prepare for the storm. The looming storm brought a mix of shrugs and concern at local supermarkets. ""I got some pasta, some salad fixings and some wine,"" Katie Derrick told CNN affiliate WGCL.  ""You know, in case I'm stuck at home, I'll be well prepared."" Bob Simmons grabbed a few items too. ""I got some can goods and fruit, veggies and a frozen pizza,"" he said.  ""I'm a Yankee so I'm used to this stuff, but I'm getting nervous now.  They keep talking about it."" But is the talk just that, talk?  Not everyone is optimistic that Georgia has learned its lesson. ""We don't learn,"" said one shopper. ""It happened before in 2011 and nothing happened. So, 2014, the same thing.  2017, it's going to happen again and we're going to be stuck at home.""","Georgia's governor says officials are ""ahead of the game this time""

"(CNN)There were a number of grim surprises from the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, including their brutality, the inability of French intelligence to track known jihadis, and now of course the puzzling, indeed incomprehensible, fact that the Obama administration failed to send a high level representative to yesterday's national anti-terror rally in Paris. Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Paris later this week, but that the administration could have been so tone deaf in missing a this weekend's chance to highlight its concerns over an issue critical to Europe and America's own security-- is a stunning oversight. It suggests an inability to see the Paris attacks in their proper perspective -- although doing so is admittedly no easy matter only days afterward. As Washington and others process those events, there are takeaways that should guide their thinking in the period ahead.   They include: . Don't panic . The jihadis aren't taking over the world. After 9/11, many had an overriding sense that more successful attacks would follow. They didn't. In fact both in Europe and the U.S., it's stunning how few successful attacks directed by foreign terrorist organizations there have been (not one since 2005 in Europe; and not one since 9/11 in the U.S.) Last year, there were 17,958 global fatalities to terror, according to the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database. Among them, there were 16 Americans. Almost 82% of the terrorist attacks happened in only five countries: Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan. But don't trivialize . Terrorism emerging from the Arab and Muslim world, along with weapons of mass destruction, may well be to the 21st century what the cold war was to last century: the international community's defining national security challenge. Just look what else occurred over the past week or so: 2,000 people were killed by Boko Haram's savagery. There's no winning the battle against jihadi terror or ""ultimately defeating"" it. A perfect storm of jihadi fantasies driven by hatred and triumphalism, and growing Shia-Sunni divisions, have combined with a dysfunctional Arab world that offers up either no governance or bad governance.  And this will continue to produce alienation, radicalization and violence. The war on jihadi terrorism really is a war; but of a generational character. It will be with us for years to come. We can contain, preempt and try to prevent it. But we cannot hermetically seal our borders or eliminate our vulnerability without undermining and sacrificing our freedoms and way of life . Don't romanticize . The outpouring of goodwill and solidarity that has followed the Paris attacks is an encouraging sign. And if it leads to greater international resolve, more effective security cooperation, smart counter-terrorism and an effort in France -- and in Europe -- to reduce discrimination against Muslims and promote greater acceptance of Jews, it will help contain the jihadi threat. But you don't change a nation in a single traumatic act. 9/11 didn't do it; Newtown didn't; Ferguson didn't. And the Paris attacks won't either.  Anti-Muslim and anti-immigration sentiment, along with the rise of the far right, has been developing for years.  A new tolerance won't come easy. Ironically, the same democratic values and freedom of expression and movement that the West defends will be used by jihadis -- and the alienated Muslim communities on which they feed -- to sustain their radical effort. Don't let Muslims and Arabs off the hook . Arab governments, the Arab League, the head of Al-Azhar University in Cairo and various Muslim clerics have issued statements denouncing the  Paris attacks, and various Arab and Muslim leaders attended yesterday's national rally in Paris. All of this is important.  But let's be clear: . For far too long a disturbing minority of Arabs and Muslims have hijacked a religion in the service of a radical jihad. And as they did this, too many other Muslims have been passive, silent, and acquiescent, failing to condemn them and thus allowing them latitude to operate. Arab governments have sometimes repressed jihadi ideology, but other times -- as in the case of Saudi Arabia, itself a victim of terror-- tried to accommodate it. Or both. Meanwhile anti-Semitic cartoons and tropes routinely circulate in the Arab and Muslim press.  There is an ongoing  struggle within Islam between Sunni and Shia, moderates and  radicals, modernists and traditionalists that is far from being resolved. Islam's reformation is nowhere near at hand. And until there is a clearer separation between religion and the state, better governance, respect for freedom of expression and freedom of conscience, and genuine tolerance and regard for minority rights, radicalism will flourish.  No U.S. narrative or externally generated reform effort can delegitimize the jihadis; only the Muslims themselves can do that. Don't just externalize . The failures of Arab and Muslim governments are to blame for jihadi terror. But there's no doubt that Western policies and practices have made an already bad situation worse.  It is the cruelest of ironies that the U.S.-- the victim of mass terror on 9/11 -- helped enable the jihadis further with its ill-considered and unwise invasion of Iraq. One result was the creation of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Anger toward the West runs deep in this broken and dysfunctional region. U.S. relationships with allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, feed the jihadi narrative,  as do effective counterterrorism methods such as drone strikes that that kill innocents and often and alienate the mainstream Muslims as well. America is in a no-win situation. Whatever else we try to achieve in this broken, angry, and dysfunctional region, our overriding goal must be to prevent attacks on the U.S. and help our allies do the same. What happened in Paris is a tragic reminder of how challenging this will be.","Aaron David Miller: Obama's absence from Paris was tone deaf .
He says one lesson of attack: Don't let Arab, Muslim nations tolerant of jihad off the hook .
Miller: Anger of some in Muslim world at West can't be trivialized. It's challenge of our time ."
"(CNN)Transatlantic passengers taking the JFK to Heathrow red-eye got a helpful boost from stronger-than-average winds, reaching near-supersonic speeds and cutting 90 minutes off the scheduled flight time. The British Airways Boeing 777-200 made the New York-London route in five hours, 16 minutes last Wednesday, and reached ground speeds of up to 1200 km/h (745 mph), riding a powerful jet stream of up to 322 km/h (200 mph) tailwinds. The sonic barrier is broken at 1224 km/h (761 mph). 'Like surfing' Former BA pilot Alastair Rosenschein told the British press that riding the jet stream was ""just like surfing."" ""It's extraordinary how fast you can go,"" the Daily Telegraph quoted him as saying. ""You try to sit in the core of the jet where it's not too turbulent and where you can pick up some free mileage. It's not unusual to get 100 mph tailwinds but (these pilots) have got more than that. This must be a record."" Several other flights heading east over the Atlantic also benefited from the weather, but it was flight BA114 that made headlines with the record time. What is turbulence? Matching Concorde? Not even close . Only the now-retired Concorde, which was operated by BA and Air France until it was decommissioned in 2003, bested Flight 114's New York-London time -- a BA Concorde made that trip in 1996 in just under two hours, 53 minutes. For European passengers traveling westwards, however, the jet stream will mean longer-than-average flight times as planes need to battle powerful headwinds. Gale-force winds affected travel in the UK this week ahead of forecasted heavy snow. Some 40,000 households in Scotland were without power as the power grid went down in the Highlands.","A British Airways flight makes New York - London in record time .

The small airport serving the southwest England port city has emerged as the world's most punctual aviation hub in 2014, outperforming some of the biggest destinations on the planet. With connections to Europe and north Africa, Bristol managed to get 94.4% of its flights on or off the ground within 15 minutes of schedule, according to stats from UK-based aviation data monitors OAG. It's a figure that might discomfit officials at the main airports serving London -- including Europe's busiest at Heathrow (75.5%) -- none of which made the top rankings, with the exception of London Luton. That puts it top of the league not only for small airports, but also larger facilities. John Grant, OAG executive vice president, says the findings of his company's first annual ""Punctuality League"" were positive, although many leading operators would probably be looking to up their game in 2015. ""With many airports and airlines achieving in excess of 90% on-time performance within 15 minutes of schedule there is a lot to celebrate,"" he said. European destinations dominated the timekeeping list when it comes to small airports, with Bristol followed closely by Brussels South Charleroi Airport at 93.1% and Berlin Schoenefeld at 92.3%. Japan's Osaka International Airport claimed the top spot for medium sized airports with 93.2%, followed by Moscow Sheremetyevo (89.8%) and Copenhagen Airport (89.8%). The most punctual large air hub was named as Munich Airport (89%) -- a fact that'll do little to dispel stereotypes of German efficiency, but one that also highlights the five-year delay to Berlin's still unopened Brandenburg Airport. Munich was followed by Tokyo Haneda at 87.9% and Seattle's Sea-Tac Airport at 86.2%. The world's busiest air destination, Atlanta, was ranked 12th on the large airports list with a score of 82.4%. Dubai, at 14th with 82.3%, was the only Middle Eastern airport to make any of the top twenties. In a week when it emerged that passengers spent 28 hours stuck on a delayed flight from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco, OAG's rankings for the world's most punctual airlines makes interesting reading. Smaller operations again took the lead, with Latvia's airBaltic outperforming all others at 94.9%. Second and third were Hawaiian Airlines at 92.3% and Austrian Airlines at 90%. The rest of the top 10 includes: Iberia (89.7%), KLM (89.4%), Saudi Arabian Airlines (89.4%), SAS (89.1%), Japan Airlines (88.8%), Finnair (88.6) and Alaska Airlines (88.5%). Norwegian Air Shuttle was named the most punctual low-cost carrier, with almost nine out of 10 flights sticking to schedule. It was followed by Thai AirAsia and EasyJet.","UK's small Bristol Airport outperforms larger rivals when it comes to timekeeping, according to OAG report .

"The Obama administration will not make a formal determination as to whether the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy by the military was a coup, a senior administration official told CNN's Jill Dougherty on Thursday. A coup determination would force the United States to end military aid to Egypt. ""The law does not require us to make a formal determination as to whether a coup took place and it is not in our national interest to make such a determination,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The administration sees continuing aid to Egypt -- more than $1 billion annually -- to be ""consistent with our law"" and necessary to further U.S. national security interests, the source said. The news, first reported by The Associated Press, came as Egypt braced for rival rallies set for Friday by Morsy's supporters and those who backed his ouster by the military. Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, has not been seen publicly since he was pushed from office by the military on July 3 after mass protests over his leadership and suspended the constitution. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and thousands injured since Morsy's ouster, some of them in confrontations with authorities and others in clashes with those on the other side of the political spectrum. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the head of Egypt's military, has called for mass demonstrations Friday to support the country's armed forces. He is calling the protests a ""mandate"" for the military after weeks of violence that he has blamed on Morsy's supporters, primarily the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, issued its own call for protests. The group has refused to recognize the ouster, saying Morsy is the legitimate president. Al-Sisi warned that any violence ""will be confronted with the resolve and strength"" of the military. ""We call upon various political faction to avoid any act of provocation,"" he said in statement released Thursday. There has been growing concern about among world leaders about the increase in violence since Morsy's ouster. The country is considered a vital regional ally for the United States, which signaled its displeasure with Morsy's ouster on Wednesday when the Pentagon said it was delaying the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets. It's not clear what conditions would be imposed before the aircraft would be cleared for shipment. The Pentagon said, however, that it was not suspending overall arms sales to Egypt at this time.","Egypt is bracing for mass rival rallies on Friday .

"From the rooftop of a mosque in the Cairo district of Nasr City, I watched as thousands of supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy frantically waved posters and chanted angrily. Moments before they heard that the man who, just a year ago, had been declared Egypt's first ever democratically elected president had been ousted. The people who had jammed into Tahrir Square on June 30, 2012 to celebrate his inauguration were shocked and enraged. When long-serving President Hosni Mubarak was toppled from power two and a half years ago, it was the beginning, not the end, of a revolution that has yet to run its course. Prior to 2011, the presumption among many Egyptians and foreign observers alike was that the long-suffering people of Egypt had an almost bottomless reserve of patience, that as long as they could feed their families, they would put up with whoever was in power. The uprising that banished Mubarak unleashed energy and a passion that shows no sign of diminishing. If Morsy thought his election victory a year ago, in which he won 51.7% of the vote, was a mandate, he was sorely mistaken. But Morsy's head never lay steady atop the state. The police never trusted him -- nor did Christians. The army was suspicious and the business community dubious. Many voted for Morsy simply because they saw him as the lesser of two evils, running against former Mubarak stalwart Ahmed Shafiq. One activist I spoke to, who only gave his name as Abdel Hadi, compared the two candidates during the presidential elections. ""You have two drugs,"" he told me. ""One, Ahmed Shafiq kills you, and the other, Morsy, gives you a bad stomach ache. They're both bad, but Morsy's drug is light. It doesn't kill you. So we'll give Morsy four years. If he doesn't work out, we'll come back to Tahrir and bring him down."" Abdel Hadi's words, spoken in June 2012, were prophetic. Analysis: What is Muslim Brotherhood? The night before the massive anti-Morsy demonstrations on June 30, in a packed Tahrir Square, I found people already convinced their president of just one year was soon to be history. ""He's out, he's over, he's finished,"" one man shouted to me. ""We've gone downhill all the way in that year, economically, security wise,"" said Abdal Rahman, a businessman. ""It's over. They've split Egypt in two, Islamists and non-Islamists. We're all Muslims and we're all believers. Our conflict was a political conflict. They're switched it to a religious conflict."" Many Egyptians were deeply offended that Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood put their identity as Muslims before their identity as Egyptians. This is a country profoundly proud of its rich heritage, and quick to take offense at those who seem to disregard its place in history. Last November, many were appalled when a Muslim radical, Morgan Al-Gohary, appeared on talk show on a private TV channel and declared if he and his ilk ever came to power they would destroy some of Egypt's most revered monuments. During the program, he claimed he took part in the demolition of Afghanistan's Bamiyan Buddha statues in March 2001. The show's host, Wael Al-Abrashi asked, ""So you would destroy the sphinx and the pyramids?"" Al-Gohary: ""Yes, we will destroy them, if they were worshiped before or afterwards."" One guest, clearly repulsed, told Al-Gohary, ""You don't know the history of your country well. The pharaohs were the first to know religion in the world."" The Sphinx and the pyramids, he continued, ""are mankind's heritage and not the property of the Egyptians alone, they are the property of all mankind."" Although neither Morsy, nor the Brotherhood, ever advocated such a course of action, many questioned their intentions and accused the Brotherhood of harboring barely concealed intent to turn Egypt into a Taliban-style Islamic state. That was an intangible complaint. Others were more blatant. The economy withered under Morsy, as Egyptians suffered through frequent and prolonged power cuts and fumed in long lines outside petrol stations. Morsy's promises of prosperity and security never materialized. So the people mobilized. The country's powerful army, responding to the millions in the street, forced Morsy from power on the evening of July 3. But in the brave, new Egypt, no one gives up without a fight. The celebrations in Tahrir were mirrored by angry demonstrations outside Cairo Univeristy and in Nasr City. ""No one is going to take our vote,"" a woman shouted to me in front of the university. ""These are legitimate elections,"" exclaimed her husband. ""All the people have approved his legitimacy. He is our legitimate president. How can he [Defense Minister Abdel Fatah Al-Sisi] take this from us?"" Morsy's sudden transformation, from president of the Arab Republic of Egypt, to prisoner, reminded me of something newspaper editor Hani Shukrallah had told me just one year before, on the eve of Morsy's victory. Egyptians, he said, now ""have a sense of their own rights. They have a sense of their personal dignity. They perceive themselves as citizens and this is something that is new for an old guy like me. They look at the state as their servant and not their master."" Morsy, their servant, did a bad job so they fired him. The real revolution in Egypt is not in the streets. It's in the mind.","Wedeman: President Mubarak's removal marked start of revolution yet to run its course .

"After paying five homeless people outside his studio in Manila to help chew 700 pieces of bubble gum, Louie Cordero began to wonder what he had undertaken in the name of art. ""Well, it certainly took longer than I imagined it would, and they thought it would, too"" he recalls. After two days of aching jaws, the potent mix of gum, spittle and resin went to create one of Cordero's larger-than-life sculptures; a bright green figure that is part tribal warrior, part horror flick monster, but all Cordero's imagination. It is now starting to turn brown as the sugar in the gum oxidizes, but Cordero is still turning his wild machinations of surreal, twisted biomorphic figures into sculptures and paintings, and is one of a group of contemporary artists from the Philippines turning heads with a vibrancy and unique Filipino vision. Awash with tubes of bright acrylic paint, Cordero's studio in the Cubao area of Manila has been his main base for around 10 years and is situated just a few minutes away from the stadium where Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier had their ""Thriller in Manila"" bout in 1975. Working on two new pieces for this month's Hong Kong International Art Fair while sipping industrial strength coffee, Cordero admits that while his attitude to his work hasn't really altered in a decade, local artists are seemingly starting to punch above their weight. ""Things have changed a lot in terms of financial gain and artistic gain. For new artists, they have a thing about doing it in the international scene or being represented. Now it's a career that has to be strategized,"" he says. ""In Manila there used to be more artist run galleries. Now big galleries are here and looking for the new artist that wants to sell for big money. Every week now there's like three openings, before it used to be one show per month."" It's a long way from the 34-year-old's life when he graduated from the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts. Back then he couldn't afford paint so spent days drawing comic strips (one of which has gained a cult following in the Philippines and Japan) or taking illustration jobs to pay the bills. Joining with friends and contemporaries he also ran artist spaces for impromptu exhibitions. Since then he's moved on to feature in joint exhibitions in Hong Kong and prominent solo shows including one in New York in 2010. Inspired by an explosive mix of comic art, pop culture and gore-fest films, Cordero also retains a strong Filipino flavor in his art, drawing on everything from jeepney art, turbulent politics and the almost inescapable impact of religion in Philippine society. ""We've been occupied and colonized by American and Spanish so most of the artists here contemplate on that concept or hang-ups from it, especially the Catholic influence that we get from school age upwards,"" he says. Playing with religious imagery can still cause huge controversy in the Philippines. Last year a collage by artist Mideo Cruz at the Cultural Center of the Philippines depicted Jesus with a wooden penis glued to his face. It was condemned  by church groups and even attracted the ire of former first lady Imelda Marcos. The resulting furor led to the exhibition being closed. Cordero admits to gleefully prodding the country's cultural soft spots when he was younger with a 2001 piece that mixed in Jesus and Ronald McDonald, but thinks Cruz was just unlucky. ""He was the center of the whole nation's tensions. When I started I was like that, now I'm not so scandalous with my work; it's more like you're young and full of angst, and you're very idealistic. ""If you're dealing with religion, it's very sad because people, priests and politicians will condemn you if you touch on that sensibility. You can do it, but it can become a circus. ""It's fine if you do it just for art people, but for the common people, still not that many go to art exhibition. You need that sensation for people to go."" If the public's tastes are not so Catholic in the Philippines, art collectors are starting to wake up to the breadth and diversity of work by contemporary Filipino artists. Last month a painting by Filipino artist Ronald Ventura entitled ""Grayground"" sold at Sotheby's in Hong Kong for $1.1 million, making it the first piece by a contemporary Southeast Asian artist to fetch more than $1 million. ""If Ventura's work is going for over $1million, and the likes of (established 19th century painter) Juan Luna couldn't meet its reserve price, there's something going on (in the art market),"" says independent curator and Cordero's partner Isabel Ching. Next door to Cordero's studio is a fabrication workshop run by Jeremy Guiab, where Cordero's latest projects - thrones made of fiberglass bones and twisted totem polls - are being made. A gold mine of curios and industrial oddities, it's also a hub for local artists, from those fresh out of art school to longer-serving artists like Romeo Lee. ""I've been around since the 1980s. Filipinos started in a struggle, now it's the new generation's chance, and they're smart,"" says Lee. ""But for the old generation like me, I'll keep going, and I'm happy if someone now wants to pay more for my art."" With an increasing interest in the work of Cordero and his contemporaries like Nona Garcia and predecessors like Manuel Ocampo, has come a desire from collectors to know where they come from, says Magnus Renfrew, director of Hong Kong International Art Fair, . ""It's relatively early days for the international profile of art from the Philippines,"" says Renfrew. ""But it is becoming more and more the case that collectors are willing to engage with artists from a wide variety of cultural and aesthetic backgrounds."" Among the sparks of spot-welding and smell of resin in the workshop, Cordero is content to continue to mix things up in his own work regardless of the changing tastes of collectors or galleries. ""I don't know what I'm doing; it's the challenge. That's the reason I do art: to keep challenging myself and saying this is what I want to do.""","Manila-based artists finding their feet on the international stage .

"(CNN)In the gentle yet fiercely warm surrounds of the southern Ugandan countryside, Mwanja Banuli looks on as farmhands fill his truck with sugar cane. Packing this rough, woody crop is heavy going and making sure every inch of space is utilized is key. Transport costs money, after all, and this humble sugar farmer has lots of costs to consider. ""There are many challenges in this business,"" Banuli says. ""Rent for our land costs about $300 and then you need to pay people to clear the land. ""You have to hire a tractor for ploughing and tilling the land. When you add up all these expenses, it's a big investment."" Searching for Sugarman . In Uganda, sugar is big business. This particular batch is headed for Kakira Sugar Limited -- one of the country's oldest and largest factories. Kakira was founded by Muljibai Madhvani, an immigrant from the Indian subcontinent in the late 1920s. It's a company still going strong to this day. ""What you see in the background is the first mill that was installed in 1930 to crush only 150 tons of cane,"" explains Kenneth Barungi, assistant general manager of Kakira at the site of the company's nearby factory. ""(Kakira) started expanding every 10 years, every 20 years, modernizing, acquiring more land, introducing irrigation, expanding the crushing capacity. By (the 1970s) they were producing about 83,000 tons of sugar."" ""That was about 50% of all the sugar produced in Uganda. At that time they (Kakira) contributed to about 53% of the national GDP... just because of manufacturing and industry,"" he added. Dawn of dictatorship . It was at this time, however, that history intervened in the shape of one of the 20th century's most brutal rulers. After a military coup in 1971, army commander Idi Amin Dada seized power. The former heavyweight boxer made himself Uganda's president and a brutal dictatorship followed. The often erratic Amin praised Hitler and said the German dictator ""was right to burn six million Jews."" He even bizarrely offered to be king of Scotland if asked. Within a year he had expelled the country's Asian population, numbering around 35,000. After almost 50 years, the Madhvanis were no longer welcome in Uganda. Those who stayed, did so at their own risk. ""When Idi Amin told every Asian to leave, they all left the country and went mainly to the UK,"" Barungi continued, adding that he believes this when Uganda began to economically fall apart. ""All industries collapsed, all international trade collapsed. There was no longer available foreign exchange to import machinery. Even if you imported the machinery you didn't have technical expertise here to run such industries."" ""Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda. Social services, everything had collapsed."" A new start . After Idi Amin was deposed in 1979, however, some of the ejected population slowly started coming back to Uganda. Among the returnees were the Madhvanis. The country they left behind, however, was a very different place. ""The factory was a skeleton,"" Barungi said. ""There was no longer a sugar plantation, the houses were occupied by anybody. There was no business to run so it (the plantation) was just an empty shell."" The Madhvanis quickly borrowed money from the World Bank and the African Development Bank and set about rebuilding their business. It has grown rapidly over the last 25 years and now produces 18,000 tons of sugar (a year), Barungi said. But the effects of the macabre, harrowing events of recent history still linger. A sweeter deal? Some reports suggest some black Ugandan workers resented how certain sections of the Indian mercantile class treated them. These days, however, Kakira says it strives to promote a responsible philosophy for how it interacts with its workers. Not only is this the right way to engage with people in its employ, they believe, it also improves productivity and staff mobility. Kakira has built schools and hospitals to cater for their staff and their families while the company has also founded the Kakira Outgrowers Rural Development Fund (KORD), an NGO that provides the likes of workshops, loans and other services for its contractors. Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli. They farm the lands neighboring the plantations and are contracted to Kakira, supplying 70% of its sugarcane needs. ""To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources,"" Barungi said. This enlightened approach saw KORD awarded with a best NGO-business partnership award from the Ugandan Manufacturers Association. But it's the positive impact on individual lives that offers the biggest reward for many in the community. ""Before KORD I was just useless,"" said Beatrice Katende, who has received assistance from the body's programs. ""I used to work as a casual laborer for other people in the community digging in their gardens to get some income. ""When KORD came into existence we learned to farm, to save and how to be self-sufficient."" Through offering a hand up to people like Katende, Kakira hope to help themselves as well as provide assistance to other areas of the local economy. ""The main vision was to always make sure that there is labor supply always available to work at the factory. The excess can go and work in other industries in the country,"" Barungi said.

"""The status quo is no longer acceptable."" That's the message the University of Virginia is trying to send its students and others after a scathing Rolling Stone story detailed allegations of a gang rape at a fraternity party, and the school's supposed indifference toward students who are victims of sexual assault. The horrific attack reportedly happened to a woman known only as Jackie, at the start of her freshman year in 2012. She told the magazine she was raped by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi, while two more gave encouragement. The school stands accused of bungling its response to the assault, and sweeping other assault allegations under the rug. ""To Jackie and her parents, I say I am sorry,"" Rector George Keith Martin said at an emergency meeting of UVA's governing board this week. ""To the survivors of sexual assault and their families, I am also sorry."" He added: ""This type of conduct will not be tolerated at the University of Virginia. The status quo is no longer acceptable."" The board unanimously adopted a resolution affirming a zero-tolerance approach toward rape and sexual assault cases. What exactly that means remains to be seen. The actual specifics of the new policy will be worked out later, university officials said. They are scrambling. UVA suspended all fraternities until after the winter break in the wake of the report, and President Teresa Sullivan has called on the Charlottesville Police Department to investigate Jackie's allegations and pleaded for witnesses to come forward with information. A few weeks before the November 19 article hit the newsstands, student-run WUVA interviewed the associate dean of students, Nicole Eramo, who guides women through their options when they report they've been assaulted. In the interview, Eramo admitted that no student had been expelled for committing sexual assault, even when there was an admission, and even though offenses such as academic cheating regularly lead to expulsion. Opinion: Stop shaming victims in college rapes . ""I feel if a person is willing to come forward in that setting and admit they violated the policy when there is absolutely no advantage to do so, then I feel that deserves some consideration, that they are willing to say, 'I have done something wrong and I am willing to take my licks and deal with it,'"" Eramo told reporter Catherine Valentine, explaining why no one had been expelled. Eramo said there had been 38 reports of sexual assault last year. ""I do feel like that person admitting in that context it shows a recognition of what they have done is wrong, and a willingness to improve,"" Eramo said, when pressed on the subject. ""I think we are trying to balance the rights of the individual who is being accused as well as the rights of the complainant and sometimes that is very difficult,"" she said. ""I think you would be surprised to see the number of survivors who I've worked with who don't even want to file a complaint, because they don't want to get the accused person in trouble."" Opinion: A student responds . Although Eramo's interview struck many as tone deaf, particularly given the Rolling Stone story, Jackie released an open letter in support of the associated dean to the student newspaper, The Cavalier Daily. Jackie and other victims of assault at the school said Eramo helped them tremendously as they dealt with what happened to them. ""How can we not do the same for her in her darkest moment?"" asked the letter from her supporters. ""Dean Eramo has truly saved my life. If it were not for her, I do not know if I could be alive today,"" Jackie wrote. Opinion: Punish rapists, not fraternities . Another victim who spoke to CNN, Lyra Bartell, said that Eramo has ""the hardest job at UVA"" and said the problems highlighted by Rolling Stone are more about the policy than about a person. Those policies were at the heart of the discussion at the special board meeting, where officials pledged to change cultural conditions and to improve support for survivors. The university also announced that the state attorney general has asked the law firm O'Melveny & Myers to do an investigation of how the school responds to reports of sexual violence, especially in cases where alleged victims choose not to make a formal complaint. ""I want to make it perfectly clear to you, and to the watching world that nothing is more important to me than the safety of our students,"" President Sullivan said at the meeting. ""Not our reputation, not our success, and not our history or tradition.""

"Wearing a sheer leopard top, Rauda Alaita buzzed around her beauty salon in Damascus. She decided six months ago to open this little shop, paint its walls seafoam green and call it Aloe Vera. ""Everybody told me you are crazy! Starting a business now?"" she said. ""But I thought I should try, and it worked quite well!"" Alaita's hair fell in gelled tendrils around her cheerful face. Her eyes were done up glamorously in a cat-eye. Isn't it strange, running a salon in the middle of a war? ""I think life goes on,"" she replied. ""People are tired. ""In the beginning, everyone was so sad, but little by little, everyone got used to it. It's crazy."" For more than a year and a half, the story of Syria has been told in bodies and bombs. An estimated 28,000 people have died since March 2011 when demonstrators, inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, began rallying for a freer country. They wanted President Bashar al-Assad, who had essentially inherited power from his long-ruling family, gone. Al-Assad cracked down on protesters, claiming ""terrorists"" were attacking the country and blocked most foreign media (or at least made reporting in Syria a life-risking enterprise). The media have depended largely on accounts from rebels fighting al-Assad or al-Assad's own state-run media, the occasional on-the-ground human rights worker or Internet videos Syrians have posted, which are very difficult to vet. Nearly all of it has been about death and misery. None of it has looked like Aloe Vera or the surprisingly vibrant scene CNN experienced during a recent and rare visit to Damascus. The scene in many parts of this city, home to more than 2 million, was far less bloody than expected. People were shopping, walking along crowded streets and going to their jobs. Women were getting their nails done. Syria says Damascus suburbs 'cleansed'; 57 reported dead nationwide . ""We are trying to have a normal life, to live like we usually do,"" said Rama Handi as an Aloe Vero manicurist lacquered her nails red. ""But inside us, it's not the same,"" she said. ""It will never be the same."" She and Alaita say the same thing. They feel stuck in the middle. ""I'm not part of any side,"" the salon owner said. ""It makes it very difficult because nowadays you cannot be in the middle."" Before, people would just talk to each other. Now, you can't have a simple conversation without someone asking first, ""Are you with the government or against the government?"" ""'Are you with or against us?'"" Alaita mimicked. ""It has become really funny."" Handi wore jeans and crossed her petite legs. A fashionable chunky necklace complemented her casual green button-up. Her full, blond hair framed her face. She looked sad but smiled as she politely answered a reporter's questions. How has life changed? ""When we see the people, the people who are living in the streets ... the homes that are gone ... everything makes us unhappy,"" she said. ""Even the jobs, (they are) not like in the past."" She keeps trying to explain. For instance, she offers, she still goes to restaurants. But now she's mindful to leave well before dusk arrives. You have to go home early, she said, because nobody wants to be outside, just in case. Shells are falling, but where, no one can predict. Handi moved her children to a school close to home, fearing for their safety on the 30-minute drive to a better school on the edge of Damascus. ""How do you explain it? My little boy, he doesn't understand really what's happening,"" she said. ""But my daughter ... she understands what's happening. ""We can lie to them. We have to say what is happening, but we (don't) say the people die."" She tells them: There is a bad situation in the country. The first time Alaita heard shelling, she was with one of her young sons. They were both scared. ""Little by little, we start making joke that it's a water pipe sound,"" she said. She felt kind of guilty about kidding around. ""I know it's really bad because people are dying ... for nothing!"" she said. ""People are stupid. For nothing this goes on!"" Handi likes to think things will get better. ""We hope ... everything will be good,"" she says, her voice straining. Not far from the salon, in a middle-class neighborhood near the center of the city, another woman, a pharmacist, is doing brisk business. Her shelves are well-stocked. She's afraid of reprisals from the rebels and asked not to be named. She looks like she's in her 50s. Her make-up is soft and her hair is pulled back the way that women who are very busy style it. She wears a white lab coat. Her female assistant wears the same, a white hijab covers her hair entirely. Business is down maybe 30%, the pharmacist said, but that's mostly because customers aren't buying as many cosmetics and creams anymore. ""We sell too much medicine for anti-stress, depression, sleeping pills,"" she said. ""Yes, we sell too much now."" She's asked how she feels about al-Assad. She says she supports the president. Fighting in Syria is a ""game"" involving ""big countries"" such as Russia and the United States, she believes. There are ""many hands outside"" Syria that are responsible for the violence. She doesn't think al-Assad is to blame. ""I like him. He's a young man,"" she said, echoing a sentiment some Syrians have expressed about 47-year-old al-Assad. They see -- or, at least, saw -- his youth as a sign of modernity and progressivism. Since taking power in 2000, al-Assad has been praised for opening Syria's market to the oil sector. He did open the country to foreign investment and introduced private banking. But in tandem with these advances, Syria's record on human rights was consistently abysmal. People were imprisoned for political reasons. The government blocked access intermittently to the Internet between 2008 and 2011.

"Violent protests left at least five dead and others wounded Wednesday as demonstrations over Quran burning intensified in Afghanistan. Police killed four people and wounded 10 others during protests in Parwan province, said Abdul Wassi Sayedkhili, a provincial council official. Health officials said a fifth person died and 10 others wounded in eastern Nangarhar province. President Hamid Karzai was ""saddened about the civilian casualties during today's demonstrations,"" his office said. Karzai noted an investigation will begin Thursday over the killings. The Qurans were among religious materials removed from a detainee facility at Bagram Airfield. The materials were gathered for disposal and were inadvertently given to troops for burning, Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said Tuesday. ""This was not a decision that was made because they were religious materials,"" he said. ""It was not a decision that was made with respect to the faith of Islam. It was a mistake. It was an error. The moment we found out about it, we immediately stopped and we intervened."" A military official said the materials were removed from the detainee center's library because they had ""extremist inscriptions"" on them and there was ""an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications."" The U.S. Embassy in Kabul went into lockdown as the protests entered a second day Wednesday. Protesters burned tires and threw rocks outside Camp Phoenix, close to the Kabul International Airport, the U.S. Embassy said in its official Twitter feed. It asked Americans to avoid the area, saying the protests had ""turned violent."" It also suspended all travel. On Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside a detention facility in Parwan, according to Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson, a coalition spokesman. Jacobson said protesters tried to penetrate the facility, prompting NATO helicopter to launch flares and authorities to fire rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. A day later in Kabul, about 400 to 500 people rallied, including university students who marched toward the Parliament building, police said. In Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, hundreds chanted ""Down with America"" as crowds gathered near the local airport. A U.S. warden message said more protests are possible in ""coming days,"" adding that ""past demonstrations in Afghanistan have escalated into violent attacks on Western targets of opportunity."" Allen, the coalition commander, offered his apologies Tuesday and issued a directive that all coalition forces in Afghanistan will undergo training no later than March 3 so they can identify religious materials and handle them correctly. Authorities questioned some troops as part of their investigation, but had not detained anyone, a coalition official said. ""This is not who we are. These are very, very isolated incidents,"" Allen said. But Allen's words were not enough to appease angry Afghans who massed outside the Bagram base Tuesday, chanting ""Death to America! Death to the Afghan government! Long live Islam!"" U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter apologized to the Afghan president during a meeting at his presidential palace, according to Karzai's office. Carter also met with Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and several Afghan parliamentarians, offered his apologies to them and ""pledged his full support for a joint Afghan-ISAF investigation into the incident,"" Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby said in a statement. Photographs surfaced purporting to show the damaged Qurans. A photographer for Agence France-Presse said Afghans who work inside the airfield told him they obtained the Qurans there. Authorities said local workers first alerted authorities of the incident. ""The workers immediately interfered, pulled material out -- pulled material out that was partly charred and we have seen Korans that were partly charred,"" Jacobson said. He said the burnings were ""completely unintentional."" Muslims regard the Quran as the absolute word of God. It is so highly revered that many Muslims will not pick up the holy book without ablution, a ritual washing of the hands. Desecrating the book, such as burning it, is therefore seen as an unforgivable affront -- as an act of intolerance and bigotry. Last year, when controversial Florida pastor Terry Jones presided over what he called a trial of the Quran and burned a copy, Afghans took to the streets by the thousands. In the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, demonstrators stormed a U.N. office and killed 12 people. In Kandahar, three people were killed in one demonstration, and nine in another when police and stone-throwing demonstrators clashed. American officials vociferously condemned the pastor's act. In 2010, Afghans protested outside the Forward Operating Base Mirwais in response to an alleged Quran burning inside the base. But coalition forces said the suspected burning was a routine burn-pit session in which military documents are destroyed. On Tuesday, a leading Islamic scholar urged Muslims not to react violently to desecration. ""What is captured on the pages can be printed again. If they burn 1,000, we can print 10,000. What's the big deal?"" said Sheikh Ibrahim Mogra, who chairs the mosques and community affairs committee of the Muslim Council of Britain. ""A NATO soldier killing innocent people is far more painful than the burning of a Quran. I would rather they burn 100 Qurans than to hurt one woman or man or child.""","President Hamid Karzai said he's saddened by the killings and will launch an investigation .

"Jocotenango, Guatemala (CNN) -- Growing up in Guatemala, Juan Pablo Romero Fuentes watched many of his peers succumb to drugs, gangs and crime. ""Kids here are forced to grow up in a very harsh environment filled with violence,"" he said. Reeling from decades of civil war, Guatemala continues to be plagued by poverty and violence. According to the United Nations, the country has the fifth-worst homicide rate. Romero Fuentes became a teacher in his hometown, and he found that many of his students were struggling with the same issues his generation had faced. ""Their parents had no jobs; their families were disintegrating. They had no hope or motivation,"" he said. So, at 23 and with his parent's blessing, Romero Fuentes turned part of his family's home into a community center. In 2006, he began tutoring and mentoring a handful of kids after school. Word spread quickly, and children from all over the community joined the group. Today, his program offers free classes, tutoring and meals, as well as low-cost medical care. His nonprofit, Los Patojos -- which translates to the Little Ones -- has helped more than 1,000 children. ""I created a safe place for them to realize that they actually can change bad aspects in their lives and their community,"" said Romero Fuentes, now 30. ""I wanted to give them a better present in order to attain a brighter future."" Finding hope at home . Los Patojos has become a haven in a region where young people are in desperate need of opportunity and protection. An unprecedented number of children from Central America have made the treacherous journey to the United States to flee violence and poverty in their countries. Since October, more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have been caught crossing the U.S. border. Some 37% are from Guatemala -- more than any other country, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. ""These families are in desperate situations. They have no money and no hope for a better future for their children,"" Romero Fuentes said. Despite this harsh reality, Romero Fuentes believes his country can rebuild itself from within. But for the young people to help do that, he says, they need resources and support. ""In a violent country, the only weapon we can have is love,"" he said. ""These kids are already powerful, but they don't know that yet."" To that end, Los Patojos offers productive activities for people 3 to 18, all aimed at giving them the tools they need to transform their families and their communities. A generation of peacemakers . Romero Fuentes' program takes place in the entire front portion of his family's home as well as another building down the block. At the main center, painted with colorful murals and quotes, children are exposed to a number of creative outlets. They take classes in dance, music, photography, theater and juggling and often put on performances for each other. ""These classes are to show kids that they can pursue their own passions in order to improve their lives,"" Romero Fuentes said. Leadership seminars teach the children about social, political and cultural issues. They learn the importance of moral courage, social justice and self-expression. They also explore ways to reduce violence. ""We are raising them to be the future leaders of Guatemala,"" Romero Fuentes said. The group's feeding program provides a nutritious meal to more than 100 children each day. For many of them, it is the only meal they will have all day, says Romero Fuentes. Los Patojos also runs a medical clinic that provides basic health services to more than 1,500 people each year. And the organization is in the process of building its own school, where more than 250 students will attend preschool through sixth grade. For Romero Fuentes, this is just the beginning. ""I love my city and my country. I want to inspire these kids,"" he said. ""They are the ones in charge of writing the new history in Guatemala."" Want to get involved?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama extended a political olive branch to the GOP on Tuesday, nominating Sen. Judd Gregg, R-New Hampshire, to head the Commerce Department. GOP Sen. Judd Gregg accepted President Obama's nomination as commerce secretary Tuesday. ""Clearly, Judd and I don't agree on every issue, most notably who should've won the [presidential] election,"" Obama joked in announcing the nomination, ""but we do agree on the urgent need to get American businesses and families back on their feet."" Gregg will be an ""able, persuasive ambassador for industry"" because he is a skillful negotiator and a ""master of reaching across the aisle to get things done,"" Obama said. ""We are ... in the middle of a very difficult economic time,"" replied Gregg, who has chaired a key Senate commerce subcommittee. Gregg, a third-term Republican known for being fiscally conservative, thanked Obama for taking the ""rather extraordinary step of asking me to join your administration."" He lauded Obama's ""bold and aggressive, effective and comprehensive plan for how we can get this country moving.""  Watch why Gregg joined Obama's team » . ""This is not a time for partisanship. This is not a time when we should stand in our ideological corners and shout at each other,"" he said. ""This a time to govern, and govern well."" Gregg's decision to accept Obama's offer represents a stunning turnabout -- he voted to abolish the Commerce Department in 1995. If confirmed, he will be the third Republican to join Obama's Cabinet, following Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch will appoint Bonnie Newman, Gregg's former chief of staff, to replace him, the governor said Tuesday. One potential stumbling block to Gregg's nomination had been the issue of the veteran lawmaker's replacement in the Senate. Gregg, whose Senate term is up in 2010, threatened this week to turn down the nomination if it upset the balance in the U.S. Senate. But in a move that will leave the Senate's party breakdown unchanged, New Hampshire's Democratic governor named a Republican to replace Gregg.  Watch why Gregg got the nod » . Democrats hold 58 seats in the Senate, with a Minnesota seat subject to legal challenge. Democrat Al Franken holds a 225-vote lead in that race, but Republican Norm Coleman is challenging the the election recount. If Lynch had named a Democrat to replace Gregg, the Democrats could have had a 60-seat majority, which is needed to overcome Republican attempts to use filibusters to block legislation. ""It is important that President Obama be able to select the advisers he feels are necessary to help him address the challenges facing our nation,"" Lynch said in a statement Monday. Newman, most recently the interim president of the University of New Hampshire, also worked in the White House during the first Bush administration and was an assistant commerce secretary during the Reagan administration. Obama had nominated New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to be commerce secretary, but Richardson withdrew in early January. He cited the distraction of a federal investigation into ties to a company that has done business with his state. CNN's Ed Henry and John King contributed to this report.","NEW: Bonnie Newman, Gregg's former chief of staff, to be picked to replace him .

"MISHAWAKA, Indiana (CNN) -- ""What should I do with my used textbooks?"" Xavier Helgesen of Better World Books and his partners say  they have a small business plan others can follow. That's a question many college students have pondered. But for Xavier Helgesen and his partners, Kreece Fuchs and Jeff Kurtzman, that question laid the foundation for their company, Better World Books. ""We just thought, like, wow, there are all these books out there that the bookstores are just saying, 'No, I don't want it,' but there's totally value in those books,"" Helgesen said. ""You just gotta get them efficiently up on the Internet and then someone will buy them."" Since the university bookstore wouldn't buy back their used textbooks, the founders tried selling the books on the eBay company half.com. The books sold like ""gangbusters,"" Helgesen said, for about $50 each. From there the partners began holding book drives. In one drive in 2002, they collected 2,000 books and then sold them for $20,000 the next autumn. That success led to other drives, but textbooks couldn't sustain the business alone. So Better World Books began reaching out to libraries. ""We went to the American Library Association conference with kind of a one page printed pamphlet that said, 'We'll sell your books,' and we heard all these horror stories,"" Helgesen said. ""We heard of libraries having to dump books down a well at midnight because they weren't allowed to even recycle them, but they didn't have any room on their shelves and they needed a home for these old books. ""Once we started doing that ... we get twice as many books from libraries now than we do from college campuses.""  Watch Helgesen talk about how the company got started » . Every day, Better World brings in 40,000 to 50,000 books, and the company says they send just as many out. Now with more than 2 million books in their Mishawaka, Indiana, warehouse at any given time, the owners of Better World Books said they think they have a book for everyone -- and a small business plan others can follow. Maintaining a successful small business, one that continues to grow in a recession, is no easy feat. After funding the business themselves for the first five years, the founders got a Small Business Administration-backed credit line in 2004, followed by a $2.4 million venture capital investment in 2008. They used the funding to build up their Web site and the Better World Books brand. As other small businesses have struggled, Helgesen and his partners have seen their revenues grow, from $4 million a year in 2005 to a projected $31 million in 2009. And all the time they are helping others buy books they might not ordinarily be able to afford. The cheapest books sell for about $3.50 each, and all of the books are shipped at no cost to customers -- whether they buy 5 or 500 books at a time. The average order is for three or four books. But textbook deals remain at the heart of the Better World Books business. ""We've gone through great lengths to build a business where we bring in tons and tons of college textbooks,"" Helgesen said. ""What's cool about us is we post them at about market level, so some of the books will only be about 20 or 30 percent off, so they may still be $80 to $90. Some other ones are 90 percent off, so you may be getting a $100 book for $10, and that happens every day here."" For Helgesen, Fuchs and Kurtzman, giving back is a vital part of the operation. Better World Books donates 5 to 10 percent of its revenue back into the hands of libraries and literacy programs around the world. And what about the books that still don't sell even at Better World Books? If a book doesn't sell and isn't fit for donation, the company will ship it off for recycling. ""We actually audit our recycler,"" Helgesen said. ""We go there and see what they do, we check who they sell to and try to make sure they're being ethical and not just lighting a big bonfire with the books."" CNN Producer Ben Tinker contributed to this report.","Three partners build business on used college textbooks, library volumes .

"(CNN)Haiti is a tough place, something that's especially so for its millions of poor, of course, but also for the country's middle and upper classes, and foreign visitors. But no matter their status, everyone in the greater Port-au-Prince area on January 12, 2010, was witness to unspeakable horror, when at least 200,000 died in a massive earthquake. Tragically, much of the carnage resulted not from what was a large but still not catastrophic geologic event, but from widespread poverty and poor construction standards that turned entire blocks of buildings into death traps. And this week, as the country has been marking the anniversary of one of the most deadly disasters in human history, the grinding misery of the hemisphere's poorest country is once again being reflected upon. There's still plenty to think about. For a start, Haiti still has the highest infant mortality and unemployment rates in the hemisphere, as well as the lowest life expectancy and daily income. Compounding this problem is the persistent ""brain drain,"" which is seeing large numbers of the nation's young and brightest -- a would-be middle class -- leave the country.  Meanwhile, there is political gridlock, which is hampering the ongoing recovery, with the continuing stalemate prompting the December resignation of another prime minister. Still, despite the challenges, there are some signs of hope. For a start, the economy has been growing, helped by the current government's focus on the tourism and education sectors. And despite continuing problems with widespread hunger as earthquake-related nongovernmental organizations continue to exit, agricultural reforms are making a difference. But perhaps one of the best reasons for optimism comes from the Haitian people themselves. Back in 1991, novelist Herbert Gold published a book about Haiti with the apt title Best Nightmare on Earth.  Yet while the people of this troubled country will readily acknowledge the nightmare, they also manage to find much joy in their lives, and visitors often comment on the preponderance of broad smiles that seem so contradictory to the local circumstances. Indeed, although poor, the nation has a beautiful landscape and long coastline, and is remarkably rich in traditions, culture, history and a mix of languages and connections to Africa, France, the United States and elsewhere. History has shown repeatedly that people and nations can rise from disaster and experience unprecedented success. The Marshall Plan and the economic recovery of Europe after World War II come to mind, as does postwar Japan. More recently, there has been the dramatic physical recovery of so many of the areas pounded by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. So, how can we help the people of Haiti? Of course, the support of the international community is essential, something that has been in evidence to an impressive degree in Haiti, even acknowledging that numerous commitments were not fulfilled.  But as the Ebola crisis in Africa has shown, throwing resources into a hotspot is far from sufficient -- those wishing to help must consider the resources and capacities of the country in need to assist with the planning, execution and monitoring of help. Affected peoples are always going to be a critical piece of determining what will work, so health and development interventions and investments must consider and defer to them from the start. After all, even the best ideas and innovations, especially those prepared at a desk thousands of miles away, won't be effective without strong local guidance. Unfortunately, one of the critiques of Haiti's recovery has been that well-meaning foreigners flooded in and imposed their ideas, too often ignoring locals' wishes and ideas. Still, two projects in post-earthquake Haiti demonstrate how local input can be instrumental in producing results. For example, under the leadership of the Haitian government, a range of partners have assisted with the annual distribution of effective, mostly donated drugs to help prevent the spread of four parasites that can cause disfiguring, disabling and even deadly tropical diseases.  A critical aspect of the success of these efforts has been the World Health Organization's use of local community leaders to organize, promote and distribute the drugs in their communities.  Indeed, with some training, promotional materials and a deep knowledge of their communities, the leaders' success at engaging the participation of fellow villagers far surpassed expectations. As a result, during one nationwide campaign since the earthquake, drugs were delivered to an unprecedented 86% of Haiti's 10 million people -- no other recorded intervention in Haiti appears to have encompassed so many residents. Another project of note has been one working to fortify Haitian salt with iodine for the first time, a life-changing public health intervention long used throughout much of the rest of the world. Local marketing teams have managed to instill awareness among more than 80% of salt purchasers of the iodized product. This measure is undertaken particularly with fetuses, infants and prepubescent teenagers in mind, and helps in the development of brain tissue -- a health benefit that will have a long lasting, positive impact on the country's physical, educational and therefore economic health. Five years after disaster struck, much remains to be done. But by working with the local community, a growing global economy and the steadfast spirit of the Haitian people offer hope that this island will one day offer a recovery success story that will be remembered in the history books.","Thomas Streit: Locals key to Haiti earthquake recovery .

"On canvas, Vladimir Putin appears stern, Tony Blair looks relaxed and Junichiro Koizumi smiles broadly. Through paint and brushstroke, former President George W. Bush says he has found not only a rewarding hobby but a unique way to express himself and his impressions of 30 presidents, prime ministers and other world leaders during his time in office. These never-before-seen portraits, which were done by looking at photographs, will go on public display Saturday at his presidential library in Dallas. The exhibit is titled ""The Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy."" It will also include photographs and artifacts of his interactions with these leaders. ""I think they're going to be (like), 'Wow, George Bush is a painter,""' Bush told NBC's ""Today"" show in an interview on Friday. ""I'm sure when they heard I was painting, (they said), 'Wow, I look forward to seeing a stick figure he painted of me.'"" One work he is most proud of is that of his father, former President George H.W. Bush. ""I painted a gentle soul,"" he said. The Bush Presidential Center is using these paintings to help broaden the image of Bush and is hoping to show ""what it takes to be a personal diplomat,"" said Margaret Spellings, president of the center, emphasizing one-on-one relationships with his fellow heads of state were very important to him. Most of the world leaders portrayed have not seen the art yet. George W. Bush to unveil paintings . The rebirth of cool . For newer generations the artwork, and the buzz around them, will show a new side of Bush. The 43rd President has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity, a bump aided partly by his work trying to save the lives of Africans who have AIDS and efforts to help veterans, including helping them to find jobs. Forty-nine percent viewed him favorably while 46% saw him unfavorably according to a poll last June from Gallup. When Bush left office in 2009, only 40% of Americans held a favorable opinion of him, a number which sunk to 35% in March of that year before beginning a slow climb out from under water. He's also earned nods from such publications as BuzzFeed and Vanity Fair that noted his counterculture hipness in painting outside of the art establishment  and taking selfies. Though the former President has opened a new chapter of his life with painting, there were reminders of the controversies surrounding his presidency. Just this week, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to seek declassification of its report on the secret prisons and interrogation techniques used by his administration on terror suspects after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Bush also has refused to publicly discuss politics. In a video accompanying the exhibit, he said of the Dalai Lama: ""I painted him as sweetly as I could."" For Blair, the former British Prime Minister and one of the leaders he spent the most time with, Bush said he painted ""with a lot of affection"" and was trying to convey ""a passionate person and a reliable person."" After reading an essay about Winston Churchill's art hobby, Bush took up painting two years ago. ""I gave it a whirl,"" he said in the video. He hopes the paintings help convey his feelings and friendships to these leaders. He told NBC this will help ""make sure the last chapters of my life are full."" Opinion: Bush paints, but is he any good? ""I want to get better"" Bush said he still has a lot to learn with this hobby. ""I am not a great artist,"" he told his daughter Jenna Bush Hager, who is a ""Today"" show correspondent, in the NBC interview.  ""I paint a lot. I want to get better."" He has his share of critics. New York Magazine Art critic Jerry Salz said of some of Bush's previous  artwork ""no natural giftsâ€”except the desire to do this."" Bush's family said he is very disciplined and dedicated to his work and will often spend hours in his new studio with music playing. Family and friends said he is very excited about his work. ""He talks enthusiastically about it,"" Spellings said. Bush ""utterly loves it."" Bush uses various photos to see facial expressions, clothing and other attributes that he then uses to craft his paintings. He started off doing some smaller things like animals. Then an art professor at a local university suggested he try doing world leaders because he was good at capturing details. He was initially reluctant to share his work publicly. However, his paintings first came to light after a hacker last year obtained private Bush family emails, which included photos of some of his work. Some of the other paintings featured dogs. But other paintings were self-portraits of him in the shower and the bathtub while he was looking in a mirror. ""It's an invasion of one's privacy. And yeah, I was annoyed,"" Bush told NBC. ""And nor do I want my paintings to get out. And I found it very interesting the first painting that came out was the one I painted of myself in the bathtub. I did so because I wanted to kind of shock my instructor."" Bush on painting: 'I see colors differently'","George W. Bush's paintings will go on public display Saturday at his presidential library .

"The newly-appointed U.S. chair of the international diamond watchdog has called for a review of what constitutes a ""blood diamond."" According to the Kimberley Process, launched in 2003 to certify that diamonds do not come from conflict zones, blood diamonds are rough diamonds used by rebel movements or their allies to finance armed conflicts aimed at undermining legitimate governments. Now, Gillian Milovanovic, who was named chair of the Kimberley Process in late January, wants the definition to be broadened. ""One of the things which will certainly be looked at and which we certainly support looking at and believe should get a close look is whether that definition is still sufficiently encompassing or appropriate given today's challenges,"" she said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Robyn Curnow. Milovanovic's chairmanship comes at a challenging time for the scheme, following the fallout from its decision last year to allow Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe to sell diamonds from its controversial Marange fields. The move was criticized by activists and led to Global Witness, one of the initiative's founding members, to pull out of the process in December, saying the  diamond regulatory group had refused ""to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds, violence and tyranny."" An edited version of Milovanovic's interview follows. CNN: Is the Kimberley Process in crisis? Gillian Milovanovic: No, I do not believe so. In fact, I'm very pleased to have an opportunity to be the chair at this time because we are essentially on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Process. Read more: What are 'conflict diamonds?' CNN: Global Witness, one of the founding members, has pulled out -- they said it was because they were shocked that the Kimberley Process had authorized sales of diamonds from Marange fields in Zimbabwe. What's your reaction to that? GM: Obviously we're very sorry that that was the decision that Global Witness took, they were one of the founding members of the process -- unfortunate, sad development but the bridges are not cut as far as we are concerned and certainly I intend to talk with everyone. CNN: Their decision came after the authorization of diamond sales from Zimbabwe, very controversial fields in Marange. GM: Well certainly for two years the Kimberley Process labored to find a solution to how to handle the diamonds from Marange -- November of last year the process made a decision, the United States deliberately chose to abstain in order to allow the process to continue and in order to move forward. Now that said, I think that for our chairmanship the experience of the difficulties that we're experiencing in finding a solution for the Marange diamonds are an impetus to looking at how well the Kimberley Process is situated to deal with today's challenges. Read also: Campaign group pulls out of 'blood diamond' scheme . CNN: From the U.S. perspective, you said you've abstained from that decision, why has the U.S. particularly imposed sanctions against one of the companies operating in Marange? GM: The United States, on a bilateral basis of course, has sanctions against Zimbabwean identified entities. Essentially these are imposed because these entities are undermining democracy and democratic institutions. And it happens that some entities which are designated by our process as having to do with undermining democracy are in fact 50 per cent or more shareholders in diamond mines in Marange and hence the link between the two things. CNN: There is a sense of contradiction here -- why didn't you veto it, particularly because the U.S. has sanctions against some companies in the Zimbabwean diamond fields. GM: But there is also, one could argue, a similar situation in the fact that the Kimberley Process indeed made a decision by consensus, minus us, that to certify diamonds from a number of mines, whereas those same diamonds cannot be imported into the United States, that is the situation. With respect to my own chairmanship, I have been asked to be the chair and therefore my role as I see it is to give impetus, to show leadership but to understand that it is the organization that is ultimately going to be responsible for the decisions that are made. See video: How to avoid buying 'blood diamonds' CNN: Do you see the definition of a blood diamond being widened? GM: A diamond. the proceeds of which are used by illicit guerrilla or rebel entities trying to overthrow a legitimate government, that was the basis on which the organization was founded. One of the things which will certainly be looked at and which we certainly support looking at and believe should get a close look is whether that definition is still sufficiently encompassing or appropriate given today's challenges. CNN: How can you be sure as a consumer that the diamonds that you have on your finger are not being used to finance a corrupt or conflict scenario? GM: I think that it's important that the consumers do understand that it's not a conflict diamond in the sense of the definition which exists, mainly the guerrillas are not using the money from this to conduct bloody wars to overthrow a legitimate government. Now, if one is looking for something beyond that as a consumer that is the kind of question that one needs to address to the person who is selling the diamond.","Gillian Milovanovic is the first U.S. chair of the U.N.- backed Kimberley Process .

"Washington (CNN) -- Monica Lewinsky took another step into the public spotlight on Monday when she joined Twitter. ""#HereWeGo,"" the former White House intern who had an affair with President Bill Clinton tweeted early on Monday. Her account was quickly verified by the social media site. Joining Twitter is just the latest step in Lewinsky's re-entry into public life. Lewinsky penned an essay in May for Vanity Fair about her life after the affair and her reaction to the news that Hillary Clinton refereed to her as a ""narcissistic loony toon"" in a conversation with a close friend. Lewinsky, who is a contributor for Vanity Fair, wrote another essay for the magazine in July about online bullying. Later on Monday, Lewinsky will give a speech at the Forbes Under 30 Summit, an appearance that is being billed as her first public speech in 13 years. Lewinsky's remarks will focus on her life after the affair and scandal that led to Bill Clinton's impeachment. ""He and the rest of the world moved on — but she could not, a fate now realized, on various scales, by millions of people — from Jennifer Lawrence to random junior high schoolers—who find themselves tarred in public, permanent ways,"" Forbes writes about her speech. ""Lewinsky, who last talked publicly 13 years ago, will offer a singular perspective on what happened to her, and the scourge of harassment in the digital age."" Lewinsky later tweeted that she was ""excited (and nervous)"" to speak at the event. Lewinsky's reentry into public life comes at the same time that Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton's wife and the former secretary of state, is considering a run at the presidency. During her book tour earlier this year, Clinton was repeatedly asked about Lewinsky's Vanity Fair essay. Clinton told People that she did not read the Lewinsky essay. ""I've moved on,"" she said.","Monica Lewinsky joined Twitter on Monday.
Her first tweet, from an account that was quickly verified by the social media site, was simply ""#HereWeGo"".
Lewinsky has published multiple essays this year, including a Vanity Fair piece in June.
The former White House intern will give a speech on the subject later on Monday."
"The U.N. Security Council is riddled with double standards and has failed the Middle East, Saudi Arabia said Friday as it rejected an offer to join the body. The kingdom claims that the council is incapable of keeping the peace internationally, the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency SPA. ""To have the Palestinian cause remaining without a fair and permanent solution for 65 years, which resulted in several wars that threatened international peace and security, is evidence and proof of (the) Security Council's inability to perform his duties and responsibilities,"" the ministry said. It also blamed the Security Council for not preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction in the region -- especially nuclear weapons, a likely allusion to Saudi Arabia's adversarial neighbor Iran. Lastly, the kingdom brought up the civil war in Syria, blaming the U.N. for not punishing the government after a poison gas attack there killed hundreds of civilians. Saudi Arabia supports Syrian rebels and advocates the overthrow of autocratic Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.","The U.N.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Delegations from the United States and several European nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly Thursday during Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech, in which he repeatedly condemned the United States and said some countries use the Holocaust as an ""excuse to pay ransom... to Zionists."" Delegates from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom were among those who walked out. Delegations from Canada and Israel were not present from the beginning. In his remarks, Ahmadinejad called the September 11, 2001, attacks ""mysterious"" and said they were a pretext for a U.S.-led war against Afghanistan and Iraq. He said the United States killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden instead of assigning a fact-finding team to investigate ""hidden elements involved in September 11."" He also placed blame on the United States for numerous global problems including the financial crisis, criticizing it for dominating the world's ""policy-making establishments,"" overspending on the military, and ""printing trillions of dollars"" that triggered inflation, according to an English translation of his speech provided by Iran's U.N. mission. Ahmadinejad said the U.S. government views Zionism as ""sacred,"" and that ""European countries still use the Holocaust after six decades as the excuse to pay (a) fine or ransom to the Zionists."" After assailing the United States, Ahmadinejad said ""the main question is the quest for the root cause of such attitudes. The prime reason should be sought in the beliefs and tendencies of the establishment. An assembly of people in contradiction with the inner human instincts and disposition who also have no faith in God and in the path of the divine prophets, replace their lust for power and materialistic ends with heavenly values. To them, only power and wealth prevail, and every attempt must bring into focus these sinister goals."" On the eve of the address, the Iranian president declared his country to be ""a new model for life to the world."" He also said that the United States might be willing to ""hijack"" the Middle East uprisings, according to the Iranian state-run news agency IRNA, but did not further explain his assertion. Ahmadinejad's appearance at the United Nations in New York comes a day after two U.S. hikers, held in an Iranian prison for more than two years, were released. Wednesday evening, Ahmadinejad met with a group of U.S. university students, and then gave an interview to Iranian satellite television. His office provided translated quotes from both. The Iranian leader said ""that the world is in need of change, and Marxism, liberalism, humanism and the West could not solve man's problems,"" his office said. Ahmadinejad added that ""relying on its culture and rich civilization,"" Iran is ""the only nation"" that ""can offer a new model for life to the world."" He told the students ""that the U.S. may be willing to hijack the regional uprisings but a stormy movement is under way,"" IRNA reported. ""Elsewhere in his speech, he said that the U.N. was set up with the objective of preventing bullying in the world, but this did not happen,"" IRNA reported. About 100 undergraduate and graduate students, along with some professors, attended the invitation-only dinner and question-and-answer session in New York, moderated by an Iranian U.N. official. Ahmadinejad did not eat with the guests. Students who spoke with CNN afterward expressed excitement about the event. At the end, the guests were given hand-painted plates from Iran and books about theology. The mood was jovial and positive, people who were there said. While some questions were asked about nuclear issues, the economy, and Israel, the tone remained positive. Ahmadinejad joked and laughed at times. Participants included students and staff from Princeton, Fordham, Hofstra, Columbia, New York University, and other schools. Strict security measures included the collection of phones and cameras before the event. It was described as a very different experience from Ahmadinejad's controversial 2007 appearance at Columbia University. That year, the school's president, Lee Bollinger, challenged him on human rights, on his statements questioning whether the Holocaust happened, and on his call for Israel to be ""wiped off the map"" as a Jewish state. Bollinger told Ahmadinejad he exhibits ""all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator."" Large protests against Ahmadinejad's regime took place surrounding that event. The group United Against Nuclear Iran -- whose founders include former CIA Director Jim Woolsey and the late Ambassador Richard Holbrooke -- slammed Wednesday's event. The participants ""should be ashamed of themselves,"" said David Ibsen, the group's executive director, describing it as ""a propagandistic attempt by the regime to improve its image. Anyone claiming to support liberty, tolerance, and human rights should strongly oppose a dictator who oppresses women, kills homosexuals, violates his citizens' basic rights and religious freedoms, and pursues nuclear weapons."" Ahmadinejad also gave an interview to New York Times op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof in which he discussed the dispute over Iran's nuclear activities. He said that if the United States gives Iran 20% enriched uranium, ""we will cease the domestic enrichment of uranium of up to 20% this very week. We only want the 20% enrichment for our domestic consumption. If they give it to us according to international law, according to IAEA laws, without preconditions, we will cease domestic enrichment."" The IAEA -- International Atomic Energy Agency -- is the U.N. entity that monitors nuclear activity in the world. Many countries, including the United States, believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons program, but Tehran insists its activities are only to provide energy for the country. When asked about the uprising in Syria, Ahmadinejad told Kristof that the Syrian government, ""just like any other country,"" should engage in dialogue. ""With clashes and confrontations problems will not be solved. They will be multiplied. Differences will be multiplied and magnified. And certainly foreigners must not intervene. Intervention of foreigners will only make the problem that much bigger, and will never solve it."" After the 2009 elections that kept Ahmadinejad in office, Iranian forces launched a violent crackdown on street protests. The 2011 U.S. State Department human rights report on Iran says ""scores of protesters and non-protesting bystanders were killed, especially during anti-government rallies. Government sources reported the death toll at 37, opposition groups reported approximately 70 individuals died, and human rights organizations suggested as many as 388."" Ahmadinejad, in his interview with Kristof, painted a very different picture. ""In total there were 33 lives lost,"" he said. ""More than two-thirds of those killed belonged to the security forces and innocent bystanders. Less than one-third were those who clashed with the security/police forces. So they were a very, very small minority.""","NEW: Ahmadinejad refers to the U.S. government as having ""no faith in God""

"(CNN)The 2015 Golden Globes stood up for free speech -- in more ways than one. The show will remembered for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's (presumed) last hosting hurrah, a running gag featuring Margaret Cho as a North Korean representative and a couple of gasp-inducing Bill Cosby jokes. And as always, there were the usual bunch of what Ricky Gervais called ""rich, beautiful over-privileged people,"" a few of whom, Gervais included, definitely seemed to be enjoying their drinks. But the Golden Globes also provided some stirring moments and hints of the awards season still to come: . 1. Standing up for free speech and social justice . As we've seen with the threats over ""The Interview"" and the Charlie Hebdo tragedy, there are still many who have no respect for diverse opinions -- or diversity, period. In a rousing address, Theo Kingma, head of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- the journalists' organization that puts on the Globes -- called out the need for free speech. ""As international journalists, we understand the freedom of artistic expression. It is not only an integral part of the American fabric but a beacon that is reflected across the globe,"" he said. ""Together we will stand united against anyone that will repress free speech. Anywhere, from North Korea to Paris."" He received a standing ovation. Many stars wore ""Je Suis Charlie"" buttons in honor of the French magazine and its cartoonists who were slain by terrorists last week. The awards themselves showcased a diversity of subjects and performances. ""Transparent,"" a show about a family finding new strength after realizing the father, played by Jeffrey Tambor, is transgender, won best comedy series. Tambor also won for best actor in a comedy series. ""Glory,"" from the movie ""Selma,"" won best original song. In his speech, Common highlighted the many faces of the movie. ""I am the hopeful black woman who was denied the right to vote. I am the caring white supporter,"" he said. ""I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand but instead was given a bullet. I am the two fallen police officers, murdered in the line of duty. 'Selma' has awakened my humanity. We look to the future, and we want to create a better world. Now is our time to change the world. Selma is now."" 2. Women take center stageThough women still have to fight for worthy movie roles -- "" 'Boyhood' proves that there are still roles for women over 40, as long as you're hired while you're still under 40,"" went one of Fey and Poehler's zingers -- the Globes showed that they're finding greater influence behind the scenes. ""Transparent"" was created by Jill Soloway. ""The Affair,"" which won best TV drama series, was co-created by Sarah Treem. ""Selma"" was directed by Ava DuVernay. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, who won best actress in a TV miniseries or movie, was having none of the hand-wringing about women's roles. ""What I think is new is the wealth of roles for actual women in television and in film. That's what I think is revolutionary, and evolutionary, and it's what's turning me on,"" she said. 3. Upsets! On the TV side, ""The Affair"" beat ""Game of Thrones"" and ""House of Cards,"" among others, for best drama series, and the show's Ruth Wilson won best actress in a drama series. Gina Rodriguez of ""Jane the Virgin"" won best actress in a comedy series. ""Fargo"" took home TV movie/miniseries over ""Olive Kitteridge"" and ""True Detective."" But it's the movies that have awards-watchers wondering. ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" won animated film over ""Big Hero 6"" and ""The Lego Movie."" Amy Adams won best actress in a musical or comedy for ""Big Eyes."" And the Globes may indicate a groundswell for Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" It won best musical or comedy film over the favorite, ""Birdman."" Oh, and there was another kind of ""upset."" If you noticed some stars looking sweaty and uncomfortable, it may have been the apparently toasty climate inside the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton (although a hotel spokeswoman says the A/C was ""fully operational""). Frances McDormand summed it up with her aggressive fanning. 4. ""Boyhood"" is the Oscars front-runner . On the drama side, however, there was no drama: ""Boyhood"" won best picture, Richard Linklater won best director, and Patricia Arquette won best supporting actress. The three-hour film, shot piecemeal over the course of 12 years, has long been touted as the Oscar front-runner. It cemented that status Sunday night at the Globes. 5. Charming George Clooney . You can always count on Clooney to add a touch of class and wit to any proceedings, and he didn't disappoint at the Globes, where he was given the Cecil B. DeMille Award. He was self-deprecating, joking about the bad reviews for his own ""Monuments Men,"" and then prompted a million sighs when he paid heartfelt tribute to his new wife, Amal Alamuddin. Moreover, he didn't forget about his colleagues, working in praise for the late Lauren Bacall and Robin Williams, and went out with a comment about the Paris marches for Charlie Hebdo and free speech. ""They marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear,"" he said. Clooney, as he often does, said it all. CNN's Lisa France contributed to this story.","Golden Globes award show highlighted free speech, diversity issues .

"(CNN)When you pass Josue Lajeunesse in the halls of Princeton University's commanding campus, he glances up, smiles and carries on doing what he has done for the past 20 years: cleaning. Keeping the dormitories and lecture halls spotless for Ivy League students has been his livelihood since Lajeunesse moved to the United States as a young man. He works two jobs to support his family: janitor by day, taxi driver by night. But it's what he's done thousands of miles away that will amaze you most. There is a part of all of us that hangs on to where we are from, that wants to help those we leave behind. For Lajeunesse, that desire consumes him. Though he lives in New Jersey, his heart and mind are never far from Haiti, where he was born. In November we traveled to Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with Lajeunesse. We were on a journey to his hometown of La Source, a tiny village in the mountains to the south of the island nation. We wanted to see for ourselves what Lajeunesse had accomplished -- what had become the subject of a documentary named ""La Source."" After seemingly endless hours driving on the worst roads we'd ever seen, we pulled up to the top of a hill and parked next to a huge cement block. That hollow, gigantic block held something priceless for the people of La Souce: clean water. It's priceless because Unicef estimates 768 million people around the world still use unsafe drinking water sources. Every minute, a child somewhere in the world dies of a water-related disease, according to Water.org.  The World Health Organization says about 1.6 million people die of diarrheal diseases every year from a lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. ""When I touch the water, the reservoir, I feel I touch my heart ... my own blood,"" Lajeunesse told us. The story of how the water came to La Source is a tale of triumph over all odds and of one man's decades-long determination. As a young boy growing up in La Source, Lajeunesse and his brother Chrismedonne would make the treacherous three-hour climb up and down the side of a mountain to reach a spring. It was the only way they could get clean water for their family. They watched as their fellow villagers got sick from drinking contaminated water from the river below or injured themselves climbing the mountain trying to do the same. When they were children, Josue  and Chrismedonne vowed to build a pipeline to bring that clean water down to the village, but the money was far too hard to come by. The 2010 Haiti earthquake made the situation even worse. Lajeunesse watched the news about the Haiti earthquake from his home in Princeton, New Jersey, where he had moved in 1989. In the days to come he would learn 11 of his relatives had died in the earthquake.  His daughter was visiting family in Haiti when it hit. She survived. She was one of the lucky ones. For Lajeunesse, the earthquake was a breaking point. But as a single father of four -- working two jobs to get by -- he felt helpless. Then his mind turned to water and the dream he'd had with his brother 40 years ago. Over the following months, Lajeunesse raised $38,000 with students at Princeton to build the pipeline that would bring clean water to La Source. Raising the money was only the beginning. Building the pipeline would prove immensely challenging and take the strength of the entire village to accomplish. Yet eventually, it came to be. ""Do you feel proud?"" we ask Lajeunesse after seeing all he has done for his village. ""I'm proud for the people there but not proud for myself,"" he said. The people of La Source are the ones, he says, that drive him to be better -- to do better. He feels like he hasn't done enough. Exactly five years since that devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck and claimed more than 230,000 lives, the work in Haiti still to be done remains daunting. Roads are in shambles; some neighborhoods in the capital of Port-au-Prince remain flattened; families mourn their loved ones lost. But there is a light that shines from La Source -- the light of one man's power to unite his village and lift them higher. He had a dream and made that dream a reality. Lajeunesse isn't finished. Now that he's brought water to La Source, he is working with a local charity to build a school in the village. Next, he hopes to build a clinic. Eighty percent of Haiti's population lives below the poverty line. Ask Lajeunesse where he gets the drive to work tirelessly for his people -- even living thousands of miles away -- and he replies:  ""Because I know exactly the way they suffer."" It's clear he has no idea how much he has eased their suffering, and in a way, given them a gift greater than water. ""The government cannot do everything,"" Lajeunesse says emphatically as we walk through La Source, dodging the rain under the canopy of trees. ""The Haitian ... population needs to take the responsibility.  Everybody, you know, can help, can put hands together, all of us. Because this is our country."" As he wraps up another janitorial shift on Princeton's campus and clocks out in the bitter cold of a January afternoon, Lajeunesse leaves us with this: . ""If I can work another two jobs again to change the community and the life of the kids for the next generation, I will. I will do it with happiness.""","A 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti on January 12, 2010 .

"Dartmouth College canceled classes Wednesday after a student protest sparked a threatening backlash on a campus online forum, according to a college spokesman. On Friday, current Dartmouth students interrupted a welcome show for recently admitted students by chanting about aspects of student life they found troubling, such as issues around homophobia and sexual assault on campus. The welcome show was designed to highlight why the prospective students should attend Dartmouth, college spokesman Justin Anderson said. The decision to cancel classes was prompted by a series of threatening and abusive online posts that targeted the students who protested at the welcome show, a letter sent to Dartmouth students and faculty said. The online postings appeared on BoredAtBaker.com, a Dartmouth-exclusive forum where students post about happenings on campus, according to student Dani Valdes, 22.  The website has since been shut down. Comments on the website included derogatory, homophobic, racist, and sexist remarks directed at the student protesters.  Threats of violence and sexual assault also appeared.  Although student protesters expected campus-wide reaction, they say were not anticipating the level of hostility they experienced. ""I think that all of us knew what we were getting ourselves into when we decided to protest this, but I don't think any of us expected to receive such extreme threats of death and rape and lynching,"" said Nastassja Schmiedt, 20. College administrators announced that classes would be replaced by ""alternative programming"" for the college community ""to discuss Dartmouth's commitment to fostering debate that promotes respect for individuals, civil and engaged discourse, and the value of diverse opinions."" ""We feel it is necessary for the community as a whole to have the opportunity to learn about all that has transpired and to discuss further action that will help us live up to our mission,"" the letter stated. The alternative programming included a large meeting of faculty, a discussion facilitated by a social justice and diversity consultant, a community gathering, lunch and smaller 'teach-in' discussions led by Dartmouth faculty and staff. However, student protesters are unsatisfied with the administration's reaction to recent events. ""We've made petitions and nothing has changed. Our previous efforts have really fallen on deaf ears.  They haven't reached out to us and they haven't taken a stance on the protest,"" Schmiedt said. Dartmouth President Carol Folt did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment. However, college administrators told students that the decision to hold alternative programming in lieu of classes was not made lightly. ""Together, we will make this day an important step toward realizing a better Dartmouth,"" the letter said. According to Anderson, none of the students who disrupted the event or posted online are being sought by law enforcement. In March, administrators at Oberlin College canceled classes after a student reported seeing a person resembling a Ku Klux Klan member on campus. The incident followed a string of hate-related events that month.","Dartmouth holds discussions, 'teach-ins' after protesting students are threatened online .

"Anger over Greece's austerity measures exploded in the streets of Athens early Monday as tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in riots that left 106 police officers and dozens of civilians injured, according to police. The riot, widely described as one of the worst in Athens since Greece began dealing with its crippling debt crisis in 2010, broke out after the Greek Parliament approved a new package of austerity measures in return for a new eurozone bailout of the debt-stricken country. Protesters among a crowd estimated by police at about 80,000 hurled rocks and firebombs toward police. Officers responded with tear gas. At least 74 people were arrested, police said. Police said investigators were still tallying property damages, but the Athens News Agency said more than 45 buildings were damaged by fire and numerous others were looted. Among the damaged buildings were a bank, cafes and a movie theater, the news agency reported. The violent protests reflect increasing angst in Greece over crushing economic problems, said CNN iReporter Thanasis Trompoukis. ""They are protesting because they feel that there is no end in their financial suffering. More and more (people) every day are getting poorer and become homeless in Greece, and especially Athens,"" he said. Photos: Police scatter Greek protesters with tear gas . The package, which includes deep cuts in government spending, wages and pensions, will help pave the way for eurozone finance ministers to sign off on the new €130 billion ($172.6 billion) bailout deal. It passed Parliament in a 199-74 vote. Greece needs the funds in order to meet €14.5 billion in debt repayments due next month. Speaking before the vote, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos called for calm. ""This vandalism, violence, they have no place in a democracy and will not be tolerated,"" he told lawmakers, urging them to approve the deal. ""At this critical time, we don't have the luxury of such conflicts,"" he said. Echoing comments he made in a speech to the Cabinet Saturday evening, Papademos warned lawmakers the government would not be able to pay salaries, cover services or import basic goods if the plan was not approved. He spoke about the possibility of ""catastrophic bankruptcy."" ""It's a hard program, a tough program, which also envisages some painful sacrifices,"" he said, adding that the plan would put Greece back on ""stable ground."" Protesters criticizing the program have demonstrated for days. Interactive: How do eurozone figures stack up? On Saturday, some isolated scuffles broke out as protesters rallied in Syntagma Square, in front of the Parliament building, but the mood was calmer than a day earlier. Friday's protest dispersed after youths smashed pavements and began throwing stones and pieces of marble, as well as Molotov cocktails, at the police, who responded with stun grenades and teargas. Monday's protests are being widely described as some of the worst since the Greek debt crisis began in 2010. In May of that year, three people died when a fire bomb hit a bank in central Athens during protests over austerity measures. Even though the sweeping reform package agreed to by Greece and the so-called troika -- made up of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- was approved in Parliament, Greek lawmakers must still do more. Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg and head of the Eurogroup, which brings together euro-area finance ministers, said Thursday that other assurances were also needed from Athens before the bailout could be paid out. Greece's political leaders must pledge that they will continue to implement the measures after upcoming elections, he said. Athens must also find a further €325 million in ""structural expenditure"" cuts for 2012, Juncker added. The bailout deal, which would result in significant losses for bondholders, is intended to help reduce Greece's debts to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020, from about 160% currently. Greece, which owes some €330 billion, has come close to default before. The nation has struggled to follow through on austerity measures and economic reforms that were a condition of its 2010 bailout package. At the same time, the Greek economy has been in recession for years and many analysts warn that additional austerity could make the situation worse. U.S. and European stocks were higher Monday morning following passage of the austerity package. Stock markets have been anxious about the potential impact of a Greek default on the European and world economies.","Riots leave 106 police officers, scores of civilians injured .

"The Greek parliament early Thursday narrowly adopted a new round of austerity cuts that are required for Greece to receive the next installment of a crucial international economic bailout. The final tally in the 300-member parliament was 153 votes in favor of the cuts and 128 opposed, with 18 abstentions. The cuts have provoked ire among Greeks furious about the effects of multiple rounds of belt-tightening, which have resulted in cuts to pensions and pay. They have seen unemployment soar to more than 25%. It is Greece's fifth year of recession. Earlier, protesters in Athens threw Molotov cocktails and police fought back with tear gas outside the parliament as lawmakers prepared to vote. As many as 70,000 people took part in the demonstration in Athens' central Syntagma Square, outside the parliament building, according to police estimates. Analysis: Greek misery won't end with bailout votes . Passage of the cuts was needed for the payout of the next international bailout installment of 31.5 billion euros (about $40.2 billion), which the government desperately needs to stay in operation. Without the funds, it said, it would run out of money by mid-November. ""Greece has made a big, decisive, optimistic step, a step towards recovery,"" Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said after the vote. ""Today we made a first important step for which I am obviously happy."" There is a second step needed before Greece can get the bailout funds: Sunday's vote on the 2013 budget. Because it contains many of the measures from Wednesday's vote, it is expected to pass. More than one-fifth of the population could face poverty, defined as a family of four on an income of 13,842 euros (about $17,500) per year, state news agency AMNA has reported. The austerity bill sets out reforms and fiscal measures worth 13.5 billion euros over the next two years. It will raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and cut pensions on average between 5% and 15%. Some salaries in the public sector will be reduced by about a third, and several bonuses will be scrapped. Some judges must take a 30% pay cut, for example. The thorniest issue is that of labor law changes. Analysis: Euro crisis opens old wounds for Greece, Germany . The bill gives the government the right to set the minimum wage as of April 2013. It also reduces the redundancy notice period -- the time given to workers to leave their jobs after being laid off -- and limits compensation for workers with more than 16 years of service, as well as allowing stores the right to ask employees to work more flexible hours. The anger in the Greek population against the latest round of cuts, which come on top of many others, runs deep. ""The measures just never stop. Every time, politicians say they are going to be the last measures ... they are never the last,"" Melina Grigoriadou, a 50-year-old married businesswoman with two children, told CNN. ""There is no end in this, there's no solution. The measures are awful -- it's not austerity, it's something even worse."" Although Grigoriadou works for an export company that has not cut wages, she said her family's income has fallen by almost a third because of new taxes, higher utility bills and inflation. As she looks around in Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, she sees real poverty affecting those who've had their incomes and pensions drastically cut, or suddenly lost their jobs. Despite paying for social security from her wages, getting a doctor's appointment now takes months and medicines are costly, she added. What makes the hardship worse is that the international funds Greece stands to receive will not go to help create jobs or support infrastructure, Grigoriadou said, but to service its huge debt. Some critics of austerity have called for economic stimulus programs instead, like those implemented in the United States. But if Greece is to stick to the course laid out by the so-called troika -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- more budget cuts will be necessary, as the country's debt woes are worse than previously believed. Read more: Journalist who embarrassed Greeks with 'rich list' acquitted . Recent budget projections for the Greek government exceed the worst-case scenarios drawn up by international lenders when they agreed to a bailout, according to a Financial Times report published by CNN. However, the hardship many Greek people are suffering has resulted in dogged opposition in parliament to deeper cuts, including within the ruling coalition. The Democratic Party of the Left, or DIMAR, one of three parties making up the coalition headed by Samaras, said it would abstain from the vote on the new round of austerity measures, turning in blank ballots. Still, it plans to vote Sunday to approve the government's new budget. Samaras' own center-right New Democracy party was expected to vote in favor of the package. Although the third coalition member -- the socialist party Pasok -- supports the cuts, individual party members came out against them. Radical leftist party Syriza, bitterly opposed to austerity and closely connected to Greek unions, called on its website for Greeks to demonstrate against the ""rape"" of democracy and the dashing of the hopes of the people. Samaras warned that if the measures didn't pass, international funds would not arrive and the nation could plunge into chaos. He pushed for Greece to receive more than the 31.5 billion euros expected in the latest installment ""so that there is a significant effect on the real economy."" Greece, and particularly Athens, has seen repeated street demonstrations against the austerity measures imposed on the nation, some of which have turned violent.

"(CNN) -- He was loved and admired all over the world for helping to end apartheid and heal the scars of a divided nation. But in his fight for total freedom, the liberation leader also devoted himself to another cause -- the empowerment of women. Here are five things Nelson Mandela did to advance female equality in his quest for justice. 1. Gender agenda . Although Mandela made tremendous strides in his battle to bring down apartheid, he recognized early on in his presidency that no major success was possible without gender equality. At the opening of the first parliament in 1994, President Mandela declared, ""Freedom cannot be achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression... Our endeavors must be about the liberation of the woman, the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child."" With the representation of women in South Africa's parliament jumping tenfold from 2.7% during apartheid to 27% after the first democratic elections of 1994, Mandela took action by appointing over a third of women to his cabinet. And today, females make up 44% of the country's politicians -- not far off from the government's goal to reach ""50/50 Gender Parity"" by 2015. One of the most prominent appointments was Frene Ginwala as the Speaker of the House. She secured this position throughout his presidency as well as the first term of President Thabo Mbeki. 2. Women of anti-apartheid era . In his celebrated autobiography ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" Mandela acknowledged men weren't alone in the anti-apartheid movement. In fact, the ANC Women's League played a critical role. One of the most memorable moments came on August 9, 1956, when 20,000 women marched to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest legislation requiring black women to carry passes in urban areas. ""The women were courageous, persistent, enthusiastic, indefatigable and their protest against passes set a standard for anti-government protest that was never equalled,"" Mandela wrote in his book. Almost 40 years after the protest, in 1994, he honored those women by declaring August 9 Women's Day, a national holiday. 3. Constitutional justice . For Mandela, democracy and gender equality were far from separate issues. In 1995, at the time of drafting South Africa's constitution, he said, ""As a tribute to the legions of women who navigated the path of fighting for justice before us, we ought to imprint in the supreme law of the land, firm principles upholding the rights of women. On International Human Rights Day in December 1996, Mandela signed the final draft of the country's constitution granting South Africa's women one of the most comprehensive set of rights in the world. South Africa's Constitution, states ""The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth."" It even called for the establishment of the Commission for Gender Equality, with the vision to create a ""society free from gender oppression and all forms of inequality."" 4. UN Convention . In 1993, a year before Mandela became South Africa's first democratically-elected president, the country signed the United Nations Convention to End All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Two years later, the rainbow nation later ratified the treaty while he was in office. Often referred to as an 'international bill of rights for women', the convention set out to end all forms of discrimination against women and still is yet to be ratified by the United States. 5. Speaking up for women . In 1996, Mandela gave a compelling speech on South Africa's Women's Day, calling for full equality and an end to sexual violence against women. Not blind to the challenges ahead, he remarked: ""As long as women are bound by poverty and as long as they are looked down upon, human rights will lack substance."" ""As long as outmoded ways of thinking prevent women from making a meaningful contribution to society, progress will be slow. As long as the nation refuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half of itself, it is doomed to failure."" But Mandela also went beyond rhetoric and took political action to improve the lives of women. During his presidency, he introduced free prenatal and postnatal care to mothers in the public health system as well as free health care to children up to the age of six. Though he was a firm believer in advancing women's rights, today South Africa faces many challenges, in terms of violence against women. In fact, over the years, Mandela often expressed his dismay over the struggle to achieve equality for women. However, this hurdle didn't stop Mandela and his third wife Graca Machel. The pair continued to work on this issue after he retired from office. And, while the rainbow nation has not yet fully lived up to Mandela's vision, he will remain an inspiration for all working towards social justice.","Mandela fought apartheid and advanced women's rights .

"Oh, weather, how moody you are! The temperature ups and downs are downright extreme in parts of Texas. In less than 24 hours, Dallas went from a high of 81 degrees Fahrenheit at Love Field to a low of 17 degrees Monday morning, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris reported. What's responsible for the sudden drop? A cold mass from Canada brought frigid air moving southeast across Texas, CNN meteorologist Todd Borek reported. Across the Southern Plains, temperatures Monday afternoon were 30 to 40 degrees below normal, Morris said. Sorry, fans of springtime: Temperatures are expected to remain below normal this week. Several more pushes of cold, arctic air will invade the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, Morris said. As of now, it seems the snowstorms won't be record-setting, but several weak systems will cause some travel headaches, Morris said. Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia all got hit by snow Monday, and the Midwest and Great Plains were put into the freezer. More than 2,950 U.S. flights had been canceled by Monday night, according to FlightAware.com, a flight tracking service. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport had canceled about 80% of its departing flights by Monday afternoon, and Philadelphia International Airport had nixed about a third of its schedule. Winter deals another blow to travelers . People were feeling pretty fed up on Monday amid the third major storm of winter. ""I can't believe it's March and it's still snowing,"" Betsy St. John, from Brunswick, Maryland, told CNN affiliate WHAG. ""I'm ready for spring."" This is a transitional season, and the most difficult time of year for meteorologists to put out an accurate forecast, Morris said. The federal government closed offices Monday in Washington, which expects rain, ice and 4 to 8 inches of snow. Congress postponed Monday business until Tuesday.  The Supreme Court was in session, however, hearing oral arguments and conducting other business. Public school systems from Dallas to Philadelphia canceled Monday classes.  Delaware, Tennessee and other states declared states of emergency.  Amtrak cut service around Wilmington, Delaware, CNN affiliate WJLA reported. There have been four weather-related auto fatalities. In Arkansas, a man was killed when he lost control of his SUV on Sunday in snowy weather and struck a retaining wall, the Arkansas State Police reported. In Oklahoma, a pedestrian was killed Saturday during freezing rain, the state's highway patrol reported. And in Macon County, Tennessee, two people died in a two-vehicle crash as it began to sleet Sunday night, according to preliminary information from Dayla Qualls with the Tennessee Highway Patrol. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency there because of the storm -- a move that will help state agencies position resources where they're needed, McAuliffe said. The capital, Richmond, is expected to get 4 to 8 inches of snow and sleet, according to the National Weather Service. McAuliffe said people in Virginia should postpone travel. Schools in parts of North Carolina are closed as the storm is expected to bring sleet and possibly snow later Monday, according to CNN affiliate WRAL. This storm is a national event that started out dumping rain on California, causing dangerous mudslides. It then moved east and delivered dangerous weather to places unfazed by typical winters. Extremely low temperatures hit the Northern Plains, Upper Midwest and Great Lakes again. Highs from the single digits to the low 20s are expected from Montana eastward to New England, and subzero lows are likely for the Dakotas and the Upper Midwest. Snow fell Sunday on Indianapolis, Louisville and St. Louis, where the weather caused numerous wrecks. Interstate 95 in northern Kentucky was shut down for a period Sunday. In Little Rock, Arkansas, thousands of people woke up without electricity. ""We've got about 2,600 workers on the ground ready to go just as soon as the trouble begins,"" David Lewis, a spokesman with Entergy Arkansas, told CNN affiliate KATV.  ""With the forecasts being as firm as they've been, we have every reason to believe this will be a significant and serious winter storm."" Power outages were reported in Arkansas (14,000); Memphis (20,000) and Nashville (9,500) in Tennessee; Missouri (360); Mississippi (1,500); and Louisville, Kentucky (309). iReport: Gnomes weather Arkansas sleet storm . The South will be cool but won't see much snow. There will be a slight risk of severe thunderstorms bearing damaging winds, a few isolated tornadoes and possibly large hail. People in Atlanta will feel temperatures in the 50s -- a big drop from Sunday's high of around 70. The string of winter storms left many jurisdictions around the country low on road-clearing supplies. In New Albany, Indiana, where salt is now in short supply, the city has shifted to a product called IMIX, which combines natural sand and calcium chloride, CNN affiliate WAVE reported. In Virginia, the state Department of Transportation has already exceeded its $10 million snow removal budget by $3.4 million, CNN affiliate WRIC reported Sunday. Rhode Island got a new shipment of salt right before the storm, reported WPRI, a CNN affiliate. Folks like Mariedith Poquiz of Frederick, Maryland, can't wait for the weather to warm up. ""I'm ready to break out my spring clothes,"" she told WHAG. ""I'm tired of the winter.""","Dallas temperatures drop from 81 to 17 in less than 24 hours .
Four people have died in weather-related accidents, police say .
Federal offices are closed Monday in Washington, except for Supreme Court .
Schools from Dallas to Philadelphia have been shut down ."
"Authorities in Kenya appeared close to ending a deadly siege Monday at an upscale Nairobi mall, where attackers have killed at least 68 people, injured 175, and are believed to still be holding about 10 people hostage. ""All efforts are underway to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion,"" the Kenyan military announced on Twitter. It said that ""most of the hostages have been rescued and security forces have taken control of most parts of the building."" Earlier, police had tweeted that a ""MAJOR assault"" by security forces was ongoing. The developments come some two days after Al-Shabaab militants first stormed the shopping center, spraying bullets and unleashing chaos. There are believed to be between 10-15 gunmen involved in the attack, officials said. Sources within Al-Shabaab told CNN that nine names listed on a Twitter site -- now suspended -- were people who were among the alleged hostage-takers. Three of the alleged attackers are from the United States, two are from Somalia and there is one each from Canada, Finland, Kenya and the United Kingdom, according to the list. The FBI is looking into the claim that American citizens were involved the attack, but have not confirmed that. Similarly, a senior State Department official said that the United States is trying to determine whether any of the alleged attackers are American. But, the official said, authorities are becoming more confident American citizens were involved. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed Sunday to hold those responsible for the violence, accountable. The tragedy is personal for the president; one of his nephews and his fiancee were among the dead. ""They shall not get away with their despicable, beastly acts. Like the cowardly perpetrators now cornered in the building, we will punish the masterminds swiftly and indeed very painfully,"" Kenyatta said. 'Bunch of cowards' Sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the day Sunday, and at least one explosion. Those sounds were followed by periods of tense silence. Soldiers kept vigil outside the mall, guns dangling from their shoulders. Later in the day, helicopters approached. The Kenyan Red Cross tweeted that nine bodies were recovered Sunday night, bringing the death toll to 68. More than 175 were injured in the attack, Kenyatta said. He and other Kenyan officials visited hospitals Sunday morning. ""No one should lose their life so needlessly, so senselessly and no family should have to receive news that their loved ones have been killed by a criminal bunch of cowards,"" the president said. The mall siege was the deadliest terror attack in Kenya since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy there in 1998, killing 213 people. Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia, claimed responsibility, and said it was not backing down. In a message on its Twitter feed, the group said ""all Muslims"" were escorted from the mall before the attack. ""When justice is denied, it must be enforced,"" it said in a tweet Sunday. ""Kenyans were relatively safe in their cities before they invaded us & killed Muslims #Westgate"" Since Kenya launched attacks against Al-Shabaab in Somalia in 2011, the group has hurled grenades at Kenyan churches, bus stops and other public places. Last year, the Kenyan military played a major role in handing Al-Shabaab forces a defeat when as part of a peacekeeping mission, they liberated the key Somali port of Kismayo. The attack Saturday targeted a popular weekend meeting spot. Kenyans and expatriates gather at the luxurious Westgate Shopping Mall on weekends to drink lattes, catch a movie or browse through the more than 80 stores. Many questions . Police in Kenya grew irritated as people took to social media to describe what they were seeing and hearing. ""If you must Facebook or tweet, then talk about football or your favourite music but NOT MISINFORM the public on security operations!"" authorities said on Twitter. Three injured security forces were taken out of the besieged mall, but the severity of their injuries was unclear. By Sunday afternoon, at least 1,000 people had been freed from the mall, Kenyatta said. But some 30 people were believed to still be held. Later, that number fell to no more than 10, military spokesman Cyrus Oguna told CNN affiliate KTN. ""The number that is still left in the building is very, very small,"" he said, without providing details on how people got out. One apparent hostage left the building Sunday, and said she had been hiding in the basement of the mall, KTN reported. Al-Shabaab vowed not to negotiate with Kenyan authorities. ""The Mujahideen are still strong inside #Westgate Mall and still holding their ground,"" the group tweeted late Saturday. Israeli special forces were at the scene and were working with their Kenyan counterparts in the hostage crisis, Kenyan government sources told CNN. Kenyatta said several nations had offered help but ""this remains an operation of the Kenya security agencies."" State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said there were reports of a white woman among the hostage takers. Kenyan intelligence officials were investigating the claims, he said. Esipisu was asked if the reported woman was thought to be the infamous Al-Shabaab-affiliated ""White Widow,"" Samantha Lewthwaite. ""Nothing is being ruled out,"" he said. But CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said it was unlikely. ""It would be very unusual for a woman to be involved in one of these operations,"" he said. ""Typically these groups are misogynist. Their view is the woman should be in a home and shrouded in a body veil."" Lewthwaite's husband, Germaine Lindsey, was one of the suicide bombers killed in the 2005 attack on London's transportation system. His Buckinghamshire-born widow is wanted by Kenyan authorities for her alleged role as an Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda-linked financier. A day of horror . The calm was shattered around noon local time Saturday. Gunshots erupted as shoppers picked up groceries, savored lunch and browsed through the racks at stores. Before long, pools of blood smeared pristine hallways. Bodies lay strewn across the floor. Uche Kaigwa-Okoye was sipping coffee when he heard what first sounded like a fallen table, then the continuing rat-a-tat of gunfire. As the gunshots became louder, screaming crowds headed for the exits. He joined 20 people who took shelter for about five hours in a women's bathroom cubicle. ""They had grenades, and it was really, really loud,"" he said of the attackers. He noticed tear gas in the hallways as well. ""All of us felt like they were close,"" he said. As people texted family and friends outside the mall, word spread that nobody could be trusted. And even if the good guys could be sorted from the bad guys, the intermittent barrages of gunfire made any escape attempt seem futile. Sara Head, a Washington resident, experienced similar horror in the mall's parking garage. As her car pulled up, she heard gunfire. She crawled underneath and hid behind cars before getting into a stairwell. Eventually, the stairwell lights came back on and the door to a nearby supermarket opened. She dashed through, passed a nearby loading dock and fled to safety. ""There was blood throughout the supermarket,"" Head said. ""It wasn't clear if it was OK to exit."" Several Kenyan agencies made a plea for blood donations. ""Hospitals are appealing for more blood, the response is incredible but more is needed,"" tweeted Francis Kimemia, secretary to the Cabinet. Foreigners among casualties . Most of the casualties are Kenyan, authorities said. But the mall is popular with expatriates and foreign nationals, who were among those killed and injured. Those killed include three British citizens, two French nationals and two Canadians, including a diplomat, their governments said. Several American citizens were among the wounded, including Elaine Dang, a University of California, Berkeley, graduate. Dang worked as the general manager for Eat Out Kenya, which confirmed her injuries on its Twitter and Facebook pages. A State Department spokeswoman said Sunday there were five Americans among the injured, but none among the dead. ""Obviously it's an enormous offense against everybody's sense of right and wrong,"" said Secretary of State John Kerry. ""It represents the seriousness and the breadth of the challenge we face with ruthless and completely reckless terrorists, and we're going to pursue them."" The U.S. Embassy asked personnel to stay in place Sunday and avoid the Westgate Mall area and any large gatherings. All U.S. citizens in Kenya were urged to register online so the embassy can provide them with updated information on travel and security -- and can contact them in case of emergency. Israel's Foreign Ministry said one national was slightly wounded and three escaped. A cafe at the mall is owned by an Israeli, but the ministry does not believe the mall was targeted because of that. The Ghana president's office said literary figure Kofi Awoonor was among those killed in the attack. ""Such a sad twist of fate to place Prof at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" President John Mahama said in a statement.","The number of hostages believed to be held drops to 10 or less .
Security forces are reported to have taken control of most of the mall .
Three of the alleged attackers are believed to be from the United States .
At least 68 people have been killed, another 175 injured ."
"(CNN)Even in their greatest moments of triumph, American presidents can make decisions that in the long run will devastate their legacies. We have seen this in recent times, such as with President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq. But the classic example was Lyndon Johnson's experience with Vietnam. Fifty years ago, when the 89th Congress convened in January 1965 following Johnson's landslide election victory against Sen. Barry Goldwater, LBJ was at the height of his political power. Liberal Democrats commanded huge majorities in both the House and Senate. The coalition of southern Democrats and Republicans had lost much of their power. Conservative Republicans were marginalized since nobody wanted to look anything like a protégé of Barry Goldwater. With the backing of a mass civil rights movement and organized labor, the White House was determined to push forward a huge domestic agenda ranging from Medicare to more anti-poverty programs to voting rights. Bills would soon be passing at a breathtaking pace as the nation saw Washington remake the social contract. But in these very same months, Johnson intensified America's involvement in the war against communism in Vietnam -- a war that would prove to be disastrous, devastating and arguably the aspect of his presidency that continues to define him more than anything else. The previous year Johnson had already strengthened the nation's commitment to the conflict in Southeast Asia. While President John F. Kennedy had increased the number of advisors working with the South Vietnamese in the fight against communist forces, Johnson set the groundwork for a much bigger intervention. He didn't do so with great confidence. In one of the most revealing White House recordings -- on May 27, 1964 -- he and Georgia Sen. Richard Russell, a southern hawk who was Johnson's mentor, have a lengthy conversation where both men express their doubts about whether this conflict was essential to the Cold War and whether it could ever be won.  Russell said that it's a ""damn worse mess that I ever saw."" Russell added, ""I don't see how we ever going to get out without fighting a major war...."" ""I just don't know what to do,"" said Johnson. Regardless, because of the political pressure that Johnson felt from Republicans who were attacking him as weak on defense and since he agreed to the logic of the domino theory -- that if one country fell to communism others would follow -- Johnson requested that Congress authorize the use of force through the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 4, 1964. Based on weak evidence about an attack on U.S. Navy destroyers (Johnson admitted that the attack, if it occurred, was a mistake or the result of a decision by a low-level commander), Johnson worked with Arkansas Sen. William Fulbright to convince Democrats to support him with this resolution. The resolution was ""like Grandma's nightshirt,"" Johnson said of the resolution, ""it covers everything."" Fulbright assured his colleagues that they needed to pass the resolution to protect Johnson from Republican attack. If he intended to actually use his full power to deploy force in the conflict, Fulbright said, he would return to Congress for their approval. He never did. On February 15, 1965, LBJ received encouragement from a former president about how he was handling the situation. When Johnson told him he was ""having hell,"" including with the situation in Vietnam, President Truman assured him it was fine. Johnson thought he could learn from how Truman handled his problems with Korea. He reminded Truman that as a senator he had sent a letter in support of his efforts in Korea, even when Republicans like Ohio Republican Robert Taft were ""raising hell"" in the Senate. Johnson said he was ""doing the best I can"", that when they ""go in and kill your boys you to hit back."" Truman, who said he was handling the challenges well, gave him support, agreeing that you ""bust them in the nose every time you get a chance"" and ""they understand that language better than any other kind."" But as the new year began other Democrats warned Johnson that he should not make use of this resolution for force. Two days after Johnson spoke with Truman, Vice President Hubert Humphrey implored the president in a lengthy and powerful memorandum to pull out. Humphrey argued that, for the first time, Johnson didn't have to fear Republicans attacking him as weak on defense. Liberals controlled Congress and he had just won a great landslide electoral victory. He could make a bold move and get out of this conflict before it was too late. ""Politically,"" Humphrey wrote, the Johnson administration is in a stronger position to do so than any Administration in this history."" But Johnson didn't listen to Humphrey's logic, and still feared the danger of being characterized as weak on defense just like Democrats had been in 1952 when they lost control of the White House and Congress. As Democrats in Congress spoke out against LBJ for Vietnam, he became more belligerent. He isolated Humphrey from his inner circle of advisors on foreign policy. He dismissed the criticism from Democrats and warned that they were giving propaganda support to the communists. We can hear this on a tape with one of Johnson's greatest allies in the Senate, Minority Leader Everett Dirksen. On February 17, 1965 , the two men discussed speeches that had been given by Idaho Sen. Frank Church and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern. Dirksen brought up how the two men had been ""teeing off"" against LBJ's Vietnamese policy. Dirksen thought Johnson needed some defense from his ""friend on the other side of the aisle."" Johnson told Dirksen that former President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, fully supported him. Johnson added that the kinds of speeches Church and McGovern were making posed the ""worst problem"" to the United States, more so than raids or ambushes or military accidents, since the speeches about the need for negotiation or withdrawal were used by the communists in pamphlets and newspapers. The statements undermined the confidence of the South Vietnamese government that the United States would continue to support them. At the same time that he spoke with such great bravado, he admitted to his advisors all of his fears and concerns.  On February 26, LBJ told Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara: ""I don't think anything is going to be as bad as losing, and I don't see any way of winning...."" On March 6, many months after their haunting conversation about what could likely happen in Vietnam, Johnson didn't sound much better. When explaining that he was preparing to send Marines into the conflict, Johnson they were ""getting in worse"" and admitted that: ""The great trouble I'm under, a man can fight if he can see daylight down the road somewhere. But there ain't no daylight in Vietnam."" In response Russell said, ""there's no end to the road."" During the very month that the House passed a sweeping version of Medicare and Medicaid and Congress prepared to send him an education bill to sign into law, Johnson got deeper into one of the most devastating military quagmires that the United States has ever faced. Johnson's fears of being pummeled by the right, combined with his adherence to the ""domino theory"" about communism, would gradually drive him deeper and deeper into a disastrous war. Presidents are complex beings. Sometimes the very qualities that allow them to make great breakthroughs in public policy, that greatly improve the condition of the country, also allow them to implement decisions that become highly destructive. ​ .","50 years ago the stage was set for decisions that doomed LBJ's presidency .

"An unexpected new proposal for international regulation of the internet drew warnings over the weekend of a spread of online censorship and left a global conference on the issue on the edge of collapse. The deep divisions over treatment of the internet came after a group of Arab states put forward a plan late on Friday that would require countries around the world to explicitly regulate internet companies. The proposal, made at a conference in Dubai to agree a new international telecoms treaty, has also won the backing of Russia and China, along with a group of other countries. The pitch for direct regulation came as an unwelcome surprise to delegations from the US and other countries that have supported the current light system of regulation for the internet. ""The conference has been hijacked by a group of countries that want to extend regulation of the internet,"" said one person familiar with the US position. ""This is completely unacceptable to the US point of view."" Although countries are already free to impose national regulations, the US and its allies argue that enshrining the approach in a treaty would extend international legitimacy to repressive regimes that want to limit internet communications, while also making it easier for countries to co-operate on censorship and other restrictive practices. Tariq al-Awadhi, head of the Arab states delegation, said that it made sense for internet companies to be included in the regulations since this would help force them to work together with network operators. ""They need to come to commercial agreements with one another anyway,"" he said. A number of countries in the Arab world and in Africa have argued that internet companies should hand over more of their revenues to the communications networks that carry their traffic in other countries. Traffic agreements are currently reached through direct negotiations between internet and network companies, an approach that the US maintains already allows for rates to be set at a fair level. The call for new regulation could lead to a break-down in the talks, according to people involved in the discussions. The US delegation will refuse to support anything that extends regulation in a way that damages internet freedom and has full backing from Washington to walk out on the talks if necessary, said the person familiar with the US position. The division has set the stage for tense talks in the early part of this week, with a final treaty due to be completed by Friday. ""We are going to sit together, and maybe we can come to a solution,"" said Mr Awadhi. ""Maybe the US has misunderstood our intentions, so we can explain and hear from their side why they have fear from this one, and we can maybe change our wording.""","An unexpected new proposal for international regulation of the internet drew warnings .

"Washington (CNN) -- Residents of the  LeDroit  Park, a low income area of Washington gathered at the neighborhood farm on Tuesday to meet with  British royalty. And, the Prince of Wales was happy to shake hands and talk  gardening. Prince Charles arrived in the  U.S. Tuesday afternoon for a  three-day visit that includes stops at the Supreme Court, Georgetown University and the White  House. The British Embassy says the visit will  highlight environmental sustainability and that's why he stopped by the Common  Good City Farm where they grow fruits and vegetables and supply it  to the low income residents of the community who can't afford healthy food. With the tomato plants in the ground and  the potatoes already up, many of those residents turned out to see the Prince,  take pictures, and congratulate him on the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of  Cambridge. His eldest son Prince William married  Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abby on Friday in what has been called the  largest celebration in London in decades. Prince Charles talked irrigation with the  farmers, and received from a young girl a bouquet of flowers that were grown on  the farm. Tomorrow, he will give the  keynote address at ""The Future of Food"" conference at Georgetown University on future sustainability of the  world's food system and the importance of resiliency of our ecosystem. Earlier Tuesday, the prince attended a  reception at the Supreme Court for Marshall Scholar alumni. The program is  funded by the British government to introduce top U.S.  college students to British culture. On Wednesday, Prince Charles will go to the  White House to meet with President Obama.","LeDroit  Park residents met Prince of Wales who shook hands and talked  gardening .

"One minute, Colin Patterson was watching TV. The next, he saw pianos flying through the air in the shop where he works as an explosion tore through the building. ""They flew off the ground,"" said the piano technician, who also lives in the building in Manhattan's East Harlem. He told CNN affiliate WABC that he crawled through the rubble and managed to escape unharmed. At least four people were killed in the massive explosion and fire Wednesday that leveled Patterson's building and the one beside it. Nine people remained missing hours after the blast, city officials said. Firefighters were still frantically picking through rubble in search of survivors. Authorities say they think a gas leak was to blame, but they haven't determined an official cause yet. The massive explosion and fire leveled two five-story apartment buildings. At least 63 people were reported injured. More fatalities appeared likely. Fire officials reported that two survivors suffered life-threatening injuries. Near 116th Street and Park Avenue, once the heart of New York's large Puerto Rican community, about a dozen firefighters tore at two-story-high mounds of bricks in a search for survivors from the two buildings, which housed a piano store and an evangelical church in addition to apartments. As gas and electric utility workers tore up pavement in an effort to shut gas lines, people gathered in the streets, many crying. ""This is a tragedy of the worst kind,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said, ""because there was no indication in time to save people."" Call about gas leak proceeded blast . Con Ed spokesman Bob McGee said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. The call came from a resident at one of the newer buildings on Park Avenue. The utility dispatched a truck two minutes later, but it arrived after the explosion, the spokesman said. Edward Foppiano, the utility's senior vice president of gas operations, said the cause of the blast was being treated as a gas leak, though there was no evidence of that yet. A routine service check, involving a truck with special equipment, detected no gas leaks on February 28, he said. Foppiano said one of the buildings had a gas leak in May 2013, which was repaired the following month. A building department official said one of the two Park Avenue buildings that collapsed received a city permit last year for the installation of 120 feet of gas piping. The work was completed last June. In 2008, owners of the adjacent building, which also collapsed, were fined for failing to maintain vertical cracks in the rear of the building. The condition was not reported as corrected to the buildings department. There were a total of 15 units in the two buildings, officials said. Building department records detailed a litany of violations, dating back decades, for one of the collapsed buildings, including a lack of smoke detectors, blocked fire escapes and faulty light fixtures. The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates pipeline explosions, said it was sending investigators to New York. The mayor told reporters that the report of the gas leak, which he said came about 15 minutes before the explosion, was ""the only indication of danger."" Longtime resident, public safety officer among victims . Marisela Frias, 44, tried unsuccessfully to call her 67-year-old aunt, Carmen Tanco, a second-floor resident of one of the collapsed buildings for more than two decades. Frias called and called her aunt's cell number but got no answer, she said. ""Always she answers right away and if she misses it because she didn't get to in time, she calls me right back,"" Frias said. ""Calling nonstop and it goes straight to voice mail, which never ever, ever, ever in my years -- and I'm 44 -- of knowing her, ever cannot get ahold of her. ... All I want to know is she's OK."" Later Wednesday, Frias told CNN that her aunt had died in the blast. Another one of the victims was a public safety officer at Hunter College, the school said on its website. ""We are sad to report that, in an explosion that destroyed two buildings in East Harlem this morning, we have lost a member of the Hunter family. Sgt. Griselde Camacho, a public safety officer at Hunter since 2008, who worked in the Silberman School of Social Work building, died in the explosion,"" the statement said. ""Our hearts go out to Griselde's family at this terrible time."" The name of the other person who died in the blast was not immediately released. The injured included two FBI agents who were in the vicinity of the explosion, said New York FBI spokesman Chris Sinos. The injuries were not life-threatening. Blast shook Manhattan for blocks . One woman tried in vain to find her husband, Jordy Salas, who may have been on the second floor of one of the collapsed buildings. She fainted and was taken to a hospital. ""We're expending every effort to locate each and every loved one,"" de Blasio told reporters at the scene. ""Hopefully we'll find that some of them are in other parts of the city and have just not been located yet."" Neighbors: Blast sounded like a bomb . Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said responding firefighters barely missed the blast. ""If we were here five minutes earlier we may have had some fatalities among firefighters,"" he said. ""Not being here may have saved some lives."" A new problem complicated search efforts Wednesday night, as a sinkhole in front of the collapsed buildings stopped firefighters from accessing some of the wreckage. ""Heavy equipment, required to remove additional debris, cannot be brought to the scene unit the sinkhole is mitigated,"" the New York Fire Department said. ""That mitigation is in process and will likely take several hours."" Clouds of dark smoke rose over the largely residential area of redbrick tenements and small businesses after the explosion, which some residents said sounded like a bomb. Hundreds of firefighters responded, many spraying water on the roaring blaze from ladders. Metro North commuter rail service was suspended as debris from the explosion landed on the elevated tracks across the street, authorities said. Service was restored later Wednesday, with trains running at reduced speed near the blast site. ""I heard a big explosion,"" said a resident who identified herself as Angelica. ""I didn't know what was going on. ... My neighbors came banging on my door, telling me to get out. I guess they were evacuating the building.  And I couldn't get out.  My door was jammed. Everything on my windowsill fell. I guess the impact of the explosion jammed the door as well."" She added, ""It was extremely loud. I couldn't even explain it to you, if I could. It was just so loud. It woke me out of my sleep. That's how loud it was."" Molley Mills, who lives nearby, said at the time of the explosion her building rumbled as if the subway was passing beneath it. ""I went outside my terrace and there was smoke pouring out,"" she said. The New York police bomb squad responded to the scene, according to a law enforcement source. Once a predominantly Italian neighborhood, the stretch of East Harlem saw a large influx of Puerto Ricans in the 1950s. It went on to be called Spanish Harlem. In the 1990s, many Mexican immigrants began to move into the area, which has been gentrified in recent years, with many mom-and-pop shops replaced by restaurants and bars. CNN first learned of this story via Twitter.","At least nine people are unaccounted for hours after the blast, city officials say .

"Three quickfire goals in extra time gave Real Madrid a 4-1 win over city rivals Atletico in Lisbon Saturday to win the European Champions League for the 10th time. Diego Godin put Atletico ahead in the 36th minute and it took an injury time equalizer from Sergio Ramos to rescue Real and force the extra half hour. Atletico held out until the second half of the added time until Gareth Bale headed Real ahead after superb work by Angel Di Maria. Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo, with a penalty, his record 17th goal in the Champions League this season, rubbed salt into the wound for Atletico, who had been bidding for a La Liga/Champions League double. Coach Diego Simeone, unhappy at the added minutes in regulation play, summed up their frustration as he ran on to the pitch to confront Real's Raphael Varane after the final goal and had to be restrained by stewards. It was a sorry end to a magnificent season for Los Rojiblancos, but ultimately the quality of Real, epitomized by the world's most expensive player Bale, which prevailed. It was the Welshman's 22nd goal of the season and sixth in the Champions League but surely the most important of his career. ""This is what every footballer dreams of and it doesn't come any bigger than that,"" the Welshman told Sky Sports after his side's triumph. For Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti it was his third Champions League triumph as a coach, equaling the record of Liverpool's Bob Paisley. His counterpart Simeone had gambled on the fitness of his star striker Diego Costa, who has been hampered by a hamstring injury, but it backfired when the Spanish international limped off after nine minutes. He was replaced by Adrian Lopez but Atletico initially took his departure in its stride, frustrating Real's attacking menace in a scrappy first half. It came to life in a passage of play which first saw Bale poke an effort wide of the post after running through the Atletico defense. The Real fans in the Stadium of Light looked skywards in disbelief but they were soon in total despair after a mistake by Spanish international goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Real failed to clear a corner which was lifted back into the area and Uruguay's Godin beat the onrushing Casillas to the ball to score with a flicked header. Casillas desperately scrambled back to make amends for his error of judgment but could not keep the ball out of the net. World Player of the Year Ronaldo had been kept quiet in the first half but was more prominent after the break, forcing Thibaut Courtois to make a fine save from a free kick then narrowly failing to connect with a header in front of goal. Bale also started to live up to his price tag, charging through from the right before scuffing his effort wide, while a combination with Ronaldo saw another chance to begging. But with time running out, Ramos connected perfectly with a Luka Modric corner to add to his two goals from the semifinal win over defending champions Bayern Munich and give his side a precious lifeline, of which it took full advantage. It was Real's first Champions League title since 2002 and to the milestone of 'La Decima"" -- extending its record number of wins in Europe's premier club competition.","Real Madrid wins Champions League .

"(CNN) -- He has been at the center of Asia's biggest sex scandal, but now actor Edison Chen has broken his silence on the public episode that has ended careers and caused him to face at least one reported death threat. Internet sex photos of Edison Chen and starlets caused a huge media storm and fall from grace for many. Talking exclusively to CNN on his return to Hong Kong, where he had been forging a career in the movies, Chen reveals his side of the scandal that broke in early last year when hundreds of sexually explicit photos of Chen with other celebrities turned up on the Internet. ""There's been a lot of talk through the past year and a half about this or that and a lot of rumors, a lot of hearsay, and I feel, you know, I've kept quiet just to kind of respect everyone and respect the law,"" Chen told CNN. A Hong Kong computer technician was sentenced to more than eight-and-a-half months in jail for dishonestly obtaining access to the intimate photos when Chen sent his computer in for repairs. But it is still unclear exactly how the images made their way to the web. Watch the full exclusive TV interview with Edison Chen online » . The photographs caused shock in Hong Kong and across Asia, with around 1,300 salacious images fueling front page news for tabloids for weeks. There was also a huge public backlash against the 28-year-old who has been one of the rising young stars of Asia cinema. After the scandal broke, Chen, who admitted taking the photos, announced his retirement from Hong Kong's entertainment business and fled to his native Canada. Added to the media attention, Chen says he faced death threats. A bullet was sent to a TV station in Hong Kong earlier this year warning the entertainer to stay out of the limelight. While Chen issued his own apology for any hurt or embarrassment caused soon after the photos surfaced, he maintains he suffered as well. ""I believed I was a victim. I believed that I was hurt by this a lot. I believed that...I knew that I had nothing to do with the spreading of these photos,"" he told CNN in the exclusive interview. ""I can't say I didn't do anything wrong. I've admitted that I was wrong, and I wouldn't say sorry if I wasn't wrong. But I also believe that at the same time that I wasn't the perpetrator, and I had suffered a lot from this as well."" Chen has suffered a spectacular fall from grace and some of the starlets in the photos have endured public disgrace in this culturally conservative region. For some, careers have been left in ruins. Chen says he has not spoken to any of the women identified in the photos since the scandal broke. ""Initially it was because I couldn't find them. Secondly, it was because I didn't really know how to approach and really what to say to be honest with you,"" Chen told CNN. Cecilia Cheung was one of the actresses identified in the photos and in a recent interview, she had strong criticism for Chen. ""I wasn't allowed to talk to her in the initial because of the police request and they were investigating me...I had so much things on my mind,"" said Chen. ""I'm not trying to say that that justifies any wrongdoing that she thinks I've done to her. But I hope that she can understand, and I hope that she can forgive me either today or one day, and she'll understand that I had my difficulties, and I really, really never wished this to happen upon anyone, and I still respect her.""

"For decades, prosecutors say, Johann (John) Breyer had successfully eluded a dark past. In his twilight years, the 89-year-old Philadelphia man was forced to defend himself against accusations that he was more than a mere perimeter guard at the notorious Auschwitz camp, where more than 1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed during World War II. He maintained that he never persecuted anyone. In 2003, a U.S. court ruled that he was not responsible for joining a Nazi unit because he was only 17 years old at the time. But new evidence has emerged, U.S. and German prosecutors say, that shows Breyer had to have been involved in the crimes that occurred in that place. Breyer, who has lived in the United States since the 1950s, is facing possible extradition to Germany following his arrest Tuesday in Philadelphia, authorities said. Federal Magistrate Judge Timothy R. Rice on Wednesday ordered him held without bail, pending an extradition hearing in late August. ""Extradition is traditionally a very long and complicated process,"" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""It's always possible to fight extradition. It just often takes a long time."" German authorities alleged that Breyer served in the Nazi ""Death's Head Guard Battalion"" from 1943 to 1945 at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau concentration camp and at another location, according to court papers. German authorities have charged Breyer with complicity in the murder of more than 216,000 European Jews from Hungary, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, who were forcibly deported to Auschwitz, in southern Poland, on 158 trains between May and October 1944, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Little is known about Breyer's life in the United States, where he most recently lived with family in a redbrick row house in northeast Philadelphia. In court this week, Breyer's lawyer described his client as old, frail, sick and weak, according to CNN affiliate KYW. ""One of the core issues, how can the German government or any government charge someone with a crime so long after the actual crime?"" Toobin said. ""How can you have the evidence? How can you put on witnesses? How can you prove what happened in the 1940s?"" The U.S. case against Breyer dates to the 1990s, when federal authorities sought to strip him of his U.S. citizenship, arguing that Nazis were not eligible. At the time, Breyer admitted to the U.S. Department of Justice that he served as an armed guard at the Buchenwald concentration camp, in Germany, and was later transferred to Auschwitz. According to the current complaint, Breyer told U.S. authorities in 1991 that he was a perimeter guard and may have fired into the air occasionally. He also stated that on three or four occasions he marched prisoners to construction sites outside the camp complex. He told authorities he heard that people would be cremated and saw smoke but did not know how the prisoners had died, the complaint said. He is quoted in court papers as saying Auschwitz was ""a terrible camp"" where ""something is going on there."" He allegedly said he knew people were being cremated and saw smoke. The new complaint states that Breyer was promoted at least once while stationed at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau, and granted leave to visit his German hometown twice, once in April 1944 and another time in January 1945. The complaint explains that such benefits were not afforded to guards who had refused to perform the full range of duties of an SS ""Death's Head Battalion"" guard. It was common knowledge among guards that prisoners unfit for labor were gassed and their bodies burned, according to the documents. Breyer got his original claim to U.S. citizenship from his mother, who was born in Manayunk, Pennsylvania, and who returned with her family to Germany before World War I. After World War II, Breyer migrated to the United States in 1952 and claimed citizenship as a displaced person. In the court documents submitted to the federal magistrate this week, Breyer is said to have made statements since 1951 that are ""highly inconsistent with each other and are contrary to existing historical records and other credible evidence."" Authorities allege that he deliberately made false statements to minimize his role in the Holocaust. A spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League who is also a Holocaust survivor praised the long-running efforts that led to Breyer's arrest. ""We applaud the German and American governments for their commitment to ensuring that, while justice may be delayed, perpetrators of the Holocaust will be pursued to the end, no matter how long it takes,"" Abraham H. Foxman, the Anti-Defamation League National Director, said in a statement. ""We are especially grateful for the tireless efforts of the U.S. Department of Justice, which has long sought an order of deportation against Breyer, who served in the Nazi SS as a guard at two notorious concentration camps during World War II,"" said Foxman. Breyer's extradition hearing is scheduled for August 21. Owner of art collection suspected to contain Nazi loot dies .

"(CNN)When last we saw Kevin Spacey's ruthless Frank Underwood, he had just schemed and backstabbed his way from Congress to the Oval Office. But there's a reason the show is called ""House of Cards."" Even as newly sworn President Underwood, his grip on power will no doubt remain precarious. ""You want to know what takes real courage?"" he asks in the new trailer for Season 3 of Netflix's hit drama ""House of Cards,"" coming next month. ""Holding it all together when the stakes are this high."" Only 45 seconds long, the trailer teases more than it reveals. In a menacing, David Fincheresque style -- all dark palette and jittery score -- it suggests that things will not go smoothly for the new president and his Lady Macbeth of a first lady, played by Robin Wright.

"While boycott petitions against ""Duck Dynasty"" home A&E take off, the network itself is staying quiet. Since its Wednesday decision to ""indefinitely"" suspend Phil Robertson, one of the stars of its highly rated reality series, A&E has yet to publicly clarify what the future of the show might be, what they'll do with their block of reruns, or even what it really means to be ""indefinitely"" suspended. The network's lack of communication has done nothing to stem the tide of detractors who strongly disagree with its decision to put Robertson on the bench over remarks quoted in GQ magazine, in which he called homosexuality a sin, citing the Bible. A Change.org petition demanding that Robertson be reinstated and the network issue an apology was steadily climbing toward 100,000 signatures Friday. A separate petition at a website called IStandWithPhil.com makes a similar appeal. Hosted by the online community Faith Driven Consumers, the website helps its members spend their money with companies that fall in line with their spiritual beliefs. The petition on IStandWithPhil.com had surpassed 130,000 signatures by Friday evening. Those who've signed the IStandWithPhil.com petition are asking for their ""views (to) be treated with equality and respect in America's rich rainbow of diversity,"" and for the ""network to immediately reinstate Mr. Robertson to 'Duck Dynasty,' and to formally apologize to him, his family, and the millions of viewers who tune in every week, stand by him, and share his worldview."" ""While the LGBT community may be offended by his opposing viewpoint,"" that webstite continues, ""your rash, discriminatory, and unfair treatment toward Mr. Robertson -- a recognized symbol of the faith community -- is a slap in the face to Faith Driven Consumers and everyday Americans alike."" Both websites are urging people not to watch A&E programming in the meantime. So far, the number of petitioners doesn't compare with the millions that ""Duck Dynasty"" has drawn to A&E -- its fourth-season premiere in August set a record with 11.8 million watching, and the season finale in October brought in 8.4 million -- but those signatures would give any network exec flop sweat. Especially when the rest of the Robertson family has stoked the fire with a statement that suggests the future of the show might be in jeopardy. ""We have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm,"" the family said in a statement. ""We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of 'Duck Dynasty.'"" According to CNN Senior Media Correspondent Brian Stelter, conventional wisdom in the industry holds that this current disagreement between A&E and the family will resolve itself in time, in part because the two sides benefit so much from being in business with the other. A person with close ties to A&E noted that the Robertson family is under contract, thereby reducing the chances that the family will show up on another channel anytime soon. An A&E executive who spoke to Stelter on condition of anonymity, because the channel was avoiding any new public comments about the controversy, said that conversations with the Robertson family would likely resume after the Christmas holiday. ""Everybody just needs to take a breath,"" the executive said. The A&E executive insisted that there has been no second-guessing at the channel about the decision to suspend Phil Robertson. All of which gives rise to the question: What would happen to A&E were ""Duck Dynasty"" to go away? This is, after all, the show that helped the network to raise its total viewership 10% this year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Stelter can't see the Robertsons or A&E wanting to end the televised hunting-business fun so soon, but if it were to happen, it would undoubtedly be a blow to the network, he said. ""There's just nothing else on the channel that's nearly as popular as new episodes of 'Duck Dynasty,'"" Stelter said. ""It would be like AMC losing new episodes of 'The Walking Dead' or like Fox losing 'American Idol.' That's why it is very, very unlikely. The show is hugely important for the channel and for the family. Not just Phil, but the whole family,"" which, Stelter notes, isn't affected by the suspension. Given that Robertson is ""a main character"" on the fifth season, which is scheduled to premiere January 15, Stelter believes the increased attention thanks to the uproar might even give ""Duck Dynasty"" a ratings boost in 2014. But if something were to happen to the show in the long run, then yes, A&E would certainly need to regroup. On the other hand, it's not like the network hasn't bounced back before -- and it's never been a one-show network.  Over the past 10 years alone, it's transitioned from being the prime place to find a rerun of ""Biography"" to the home of the Emmy-winning ""Intervention,"" to the site of reality shows like ""Storage Wars"" as well as original programming like ""Bates Motel."" In October, A&E unveiled a new branding strategy centered around the tagline ""Be Original."" The campaign, The Hollywood Reporter noted at the time, was scheduled to debut during -- what else? -- a ""Duck Dynasty"" special on December 11. And yet, as industry trade Variety emphasizes, it is not unusual for a network to make a bold move in severing ties with a controversial figure, no matter how popular. MSNBC bid adieu to Alec Baldwin after the actor fired off another unprintable outburst at a photographer, and the Food Network declined to renew its contract with one of its most well-known personalities, Paula Deen, after she admitted to using the ""N"" word in the past. A&E itself previously put another fan-favorite reality star, Duane ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" Chapman, on hiatus after he used a racial slur. With its response to the ""Duck Dynasty"" situation, the network ""has been able to establish its progressive corporate values, maintain its relationship with advertisers, and not collapse an entire reality show in the process,"" Variety TV reporter AJ Marechal observes. ""The bullet wasn't entirely dodged, but it at least didn't hit a main artery.""","Two online petitions are encouraging people not to watch A&E .

"At the heart of the largest natural grassland in Europe lies the Hortobagy National Park -- a stunning slice of rural Hungary that's home to a strange array of beasts. The park, 800 square kilometers of pastures, marshes and bird-filled meadows, was awarded World Heritage status in 1999, and is managed by centuries-old farming practices. Stock herders and csikos horsemen -- Hungary's answer to cowboys -- oversee breeds of curly-haired pig and scimitar-horned cattle. Here's how to experience the best animal attractions in Hungary's wild east: . Puszta safari . To ride a safari bus out into the puszta -- loosely translated as ""barren land"" but actually 250 acres of rich, fenced-in pasture -- is to take a trip several thousand years into the past. The puszta teems with prehistoric beasts that, long before the arrival of man, roamed central Europe's grasslands and beyond. There are free-living herds of rare Przewalski's horses and wild asses. Jurassic Park-style scientific back-breeding has also brought back herds of massive-horned auroch cattle . Ancient predators, including wolves, wild cats and jackals, which once roamed the plains, now stalk these spacious enclosures. There are also aviaries holding eagles, vultures and, oddly, pelicans. Hortobagy Wild Animal Park, Hortobagy--Malomhaza; +36 52 589 000; daily safaris . Fishponds railway . The narrow-gauge Hortobagy-Halasto railway carries passengers through 16 square kilometers (4,000 acres) of ponds, lakes and marshes. The ponds were dug by hand in the early 20th century for rearing fish but have since reverted to wilderness and become one of Europe's most important wetlands. For birders there are small delights, such as pygmy cormorants, blue throats and bearded tits, as well as spectacular flocks of spoonbills, avocets and marsh harriers, which can be seen from watchtowers, hides and boardwalks. Hortobagy Fishpond & Narrow-Gauge Railway; +36 52 589 000 . Puszta Zoo . The Allatpark isn't so much a zoo as a farm experience featuring the puszta's unique breeds of livestock in an activity center where visitors can try their hand at traditional rural skills. There are opportunities to get close to scimitar-horned Hungarian gray cattle, dreadlocked Racka sheep with spiraling horns, and Mangalica pigs sporting long russet curls. ''Curly"" domestic animals are a Hungarian passion, with local pigeons, geese and dogs all having been given the perm treatment through selective breeding. Allatpark visitors can try cracking a drover's whip, throwing a ""rabbit stick"" at wooden bunnies, lassoing a bull's horns and drawing water from a ""sweep well."" Puszta Rare Breed Park/Puszta Zoo, Hortobagy; +36 52 701 037 . Bird hospital . Madarpark, an infirmary for treating avian injuries in the village of Hortobagy, is a positive response to the bleak reality of car hits, orphaned fledglings and accidents caused by electricity cables. Rescued and injured birds are predominantly big raptors. Visitors can watch through the glass wall of the hospital theater as wings and legs are reset. There are also platform viewing points in the walk-through aviaries where birds, including huge white-tailed eagles and storks, learn or re-learn, to fly. Falconry demonstrations and an ""eagle flight simulator"" (a zipline ride that involves being suspended from a giant eagle figure) are also offered. Hortobagy Bird Park, 6 Petofi Square, Hortobagy; +36 52 369 181 . Hortobagy festivals . Hortobagy holds annual celebrations of every aspect of traditional and natural life, and most involve animals. The agricultural year starts in late April when shepherds, swineherds and cattle drovers, all in full costume, drive their animals onto the puszta for the summer. In June, there are national competitions for herdsmen, csikos horsemen and other equestrians. In the fall, tens of thousands of cranes congregate at the Fishponds, prompting a festival in their honor. Trick riding exhibitions . The skills of Hungary's whip-cracking horsemen have their roots in the tribes of Central Asia, and a history of herding and banditry. Horses were trained to lie flat in the grass to make them ""disappear"" in exposed country while riders' saddles were designed for quick getaways. The most spectacular of these ""Wild East"" cowboys skills is more modern and involves standing on the backs of two galloping horses while controlling another three thundering along in front. Such flamboyant displays can be seen on trips involving a horse-drawn carriage ride into the pastures from Hortobagy's Mata Stud. Mata Stud, Hortobagy-Mata; +36 52 589 369 . Herdsmen Museum . Not so much about the animals as the way of life they've inspired, this museum shows and explains the traditions of Hungary's herders. Information here includes snippets such as the fact that horsemen use indigo ""skirts"" worn over breeches and boots to cope with winter cold and summer heat. And who knew that a tanned ram's scrotum makes a perfect tobacco pouch? There's also help deciphering semaphore-style messages using the gantry arms of water wells that the locals set to alert others to outlaws, or dinner. The museum isn't just a glimpse into the past. Outside, there are herders and csikos who still carry, use or wear what's on exhibit inside. Herdsmen Museum, Hortobagy, 1 Petofi Square; +36 52 369 040 .

"The deal reached with the Iranians late Saturday in Geneva represents a risk well worth taking by the Obama administration and the five other powers that negotiated it with the Iranians. If the Obama administration briefly got some first-term international diplomatic credit for the suggestion it would hit the ""reset"" button on relations with Russia, for this, its most important second-term initiative to date, it has opted for the ""hold"" button. The deal is an interim agreement by which Tehran has consented to freeze efforts that could lead to the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for modest relief from international economic sanctions. Now that an interim deal has been reached, the Iranians cannot move closer to a bomb as talks proceed. Even skeptics who don't trust Iran and fear it has been moving ever closer to gaining nuclear weapons capability must acknowledge that if this deal slows Iran down at all, it serves a useful purpose. If it does not, but intensive negotiations continue as a result of it, then we are at least no worse off than we were in the first place. Obama: Iranian deal limits ability to create nuclear weapons . Further, if at the end of the ensuing negotiating phase no deal is reached, taking military action would be seen as more justified given that diplomatic options were exhausted. That said, this deal has other little-noted or discussed implications and dimensions at many levels beyond the letter of its terms. For example, despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's advance denunciations of the deal -- struck between Iran and a group of international powers led by the United States -- he deserves as much credit for the deal as anyone else. His incessant banging on the drums of war led the world to believe that absent some diplomatic agreement soon, military action by the Israelis or the U.S. would be inevitable. The deal struck Saturday in Geneva was as much to freeze Israel's edging toward war as it was to freeze Iran's nuclear program. For Israel, despite its apprehensiveness about the arrangement, to strike Iran now would make it an international pariah. For the Obama administration, the deal offers multiple advantages. For the near term, at least, it is a rare diplomatic triumph. It arguably validates its program of sanctions by suggesting that the economic measures drove the Iranians to the negotiating table. But in addition, it not only forces Netanyahu to at least sit on his hands for awhile; it avoids the awkward situation of having to choose between supporting Israel (and inviting a major conflict in the region into which it would like be drawn) and appearing weak on Iran. For the Iranians, the deal provides some relief from the hardships associated with the sanctions -- estimates run in excess of $10 billion and some suggest the impact might be multiples of that. (Europeans, Russians and the Chinese all also have been hoping for anything that might promise a restoration of economic ties with the oil-rich nation.) But the deal also gives Iran useful negotiating leverage as it seeks to influence the outcome in neighboring Syria, where the embattled Assad administration is an important ally. Not only has it produced a more robust diplomatic dialogue with the Iranians, but now that the six nations that are engaged in this deal have a stake in it producing a positive outcome, they are less likely to inflame the Iranians or put them on the defensive with a Syria deal that is seen by them as a defeat. Of course, the critical question will be whether the next phase of negotiations for which this deal clears the way will produce a real breakthrough, a verifiable program for dismantling those elements of Iran's nuclear program that might allow it to develop nuclear weapons.  If it did, it would be a rarity, one of the few recent instances where diplomacy succeeded in  stopping a nation that wanted nukes from getting or keeping them. But it would not address the myriad other areas in which Iran has been helped inglame the problems of the Middle East during the past several decades.  It would not impact its state sponsorship of terror. It would not impact its efforts to extend its influence via support for regimes and political actors--from Syria to Iraq to Lebanon to Gaza;  indeed, as noted earlier, it might help them in this respect. And what's more, if it gave the U.S. a greater stake in a better relationship with Iran, it might also complicate relations with the Gulf States and the Israelis who see Iran as a threat. What's more, if the interim deal does not result in a longer term deal, what would happen next? Would war then be the only option? More sanctions? Would the absence of military action in that case suggest it would never come? The Geneva deal is a genuine diplomatic step forward. If it delays or reduces the risk of Iran gaining nuclear weapons and triggering an arms race in the region, it will be even more than that.

"Are you starting to take for granted the popping colors and hyper-detail of your HDTV? Fear not. 4K television is on the way, with screens that promise four times better resolution than today's best high-definition offerings. A standard high-definition TV has a 1080p resolution, meaning more than 2 million pixels per frame. The new wave of 4K TVs have more than 8.8 million pixels, providing greater accuracy of detail; clearer, sharper pictures; and greater contrast and color than regular HD. So far Sony is leading the pack with a giant 4K model already on the market with others hitting stores soon. But other manufacturers aren't far behind, meaning some living rooms might soon feel a lot more like going to the theater for a blockbuster. Sony is hoping that consumers will be willing to pay for that experience. Last fall, the electronics giant unveiled a 4K television that measured 84 inches diagonally and cost a hefty $25,000. Now, they're rolling out smaller and less expensive models, as well. The knock so far has been that there's not very much content out there yet that can actually take advantage of 4K's higher-def display. But Sony says it's working on that, too, as the technology becomes more mainstream. ""The digital cinema set started to focus on 4K. Even films that are being shot in 4K, you're going to the movie theater and not even realizing it,"" Rob Manfredo, a Sony spokesman, said. ""They are showing you an upscale version of that movie on a 4K projector. Because movies and the movie theater experience has gone in that direction and consumers want that same experience in their homes, it was a logical step for us."" Manfredo said that with fewer consumers purchasing televisions under 40 inches, bigger is becoming standard and the resolution had to improve. Sony will release 65-inch and a 55-inch versions that can be in homes starting this month, coupled with a video player set for release in June that can show movies produced in 4K. ""What 4K allows is for bigger screens to look just as good as they're supposed to and allow consumers to get closer to the TV for a more immersive, home theater experience -- something more similar to what it's like to go to the movies,"" Manfredo said. While Sony is the most prominent company getting into 4K, they're not alone. Chinese tech company OEM Seiki is rolling out a cheaper 4K television for $1,500. It doesn't have many fancy features, which accounts for the price, and it comes on the heels of other simple and cheap offerings out of China. LG, Sharp, Panasonic and Samsung have all turned heads with eye-popping displays at tech gatherings, as well. The 4K picture starts with the camera, which can capture details better than standard HD cameras. Manfredo said the image sensor in the 4K camera is far larger than an average video capture device. But don't think of this like Peter Jackson's attempt at 48 frames per second with ""The Hobbit,"" which was jarring for some viewers. Manfredo said the amount of digital data being captured with 4K cameras is the main difference. The end product with a 4K camera and television is going to visually be clearer, crisper and more detailed than something shot at 48 frames per second, he says. The ""wizard behind the curtain"" in the 4K television is a multichip processor called the 4K X-Reality PRO Picture Engine. Not only does it render native 4K into a sharper picture, but it also analyzes frame-by-frame non-4K signals to get them to look as good as possible. That means even content not shot in 4K will look better, Manfredo said. ""If you are watching a Blu-Ray, which is as pristine as it's going to get for 1080p resolution, it's going to upscale it to pretty darn near 4K,"" he said. ""If you are watching a 720p broadcast of ESPN, it may not get as close, but it's going to look a lot better."" Right now, there are no cable channels or satellite providers offering 4K broadcasts, but Sony is in talks with DirectTV, DISH and FIOS about adding those channels. A new 4K video player is coming out in June that will include 10 movies and 40-50 shorts rendered in 4K resolution. Later this summer, Sony is launching a digital download service offering a wider variety of 4K content. Manfredo said there are more than 100 movies in native 4K resolution. When the 84-inch 4K television was revealed last fall, many said it was too big -- both the size of the screen and the price tag -- to appeal to the home consumer. Manfredo said Sony has been able to reduce the costs to something comparable to the cost of a premium HD television. ""For $5,500, you can have a 4K television and 4K movies in your house come June of this year,"" he said. While major motion picture companies have been leading the charge to 4K, home film makers can make their own 4K movies or pictures if their camera is good enough. Manfredo said technically, any digital camera that is higher than 8 megapixels is considered 4K. ""But no one has a television in their house that was able to see all that resolution their cameras were picking up,"" he said. ""(4K TVs) can let you see the pictures as you saw them.""","New wave of 4K TVs offers picture four times sharper than HD .

"The future of science and technology sounds so promising.  Unprecedented advances in computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, genetics, neuroscience and biotechnology hold the potential to radically transform our world for the better and create mass abundance for all. I sincerely want to believe in this techno-utopian vision of things to come, but my work as a police officer and global security strategist working in more than 70 countries around the world has taught me that there is a darker side to these emerging technologies. The criminal underground is highly innovative and often acts as an early adopter of emerging technologies. As a young police officer, I observed gang members and drug dealers using beepers and mobile phones, long before they were in common use by the general public.  Today, criminals are even building their own encrypted radio communications networks, such as the nationwide system developed by narco cartels in Mexico. Watch Marc Goodman's TED Talk . Technology has made our world increasingly open, and for the most part that has huge benefits for society. Nevertheless, all of this openness may have unintended consequences. Take, for example, the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai, India. The perpetrators were armed with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. The lethal innovation was the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies, including smartphones, satellite imagery and night-vision goggles to locate additional victims and slaughter them. Moreover, the terrorists created their own operations center across the border in Pakistan, where they monitored global news broadcasts, online reporting and social media in real time, leveraging the public's photos, videos and social network updates to kill more people. TED.com: All your devices can be hacked . The terrorists in the Mumbai incident even used search engines during their attack to identify individual hostages and to determine, based upon their backgrounds, who should live or and who should die.  These innovations gave terrorists unprecedented situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and the government. Newer forms of technology are also subject to criminal misuse.  Robots are becoming more commonplace, and international organized crime groups and terrorists have lost no time in deploying these technologies as part of their field operations. For example, drug traffickers in Latin America are using robotic submarines to deliver thousands of tons of cocaine annually to the United States. Last year, the FBI arrested a man in Boston who planned to use remote-controlled robotic aircraft packed with explosives to attack both the U.S. Pentagon and Capitol building.  In the future, as robots become more widely deployed, so too could their criminal use and exploitation. TED.com: How cyberattacks threaten real-world peace . Advances in the life sciences means it is now possible to design DNA on a computer screen and send the DNA code to a ""bio printer"" for assembly. Our ability to reprogram DNA itself will undoubtedly lead to great advances in medicine, but the danger is that these same techniques can be used to modify viruses, like H5N1 influenza, to become more and more lethal, potentially affecting millions around the globe. To hackers, DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked. We are at the dawn of an exponentially advancing technological arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill. Though such battles have gone on since the beginning of time, what has changed is the pace of innovation. New technologies and capabilities are emerging so quickly, it becomes increasingly likely they will outpace the capabilities of public safety officials to respond.  The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. TED.com: A 21st century cyber-weapon . Technology is proliferating at an exponential pace and despite law enforcement's best efforts, cybercrime grows unabated. In coming years, we will witness an explosion in the use of robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and synthetic biology. There is little to suggest police will be any more prepared for these emerging threats than they were for basic cyber crimes. Our current nation-based legal and policing paradigms have clearly not kept pace with the global threat. The paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism call for a shift to a more open and participatory form of law enforcement. Given the rapid acceleration of technological development, any system that relies on a small, elite force of highly trained government agents may be doomed to failure. Good people in the world far outnumber those with ill intentions. But criminals and terrorists have shown their ability to take up technological arms to harm the general populace. This calls for increased vigilance on the part of ordinary citizens. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us.

"STRASBOURG, France (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday called on Europe and the United States to drop negative attitudes toward each other and said ""unprecedented coordination"" is needed to confront the global economic crisis. President Obama delivers remarks at a town hall meeting Friday in Strasbourg, France. Speaking at a packed town hall meeting in Strasbourg on his first overseas trip as president, Obama said, ""I'm confident that we can meet any challenge as long as we are together."" It's easier to allow ""resentments to fester"" than ""to forge true partnerships,"" the president said. ""So we must be honest with ourselves. In recent years, we've allowed our alliance to drift. I know that there have been honest disagreements over policy. But we also know that there's something more that has crept into our relationship. ""In America, there's a failure to appreciate Europe's leading role in the world. Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where America's showed arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive. ""But in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious.

"(CNN)Whenever someone starts talking about the ""good ol' days"" of air travel, remind them about eating at old school airports. Back then, a meal at the airport meant horsing down a candy bar from the gift shop and wrestling with a vending machine for a can of soda. Nowadays, large, medium and even some smaller airports provide legitimately good restaurants, with enough interesting offerings and atmosphere to make that three-hour layover just a little less hellish. There's still room for culinary upgrades -- as noted below, some airports haven't yet figured out that sitting on planes makes us hungry and irritable -- but the best places to eat in the country's busiest airports (ranked by passenger traffic, per FAA statistics) generally range from good to great. 20. Honolulu International (HNL) What Hawaii offers in fun and sun, its marquee airport lacks in decent food options. Your best bet: Eat before you hit the road. If you must eat at HNL, opt for a sit-down meal at Stinger Ray's; it's the only place with a restaurant-like feel to it. Hard to go wrong with the nachos or pulled pork sandwich. 5 healthy eating tips for travelers . 19. Seattle-Tacoma International (SEA) Anthony's Restaurant started as a single seafood joint in 1969. Now the company consists of 22 locations and a private fleet of fishermen. Each location -- yes, even the one in the Central Terminal -- serves seasonal Pacific seafood and shellfish from the Northwest, Alaska and Hawaii. The mountain blackberry cobbler is an addictive Cinnabon alternative. 18. Fort Lauderdale International (FLL) The Food Network finally cooked up the most obvious way to cash in on its success: It opened a restaurant. Fans can stop by Food Network Kitchen in Terminal 3 and choose Florida-inspired dishes from the grab-and-go menu (Caesar salad with key lime dressing) or the made-to-order menu (including a club sandwich with, you guessed it, key lime mayo). Of course, the TVs play the likes of Guy Fieri and Bobby Flay all day long. 7 of the world's artsiest hotels . 17. Orlando International (MCO) Orlando airport seems to be unaware of the current revival in airport restaurants. Nonchain options are limited. You can try your luck with a latte at ZaZa's Cuban Coffee or the sliders at Johnny Rivers' Grill and Market. But you might be just as happy going with what you know at Qdoba, Burger King or Outback. 16. Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County (DTW) The venerable kid staple gets a makeover at PB&J near Gate A1. The menu offers preset gourmet peanut butter and jelly combos, as well as an option to customize your own. ""The Exceptional is the most popular sandwich,"" says Fares Saah, one of the airport's food court managers. It comes loaded with peanut butter, honey and bacon on cinnamon swirl bread. ""People are always surprised by the combination, but there have been no complaints."" 15. Minneapolis-St. Paul International (MSP) At upscale noodle and sushi shop Shoyu, you use an anchored-down iPad to order your meal. Once you've picked your food, you can continue to play with the iPad or you can watch the chefs make Japanese noodles in the open kitchen. Pork belly pot stickers, Thai lettuce wraps, sushi and noodle bowls are all on the menu. 14. Newark Liberty International (EWR) You're in New Jersey, but you can eat like you're in New York. OK, the Grand Central Oyster Bar in Terminal C may lack the atmosphere of its New York City sister, but, hey, you're in an airport. The food, especially the crab cakes and fried calamari, is still equally good. 13. San Francisco International (SFO) There's real, upscale comfort food at Cat Cora's Kitchen near Gate 55. The Iron Chef uses organic and fresh ingredients with a health-conscious mindset. Highlights include the steak tacos, lobster mac and cheese or baked jalapeño poppers stuffed with creamy feta cheese and breaded with panko crumbs. The cocktails are stiff and refreshing, too, like the cucumber martini or the Love and Haight (chili-infused tequila with blood orange juice, lime juice and honey). 12. Miami International (MIA) You may recognize chef Lorena Garcia from her Taco Bell commercials, but fast food burritos notwithstanding, she really has made some good career moves. Her airport outpost, Lorena Garcia Cocina (Concourse D), serves Caribbean jerk chicken, shrimp ceviche and baked breakfast empanadas that come out of the kitchen fast, but not suspiciously fast. The restaurant also includes a Bacardi Mojito Bar, where you can order (very) tall drinks before facing the departure lounge. 11. John F Kennedy International, New York City (JFK) Chef Andrew Carmellini's New York restaurants -- The Dutch and Locanda Verde -- are always packed. Can't be bothered? Stop by Croque Madame in Terminal 2 and grab his food to go. On offer: French-inspired open-faced sandwiches, crepes and made-to-order salads. 10. Phoenix Sky Harbor International (PHX) Ask any Phoenician where to find the best tamale and they'll point you to El Bravo in Sunnyslope. No time to get there during your trip? Check in at the airport early and snag one there. The family team makes its famous green chile tamales at its original outpost every morning and drops them off, so you're getting quality. ""People will try one for lunch and like them so much they'll buy a dozen frozen ones to take home,"" says Monique Othon, whose grandmother created the original recipe. 9. Philadelphia International (PHL) In town, Chickie's & Pete's is a go-to spot for watching sports and it's no different in PHL. It's not just for Eagles fans, either. With four airport locations, its TVs offer a multitude of sports and teams. ""It's not uncommon for us to have international soccer league games on for our foreign travelers,"" says co-owner Pete Ciarrocchi. If you don't care about the games, there's always the crabfries: crinkle-cut fries dusted with salt and spicy crab seasoning, served with a side of cheese sauce. 8. George Bush Intercontinental, Houston (IAH) Urban Crave has the look and feel -- and trendy menu -- of a real restaurant, it's just smaller, and in an airport. At Gate C33, one of the restaurant's most popular orders is the 10-inch all-beef ""haute dog."" We like the Sonoran Dog, which comes wrapped in bacon and topped with mayo, mustard, ketchup, tomatoes, onions, jalapeños and salsa verde. The 10-ounce inside-out burger has bacon and cheddar on the inside of the patty. 7. McCarran International, Las Vegas (LAS) The recently opened Terminal 3 features 14 new gates and seven new restaurants. The best one: The Village Pub, which has locations all over Las Vegas. The family-owned restaurant offers beer-battered fish and chips, fried chicken and handcrafted beers from Vegas. There's even a convenient beer window so you can grab a pint and play the slots right until fly time. 6. Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) The meaty aromas emanating from Brookwood Farms BBQ waft all the way to the security lines, where they taunt hungry travelers. The restaurant has an onsite smoker and whatever doesn't get cooked there gets smoked at Brookwood's 80,000-square-foot facility nearby. ""We have 200 yards of barbecue pits with a capacity to smoke 100,000 pounds of meat per night,"" says Craig Wood, a vice president at the company. Not surprisingly, the pulled pork -- which is blended with tangy Carolina vinegar barbecue sauce -- is the best-seller. 5. Los Angeles International (LAX) Late last year, LAX finally announced plans to add 15 eateries to Tom Bradley International Terminal. Between now and 2014, hot spots, including Umami Burger, 800 Degrees and Michael Voltaggio's sandwich shop ink.sack, will open. Until then, your best bet is Pinks, which specializes in hot dogs but also has a pastrami burrito and cheese fries on the menu. 4. Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW) If you've got a morning flight, Cereality at gate C6 is like Chipotle, but with cereal instead of burritos. The more obvious Texas choice is barbecue. Family-owned Cousin's Bar-B-Q (at Terminals B and C) also offers locations outside the airport and has 30 years of experience cooking ribs and sausages. 3. Denver International (DEN) If you're a Denver transit traveler who likes to knock back a few before hitting the  skies, there's the New Belgium Hub (Gates B80). The food here is fine, but it's the beer selection -- from the eponymous local craft brewery -- that keeps tables full. Fat Tire Amber Ale and Ranger IPA are popular. Of course, so is Coors Light. 2. Chicago O'Hare International (ORD) Chef Rick Bayless is known for his Mexican food and has several restaurants in Chicago. The only problem? Most of them are closed on Sundays and Mondays. But his Tortas Frontera restaurants (in Terminals 1 and 3) are open every day, giving travelers a chance to try his tortas, molletes and fresh-made guacamole. Bayless stands by his food so confidently that he lists food suppliers on his website, accounting for everything from antibiotic-free chicken to the sour cream. 1. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) Passing through the busiest airport in the country? You could support a local franchise and get a chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-A. But One Flew South in Terminal E is the airport's first upscale restaurant. On the menu: pecan-dusted scallops, pork belly sliders and a house-cured salmon bruschetta. Once you're nice and stuffed, you can fall into a food coma in a private 7-by-8 foot room at Minute Suites ($32 for the first hour), located at Concourse B, Gate B15.

"(CNN) -- The flu is hitting younger people harder this season than in years past, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. People between the ages of 18 and 64 represent 61% of all influenza-related hospitalizations recorded during the current flu season -- a significant increase compared with previous years when this age group represented about 35% of cases. More flu deaths than usual have also occurred in people under 65. Adults between 25 and 64 account for more than half of flu deaths this season, according to the CDC, compared with less than a quarter last year. ""Influenza can make anyone very sick, very fast and it can kill,"" said the CDC's director, Dr. Tom Frieden. ""Vaccination every season is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself."" CDC experts estimate only a third of people 18 to 64 had been vaccinated by November. About 40% to 45% of Americans get vaccinated each year, Frieden said. Health officials continue to encourage vaccinations for everyone who is at least 6 months old. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted this year's flu vaccine reduces the chance of having to go to the doctor for treatment by about 60% across all age groups. In past years, the vaccine's effectiveness has ranged from 30% to 65%. The CDC has known for weeks that the dominant flu strain this season is the H1N1 virus, which first emerged in April 2009 and caused a pandemic. It's included in all flu shots and nasal vaccines this year, according to the MMWR. ""We are committed to the development of better flu vaccines, but existing flu vaccines are the best preventive tool available now,"" Frieden said. Pregnant women are at particularly high risk of developing serious complications from the flu, such as pneumonia. Leslie Creekmore of Arkansas was 20 weeks' pregnant when she contracted the flu this month. Five days after checking into a hospital, she miscarried. Three weeks later, Creekmore died. She did not get the flu vaccine. Fifty pediatric flu-related deaths have been reported during the current flu season, according to the MMWR. Adult flu deaths are not reported on a national basis, but the CDC estimates that between 3,000 and 49,000 people die each year because of the flu and flu-related illness. When H1N1 first surfaced, California health officials decided to make reporting fatal influenza cases in all individuals under 65 mandatory. As of February 14, local health officials had reported 243 deaths. ""The 405 reports of severe cases (i.e., fatal and ICU cases combined) were more than in any season since the 2009 pandemic,"" officials wrote in the MMWR. Influenza activity in the United States remained elevated through February 8, according to the CDC. Twenty-four states reported widespread flu activity that week. ""Widespread"" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. The designation addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. Experts expect elevated flu activity in parts of the United States for several more weeks, especially in states where flu activity started later. ""I want to remind you that the season is not over,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. ""There is still a lot of influenza circulating. If you haven't been vaccinated yet, it's not too late for you to benefit."" In addition to getting the vaccine, washing your hands frequently and staying home when you're sick can help you and others get through the flu season. Doctors recommend using antivirals within the first two days of experiencing any flu-like symptoms. CNN's Jacque Wilson, Miriam Falco and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","People between 18 and 64 represent 61% of all flu-related hospitalizations, CDC says .

"Chelsey Carlson called the police after she said her husband, Staff Sargent Robert Carlson, punched her in the face and fired gun shots at her from the upstairs window of their house. He's now in jail -- serving eight years in prison for assault with a deadly weapon. Before this incident in 2012, Carlson served 28 months in Iraq and a year in Afghanistan. Carlson is not alone: As many as nine percent of recent retuning veterans have been arrested, according to a study by the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. CNN's Jake Tapper was granted exclusive access to the Haynesville Correctional Center in Virginia, which houses a program geared specifically toward veteran support services. Many veterans say they didn't know about the resources provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to help make their transition back into civilian life easier. The program ay Haynesville is one of the first of its kind -- and some veterans say it is providing them the guidance they didn't receive during their time in the military. ""I got out blind, not knowing all that was out there, not knowing that the V.A. could assist with housing or medical or dental or anything like that,"" Jimmy Jackson, who was honorably discharged from the marines, said. ""I didn't know any of that. I just got out and figured that was the end of my service."" Jackson spent time in the facility because he forged checks after his military service concluded. ""I was struggling really bad,"" he said. ""I needed the money right then and there.""

Drug and alcohol violations are chief among the common crimes for which the 75 veterans serve time in dormitory 5-A OF the correctional center. Archie Tyler, who served in the army in Afghanistan for five years, told CNN's Tapper he took drugs to deal with ""some of the sights and stuff I seen over there."" ""By us being here I actually kind of got back some of those military values,"" he said. ""Now I'm actually on the right track."" Rasheedah Martin, a counselor at the facility, says the biggest challenge facing the group is post-traumatic stress disorder. Part of her job, she says, is reaching out to the community to let veterans know that their facility can help. Veterans say these support services and peer workshops set their facility apart from the rest of the prison community. Some even called the facility a ""brotherhood."" ""I got a college degree since I've been here and did really well,"" Desert Storm veteran Donald Young said. ""Guys tended to be supportive of that whereas before they were anywhere from indifferent to mocked it and would get in the way of it."" The program is still too new to fully assess its success, but early numbers suggest that the rate of offenders who return to prison after spending time in the facility is lower than average. But when it comes to fighting stigma about seeking mental health in the veteran community, there's still a long way to go. ""Don't be too proud to help. Help is out there,"" Young said.

"Leaders in Utah say they found a way to get around the government shutdown. Utah will reopen its five national parks by Saturday, as well as three other nationally run locations. Utah's Governor Gary Herbert made the announcement Thursday, saying a deal had been reached with the U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. ""Utah agrees to pay the National Park Service (NPS) up to $1.67 million— $166,572 per day—to re-open eight national sites in Utah for up to 10 days. If the federal government shutdown ends before then, the State will receive a refund of unused monies"" an official press statement explained. The deal would reopen Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion national parks. The other three locations that will be opened are Natural Bridges and Cedar Breaks national monuments, as well as Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. ""Utah's national parks are the backbone of many rural economies and hard-working Utahns are paying a heavy price for this shutdown,"" Herbert said in the released statement.  ""I commend Secretary Jewell for being open to Utah's solution, and the world should know Utah is open for business and visitors are welcome."" October is an especially profitable month for Utah's national parks, since optimal weather attracts a high volume of tourists. Typically, officials estimate a $100 million yield for the month, so the parks' closures would have had an especially high impact on the state. The Department of the Interior is now awaiting a transfer of funds from Utah, at which point it will notify ""site-specific"" personnel to return to work. The process of opening the parks after receiving the money should take some time, but in a statement from the governor's office, the state anticipates all sites should be ""fully operational by Saturday"". In the event that the federal government shutdown drags on longer than the 10 days that have been accounted for, the state of Utah insists it would be able to make additional payments to keep the parks operational. The agreement between Herbert and Jewell stipulates that the money spent by the state can be reimbursed with Congressional approval. However, as with other funds spent during the shutdown, Congress is under no obligation to refund the bill. It seems Herbert is quite intent on pursuing repayment, with his office telling reporters ""the Governor has engaged Utah's congressional delegation to actively pursue timely repayment to state coffers.""","Officials will open eight locations by Saturday .

"It's been less than two months since the world first learned about it, and now, it's official. Call her Thor. Wednesday sees the publication of ""Thor"" #1, which tells how the original Thor we all know (perhaps best of all, Chris Hemsworth's character in the movie) is replaced by a new Thor with two X chromosomes. CNN spoke with writer Jason Aaron, who talks about how having a woman carry the hammer of Thor was the plan all along. CNN: Why did you decide to try this story arc? Aaron: I've been working for a couple of years now -- 25 issues at this point -- I've always known I was working towards making him unworthy. Worthiness was a big theme in those first 25 issues. The idea that he'd wake up every morning and look at that hammer, and not know if he could pick it up, then that means one day, he wouldn't pick it up. So perhaps someone else could pick it up -- the only one I ever considered for that role is the one we have, the woman behind that mask. In issue 2, we get to see her in action for the first time, and how similar or different she is to the first guy to wield the hammer. CNN: Is this change long term? Aaron: Yes. It's not four or five issues and we're done. A lot of people have speculated that with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" next year, which has Thor in a prominent role, they guessed that we would change the character back in time for the movie, that's not the plan. I wanted to make sure that we were committed to this being a long-term story. You won't see everything put back the way it was anytime soon. She is the Thor of the Marvel Universe for the foreseeable future. We have these Marvel creative summits a few times a year, and a bunch of writers get together and talk about what our stories will be months and  years down the line. At this last one, we talked about stories to the end of 2015 and beyond. When we would talk about Thor, we would be talking  about her. She's gonna be on adventures all throughout the Marvel universe. CNN: Did you expect this much attention? Aaron: I never really think or worry about that kind of stuff. I've never had something announced on ""The View"" before. That helps it go more mainstream than a lot of the stuff I've done. I never worry about that when I'm sitting down to write the story. I just work the best I can to tell the story I want to tell. CNN: How much do you pay attention to fan feedback? Aaron: I take it all with a grain of salt, whether it's high praise or people who are just venting rage. I never let any of that kind of stuff change the story I want to tell. It's been exciting to see people anxious to pick up the book. That's been great, but on the flip side it's been disappointing to see people respond negatively to the fact that it's a female picking up the hammer now. That part's been disappointing, but that to me has been washed out by the people who are excited to see a new Thor story. CNN: What did you decide to go for with the design of the new Thor? Aaron: We wanted her to look like Thor, the Viking god of thunder, someone who carried a hammer around for a living. Russell Dauterman is the artist on the new book, and he's the one who has been drawing that new costume for the most part. I think it looks amazing in his hands. CNN: Finally, one of the biggest questions we've heard is: Why is she called Thor? Aaron: It's not a situation where she picks up the hammer and says ""Hey, I'm Thor now, everybody call me Thor."" That's very much a story point that we address a couple of issues down the line. The previous guy is still around, he's Thor Odinson. You can imagine when the two of them meet, face to face, there will be a lot of questions. He wants to know who this lady is running around with his hammer now. That will all be answered in the pages of the book. Sony planning movie with female superhero .","The character of Thor is taken up by a woman in the just-released ""Thor"" #1 .

"Seriously endowed, dirndl-straining blonde waitresses at risk of a major wardrobe malfunction ferry armloads of steins from table to table in a sloshy blur. Manly, thigh-slapping hunks in clingy lederhosen, pound down torrents of weizen beer. Teutonic endorphins are on parade. This could only be summer in Bavaria. Look at any beer ad or wander into any beer garden and you'll realize that Bavarians absolutely revel in the traditional cliches about beer and go to great lengths to live up to them. Then there's Sister Doris. A quiet sensation hidden behind monastery walls, she's been turning water into beer at Mallersdorf, a 12th-century abbey in the Bavarian highlands, for more than 40 years. She's a certified master brewer. She's also a Franciscan nun. The local beer culture notwithstanding, Sister Doris is living proof that women are destined for a higher calling than simply serving beer and starring in Germany's retrograde beer ads. Germany's beer scene is seriously dude-centric. And Bavaria's is even more so. The regional trade association doesn't have a single woman in its ranks. 10 of Asia's best beer bars . 'Ladies who lager' Only a small handful of women brew beer in Bavaria. And the notion that ""women don't like beer"" still holds sway. Which is why Sister Doris is so important. She's one of a tiny group of ""ladies who lager"" -- female brewmasters who are charting their own course and debunking stereotypes about women and beer. Like many monasteries back in the day, Mallersdorf Abbey became a magnet for pilgrims seeking blessings from saints' relics on display in the abbey church. With droves of visitors in need of sustenance and an iffy water supply from pathogen-laden streams and wells, beer was one of the few drinks that was safe in the Middle Ages. This is why beer-making gradually became an important sideline at monasteries throughout Europe. It flourished at Mallersdorf, as well, but was sidelined by the growth of secular breweries and not revived until 1881, when the current brew house was built. What sets Mallersdorf apart from the handful of other surviving abbey breweries is that Sister Doris is the only remaining nun brewmaster -- in all of Europe. On brewing day, she's excused from morning prayers and makes her way to the abbey brew house by 3:30 a.m. Depending on the season, she can be found crafting a copper-toned vollbier (lager), a dark zoigl, a contemplative doppelbock or spritzy maibock. It's the stuff of gods. She gives a thumbs down to Bavaria's favorite weizen beer and doesn't bother to brew it. In Bavaria, this borders on apostasy. Sister Doris doesn't care -- she's a woman of decided tastes and firm opinions. 'Women's work' Catholic nuns, by tradition, are destined for a life of prayer and service from the moment they enter the convent. In what must be the most unusual career move ever made by a nun, when Sister Doris took the veil she became a brewmaster instead, succeeding the elderly Franciscan sister who had been operating the abbey brewery since the 1930s. ""She looked me up and down like a farmer eyes an ox,"" Sister Doris tells a visitor about her selection process. Sister Doris got the job. Fresh out of training, master brewer's certificate in hand, she took over the brewery in 1975. ""Beer brewing is women's work,"" she says, adding that female brewers were common in the Middle Ages. She's proud that northern Bavaria has the largest number of female brewers in Germany. Among them are Sigi and Barbara Friedmann and the Meinel sisters, who are rocking the Bavarian beer scene with a new line of craft brews. As any lover of artisanal beer will point out, there's an inverse relationship between size and quality. Stated simply: the bigger the brewery, the less interesting the beer. Or to put it the other way around: the smaller the brewery and the closer the brewer is to the brewing process, the more flavorful the beer is likely to be. Sister Doris proves this maxim. Mallersdorf operates in splendid isolation, far from brewing hubs like Munich, Bamberg, Hamburg and Berlin. Measured by volume, scale, efficiency, size of ad budget (zero) or any other metric, the abbey brewery is 100% old school. Just how far under the radar it operates becomes clear when you realize that Sister Doris brews only 3,000 hectoliters (just under 80,000 gallons) a year. To say that this is infinitesimal by industry standards is an understatement. Global giants Coors and Anheuser-Busch/InBev turn out the same amount of beer every eight minutes. There's a catch though. Not only is Sister Doris's beer -- luscious as it is -- not exported. It's available only in the nooks and crannies of eastern Bavaria. Brand Doris . With an iconic brewmaster like Sister Doris and exceptional beers that are loaded with character, Mallersdorf could grow. The Franciscans, however, are apparently not inclined to expand or leverage the beer's local following into something bigger. It seems they have no ambitions beyond selling their beer ""um den Kirchturm"" -- around the proverbial church tower. This means beer lovers in the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and other countries experiencing the craft beer revolution won't be tasting Sister Doris's beer locally anytime soon. Drinkers need to travel to Germany, but even then, they may not have an easy go of it. The tourist infrastructure in the immediate area isn't well developed. The brewery doesn't have a website or its own telephone number. And, while pilgrimages to the abbey and Marian shrine in the nearby village of Haindling are encouraged, tours of the brewery aren't offered. Those who do make it to eastern Bavaria and Mallersdorf Abbey can sample Sister Doris's brews at the abbey tap (klosterbraustuberl), run by Renate und Heinz Bauer (Nardinistrasse 1, Mallersdorf-Pfaffenberg; +49 772 915470). The concept of ""marketing"" would likely fall under its own weight if anybody ever tried to interest the Franciscan sisters of Mallersdorf in it. Sister Doris carries the brewery on the strength of her reputation, the fiercely loyal following she enjoys and the breakout quality of the beer she brews. Mallersdorf Abbey has a ""brand"" and her name is Sister Doris.","Franciscan nun Sister Doris is one of only a handful of women working in Bavaria's beer industry .

"The father of NSA leaker Edward Snowden told reporters in Moscow that he thinks his son deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. He arrived there Thursday for his first visit with his son since the former government IT contractor fled the United States after leaking National Security Agency spy program details to the media. Members of the European Parliament nominated Snowden  in September  for the Andrei Sakharov Prize, which honors figures who stand up to oppressive powers.  The prize was awarded to Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai on Thursday. ""Edward took the Sakharov prize nomination very calmly,"" Lon Snowden told reporters at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport. ""He wanted to expose the injustices in the American system, and wasn't doing it with any awards in mind."" Edward Snowden collected information on spy programs, in which the NSA mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States. He exposed the program to the media. Anticipating legal consequences, he initially fled to Hong Kong in late May but flew to Moscow on June 23. He was holed up at the airport for more than five weeks. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. Snowden received asylum in Russia on August 1 and left the airport. Snowden's father: 'I know my son. I know he loves his country' Low profile . Lon Snowden's visit to Russia seems shrouded in mystery, as Edward Snowden is keeping information about himself close to the vest. ""I've had no direct contact with my son despite previous reports, so I really have no idea what his intentions are,"" Lon Snowden told reporters at the airport. Snowden the son has kept a low profile, apparently not even telling his father where in Russia he is living. ""I cannot answer the question if Edward is in Moscow,"" Lon Snowden said. ""I don't know that. I haven't been informed where Edward is right now."" His lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, also has not disclosed Snowden's location. But he told reporters that he had met with him Wednesday. It appears that Snowden is settling in to his new surroundings. He has been living from savings and donations but has had some job offers, Kucherena said. ""I am confident that he would find a high-paying job. He is very capable.""  He is also learning Russian and soaking in Russian culture, Kucherena said. And he has a girlfriend. The lawyer earlier told reporters that Edward Snowden may hold a news conference soon, but later reversed that, saying the former contractor had no intention of speaking publicly. Since the movie ""The Fifth Estate"" came out, which is based on the experiences of WikiLeaker Julian Assange, producers have contacted Snowden about telling his story on film. But he does not seem interested at the time. Defending his son . As in the past, Lon Snowden defended his son's actions Thursday, calling him a ""whistle-blower"" who is ""not leaking information."" ""I don't think the American public knows all the details of what my son did,"" he said. Snowden has said that he does not expect his son to receive a fair trial in the United States and would not want him to come home, until that changes. ""I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the U.S. again. That's his decision. He is an adult,"" the elder Snowden told reporters. He thanked the Russian people and President Vladimir Putin for taking his son in. ""I consider Edward to be absolutely safe in Russia. He is comfortable here,"" he said. Lon Snowden has received a visa for multiple entries into the country.  ""I hope to return to Russia many times,"" he said. Father Lon carefully separated his own interests from Edward Snowden's, speaking of getting on with his own life in the United States, while his son moves on with his in Russia. But he in no way distanced himself from the younger Snowden. He told reporters: ""I am his father. I love my son.""

"Sevastopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russian troops reportedly smash open the gates of a Ukrainian base. Russia's navy traps Ukrainian ships. Armed men refuse to allow military observers to enter Ukraine's Crimea region. The crisis in Ukraine took on a decidedly military flavor Friday as tensions flared between Moscow and Kiev over control of Crimea, even as the world's diplomats said conflict could be avoided. Crimea, a self-governing peninsula in southern Ukraine with an ethnic Russian majority and strong cultural ties to Russia, has become the epicenter of a battle for influence between Moscow, Kiev and the West since Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was pushed out of office by protesters who were angered over his rebuff of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of one with Russia. In the days since Yanukovych was ousted, thousands of Russian troops have surrounded military bases and key infrastructure sites, and they have taken control of border crossings. At the same time, a political battle has been playing out between the two countries, with Russia's Parliament on Friday giving its defiant support to Crimean lawmakers who want to see their region split from Ukraine and join Russia. Complete coverage on the Ukraine crisis . Political moves . The lawmakers' unanimous call for a vote on separation prompted howls of outrage Thursday in the United States and Europe and the threat of sanctions, including asset freezes, visa bans and travel bans. The delegation from the Crimean Parliament, which said it would put the decision to a public vote on March 16, headed to Moscow on Friday and got a very different reaction. Valentina Matvienko, speaker of Russia's upper house of Parliament, told the Crimean delegation it would ""support and welcome"" any decision made by the Crimean people to become a part of Russia. Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk condemned talk of a split. ""I want to warn separatists and other traitors of the Ukrainian state who are trying to work against Ukraine, any of your decisions taken is unlawful, unconstitutional, and nobody in the civilized world is going to recognize the results of the so-called referendum of the so-called Crimean authorities,"" he said Friday. Russia has denounced Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities. Putin has insisted he has the right to use military force in Ukraine if necessary to protect ethnic Russians in Crimea. But Ukrainian officials say no threat exists, and Putin is using it as a pretext to control the region. Map: How Ukraine is divided . U.S. President Barack Obama set out a potential solution to the crisis when he spoke to Putin on Thursday, the White House said. The proposal includes direct talks between Kiev and Moscow, the withdrawal of Russian forces, international support for elections on May 25, and the presence of international monitors to ""ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected, including ethnic Russians,"" Obama said. Crimean threat? What has mostly been a peaceful standoff in Crimea, with virtually no sign of Ukrainian military movement, appeared to take a turn on Friday when pro-Russian forces smashed open the gates of a Ukrainian base near Sevastopol that controls airspace in southern Ukraine, Vitaly Onishenko, a deputy commander at the base, told CNN. Ukraine's military spokesman initially said the forces were Cossacks, akin to Russian paramilitary troops, but Onishenko later dismissed that claim and said the forces were Russian and wore military uniforms with no insignia. Ukrainian troops refused to surrender and barricaded themselves inside a control room, Onishenko said. Outside the base, self-styled Crimean defense forces, similar to local militias, attacked journalists, he said. At least one person, believed to be a journalist, was injured and taken to a hospital, he said. The standoff at the base eventually ended with the Russian-speaking forces pulling back to the outside of the base, Onishenko said. Ukrainian authorities also reported that the Russian Black Sea Fleet sank a second of its own, old ships at the entrance to Lake Donuzlav, an inlet on the western coast of Crimea that is home to a Ukrainian naval base. Viktor Shmihanovsky, vice commander of the base, told CNN that several Ukrainian naval ships are now trapped inside. Unidentified armed troops also have blocked unarmed European military observers from entering the country for the second straight day. Masked men carrying rifles and wearing camouflage uniforms stopped the 43 observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a regional security organization, at a checkpoint separating the mainland from the Crimean peninsula, CNN's Matthew Chance said. One man, speaking in Russian, said: ""I've been ordered by the government of Crimea not to let anyone in."" Live: Ukraine crisis updates . And in signs that the pro-Russian Crimean authorities are clamping down on dissent within the peninsula, at least two Ukrainian channels, 1+1 and Channel 5, have been blocked from broadcasting. The head of 1+1 told CNN that Russian state TV outlet Channel One is now broadcasting on its frequency. A Bulgarian freelance journalist and his colleague also were assaulted while filming in Simferopol, the regional capital. The journalist told CNN he was wrestled to the ground, and a gun was put to his head. The incident was captured on surveillance footage and aired on a Ukrainian TV channel, Hromadske TV. The standoff has also prompted neighboring countries and their allies to boost military defenses, with the United States beefing up its number of fighter jets in Lithuania and Poland. The USS Truxton, a guided-missile destroyer, was also heading to the Black Sea to join in pre-planned military exercises with Romanian and Bulgarian forces. Asset freezes, visa bans . Meanwhile, as the West seeks to put the diplomatic squeeze on Russia, European Union nations said they'll suspend some talks with Russia and have threatened travel bans, asset freezes and the cancellation of a planned EU-Russia summit. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told French public radio Friday that tougher measures are planned if Moscow doesn't act to de-escalate the situation. ""And if another attempt is made, then we would enter into something completely different -- that is to say serious consequences for the relations between Europe and Russia,"" he said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned against sanctions, saying in a statement that they would ""inevitably boomerang"" on the United States. But there's help on hand for the fledgling government in Kiev. Ukraine's new government and the EU have agreed to revive a trade deal and an aid package that could bring $15 billion to Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund is also ready to help, the head of the agency's European section said. NATO is willing to help Ukraine's military ""modernize and strengthen,"" Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN's Becky Anderson on Friday. Such aid is desperately needed. The Russian gas company, Gazprom, has not received any payment from Ukraine in February, according to the company's CEO, the Russian state news agency Itar-Tass, reported Friday. CEO Alexey Miller said Gazprom cannot give Ukraine gas for free, Itar-Tass reported. In Crimea: 'We will protect our land from Western extremists' Paralympic protest . Ukraine's Paralympic team sent just one member to participate in the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games in the Russian city of Sochi, said Dmitry Bulatov, Ukrainian minister of sports and youth. The decision to boycott the ceremonies, with the exception of a single flag bearer, was made unanimously by the team, he said. ""This is how our team expresses protest against aggressors and occupants entering our land,"" Bulatov said. Official delegations from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Canada and Poland earlier announced plans not to attend the Games. Athletes from those countries will still compete. Muslim minority fears for safety . Russian speakers make up about 60% of Crimea's population of more than 2 million, but around a quarter are Ukrainian and 12% are Crimean Tatar, a predominately Muslim minority. Neither of the latter two groups would welcome a switch to Russian control. A CNN crew met with Crimean Tatars in the town of Bakhchisaray amid fears for their safety that have reminded some of past oppression under the Soviet Union. Many spent years in exile -- in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan or other Soviet republics -- after the Soviet Union deported them for supposedly collaborating with Adolf Hitler. ""It is not legal,"" one elderly man said. ""We are the original nation of Crimea. Our Khan state was here. Russia left us with no rights. ""We don't want to be with Russia, we want to be with Ukraine,"" he said. Ukraine PM: Crimea 'was, is and will be an integral part of Ukraine' CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Sevastopol, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Egypt's public prosecutor ordered the arrest Saturday of nine men on criminal charges of ""debauchery"" after a social media video purporting to show a gay wedding went viral. In a statement, the prosecutor's office accused the men of ""debauchery"" and ""undermining public morals"" and ordered a physical examination by a forensic doctor, a common practice in Egypt when arresting homosexuals. While homosexuality is not overtly outlawed in Egypt, gay people can face criminal charges under statutes that broadly claim to protect social ""morality."" The short video that went viral last week appears to have been filmed at a party on a Nile riverboat and appears to show two men in dark suits exchanging rings. The prosecution's statement described it as a ""satanic ceremony"" with images that were ""shameful, regrettable and anger God."" The statement claims the event took place in April, but was only recently posted as an act of revenge against one of the men filmed in the video.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Audio released Friday purportedly captures an argument between Mel Gibson and ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, in which he launches into a racist, sexist rant against her. RadarOnline released the audio, claiming the male voice is that of 54-year-old Gibson. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the tape and the voices on it. At one point on the roughly two minute tape, the man says: ""You go out in public and it's a f***ing embarrassment to me. You look like a f***ing b**** on heat and if you get raped by a pack of n***ers it will be your fault."" It's unclear when the audio was recorded. Meanwhile, the William Morris Endeavor Publicity firm confirmed Friday that Mel Gibson is no longer their client. Earlier this week, the Malibu Hills Police Department opened an investigation into the alleged domestic violence dispute between Gibson and Grigorieva, 40, CNN has confirmed. Gibson has been caught in a custody dispute with Grigorieva over the couple's 8-month-old daughter. Toward the end of June, Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that the actor and director struck her in the face, People magazine reported. Police said they are still in the process of gathering information surrounding Grigorieva's allegations. CNN reached out to both Gibson and Grigorieva's representatives for response and to verify the authenticity of the audio. Mel Gibson's longtime publicist, Alan Nierob, on Friday evening said, ""We can't comment due to legal nature of the matter."" A spokesman for Grigorieva confirmed that the female voice heard on the audio tape obtained and posted by RadarOnline is the voice of Grigorieva. Stephen Jaffe also told CNN that the transcript as published on RadarOnline is an accurate transcript of a conversation she was engaged in with Gibson. Jaffe said the site did not receive the tapes from Grigorieva. She ""absolutely did not provide any tape to the media,"" Jaffe said. Grigorieva has spoken with sheriff's deputies and has provided a statement to them in their domestic violence investigation, Jaffe said. The publicist said Grigorieva did not initiate the investigation. Gibson came under fire for a racially charged tirade in 2006, when he admitted to making anti-Semitic remarks during a drunken driving arrest. He issued an apology at the time, and appealed to the Jewish community to help him recover from his alcohol addiction.","NEW: Grigorieva's camp confirms her voice is on tape .

"When it came to relegation from the English Premier League Fulham could not quite ""Beat It"" -- but things could have been very different if the London club had kept its lucky statue of Michael Jackson. Fulham's former owner Mohamed Al Fayed has blamed the club's demise on the removal of the statue he erected in memory of the late King of Pop outside the club's Craven Cottage stadium in 2011. After buying the club from Al Fayed in July 2013, American billionaire Shahid Khan had the two-and-a-half meter tribute dismantled. Jackson's statue now has a new home at the National Football Museum in Manchester, but Al Fayed says it is too late to save Fulham's fate. ""This statue was a charm and we removed the luck from the club and now we have to pay the price,""  Al Fayed told reporters as the statue was unveiled at the museum. ""When (Khan) asked me to move it I said, 'you must be crazy'. This is such a fantastic statue which the fans are crying out for. ""But now he has paid the price because the club has been relegated. He called me because he told me he wanted Michael to return. I told him, no way."" Al Fayed was a friend of the Jackson and the late singing superstar accepted an invitation to watch Fulham take on Wigan at Craven Cottage in English football's third tier in 1999. Following Jackson's death in 2009, the businessman split opinion among the club's fans with his decision to install the statue, with Al Fayed saying that fans who did not like his tribute could ""go to hell."" Jackson's statue now has a place in the English National Football Museum as part of the sport's folklore. ""This is a great place visited by thousands of people and I am very proud to present them with one of the greatest artists and singers in the world,"" said the 85-year-old Al Fayed. ""Michael is a fantastic example for everyone. He came from nowhere and showed fantastic determination to be a superstar and I am very glad that he is now in this great institution for people to enjoy."" Al Fayed ended 16 years at the helm of the London club last summer when he sold the club to Khan, owner of American football team the Jacksonville Jaguars. After a period of stability under Al Fayed, the club's form plummeted and it dropped down to the Championship after 13 years in the top flight of English football.","Did removal of Michael Jackson statue end Fulham's 13-year Premier League stay?

"Harold White jumped into action when he heard a rumor that Justin Bieber might be eyeing a mansion in Atlanta and could become his neighbor in the affluent Buckhead neighborhood. The retiree and longtime resident is worried about unwanted attention should the singer indeed move to Buckhead, known for its vast old-money mansions. White has organized a protest for 6 a.m. Monday in front of an on-the-market mansion that is part of the Bieber speculation. No one in Bieber's camp has commented on the rumored move, which began with a TMZ report. Still, the very idea of Bieber deciding to make the Georgia capital another home has proved enough to get residents such as White up in arms.

"STRASBOURG, France (CNN) -- President Obama hailed the NATO summit in Europe on Saturday, calling the meeting ""very productive"" and praising the alliance's commitment to the fight in Afghanistan. President Obama, speaking Saturday at the end of the NATO summit, said it was successful. ""Today I'm confident that we took a substantial step forward to renewing our alliance to meet the challenges of our time,"" said Obama. Speaking to reporters as demonstrators protested against more involvement in Afghanistan, Obama said he was ""pleased NATO allies pledged their strong and unanimous support"" for America's new strategy in Afghanistan -- which calls for more troops, trainers and civilian workers. He said America's NATO allies and partners have agreed to supply more combat troops to help shore up security during Afghan elections later this year. More trainers have also been pledged for the police and army, and an expansion of a trust fund to help sustain Afghan security forces is in the works. Obama talked about achieving an increase in non-military assistance, such as doctors, engineers, educators and agricultural specialists. America's NATO allies are pledging 5,000 more troops: 3,000 for the upcoming Afghan election security, 1,400 to 2,000 troops embedded with Afghan soldiers, and 400 police trainers. This is apart from the 17,000 more combat troops and 4,000 trainers Obama recently committed.  Watch how Obama is engaging allies » . ""These commitments have troops, trainers and civilians represent a strong down payment on the future of our mission in Afghanistan and on the future of NATO."" Obama had been pushing for more NATO troops in Afghanistan, and he was asked whether he thought he got enough combat troops. ""This was not a pledging conference, and yet, we already received the kinds of commitments that historically you don't see at a conference like this,"" he said. ""This was at a summit that was designed to discuss strategy as opposed to attract pledges, and I think it's an indication of the fact that this alliance is committed to achieving the focused goals that we have set out in Afghanistan.""  Watch NATO official talk about Afghanistan security » . Along with the focus on the ground in Afghanistan, Obama said the United States and his allies want to help strengthen Pakistan's ability to fight al Qaeda and ""deliver goods and services and a better life for its people."" Obama thanked French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for hosting the conference.  Watch Chancellor Merkel's remarks on conference » . ""I should add that not only were they gracious hosts, but the commitment that they made with respect to Afghanistan, indicate the seriousness of purpose with which they are approaching the NATO challenge and our mission in Afghanistan in particular,"" Obama said. Also at the end of the summit, it was announced that Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen had been named the alliance's new secretary-general. The decision was unanimous. Earlier in the day, the NATO leaders held symbolic ceremonies to mark France's return as a full NATO member and to remember those who have died in NATO-led missions during the alliance's 60-year history. The leaders gathered on a footbridge over the Rhine River separating France and Germany. Merkel and the other leaders walked to the middle from the German side of the bridge. There they met French President Sarkozy and all shook hands, symbolizing France's  re-entry in NATO's military command more than four decades after it left. Eight jets from the Patrouille Acrobatique de France, an aerial display team, flew overhead trailing the NATO colors of blue and white. The group then walked onto the French side of the bridge for a solemn ceremony to honor the men and women in uniform who have died in NATO missions and operations over the years. Surrounded by the flags of all 28 NATO member states, a lone military bugler played a tune before the place fell silent in memory of the fallen. The NATO alliance has grown at the summit to include two new members, Albania and Croatia. Obama noted that both have contributed troops to the Afghan mission. Noting that Saturday marked NATO's 60th birthday, Obama said, ""It's a measure of our vitality that we are still welcoming new members."" Saturday morning's ceremony over the Rhine was briefly delayed because Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was deep in conversation on his mobile phone. The other NATO leaders eventually went on without him, and he was absent for both ceremonies. Berlusconi rejoined them in time for a group photo after the moment of silence. After the conclusion of the summit Saturday, Obama plans to head to Prague, in the Czech Republic, the current president of the European Union. In Prague, Obama plans to make a speech on proliferation and ridding the world of nuclear weapons. As many as 30,000 people were expected to turn out for the speech, the first major foreign policy address of Obama's presidency.","NEW: Obama says NATO meeting ""very productive""

"Organizers of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have been set a tight deadline by FIFA to explain how conditions are improving for migrant workers on the various building projects associated with the hosting of football's showpiece competition. The world governing body are demanding a ""detailed report"" by February 12 with ""information on specific steps"" being taken to improve the situation. FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke wrote to Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy Thursday to request the assurances. Concerns over the welfare of migrant workers in Qatar was highlighted by an Amnesty International report last year, which reported on widespread abuse. It prompted FIFA president Sepp Blatter to describe the conditions as ""unacceptable"" and he raised the issue with the Emir of Qatar on a visit to Doha last November. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger has been given the responsibility to monitor any progress and has held a series of meeting with human rights and labor organizations, including Amnesty and the International Labor Organization (ILO). ""We are currently in the middle of an intensive process, which is exclusively aimed at improving the situation of workers in Qatar,"" Zwanziger said in a statement released by FIFA. ""Ultimately, what we need are clear rules and steps that will build trust and ensure that the situation, which is unacceptable at the moment, improves in a sustainable manner."" The Qatar World Cup 2022 Committee was not immediately available for comment. Zwanziger is due before the European Parliament on February 13, the day after the deadline for Qatar to report, in a hearing over workers' rights in the Arab emirate. The executive committee will also receive an update at its March 20 and 21 meeting. ""FIFA firmly believes in the power of the World Cup in triggering positive social change in Qatar, including improving the labor rights and conditions of migrant workers,"" it added. Since Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup it has been dogged by various controversies, with FIFA still to decide on an actual date for the competition. Acute summer temperatures in Qatar have led to fears over safety for players and spectators and Valcke told a French radio station earlier this month that he favored a winter World Cup with a November start. FIFA's official position is that a final decision will be made in December 2014.","Qatar given deadline over conditions for migrant workers on 2022 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Interaction, not isolation: CNN talks to Alex Steffen about his vision for a world where the Internet binds our communities together and strengthens the bonds between us all. CNN: Alex, what effect do you think the Internet has had on communities? Alex Steffen believes the Internet will bind our communities more strongly together . Alex Steffen: When the Internet really first started to hit, people felt this would be the death blow: after suburbs and long commutes and television and the death of the family dinner, this would be the last straw that would totally break society. No one would ever have a relationship, a conversation or a functional family relationship ever again. But what we found was the opposite: the Internet is proving to be the antidote to all those sort of things. It's bringing people back together. It's actually taking time out of television, especially for younger kids. CNN: What elements have you noticed in particular? AS: The Internet has made some phenomenal breakthroughs that are still only poorly understood in terms of changing people's ideas of us and them. If mass media, social isolation in the suburbs, alienating workplaces and long car commutes create a bunker mentality, the Internet does the opposite. CNN: So what you're saying is, the Internet brings us together? AS: Yes. It makes people suddenly aware that there are people who are like us in lots of different ways; and maybe you have connections to people who you normally wouldn't consider your buddies. They could live in another country but share your love of a particular band; or live in your community and believe what you believe about a local issue. They could be someone you hit it off with online who maybe comes from a slightly different walk of life and you'd never bump into them in normal social circumstances. For most people, using the Internet broadens their sense of who ""we"" is and actually ends up leaving us in a place of greater compassion and understanding. It leaves us more connected to a larger group of people and more at one with a lot more people in our community. CNN: How has the way that people use the Internet changed? AS: People -- especially the geeks who created it -- have tended to look at the Internet as something that's hermetically sealed: there's the Internet and the rest of the world. But that's not how people want to use the Internet. They want to use it as a way of better navigating the real world. People use tools like their laptops and their mobile phones as an opportunity to connect with others -- to meet, go out, find a restaurant, order a book from the library, figure out what the weather's going to be like or participate in some local political issue. People are doing these things with increasing regularity. CNN: It doesn't sound like the Internet that a lot of people imagine. AS: It's something that the people who are most famous as Internet experts of the last generation didn't really anticipate: that most people don't want to stay in their little cubicles and play Internet games all night. Most people want to get dates, buy presents more easily or meet up with their friends and family -- ""Where can I go to get the business of life done more efficiently and be more like the person I want to be?"" CNN: When did people first use the Internet as a campaigning tool? AS: The most notable examples, although people didn't comment on them at the time, were the anti-war protests at the beginning of the second Iraq war. All over the world, enormous numbers of people got together to protest the idea of that war. That was done almost entirely with online advocacy. Most of the people putting together those protests were tiny little groups that really didn't have the budget to do it in the normal way -- sending out lots of flyers, having people build phone trees. This time round, it was Web sites, e-mails and text messages, and lots of people talking. CNN: What sort of an impact do you think the Internet had on those protests? AS: I don't think those protests could have happened the way they happened before those tools were available. However, it's an intermediate step, not least because it showed that protests of that sort -- a bunch of people using new technologies to go hold signs together -- are not as effective as they need to be, because essentially the President of the United States of America could say, ""I don't care."" CNN: So what do you think the next step would be? AS: We're still figuring out what the next step is. I think we're going to start to see a new model of civic advocacy where people get together once in a while to protest, but it's more about an ongoing, sustained engagement in issues, networks and communities about which people care. We're already seeing the beginnings of it. There's this great phrase, ""continuous partial attention,"" to describe what people do online. They look at a little thing here, a little thing there, and they keep track of it all. It's the ultimate multi-tasking in our brains. We're going to see the Internet facilitate continuous partial attention more and more for local issues, for political issues, for community events, for things happening in your social network. We will find that's a great deal more attention than people previously paid with these things. While it's still in the early days, when it really comes to fruition it's really going to change everything. ................................................... What do you think of Alex Steffen's vision? Will technology help us build a brighter, fairer tomorrow? Tell us in the forum -- or read others' thoughts on the future.

"An apparent near miss between two aircraft that was captured on video at Barcelona Airport has prompted an investigation by Spanish aviation authorities. The video shows a Boeing 767 belonging to Russian airline UTair pulling up from its landing approach as an Aerolineas Argentinas Airbus A340 taxis across its path. No one was injured in the incident and the UTair plane was able to circle round and make a safe landing five minutes later. The video, shot on Saturday, had gained nearly two million YouTube hits by Monday. Spain's airport authority, AENA, said the government's Committee on Civil Aviation Incidents and Accidents would look into the incident. A Barcelona airport AENA spokeswoman told CNN that the UTair pilot had been cleared to land but exercised his authority to abort. She said the Aerolineas Argentinas flight also had permission to taxi across the runway. She did not comment on the timing of its maneuver. The spokeswoman said there had been no impact danger and the perspective of the video did not show that there was plenty of space between the two aircraft. It was ""not about a collision or a possible collision,"" she said, adding that neither airline had submitted a complaint over the incident. CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said that, according to plans of the airport, the two planes had been about half a mile apart at the time of the incident. ""That said, you see they had to perform a go-around and if you've ever been in an airliner that has to performed a go-around, it gets your attention,"" he said. O'Brien said air crews on the ground should check to see if the flightpath is clear before crossing a runway as part of standard protocols. ""What we can say here is the system did ultimately work -- the last resort that is, but there was a series of mistakes... that led to this."" Aerolineas Argentinas in Madrid referred calls to its headquarters in Buenos Aires, where CNN's efforts to reach anyone at the press office, through the switchboard and three direct lines, were unsuccessful after repeated attempts. In a statement, UTair said the pilot of its flight from Moscow to Barcelona had been following the instructions of Barcelona airport dispatchers. ""While lowering on a final approach track the commander found an obstacle on the runway (the aircraft of another airlines was crossing it),"" it said. ""The aircraft commander took prompt decision on the implementation of standard operating procedure -- go-around flight maneuver. ""The maneuver was carried out in the normal mode, the landing was successful, none of the passengers was injured. In this situation, the commander well judged and adequately assessed the situation, showing at the same time composure and professional excellence. ""According to international rules aircraft while performing approach has an absolute priority over all the aircraft located on the ground."" FAA: 2 jetliners get too close for comfort over Houston .

"(CNN) -- Colleen Hufford, 54, was beheaded by Alton Nolen during a surprise attack at a Vaughan Foods plant in Oklahoma last week, according to police. Thankfully, before the terrorist -- yes, terrorist -- could behead another victim, Traci Johnson, he was shot by the company's CEO, Mark Vaughan, who is also a deputy sheriff. The terrorist survived. Hufford, a wife, mother, and grandmother, did not. Her husband of 25 years was outside Vaughan Foods that afternoon, waiting to pick her up as he did every day, when he learned she was the victim of a terrorist attack. It was a terrorist attack, and everyone knows it. Why won't the government say so? The Washington Post reports that the FBI found ""no indication that Alton Alexander Nolen was copying the beheadings of journalists in Syria by the Islamic State ... adding that they are treating this as an incident of workplace violence."" Workplace violence? You can't be serious! Oh wait -- the FBI must mean ""workplace violence"" as in the case of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the terrorist convicted in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting that killed 13 people and left many more wounded. Oh yeah, I remember that extremist attack carried out by a ""soldier of Allah"" -- but that's just workplace violence. It doesn't mean anything that Hasan is writing letters from death row to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, begging to become a citizen of the self-procaimed Islamic State. Just a guy who got angry at work. Prosecutor likely to seek death penalty . How dumb do you think we are? Fort Hood was an act of terrorism, the beheading of Hufford was an act of terrorism, and it's time the FBI, the President, and all of us started calling it that. There are three reasons. First, it's important to give this barbaric crime the label it begs for -- not just because of the charges it should carry and the punishment that should be handed down, but because it's important, at every turn, to draw a very clear distinction between ISIS extremists and the silent majority of Muslims who are just as horrified as non-Muslim Americans . More than 100 Muslim clerics and scholars just condemned ISIS, outlining in 17 pages why ISIS' actions are an ""offense to Islam, Muslims and to the entire world."" They, too, are unfairly tarnished with every barbaric, terrorist act performed in the name of their religion. Second, it's essential if we want to win the war on terror that we understand how technology has changed that war since 9/11. President Obama admitted that the United States ""underestimated"" ISIS. And in his speech before the United Nations, he described ISIS as a ""network of death"" that must be defeated. I agree. And this ""network of death"" has managed to reach beyond the confines of Syria and the Middle East. Thanks to the barbaric beheading videos, ISIS is in our living rooms and our news feeds and on our minds. And that's exactly how ISIS wants it. It makes those snuff videos precisely so we'll watch and talk about it, and so terrorists like Nolen will be inspired to perform acts of terrorism on U.S. soil. You can try to downplay the connection to ISIS by calling Nolen a lone wolf, a copy cat or a nut case, but there is evidence of a very real connection these lone wolves feel to terrorists, and we'd better stop ignoring it and passing it off as ""workplace violence."" After ISIS beheaded Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines, Algerian terrorists kidnapped and beheaded French hiker Herve Gourdel. Just last month Australian authorities uncovered and stopped an alleged terrorist plot to kidnap a random person who would be beheaded in a ""demonstration killing."" Nolen may not have been part of an active ISIS cell waiting around to make a coordinated strike, but he is a terrorist who sympathized with and was inspired by Islamic fundamentalist militants. Just last week, an ISIS leader, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, released a 42-minute recorded speech directed toward ""lone wolf"" operations encouraging terrorists like Nolen. ""Do not ask for anyone's advice and do not seek anyone's verdict, kill the infidel whether he is civilian or military."" I don't know if he watched this ISIS recruitment video, but apparently Nolen did watch beheading videos online. According to an article by Michael Daly in The Daily Beast, in March Nolen posted one to his Facebook page, under the pseudonym Jah'Keem Yisrael, with the caption: . ""This do we find the clear precedent that explains the particular penchant of Islamic terrorists to behead their victims, it is merely another precedent bestowed by their Prophet."" He also added a citation from the Quran: ""I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers; smite ye about their necks."" ""Smite"" means a heavy blow or stroke with a weapon. The terrorist who killed Colleen Hufford ""smote"" her neck when he cut it, reportedly with the same knife he used to slice produce when he worked at Vaughan Foods. According to Daly, Nolen posted photos of Osama bin Laden, other jihadis, and the Twin Towers burning. The Christian Science Monitor reported he wrote: ""She (the Statue of Liberty) is going into flames. She and anybody who's with her."" He posted photos of a woman being flogged, Daly wrote, with the words ""Islam will dominate the world. Freedom can go to hell."" There's nothing but evidence that Nolen was copying the ISIS beheadings in Syria. So let's drop the political correctness for once and call the Oklahoma beheading what it is -- terrorism.","Mel Robbins: Woman beheaded in Oklahoma is victim of terrorist attack .
She says FBI calls it workplace violence, but there's evidence of Alton Nolen's focus on ISIS .
She says denying this avoids new realities in war on terror: It's online, can affect us at home .
We risk tarnishing Muslim-Americans, overwhelmingly peace-loving, she says ."
"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- The Philippines struggled to bury the dead and get food, water and medicine to the living Tuesday, four days after Super Typhoon Haiyan claimed untold lives and flattened countless buildings. ""Right now, we don't have enough water,"" typhoon survivor Roselda Sumapit told CNN in Tacloban, a city of more than 200,000 that was flattened by the storm. What they can get may not be clean, she said -- but she added, ""We still drink it, because we need to survive."" The government's confirmed death toll was 1,774 early Tuesday, said Jose Lampe Cuisa Jr., the Philippine ambassador to the United States. The storm has injured 2,487 more, and displaced 660,000 people from their homes. Government officials have said they fear the final toll may be as many as 10,000. Corpses -- some crudely covered, others left exposed to the burning sun -- added another hellish element to survival in Tacloban, the capital of the southern island province of Leyte. ""We have bodies in the water, bodies on the bridges, bodies on the side of the road,"" said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine Red Cross. Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said authorities there have confirmed 250 deaths and expect that toll to climb. ""A lot of bodies were mixed up with all the rubble and debris, and we're getting reports also of some houses that were buried. And we see some bodies floating,"" Romualdez said. Another 14 people were reported to have died in Vietnam, where the storm made landfall after hitting the Philippines, the country's National Search and Rescue Committee reported early Tuesday. Another four were missing and 81 hurt, it said. And there were at least five storm-related deaths in southern China, where heavy rains caused flooding, destroyed houses and damaged farmland, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. In the Phillipines, troops and aid organizations battled blocked roads to deliver help and search for survivors in the splintered wreckage of homes. Tomoo Hozumi, the Philippines representative of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, said food, shelter, clean water and basic sanitation were ""in a severe shortage"" early Tuesday. ""The situation on the ground is very hideous,"" he told CNN's The Situation Room. The Philippine government reported early Tuesday that 2.5 million people needed food aid, including nearly 300,000 pregnant women or new mothers. ""Our house got demolished. My father died after being hit by falling wooden debris,"" one woman told the Philippine television network ANC. ""We are calling for your help. If possible, please bring us food. We don't have anything to eat."" International aid was beginning to work its way to the stricken islands. But Martin Romualdez, the area's congressman, said authorities need help clearing roads where power lines, trees and whole houses are ""literally strewn across the pavement of the highway."" Romualdez, the cousin of Tacloban's mayor, said airdrops may be needed to reach towns beyond Tacloban. ""We can't wait. People have gone three days without any clean water, food and medication,"" he told CNN's Piers Morgan Live. ""People are getting desperate. There's an exodus out of the storm-ravaged areas. People are just trying to make their way out, and it's causing a big, big jam on the main arteries that are used to get to these people."" Gordon said the threat of landslides and flash flooding further complicated the problem, and said police were needed to guard aid shipments: ""Any truck, any helicopter that lands is going to be surrounded by people in need,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360. Compounding the misery, a new tropical depression dumped heavy rain on the area Tuesday morning. The system, dubbed Zoraida by the Philippine meteorological agency, was centered southeast of the southern island of Mindanao, moving northwest with top winds of 55 kilometers per hour (35 mph). Dramatic vignettes show desperation, hope . 'Worse than hell' Haiyan struck Friday, sending a wall of water crashing into neighborhoods of wooden houses along the Gulf of Leyte and flinging large ships ashore like toys. Its top winds were estimated at 315 kph (195 mph) -- a figure that could set a new record for tropical cyclones if confirmed. Magina Fernandez, who was trying to get out of Tacloban at the city's crippled airport, described the situation there as ""worse than hell."" ""Get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow, now,"" she said, directing some of her anger at Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, who toured some of the hardest-hit areas Sunday. Aid pledges began to pour in on Monday -- $25 million from the United Nations, 3 million euros ($4 million) from the European Union, 10 million pounds ($16 million) from Britain and $10 million from the United Arab Emirates, home to a large population of expatriate Filipino workers. U.N. and U.S. civilian disaster assessment teams were on the scene. U.S. Marines based in Japan worked to outfit Tacloban's shattered airport with lights, radar and other gear to allow it to operate 24 hours a day. The United States also announced that the aircraft carrier USS George Washington and three escort ships have been dispatched to the Philippines to assist in recovery efforts. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the carrier to head for the islands at ""best speed"" from Hong Kong, where it was on a port visit, the Pentagon said. Two other American vessels, including a supply ship, are already headed for the Phillippines, the Pentagon said. The U.S. Agency for International Development is sending emergency shelter materials and basic hygiene supplies to aid 10,000 families as well as 55 metric tons of emergency rations sufficient to feed 20,000 children and 15,000 adults for up to five days. Both shipments were expected to arrive this week, the agency said. And British Prime Minister David Cameron announced Monday night that his government was also sending a cargo plane and the destroyer HMS Daring to assist, he said. Typhoon Haiyan: Reports from the field . Difficult to assess death toll . But Tacloban is far from the only devastated area. Authorities are trying to establish the level of destruction elsewhere along Haiyan's path, and other settlements along the coast are likely to have suffered a similar fate to Tacloban's. Interactive map of the storm . Aid workers said the recovery from Haiyan will take many months. ""This disaster on such a scale will probably have us working for the next year,"" said Sandra Bulling, international communications officer for the aid agency CARE. ""Fishermen have lost their boats. Crops are devastated. This is really the basic income of many people."" Across the Gulf of Leyte lies Samar, where Haiyan made its first of six deadly landfalls on the Philippines on Friday. Government and aid officials say they are still trying to reach many affected communities on that island. A similar challenge exists farther west, on the islands of Cebu and Panay, which also suffered direct hits from the typhoon. Aquino declared a ""state of national calamity,"" which allows more latitude in rescue and recovery operations and gives the government power to set the prices of basic goods. Authorities are funneling aid on military planes to Tacloban's airport, which resumed limited commercial flights Monday. As aid workers, government officials and journalists came in, hundreds of residents waited in long lines hoping to get out. Tacloban stadium before and after . 'They've lost everything' The problems are the same in other stricken regions. ""The main challenges right now are related to logistics,"" said Praveen Agrawal of the U.N.'s World Food Programme, who returned to Manila from the affected areas Sunday. ""Roads are blocked, airports are destroyed."" The need for food and water has led to increasingly desperate efforts. People have broken into grocery and department stores in Tacloban, and local businessman Richard Young said he and others had formed a group to protect their businesses. ""We have our firearms. We will shoot within our property,"" he said. Authorities have sent police and military reinforcements to try to bring the situation under control. Another dire scene played out in the city's only functioning hospital over the weekend. Doctors couldn't admit any more wounded victims because there wasn't enough room. Some injured lay in the hospital's cramped hallways seeking treatment. ""We haven't anything left to help people with,"" one doctor said. ""We have to get supplies in immediately."" Complicating the search efforts is the lack of electricity in many parts of the storm's path. The northern part of Bogo, in the central Philippines, suffered a blackout Sunday, and authorities said it will take months to restore power. Storm moves onto Vietnam . Meteorologists said it will take further analysis to confirm whether Haiyan -- with gusts reported at first landfall to be up to 235 mph (375 kph) -- set a record. After leaving the Philippines, the storm lost power as it moved across the South China Sea over the weekend. It hit the coast of northern Vietnam early Monday and weakened as it moved inland. Vietnamese authorities had evacuated 800,000 people ahead of the typhoon, according to the United Nations. Aid workers said Vietnam was likely to avoid damage on the scale suffered by the Philippines but warned that heavy rain brought could cause flooding and landslides in northern Vietnam and southern China. Philippines gets more than its share of disasters . Paula Hancocks and Ivan Watson reported from Tacloban; Matt Smith reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Catherine E.

"At just 21 years old, Yityish Aynaw has gone on a remarkable life journey from a little girl playing barefoot in an Ethiopian village to an Israeli beauty queen who's ready to shine on the world stage. Last February, the stunning 21-year-old grabbed international attention after becoming the first woman of African descent to be crowned Miss Israel at the country's beauty pageant. ""To be first, you have all the attention focused on you and I have to represent my whole ethnic group because through me they see the models,"" says Aynaw, who will represent Israel at the next Miss Universe contest. ""Through me they see and discover our whole ethnic group."" Read this: Darfur's amazing street fashion . Aynaw was born in Chahawit, a small village in northern Ethiopia, near the city of Gondar. Her father died when she was young and when she was just 12 years old she lost her mother to a painful illness. Heartbroken, she arrived in Israel with her brother to live with their Ethiopian Jewish grandparents. ""The journey was, I think, what saved me,"" she says. ""Because I was deeply hurt and I wanted to escape from Ethiopia and forget everything that had happened and get on with it,"" she adds. ""I wanted to break away from everything and go on."" While still a child, Aynaw was suddenly faced with a new language, a new culture and all the rest of challenges that come with starting a new life in a foreign country. Like the estimated 125,000 Ethiopian Jews who have gone in waves over the years to Israel, Aynaw experienced the same struggle to assimilate into her new environment. But Aynaw threw herself at it, not shying away from all that her adopted country expected of her, including mastering Hebrew and serving in the Israeli army after school. ""It is three of the most significant years in my life,"" says Aynaw about her time in the military. ""There I learned a lot about myself; there I developed,"" she adds. ""I was a girl of 19 and the army gave me structure."" Read this: The African beauty empowering women . After finishing her army service, Aynaw started working as a sales clerk in a clothing store. Tall and beautiful, she long had her eye on becoming a model but she never thought about taking part in a pageant. Instead, it was a friend of hers who entered her name into the Miss Israel competition. ""We were always laughing about it,"" says Aynaw, who also goes by the nickname Titi. ""I'd not registered during the time of my studies because I was really busy -- the army is the army, I couldn't. So when I ended she said to me 'you have got no more excuses and I am going to register you.'"" Her win in February changed her life instantly. Within a matter of weeks, her name and image were splashed across newspapers and websites, both in Israel and abroad. The publicity also caught the attention of one of her heroes: Aynaw was invited to an exclusive state dinner for Barack Obama in honor of his first visit to Israel as U.S. president. ""This was an incredible moment,"" she says. ""He was a figure that I want to emulate. I did a project on him in school and I knew what he had been through and what he had done. He was like a mentor for me, so to meet him and say hello, it was like closing a circle."" Aynaw says she had never expected something like this would happen to her. ""Suddenly I thought about the little girl who had suffered and the little girl whose only dream was to run and play the whole day. The pain I went through; I saw it all,"" she says. Read this: Designer takes African colors to America's Deep South . As the first ever black Miss Israel, Aynaw is seen by some as a beacon of hope that racial prejudice is beginning to fade away in the country. Aynaw says that she's never been the victim of racism but adds that there have been instances where friends of hers have been treated differently because of the color of their skin. ""I am aware of the feeling, even if it did not happen to me,"" she says. ""I know it [racism] exists in the country and the whole world,"" adds Aynaw. ""It is something that has to be dispelled."" A pained little girl who has turned into a strong young woman, Aynaw is now hoping to carve out a successful career in fashion and also serve as a role model for her community. And although her future seems set to be filled with glamorous days, Aynaw says ultimately her formula for a happy life rests on one thing. ""I have always dreamed of having a big family, a big house and a lot of kids,"" she says. ""I want to give my kids the experience I never had. That is my great dream.""","Yityish Aynaw, 21, is the first woman of African descent to win Miss Israel pageant .

"It's been nearly two years since Xi Jinping assumed paramount leadership in China and the world has mixed feelings about him. The latest Pew Research Center findings show that Xi has received mostly negative ratings from those surveyed in the West, the Middle East, and long-time rivals Japan and the Philippines. However, the president is viewed favorably in several neighboring countries, as well as in Africa. Back home in China, Xi also receives overwhelmingly good ratings, with 92% of Chinese people polled expressing confidence in him. To many China watchers, such a mixed bag of ratings confirms that Xi remains a cipher. People -- both inside China and out -- are still debating: Is Xi Jinping a reformist or tyrant? The man who took over the Communist Party's paramount post in November 2012, and six months later the state presidency, certainly has the pedigree for leadership. The son of a respected Communist guerrilla leader who was an ally of Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's reform program, Xi grew up in Beijing with fellow ""princelings"" and political elite. Since taking control, he's assumed a raft of top posts in the Party, the government and the military; some China watchers have dubbed him ""Chairman of Everything."" Orthodox reformist . China's leader faces a long list of challenges: Economic slowdown, corruption, growing gap between the rich and poor, rising criminality, environmental and ecological degradation. Simmering ethnic tensions in the frontier regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, which in recent months have witnessed some of the worst ethnic violence, are also cause for worry, as are territorial disputes with Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam. ""The Party is beset by crisis because it is moving into an era where so many sociopolitical challenges need to be addressed,"" says Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese Politics and director of the China Studies Center at the University of Sydney. Xi's political resume shows that he's ideally placed for implementing reform, particularly economic. As a provincial leader in southern China, Xi was in charge of free market-dominated economies. ""All evidence shows he worked well with them, and was always very cautious,"" says Brown,  who is also the author of ""The New Emperors: Power and the Princelings in Modern China."" ""Xi's record shows an orthodox reformist, nothing more."" Contradictions . Yet, after almost two years at the helm of the world's second-largest economy, his policies and promises suggest that he is a bundle of contradictions. While some see him as a reformer, others view him as a throwback. To tighten his grip on the 80-million strong Communist Party, he preaches ideological orthodoxy, and has revived some communist rhetoric and practices, such ""criticism and self-criticism"" sessions. And he's also cracked down on China's nascent dissenting voices. In recent months, China has detained scores of liberal intellectuals and many more civil rights activists. He has also silenced raucous bloggers. These examples of heavy-handedness have dashed earlier hopes that Xi may be a potential liberal reformer. ""I don't think he is a reformist,"" says Teng Biao, a human rights lawyer and a leader of China's citizens' right movement. ""He is collecting power in order to be a dictator. He hates open politics -- liberal democracy -- but wants a powerful economy."" Economic primacy . Indeed, Xi is not wishy-washy on the belief that economic growth is essential to political and social stability -- and the survival of the Communist Party. ""Xi Jinping's core aim is to rejuvenate the Communist Party in order to push through drastic free market reforms that he believes will make China a modern, prosperous world power,"" says Sidney Rittenberg, a seasoned China-watcher and author of ""The Man Who Stayed Behind"", a book about his experiences in China. ""This means nothing less than a new revolution in China."" To succeed, ""Xi must overcome resistance from jaded bureaucrats who stand to lose power and privileges."" ""New revolution"" Even as Xi seeks to silence dissent and consolidate power, he has started to address sensitive issues. Some of his planned reforms are aspirational, some are underway, but all have the potential to drastically affect the Chinese political, social and economic landscape in China. Chief among these is the issue of labor camps, which operate outside the judicial system and have been blamed for human rights abuses and injustices. Xi's reform system could have a direct impact on this system. He's also taken to task the draconian and unpopular one-child policy, which have been blamed for cases of forced abortion and infanticide -- late last year the government announced plans to relax the restrictions, chiefly for parents who were single children themselves. He also plans to liberalize the ""hukou"" residence registration system, which restricts rural migrants' rights in cities, freeing up migration and, in theory at least, developing a more mobile, dynamic workforce. Economically, he proposes allowing increased competition in state-dominated industries, further moving the country away from an outdated, inefficient centralized model. He's also looking to drastically alter the country's definition of economic success, by ending the obsession with GDP growth and instead aim for quality, not quantity. One of the more eye-catching reforms that Xi has in mind, perhaps crucially, is a plan to build a more independent judiciary. The political impact of a move away from the much-maligned system remains to be seen. Xi's boldest gambit so far, however, is the anti-corruption campaign which has already snared thousands of bureaucrats, military officers and enterprise managers. They include scores of formerly powerful senior leaders in the Communist Party and the military. Long-term strategy . ""He is tactically focusing on the soft targets -- corruption, inefficiency in the state sector, reform of fiscal decision-making -- before moving onto much harder ones,"" says Brown. Xi is expected to stay in the No. 1 seat for eight more years, assuming he will get a second five-year tenure, as has been the unwritten norm since Deng Xiaoping's death in 1997. Long-term, he faces a tougher challenge. ""Growth alone is not enough,"" says Brown. ""Equity, balance and political issues are demanding some answers."" ""Xi and his leadership have to convince enough Chinese that the good years ahead are worth sacrifice now, and that it is worth continuing to invest in the current political model because it will deliver the 'rich and strong nation' that has been the Chinese Dream since 1949."" Regardless of the direction he is pursuing, Xi's strength and conviction should be enough to ensure that his own vision is realized.","Pew Research Center finds Xi is failing to make a positive impression globally .

"In a decision sure to cause debate, a New Mexico judge has ruled that terminally ill, mentally competent patients have the right to get a doctor to end their lives. The landmark decision Monday by New Mexico Second Judicial District Judge Nan Nash came after a two-day trial and could make New Mexico the fifth state to allow doctors to prescribe fatal prescriptions to terminal patients. The ACLU and Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life choice advocacy group, filed the lawsuit on behalf of two New Mexico doctors and cancer patient Aja Riggs. The judge was asked to consider whether the doctors should be allowed to write prescriptions for a terminally ill cancer patient who wanted to use drugs to end her life. ""This Court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private or more integral to the liberty, safety and happiness of a New Mexican than the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose aid in dying,"" the judge wrote.  ""If decisions made in the shadow of one's imminent death regarding how they and their loved ones will face that death are not fundamental and at the core of these constitutional guarantees, than  what decisions are?""

The practice has been hotly debated since it was first adopted in Oregon in 1997. But Riggs, the 50-year-old terminally ill cancer patient named in the New Mexico lawsuit, says she's glad she now has a choice. ""I am really pleased that the court has recognized that terminally ill patients should have more choice in the manner of their death,"" said Riggs. The cancer is currently is in remission, but Riggs says statistically her cancer is likely to return. ""Most Americans want to die peacefully at home, surrounded by loved ones, not die in agony in a hospital,"" she said. ""I feel the same way.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank took to the streets in mass demonstrations Tuesday demanding an end to the inter-Palestinian political division and an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. The largest protest took place in the coastal enclave of Gaza, where tens of thousands waved Palestinian flags and chanted, ""The people want to end the political division"" in imitation of the chants made by Tunisian and Egyptian protesters earlier this year. During the course of the rally, a group of Hamas supporters in Gaza tried to disrupt the demonstration by waving their own flags and chanting pro-Hamas slogans. The two sides briefly clashed with stone-throwing and fistfights. The Ministry of Interior in Gaza ordered protesters to leave the streets by nightfall, and security personnel were dispatched to confront those who refused to leave, according to witnesses. Witnesses reported several protesters were injured when Hamas dispersed the demonstrators in Gaza, with broken bones among the injuries. Medical sources in Gaza refused comment. The Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, publicly called on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to join his Fatah party in an urgent meeting to renew efforts at achieving political reconciliation. Hamas and the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority have been bitterly divided since 2007, when Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in a violent coup. In the West Bank city of Ramallah, thousands of demonstrators representing a varied cross-section of Palestinian society called on the government to do more to bridge the political divide. Najwan Baricdar, a youth activist and event organizer, told CNN the rally was inspired by the recent revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt and that many of the youth participants in the rally are fed up with the state of Palestinian politics. ""Our main demand is freedom, justice and right of return, which is the main Palestinian principle,"" she said. ""In order to achieve that, we ask for holding PNC elections."" PNC is the Palestinian National Council. She criticized the involvement of various political factions, which she accused of attempting to hijack the event by ripping down event banners and disrupting the peaceful march. On hand at the site of the rally were a dozen Palestinian hunger-strikers, who pledged not to eat until the political parties reconcile. Mo'az Muslehone, of the strikers, said politicians ignore the people's message at their own peril. ""People will not stop until ending the division, and if you don't end it ... they will end it in a different way."" He said Palestinian police attempted to prevent them from sleeping in the square Monday night. Independent lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti told CNN that the demonstration represents a new voice of the youth calling for democracy. ""What you see is the beginning of change, what you see is the voice of the young people and the silent majority among the Palestinians which are pressuring both Fatah and Hamas to end this terrible division, to end this internal competition about an authority which does not exist because it is all under occupation,"" Barghouti said. ""You see the voice of the Palestinian majority asking for democracy back and asking for unity, which is the only way to end occupation and the suffering of the people."" In a statement released after his weekly Cabinet meeting, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad welcomed the youth movement, calling it a ""means of ending the occupation and achieving national readiness for statehood.""

"(CNN) -- The issue of whether the death penalty in America is administered in a cruel and unusual manner has jumped back into the headlines with botched lethal injection executions in Oklahoma and Arizona. The Arizona case includes reports that the process took in excess of an hour and a half while the prisoner emitted sounds variously described as snoring or gasping for air. This month, a federal judge decided to overrule the U.S. Supreme Court in striking down the California death penalty as a form of ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. Judge Cormac Carney blasted a ""dysfunctional"" California justice system that leaves hundreds of murderers ""languishing"" on death row awaiting only the remote possibility of execution. The implication is that convicted rapist/murderer Ernest Jones suffers from some constitutionally impermissible form of mental torment in being forced to wait too long for an execution that may never come. The prisoner's 25 years of anguished death contemplation, incidentally, was caused in large part by the state and federal appeals he filed seeking to stop or postpone his execution. The judge blames only California for this delay, rather than the prisoner filing the endless appeals. Arizona execution raises questions over novel lethal injections . The judge apparently assumes that each time Jones wins yet another postponement of his execution, he suffers more. The ruling reminds me of the old story of the man who murders his mother and father and later pleads for the mercy of the court on the grounds that he is an orphan. In the meantime, his victim, Julia Miller, the mother of his girlfriend, remains buried in the cold ground, her opportunity to experience anguish having last occurred when she was bound with a telephone cord, gagged with rags in her mouth, raped and then stabbed 14 times, including once in her vagina. Two kitchen knives were protruding from her neck when discovered by her distraught husband of 30 years. Eight months later, he too was gone, having ""grieved himself to death,"" according to his daughter during the penalty phase of Jones' trial. There was no doubt of guilt here, given iron-clad evidence including Jones' sperm that was DNA identified after recovery from the victim. Opinion: Botched executions can't be new norm . This unpleasant recitation of the facts of the case was conveniently omitted from the judge's decision and a New York Times editorial endorsement of the concept that procedural delays in the appellate process are ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. With a little refinement and some well-funded legal defense projects, the Times and the judge could probably empty most of America's prisons with this theory. Though the judge painstakingly attempts to establish that Jones bears little responsibility for the delay, the argument is disingenuous. Most of the appellate review was sought by Jones, and though slowed by state funding deficiencies, it never would occur but for the prisoner's filings. Yes, he has a right to appeal, but the law does not permit a cancellation of the penalty when the review process is slow. The ruling is also astonishing in that the U.S. Supreme Court has in the past upheld death by firing squad, hanging, lethal gas, electrocution and lethal injection. None of these methods of inflicting death violate the Eight Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, according to the high court. Opinion: Five ways to improve the U.S. death penalty . These methods surely impose a level of suffering far in excess of Jones' mental distress occasioned by the system's ""arbitrary"" and ""capricious"" failure to put him swiftly to death. The court has also ruled that the death penalty properly serves a legitimate societal interest in ""deterrence and retribution."" To contend seriously that Jones suffered ""cruel and unusual punishment"" in not being swiftly put to death is a mockery of sensible legal analysis and simple common sense. The Supreme Court has examined this concept of procedural delays as a basis for attacking the death penalty and rejected the notion in a line of cases arising from a legal concept known as ""laches."" Though rarely invoked, it stands for the proposition that unwarranted delay can be so prejudicial that the court can refuse to impose an otherwise legal penalty. Cormac's widely heralded decision is actually damaging to serious efforts to abolish the death penalty in America because it is nonsensical and so heartlessly impervious to the suffering of the unmentioned victim. Before the death penalty can be eliminated, the public must be convinced that the punishment of death is barbaric and purposeless in modern society. Death penalty opponents squander their credibility with the public by adopting Jones' case as an example of death penalty injustice. Given the barbarity of Jones' crime, this is a poster case for administration of the death penalty after appropriate appellate review and safeguards. Death penalty facts that may surprise you . The supreme irony here is that opponents of the death penalty, who have spent years attempting to slow and obstruct its administration, are now asserting that the very deliberate examination of death penalty cases that they advocate has caused the penalty to become a form of ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. This is intellectual dishonesty and hypocrisy at its worst. Reasonable people can differ about the propriety or even the morality of the death penalty. I remain deeply conflicted myself about the appropriateness of the punishment in modern America. Supreme Court justices have spoken of ""evolving standards of decency,"" and at some point in the near future, this country may join the ranks of other Western democracies in banning the ultimate penalty. But the final decision on this important issue should not be made by a single federal judge parsing through a statistical analysis of how long it takes to process the innumerable appeals filed at the explicit request of convicted murderers. The decision should be made by majority vote in the democracy we cherish, or less optimally by the Supreme Court of the United States. Those who seek in good conscience to abolish the death penalty need to select the cases that demonstrate their claim of injustice carefully. They need also to remember to tell us about the victims who lie silenced forever. And they should never advance an argument such as the one used in the case of Ernest Jones. For it is abundantly clear that the lengthy contemplation of a death so richly deserved will be never be viewed as cruel and unusual under the U.S. Constitution.","Paul Callan: Death penalty is major topic after reports of botched executions .

"Oscar-winning director James Cameron resurfaced Monday after plunging to the deepest known point in the world's oceans in his one-man submersible. His history-making solo venture to Challenger Deep, part of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, left him feeling ""complete isolation from all of humanity,"" he said. ""I felt like I literally in the space of one day have gone to another planet and come back."" At more than 10,900 meters (about 35,800 feet), the Mariana Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is tall. It has had only two previous human visitors: U.S. Navy Lt. Don Walsh and the late Swiss explorer Jacques Piccard, who descended to that spot in 1960. Map: Mariana Trench depth . Cameron is the first to make the trek alone. And he did so hours before he was due in London for the premiere of the 3-D version of his 1997 blockbuster movie, ""Titanic."" The man who was also behind ""Avatar"" went down in a high-tech vessel, the Deepsea Challenger, which he and a group of scientists and engineers constructed in Australia over the past eight years. The bottom was a ""very soft, almost gelatinous, flat plane, almost featureless"" and went as far as he could see, Cameron said, describing the ""vast frontier down there."" ""It's a completely alien world,"" he said. But he did not see the kind of large life forms that some might dream up, he said. ""We'd all love to think there are giant squid and sea monsters down there. We can't rule it out, but my bet is there aren't. What you're going to find is these very, very interesting animals, the likes of which we've never seen before, that have adapted to this extreme environment."" Opinion: Philippe Cousteau on the importance of deep sea exploration . In a video feed afterward from a large ship, Cameron told reporters, ""I had this idea that life would adapt, life would be able to adapt to the deepest place. But I don't think we're seeing that.  At a microbial level, yes, life is adapting."" He said he did not see fish at such depth.  ""The only free swimmers I saw were these little ... shrimplike animals,"" scavengers that devour potential food that falls, such as dead fish or whales. It's a cold, dark, ""completely black world that's devoid of sunlight"" and warmth, he said. Animals that far down are usually white with no pigment, he said. Some have eyes to see bioluminescence, while others have no eyes. The full trip took about seven hours, he said. While the journey went well, one technical glitch caused a problem, he said.  The hydraulics prevented him from using a manipulator arm to collect samples to bring back to the surface. Cameron said he's confident it will be fixed for the next trip. This trip is only the beginning, he said. Horrific tsunamis originate in the depths of the ocean, he said, suggesting that a better understanding could ultimately help societies understand and prepare for such disasters. And some believe life may have originated in what are now the oceans' lowest points, he said.  So the research could help answer some ""fundamental questions."" In an era in which anyone can use Google maps to zoom in on a satellite image of any part of the world, ""the last frontier that really exists"" on Earth is the deep ocean, Cameron said. Cameron reached the point near Guam at 7:52 a.m. Monday (5:52 p.m. ET Sunday), said Ellen Stanley, a spokeswoman for the National Geographic Society, which is working with Cameron on the project. Outfitted with special cameras and robotic arms, Deepsea Challenger is able to dive vertically at speeds of 500 to 700 feet per minute and can withstand immense pressure -- up to 16,000 pounds per square inch. The descent took 2 hours, 36 minutes. ""Just arrived at the ocean's deepest pt,"" he tweeted at the time. ""Hitting bottom never felt so good."" It wasn't immediately clear how Cameron managed to update his Twitter feed from such depths. When astronauts sent tweets from space, they were e-mailed to mission control, where support staff posted them to the astronauts' Twitter accounts. (But that changed in 2010, when the International Space Station received a special software upgrade that NASA called ""the ultimate wireless connection."") It is estimated that more than 750,000 marine species have not been formally described in scientific literature over the centuries, triple the number of those that have been. The figures exclude microbes; a 2010 marine life census estimates there are up to 1 billion kinds of those. At noon (10 p.m. ET Sunday), the sub broke through the surface after a quick 70-minute ascent. Billionaire businessman and adventurer Richard Branson and Patrick Lahey, an experienced submarine pilot, had also sought to make the first solo trip to Challenger Deep. The nonprofit X-Prize Foundation has announced it will award a $10 million prize to the first person to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Cameron said he's not interested in competing for this prize, or any other, because his mission is purely about scientific research. ""You know, there's so much we don't know,"" Cameron recently told CNN. ""I'm hopeful that we'll be able to study the ocean before we destroy it.""","It felt like another planet, director James Cameron says .

"An Iraq war veteran who was arrested after jumping a White House fence suffers from PTSD, his former stepson told CNN Sunday. Omar Gonzalez hopped the north fence Friday and sprinted just past the north portico White House doors when he was stopped, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said. The veteran carried in his pants pocket a Spyderco VG-10 folding knife with a 3-and-a-half inch serrated blade, according to an affidavit. A Secret Service officer said he yelled at the intruder to stop. Gonzalez told a Secret Service agent ""that he was concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing and needed to get the information to the President of the United States so that he could get the word out to the people,"" according to the affidavit. Gonzalez is accused of unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon, officials said. As of Saturday, Gonzalez was in custody and set to appear in court Monday. President Barack Obama and his family were not at home at the time. On Sunday, Gonzalez's former stepson Jerry S. Murphy told CNN that Gonzalez's eight-year marriage to his mother ended two years ago -- information that marriage records supports. Murphy said he last spoke to Gonzalez around the time of the split but knows that Gonzalez was seeing a therapist on base at Fort Hood in Texas. Gonzalez was diagnosed with PTSD and paranoia, and his base psychiatrist had prescribed the veteran medication for both conditions, Murphy said. Gonzalez did three tours in Iraq and is a ""great, great guy,"" his ex-stepson said. Murphy views Gonzalez as a ""hero"" who took great pride in serving his country. But after each deployment, Gonzalez's mental state seemed to deteriorate, Murphy said. The veteran acted constantly ""alert."" Murphy feels that Gonzalez should have been given more help and doesn't think Gonzalez had intentions of hurting anyone at the White House. The knife that was found in Gonzalez's pocket was a weapon the veteran routinely carried, Murphy said. Criticism of White House security . The fence jumping incident was not the only security breach at the White House over the weekend. In a second incident Saturday, Kevin Carr of Shamong, New Jersey, was arrested after driving up to a security barrier and trying to enter the White House by walking to it. Carr was arrested and charged with unlawful entry, Leary told CNN. Records show Carr was born in 1995, making him around 19. According to Leary, the incident happened at the entrance at 15th and E streets, where the driver did not stop when the Secret Service ordered him to do so. The man's car did not hit the barriers at the entrance, and he then got out of his vehicle. Carr was arrested after he refused to leave, Leary said. The Obamas were not at home at the time of the second incident either. Minutes before Gonzalez jumped the fence, the President and his daughters left the South Lawn by helicopter. It is not clear where first lady Michelle Obama was, but officials tell CNN that the family was staying at Camp David, Maryland, for the weekend. The Secret Service said Gonzalez should have been stopped faster and are investigating personnel and reviewing security policies and procedures. The Secret Service is planning to beef up its presence and enhance its surveillance measures around the White House on Monday following Friday's security breach, a federal law enforcement official said. Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, suggested that the Secret Service has lapsed in the testing and audits that would have kept security up to standard. ""We see this a lot. It happens frequently in other places where there are static security forces, and it's just a matter of the Secret Service upping their game to make sure that they can maintain that every detail matters. A door locked, a quick reaction when somebody hits the fence and over the gate,"" Rogers said on CBS on Sunday morning. ""I think they are going to have to reinstate some of these ongoing checks about what activities they participate in."" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, demanded a full investigation and called for a congressional hearing to ensure that changes are made. ""There can be a lot of conspiracies against a president. A lot of very complex assassination plots,"" King said on Fox News. ""This is the most basic, the most simple type of procedure and how anyone, especially in these days of ISIS, and we're concerned about terrorist attacks, someone could actually get into the White House without being stopped is inexcusable."" In a statement from White House on Saturday night, spokesperson Frank Benenati said the President expressed his support for the Secret Service. ""The President has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House,"" the statement read. ""The Secret Service is in the process of conducting a thorough review of the event on Friday evening, and we are certain it will be done with the same professionalism and commitment to duty that we and the American people expect from the USSS.""

"Lisa and Joe's marriage was all but over. After his return from Iraq, they optimistically went about forging a life together. They married in 2009, got good jobs and moved into a nice house on Long Island, New York. For Lisa, the war was the past. But for Joe, it never faded away. Even as the years went by and he left the Marine Corps, his mind drifted back and the awful memories grew more intense. They took control of his dreams and gradually replaced his gentle demeanor with rage. He drank heavily. Lisa didn't know what was wrong with her husband. But his struggle resulted in her own painful memories. One is especially vivid. Reaching for something in their freezer one day, she dropped a bowl of spaghetti sauce on the kitchen floor. Her husband exploded. Mistakes can't be made, he angrily warned her. In Iraq, mistakes could get someone killed. ""It was startling. It was shocking to see that something falling could cause so much panic in him,"" she said. ""Why did he react this way? Where were all these feelings coming from? I didn't really have an answer for any of it."" In November, Lisa and Joe sat down with me in their Long Island home. They've come a long way since that tense night in their kitchen. Still, they insisted their real names not be used in this story and asked CNN to obscure their faces in a video interview because of the stigma associated with post-traumatic stress. They were afraid his boss and co-workers might recognize them. But they wanted to tell their story so that more people would know about a first-of-its-kind clinic they credit for saving their marriage. In January 2013, the couple began getting therapy at the Unified Behavioral Health Center for Military Veterans and their Families in Bay Shore, on Long Island's South Shore. A counselor at the local VA told Joe that he should check out this clinic that opened in December 2012. Civilians and veteran clinicians work together . The center's concept sounds simple. But it's revolutionary. Typically, the VA does not treat family members unless the veteran asks for it. But at the center, family members are equally empowered to get treatment, and they can get it with their soldiers in a single, shared space. Here's how it works: When a veteran or a family member walks through the front door, the family member turns to the left and is seen by a civilian clinician. The service member or veteran turns to the right and is seen by a VA therapist. They also have the option to be treated together. Dr. Charlene Thomesen, a psychiatrist and the associate chief of staff for Mental Health Services at the VA Medical Center in Northport, was among a small group that came up with the idea. Thomesen and her colleagues made sure the private side of the clinic was staffed with counselors trained to treat children, she told me. ""There's the issue of newly returning service members being younger and having young families -- the VA does not have expertise to treat children,"" she said. ""I always saw that as a need."" With their patients' permission, the VA and private clinicians meet regularly to share details of their respective sessions and devise the best way to treat the family as a whole. For example, a veteran who is on a sobriety plan may say in therapy that he isn't drinking but the wife tells her therapist otherwise. Or perhaps one partner reveals there's physical abuse in the home. Knowing more allows therapists to get to the heart of their patients' problems. Joe and Lisa believe this full-circle approach is exactly what they needed. After the first session together with a therapist, Joe wasn't sure he wanted to continue. ""One of my biggest fears was that this guy was going to dismantle my marriage,"" he said. ""He was going to show me that it wasn't worth it or we weren't meant for each other."" Lisa had her fears, too. She assumed that by being completely honest about her feelings, she was burdening her husband when he'd already been burdened enough by war. Therapy emboldened her to tell him how she felt, and he reassured her. ""It really touched me to know that while I worried about him,"" she said, ""he was worried about me."" So Lisa kept gently pressing, making their appointments because, at this clinic, she could. Iraqi war veteran encourages patients to get help . Iraq veteran Andrew Roberts can empathize with Lisa and Joe. As director of the Office of Military and Veterans Liaison Services for the clinic's parent health system, North Shore LIJ, it's his job to get out into the community and encourage veterans, service members and their families to come to the center. The job also helps him continue to heal. When the 38-year-old came home in 2004, he was constantly anxious and arguing with his father. ""He told me that it hurt him and I needed to see somebody,"" Roberts recalled. ""I was angry. I was thinking he should go see a therapist. Finally, after getting pretty worked up about it, I thought, 'Oh God, maybe I should go talk to somebody.' "" Counseling helped Roberts ease back into civilian life, and it strengthened his relationship with his dad. He turned to veterans groups for extra help, and that in turn made him confident enough to pursue a career in veterans affairs. Those jobs led him to his position with the clinic. ""For these veterans, they feel like I did; like you're the first person to ask for help,"" he said. ""I try to say to every one of them who comes in here -- a lot of our peers didn't make it home. I know that they would want us to live the best life possible. You can't live a good life, for some of us, without some professional help."" There is no cost for treatment, Roberts said, because the clinic is supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and local partners. The average length of time for treatment is three months, he said, but that depends on the individual's needs. Some patients may drop in whenever they feel they need to talk. By the end of 2013, the VA  had treated 499 patients on its side, according to Roberts, and the civilian side had treated 92 family members. The center tracks patients' progress in many ways, said its program director, psychologist Mayer Bellehsen. When a patient or couple begins treatment, a therapist measures their symptoms using nationally set standards for mental health. A patient could be assessed for PTSD, depression and anxiety.

"Director and actor Orson Welles once said, ""If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story."" Of course, the story of Occupy Wall Street and the movement it's sparking across the nation is just beginning to be written.  But those watching it unfold, especially those of us who are sympathetic to the movement, are eager to know how it might end. Will politicians start paying more attention to people instead of profits?  Will the ""99%"" persuade the ""1%"" to be more compassionate?  Will the protests spawn a new generation of engaged citizens, the ""flower power"" for the 21st century?  If the occupations aren't forcibly ended by authorities, how will they stay visible in our easily distracted society? And how will the protesters stay warm and dry? When I asked Occupy Wall Street organizer Jesse Myerson about the possible endgame of the movement, he replied, ""That's a dumb question. The movement isn't yet 3 weeks old.""  Fair point.  As a culture, we have a short attention span; we're too inclined to see everything as a sitcom and want to fast-forward to the end.  Myerson was being a bit evasive.  And this makes sense. Critics of Occupy Wall Street may demand to know the agenda -- the ending -- of the movement,  but perhaps its ongoing victory is that its story is even being told. Americans had become shockingly complacent in the face of outrageous inequality and injustice, seeming to defend the special rights of yacht-owning ""job creators"" while swallowing the notion that millions of our fellow citizens can be both working and poor.  One poster at Occupy Wall Street read, ""The light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off.""  That we're now having a public debate about inequality and the ugly road to nowhere on which many hardworking Americans are traveling suggests that, whatever Occupy's ultimate agenda, the process of movement building -- the fact of its existence -- may be its essential point. Social movements spring up not to achieve narrow policy goals but to shift the broader public debate, mobilizing public will toward change.  Polls show this movement's message against corporate greed not only has wider support than either political party in Washington but wider support than the tea party.  ""Occupy"" protests are springing up in unlikely places, from Idaho to Indiana, and drawing unlikely protesters like soccer moms, small-business owners and, yes, tea party members.  That you're even reading this column is evidence the protests are making a mark. Even if the 99% movement -- as it's coming to be known in some quarters -- fizzles in the coming months, historically it may be the spark that lights another flame that ultimately leads to change.  Just as interest on a bank account multiplies and compounds over time, so does outrage and resistance. Like any good story, the 99% movement is bound to have a cliffhanger, though it's too soon to predict when or what it will be. But expect it to come in the form of a significant demand that, if achieved, would dramatically transform our politics and economy for the better. Based on my conversations with participants at Occupy Wall Street, my sense is that the ultimate demand could be a radical reform to get money out of politics.  This might be a call for public financing of elections, new restrictions on lobbying contributions. There might even be a constitutional amendment saying the law should not treat corporations as people, effectively overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens' United ruling that allowing corporations and wealthy donors to spend more freely on campaigns. Incidentally, the American people widely support such campaign finance restrictions, but both Democrats and Republicans are chronically unwilling to forsake cash cow corporations and embrace reform. Creating huge public pressure to get corrupting money out of politics would be quite a happy ending for the protesters -- and our democracy. But even if ordinary Americans merely become more awake to the injustices of gaping inequality, if they now begin to fight back, then it won't matter where the story ends.  In the face of economic travail -- with 16 million American children living in poverty and with unemployment for African-Americans at more than double the already-alarming rate for white people -- the 99% are finally standing up together and taking action.  This foreshadows a much brighter future all of us. ""Meaningful change doesn't happen overnight,"" Occupy Wall Street organizer Beka Economopoulos told me.  ""We aren't talking end game now. We're just getting started."" Yet organizers seem to realize the point isn't how their story ends but how long they can keep it going, growing public consciousness and building pressure for change. ""At this time,"" Economopoulos said, ""we are only interested in impossible demands.""","Sally Kohn says Occupy Wall Street in early stages, but many are eager to know outcome .

"Rocky's been a fictional hero for decades, but in Edmonton, Alberta, today there's a hero named Rocky who is definitely real -- only he's 8 years old and has four legs. This Rocky, a Labrador retriever-husky mix, is being hailed for pulling a 9-year-old girl from an icy river on Easter Sunday. His owner, Adam Shaw, 27, is getting similar praise. ""If that man and dog weren't there -- I just try not to think of it,"" Miranda Wagner, the mother of Samara, 9, and her 10-year-old sister, Krymzen, said in an interview with CNN affiliate CTV. ""I just want to give him a big hug and tell him he's my hero. If he wasn't there I wouldn't have my girls,"" Wagner said. ""Doctors said two more minutes and Samara would have been gone."" Rocky and Shaw's heroics played out on the icy North Saskatchewan River in Edmonton on Sunday afternoon. The girls were tobogganing in a riverside park when they ended up on ice extending from the riverbank, their father, Corey Sunshine, told CNN affiliate CBC. ""From what I was told was, one of the toboggans came off the snowbank and onto the ice and they were trying to come back and the ice broke,"" he said. Shaw said he was walking on a bridge over the river when he heard screams.  Looking down on the river he saw one girl in the icy water and her sister trying to pull her out. By the time he and Rocky sprinted down to the river, both girls were in the water. He was able to pull Krymzen up onto the ice, but the current was carrying Samara downstream, about 4 or 5 feet from the edge of the ice, her head going in and out of the water, Shaw told a press conference Monday. He asked the girl if she could swim to him. ""She said she couldn't move her arms, couldn't move her legs,"" Shaw said. He tried throwing Rocky's leash to her but it didn't reach. Then, as he tried to get closer, the ice gave way beneath him and his dog. ""He managed to get his front paws on the ice and I pushed his back end up so he was on the ice, then I used the leash and him to kind of pull myself up onto the ice,"" Shaw said. By this time, Samara had drifted 50 or 60 yards farther down the river, still bobbing in and out of the ice-cold water. Shaw and Rocky ran to her again, but she was still out of reach. ""I put the leash around Rocky and pushed him to get in the water and I told her if she could get ahold of his leash, we could get her back to the ice,"" Shaw said. ""He jumped in right beside her,"" he said, and the girl managed to get both hands on Rocky's leash. ""I called him back and he swam toward the ice,"" Shaw said, getting close enough that he could grab both the girl's arm and his dog and drag them away from the water's edge. Fire rescue crews arrived shortly thereafter and took the sisters for treatment. On Monday, they were home with their grateful mother, and Shaw and Rocky were being honored at the fire station -- Shaw with a fireman's hat and Rocky with a giant rawhide bone he grabbed from Fire Chief Ken Block before Block could take off its plastic wrapper. ""These two young ladies are very, very fortunate that such a family happened along and were able to intervene,"" Block said. Shaw couldn't dispute that. ""I guess it's just a bit of a miracle that everything worked out perfectly,"" he told CTV.","Girls, 9 and 10, fell into Edmonton river while tobogganing .

"In a 2011 conversation about the Affordable Care Act, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the law more commonly known as Obamacare, talked about how the bill would get rid of all tax credits for employer-based health insurance through ""mislabeling"" what the tax is and who it would hit. In recent days, the past comments of Gruber -- who in a 2010 speech noted that he ""helped write the federal bill"" and ""was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well"" -- have been given renewed attention. In previously posted but only recently noticed speeches, Gruber discusses how those pushing the bill took part in an ""exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,"" taking advantage of voters' ""stupidity"" to create a law that would ultimately be good for them. The issue at hand in this sixth video is known as the ""Cadillac tax,"" which was represented as a tax on employers' expensive health insurance plans. While employers do not currently have to pay taxes on health insurance plans they provide employees, starting in 2018, companies that provide health insurance that costs more than $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family will have to pay a 40 percent tax. ""Economists have called for 40 years to get rid of the regressive, inefficient and expensive tax subsidy provided for employer provider health insurance,"" Gruber said at the Pioneer Institute for public policy research in Boston. The subsidy is ""terrible policy,"" Gruber said. ""It turns out politically it's really hard to get rid of,"" Gruber said. ""And the only way we could get rid of it was first by mislabeling it, calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans."" (The White House press secretary said at a press briefing in 2010: ""I would disagree with your notion that it is a tax on an individual since the proposal is written as a tax on an insurance company that offers a plan."") The second way was have the tax kick in ""late, starting in 2018. But by starting it late, we were able to tie the cap for Cadillac Tax to CPI, not medical inflation,"" Gruber said.  CPI is the consumer price index, which is lower than medical inflation. Gruber explains that by drafting the bill this way, they were able to pass something that would initially only impact some employer plans though it would eventually hit almost every employer plan. And by that time, those who object to the tax will be obligated to figure out how to come up with the money that repealing the tax will take from the treasury, or risk significantly adding to the national debt. ""What that means is the tax that starts out hitting only 8% of the insurance plans essentially amounts over the next 20 years essentially getting rid of the exclusion for employer sponsored plans,"" Gruber said. ""This was the only political way we were ever going to take on one of the worst public policies in America."" Unions and employers who object in 2018, he noted, ""at that point if they want to get rid of it they're going to have to fill a trillion dollar hole in the deficit...It's on the books now."" (When the Cadillac tax was first rolled out, it was explained by Obamacare backers as a tax that would only impact those with ""high end plans"" -- not all employer sponsored plans. A White House economic adviser in 2009 set ""the record straight"" by saying ""the excise tax levied on insurance companies for high-premium plans, the so-called 'Cadillac tax,' will affect only a small portion of the very highest cost health plans -- a total of 3% of premiums in 2013."") Gruber's are at about the 30:38 mark here. Former White House press secretary Jay Carney told CNN that Gruber's remarks in general were ""very harmful politically to the president."" Gruber ""speaks from the Ivory tower with remarkable hubris about the American voter and by extension the American Congress,"" Carney told The Lead with Jake Tapper. ""Any health care reform that sought to control costs and expand insurance would involve winners and losers. And that's always going to be the case."" Many of the videos were discovered by a Philadelphia-area financial adviser named Rich Weinstein who has spent the last year researching Obamacare after his family insurance premiums doubled. Weinstein told CNN that he had assumed, incorrectly, that since he liked his health insurance plan and he had insurance, he wouldn't be much impacted by the new law.","MIT economist Jonathan Gruber is considered the architect of Obamacare .

"Nearly 35 years ago, Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and began a painful chapter for America as the ""Great Satan."" Today, the building where anti-Americanism raged and captives were held for 444 days is now an Islamic cultural center and a propaganda museum of sorts for the Islamic Revolution. CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto visited the complex this week. It is rare for westerners to walk its halls. Although the two-story building shows no signs of terror from the 1979-81 hostage crisis, it remains a symbol of mistrust that still endures for many. Upon entering, the counter area where U.S. Marine guards had been posted when the embassy was seized is intact, as is the colorful tile work on some of the walls. There are offices on the first floor, while exhibits are displayed on the second. Upstairs is an office where CNN's guide says the CIA was housed. The entrance is the door to a vault. ""Is it the same combination that it was?"" Sciutto asks. ""Yes,"" the guide responds, explaining the students who stormed the building extracted the combination from hostages during what he said were ""negotiations."" Past the vault door, the Iranians claim was the secure section where the CIA worked. That's a reason the guide gives for the takeover, which was dramatized in the Oscar-winning film Argo. While many Iranians have grown disillusioned with the Islamic revolution, anti-American anger endures. ""Do you still believe it was justified to hold the Americans as hostages?"" the guide is asked. ""Definitely, yes."" he says. ""Based on international law the U.S. embassy should function as the embassy and not interfere in internal affairs. It's like somebody is snooping around your house. What would you do?"" Each room and every piece of equipment is an exhibit. There is a sound-proof meeting room, encrypted Telex machines -- one marked as belonging to the National Security Agency -- and the shredders said to have been used by embassy staff to destroy secret documents as the diplomatic facility fell to the revolutionaries. Revolutionary propaganda is everywhere. Bright red murals cover the main stairway walls leading to the second floor. The paintings tell a familiar Middle Eastern conspiracy theory claiming the United States was behind the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""Do you believe America brought down the twin towers?"" the guide is asked about the World Trade Center in New York. ""For sure, yes,"" he replies adamantly. Why would America would kill its own people? ""They wanted to make their people believe they are in danger so they could attack other countries,"" he says. ""Do you think that it's possible a plane can crash such a building?"" Officially, the United States and Iran have softened their tone more recently. The two are participating in international negotiations to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions over the long term in exchange for easing economic sanctions. An interim deal is in place for the next six months. ""Let's say America and Iran both abide by the agreement. Can you ever imagine American diplomats returning to this embassy?"" Sciutto asks the guide. He smiles and laughs. ""You cannot trust America,"" he says. ""America is the Great Satan.""","CNN tours old embassy building in Tehran - part time warp, part propaganda museum .

"A lengthy report on wait times at VA health care facilities in Phoenix found that 28 veterans had ""clinically significant delays"" in care, and six of them died, but investigators couldn't conclusively link their deaths to the delays. The scathing report, released Tuesday by the Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Inspector General, said the delays were because of scheduling issues. There were also 17 patients -- 14 of whom died -- in the review who received poor care but not as a result of access or scheduling issues. Read the full report (PDF) The majority of patient cases studied by investigators were on official or unofficial ""secret"" lists, according to the 133-page report, and experienced delays accessing primary care. Investigators studied 3,409 cases, including those of the 40 patients who died while on the Electronic Waiting List between April 2013 and April 2014. They outlined 45 separate cases in which veterans were negatively affected, including that of a man in his mid-60s who walked into the Phoenix VA with a massive lump on his chest. Despite tests being ordered, he was forced to wait nine weeks before he was given a biopsy and diagnosed with widely metastatic lung cancer. He later died. Another patient visited the VA emergency room several times for different complaints, and each time his chart noted very high blood pressure and recommended immediate follow-up care. The man, who was in his late 70s, never received an appointment and died within weeks of complications from his condition. ""While the case reviews in this report document poor quality of care, we are unable to conclusively assert that the absence of the quality of timely quality care caused the death of these victims,"" the executive summary of the report states. VA response . Earlier Tuesday, the VA leaked Secretary Robert McDonald's response to the report, highlighting the fact that there were no deaths directly linked to delays in care, but that statement lacked the context of the report's negative findings. Tuesday's report includes 24 recommendations, including determining an appropriate response to veterans who've been injured and a complete overhaul of the way appointments are scheduled and tracked. McDonald spoke at the American Legion's National Convention in North Carolina later in the day, agreeing to all 24 recommendations. He added that employees within the VA have been disciplined. ""Two members of the senior executive service have resigned or retired. Three members of the senior executive service have been placed on administrative leave, pending the results of investigations. Over two dozen health care professionals have been removed from their positions, and four more GS-15s or below have been placed on administrative leave,"" McDonald said, adding that the Office of Special Counsel is investigating 100 whistleblower allegations or retaliation complaints. McDonald took over the Department of Veterans Affairs after former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned in May, following the release of the inspector general's interim report. CNN's in-depth reporting . CNN has long reported about delays in getting care and scheduling problems at VA facilities nationwide. In November, a CNN investigation showed that veterans were dying because of long wait times and delays. In January, CNN reported that at least 19 veterans had died because of delays in simple medical screenings like endoscopies and colonoscopies, according to an internal document from the VA obtained exclusively by CNN. In April, retired VA physician Dr. Sam Foote told CNN that the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system kept a secret list of patient appointments that was intended to hide the fact that patients were waiting months to be treated. At least 40 patients died while waiting for appointments, according to Foote, though it is not clear whether they were all on secret lists. The Inspector General's report says ""we were able to identify 40 patients who died while on the EWL (Electronic Waiting List)"" from April 2013 to April 2014. It also confirmed that clerks were cooking the books to make the delays in wait times appear shorter. It said 69 members of staff admitted to hiding true wait times, ""fixing"" wait times and printing out requests for appointments and hiding them in desks instead of adding them to official wait lists. Read more about what Foote said . In June, a VA scheduling clerk in Phoenix, Pauline DeWenter, told CNN that records of deceased veterans were changed or physically altered to hide how many people died while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA hospital. Concerns about other facilities began emerging. Employees at VA centers in Wyoming, Texas and North Carolina alleged that there was a concerted effort to hide long wait times. In May, the inspector general said it was going to investigate 26 VA facilities. A June 9 internal audit of hundreds of Veterans Affairs facilities revealed that 63,869 veterans enrolled in the VA health care system in the past 10 years had yet to be seen for an appointment. President signals changes . President Barack Obama pledged Tuesday at the American Legion conference in North Carolina to ""get to the bottom of these problems."" He called the issues ""outrageous and inexcusable."" The President announced measures designed to improve care for veterans including expanded research into brain injuries, suicide prevention programs and services to ease the transition into mental health services after leaving active duty.

"Long before the ink had dried on the Senate deal to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, the writing was already on the wall for the Republican Party: The last three weeks have hurt them. They have borne the brunt of the blame for shutting down the government, and polls show that a large majority of Americans disapprove of the way the Congressional GOP has handled the fight over funding the government and raising the debt ceiling. Shutdown Poll: No winners but GOP bigger loser than Dems . Polls: Time to throw my guy out of Congress? And now, non-partisan political handicappers say the likelihood of Democrats winning the House and maintaining control in the Senate in 2014 has increased. ""Republicans have ratcheted up their risk,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. ""There is now a plausible case for the midterms being a plus for the Democrats, where I would never said that six months ago."" Rothenberg said the GOP is being perceived as ""a chaotic, disorganized, confused party"" and it is likely that their fundraising numbers will likely begin to slow in the coming months. ""Big dollar donors, who are more pragmatic business types, are now worried about where the party is going,"" he said. ""For Democrats, this helps them for 2014 in recruitment, in fundraising and in overall morale."" Conservatives and Obamacare . The deal, which the Senate and the House agreed to late on Wednesday, raises the debt ceiling until early next year and reopens the government that has been shut since October 1. The shutdown began because conservative Republicans - emboldened by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah -- pushed Republican leaders to tie funding the government with significant changes to Obamacare and Democrats refused. Throughout the 16-day shutdown, House Speaker John Boehner and his leadership colleagues listened to their caucus and demanded that President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats come to the negotiating table to make concessions on the presidents sweeping healthcare law. But when Democrats didn't budge -- only agreeing in the end to increase fraud protection on the healthcare program -- Republican leadership was forced to agree to a scaled back deal. In defeat, Boehner may live to fight another day . On top of drawing the ire of a majority of the American people, the back and forth highlighted a noticeable rift in the Republican party: between more pragmatic Republicans and their emboldened tea party colleagues. Poll: Tea Party's favorable numbers take a hit . Texas newspaper longs for Cruz's predecessor . As news of the deal broke, unhappy tea party groups, who saw the deal as a capitulation by the establishment Republicans in Washington, began to bang their primary challenger drum, promising to run against Republicans that didn't back tying Obamacare to the shutdown and debt ceiling. ""Congress will feel the repercussions of refusing to negotiate at all and for refusing to live under the same law the forced on the American people,"" Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots said, who told CNN to expect tea party groups to fervently challenger other Republicans in 2014. ""I expect tea party groups will be very active next year,"" Martin said. And Martin may be right. Just a quick look at Republicans running for reelection in the Senate shows tea party groups are already mobilizing to take on other Republicans. Challenges to incumbents . Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been a leading critic of Obama's policies on a number of fronts, but in heavily conservative South Carolina, a Republican incumbent can't take anything for granted. Graham faces a crowded primary field against state Sen. Lee Bright, businessman Richard Cash, and PR executive and Citadel graduate Nancy Mace. At this early stage of the race, Graham has the clear advantage in terms of money and organization. But that could change if conservative tea party activists begin to coalesce behind a single ""anyone-but-Graham"" candidate. The story is similar for Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is now seeking his third term in 2014. He faces a primary challenge from state Rep. Joe Carr and 2012 Senate candidate Brenda Lenard. Alexander is not a favorite among conservative tea party activists. In August, a coalition of 20 Tennessee tea party and conservative groups sent the Senator an open letter asking him to retire. And the highest profile GOP senate primary of 2014 pits three-term incumbent Mike Enzi of Wyoming against Liz Cheney, the eldest daughter of former Vice President and Wyoming favorite son Dick Cheney. The national party is backing Enzi, while Cheney has the backing of conservative activists. Many in the tea party see these races -- along with races in the House -- as an opportunity. ""The Republicans have had five years to try and make some progress in remedying the financial ills that plague our nation's future, and have made little to no progress,"" the Tea Party Express said in a written statement. ""The silver lining in all this is that the 2014 elections are just around the corner and 'We The People' have our chance to tell our leaders exactly how we feel about the 'compromise' reached today."" As tea party groups threaten Republican-on-Republican challenges, more moderate Republicans have publicly said that would be a bad idea. ""The way to achieve more conservative governance in 2015 is not spending $$ to defeat Republicans in 2014,"" Tim Miller, the executive director of the America Rising PAC, a Republican research firm, tweeted hours after the Senate deal was reached. Miller told CNN he still sees the political map in 2014 as favorable for Republicans, especially if they focus on beating Democrats on Obamacare and the debt. ""We need to take back the Senate and build on our House majority next November,"" Miller said. ""No progress can be made if that objective isn't met."" Miller continued: ""So I believe GOP and conservative groups interested in advancing a conservative agenda to focus their energy"" on defeating vulnerable Democrats in traditionally conservative states and districts. Democrats unified . Rothenberg said these divisions in the Republican Party -- between those seeking primary challenges and those seeking to target Democrats -- need to be worked out before the GOP can comfortably say they will keep control of the House. ""At some point, the tea party are going to really want to accomplish stuff,"" Rothenberg said. ""And in order to accomplish stuff, they are going to have to change their views about compromise and negotiations. If to them, victory is taking over an emasculated, weak, unsuccessful Republican Party, if that is what they think victory is, then maybe they can have victory."" All of this news, has been music to many Democrats ears, many of whom believe the last three weeks -- and the Republicans fledgling poll numbers around the shutdown -- have made it less likely the those vulnerable Democrats will lose in 2014. Before the shutdown, Jim Manley, a longtime Senate Democratic aide, said the vulnerability of Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina made Democrats losing control of the Senate a possibility. Now, he is far more bullish on his party's chances in both the Senate and House. ""I think that for the first time, in light of what has happened, I think for the first time we can honestly take a look at it and question whether it is possible"" to keep control of the Senate and win the House, Manley said. ""The Republican Party brand is broken and I am not sure if it can be fixed."" The key for Democrats, Manley pointed out, was their unity during the government shutdown. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi repeatedly delivered the majority of her caucus against House Republicans piecemeal plans to fund the government, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did the same in the Senate. ""That shows me,"" Manley said, ""that we are not scared of the tea party types like Democrats had been in elections past."" Opinion: Five reasons America is still in trouble after shutdown .

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- Four generals held without charges since 2005 in connection with the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri were freed Wednesday on orders from the U.N. tribunal investigating the killing. The tribunal investigating the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri orders generals' release. The four -- Jamil Sayyed, Ali Hajj, Raymond Azar and Mustafa Hamdan -- had been arrested after a coalition led by Hariri's son Saad swept to power in the wake of the assassination. They were met by well-wishers upon their release, with opposition lawmakers greeting Azar, Hajj and Sayyed. ""This never happened since the Ottoman times, even during the Syrian time, that people were just locked in jail for no reason and no charge,"" Sayyed said after being met by top lawmakers from the opposition party Hezbollah. He called for supporters to remember them in parliamentary elections scheduled for June, and ""let justice take over."" Sayyed was the director of Lebanon's internal security services at the time of the car bombing, which killed 22 others along with Hariri. Hajj was the country's domestic security chief; Azar was the head of military intelligence and Hamdan was in charge of President Emile Lahoud's security force. The U.N. tribunal convened to investigate Hariri's February 2005 death ordered the men released earlier Wednesday, declaring the evidence against them was ""not sufficiently credible to request the maintenance in detention of those persons."" Hariri was credited with rebuilding Beirut after the country's 15-year civil war ended in 1990. Many Lebanese blamed Syria, which had dominated Lebanon politically and militarily since the civil war, for the killing. The assassination sparked widespread protests that led to the election of an anti-Syrian bloc in parliament and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Damascus denies any role in Hariri's killing, but the U.N. investigation has found indications of Syrian involvement. In a speech following Wednesday's announcement, Saad Hariri said he accepted the order freeing the suspects ""because that shows the seriousness of the tribunal."" ""We said before that we don't want revenge from anyone, even those that we suspect were behind the crime,"" Hariri said. He added, ""We don't want any scapegoat. We want justice."" The U.N. tribunal opened in March, and the prosecution could take as long as 10 years, sources close to the probe said.

"We journalists tend to think of ourselves as public servants, but we sure don't act like it all the time. The institution has one foot firmly planted in elitism: Editors know what you need to know before you know you need to know it. It would be foolish to think that -- gasp! -- the public could help decide what matters. But things don't have to be that way, right? We're better people when we work together. It's in a spirit of democracy and inclusion that I'm asking you to vote on the stories I should cover over the course of the next 12 months for a new CNN project called Change the List. It's not that I don't have ideas about what I'd like to do, or that the views of professional journalists don't matter. They do. It's that I also trust your judgment and I want to write about issues you find important. Vote here: You pick it, CNN covers it . I also want you to participate in every part of the storytelling. With help from lots of smart people, I've selected 20 story ideas I think are worthy of your attention. Each highlights an extreme case: The country with the least access to toilets; the state with the highest incarceration rate; the nation where malaria is deadliest; the place where 1 in 100 live births kills the mother; the country where the largest number of new leprosy cases is diagnosed each year; the one country that ranks below North Korea on free speech. The goal, as the name Change the List suggests, is to start a conversation that could -- just maybe, and over time -- bump these places off the bottom of the list. It's a project that supports the world's underdogs. The aim isn't to shame the places at the bottom of the list; it's to give them a megaphone and support. Go to the Change the List homepage -- http://cnn.com/changethelist -- to pick your top five stories from the list of 20 before voting closes on Monday, June 17. Think of this as your chance to be a CNN assignment editor. You're my boss, in fact. (Dear people who pay me: Please keep doing that?) And as my new (and hopefully benevolent) Internet-based overlord, you have every right to tell me these 20 ideas are junk. Instead of firing me, I'd ask that you send me an e-mail (ctl@cnn.com) or a note on Twitter (@jdsutter) with an idea for a story you think is more important or interesting. We're going to include a sixth wild-card choice in the coverage plan -- and, while CNN's editors will have the final say, that idea could come from you. Since I hope you'll take me on as an employee, I should probably tell you a little bit about myself. I've been at CNN for more than four years now, covering all sorts of topics, from video gaming in South Korea to prisons in Norway and slavery in Mauritania. If there's one thing this place has taught me it's that stories are more powerful, memorable and meaningful when you participate in them. I saw this last month when strangers on Twitter helped me navigate a somewhat treacherous walk through the 17-mile path of an Oklahoma tornado. I wasn't alone on that two-day trek. I was on a journey with dozens of new friends. ""@jdsutter maybe I should tweet you a picture of the bottom of my foot as an example of why tetanus shots are important?"" And I saw it after dozens of CNN iReporters sent in ""messages of hope"" to former and escaped slaves in Mauritania, which I visited in 2011. Support videos came from all over: from Saudi Arabia to South Korea, California to Kentucky. ""I want you to know that all of us are so proud of you ...,"" one woman said to the group of former slaves, who were taking classes in Mauritania's capital. And I saw it last year when a videographer, Edythe McNamee, and I did the pilot for Change the List. We featured Hawaii, the U.S. state with the lowest voter turnout rate. Less than half of Hawaii's residents voted in the 2008 presidential election. We weren't able to change that in one month, of course, but we did get people talking. Hawaii tied West Virginia for 49th place in voter turnout in the November 2012 election. And, more meaningfully for me, three of the six nonvoters we featured as part of a story called ""Convince me to vote!"" ended up voting because of messages CNN's readers sent to them via social media. ""I feel good about it,"" one man said of his decision to vote for the first time. It's journalism with an agenda. I'm not ashamed of that. The main agenda is for your voice to be heard -- and for us to work together to amplify the voices of people that aren't often heard in the news. And it starts with a vote. So tell me, boss. What should we cover?","Vote on which of these stories you like best and CNN will cover the top five .

"An emotional Cristiano Ronaldo failed to hold back the tears as the Real Madrid and Portugal star won the Ballon d'Or at a star-studded FIFA Awards Ceremony in Switzerland. The forward finally ended the reign of Argentina's Lionel Messi, who had held the award since 2009, with Frenchman Franck Ribery finishing third. ""I am deeply moved,"" said the 28-year-old, who had played down the importance of the trophy in the run-up to Monday's ceremony. The former Manchester United star, who scored 66 goals in 56 games last year, was previously crowned the world's best in 2008. ""There are no words to describe how I feel,"" said Ronaldo, who won the prize despite winning nothing with either club or country in 2013. ""I'm delighted, I want to thank all my team-mates, all my family in the room. Those who know me know how many sacrifices I made to win this reward. ""I want to thank all those who had faith in me and I want to speak again about Eusebio and Madiba (Nelson Mandela) and to pay tribute to them one last time."" ""Each time is different. But I would say that this second Ballon d'Or is more emotional, because my mother and my son (who joined him on stage) are here."" Ronaldo won with 27.99% of the votes ahead of Messi (24.72%) while Ribery was third (23.36%) according to France Football, who jointly organize the award with FIFA. In 2013, he outscored Messi, who has struggled with injury, and scored a hat-trick to help his country negotiate a tricky World Cup playoff against Sweden in order to secure a berth at Brazil 2014. Ronaldo's golden ball is likely to take pride of place in his new museum. At last month's opening in his hometown of Funchal, Ronaldo told reporters: ""I have room for more trophies. I don't really want to mention specific ones. All I want is to win more awards and, if the Ballon d'Or comes, there is extra room here."" The Ballon d'Or is voted for by national team coaches, national team captains and a selection of journalists from around the world, selected by both France Football magazine and FIFA. The evening's other winners included Jupp Heynckes, the now-retired German who was crowned Men's Coach of the Year after leading Bayern Munich to an unprecedented Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble. He beat Alex Ferguson, who led Manchester United to a record 20th English championship in his final season at Old Trafford, and Borussia Dortmund manager  Jurgen Klopp, whose German side dazzled on their way to the 2013 European Champions League final. On a memorable night for Germany, national team coach Silvia Neid was named Women's Coach of the Year while goalkeeper Nadine Angerer won the Women's World Player award. Having saved two penalties in a 1-0 win over Norway in the final Euro 2013, Angerer beat off challenges from five-time winner Marta of Brazil and American Abby Wambach, the leading goalscorer in international football. Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic won the FIFA Puskas honor, awarded to the scorer of the best goal and voted for by the public, following his stunning overhead strike against England. Meanwhile, legendary Brazilian Pele, rated by many as the best footballer of all time, received FIFA's maiden Prix d'Honneur. The organizers said they were righting a wrong, since Pele - the only man to have won the World Cup three times - had been ineligible to win the Ballon d'Or during his playing days as it was only for Europe-based players at the time. ""I promised to my family that I would not cry but I am emotional,"" said the man who won football's greatest tournament in 1958, 1962 and 1970. ""I got so many trophies and prizes but I was jealous because all of those guys who got the Ballon d'Or, which I couldn't get because I didn't play in Europe. Now I thank God that I can complete my trophies at home."" The FIFA/FIFPro World XI was also unveiled and was dominated by Spain-based players, with six of the side playing in La Liga, with three from Germany and two from France. FIFPro, the world players' union, invited 52,000 of its members to select their team of the year. FIFA/FIFPro World XI: Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany); Dani Alves (Barcelona and Brazil), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid and Spain), Thiago Silva (PSG and Brazil), Lahm (Bayern Munich and Germany); Iniesta (Barcelona and Spain), Xavi (Barcelona and Spain), Franck Ribery (Bayern Munich and France); Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid and Portugal), Messi (Barcelona and Argentina), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Paris Saint-Germain and Sweden). The glittering ceremony - which was hosted by former Dutch international Ruud Gullit and Brazilian model Fernanda Lima - was attended by such footballing luminaries as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo (Brazil), Cafu, UEFA President Michel Platini and France coach Didier Deschamps among others. Yet the night belonged to the Portuguese Ronaldo, who had finished runner-up in the voting for three of the previous four years. Having scored 42 goals so far this season, he made his debut for Sporting Lisbon in 2002 before leaving for Manchester United the following campaign. There he claimed three English Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the European Champions League in 2008, the same year he was first crowned by FIFA as the world's best footballer. Ronaldo swapped Manchester for Madrid for a then world record fee in 2009. Since joining Real, he has been prolific, averaging over a goal a game for the nine-time European champions. Messi, meanwhile, helped Barcelona to the Spanish league title last year, while Ribery was part of the all-conquering Bayern team that triumphed in five different competitions in 2013. In 2010 and 2011, FIFA's World Footballer of the Year prize was fused with the Ballon D'Or award previously handed out by France Football.","Real Madrid's Portuguese player Cristiano Ronaldo named World's best for second time .

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho is under fire from a Muslim leader in Italy after his criticism of Sulley Muntari for fasting during Ramadan. Mourinho was unhappy with the performance of Muntari and his team on Sunday. Ghana midfielder Muntari was taken off after just half an hour of Inter's disappointing 1-1 home draw against Bari as they began their defense of the Serie A title on Sunday. Mourinho pulled no punches in the post match press conference when he implied that the former Portsmouth star had played poorly because he lacked energy due to his fast. ""Muntari had some problems related to Ramadan, perhaps with this heat it's not good for him to be doing this, "" Mourinho told reporters. ""Ramadan has not arrived at the ideal moment for a player to play a football match."" The former Chelsea manager, who is renowned for his outspoken comments, even suggested that Muntari would be dropped for this weekend's derby match against city rivals AC Milan. But his comments were seized on by Mohamed Nour Dachan, president of the union of Islamic communities in Italy. ""I think Mourinho could do with talking a little less,"" he told SKY TV. Dachan said that Muntari would gain mental strength from his Muslim beliefs to help him overcome the handicaps of fasting during daylight hours. ""A player who is a believing Christian, Jew or Muslim is certainly calmer pyschologically and that improves his performance,"" he claimed. Whether Mourinho carries out his threat to drop Muntari is open to questions because Sunday's match in the San Siro kicks off after sundown in Italy, leaving the player some time to rehydrate. Meanwhile, the Egyptian team preparing for the under-20 World Cup in their home country have turned down the chance to break their fast. The country's religious authorities gave the squad members permission to avoid fasting during Ramadan, but the team ignored the instruction. The competition starts just a few days after the end of Ramadan, but the team is in strict training in a bid to claim the prestigious title.","Jose Mourinho in hot water over remarks about midfielder Sulley Muntari .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A massive new terminal at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport is being touted as a testament to India's economic prowess. The sprawling five million square foot building was officially opened Saturday by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi. Complete with imported granite floors, huge white columns fitted with expensive speakers, 63 elevators, 95 immigration counters and a state of the art security and baggage system, Terminal 3 is also home to India's first transit hotel. Officials say the new nine-level hub will be able to handle 34 million passengers per year, making it one of the biggest in the world. ""This is a confirmation that India has truly arrived on the world stage,"" India's Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel told the crowd of invited guests. Terminal 3 is a far cry from the cramped, low tech international terminal that existed before. In addition to its architectural grandeur, the $3 billion building is attempting to be green with high ceilings featuring skylights to save on energy consumption during the day. It was built in just 37 months in anticipation of the Commonwealth Games, which are coming to Delhi in October this year. But the terminal is not without its critics. Some question the amount of money spent on the project, pointing out less than one percent of the population travels by air.","New terminal at Delhi¹s Indira Gandhi International Airport cost $3 billion .

"(CNN) -- Although details are still emerging in this most recent tragedy, we know an officer repeatedly shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old black man, Michael Brown, in a St. Louis suburb last weekend -- less than two days before he was scheduled to attend college. Last month, Eric Garner, another unarmed black man, died from an illegal police chokehold during an encounter on Staten Island, New York. Nearly 20 years ago, my son Anthony Baez also died in an illegal police chokehold. Anthony was playing football in the street with his brother when their ball accidentally hit a police car. Instead of addressing real public safety issues, a New York police officer chose to harass my sons brutally. These cases and many more reveal our country's systemic criminalization and devaluing of black and brown lives. The list is long. Twelve years after Anthony was killed, New York police officers fired at an unarmed Sean Bell 50 times and killed him the night before his wedding. The detectives who were responsible were acquitted of criminal charges. Just three years later, a BART police officer in Oakland, California, shot and killed 22-year-old Oscar Grant while he was facedown on a subway platform, posing no threat. It inspired a movie, ""Fruitville Station."" The transit police officer who shot him was convicted of a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter and spent 11 months in prison. Two years ago, unarmed National Guardsman Noel Polanco was fatally shot by a New York police detective during a highway traffic stop. The detective was not indicted. Also two years ago, unarmed 18-year-old Ramarley Graham was shot and killed by a New York police officer who unlawfully entered his home and killed him in front of his grandmother and 6-year-old brother. A judge threw out the first indictment against Officer Richard Haste, who fatally shot Graham, and a second grand jury failed to re-indict him. Just this January, an off-duty Houston police officer shot and killed 26-year-old Jordan Baker, a father and college student who worked part time, at a strip mall. The investigation is still pending. These are just some of the dozens of police killings of unarmed Americans by law enforcement over the last decades. These tragedies and injustices happen year after year, and people of color -- primarily black and Latino -- are usually the victims. Sadly, our communities in New York and elsewhere are almost conditioned to expect these incidents -- the loss of our children, siblings and spouses to excessive violence by those whose job it is to protect us. New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton's recent comment dismissing that race was a factor in Garner's death is a slap in the face to those of us who've lost our children, and it is part of the problem that allows such unjust killings to continue. In addition to the pain families experience from losing their loved ones, we are also forced to endure additional injustices, when again and again government and the criminal justice system fail to hold officers accountable, and instead the victims are criminalized. Similar to the response in Garner's case, the New York Police Department attempted to blame my son for his death by saying that he and his brother resisted arrest. But what were they under arrest for? Playing football in the street? Even if we hypothetically assumed the officers' allegations were true -- although they were not and a federal court found the officer guilty -- how does that justify killing someone? With Bratton as police commissioner then and today, we see a similar response. In many of these unjust killings, New York police detailed victims' past involvement with the criminal justice system to the media, as if that justified their lives being taken by the police. We've seen it with Garner, and we saw it with Anthony Rosario, Hilton Vega, Patrick Dorismond and many others. Also, district attorneys fail to convene a grand jury or secure a conviction. We must question the closeness of district attorneys to police departments, given their interdependence. In only a handful of these cases, including my son's, the federal government stepped in to provide some limited accountability. In Michael Brown's killing, the FBI will conduct a parallel investigation to one already under way by the St. Louis County, Missouri, police. Like it did with my son, the FBI review will focus on possible civil rights violations in his killing. That is the only way my son got justice -- when the federal government found the police officer who killed my son violated his civil rights. Where is the justice for families like those of Ramarley Graham? It's been two years since his death and a year since the Justice Department said it was reviewing the case but still nothing. The family doesn't even know whether the officer responsible for killing him in cold blood has been disciplined or still walks around with a gun and shield. Those with a badge who unjustly kill and brutalize should be stripped of their badge, their gun, their job and their pension because they have violated the public trust. A systemic lack of accountability and inadequate discipline allows these incidents to continue to happen. And now, in the wake of Garner's death, Bratton and the New York Police Department are responding in the same way they always have -- pledges of more training. It's not training that will prevent this from happening again. We need accountability for all officers involved that sends a message that this type of brutality is unacceptable and the lives of people of color are equally valued. Systemic cultural and substantive policy changes in police departments -- particularly in New York -- are needed to ensure black and brown communities are not targeted with overly aggressive, discriminatory ""broken windows policing"" and ""stop and frisk"" policies that promote brutality and violence. Officers should work to understand the communities they work in, not criminalize them. Police-community relations can only start to improve when individual officers who abuse civilians' rights are held accountable with a zero-tolerance policy for police brutality. Anything less is just rhetoric, and I fear that these unjust deaths will continue with more families and communities suffering the same pain.","Like unarmed Eric Garner, Iris Baez's son was killed by police in an illegal chokehold .

"The world is smaller and people are more mobile than at any time in history. This makes it easier than ever for what's happening anywhere on the globe to harm Americans' health. Here are five ways diseases in other countries pose a threat: . The flu could threaten millions. Even in a mild year for flu, in the United States alone, there are thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and billions of dollars in productivity losses. In a pandemic, millions of people worldwide could be killed. H7N9 influenza, also known as bird flu, is spreading in China, though fortunately it has not mutated to become an infectious disease outbreak that could threaten the health of people around the world. Antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Antibiotic resistance just might be the most urgent health threat facing us now. The nightmare strain of bacteria known as CRE, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, arose abroad and was introduced to one state in the United States. Now it's in at least 44 states. It can resist all or almost all antibiotics, kills many of the people who get it in their blood, and spreads its resistance capabilities to other bacteria. The World Health Organization estimates multidrug-resistant tuberculosis already has infected a half a. million people across the globe. A nightmare health scenario we can stop . Diseases don't respect borders. Going abroad can expose travelers to more than new cultures and once-in-a-lifetime experiences. More than 1,500 U.S. travelers get malaria every year, and the numbers are increasing. Yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes and causes more than 30,000 deaths worldwide each year, primarily in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America. People coming back from safari might bring back more than just pictures; they could find themselves facing African trypanosomiasis, better known as sleeping sickness, transmitted by the tsetse fly found only in rural Africa. ""Foreign"" diseases are now domestic threats.  We think of parasitic diseases as risks to travelers, but they harm people here at home as well.  For example, Chagas disease is a chronic infection generally acquired by people in rural areas of Latin America, but about 300,000 people now living in the United States have this disease. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease common in the tropics that infects more than 60 million people in the United States. While the immune system usually keeps the parasite from making people sick, it can cause death attributed to foodborne illness. Emerging infections: What's the next HIV? Mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, dengue, and chikungunya infect hundreds of thousands of people each year and are spreading globally. In the past few years, we've seen global outbreaks of Ebola and other deadly viral hemorrhagic fevers. 5 health challenges for 2014 . There are many diseases out there that we don't even know about. Our new effort can prevent them from becoming epidemics. That's why CDC partners with nations all over the world to detect and respond to disease outbreaks. Together we responded to more than 250 outbreaks in 2013. No single country can deal with these health threats alone. Cooperation between countries has tremendous impact in early detection. Early detection of a single case of Ebola virus in 2011 led to an immediate response and the disease was stopped in its tracks. Previous similar outbreaks were large and spread rapidly through communities there. CDC is helping countries around the world strengthen their ability to prevent avoidable catastrophes and epidemics, detect threats early, and respond rapidly and effectively. Stopping outbreaks where they occur is the most effective and least expensive way to save lives at home as well as abroad. And it's the right thing to do. That's why we announced Thursday that the United States, through the work of the CDC and the departments of Agriculture, State, and Defense, has committed to cooperate with at least 30 partner countries to better prevent, detect, and effectively respond to infectious disease threats, better protecting at least 4 billion people around the world -- including the United States -- from threats. How to prevent the next pandemic . And we have called on partner countries to work together so that effective prevention, detection, and response are present in every country around the world. This year CDC and the Department of Defense have pledged $40 million to expand to 10 additional countries in addition to the pilot projects in Uganda and Vietnam. President Obama will request an additional $45 million in 2015 to accelerate progress around the world. It's an essential step in strengthening global health security that will protect Americans, strengthen our nation's global partnerships, and increase health security capacity around the world.  Helping other countries makes those countries, and the United States, safer. The most infectious of all infectious diseases .","Millions could die in a worldwide influenza pandemic .

"(CNN) -- What does the United States have in common with Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia? Answer: the death penalty. Together, the four nations killed 82% of the world's confirmed executions that year, according to Amnesty International. The world's most populous nation, China, won't release its execution stats. State-sanctioned killing is a divisive issue for many reasons, not the least of which is an imperfect justice system. At the latest count, 1,369 people have been executed in the U.S. since 1976 and 144 people on death row have been exonerated, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. New York Law School Professor Robert Blecker writes, society kills some of its criminals intentionally ""because they deserve it."" This is a topic worth discussing. That's why we hosted a CNN Google Hangout video conversation about this issue with CNN's Ashleigh Banfield and top legal experts. One of the most amazing death row stories we talked about during Wednesday's hangout surrounded a South Carolina man named Edward Lee Elmore. He was in line to be another death row statistic, although his lawyers say evidence pointed to his possible innocence. In fact, two federal judges wrote in an appellate court opinion that there was ""persuasive evidence"" that South Carolina Law Enforcement Division agents in the case were ""dishonest."" The judges also wrote that the case bore further evidence of ""police ineptitude and deceit."" When he was 23, Elmore -- a mentally disabled African-American handyman -- was arrested in the 1982 rape and murder of an elderly white widow in Greenwood, South Carolina. Elmore had never been convicted before. He insisted all along he was innocent. After an eight-day trial, it took jurors mere hours to find Elmore guilty and deliver a death sentence. During the appeal process, Elmore sat on death row for years, wondering when his time would run out. It looked bleak for him until a group of lawyers took a very close look at the case. Elmore's lawyers said it looked like evidence was planted that made Elmore look guilty. They also said it looked like evidence was hidden that could have helped Elmore. In 2011, a federal appellate court vacated Elmore's conviction, saying his trial lawyer provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. Read the court's opinion . The next year, instead of waiting for the results of a new trial, Elmore took a prosecutor's offer to plead guilty, while being allowed -- as a judge put it -- to ""maintain his innocence."" That's right. Elmore pleaded guilty to regain his freedom. At 53, he would never get back the 30 years he spent in prison. New York Times investigative journalist Raymond Bonner wrote that Elmore's case ""raises nearly all the issues that shape debate about capital punishment: race, mental retardation, a jailhouse informant, DNA testing, bad defense lawyers, prosecutorial misconduct and a strong claim of innocence."" All of the facts will be laid out at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday during the premiere of CNN's Original Series, ""Death Row Stories."" Top legal experts in our hangout included John H. Blume, one of Elmore's lawyers. Hangout participants sent their questions to Blume as well as death row legal expert Robert Blecker and series Executive Producers Alex Gibney and Brad Hebert. Note: An earlier version of this article referred to an editorial that reported a miscalculated percentage of death row exonerations.","Watch a frank discussion with CNN about the death penalty at our Google Hangout .

"China has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Its rapid industrial progress, growing military strength, large population and steadily increasing international influence, are all clear signs that China will have a secure place among the super powers in the near future. The question, raised in a book by journalist Martin Jacques, is not if China will rule the world, but simply when? In the interview below, Jacques argues that in the twenty-first century, China will challenge our perception of what it is to be modern, and the West will be forced to learn from growing eastern powers. In his view, China will become the largest economy in the world within less than two decades. The former Marxism Today editor is a Senior Fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies at Cambridge University, and a Visiting Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing. His bestseller ""When China Rules the World: the End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order,"" was first published in 2009 and has since sold over a quarter of a million copies and been translated into fourteen languages. The Financial Times' Chief business commentator John Gapper interviewed Jacques at Names not Numbers 2014, an event where CNN International was a media partner. An edited version of the interview is below. John Gapper: Your book is called when China rules the world not if, why when? Martin Jacques: Well, who knows what will happen, but I think that China's rise will continue. We are witness to the greatest global economic transformation there's ever been. The result of it will be that China will become, in time, the leading power in the world. But I don't think it's ever going to rule the world, I was taking poetic license with the title! JG: It seems to me that China don't see themselves as a threat or as an inevitable power in the same way we do? MJ: I think that's correct. The Chinese always stress the fact that they are a poor country and that they are responsible for a fifth of the world's population. There's extraordinary unevenness. The only reason they're a large economic power is because they have so many people, so they've got a long way to go. The way that the Chinese conceive of themselves in the world is very different from the western tradition. I imagine that most people think that as China rises it will be a bit like the U.S. in some shape or form in the way that it expresses itself, and I think this is probably wrong. The whole Chinese tradition is very different from this, they never really colonized other areas. We tend to think the way that the West has done things is emblematic of the way everyone else will do it. JG: It's quite difficult then, to see China through a western frame. You're not Chinese how do you get to understand it? And if it's going to have such a huge impact on our lives, how do we get to understand it? MJ: With great difficulty! The difficulty with the western mentality is that for 200 years we've dominated culture, ways of thinking, the economy and military. So we have not really been open to other cultures and ways of thinking, we've thought that progress is about westernization and becoming more like us. And this is a tremendous weakness in western culture in an era when the center of gravity is going somewhere else, and we are going to be in the position where we will need to learn from something else. Now we're confronted with the task of making sense of China and it is going to be extremely difficult. To understand China we need to start by accepting that it is very different from western societies and it will remain very different and only if we understand China in its specificity, can we make sense of it. And in my view it will take the whole of this century -- this is not a short term operation.","It is clear that China is on the way to becoming a super power .

"Israeli Jewish settlers set the entrance of a West Bank mosque on fire and spray-painted the mosque walls with hate messages against Palestinians and Muslims early Wednesday, Palestinian officials said. The attack in the village of Deir Istiya was an apparent response to an incident last week in which Israeli settlers, Palestinians and Israeli forces clashed near the village of Qusra, south of Nablus. ""This is not the first time extreme Jewish Israeli settlers set a mosque on fire in the West Bank village of Deir Istiya and spray-painted hate messages,"" said Ghassan Douglas, a Palestinian Authority official who monitors the activities of settlements and settlers in the West Bank. ""The settlers almost on a daily basis do this to isolated Palestinians and damage their properties."" Douglas said the incident was a so-called ""price tag"" attack --  a term used to describe acts of vandalism by radical Israeli settlers exacting a ""price"" against Palestinian targets or Israeli security forces in response to actions by the Israeli government. The vandals spray-painted the words ""revenge by blood"" and ""Qusra"" in a reference to last week's incident, Douglas said. The past two years have seen an increase in extremist Israeli Jewish settler attacks against Christian and Muslim religious sites, in which churches or mosques have been set alight, and against Palestinian property. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that a ""price tag"" incident had occurred, in which the door to the mosque was damaged and a rug was burned. Graffiti was sprayed on the walls saying ""Arabs out"" and ""regards to Qusra,"" the IDF said. IDF spokesman Peter Lerner condemned the act. ""The incident is deplorable on every level,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Quick: Which U.S. president has authorized wars of various kinds in seven Muslim countries? If you guessed Barack Hussein Obama, you are correct. Many did not think it would turn out this way. Early on in his presidency, on June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a widely anticipated speech in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, which was billed as the start of a ""reset"" with the Islamic world. President George W. Bush was, of course, widely reviled among Muslims for his invasion of Iraq and the prisons at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Many Muslims hoped that the first African-American president, who had opposed the Iraq War as a candidate, would be quite different than his predecessor. In Cairo, Obama declared, ""I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect; and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition."" Crucially, Obama also said in the Cairo speech: ""We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security. Because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women and children. And it is my first duty as President to protect the American people."" Those who listened to the President's speech mostly heard that he was extending an olive branch to the Muslim world and largely ignored the fact that during the same speech he had also made a rather robust defense of the American war on al Qaeda and its allies. A similar dissonance happened a few months later when the President went to Norway to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. The jurors who awarded the prize (and many who voted for him in 2008) seemed to have conflated Obama's opposition to the Iraq war with his presumed opposition to war in general. The President was surely the first recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize to use the opportunity provided by his acceptance speech in Oslo to explain his philosophy of just and necessary wars. At Oslo, Obama said, ""I face the world as it is, and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people. For make no mistake: Evil does exist in the world. A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms. To say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism; it is recognition of history, the imperfections of man, and the limits of reason."" As it turned out, Obama was one of the most militarily aggressive American presidents in decades, authorizing military operations of various kinds in seven Muslim countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen and, now, Syria. The bombing of Syria is the first time the United States has mounted a full-scale war since World War II without any one of the following . -- A U.N. resolution authorizing force. -- As part of a NATO operation. -- An Arab League resolution in favor of military action. -- A specific U.S. congressional authorization for war in another country. -- The invitation of the host country to conduct military operations as we have recently seen in Iraq, where the Iraqi government has been begging for U.S. military intervention. Do the thought experiment where George W. Bush had gone to war in another Middle Eastern country without the cover of a U.N. resolution, or of a NATO operation, or of Arab League approval, or of a specific congressional authorization. The howls of protest from American liberals and the Muslim world would surely have been deafening. Instead there have been no protests. That's partly because of the adept manner with which the Obama administration assembled a Sunni coalition of the willing -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, the UAE and Bahrain â€” to help with the airstrikes. How Obama came to launch strikes in Syria . But it partly must be something to do with the fact that so many of his critics, and even his supporters, regard Obama as some kind of peacenik. In fact his record shows him to be anything but: . Consider that he mandated a threefold increase in the number of American troops in Afghanistan, from 30,000 soldiers at the end of the Bush administration to 90,000, a surge of troops that played a critical role in blunting the Taliban's momentum, which had gathered strength in the final years of Bush's second term. Consider that under Bush there were 48 CIA drone strikes in Pakistan. Under Obama there have been 328, which have killed some two-dozen al Qaeda commanders, according to a count by New America. Consider that under Bush there was only one CIA drone strike in Yemen. Under Obama there have been 99 drone strikes and 15 airstrikes, which have killed more than three-dozen of the group's senior operatives there. Obama is also the first American president to authorize the assassination of a United States citizen, the New Mexico-born al Qaeda operational commander Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in Yemen in a drone strike in 2011. The same year Obama initiated the alliance that overthrew the Libyan dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. Obama has also waged an effective covert war in Somalia against the al Qaeda affiliate based there, Al-Shabaab, whose leader, Ahmed Godane, was killed in a U.S. airstrike earlier this month. And Obama, of course, also authorized the risky U.S. Navy SEAL mission that killed al Qaeda's founder, Osama bin Laden, in 2011 in Abbottabad, a city deep inside Pakistan. This is not the record of someone who is afraid to use American power, as his critics would have it, but rather a president who is comfortable exercising American hard power even in a country like Syria, where he has launched a war without the kinds of specific international or congressional authorizations other presidents have sought since World War II.","Peter Bergen: President Obama has authorized wars in seven Muslim countries .

"On the first pastoral visit of his papacy, Pope Francis shunned protocol and politics on a visit to the tiny island of Lampedusa off the coast of Sicily to pray for refugees and migrants lost at sea. Francis used the visit to criticize what he called ""global indifference"" to the refugee crisis, saying: ""Today no one in the world feels responsible for this; we have lost the sense of fraternal responsibility; we have fallen into the hypocritical attitude of the priest and of the servant of the altar that Jesus speaks about in the parable of the Good Samaritan,"" he said. ""We look upon the brother half dead by the roadside, perhaps we think 'poor guy,' and we continue on our way, it's none of our business; and we feel fine with this. Lampedusa is just 113 kilometers from Tunisia and has been the first point of entry to Europe for more than 200,000 refugees and irregular migrants who have passed through the island since 1999 (UNHCR stat). The Italian coastguard had just rescued a crippled ship with 165 Eritreans on board just hours before the pope's arrival. The pontiff flew to Lampedusa from Rome on Monday morning and immediately boarded a port authority cutter that has been involved in the rescue of more than 30,000 refugees in recent years, according to the Italian Coast Guard. More than 120 fishermen from Lampedusa escorted this vessel to the island's main port. Outside the port, the pope paused to pray at the sight of a deadly 2011 shipwreck before launching a wreath of flowers into the water to commemorate the lives of those lost at sea ""in search of a better life.""  There were also tourist boats, yachts and people on jet skis waving yellow papal flags to greet the pontiff. ""With one short visit, the pope is drawing attention to three main issues; the plight of poor immigrants, problem of human trafficking, the growing gap between rich and poor in the world,"" said the Vatican's media advisor Greg Burke ahead of the visit. ""Pope Francis is showing that when in Christian faith says 'love your neighbor,' they just don't mean the person next door. This tiny island shows the incredible contrast between the global north and south, between the 'haves' of the world and the 'have nots.' It is a great lesson in true charity, many of the immigrants are not even Christians."" On arriving in the port, the pope then met 50 selected migrants including men, women and children who were both Christian and Muslim and listened to their stories about their perilous voyage from North Africa. He was then driven in a makeshift popemobile -- a white open-top Fiat jeep on loan from a Milan family who have a summer house on the island. He was driven through crowds and past a boat graveyard where the hulls of hundreds of migrant boats are stacked alongside piles of foam mattresses and discarded clothing from the boats. The pope then held a mass for 15,000 people under blazing sun at an outdoor sporting center on the island.  Standing at an altar made of the wooden remnants of refugee boats and dressed in purple robes normally reserved for lent and mourning, Pope Francis gave an emotional homily focused on ""global indifference"" to the refugee and irregular migrant problem. Pope Francis made his decision to visit Lampedusa after hearing about the deaths of refugees whose boat capsized off the coast of Sicily in late June. Several of the refugees clung to the fishing nets of a Tunisian-flagged vessel before the fishermen cut the nets loose, sending at least 10 people to their death.  Many of the bodies were never recovered. ""When, a few weeks ago, I heard the news -- which unfortunately has been repeated so many times -- the thought always returns as a thorn in the heart that brings suffering,"" Francis said. ""And then I felt that I ought to come here today to pray, to make a gesture of closeness, but also to reawaken our consciences so that what happened would not be repeated."" Francis then thanked the people of Lampedusa along with the rescue workers, NGOs  and volunteers who man the centers on the island where refugees are taken. He acknowledged the Muslim immigrants who recently arrived on the island and who are beginning to fast for Ramadan, wishing them ""best wishes for abundant spiritual fruits."" But he lashed those who ignored the plight of refugees. ""The culture of well-being, that makes us think of ourselves, that makes us insensitive to the cries of others, that makes us live in soap bubbles, that are beautiful but are nothing, are illusions of futility, of the transient, that brings indifference to others, that brings even the globalization of indifference,"" he said. The pope's words were not likely meant for the people of Lampedusa, who open their hearts and homes to the hoards of refugees who land on their shores each year, but rather to the greater European Union which has struggled with what to do with the influx of migrants and refugees in recent years. Italy and Malta have long pushed for a comprehensive European Union immigration policy to help absorb the influx but France and Germany have resisted implementing such a plan, calling on the southern nations to do a better job patrolling their borders. So far in 2013, more than 8,400 refugees and migrants have landed in Italy and nearby Malta in search of economic improvement and political asylum, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many have been deported back to their countries of origin while others have been given political asylum and are then free to travel through Europe's open-border countries.","Pope Francis shuns protocol and politics by visiting tiny island of Lampedusa .

"(CNN) -- Yemen says al Qaeda was behind a suicide bombing Sunday that killed four South Korean tourists, according to the Daily Yemen Post. The city of Shibam is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The explosion Sunday evening in the city of Shibam also wounded three other tourists, said Hakim Almasmari, editor-in-chief of the English-language newspaper. Almasmari told CNN Monday that Yemen's Interior Ministry is blaming al Qaeda. CNN could not immediately reach the Yemeni government for confirmation. The bomb was very strong and could be heard some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away from the site, in the Al-Qubah district of Shibam, which is in Hadramot province, Almasmari said. The nationalities of the three injured people were not immediately known. The tourists were taking pictures of Shibam at sunset, Almasmari said.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A growing number of Syria's Middle Eastern neighbors, including its closest allies Iran and Hezbollah, are calling on the embattled and defiant Damascus regime to implement reforms. The chorus of foreign criticism and concern comes as opposition demonstrators inside Syria have begun for the first time making public appeals for foreign ""protection."" In an amateur video believed to have been filmed over the weekend in the southern town of Horan, a crowd of dozens of young Syrians clapped and chanted ""the people demand international protection."" In another video, also posted on YouTube this weekend, activsts held up printed signs saying ""we need international protection,"" in English and Arabic. This is a dramatic departure from the position demonstrators staked out during more than five months of protests against the government of Syrian president Bashar al- Assad. Previously, activists rejected the possibility of any foreign military intervention similar to the NATO bombing campaign of Libya. But inside Syria, there are signs that the opposition movement has grown frustrated with the high death toll resulting from a brutal government crackdown. According to the United Nations, more than 2200 people have been killed during the uprising, in addition to mass arrests and allegations of torture by Syrian security forces. In the video recorded in Horan, some Syrians held up signs saying ""Yes to Arab deterrent Forces."" Activists tell CNN, on condition of anonymity to protect from persecution, there is more debate in opposition circles about new measures ranging from requesting a foreign military ""no fly zone"" over Syria to trying to arm protesters with weapons. ""In an unprecedented move over the past several days, Syrians in Syria and abroad have been calling for Syrians to take up arms, or for international military intervention,"" announced a prominent Syrian opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees in Syria, in an e-mailed statement on Monday. ""While we understand the motivation to take up arms or call for military intervention, we specifically reject this position as we find it unacceptable politically, nationally, and ethically,"" the Committees went on to say, arguing that militarization would ""erode the morale superiority"" of the Syrian revolution. As frustrated protesters contemplate alternative options, Turkey and the Arab league have stepped up their criticism of the al-Assad regime. Turkish president Abdullah Gul blasted his Syrian counterpart in remarks that were televised on Sunday, saying that Ankara had ""lost confidence"" in its former ally and trading partner. ""We have reached a point where anything would be too little, too late. We have lost our confidence,"" Gul said. He noted that according to Turkish intelligence reports, at least 17 people had been killed in a single day last Thursday. ""There is no place for totalitarian regimes and one party governments. Clearly, the leaders of these countries will take the initiative or they will be changed by force,"" Gul added. Those sentiments have been echoed in recent days by Turkey's foreign minister as well as by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who suggested that if al-Assad continued his current policy, he would go the way of the dictators who have been overthrown in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. On Saturday, the Arab League publicly called for restraint and an end to the violence in Syria, while also requesting the group's secretary general depart on an urgent mission to Damascus. Syria's ambassador to the League rejected criticism of the Syrian armed forces. According to SANA, Syria's state news agency, Ambassador Youssef Ahmad repeated the government's claim that the protesters were ""armed terrorist groups"" that were ""receiving foreign aid."" Ahmad also insisted that Syria had embarked on a reform process to meet the demands of its citizens. On Sunday, for example, al-Assad announced the creation of a new media law which promised to respect freedom of expression and defend journalists' right to ""analyze and comment on information."" But even al-Assad's closest allies, Iran and the Lebanese shi'ite movement Hezbullah have suggested Damascus needs to do more to meet the demands of the protest movement. In comments published by the semi-official Iranian Student News Agency on Saturday, The Iranian foreign minister repeated Tehran's unwavering support for Damascus, while also urging the Syrian government to be more cautious and patient In its dealings with the citizenry. Meanwhile, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah applauded Syria's support for anti-Israeli resistance movements in Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian Territories. But in a statement published by Hezbollah's Al Manar TV, Nasrallah also appealed for calm in Syria, and warned that ""international pressure"" was delaying much-needed reforms. ""The most important thing is the fact that the Turks, the Iranians and Hezbollah as well as the Arab League are sending a really strong signal that things are very serious in Syria and on the edge of falling apart,"" said Rami Khouri, a widely-read Lebanese columnist and director of the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut. ""The Iranians and Hezbollah are looking at Bashar al-Assad's choices thus far and drawing the same conclusion we are: this guy's panicking and his decisions indicate incompetence and also moodiness which is a hallmark of Assad's reign,"" said Andrew Tabler, author of the soon-to-be-published ""In the Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle with Syria."" ""Their interaction with Assad is probably the same as ours, its paradoxical. He promises not to use live fire and then uses live fire."" ""They [Iran and Hezbollah] are the two closest allies of Syria,"" Khouri added. ""It's an important message of support and also a warning. A warning that if things keep going bad its going to be bad for everyone."" Even Russia, a long-time supplier of weapons to the Damascus regime, appears to be worried. A high-ranking Russian diplomat delivered a letter from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to al-Assad on Monday, the Kremlin announced on its web-site. The Russian envoys appealed for an immediate end to violence from all sides in Syria, while also urging the Syrian government to immediately begin concrete moves towards implementing reforms. Despite the Syrian president's repeated promises to end single-party rule and lift the four-decade long state of emergency in his country, there were widespread reports that the Syrian military was continuing its deadly crackdown on opposition activists. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least five people were killed and more than 60 wounded when Syrian troops stormed the town of Sarmin in the northwest of the country on Monday. CNN's Joe Sterling in Atlanta, Maxim Tkachenko in Moscow, and Nada Husseini in Beirut contributed to this report .","Syria's closest allies are showing concern .

"A meteor streaked through the skies above Russia's Urals region Friday morning before exploding with a flash and boom that shattered glass in buildings and left about 1,000 people hurt, authorities said. Described by NASA as a ""tiny asteroid,"" the meteor's explosion created a blast in central Russia equivalent to 300,000 tons of TNT, the space agency's officials said Friday, adding that the incident was a once-in-100-years event. The injured included more than 200 children. Most of those hurt are in the Chelyabinsk region, though the vast majority of injuries are not thought to be serious. Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet . About 3,000 buildings were damaged -- mostly with broken glass -- as a result of the shock waves caused by the blast, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. Vladimir Stepanov, of the National Center for Emergency Situations at the Russian Interior Ministry, earlier told state media that hospitals, kindergartens and schools were among those affected. About 20,000 emergency response workers were mobilized, RIA Novosti reported. Read more: Saving Earth from asteroids . Amateur video footage showed a bright white streak moving rapidly across the sky, before exploding with an even brighter flash and a deafening bang. The explosion occurred about 9:20 a.m. local time, as many people were out and about. It was captured in vivid images by Russians, many of whom used dash cameras inside their vehicles. Dash cameras are popular in Russia for several reasons including possible disputes over traffic accidents and the corrupt reputations of police in many areas. Drivers install the cameras for their own protection and to document incidents they could be caught in; on Friday, they were able to document a spectacular natural phenomenon. CNN iReporter and Instagram user Max Chuykov saw the meteor trail from the city of Yekaterinburg. He shared on Instagram that it was ""close to the ground."" Witness Ekaterina Shlygina posted to CNN iReport and wrote on Instagram: ""Upon Chelyabinsk a huge fireball has exploded. It wasn't an aircraft."" The national space agency, Roscosmos, said scientists believed one meteoroid had entered the atmosphere, where it burned and disintegrated into fragments. Read more: When the Quadrantid meteor shower hit its peak . The resulting meteorites are believed to be scattered across three regions of Russia, one of them Chelyabinsk, as well as neighboring Kazakhstan, the news agency said. One large chunk was discovered in a lake in the Chelyabinsk region, RIA Novosti cited the Chelyabinsk governor as saying. A spokesman for the Emergency Ministry for the Chelyabinsk region told CNN earlier Friday that 524 people there were injured and 34 hospitalized. NASA estimates 4,700 'potentially hazardous' asteroids . For sky watchers, the reports bring to mind the famous Tunguska event of 1908 in remote Siberia, in which an asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded, leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. About 80 million trees were felled, radiating out from the center of the blast, but no crater was left. Friday's Chelyabinsk meteor came on the same day that a hefty asteroid charged past Earth. An asteroid makes a close call. Fear not, scientists say . Known as 2012 DA14, the asteroid is thought to be 45 meters long, about half the length of a football field. But scientists say it came not much closer than 17,100 miles from our planet's surface. Officials from around the world were quick to call for greater vigilance in monitoring meteors. ""Today's event is a strong reminder of why we need continuous efforts to survey and identify near-Earth objects,"" said Thomas Reiter, European Space Agency's Director of Human Spaceflight and Operations. Deep Space Industries, a recently created space exploration company, said countries should be proactive in establishing ""a sentry line of spacecraft circling the Earth to intercept and evaluate incoming threats."" ""The hundreds of people injured in northern Russia show it's time to take action and no longer be passive about these threats,"" said Rick Tumlinson, chairman of Deep Space Industries. Your photos: Orionid meteor shower . NASA spokesman Steve Cole told CNN that scientists had determined that the Russian meteor was on a very different trajectory from the larger asteroid. ""They are completely unrelated objects -- it's a strange coincidence they are happening at the same time,"" said Don Yeomans, manager of the Near-Earth Object Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Asteroid and meteor: Connected? ""This kind of object does fall fairly frequently, but when they fall into the ocean or desert, there is no impact on people -- so this one is unusual in the sense that it's come over a populated area,"" Yeomans said. Cole said he wasn't aware whether scientists had foreseen the meteor's entry into the atmosphere. Because meteoroids are small, they are hard to spot and there is often little warning that they are heading toward Earth, he said.

"The rollout of the Affordable Care Act has been unquestionably rocky, but the rush to judgment was over the top. Critics had their knives out even though little data are available on initial program enrollment and success. It's much too early to declare the program either a failure or a success. Commentators who claim certainty need to be more humble in recognizing how little we know yet and more patient until we know more. All the focus on the website problems obscured those benefits the ACA has already created since its passage in 2010. More than 3 million young adults have gained insurance coverage after family coverage was extended through age 26. Since the law passed, closing Medicare's ""doughnut hole"" allowed more than 7 million seniors and disabled people to save an average of $1,200 per person on prescription drugs. Consumers have saved about $5 billion over the past two years through requirements that insurers spend at least 80% of the premium dollar on care for patients. And 71 million Americans with private insurance, as well as 25 million enrollees in Medicare, have gained coverage for at least one free preventive service. The years since the ACA was passed have been marked by the slowest three-year period of health care cost growth on record.  The ACA doesn't bear full credit for this slowdown, particularly given the weak economy.  But the fact that the slowdown has persisted even as the economy has improved, and the fact that costs have grown more slowly even within the Medicare program whose enrollees are largely protected from economic shocks, suggests that the ACA is playing some role in this historic slowdown. The early success stories have been ignored in all the attention paid to the implementation problems.  The premiums offered on the exchanges cost 16% less than what the Congressional Budget Office projected them to be.  This results in significantly lower costs to people and saves almost $200 billion in the federal government budget. Of course, the biggest changes to our system took place New Year's Day. But it is simply too early to judge their impact. For example, when Massachusetts piloted the approach embodied in the ACA, we had very slow enrollment, with only 123 paying customers signing up the first month our subsidized insurance was available. There was a rush of enrollment right before the individual mandate kicked in, and ultimately over three years the program covered about two-thirds of the state's uninsured citizens, leaving Massachusetts with a 3% uninsured rate, the lowest in the nation. So, when will we be able to draw conclusions?  The first date to focus on is March 31, when we can measure how many people enrolled in private and public insurance. Yet what matters more than total enrollment is the health mix of enrollees, relative to what insurers expected when they provided their lower-than-expected insurance bids. We won't really know about this health mix until the end of May, when insurers release their rates for 2015. I expect that we will see only moderate increases in insurance rates at that point, as the federal government has created risk-sharing programs that should mitigate any ""rate shock"" to the market.  But we won't know for sure until we see the rates. The next key time to check success will be the fall of 2014, when the government releases its initial figures on the changes in insurance coverage. Although many have made bold claims about how this law will impact coverage by private and public insurance, we simply won't know until we see the data from our major household surveys of insurance coverage, available in the fall of 2014.  Ultimately, the projections of the Congressional Budget Office suggest that the ACA will not be fully implemented for three years, the amount of time it took to ramp up to full implementation in Massachusetts. So we won't be able to draw final and firm conclusions until late in 2016. This timetable might seem long, but a change as large as the ACA takes time. We must be patient in evaluating that change. Once the data come in, and enough time for the law to be fully implemented has passed,  we can truly draw conclusions about this signature episode in the history of U.S. social policy.","Jonathan Gruber: It's way too early to declare the Affordable Care Act a failure or a success.

"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has something to say to people contemplating illegal migration to the United States: ""We'll send you back."" Deportations will begin this week, he said. It's a message the Obama administration wants to amplify more loudly now that it is wrestling with a huge influx of minors crossing the southern border --  57,000 in the past nine months. They're from troubled Central American countries and a lot are unaccompanied and many of those are young children. It's all overwhelming already stressed immigration services as more and more kids find themselves caught in a bureaucratic limbo and a political firestorm. Reforming an immigration system most in and out of Washington agree is broken is an all-but dead legislative issue in Congress now with midterm elections around the corner. But there is growing pressure on both to address the current influx of minors. Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to fortify the border patrol and strengthen other programs for dealing with those crossing into the United States illegally. But the Republican-led House is not expected to move fast on it and doesn't want to give Obama everything he wants. Some say tweaking a 2008 law combating immigrant trafficking might be enough to stem the flow. Overwhelmed facilities . The political wrangling is all going on as new arrivals make their way to detention facilities like the one Johnson visited in Artesia, New Mexico. It currently houses about 400 immigrants, with more expected to arrive Friday night. The White House has called the situation a ""humanitarian crisis."" Republicans prefer to call it one of the Obama administration's making, and blame it for not being prepared and for an underwhelming response. They liken it to the debacle associated with the underwhelming federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 that was a nadir for Obama's Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. But the administration says the influx was unexpected and that inaction by the Republican-led House on a bipartisan immigration reform plan approved by Senate has held up improvements that could be applied in this case. Obama himself resisted calls, predominantly from Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other Republicans, to visit the border during a trip to the Lone Star State this week. He declined, saying that he was working on the problem and wasn't interested in ""photo ops."" 7 questions on immigration . Johnson, instead, showed up and delivered Obama's message. ""Our message to those who are coming here illegally, to those who are contemplating coming here illegally: 'We will send you back,'"" Johnson said. ""People in Central America should see and will see that if they make this journey and spend several thousand dollars to do that we will send them back and they will have wasted their money,"" he added. The New Mexico facility visited by Johnson opened June 27 at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. It's capable of housing 700 people, and is being used now for adults and children who arrive as family units.  They are subject to ""expedited removal."" The vexing problem involves unaccompanied children, who have arrived in unprecedented numbers this year from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Many are fleeing violence and other hardships. But others, especially Republicans, tie the influx to Obama's 2012 decision to ease deportations for children already in the country illegally. Johnson said his agency is working to dispell ""misinformation"" by smugglers that the United States is giving a ""free pass"" to migrants. ""I think it's fair to say that a good number of (the migrants at the Artesia facility) were surprised that they were being detained,"" Johnson said. ""I think that they expected to be apprehended and simply let go into the interior and they're surprised they're being detained and they're being send back so quickly."" The White House is promising due process, but Obama said on Wednesday that most would likely go back. Obama did meet with those hecklers .

"(CNN) -- As Apple enthusiasts speculate over why pancreatic cancer survivor Steve Jobs won't appear at Macworld Conference & Expo this year, the CEO asks them to think differently about his health. Apple CEO Steve Jobs delivered keynote addresses in September 2008, left, and in October 2005, right. Addressing the ""Apple Community"" in a statement, Jobs said his doctors think they have found the reason behind his weight loss: ""a hormone imbalance that has been 'robbing' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy. Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis."" But doctors unaffiliated with Jobs' care say this ""hormone imbalance"" could be a symptom of a slew of underlying conditions, including cancer or diabetes. However, any diagnosis based on this description and Jobs' cancer history is purely speculative, experts say. Based on Jobs' history of gastrointestinal problems, it's possible his gastrointestinal system either isn't absorbing proteins or is losing proteins, said Dr. Kenneth Burman, director of Endocrinology at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, who is not involved in caring for Jobs. ""I suspect he's referring to his gastrointestinal system and some of the hormones related to that, rather than more classic endocrine hormones,"" which are associated with the thyroid, adrenal or pituitary glands, Burman said. While abnormalities related to those hormones may also lead to weight loss, they are not necessarily associated with pancreatic disease, he said. There is not enough information available to say how severe a gastrointestinal hormonal problem would be, he said. Others speculate the hormonal issue could relate to his cancer. Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, clinical professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said a tumor in the pancreas would typically create an overproduction of hormones. Glucagon, a hormone produced in the pancreas, would lead to weight loss if produced in excess. ""In a patient whom a few years ago had pancreatic cancer, then progressive weight loss, then develops complications from the weight loss, it would be logical to associate his symptoms now with the previous cancer,"" he said. But the weight loss is not necessarily cancer-related, and Jobs' statement suggests that it's not, said Dr. Andrew Lowy, chief of the division of surgical oncology at the University of California, San Diego's Moores Cancer Center. Plenty of hormonal conditions, as well as diabetes related to cancer treatment, could be the reason, he said. Jobs, who co-founded Apple Inc., first learned he had pancreatic cancer in October 2003. He had been getting abdominal scans because of a history of intestinal problems, and a tumor appeared on one of them, Fortune reported last year. The growth was an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer that is operable, Fortune reported. While Jobs initially wanted to treat the tumor with a special diet and alternative therapies, he finally underwent a Whipple procedure, a painful but relatively safe operation, in July 2004, Fortune reported. If Jobs had a recurrence of this tumor, and it was a functional neuroendocrine tumor, which produces problem-causing hormones, that would be one speculative explanation, Lowy said. But not enough information is available to say whether the tumor was the functional kind, he said. ""Is it possible that a cancer recurrence would result in weight loss? Of course. He's saying that's not what he has, and so, I have to take him at his word. None of us know the truth except his doctors,"" Lowy said. Rumors about Jobs' declining health have been circulating for months, as his weight visibly dropped from one public appearance to the next. While Jobs' keynote address at the Macworld Conference & Expo is usually the highlight of the Apple fan gathering, Apple announced in December Jobs would not appear this year and the company would no longer participate in the event after 2009. CNN's Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.","Doctors: Jobs' ""hormone imbalance"" could refer to several health conditions .

"Remee Lee was elated when she became pregnant, but those feelings quickly turned into a nightmare that won't let go of her. Her boyfriend wasn't happy about the pregnancy, but it was Lee's dream to have a child. Until her boyfriend, John Andrew Welden, took that dream away. This week, Welden, 28, pleaded guilty to killing their unborn baby. How? He tricked Lee into taking an abortion pill, causing her to miscarry. ""Every day is a nightmare for me ever since this began,"" Lee told  Chris Cuomo on CNN's 'New Day' Tuesday. ""Even hearing the guilty (plea) yesterday, it's hard to believe it, it's hard to read it and know that this actually happened to me."" Guilty plea can't take away pain . Lee, 26, was in the Florida courtroom Monday, dabbing away tears as her former boyfriend accepted a plea deal that could send him to prison for at least 13 years. Follow the conversation with Chris Cuomo . Welden was indicted under the rarely used federal Unborn Victims of Violence Act, a murder charge that carries a life sentence. Todd Foster, Welden's defense attorney, told reporters that the stakes of going to trial were too high. ""The possibility of a mandatory life sentence, no discretion to the judge, obviously is a big factor,"" Foster said. ""Obviously it's tragic all around from every angle, and I think that's recognized."" Those who know Lee say she's still burdened by sadness. ""Nothing is going to bring back what was taken from her,"" Lee's attorney Gil Sanchez said. She trusted him . Lee has said she was madly in love with Welden when she suspected she was pregnant. They went together for a sonogram at Welden's father's Tampa-area clinic. The test showed she was six weeks pregnant. Despite her boyfriend's reluctance, Lee planned to have the baby. Days later, Welden told Lee that her blood tests had shown that she had an infection and needed to take amoxicillin. But instead of the antibiotic, Welden brought her Cytotec, a drug that causes contractions. Welden told her to take three pills a day. She trusted him. After she took only one pill, Lee was rushed to the hospital with abdominal pain and bleeding. She lost the baby. When doctors inspected the pills, it was discovered that they were not antibiotics, but abortion pills. ""There's just no words for the horror I wake up with every day that this is my reality. There's no escaping it, there's no turning it off,"" Lee said. Welden said nothing as he left the courtroom Monday. Surrounded by security, he silently walked by a group of reporters, got into a black Hummer and was driven away. Welden is scheduled to be sentenced December 5.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The 1997 murder of Christopher Wallace, the rapper also known as The Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls, remains an unsolved crime despite Los Angeles police and FBI investigations that lasted for years. The FBI, which joined the case five years after the shooting, opened up its files this week by publishing hundreds of pages of investigation reports and notes from its probe on the agencies website. Readers get a behind-the-scenes look at the FBI and LAPD's work, but the documents are heavily redacted, hiding the names of sources, investigators and suspects. The drive-by shooting, in front of dozens of witnesses who were leaving a music industry party in Los Angeles on March 9, 1997, spurred several conspiracy theories, but no arrests. Smalls, 24, was killed six months after his former friend and rap rival Tupac Shakur was gunned down on a Las Vegas street, causing suspicion that both shootings were part of an ""East Coast versus West Coast"" hip hop war. Shakur recorded for Marion ""Suge"" Knight's Los Angeles-based Death Row Records, while Smalls was signed with New York-based Bad Boy Entertainment, founded by Sean ""Puffy"" Combs. The FBI opened its case in December 2002 because of ""multiple source information"" that Smalls was killed ""in retaliation for the murder of Tupac Shakur"" and that a rogue LAPD officer was involved, an FBI report said. The FBI's case was closed in January 2005 when the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles decided there was enough evidence for indictments in the case, according to one letter in the files. The files include a Los Angeles Times newspaper story that suggested the FBI was pressured by the city of Los Angeles to drop its probe after the lead FBI investigator was named as a witness in a $400 million lawsuit Smalls' mother filed against the city. Smalls' mother and his estate claimed that an LAPD officer, who was later convicted of bank robbery, was involved and that the police department was ignoring evidence. The lawsuit was later dismissed. The newly-published documents, despite the redactions, do indicate tension between the FBI and LAPD. Near the end of the FBI probe, the lead agent writes that he had been ordered to have no contact with the civil lawyers for the Smalls family. The agent notes in one report that he would not contact a certain source ""because he/she is one of the main witnesses"" in the civil suit against the LAPD. Retired Los Angeles Police Detective Russell Poole, who worked on the Smalls' case, told CNN earlier this year that he believes Suge Knight was behind the murder, even though the Death Row Records' boss was serving time on a probation violation at the time. ""Suge Knight ordered the hit,"" Poole says, adding that he believes it was arranged by Reggie Wright Jr., who headed security for Death Row Records. Poole goes even further, stating that he believes Knight was behind the shooting of Tupac Shakur as well. Poole says Shakur's bodyguards told him that the rapper planned to sever ties with Knight's Death Row Records which could have cost the company millions of dollars. ""That theory doesn't even add up,"" says Cathy Scott, who wrote ""The Killing of Tupac Shakur,"" noting that Knight was sitting in the driver's seat next to the rapper. ""Open fire on my car, but try not to hit me?"" Reggie Wright Jr. told CNN he had nothing to do with either murder, and Suge Knight has repeatedly said he had nothing to do with the crime. But two months after Shakur's killing, Knight talked to ABC News and one quote seems to follow the former record company executive: ""If you knew who killed Tupac, would you tell police?"" To which Knight responded: ""Absolutely not. It's not my job. I don't get paid to solve homicides. I don't get paid to tell on people.""

"SEMEY, Kazakhstan (CNN) -- Kazakhstan's nuclear orphans are a distressing sight. This young child slept at an orphanage, his deformities the result of nuclear testing in the region. The first child I met in the local orphanage was lying limply in his crib. His giant, pale head was perched on his tiny shoulders, covered in bed sores, like a grotesquely painted paper-mâché mask. Peering out, a pair of tiny black eyes darted around. It took me a few seconds to understand what I was seeing. The doctor told me he was 4 years old. Through the bars in the next crib, I saw another child, twisted with deformities. His fragile legs and arms turned in impossible contortions. These are the children of Kazakhstan's terrifying nuclear past. Decades of Soviet nuclear testing unleashed a plague of birth defects. When the Soviet Union tested its nuclear devices, it chose eastern Kazakhstan, one of its remotest, most desolate areas. But no one bothered to evacuate the people living there.  Watch the effects of nuclear bombs on villagers » . The testing began in 1949 at a site known as Polygon and continued until 1989. According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, there were 456 tests, including 116 nuclear bombs tested above ground. The Polygon site officially closed on August 29, 1991 -- 16 years ago this week. Local officials say there were hundreds of thousands of people, possibly as many as a million, who lived in the region during the nuclear testing. The end of the Cold War might have ended this dark chapter, but thousands are still paying a terrible price.  Learn more about nuclear testing » . From the old Soviet city of Semipalatinsk, now renamed Semey, it was a long grueling drive across the barren, flat Kazakh plain. Nature can be hostile here, with temperatures hitting over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in summer, then plunging to 40 below in winter. The people living in the villages scattered throughout this former nuclear testing zone have been through the unspeakable. Seriqkaisha is 62 years old. She remembers watching the mushroom clouds as a child. ""We were very frightened,"" she told me, ""because the windows in our house would blow out and the walls would shake. My parents both died of cancer, and my own son is handicapped."" Almost every family in Seriqkaisha's village, 20 miles from the old test site, is affected -- from cancers to impotency to birth defects and other deformities.  See where the nuclear site is located » . Meeting people was proving hard. The genetic defections and illnesses that afflict so many here are frequently a source of shame. The doctor told me that people hide their deformed family members from outsiders. For decades, they have felt like animals in a zoo, she said, and had grown to distrust prying eyes. The region also has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, according to local health officials. Tragically, many young men who discover they are impotent -- one of the effects of nuclear fallout -- end their own lives. A doctor introduced me to Biken -- one of the few residents who agreed to be interviewed. She was born in 1951, two years after the nuclear testing began. Her facial disfigurement, she said, has always brought her despair. ""If only there had been no bombs, I could have been equal to every one else. My youngest daughter looks like me too. I worry about her future, more than anything,"" Biken said. It was heartbreaking to hear. The problem of defects is so big, there's even a museum of mutations at the regional medical institute back in Semey, the largest city near the old nuclear testing site. It's a small room filled with jars containing deformed fetuses and human organs preserved in formaldehyde. It's hard to look at them -- babies with bulging eyes and malformed brains, or conjoined twins locked in a contorted embrace. The head of the institute, Tolebae Rakhipbekov, showed me around and told me how this house was more than just a grim collection of anomalies. It was the reality for some parents, and a real fear for everyone who lives here. ""You could call these children, and others affected, victims of the Cold War. Kazakhstan has refused nuclear ambitions now because it experienced 40 years of this war. Nowhere else were there so many nuclear tests,"" Rakhhipbekov said. And nowhere else, I suppose, are so many Cold War injustices still being felt. E-mail to a friend .","Thousands in Kazakhstan remain scarred from decades of nuclear tests .

"It's that time again: Lunar New Year. Red packets of money will change hands and dragon dances will roar through the streets as people around the world, predominately of Chinese descent, usher in the Year of the Horse. Beyond the usual Lunar New Year traditions, however, is a holiday full of interesting quirks and customs. 1. Locals don't call it Chinese New Year . In China, the festivities are known as spring festival (春節) or Lunar New Year (農曆新年) -- the new year is determined by the lunar calendar. And the Chinese aren't the only ones who observe it. From late January to mid-February, Korea, Vietnam and other countries celebrate Lunar New Year. 2. Traffic is chaos . Lunar New Year is basically like having an entire country throw a family reunion -- all at once. Traffic Armageddon inevitably strikes. In China, the Spring Festival travel rush period (chunyun) is the country's, if not the world's, biggest season of human migration. Whether pushing their way into packed buses, buying black-market tickets from scalpers or standing for hours on a crowded train, travelers do whatever it takes to see loved ones. With commuters and migrant workers returning home, the government expects 3.62 billion journeys to take place this year, according to Xinhua news. In Korea last year, nearly 30 million people visited their hometowns by car, bus, train or plane, according to the Korea Expressway Corporation. 3. It's not just one day . Lunar New Year lasts 15 days, starting from January 31, 2014. This year its last day falls on Valentine's Day. It's an action-packed holiday -- you can bet on horse races, watch parades, bargain in bazaars and fight for prime worship spot at the temple. 4. It's a season of superstitions . During LNY, you live like a college student on the first day -- which means no showers, laundry or cleaning. Above all, there's no taking out the trash -- doing so is said to wash away your luck and prosperity. You hang out with family (especially in-laws) on the second day, which is considered the beginning of the year. On the third day, visiting friends and family is frowned upon, because it's a day prone to arguments. On the seventh day, it's time to party in celebration of everyone's birthday. 5. You can rent a boyfriend . Lunar New Year can be rough for singles, especially females. Many family reunions are highlighted by dreaded interrogations of singles who haven't settled down. Now there's a solution -- boyfriend rentals. China's largest online retailer, Taobao, has a section for fake boyfriend rentals, so parents and relatives can finally stop nagging. Renting a bogus marriage prospect ranges from RMB 500 ($82) to 8,000 ($1,321) per day. The package comes with ""a free embrace, hand holding and a goodbye kiss on the cheek,"" as well as a list of additional specific service charges. According to People's Daily, dinner costs RMB 50 ($8) an hour and a trip to the movies is RMB 30 ($5) -- double if it's a thriller. 6. Odd linguistic customs are observed . In Parts of China, there are a few things you can and can't do over the Lunar New Year holiday -- simply because of how they sound. Footwear purchases are off limits for the entire lunar month, as the term for shoes (haai) sounds like losing and sighing in Cantonese. You can however, turn the Chinese character for luck (fu) upside down to make ""dao"" (which sounds like arrival) and put it on your door to bring in good fortune for the new year. 7. Firecrackers are for scaring away monsters . Legend says the half-dragon, half-lion monster ""Nian"" comes out of hiding and attacks people (especially children) during the Lunar New Year. His weakness? Sensitive ears. In the old days, people would light bamboo stalks on fire to frighten the monster. Nowadays, you can watch spectacular fireworks display along the Hong Kong waterfront or play with firecrackers in a Beijing hutong. 8. Red undies are critical for some . Red is associated with luck and prosperity, but it's used mainly for protective purposes. In addition to being spooked by loud noises, ""Nian"" is frightened by the color red, which explains all the red you see on Lunar New Year decorations. For those born in the Year of the Horse -- turning 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 this year -- red undergarments are a must. Not because that pesky LNY monster has X-ray vision, but because red undies supposedly fend off misfortune in this unlucky year. Interestingly, the Cantonese term for pants (fu) sounds exactly like the word for wealth. 9. It's a time for sweets . Food is central to all Chinese festivals, but sugary snacks are especially important for LNY, since they sweeten up prospects for the coming year. Traditional holiday treats include nian gao (rice pudding), babaofan (eight treasure rice), jau goks (crispy dumplings), candied fruits and seeds. 10. It has its own movie genre . China and Hong Kong have a film genre called ""hesuipian"" devoted to Lunar New Year. The films are usually illogical, uplifting comedies, with a focus on families and happy endings to make viewers feel warm and fuzzy. Similar to Christmas movies, really. Holiday favorites include the ""All's Well, Ends Well"" series (the 1992 classic stars Stephen Chow and Maggie Cheung), ""Fat Choi Spirit"" and ""It's a Mad Mad World."" 11. Customs are flexible . Customs and superstitions aren't set in stone. There's room for flexibility in interpretation and application. Banning shoes for the entire lunar month? That depends on how you read the rules -- the word for shoe might sound like sighing, but it also sounds like harmony (hexie). Not showering for the sake of Lunar New Year? Many pass on that for obvious hygienic reasons. In the end, Lunar New Year is really about having a great time with family and friends, so many opt not to sweat the details.","Chinese government expects 3.62 billion people to travel during Lunar New Year .

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma civil rights activist and educator Clara Luper -- was best known for organizing a 1958 sit-in at a segregated Katz Drug Store in downtown Oklahoma City -- died Wednesday night at her home in Oklahoma City. She was 88. Luper, who was celebrated as a pioneer of civil rights in Oklahoma, organzied a protest that lasted several days and ultimately resulted in the integration of 38 Katz Drug Stores in Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas and Iowa. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett requested that all flags on city property to be flown at half staff in honor of Luper and her contribution to the city. In a statement issued from his office, Cornett described Luper as a ""great Oklahoman and a great American."" ""While her accomplishments are too many to list, her legacy is easily defined,"" Cornett said in the statement. ""She made Oklahoma and the United States of America a better place to live and was a shining example of the distinctly American idea that while we might hail from many cultures, we are one people."" Throughout the 1960s, Luper worked with the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to stage sit-ins and non-violent protests which ultimately led to the desegregation of restaurants in Oklahoma City. In an interview with CNN affiliate KWTV, Luper's son, Calvin, said his mother was surrounded by family at the time of her death. He added, though she's known for organizing the single sit-in, his mother was dedicated to making the life of citizens in Oklahoma better. ""Now we have to step up to the plate and accept the responsibility and do what Mom wanted us to do, and that would be to carry on her legacy of honesty and do anything else that would make our city and state a great place."" Luper is survived by her two daughters, a son and grandchildren.","Clara Luper died Wednesday at 88 .
