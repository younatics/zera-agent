"Five cups of coffee a day may keep the doctor away, according to a new government health report. A panel of experts from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which convenes every five years, did a detailed assessment of the caffeinated beverage for the first time. They concluded that a trusty cup of Joe could have various health benefits, including reduced  risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's and liver cancer. Drink up! Five cups of coffee a day may keep the doctor away, according to a new government health report . The amount the report recommends drinking is three to five cups a day, while pregnant women should limit their intake to two cups a day. There was found to be no added benefit from exceeding these limits. Americanos appear to be the way to go, as the panel note that high-calorie creams, milks and sugars could diminish the potential positive health effects. The report concludes that moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy lifestyle. Although, individuals who do not consume java should not start consuming it for health benefits alone. Tom Brenna, a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and a nutritionist at Cornell University, said the findings put a new spin on coffee, which has traditionally been panned by health experts. 'Coffee’s good stuff,' he told Bloomberg, adding: 'I don’t want to get into implying coffee cures cancer - nobody thinks that. 'But there is no evidence for increased risk, if anything, the other way around.' The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee helps the U.S. government formulate dietary guidelines that affect millions of American diets, from school lunches to food package labels. The U.S. is the one world’s biggest consumers of coffee. According to a 2014 survey by National Coffee Association, 61per cent of Americans sip on a cup of the good stuff each day. Despite the focus on coffee, the Dietary Guidelines A . dvisory Committee's latest report sticks to the basic message of the previous guidelines in 2010: Eat more fruits and vegetables and whole grains; eat less saturated fats, salt and sugar. The 2015 dietary guidelines are set to be issued by the end of the year. EGGS ARE OK . The report says dietary cholesterol now is 'not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.' This follows increasing medical research showing the amount of cholesterol in your bloodstream is more complicated than once thought. The committee says available evidence 'shows no appreciable relationship' between heart disease and how much dietary cholesterol you eat, but it still recommends eating less saturated fat. As in previous years, the report advises limiting saturated fats to 10 percent of total calories. The panel doesn't give a specific recommendation for how much cholesterol - or eggs - a person may eat. WATCH THE ADDED SUGAR . Added sugars should be around 200 calories a day - about the amount in one 16-ounce sugary drink, says the advisory committee, which is made up of doctors and nutritionists. The recommendation is part of a larger push in recent years to help consumers isolate added sugars from naturally occurring ones like those in fruit and milk. Added sugars generally add empty calories to the diet. Americans now get about 13 per cent of their calories from added sugar, or 268 calories a day, the committee says. Older children, adolescents and young adults generally take in more. The committee recommends ten per cent, which is 'a target within reach,' says Miriam Nelson, a Tufts University professor of nutrition who served on the panel. Sugary drinks should be replaced with water instead of those with low-calorie sweeteners; there's not enough evidence those drinks can help with weight loss, the committee advises. A SOFTER APPROACH ON SALT . Sodium adds up quickly. A turkey sandwich and a cup of soup can average about 2,200 milligrams. That's just under the committee's recommendation of 2,300 milligrams a day for all people, even those most at risk for heart disease. The 2010 dietary guidelines had recommended those at risk for heart disease limit sodium to 1,500 milligrams. The new report said lowering to that amount can still be helpful for some. But the new advice follows a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine that said there is no good evidence that eating less than 2,300 milligrams a day of sodium offers benefits. With the average American eating more than 3,400 milligrams daily, the panel recommends at least trying to reduce sodium intake by 1,000 milligrams a day if the goals are unattainable. Alice Lichtenstein, a member of the panel and a professor at Tufts University, said the new recommendation 'puts the focus where it should be.' Get sodium intake down, and fine-tune the numbers as more evidence comes in. EAT A PLANT-BASED DIET . The panel recommends eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. A plant-based diet is 'more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact' than the current U.S. diet, which is high in meat. The report stops short of telling people not to eat meat, saying 'no food groups need to be eliminated completely to improve sustainability outcomes.' Overall, the panel advises a diet lower in red and processed meat, and in a footnote says lean meats can be part of a healthy diet. The North American Meat Institute criticized the report, saying the health benefits of lean meat should be 'a headline, not a footnote.' The meat recommendations in particular may prompt pushback from Capitol Hill. Last year, Congress noted the panel's interest in the environment and directed Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack 'to only include nutrition and dietary information, not extraneous factors' in final guidelines.","A panel of experts from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which convenes every five years, did a detailed assessment of the caffeinated beverage for the first time .

"Three Bronze Age shrines that may have been used to predict the future have been discovered in a hilltop fortress at Gegharot, Armenia. Each of the 3,300-year-old shrines is made up of a single room holding a clay bowl filled with smaller ash and ceramic artefacts. Researchers suspect that, as part of an ancient ritual, local rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances. Three Bronze Age shrines that may have been used to predict the future have been discovered in a hilltop fortress at Gegharot, Armenia. The basin of the east citadel shrine is seen in this image. In the three shrines archaeologists found evidence that animal bones, stone and flour . 'Our best evidence of this comes from pollen washes,' Professor Adam Smith from Cornell University told Dailymail.com. 'We take the pottery and wash with distilled water. We then capture the run off. From this we found residues of grape, and something similar to Ephedra which is a stimulant.' The shrine artefacts include clay idols, animal bones, stamp seals and containers used to burn substances, according to a report by Owen Jarus in LiveScience. Archaeologists at Cornell University believe local rules used the knucklebones of cows, sheep and goat as a type of dice to predict the future. These bones were marked with burns and other engravings, and were small enough to roll. In one shrine, researchers found 18 pebbles. 'These stones appear to have been selected for their smooth, rounded shape and their colour palette, which ranged from black and dark grey to white, green and red,' writes Professor Adam Smith, lead author of the study at Cornell University. Researchers suspect that, as part of an ancient ritual, local rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances. The altar and basin of a shrine (the large, fractured block) excavated on the fortress' east citadel can be seen in these two images . Researchers suspect that, as part of an ancient ritual, local rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances. Pictured is one of the shrines . On the left is a clay idol with hornlike protrusions, while the right image shows what is considered another idol . But how exactly these unmarked stones would have been used in rituals is unknown. Professor Smith suspects they may have been used in the same way as the knuckle bones. Another shrine contained vessels used to grind flour. It may have been used to predict the future in a ritual called aleuromancy. The Bronze Age in the Caucasus region can be divided into two parts - the Middle Bronze Age from around 2,500 to 1500BC, and the Late Bronze Age from 1500 down to 900 BC. The earlier part is famous for its rich burials from localised cultures. In the later Bronze Age a far more homogenous culture came into being. The Late Bronze Age also saw an increase in the number of hillforts sites. These had begun in the Middle Bronze Age and reached their peak in the early Iron Age. Aleuromancy was a practice in which messages would be baked inside of cakes or cookies, which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told. 'What is conspicuous about the grinding installation in the east citadel shrine is the lack of a formal oven for bread baking,' Professor Smith writes. The shrine's basin 'was clearly used for burning materials and certainly could have been used to bake small balls of dough, but it is unlikely that it would have been used to cook loaves of bread.' The stamps may have been used to seal messages within the dough. During the time these shrines were active, a written form of language had not yet emerged in this part of Armenia, and so there are no written records of its local rulers. The shrines were in use for a century until the area was destroyed by conflict. The group that controlled Gegharot was likely wiped out as a result. 'It doesn't appear to have been reoccupied,' said Professor Smith. 'It was probably attacked by one of its neighbours...but these practices probably went on in neighboring areas. 'We're now trying to figure out what exactly happened to these ancient people.' Archaeologists found two funnels (Figures A & B) ) that were used to burn substances at the shrine site . Figures D and E show stamp seals that could have been used to stamp images on pieces of dough before they were used for divination. This would have been the Bronze Age version of a fortune cookie . Gegharot, where the three ancient shrines were uncovered, is a town in the Aragatsotn Province of Armenia . The shrines were found close together at Gegharot. Workshops dedicated to metal, bone and stone tool production were also found in this region .","Three Bronze Age shrines were recently found in Gegharot, Armenia .

"A Sherlock Holmes tale by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has been uncovered for the first time in 50 years . An unknown Sherlock Holmes story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for a fundraising sale as been unearthed after lying in an attic for almost 50 years. The 1,300-word tale starring the famous detective is part of a book of short stories created to help raise money to build a new bridge in the Scottish town of Selkirk after it was destroyed in 1902. The famous author - who visited the area often - decided to help locals by contributing to the 'Book o' the Brig', which was sold at the three-day bazaar two years later. Walter Elliot, 80, was given the 48-page pamphlet by a friend more than 50 years ago and had forgotten about it until recently after looking in his attic. The two-and-a-half page story, titled 'Sherlock Homes: Discovering the Border Burghs and, by deduction, the Brig Bazaar', is about the sleuth and Watson's trip to the town. It is believed the story - about Holmes deducing Watson is going on a trip to Selkirk - is the first unseen Holmes story by Doyle since the last was published over 80 years ago. He was prompted to write the tale after the town was struck by a great flood in 1902 and the town's Wood Brig crossing the Ettrick in the Scottish Borders was washed away. The great-grandfather from Selkirk, who found the book tied together with string, said: 'In Selkirk there was a wooden bridge that was put up some time before it was flooded in 1902. 'The town didn't have the money to replace it so they decided to have a bazaar to replace the bridge in 1904. 'They had various people to come and do things and just about everyone in the town did something. 'The local MPs and landowners and everyone in two days I think took in £560, which was quite some sum then. The 1,300-word tale starring the famous detective is part of a book of short stories by locals in Selkirk, Scotland . The 'Book o' the Brig' was given to Walter Elliott, 80, by a friend but he'd forgotten about it for half a century . 'The Saturday was opened by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He had written a wee story about Sherlock Holmes and Watson and this was in the book. 'I can't remember how much they raised but they wanted it to be a carriage bridge but they didn't get quite enough for that, but they built an iron bridge and it's still there today. The Sherlock tale starts with a newspaper editor dispatching a journalist to London to find 'a word from Sherlock Holmes' and Watson. The writer finds the pair and watches them in conversation - as Holmes declares he's going to Edinburgh to solve the 'mysteries of the Secret Cabinet'. He asks Watson if he'd like to go with him but when Watson says he can't go Holmes sounds surprises and says he thought he was 'going to the Border country'. Watson then asks him how he knows that and Holmes, using his usual powers says it is a 'matter of deduction'. He says Watson had recently discussed politics of the north and had used a term 'huz' which is only found in a certain area of Scotland. Holmes also says he heard Watson 'crooning a weird song' which he must have read or heard while previously in Hawick, Scotland. He says 'later still the plot deepened' when Watson began 'lilting' another local song and then showed knowledge of James IV. Homes says the clues means Watson must be heading to either Hawick, Galashiels, or Selkirk. He says he then 'smoked a ton of tobacco' and spent the night in thought and worked out he was heading to Selkirk. Watson then admits he is indeed 'going to Selkirk in aide of a Bridge' and Holmes wishes him well on his journey. 'He really must have thought enough of the town to come down and take part and contribute a story to the book. It's a great little story.' The book - around ten inches long and three inches wide with a soft brown paper cover - contained stories from local people, as well as the famous author. The back cover details a programme of events and proudly states 'the famous litterateur' was due to open the day before the ladies orchestra performed and local piano recitals. 'It was a varied book with lots of bits and pieces and stories,' said Mr Elliott, a retired woodcutter and father-of-three. 'I have no idea how many they made and sold. I've had this book for about 40 or 50 years. I must have got it from a friend because I can't remember buying it from anyone. 'Usually people would throw out these books or sell them off. It has been in my family for quite a while now. 'I have no idea if it has ever been published - I've never seen it. I've always been interested in history and my family has always passed on stories and I suppose this was one of the stories that was passed down.' Sarah Dunnigan, a senior lecturer in English Literature at University of Edinburgh, said: 'This seems like a really fun piece, it's self-parodic, makes a playful jibe against journalists, and wittily compresses Scottish Borders history in an affectionate tribute to Selkirk - all whilst leaving the reader wondering where both the story, and Watson, are heading. 'It feels like Conan Doyle really enjoyed writing it.' Sir Conan Doyle returned to the town a few months later with a cricket team to play Selkirk. In 1905 he gifted a now-lost Border league football trophy, called the Conan Doyle Cup, last won by Kelso in 1937-38. A year later, Conan Doyle stood as a Unionist candidate for Westminster in the nearby Hawick Burghs constituency. The booklet will be on show at the Cross Keys Selkirk Pop-up Community Museum from Saturday, along with Mr Elliot's painting of the replaced bridge. This painting shows Bannerfield's Bridge, before it was washed away by a great flood in 1902. After the flooding, the town held a fundraising sale to build a replacement and it was here that the book was sold .

"A young mother moved into her new home to find it daubed in racist graffiti and a threatening note put through to door saying the flat block was for 'black sisters and brothers'. Sammie Sunter, 24, was taking her sons, aged two and five, to see their new home in Willenhall, Coventry, for the first time on Monday when they found the front door smeared in anti-vandal paint. It was also covered in vile graffiti and faeces, while a racist note stating 'Willenhall is black so f*** off' was posted through the letterbox. Scroll down for video . Sammie Sunter, 24, with her sons Oscar, 5, (left) and Harvey, 2, (right) inside their flat, which was targeted by threatening notes and racist graffiti when they arrived to move in on Monday . One of the notes that was put through the letterbox had been written over a Coventry City Council letter and said: 'We are watching you white b****. Africa rules' The note had been put inside an envelope marked 'Message inside oyinbo b****' - Nigerian slang for a white person, while another message inside read: 'Black power. Don't stay too long or else...'. The hairdresser was handed the keys from housing association, Whitefriars, last Wednesday and spent the rest of the week decorating the boys' bedrooms. She left the flat at 4pm on Sunday and returned with two-year-old Harvey and five-year-old Oscar, at 9am on Monday morning to see her house had been targeted. Ms Sunter said: ' I had to explain racism to my five-year-old. It's just not acceptable. He didn't really understand. If we are equal what gives the person responsible the right to do that? The door had been covered in black anti-vandal paint and smeared in faeces when Ms Sunter arrived at their new home with her two boys . 'I told him that whoever was responsible was going to get punished, but who knows if that will happen.' The mother-of-two, who is due to be re-housed following the incident, has lived in Willenhall for 15 years and said she has never experienced anything like this before. 'These people make Willenhall out to be some sort of ghetto,' Sammie said. 'They say it's their area but it's really not - there's a little old white man living in the flat below. 'The whole point of this is that it's not right. I'm not going to sit there and take it. 'I had to have a police escort away from my property and I knew I was being watched. You hold your head up high but it's disgusting.' When she called the housing association she was told that there had been a 'previous incident' at the address. 'Whitefriars were the first people I rang when this happened and when I spoke to someone they said they didn't think it would happen again,' she said. 'I think they have allowed this to happen. If it's happened before, and they have neglected to tell me, then they have put me and my children in danger.' The incident was reported to West Midlands Police, who said it was treating the attack as racially aggravated criminal damage and it was being taken 'very seriously'. Officers have made door-to-door inquiries while forensics experts are studying the note and they are also liaising with Whitefriars. Police are hopeful that because the flat looks out onto a busy street, there will have been some witnesses. Carmel McCarthy, director of housing and neighbourhood services, said: 'We absolutely deplore the actions reported and are working closely with the police to identify the culprit and to press for the strongest possible actions to be taken against them. 'There had been a previous incident reported at the property, which we passed on to the police for investigation. We closely monitor these events and in this case it appeared to be a one-off incident. Another threatening note said 'These flat are for black sisters and brothers. Willenhall is black so f*** off' The envelope put through the door had the word 'oyinbo' on - which is Nigerian slang for white person, and a drawing of a gun . 'Black power. Don't stay to long or else...': Police are treating the incident 'very seriously' and has conducted door-to-door investigations . 'As soon as Ms Sunter drew this incident to our attention, we offered her another home, which she will be moving into shortly. 'We have been working closely with Ms Sunter and the police on this incident and will continue to do so. 'Whitefriars always seeks to take strong action against any and all hate crime and we have close links with the police who work with us to investigate and prosecute these types of incidents.'

Eager to try and prove to her parents that there were better nannies and babysitters available, Noa took matters into her own hands and began sourcing childcare services for her own family - and then a number of her family friends. 'I realized that agencies didn't realize what that real New York nanny was,' she told the Today show. 'It's not a qualification, it's not something you can just see in a personality, it's really just a vibe you get and I knew what that vibe was. 'So I helped my mom get someone great, then I helped some family friends... and the business really took off from there.' Three years after her business was founded, with the help of her father, Noa now employs more than 75 people, around 25 full-time nannies and 50 part-time babysitters. Nannies for Noa takes a 15 per cent cut of its full-time employees' salaries, which range from $50,000 to $80,000 per year. When it comes to part-time babysitting services, clients are charged a flat rate of $5. All of which amounts to some fairly impressive profits - which Noa refuses to divulge or discuss. However, business has now become so busy for Noa and her team that the precocious teenager has had to appoint a CEO to take over the day-to-day running of the company so that she can focus more time and energy on her school work. Working 9 to 5: Noa still keeps a close eye on any and all developments within her company, which now employs more than 75 people . Helping hand: Allison Johnson (L) was hired as the company's new CEO. The 26-year-old is a licensed social worker and originally applied to the company as a full-time nanny . Enter 26-year-old Allison Johnson, a licensed social worker who originally applied to Noa's company as a nanny and ended up as its new CEO. 'At the end of eighth grade, I started to realize that I wasn't doing the business justice by putting in so many hours, because those hours weren't quality hours,' she explained. Now, Noa takes more of a backseat role when it comes to all of the daily administration required to run such a booming business - but still ensures that she keeps a beady eye on any and all developments that take place. Still, even after three years of running such a successful business, Noa admits that people are still skeptical when they first learn about her age. 'People will doubt me and I think that I always try and assure people that I'm a businesswoman, I really know what I'm doing, I've learned a lot,' she added. 'And people really trust me and that really vouches for how successful our brand has been that they would trust someone so young and they've been so pleased with our nannies.'","Noa Mintz founded Nannies by Noa during her sixth grade summer vacation .

"A Muslim convert who planned to behead a soldier had been radicalised by Britain’s most notorious hate preacher just weeks before, it can be revealed today. Brustholm Ziamani, 19, fell under the spell of cleric Anjem Choudary and his followers last April and became obsessed with the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Months after joining the preacher’s banned terror group al-Muhajiroun (ALM), he underwent a dramatic transformation that culminated in him wandering the streets looking for a serviceman to execute in a Woolwich-style killing. Message of hate: Muslim convert Brustholm Ziamani during an Islamist protest in London in May last year . A knife was found in his rucksack when he was arrested which police said he planned to use in the attack . A hammer was also found in the bag. Police had been following him for some time before they arrested him . As Ziamani was yesterday found guilty of arming himself with a hammer and a 12-inch knife for the copycat attack, the UK’s most senior counter terrorism officer said the case illustrated how quickly disaffected young Britons could be radicalised. Police and MI5 consider the plot to be one of the most serious to have threatened the UK since the escalation of the Syrian conflict. Detectives were so concerned at the speed of his radicalisation that after his first arrest in June Scotland Yard launched the biggest counter-terrorism surveillance operation since the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, dedicating 40 officers full time to keep tabs on him. Known to his friends as Bruce, Ziamani was raised a devout Jehovah’s Witness by his Congolese parents, who took him door-to-door preaching and forced him to read the Bible daily. Inflammatory messages: Ziamani fell under the spell of cleric Anjem Choudary (pictured) and his followers . Chilling: When detectives arrested Ziamani  they found a letter in which he pledged to behead British soldiers . The court heard Ziamani, 19, planned to use a black Islamic flag after he had attacked a soldier or politician . But he rebelled against his strict upbringing, leaving school with no qualifications to join a gang involved in robberies, drug dealing and procuring prostitutes. Murdered: Ziamani became obsessed with the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby (pictured) Within two weeks of meeting Choudary’s mob at Camberwell Mosque, he was writing on Facebook: ‘Sharia law is on its way. On our streets we will implement it.’ Overnight, he converted to radical Islam, tucking his ankle-length robes underneath his clothes and stashing copies of the Koran at his girlfriend’s house to keep his beliefs hidden from his parents. Soon after, Ziamani left the family home in Camberwell and slept at the mosque before moving in with a member of the ALM group – who mentored him at secret meetings in the basement of a halal sweet shop. When detectives first arrested Ziamani in June they discovered a letter in which he pledged to behead British soldiers. Incredibly, Scotland Yard decided to release him on bail when he denied planning any attack. Killers: Ziamani was arrested in August carrying a rucksack with weapons wrapped in an Islamic flag – hoping to emulate his ‘heroes’, Woolwich killers Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) Court sketch: Ziamani claimed he joined the radical group for somewhere to stay but was found guilty of plotting the attack . And despite close monitoring, Ziamani managed to buy a hammer. 'It was almost laughable': Ziamani’s ex-girlfriend (pictured) recalled how the ‘kind, affectionate’ teenager she loved changed within weeks . He was arrested again in Whitechapel, east London, on August 19 carrying a rucksack with weapons wrapped in an Islamic flag – hoping to emulate his ‘heroes’, Woolwich killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. Ziamani’s ex-girlfriend yesterday recalled how the ‘kind, affectionate’ teenager she loved changed within weeks. The 17-year-old said he tried to convert her – showing her video tutorials on how to tie a hijab and looked up Muslim baby names. She added: ‘It was almost laughable – the night I first met him I was wearing a short dress and heels.’ As Ziamani was warned he faced a substantial jail sentence at the Old Bailey, Choudary said his protege ‘didn’t stand a chance’ because the jury was ‘biased’. Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Commander Richard Walton, said: ‘Ziamani was an impressionable young man who became radicalised then rapidly developed an extremist, violent mindset.’ To my beloved parents.

"A disabled woman was strangled to death by her husband as she begged him to stop after he suffered delusions that they were broke and about to be evicted, a court heard. Nigel Talman, 60, called police and admitted throttling his wife of 20 years, Sandra, at the retirement complex they shared in Newbury, Berkshire, last August. He had been suffering from psychosis and delusions during a sudden spiral into severe depression and was jailed for six years today. Nigel Talman, 60, (left) strangled his disabled wife Sandra (right) to death after believing they were broke and going to be evicted, a court heard . Talman, wearing a black suit and white shirt, showed no emotion as details of the killing were read out to the court and dozens of tearful family members. Prosecuting, William Mousley QC, told the court how Mrs Talman, 62, had been sleeping on the sofa when she was awoken by her husband's hands tightening around her neck. He said she opened her eyes and begged him to 'please stop,' but he ignored her pleas and squeezed tight for up to two minutes until she stopped struggling. The mother-of-three, who walked with a frame and had a mobility scooter, attempted to fend him off, scratching her husband with her nails. The court heard how Talman, a former exemplary Thames Water employee, had lost his grip on reality as he descended into a mental crisis in the weeks before the killing. He became paranoid his neighbours were watching him, struggled to sleep and would periodically turn off all the lights and prevent his wife from making phone calls, the jury was told. Talman, who was due to retire imminently, became convinced that the couple had no money and would become homeless. However, police who carried out a financial audit after the killing, found Talman's fears about bailiffs were entirely unfounded, as he had plenty of money in the bank. He had been suffering from psychosis and delusions during a sudden spiral into severe depression, believing they would be convicted from their retirement flat in Newbury (pictured) The court heard that by August Talman was being seen by health professionals on an almost-daily basis, but he was finding no relief in his medication and had only had one counselling appointment. In her final days Mrs Talman confided in her sisters about her fears for her safety as her husband's mental condition declined further. She told sister Wendy: 'I can't chuck him out because I still love the old b******.' Officers were called to the couple's house at 7.28am on August 17 after Talman rang police to confess to the killing. Mrs Talman's body was found on the couch where she had been sleeping and a post mortem examination showed the cause of death was compression of the neck. Less than 24 hours before, a nurse had visited the home to prescribe Talman diazepam to help with his chronic insomnia and he was scheduled to see a consultant on the following Monday. However, his mental health had deteriorated the day before he throttled his wife, as he had called 999 to get an ambulance for Mrs Talman, believing she was ill. Paramedics who came to the house were more concerned about Talman's health but he successfully masked the full extent of his problems in front of them. Talman was arrested and charged the following day with his wife's murder but prosecutors dropped the initial charge after two psychologists agreed that Talman was so depressed he was not able to think clearly at the time he killed his wife. Talman previously admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility when he appeared before a judge at Reading Crown Court. The court heard how troubled Talman had felt he had 'no way out' of his mental prison, stopping to take the medication and making frequent crisis calls to mental health teams. Appealing for leniency on account of Talman's delusional beliefs that he was carrying out a mercy killing, Sally Ann Hales QC, defending, said he was 'appalled' at what he had done. 'Mr Talman did not plan to kill his wife,' she said. 'He has expressed remorse, he feels remorse, and this offence would never have happened but for the fact that he was demonstrably very unwell. 'It wasn't premeditated, it wasn't planned but (quoting Talman) ""I didn't want Sandra to be part of the mess I had created"". 'It was this kind of ""mess"" he wanted to stop, rather than Sandra per se. He was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to manslaughter at Reading Crown Court (pictured) 'It is evident that by August 16 the calm, unflappable and reliable man known to his family, had changed beyond recognition.' Ms Hales added: 'One would think what happened to him could almost happen to any one of us, because his life, until now, had been pretty unremarkable.' The couple had been together for more than 20 years after he separated from his first wife in 1993. Talman had left school aged 16 years and started working at Thames Water when he was aged 25 years, where colleagues described him as 'easy going' and 'kind.' He had a daughter, Sarah, from his first marriage, and Mrs Talman had three sons, Stephen, Nicky and Sam, from a previous relationship. In a moving victim impact statement, her son Stephen paid tribute to his 'kind, loving mother,' who had battled cancer but 'never gave up.' His brother Nicky was one of several family members who spoke of night terrors they have experienced since Mrs Talman's death, saying he was haunted by nightmares in which Talman was chasing him. Her sister Wendy said: 'The day I received the phone call was the worst day of my life. 'The first person I wanted to call was Sandra. She was always the first up dancing, having fun. Even with her disabilities she was always enjoying life.' Sentencing Talman to six years behind bars, a judge said he took the defendant's severe mental health problems into account but that he had to bear some responsibility for his actions. Judge John Reddihough said: 'On the morning of August 17 you strangled to death your 62-year-old wife Sandra, a woman who had been together with you for some 20 years. 'Clearly she had a zest for life, she was greatly loved and will be missed by her family and friends. 'In the days before her death, despite your behaviour, she was still professing her continuing love for you.' He said psychiatrists agreed Talman had been 'very unwell' with a severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms and insomnia ahead of the attack, with 'delusions of poverty' consuming him. There was said to be little risk, now Talman's illness had been successfully treated in prison with a mix of antidepressants and vital antipsychotics, of him re-offending. 'Sentencing in cases such as this that arise, at least in part, due to mental distress, is never straightforward,' Judge Reddihough continued. 'Although it is clear from the psychiatric evidence your mental responsibility for killing your wife was diminished, in my judgement, a not insignificant amount of responsibility remained. 'You made the decision not to take all your medication. Certainly you were able to mask the extent of your mental health difficulties. 'At the time of your offence you were able to make up your mind to kill your wife. You knew she was vulnerable to attack because of her health. 'She put up a struggle. You ignored her. You were strangling her for a considerable amount of time, because by then you were determined to kill her. You took the life of another human being.' Adrian Foster, chief crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said they had discussed dropping the murder charge with Mrs Talman's family. He said: 'When Talman pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, we carefully and thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in this case, including the assessment of psychiatric experts. 'In light of all the evidence, we took the view that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction for murder. 'We fully discussed our decision to accept the plea with Sandra's family. We hope that the conviction and today's sentence brings them at least a small sense that justice has been done.' Investigating officer Chief Inspector Ailsa Kent said: 'This is a desperately sad case and although today's decision will never bring Sandra back, I hope it will go some way to helping Sandra's family and friends feel that justice has been done.'","Nigel Talman, 60, called the police and admitted throttling his wife to death .

"A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, founded by Bill in 2001, said it would review foreign donations if Hillary runs for president . A charity founded by former President Bill Clinton has defended receiving donations from foreign governments even as Hillary is tipped to join the next race for the White House. The Clinton Foundation recently lifted a self-imposed ban on foreign donations and launched a $250million endowment drive, receiving money from the likes of Saudi Arabia and Oman. And today the organisation, which is run by Bill and Hillary along with daughter Chelsea, defended the practice, saying they would review it if any presidential campaign was launched. A spokesman said the non-profit receives support from 'individuals, organizations and governments from all over the world' and that its programs improve the lives of millions of people. The spokesman added: 'Should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office, we will continue to ensure the foundation's policies and practices regarding support from international partners are appropriate, just as we did when she served as secretary of state.' According to the Wall Street Journal the foundation has received money from the United Arab Emirates and a Canadian government agency promoting the Keystone XL pipeline. The Post found the foundation had raised nearly $2billion since  it launched in 2001. About one-third of the foundation's donations of $1million or more came from foreign governments or entities based outside the United States, the Post analysis found. The charity has since agreed to disclose its donors online and noted in the statement that it has a 'record of transparency that goes above what is required of U.S. charities.' The foundation has said its Clinton Global Initiative has improved the lives of 430 million people in 180 countries since 2005. The foundation stopped raising money from foreign governments in 2009 when Hillary became Obama's secretary of state amid concerns over a conflict of interest. However, once Hillary left the post in 2013 this embargo was dropped and the foundation began its endowment push to provide 'long-term stability'. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Michael Short, said the 'alarming rate at which these contributions are now coming in presents a massive conflict of interest problem.' The charity stopped accepting foreign donations at the request of Obama officials while Hillary was secretary of state, but started again with a $250million endowment drive after she left the post in 2013 .","Charity handed money by United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman .

"A 17-year-old boy has been hailed a hero for pulling a 73-year-old man to safety after they were both hit by a truck - even though the teen had himself suffered three fractured vertebrae. Dalton Surbey, a high school junior from Montpelier, Ohio, came to Duane Ward's aid during a car accident on Ohio 576 during white-out conditions on Saturday, according to the Bryan Times. Surbey had stopped at the scene of a crash and climbed out of his car to check on the driver when his car was rear-ended by another vehicle, according to the Ohio State Patrol. Ward also got out of his car to check on the scene when a black Ford Range truck hit both of them. Quick-thinking: Dalton Surbey, left in a photo he shared from hospital, managed to pull Duane Ward, right, to safety after they were both hit by a truck during white-out conditions in Ohio on Saturday . They were thrown in the air and Ward, also from Montpelier, suffered a broken pelvis and tailbone. 'I was knocked to the ground and could not get out of the way,' Ward told the Bryan Times. 'I couldn't move. I thought I was going to get run over.' Surbey fractured three vertebrae but he knew he had to act. 'I felt some pain when I stood up,' he said. 'Then I heard him scream and I started looking for him... He was in the opposite lane and I thought, 'I can't let him stay there'.' He ran over to Ward and took him to a ditch by the side of the road before checking no one else was hurt, he said. If Ward had remained in the road, he would have been in 'imminent danger' so the teenager may well have saved his life, Ohio State Patrol Sergeant Michael McClain told CBS News. Heroic: Ward, a high school junior, said he had not wanted the stranger to suffer even worse injuries . Dangerous: A photograph of a different crash scene (taken in Columbus, Ohio) shows the treacherous driving conditions motorists were facing amid the snow on Saturday . Ward agreed. 'If he would not have been there, I probably wouldn't be here,' he said. 'Certainly, he is a hero.' Surbey, a high school basketball player, was also treated in hospital but has since been released. He shared photos from inside hospital to his Twitter page. 'Well there goes the rest of the season,' he wrote. He told the Bryan Times he did not want to be considered a hero. 'I just thought he was in trouble and the last thing I wanted was for him to get hurt worse,' he said.","17-year-old Dalton Surbey's car was hit twice during a multi-car crash in Ohio on Saturday .

"Three men being sought by police over the alleged racist incident involving Chelsea football fans on a Paris Metro train have been identified, detectives revealed today. Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed they were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in France on Tuesday. The Metropolitan Police said the three men had now been identified and the force was liaising with the French authorities. None of the men sought by Scotland Yard have been arrested. Scroll down for video. Identified: Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed they were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in France on Tuesday . Pushed off the train: The shocking footage was filmed before the Premier League team's 1-1 draw in a Champions League fixture with Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes . The Chelsea fans could be heard chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' on the train . Supporters have identified five people as either witnesses or participants in the incident, which happened ahead of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. They are Josh Parsons, a 21-year-old City worker, and his younger brother, Benji; Jordan Munday, 20; Mitchell McCoy, 17; and 23-year-old Jamie Fairbairn. A police spokesman said the force cannot arrest people for offences which happen outside the UK but ‘a number of people’ have now been spoken to in relation to the incident. Footage posted online showed the commuter - named in reports as Souleymane S - being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of ‘we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it’. Circled: Jordan Munday has been named locally as  being on the train.  There is no suggestion he was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting but could be a key witness for police . On camera: Friends said Josh Parsons (left) who attended £30,000-a-year Millfield School appears (right) in this image from the horrifying video. The 21-year-old City worker has not spoken out against the allegations . Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident. The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club were ‘appalled’ by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich was also ‘disgusted’. Meanwhile, British Transport Police are seeking a gang of men, believed to be Chelsea fans, who were heard shouting racist chants at London St Pancras station on Wednesday evening. 'Ashamed': Jose Mourinho said at a press conference that he was 'ashamed and disgusted' by the racism . Victim: Father-of-three Souleymane S was trying to get home when he was thrown off the train in Paris . A member of the public reported the men, who had travelled by train from Paris Gare du Nord, officers said. It is believed they were returning home after attending Chelsea's 1-1 draw with PSG. Last week, millionaire comedian and self-styled anarchist Russell Brand, a West Ham fan, blamed the disgraced Chelsea fans’ racist thuggery in Paris on football’s recent £5billion TV rights deal. However, he insisted he was not trying to excuse racism. Brand, 39, accused the Premier League of ‘garnering huge wealth and hogging it for itself’, rather than ‘sharing the bounty with fans’. His comments sparked outrage among some blog followers. Responding to Brand, a Premier League spokesman said: ‘Regardless of ownership models, racist behaviour is not acceptable.' The incident involved father-of-three Souleymane being pushed off a train as fans of the London club chanted racist remarks. The victim said it had left him 'hurt to the bottom of his heart'. Rival football supporters posted a humorous video today of a black man being welcomed on board a train by a white man, telling Chelsea fans: ‘This is how we do it at West Ham.’ The clip sees a black man walk up to the train door, asking a white man: ‘Can I get on the train, sir?’ The white man then responds by saying: ‘This is West Ham my friend, on you come.’ The video was posted on Twitter by Arron Thomas today, and has since received more than 1,400 retweets. Hammers fan Russell Brand said: 'Comedy as a weapon against hate. Very funny.' Mr Thomas said in the post at 10.45am: ‘Claret and blue is all that matters!’  West Ham fans were attending their side’s game at Tottenham Hotspur today, which finished 2-2.","Police hunting racist Chelsea supporters released images of three men .

"Prosecutors have brought torture and child abuse charges against the father and stepmother of a 12-year-old Detroit boy who was found in his father's basement last year after an 11-day disappearance. Charles Bothuell IV, 46, and Monique Dillard-Bothuell, 37, systematically physically abused the child, forced him to live in the basement and didn't allow him to socialize, Wayne County prosecutors said. The boy, Charlie Bothuell V, was found by police in the basement of his family's condominium on June 25, 2014, - 11 days after he was reported missing by his father and stepmom. Detroit police arrested the Bothuells this morning, the prosecutor's office said. They have each been charged with one count of torture, punishable by up to life in prison, and second-degree child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison. Charlie Bothuell IV (left) and Monique Dillard-Bothuell (right) systematically physically abused the Charlie V, forced him to live in the basement and didn't allow him to socialize, Wayne County prosecutors said . Bothuell, a nurse, had made tearful pleas on TV for his son's return and later said he was ‘shocked’ when the boy was found in the basement. Charlie was deprived of food and forced to engage in an 'extreme and unreasonable exercise regime,' Prosecutors said in a statement. He ‘has experienced physical abuse by his father... for the entire two years he has resided in Mr. Bothuell's residence,’ the Department of Human Services said in a court filing. ‘The abuse included being physically disciplined with a PVC pipe on his butt, feet, chest, head, thighs, sides and arms... He was often too sore to sit or walk.’ But Charlie told caseworkers that his stepmother ordered him to the basement on June 14, 2014 because she believed he had not completed one of his twice-a-day workouts. His workout regime included 100 pushups, 200 situps, 100 jumping jacks, 25 arm curls with a 25-pound weight and thousands of revolutions on an elliptical machine. Charlie said his stepmom, who has two other children, told him, ‘Shut up, stay quiet and don't say anything no matter what you hear!’ Twelve-year-old Charlie Bothuell V, was deprived of food and forced to engage in an 'extreme and unreasonable exercise regime,' Prosecutors said in a statement. He was found hiding in his father's basement 11 days after his father and stepmom reported him missing . This is the  storage closet in the basement of the condominium townhouse where it is believed Charlie hid out during the eleven days he missing . While staying in the storage closet, Charlie was able to use this toilet and sink also located in the tunnel . Charlie said Dillard-Bothuell told him at times, ‘I know where the sharp knives are... I can make you disappear.’ Charlie was discovered in the cramped basement behind a makeshift barrier of boxes. Confusingly, FBI agents previously searched the basement, even using specially trained cadaver dogs. It then emerged there was an underground tunnel easily accessible from the basement, connecting the other condos in the block and leading outside the building. The tunnel’s outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, but crucially, it was left open during the time he was in the resident because residents were getting rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside. That means Charlie could have left the property in the day, before returning at night, explaining why FBI agents could not find the boy. Court documents apparently state that Charlie has claimed he even snuck upstairs for food when the house was empty. The father and stepmother earlier denied any abuse took place. The state Department of Human Services has said the father later acknowledged striking his son with a PVC pipe. Charlie Bothuell IV was shocked into silence when he was told on live TV that his 12-year-old son had been found alive in his basement, 11 days after he vanished . Charlie told caseworkers that his Dillard-Bothuell ordered him to the basement because she believed he had not completed one of his twice-a-day workouts: 100 pushups, 200 situps, 100 jumping jacks, 25 arm curls with a 25-pound weight and thousands of revolutions on an elliptical machine .

They added in a court filing last year that the boy told authorities he was forced to rise before dawn for his intense workouts. 'We are thankful that the victim was found alive,' prosecutor Kym Worthy said. 'This is the first time that the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office has charged torture for a living child. Based upon the allegations, if any case warrants child torture charges, this one certainly does.' Dillard-Bothuell was charged with an unrelated probation violation shortly after Charlie was found because there was a gun in the home and she had a prior gun conviction in Wayne County, according to MLive. Officials have temporarily stripped Bothuell and Dillard-Bothuell of their parental rights and taken Charlie's two half-siblings from the couple's home. A final custody decision has not been made by the courts. Bothuell and Dillard-Bothuell are due in court on Friday afternoon.","Charlie Bothuell V, 12, 'vanished' from his dad's Detroit home in June 2014 .

"Thousands of UK troops would be sent to Sierra Leone to enforce a military lockdown under radical plans to defeat ebola being considered by Britain’s most senior Army officer. General Sir Nick Carter is leading a review of the UK’s response to the virus, and could use 3,000 British soldiers to impose a blockade and restrict human movement in the African country. Sir Nick, the Chief of the General Staff, will advise Ministers on proposals, including an increase in troop numbers and using Royal Navy ships to patrol its coastal waters. Scroll down for video . Personel carry out duties on board the hospital ship RFA Argus as it prepares to leave its home port of Falmouth for Sierra Leone . The top-level review comes as charity Oxfam said a critical shortfall of Western military personnel in West Africa was in danger of putting lives at risk. It wants troops to deliver vital supplies and build treatment centres for victims. But defence sources disclosed last night that options to be considered by Sir Nick go much further and include UK troops deploying to towns and villages deep inside Sierra Leone. A source said: ‘From a military perspective ebola is like a biological warfare attack and should be countered accordingly. There needs to be a clampdown on human movement inside Sierra Leone and possibly to and from the country between now and late 2015 when it is hoped that an antidote will have been developed.’ Liberian soldiers patrol in Monrovia's West Point slum. British troops could be carrying out similar duties if a recommendation by the Chief of the General Staff is approved .

Those on the ship include doctors, nurses, surgeons and Royal Marines in a bid to tackle the ebola outbreak in West Africa . Sir Nick, who led thousands of UK troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, is expected to deliver recommendations by the end of this week. Currently 750 British military personnel are committed to stamping out ebola. The UK has also sent a hospital ship and three helicopters. Since the outbreak began more than 4,500 people have died from the disease. Experts fear the death toll could rise to a million by July next year. In a further move, the Government’s health watchdog Public Health England last night released specific advice for pregnant women concerned about contracting ebola, saying research suggested there is ‘limited evidence’ they are at increased risk of severe illness, medical complications and death when infected. Royal Navy medical ship RFA Argus leaves Falmouth, Cornwall for Sierra Leone carrying three Merlin helicopters and a crew of around 380 . It said: ‘Reported complications include spontaneous abortion and pregnancy-associated haemorrhage. Infants born to mothers who are in the terminal stage of disease are invariably infected.’ Meanwhile, the number of specialist beds available in the UK for ebola victims has been reduced following a legal row over building work at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Hospital. Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is withholding payments to the building company Laing O’Rourke Construction after claims that work on a £330million rebuilding project there is not up to standard. Sir Leonard Fenwick, the trust’s chief executive, said: ‘It means we can’t move to the next stage and build the centre for infectious diseases.’ Laing O’Rourke declined to comment due to legal proceedings.

"Forty-six New Jersey lottery winners from July 2013 to July 2014 used Social Security numbers of dead people to collect their winnings, the state auditor said. An audit released Wednesday said the use of dead people's identification numbers creates a risk of reduced tax revenue for the state, overpayment of public assistance and lost collections on child support, defaulted student loans and other debt. Auditor Stephen Eells said that up to $890,000 in prize winnings could have been recovered if winners below $250,000 were checked for debts against the Treasury Department's Set-Off of Individual Liability system. An audit said people used dead people's identification numbers to avoid having winnings garnished or paying taxes . The lottery now only checks winners of more than $250,000 in the SOIL system, but the audit recommends checks for all winners over $600. Executive Director Carole Hedinger said during the Lottery Commission's monthly meeting Thursday that they are aware people try to cheat the system and are working to tighten their regulations. 'What we are working on is trying to find or get authorization to go even further to verify the legitimacy of social security numbers, something we are currently not authorized to do,' Hedinger said, referring to federal law that she says prevents the lottery from performing automated Social Security matches for all state departments. According to the commission, 26 winners were flagged as owing money after their Social Security numbers came up in various state agency databases in January. Twenty-three of them had their winnings garnished for things like public assistance, food stamps and student loans. The lotto failed to examine winners taking in less than $250,000 or check Social Security numbers on claim forms . 'That's a problem with all industries with people using illegal Social Security (numbers). In fact, we are ahead of the curve,' said Lottery Commission Chairman Thomas Tucci. 'We've been working to try to get that corrected, it's just a matter of getting the regulators to give us the authority to go further.' Hedinger said in her written response to the audit that the lottery has to balance providing good service and timely payments with its legal responsibilities. She said that the lottery collected nearly $300,000 from winners that owed the state. USA Today notes that lottery fraud is often a sign of ticket discounting, meaning the winning ticket has been resold. Carole Hedinger, Executive Director of the New Jersey Lottery found nearly $900,000 in winnings had been claimed by the deceased according to an audit . If a winner wishes to avoid the scrutiny that would lead to garnishing, they can might sell the ticket to a third party for less than the prize value, a practice that is illegal. The third party is often a lottery retailer who will give the seller quick cash. The third party will then claim the prize under their names, or often that of a relative, which is how the deceased winners may have been entered. Eells added that the lottery wasn't verifying Social Security numbers on the claim forms.","Frauds got through as lotto officials failed to check Social Security numbers or scrutinize winners under $250,000 .
Fraud points to tickets discounting, the prohibited practice of selling a winning ticket to a third party to avoid scrutiny .
The third party may use a relative's name and Social Security numbers to avoid paying taxes themselves, potentially resulting in the name's of the deceased being entered ."
"It's no spring chicken! McDonald's is bringing back a menu item it got rid of just two years ago. The company has announced it is bringing back its chicken tenders, called Chicken Selects. Remember these? If you’ve been pining for McDonald’s Chicken Selects since they disappeared from the menu, the chain has great news for you this March as they will make a return in some cities out west . Flavorful: McDonald's started testing flavors that customers can shake onto their nuggets including Zesty Ranch, Chipotle BBQ and Garlic Parmesan . 'Chicken Selects will make a national return in early March and [will] be sold as an order with three pieces,' confirmed McDonald's spokeswoman Terri Hickey. 'We look forward to bringing back this customer favorite made with chicken tenderloin.' Chicken Selects were on the menu for a decade but were cut after the fast food chain trimmed its menu. McDonald's began testing seasoning flavors that customers can shake on nuggets this week. So far, only locations in Northern Nevada locations are part of the tryout. The flavors include zesty ranch, chipotle BBQ and garlic Parmesan. The new Shakin' Flavor offering will also be available in the San Francisco, Sacramento, Chico, and Fresno markets. Tryout: The flavors are currently being tested in some branches in Northern Nevada . To be sold only in three-piece orders at a recommended price of $2.99, Chicken Selects are 'a premium chicken product made from whole pieces of chicken tenderloin that are breaded and fried'. Chicken Selects were introduced in 1998 and added to the permanent menu in October 2003. They were sold in three-, five- and 10-piece orders and included several choices of dipping sauces. The return of the Chicken Selects comes at a good time for the poultry business. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recently reported a glut in chicken production. McDonald's has continued to sell other chicken items, such as Chicken Nuggets, which it has vigorously defended against 'rumors' that it contained undesirable ingredients. As beef and pork prices rise, both McDonald's and Burger King have rolled out price war campaigns over their respective chicken offerings to move inventory. McDonald's is offering 50 McNuggets for $9.99 at select locations, while Burger King is offering 15 cent nuggets—or 10 nuggets for $1.49. Rebound: The fast food giant has recently taken steps to make its menu shorter and simpler. This has been due to slowing sales in the United States .","McDonald's cut Chicken Selects from its menu in 2013 as part of an effort to streamline its offerings .

"High tides are forecast to batter the country this weekend as a storm sweeping in from the Atlantic brings 80mph gale force winds and coastal flooding. Devon, Somerset, the Bristol Channel, the south Wales coast and the English Channel are all expected to be affected, with flood warnings issued across much of the country as it braces itself for a wet and windy weekend coupled with 50ft high tides. The Environment Agency has warned of potential flooding across dozens of coastal areas, with the towns of Clevedon, Chepstow and Sheepway directly in the firing line.

'When we bought the house we knew there was a flood risk but the view we get out of the living room window makes the few floods we get a year worth while. 'The water floods the road for an hour and then it goes away. We are expecting more flooding this weekend.' A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: 'Our main area of concern is the north of the North West, specifically the coastline at Gretna to Silloth. 'It is not unusual for the Gretna to Silloth coastline to have flood warnings in place, coastal areas often suffer because of high tides.

"Britain has slipped down the European league table on living standards as families continue to feel the pinch of the economic downturn. An in-depth analysis by the EU measured material consumption in 37 European countries, including both private purchases and state spending, to give an accurate measurement of how well off people really are. In the latest figures, which cover 2011, Germany and Austria jumped ahead of Britain, which comes in at sixth – a year earlier it was fourth. Figures from Eurostat show how Britain has fallen from fourth in 2010 to sixth in 2011 in the European league table for standard of living . Rising energy bills have eaten in families' spending power, while spending cuts have eaten away at public services . Living standards here were reckoned to be 18 per cent above the European average. The . tiny banking and administrative state of Luxembourg was deemed to have . the highest standard of living on the continent, at a level 40 per cent . higher than the European average, with the non-EU states of Norway and . Switzerland ranking second and third. Analysts . at Eurostat, the EU statistics arm which is based in Luxembourg, . bracketed Britain with France in the household wealth sub-category of . its Actual Individual Consumption study. Overall French living standards were rated tenth – 13 per cent higher than the European average. The Eurostat analysis also concluded that Switzerland is now the most expensive country in Europe, at 65 per cent above the average, replacing Norway, while Macedonia is the least expensive, costing 58 per cent below the average. The UK was the 14th most expensive country in which to live in Europe, up from 15th the previous year. The results are more bad news for the Coalition at a time of deepening fears that the country is heading  into a triple-dip recession. Last week, official analysis also found that the amount a typical household is able  to pay to cover all its necessities and luxuries has dropped by nearly 10 per cent since the onset of the downturn. An average home in Britain had almost £50 a week less to spend last year than it did in 2006, once inflation had been taken into account. The Eurostat report found the lowest living standards were in Romania and Bulgaria, at 47 per cent and 45 per cent of average European levels.","New figures show the UK slipping down the European league table .

"With 11.9million people tuning in to find out who killed Lucy Beale, last night's episode of EastEnders brought an end to months of speculation. And as 11-year-old Bobby was unmasked as his half-sister's killer, thousands took to social media to express their shock and awe at the plot's outcome. But impatient viewers weren't the only ones kept in the dark as producers worked towards unveiling the killer's identity. Among the last people to find out was the 'killer' himself, with the actor playing murderous Bobby Beale only told of his role in the saga on Monday. Scroll down for video . The actor playing Bobby Beale was left in the dark about the murderous 11-year-old's storyline until just three days before the dramatic semi-live episode . Elliot Carrington, 12, was sworn to secrecy after being told of the twist just days before last night's episode. The actor, who has starred in Billy Elliot, Casualty and a host of TV adverts, was seen leaving the EastEnders set with a woman thought to be his mother shortly after the episode last night. Even his onscreen victim was left out of the loop, discovering Bobby's role as her murderer just hours before the nationwide audience. Speaking after show last night, Hettie Bywater, the actor who played Lucy, said: 'I was so shocked, I found out seven or eight hours ago. 'I had no idea. We've all been speculating a little bit, everyone was pushing towards Peter. I was completely wrong.' The revelation came after 10 months of precise planning and script-writing, with executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins thinking up the sinister plot a year ago. 'We've been looking over our shoulders for months and known who killed Lucy for about a year,' he said in a Q&A with series producer Sharon Batten last night. Eliot Carrington was seen leaving the studio last night after performing live. The 12-year-old had been sworn to secrecy after learning he was Lucy Beale's killer on Monday .

'We told Bobby on Monday. But we had told his Dad before that to check that it was OK of course, then we told him. 'Eliot (Carrington) is so clever though that when we told him he said: ""Oh that makes sense!""' Producers considered only one other outcome for the plot, reverting to Bobby as the murderer almost immediately. 'There was one other suspect for about a day and it didn't feel right. 'The story had to come from the heart and with this it's the start of a whole big new story for the Beales.' Mr Treadwell-Collins added he hoped viewers had enjoyed the year of suspense and not found it too frustrating.

The powerful Bengal tiger (pictured) chooses her moment to lunge at the three deer, who are drinking at a waterhole in the Tadoba Andhari reserve in India. Despite her speed the deer manage to escape . The dramatic scenes were captured by Stefan Cruysberghs at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in India. The 38-year-old software developer, from Lommel, Belgium, said: 'During our drive we stopped at a waterhole and three Sambar deer were drinking in the middle of the pool. 'Suddenly, we saw a tigress coming out of the high grass and sneaking into the water. 'What followed was one of the most exciting and amazing events in nature I have ever witnessed.' Stefan said that every time the deer bent their head to drink, the tigress swum closer. He said: 'After about five minutes, when she had approached the deer at a distance of about 12 metres, she started her ultimate attack. 'The three deer got away, but it was a thrilling moment.' Before the attack the three Sambar deer have no idea what is going to happen and take it in turns to  drink from the cool water . The tigress spots an opportunity while hiding in the high grass of the bank and slowly makes her way down to the water's edge . As she cautiously makes her way through the shallows, she keeps a watchful eye on the deer to ensure that none of them turn round . Photographer Stefan Cruysberghs said that every time the deer bent their head to drink, the endangered big cat swum closer . Only her ears and nose are visible as the canny tigress swims carefully through the water towards the deer . Stefan watched the seven-minute attack take place from around 50 metres away. In most cases a Bengal tiger approaches its victim from the side or behind. Once it has caught its prey, it grasps it by the throat to kill it. Big cats frequently eat wild boar and occasionally  grey langur monkeys. They also eat small prey such as porcupine and hares. Suddenly the big cat makes her move and lunges through the water, causing large waves and mud to splash around her . The cheeky female continues the chase through the water. Bengal tigers can weigh up to 325kg and can run up to 40mph . Perhaps due to the tiger's splashing the deer get plenty of notice and run to the nearest bank to escape . As the deer disappear into the background the tiger realises her fate. Mr Cruysberghs said: 'People are really surprised that we were able to witness this. Even our naturalist guide and driver had never seen a tiger attack prey in the water' Despite the attack the brave deer made their way back into the water. Stefan said: 'About twenty minutes later two of the deer came back into the water, fully aware that the tigress was still cooling down in the waterhole. 'They made alarm calls and were even challenging the tigress. She tried a second desperate attack, but still with no luck. 'As a tourist it is rare to see big predators hunting in Africa, and in India it is almost impossible. 'Tigers normally hunt at night so it was a once-in-a-lifetime-experience.' It is estimated there are approximately 2,200 Bengal tigers in the world. While the tiger cools off following the failed attack, two deer bravely make their way back into the water . The orange and black cat gives up and goes to the bank to dry off. A hungry tiger can eat as much as 27kg - or four stone . Two young Sambar deer play in the water after the attack and will be hoping that the tigress isn't still watching . He said: 'I felt extremely lucky and privileged to see a majestic but endangered tiger attacking deer in the wild. 'People are really surprised that we were able to witness this and even our naturalist guide and driver in the national park had never seen a tiger attack prey in the water.' Meanwhile, a Siberian tiger cub has been shown to the public for the first time at Tierpark Berlin zoo in Germany. The three-month-old is called Alisha and will be hand-raised.

"A starving four-month-old foal was left to die alone in freezing conditions after being dumped near a caravan park. The sweet piebald cob called Gizmo is battling to survive after he was found without his mother and seriously underweight near Ridgewell Caravan Park in Essex on Tuesday. He has been left so weak he can barely stand and was suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and pneumonia when he was rescued by the RSPCA along with police and veterinary staff. Gizmo, the four-month-old foal, was left abandoned in freezing conditions and dumped by a caravan park . He was rescued by the RSPCA on Tuesday and underwent an operation at Catley Cross Veterinary Clinic, where he is continuing to fight for his life . Sarah Elmy, from the charity, said: 'Poor Gizmo was just abandoned without his mum and left to die by the side of the road. 'He was so weak he was just collapsed and couldn't - and still can't - stand, and you can see every bone in his body, he's so thin. 'We had to carry him to the van on a rug. He was so keen to live, though, bless him. 'Even though he was lying flat out, he was trying to reach forward and crawl himself along the ground to get to grass. He was suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and pneumonia and could barely stand when he was found . Gizmo was so weak he had to be carried to the rescue van on a rug (pictured) 'As soon as we propped him up he was nibbling, trying to eat from our hand. It was so heartbreaking. I just really hope he pulls through - he's certainly trying his best.' An Essex Police spokesperson said: 'We assisted the RSPCA in recovering a sick horse in Yeldham Road in Ridgewell on February 17.' Gizmo underwent surgery at Catley Cross Veterinary Clinic and following a post on its Facebook page, people have stepped in to raise £11,000 to cover his care. Veterinary surgeon, Carolyn Wise, from the centre, said: 'It is touch and go at the moment. Gizmo is walking a fine line. 'But he is eating and trying to live so we have everything crossed he will pull through - he is such a lovely foal. He has melted all our hearts. 'It seems we are not the only ones as we have been overwhelmed by people phoning us wanting to help, after we put up a short appeal on our Facebook page. 'We are so grateful for such a heartwarming response. It just shows you how much people care.' More than £3,000 has already donated by 220 well-wishers in less than 24 hours, which already covers more than half his medical costs. The RSPCA, which has more than 600 horses in its care nationally, says any surplus funds will be used for the rescue and treatment of other horses in a similar situation. To donate towards battling Gizmo's care call 0300 123 0346 or visit justgiving.com/gizmothefoal.

"In the latest of ambitious building projects, officials in Dubai have confirmed work will start on designing 'Aladdin City.' Comprising six towers, all connected by moving walkways, the development is inspired by the tales of Aladdin from the Middle Eastern folk Tale The Arabian Nights and the more modern Disney blockbuster. The towers are said to be similar in design to the genie lamp, and are set to shimmer golden in the sunlight. There will be six predominant points to the project, which will be built in Dubai Creek . 'We plan to start work on the project next year; we have our own funds to finance the project,' director-general Hussain Nasser Lootah told the Future of Dubai website. The project was announced publicly in April last year, and will include commercial and hotel areas, as well as parking for 900 cars. The highest of the towers will measure 34 storeys; the development will spread some 1,500 feet along Dubai Creek, encompassing 4,000 acres in total. The area is a popular spot for old wooden fishing boats, and maintains an air of tradition about it; the new plans will fall outside the area set to be named a UNESCO World Heritage site. The development will have three main towers which look like something out of a Disney movie . 'The project aims to develop towers to be the icons of legends of the past with a touch of beauty and tourism characteristic of the city, added Lootah. 'It comes in the prime location of Dubai Creek maintaining the activities of the port heritage.' The total cost for the project has not been revealed. Situated close to 'Aladdin City' is Dubai's other extravagant design of the Burj Khalifa - the world's tallest building. Measuring 2,722ft, the construction began on January 6, 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on October 1, 2009. Work is scheduled to begin on the development in 2016, but the cost of the project has not been revealed . The building officially opened on January 4, 2010, and it is part of the 490-acre development called Downtown Dubai. However, another ambitious project has hit a stumbling block. The Dubai Eye, which was billed to be the world's biggest ferris wheel, was supposed to be open to the public this year, but this has been pushed back until 2018. Set to be 690ft tall, and attract more than three million visitors a year, the attraction is part of a one billion pound entertainment project called The Bluewaters Island. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the world's tallest building at 2,722ft tall and took around six years to complete . The 'Aladdin City' will add yet more enchantment to Dubai, whose mix of modern architecture to middle eastern design is heralded .","Development consists of three main towers, the tallest being 34 storeys, spread across 4,000 acres .

"Students in Pakistan are undergoing training to prepare them for potential terrorist attacks in the wake of the deadly Taliban strike on an Army School in Peshawar last year. School children and teachers have been visited by police and bomb disposal squads, practicing how to handle firearms, defuse explosives and provide emergency care. The new government directives follows the December 16 tragedy, which saw a group of   terrorists stormed the  Public Army School in Peshawar, killing 145 people, including 132 schoolchildren. Fighting back: Students across Pakistan are receiving anti-terrorism training, such as here in Karachi, Sindh where police is  providing arms training at a local facility . Students in Multan, Punjab, underwent emergency training which saw a bomb disposal squad instruct classes of girls how to locate and defuse an explosive device. The mock drill also trained the schoolgirls how to give assistance to 'injured' people and how to safely evacuate the school. 'We have received training and now we will utilise this if the need arises,' a female student at Multan Public School told Dawn.com. In Sindh province, teachers and students at the Mama Parsi school were trained by police at a centre in Karachi. Provincial police demonstrated self defence and gave the students weapons training. Anti-terror training: Students in Multan, Punjab, underwent a mock 'terrorist attack' drill training them how to give assistance to 'injured' people and how to safely evacuate the school . An instructor lies 'injured' after a fake bomb blast during the training session at a Pubjab girl's school . The students are undergoing the training to prepare them for potential terrorist attacks in the wake of the deadly Taliban strike on an Army School in Peshawar last year . The drills saw a bomb disposal squad instruct classes of girls how to locate and defuse an explosive device . 'This is our expertise in counter-terrorism,' Sindh Police's Maqsood Memon told Dawn.com. 'We are doing for the government but we thought it should be given to civil society in case of an emergency — they should know what to do if the need arises,' he said, adding that it is a public service campaign free of charge.' This is just the latest step in a nationwide campaign to prepare students and school staff against potential attacks in the wake of the December tragedy. In Peshawar, where the attack took place, female teachers are receiving combat training to 'engage' terrorists, with the first group finishing training last month. Officials in Peshawar, capital of Khyber Pakthunkhwa province, said the move would allow teachers to fight off terrorists 'for [an] initial five to 10 minutes' before back-up arrives. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa information minister Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani has said the training would allow school staff members to 'engage' attackers for five to ten minutes before law enforcement personnel could respond. He told reporters on January 13: 'The provincial cabinet has decided to allow teachers and other staff members to keep their licensed weapons with them so that in case of any eventuality they could engage attackers for initial five to 10 minutes before personnel of law-enforcement agencies will show up to respond to the attack.' Female teachers  in Peshawar, Pakistan, practice releasing the magazines and reloading the guns . Two teachers practice aiming an assault rifle during the training session, in which teachers were taught how to use guns, take cover and return fire . The 35,000 educational institutions - including schools, colleges and universities - across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been ordered to beef up security following the brutal attack on the Army Public School. Mr Ghani also announced earlier this month that authorities would build walls at least 8ft high around government-run education institutions, and would also introduce community policing systems whereby civilians with experience operating weapons would be trained and paid to guard educational facilities. Private sector schools, colleges and universities have meanwhile been issued with strict guidelines with requirements including having guards, Mr Ghani said, adding that schools' licenses could be revoked if they did not follow the rules. In response to the Taliban attack, Pakistan's parliament last week passed a constitutional amendment approving the establishment of military courts to hear terrorism-related cases. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also lifted the country's six-year-old moratorium on the use of the death penalty, reinstating it for terror cases in the wake of the slaughter at the school. However, critics have warned the move to arm teachers could put children at even greater risk, as well as affect teachers' performance at work.","School children in Pakistan prepared for potential terrorist attacks .

"The mother of a 22-year-old Canadian man who died fighting for ISIS has spoken out to warn parents how easily jihadist groups can manipulate Westerners online. Christianne Boudreau's son Damian Clairmont converted to Islam at the age of 17 after bullying at high school in Calgary, Alberta, almost drove him to suicide. Religion seemed to bring him peace, she said, and she thought his plan to visit the Middle East to study Arabic would be a positive experience. But in 2013, Canadian security officials visited Boudreau to say they strongly suspected her son was not a student in Egypt but a jihadi in Syria. In January 2014, he was killed fighting for ISIS in Aleppo. Christianne Boudreau's (left) son Damian Clairmont (right) died fighting for ISIS in Aleppo in January 2014 . A year on, Boudreau says parents must resist the urge to  blame others and do what they can to address extremist propaganda with their children. She told CNN: 'The biggest problem we have is that parents - a lot of the time - want to be able to place the blame somewhere else. 'We want think that our children are safe and it could never happen to us. It's always going to happen to somebody else. That's a big mistake we all make as parents.' Damian Clairmont, who changed his name to Mustafa Al-Gharib, told the National Post he joined ISIS to work toward an afterlife. He is believed to have been shot dead by the Free Syrian Army. Challenges: According to Boudreau, Damian had been a happy child (pictured) but became reclusive at school . A year on from Damian's death, Boudreau says parents must actively combat propaganda targeted at kids . According to Boudreau, Damian had been a happy child but became reclusive at school. Islam was the first thing that seemed to make him grounded, happy and peaceful. 'I saw some positive changes start to happen,' she told the network. 'He became social again. The old Damian that I knew when he was younger, much younger, was starting to come out. 'He was socializing, he was peaceful, he was grounded, he wasn't drinking, he wasn't using drugs, there were lots of positive changes.' However, unbeknownst to her, Damian was slowly becoming radicalized as he searched for extremist literature online and joined a different mosque. Boudreau maintains that he went to Syria to help women and children but was brainwashed into siding with ISIS. Members of Islamist rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra pose for a picture at a checkpoint in Aleppo. The group, a spin-off from ISIS, is the one Clairmont (not pictured) is believed to have joined when he moved over . The biggest challenge for the West is developing a rhetoric that can counteract the Islamic State's persuasive propaganda that is winning over young people worldwide. 'What's out there is only something that can reinforce those ideas so we really need to start challenging the ideologies that are being placed in their minds,' Boudreau said. Her focus now this past year has been on Clairmont's younger siblings who have been shaken by the ordeal. 'We were living in a really desperate black hole of trauma and we didn't know how to heal from it, and I was terrified that the anger would burn within them and not being able to cope with this type of trauma and that they would follow the same path,' she said.","Damien Clairmont, 22, was killed fighting for ISIS in Syria in 2014 .

"A mother left devastated by the death of her grown-up son 10 years ago has had another baby - aged 60. Galina Hrustaev gave birth to little Cleopatra by Cesarean section at the Filatov Hospital in the Russian capital Moscow, and has since been proudly been showing off the little girl on social media. But she has so far refused to say whether she had any help conceiving - despite the fact there has only been one recorded case of a woman getting pregnant naturally over the aged of 60. Record: Galina, seen here with husband Alexey and baby Cleopatra, is thought to be Russia's oldest mother . Galina's motivation to have another child was sparked by the tragic loss of her son a decade ago. Her husband Alexey, meanwhile, has a 27-year-old daughter from his first marriage. 'The main thing is that I tragically lost my son of 29 years from my first marriage just when he was in the prime of life,' she revealed. 'Afterwards I felt an incredible desire to have another child, even though it was so late in life, and I have now fulfilled that desire.' Galina, who did not say how her son had died, said that she was now devoting all of her efforts to spending time with Cleopatra, who was born weighing just over six pounds. Alexey told Russian media they were both delighted with the new arrival - and others seem to be just as happy. Her close friend Faina Sukhorukova posted on her Facebook page: 'I know that you always said you wanted another baby, but I never knew that you really meant it. 'I've always admired your determination, congratulations. I know you will be a perfect mother.' Normal: Cleopatra was born by Cesarean section weighing just over six pounds at full term . Natural?: The couple have so far refused to reveal whether or not they used IVF to conceive the child . It is thought Galina may be the oldest woman in Russia to ever give birth. However, the oldest woman in the world to give birth was Omkari Singh, who gave birth to twins aged 70 iIn 2008. In 2013, she revealed she was struggling to raise the boys, due to her age. Britain's oldest mother is Elizabeth Adeney, who gave birth to a boy in 2009 when she was 66.","Galina Hrustaev gave birth to Cleopatra by Cesarean section in Moscow .

"If you find yourself constantly fiddling with your phone and checking for updates, you may be trying to alter your mood, a new study claims. People who can’t put down their mobile phones are more prone to moodiness and temperamental behaviour, according to researchers. They have found a link between phone addiction and emotional instability, as well as a reduced ability to focus on the task at hand. People who can’t put down their mobile phones (illustrated with a stock image) are more prone to moodiness and temperamental behaviour, according to a new study . Scientists from Baylor University in Waco, Texas, said that individuals who relentlessly check their phone may be trying to improve how they feel emotionally. ‘A person who is moody and temperamental may be more likely to be addicted to their cell phone than more stable individuals,’ they wrote in the journal Personality and Individual Differences. ‘Much like a variety of substance addictions, cell phone addiction may be an attempt at mood repair. ‘Incessant checking of emails, sending texts, tweeting, and surfing the web may act as pacifiers for the unstable individual distracting him or herself from the worries of the day and providing solace, albeit temporarily, from such concerns.’ Scientists from Baylor University in Waco, Texas, said that individuals who relentlessly check their phone (illustrated with a stock image) may be trying to improve how they feel emotionally . The average smartphone user looks at their handset around 150 times a day. But an iOS app called Moment can monitor phone usage to track how much an individual uses their phone and where. It automatically tracks how much a person uses their phone every day. If they are using it too much, individuals can set daily limits to receive a notification when they have spent too long on their handset. They can also receive reminders when they reach 50 per cent of their allotted time. The app was invented by Kevin Holesh, who said: 'I find myself ignoring my family and friends in favour of my iPhone. '’Sometimes that’s okay... but I really should be concentrating on the present moment and the people I love around me'. For the study, the researchers recruited 346 men and women between the ages of 19 to 24, and with an average age of 21. They assessed the volunteers' personalities and level of mobile phone addiction by analysing their answers to a detailed questionnaire. As well as emotional instability, the researchers found that ‘attention impulsiveness’ - defined as a person’s inability to concentrate on the topic at hand - had a significant link with mobile phone addiction. They also discovered that quieter, more introverted people were less likely to be hooked on their technology than more outgoing individuals. ‘Those who express feelings of shyness and bashfulness may be less likely to become dependent on their cell phones than their more extroverted counterparts,’ they said. Another study by the same university, which was published last year, found that 60 per cent of students felt agitated if they couldn’t access their phone. On average, the students spent 95 minutes a day texting, 49 minutes emailing and 39 minutes checking Facebook on their phone. Some were spending ten hours a day on them, the study revealed.","Scientists from Baylor University, Texas, said that people who relentlessly check their phone may be trying to improve how they feel .

"A stunning Georgian townhouse which was once the home of romantic British poet Lord Byron is to be restored to its former glory – a £45million eight-bedroom mansion. The Grade II-listed building, which is called No.139 Piccadilly and is situated in London's Mayfair, was home to Lord Byron in 1815 and it was where he wrote some of his famous works including Parisina and The Siege of Corinth. However, in the 20th Century the elegant townhouse was converted into office space and original fittings were replaced with modern décor. Now, after years of being used by office workers, the building is to be transformed back to its original state, with the addition of a swimming pool, sauna, gym, roof terrace and staff quarters. The Grade II-listed building, which is called No.139 Piccadilly and situated in London's Mayfair, was home to Lord Byron and was where he wrote some of his famous works including Parisina and The Siege of Corinth . In the 20th Century, the elegant townhouse was converted into office space and original fittings were replaced with modern décor. It will now be converted back into an eight-bedroom £45million mansion . The project will be carried out by billionaire property investors David and Simon Reuben, who already have an impressive property portfolio across the capital, including five office and residential properties in Mayfair and Battersea Heliport. The brothers, who were born in Bombay, have a fortune of more than £7billion and are among the top 10 richest people in the UK. Westminster City Council approved the conversion and granted planning permission on the condition that the brothers pay £500,000 towards the council's affordable housing fund. As well as the instalment of a swimming pool and gymnasium, the works will also see the building extended to a total of 17,800 square feet. Daniel Smith, of Motcomb, who is an architecture working on the conversion, told The Telegraph: 'There are some magnificent rooms there. We will be undertaking a careful, considered, scholarly restoration of the interior and exterior.' The property (left) has been bought by billionaire property investors David and Simon Reuben (pictured right) The property has had a host of famous owners, most notably Lord Byron and the Duke of Queensberry. Lord Byron, who became an overnight star thanks to his lengthy poem, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, lived in the property in 1815 when he married and later separated from Annabella Milbanke, with whom he had a daughter. Following the split, and Lady Byron running off with their child, he wrote: 'The moment that my wife left me I was assailed by all the falsehoods that malice could invent or slander publish; ... there was no crime too dark to be attributed to me by the moral (?) English, to account for so common an occurrence as a 'separation in high life.' Inside the property is a grand marble staircase, leading to to the first floor (left) while a huge skylight allows the sun to shine through on a bright day (right) The house was given modern-decor in the 20th century but retained some features such as the fireplace (left) and the detailing around the doors (right) The house still has Georgian detailing around door frames but it is due to be restored to its full former glory . 'I was thought a devil, because Lady Byron was allowed to be an angel!' In 1816, less than a year after the split and amid rumours surrounding his suspected relationship with half-sister Augusta, the poet fled England and never returned. No. 139 Piccadilly was later owned by the Duke of Queensberry, who was better known by his nickname 'Old Q.' It is believed that he used to sit on a balcony of the property and watch women as they passed by. Lord Byron was an English romantic poet . Lord Byron, born George Gordon Noel in 1788, was an English romantic poet who wrote some of the most famous works in history. The sixth Baron Byron, born in London – who inherited his title at just three-years-old, when his father died – shot to fame almost overnight in 1812 when his lengthy narrative of 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' was published. Lord Byron, who spent his early years in Aberdeen, attended Harrow School and Cambridge University before spending two years travelling around the Mediterranean in 1809. He returned to England two years later and it was within 12 months that the first two parts of 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' were released – making his name. Following his fame, more of his works were published including The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos (1813), Parisina and The Siege of Corinth (1815). The poet's life was not without controversy, however, and in 1814 his half-sister Augusta gave birth to a daughter – rumoured to be his. He also indulged in an affair with Lady Caroline Lamb, who famously called him 'mad, bad and dangerous to know'. A year later he married Annabella Milbanke, with whom he had a daughter, but the couple split in 1816. The same year, following the separation, rumours surrounding his suspected relationship with half-sister Augusta and amid claims of debt, Lord Byron fled England and never returned. He travelled to Belgium and then on to Switzerland before moving on to Italy, where he lived for more than six years. During his time in Venice, he wrote some of his most notable works, including 'Don Juan' (1819-1824), but was also plagued by rumours of several affairs. Mary Shelley, with whom he shared a house in Italy for a time, was said to be appalled at his behaviour, after he worked his way through countesses, chambermaids and aristocrats' or cobblers' wives. After his time in Italy, Lord Byron chose to move to Greece, where he joined insurgents fighting against the Ottoman Empire. He paid for the refitting of the Greek fleet and refunded part of the ragged revolutionary army after arriving in Greece in 1823. Lord Byron was eventually buried  near to his ancestral home – Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire (above) He died a year later of pneumonia in Messolonghi in western Greece, where a cenotaph is said to contain his heart. His support for the Greek cause helped inspire young men from Britain, Italy and the United States to join the uprising. Greece won its war of independence in 1832 following the intervention of the Great powers: Britain, France and Russia. Though Byron enjoyed hero status in Greece, he was shunned in Britain. Westminster Abbey in London refused to bury his remains in its Poets' Corner because of his Bohemian lifestyle. His body was instead buried near to his ancestral home – Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire. In 1938, the vicar of Hucknall, worried by persistent rumours that Lord Byron's grave in Hucknall churchyard in Nottinghamshire was empty, gained permission to open it. Inside he found Byron's perfectly embalmed body.","Former London home of romantic British poet Lord Byron to be converted .

"The Health and Human Services Department will launch a special enrollment period for an estimated six million people who did not sign up for health care insurance coverage by the 2015 deadline, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services said Friday. 'We recognize that this is the first tax filing season where consumers may have to pay a fee or claim an exemption for not having health insurance coverage,' Marilyn Tavenner, CMS' administrator, said Friday in a statement. CMS is the division of the the Health and Human Services Department that is overseeing Obamacare. Earlier this week HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell indicated that her department could authorize the extension and would make a decision 'quickly.' Democratic lawmakers and their allies had been lobbying HHS to give Americans without healthcare insurance until the end of the April tax season to submit their applications, arguing that many are unaware of the consequences of not signing up. Obamacare enrollees receive assistance applying for medical coverage at a health insurance marketplace enrollment center in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, which was to be the last day to sign up for 2015 coverage under the Affordable Care Act, until the Health and Human Services department delayed the deadline twice this week . HHSsaid Monday it would give Americans who were 'in line' to enroll when the application process ended on Sunday another week to sign up.  On Friday it said it would launch a special enrollment period for the estimated six million people who did not sign up for health care insurance coverage by the Feb. 15 deadline because they weren't aware of the fees . 'We're going to analyze it, we're going to think about it,and we'll be back,' Burwell told reporters on Wednesday. For the 2014 tax year, residents without health insurance will have to pay $95 to get out of the requirement, or 1 percent of their income, when they file their returns. The fine will increase to the greater of $395 or 2 percent of a household's income next year at filing time for anyone who missed the open enrollment period this month. 'Millions upon millions of people are unaware about these penalties,' Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a left-aligned group that advocated for Obamacare, said Wednesday, per the Hill. HHS had already extended the deadline to enroll for approximately 150,000 people 'in line' to sign up but were prevented from completing their applications by a computer glitch or long wait times at call centers last weekend. Those enrollees will have until Feb. 22 to fill out their forms, it said Monday. Today it said it would reopen the federal health exchange from March 15 - April 30 for consumers who pay the fine in 2014 and submit that they only became aware of fees levied on taxpayers without health care when they filed their taxes this year. Some states had postponed the close of the their own marketplaces for a variety of reasons, and several others had indicated that they are considering the authorization of a special enrollment period that would extend until the end of April. Vermont, Washington and Minnesota have announced grace periods. California, New York and Kentucky indicated they may do the same. Congressional Democrats said all Americans should be afforded the opportunity to sign up for Obamcare late, and they urged HHS this week to grant their request for a nationwide special enrollment period. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and nine other Democratic senators sent a letter to the administration asking for leniency while House Democrats  Sandy Levin of Michigan, the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, Jim McDermott of Washington and Lloyd Doggett of Texas co-authored another. Asked about the extension today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called it a 'pretty novel solution to this challenge.' Instead of paying a fee, millions of Americans will now have the opportunity to make sure their money is going to a good place - protecting themselves and their families with health care insurance. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia  Burwell said Wednesday there was a possibility HHS would authorize a special enrollment period on Wednesday . The Treasury Department in January estimated that as many as six million Americans without health coverage would not meet the government-mandated Feb. 15 to sign up for Obamacare. That was before HHS announced on Tuesday that it had vastly exceeded its own expectations and signed up 11.4 million Americans for health insurance from Nov. 15 through Sunday. 'Sunday, February 15 was the biggest enrollment day ever: more new consumers signed up for health coverage than on any day this open enrollment period or the last,' the White House said in a statement, noting that one million Americans enrolled in the final nine days. HHS had predicted that 9.9 million people would meet the deadline. The Congressional Budget Office was far more aggressive with its assessment. The non-partisan agency said it expected 13 million Americans to come forward in that amount of time. If HHS reopens the federal exchange, it could reach that mark.","The end of the open enrollment period was Feb. 15 - anyone without out health insurance who didn't sign up was to be slapped with a tax next year .

"Tottenham have stepped up their interest in West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino after shelving a move for Jay Rodriguez. Spurs have now made initial enquiries over a January switch for the striker, who is rated at £25million. Southampton forward Rodriguez remains a priority transfer target for Mauricio Pochettino, but the delay in his return from a knee injury has forced Spurs into re-assessing their January plans. VIDEO Scroll down to see Berahino score an outrageous volley in England U21 training . Saido Berahino has scored 8 goals for West Brom already this season, attracting Tottenham's interest . The young striker earned a first England call-up with his impressive form for his club . And Berahino is emerging as Tottenham's No 1 target when the transfer wind re-opens next week. Spurs will be one of the most active clubs next month with players moving in and out of north London. Five months into the new season, Pochettino remains unconvinced by a number of the stars he inherited when he arrived from Southampton in the summer. And the Argentine is determined to take serious steps towards revamping his squad next month. The Argentine and his backroom team have been busy using their contacts in Spain to identify potential targets in January. Espanyol defender Hector Moreno is player that is interesting Pochettino. Mauricio Pochettino is looking to bolster his striking options, and is not satisfied with the squad he inherited . Spurs had been looking at Jay Rodriguez, who has not played this season due to a serious knee injury . The Spurs manager worked with the Mexico international during his time in charge at Espanyol and is keen on a reunion. Pochettino has been keeping close tabs on Moreno's progress as he comes back from a broken leg. Spurs' Spain-based scouts are also keeping tabs on Barcelona youngsters Sergi Samper and Adama Traore. However, Tottenham will be just as busy trying to offload those that Pochettino has identified as not having a role in his long-term plans. Rodriguez was in fine form last season, and looked in line for a World Cup call-up before his injury . Pochettino has had to rely on the likes of young striker Harry Kane for goals so far this season . The club will listen to offers for Paulinho, Vlad Chiriches, Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend next month. Likewise, the futures of Emmanuel Adebayor, Moussa Dembele and Jan Vertonghen are also unclear going into the January window. Funds will be made available to Pochettino in January, but he knows he must sell members of the current squad in order to fulfil his vision for the squad.","West Brom striker Saido Berahino is rated at around £25million .

"Manchester City face Bayern Munich on Tuesday evening in a Champions League tie they simply can't lose. Yet despite the appeal of the reigning champions of Germany and the 2013 competition winners, not to mention the importance of the game in the context of City's season, tickets are still available ahead of kick-off. Bayern supporter and blogger Felix Haselsteiner says this situation would be unthinkable in Germany, where the fan is treated with far greater respect. It’s all about the quality. Floodlights, Champions League, Bundesliga winners versus Premier League champions. It’s a scenario every football fan should be eager to experience live. Yet Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium will not be sold out on Tuesday night when Bayern Munich roll into town - an unimaginable scenario from a German perspective. The Etihad Stadium will host Tuesday's Champions League clash between English champions Manchester City and German giants Bayern Munich - but seats remain available in the hours leading up to kick-off . Manchester City fans in full voice at the Etihad - but are they getting a raw deal from the club? City's website showed a number of seats still available for the must-win Bayern match . Bayern celebrate scoring in front of another full house at the Allianz Arena against Hoffenheim on Saturday . Felix writes for the Mia San Rot blog here . Since Bayern Munich moved to the Allianz Arena in 2005 only a handful of games have not been in front of a full stadium. The main reason? The club provides something for everyone. On the one hand, there is a huge amount of business seats, with cosy blankets and smoked salmon during half-time. These are fully booked by mid-size companies or people who want to enjoy Europe’s best football team without freezing. But on the other hand, as a club member you can easily receive tickets for the Kurve. It is here that the ‘magnificent atmosphere’ which Xabi Alonso has praised is created. For a Champions League game, you would pay €30 (£23). Football fans from Germany simply cannot understand the British stadium and ticket policy. Manchester City’s cheapest season ticket costs €40 (£32) more than the second-best category ticket in Munich. No wonder the difference in terms of stadium atmosphere is so marked. Bayern fans will descend on the Etihad Stadium for the second consecutive season on Tuesday night . VIDEO Aguero and Jovetic fit for Bayern showdown . Bayern fans show their colours on their visit to the Etihad Stadium in last season's Champions League . Travelling Bayern fans hang their banners at Old Trafford ahead of last season's quarter-finals . Xabi Alonso, who joined in the summer, has praised the Allianz Arena atmosphere . In the Allianz Arena, nobody expects a suit and tie businessman to be cheering loudly for ‘his’ team, this is done by the fans in the Kurve. But if only a certain clientele of people can afford a stadium visit, there simply aren’t enough people to cheer the team on. The true British football fan can be found in the pub, where the atmosphere is much better in England than in Germany, but in the stadiums it is the other way around. The Premier League often refers to its high average of stadium visitors, but it is not about quantity, it’s about quality. Twenty-five years after Hillsborough it may also be the point to admit that safe standing needs to be reintroduced. In nearly every football league worldwide there are no more worries about the safety of terraces. The FA and UEFA are birds of a feather when it comes to all-seater stadiums, and it is no wonder that clubs like City suffer as a result. Bayern's perennial success means getting a ticket for one of their matches is incredibly difficult . Arjen Robben helped Bayern Munich lift the European Cup in 2013 and they are desperate to repeat the feat . This is the main problem of commercialised modern football: There is no demand for football fans who stand, cheer and push the team to the limits. Club executives don’t care as long as everybody wears the new £100 team shirt and consumes enough food and drink. German chairmen also love the revenue, of course, but not for the high price of selling the club’s identity. From an economical point of view, simply looking at numbers and figures, the Bundesliga should see the Premier League as a role model. In terms of international marketing or TV revenues Barclays’ advertisement league is miles ahead. In terms of what makes a visit to the stadium worth watching, though, the Premier League can be jealous of the Bundesliga. Why else would the City fans not be filling their home ground tonight?

"The shoes that former Patriots player Aaron Hernandez was wearing when he allegedly murdered Odin Lloyd have mysteriously disappeared, it has been claimed. Investigators  seized four pairs of white, size-13 Nike sneakers from the master bedroom of Hernandez's North Attleboro, Massachusetts mansion on June 18, 2013 - a day after Lloyd was found with six gunshot wounds on wasteland a mile away. Police also later returned to search the home on June 22. Three other pairs of shoes, including a set of Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Lows, were photographed in Hernandez's basement 'man cave' but were not taken into evidence. Prosecutors claim that the sole of the Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Low brand sneaker is similar to an unidentified shoe impression found near Lloyd's body. The Retro Lows had gone on sale just three weeks before the murder. Aaron Hernandez, 25, (pictured right in court on Thursday) had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges in 2013 after the death of Odin Lloyd (left). The Pats cut him hours later . According to a search warrant affidavit, it wasn't until almost 18 months later that investigators noticed the three pairs of shoes in photographs as they prepared to go to trial. However when they returned to the mansion to look for them, they had disappeared. Jurors have not yet been told that the three other pairs of shoes found in the basement were overlooked. University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McMann, who has been following the trial, told CNN: 'Jurors will wonder why didn't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from Hernandez's home.' Jurors were this week shown evidence photographs from Hernandez's home in June 2013 - including pairs of sneakers neatly lined up against a wall. However these shoes were not taken into evidence . He added: 'If jurors determine investigators and prosecutors simply made a mistake in not seizing the shoes, it could damage the jurors' confidence in the case. Odin Lloyd's body was found at the industrial park around a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro. Lloyd had been dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna. The medical examiner found 27-year-old Lloyd had been shot once in the back and six times in the front with the final two bullets fired as he lay face up. Prosecutors claim Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home in the early hours of June 17, 2013, before driving him to the industrial park where his body was found later that day. Wallace and Ortiz have also been charged with murder and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said security video from the cameras in Hernandez's home show him arriving with a gun hours before going to pick up Lloyd, and later revealed the Pats star, Ortiz and Wallace carrying items from the basement to the trunk of a rental car. Hernandez's basement 'man cave' features a bar, screening room, trophy room and pool table complete with a New England Patriot's logo. Earlier in the trial, Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna, told how Lloyd and Hernandez would sometimes hole up there and smoke marijuana. A set of Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Lows (stock image) were found at Hernandez's home and photographed by investigators but not taken into evidence. They later disappeared . Bolt hole: A court photograph shows the bar area of Hernandez's man cave in the basement of his North Attleboro mansion in Massachusetts . On Wednesday, Massachusetts State Troopers testified that a safe found in the closet of Hernandez's master bedroom contained a digital scale and a dish with marijuana residue. A marijuana cigarette found near Lloyd's body contained traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, potentially placing both at the scene, Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg has said. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges. The team cut him hours later. If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. The former NFL star will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. On Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not call to the stand Hernandez's high school friend Robert Paradis. Paradis testified when the jury was out of the courtroom that he had visited Hernandez in April 2013 at his condo in Los Angeles. He said Hernandez told him he kept 'fire' or 'heat' under the seat of his car and indicated it was a .45-caliber weapon, the same as the murder weapon, which has never been found. Paradis said that after Hernandez left the condo, Hernandez called back to ask him to check whether he had left 'it' in his bedroom. Paradis opened a drawer, saw a black shirt wrapped around an object and lifted it up but never opened it. He said it felt like a gun.

"Friendly doctors are 'bad for their patients' health', researchers have warned as a new study revealed two thirds of young medics struggle to be truthful with patients they like. Blurring the lines between social and professional relationships can impact on the level of care offered and prevent patients from being honest about important side effects. Doctors should refrain from adding patients as friends on Facebook, they should not hug or allow patients to call them by their first names, regulators have warned. They said those who breach the boundaries could face disciplinary action. It comes as a survey of 338 oncologists under the age of 40, published in The Lancet Oncology, found 59 per cent said they found it difficult to tell the truth to those patients they liked. Two thirds of young doctors struggle to be truthful with those patients they are friendly with, a new survey published in The Lancet Oncology found. Medics have been warned not to hug patients or allow them to use their first names. (File picture) Sixty per cent of respondents said if doctors felt too close to their patients, it could prevent them from making objective decisions about a person's care, the Times reported. Lesley Fallowfield, of Brighton and Sussex Medical School, said: 'Oncology is a specialty that can be enormously rewarding but is fraught with many challenges. 'Young oncologists have to master dealing with anxious patients who are facing a life-threatening disease; conveying the true prognosis; discussing the complexity of modern treatments; and explaining the unavailability of some drugs, the side-effects of treatment, and likely therapeutic aims.' But she said for those doctors who have entered the profession in the age of the 'cyber world', are more likely to fall victim to blurring the professional boundaries with patients. She said: 'The difficulty, if you hug and kiss patients, if you allow them to call you by your first name, is that quickly the relationship can become confused as a social one rather than a professional one. 'Doctors become confused, ""I really like this person, how can I bear to tell them that they're going to die?"" 'They find it more difficult to be objective.' Professor Fallowfield said while doctors can find it harder to be truthful, and break bad news to patients, blurring the professional lines can impact on the patient's  behaviour too. Regulators have warned those doctors who breach professional boundaries with patients in person or on social media, will face disciplinary action . She said those being treated can 'feel intimidated about complaining', or fail to raise issues regarding unpleasant side effects of treatment, which could prove vitally important. The study found half of doctors questioned had given patients their personal mobile numbers, a fifth had accepted social invitations from patients and 14 per cent had accepted them as friends on Facebook. A spokesman for the General Medical Council, which regulates doctors, said: 'The rise in the use of social media also brings new challenges and doctors must consider the risks involved and the impact it could have on the relationship with their patients. 'Our guidance explains that the standards expected of doctors do not change because they are communicating through social media rather than face-to-face.'","Study published in The Lancet Oncology found two-thirds of doctors under the age of 40 struggle to be truthful with those patients they like .

"Tragic: Anita Fox, 72, was found dead at a house where she worked on September 23, 2014, in Colleyville, Texas. She is believed to have been targeted for her $1m life insurance policy . A father and son allegedly murdered a 72-year-old housekeeper to get their hands on a $1million insurance policy she didn't even know she had. Gerard Gorman, 48, and his son Bernard Gorman, 26, are accused of stalking Anita Fox for days in September before finding the time and place to kill her in Colleyville, Texas. It was the first homicide in the small town for more than 20 years. She was employed by the owners of the house, who were away at the time of the gruesome incident. Earlier this week, it was alleged the pair had been funneling $700 a month to maintain the policy, but it isn't known whether they knew their victim. The father was found dead in a Houston hotel room from natural causes last month. His son however was arrested in Florida on Wednesday. According to the Star-Telegram, the pair became suspects after police received a tip about a pickup truck they thought was suspicious. The younger Gorman was arrested on October 4 on an unrelated traffic charge. He told police he gave the truck to his father so he could drive to Oklahama, according to a police affidavit. He said he accidentally left his cellphone in the car. However, according to documents, they found a text message sent from Bernard Gorman's phone Sept. 21 that read, 'Sorry I can't talk me and him is in half murders.' Bernard Gorman told officers he used those words to describe an argument with his father. His story is believed to have unraveled when transmissions from a cell phone tower revealed he was in the area around the time of her death. According to the paper, officers also found internet searches for 'Anita Fox, Forth Worth' on the device. Three months later he was interviewed again and admitted he had lied during the first meeting. He then described how his father went inside the house and returned with blood on his arm. He then described how they drove to a gas station so they could then change his shirt. Suspects: Gerard Gorman, 48, (left) and his son Bernard Gorman, 26, are accused of stalking Anita Fox for days in September before finding the time and place to kill her . Police Chief Michael Holder told the Star-Telegram : 'Their motive is greed.'We were able to get a license plate on the vehicle, and we were able to track the vehicle to the Houston area. This is one of the most complex cases I have ever been involved in. 'It is believed that they followed her for a few days to determine her habits and the right time to carry out the murder. Police records show Gerard Gorman went into the house while Bernard Gorman waited in the car. The pair have a limited criminal record and police. The FBI and the U.S. District Attorney are now involved in the insurance fraud investigation, which could potentially involve more people and span across state lines.

"A Florida man has been sentenced to three and a half years in a Colorado prison for selling a dangerous synthetic weed that 'was not meant for human consumption' and had not been properly tested under racy names like 'Sexy Monkey'. Daniel Bernier, 28, was one of nine people charged over manufacturing, marketing and distributing the drug that has come to be known as 'Spice'. Prosecutors said Bernier imported chemicals from China and then sprayed them onto leaves. He then packaged the product with a warning label saying it should not be consumed, but called the drug different provocative names, including Sexy Monkey, and targeted young people when selling, The Denver Post reported. Busted: The synthetic weed, marketed with names such as 'Sexy Monkey' but better known as 'Spice', was made using imported chemicals from China that were sprayed on leaves . 'Nobody knew what the effect of these chemicals would be other than it would make people high,' Federal prosecutor Jaime Peña said. At least 221 people were admitted to hospital in Denver and Colorado Springs - just in August and September of 2013 - after using Spice. The drug became known to cause powerful hallucinations, with one man trying to decaptiate himself. Another user tried to set themselves on fire. One 15-year-old boy died. U.S. District Judge Philip Brimmer denied a move by Bernier's lawyers to reduce his sentence. Bernier provided details to police over how his syndicate worked and explained how much money he lost - over $1.8 million - when the operation went bust, The Denver Post reported. He even apologized to the judge. 'My actions were ignorant,' he said. 'They were reckless.' However the judge did not budge. He said the the 'big picture' was that Bernier knew his product was not ready for consumption but continued to sell it in the name of money. 'That was fire Mr. Bernier was willing to play with,' the judge said. Bernier received the three and a half year jail sentence, along with three years probation on top of it. Four of the nine people allegedly involved in the syndicate have entered guilty pleas.","Daniel Bernier, 28, of Cape Canaveral, Florida, sentenced Wednesday .

"A 19-year-old Sydney siege survivor has pleaded guilty to aggravated break and enter charges in a courtroom on Friday. Lindt café worker Jarrod Morton-Hoffman was praised for his bravery and leadership qualities during the 17 hour ordeal in Martin Place on December 15. But on Friday, the teenager faced the Sydney District Court for a robbery offence he committed about six months before the traumatic event with two friends, Nine News reports. Mr Morton-Hoffman is alleged to have stolen $1000 worth of American Apparel clothing from one of the chain's stores in the Sydney CBD, according to News Corp. The case has been adjourned to a later date. Scroll down for video . Jarrod Morton-Hoffman pleaded guilty to aggravated break and enter charges at Sydney's District Court on Friday . Earlier this month the teenager told 60 Minutes how he and co-worked Joel Herat had secretly armed themselves with kitchen knives, hoping for a moment to be able to attack gunman Man Haron Monis. 'I've got this knife in my pocket and I know Joel has a knife in his pocket,' Mr Morton-Hoffman said. But the duo quickly decided against an attack, in fear that it could lead to fatal consequences for pregnant lawyer Julie Taylor. 'We are so close we could do this but you know someone would need to jump, hold his arms down and then I would stab him in the jugular,' he said.

Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, the 19-year-old also revealed he refused to budge until the very end, disturbed by the threats made by Monis.

"Never-before-seen FBI footage has revealed the harrowing rescue of 16-year-old kidnap victim Hannah Anderson following a week-long manhunt. The FBI revealed to ABC News how they tracked down the California teenager to Idaho backcountry and saved her amid a shootout with her kidnapper, James DiMaggio, in August 2013. ABC has also learned that since the terrifying ordeal, Hannah has returned to high school, where she is an honor student, and now hopes to become a detective. The search for Hannah began on August 4, 2013 after her mother, Christina, 44, and eight-year-old brother, Ethan, were found burned beyond recognition in DiMaggio's Boulevard home. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Two people - one at the top of the circle and one towards the right hand side - can be seen walking near a campsite in Idaho. The FBI identified the duo as Hannah Anderson and her kidnapper . Spotted: The never-before-seen footage shows the campsite where they were hiding out in August 2013 . Saved: An FBI agent, the left figure, grabs the hand of Hannah, right, after a team swooped in to save her . DiMaggio, a 40-year-old family friend, then collected Hannah from cheerleading practice and fled the state. Friends said that he had a crush on Hannah that had made her uncomfortable. Authorities issued an Amber Alert but had little to go on because neither was carrying a cell phone that could be tracked. But after a week of searching, a group horsebacking riding through an area of Idaho backcountry known as the River of No Return Wilderness contacted the county sheriff to report that they had seen a man, a teenage girl in pajamas and a grey cat camping in the forest. The FBI knew that DiMaggio had a grey cat. On August 9, another hiker told police that they had seen the duo setting up a camp at Morehead Lake and the next day, the U.S. Marshals Service used a small plane to search the area. Kidnap: Hannah Anderson, right, was kidnapped by family friend James DiMaggio, left, after he killed her mother and eight-year-old brother in August 2013. Friends say they believe he had a crush on her . Campsite: FBI photographs show the campsite where DiMaggio had been hiding Hannah. Investigators learned that he had bought the camping equipment in the days before the murders and kidnap . Hideout: DiMaggio and Hannah were spotted by horseback riders who thought they did not have appropriate camping gear. Hannah was wearing her pajamas and neither had hiking boots or rain jackets . Safe: People who had seen the duo also said they had a grey cat with them, which confirmed their identities to the FBI, who knew DiMaggio had a grey cat. The animal was unharmed and returned to DiMaggio's family . 'We circled a few more times and focused in on that area. And then we were able to see that it was a blue tent,' U.S. Marshal Steve Jurman told ABC News. Then they spotted two people with a small animal. An FBI plane took off and confirmed the animal was indeed a grey cat. At that point, the FBI launched two hostage rescue teams to reach Hannah - and as they headed towards her, they spotted her waving her hands in the air while DiMaggio collected firewood. 'Stealth was key,' said James Yacone of the FBI. 'One of the requirements to move in on the arrest was a distance and a separation between Hannah and DiMaggio.' So later, with DiMaggio again busy in the woods, they swooped in - with two agents running towards the teenager and leading her away from the campsite. DiMaggio fired at least once, the FBI said, and the team returned fire - firing multiple times and ultimately killing him. Weapons: The FBI, who said DiMaggio had fired the first shot before they fatally shot him, found these guns . Chilling: Authorities also found a machete, pictured left, and handcuffs, right, at the campsite . Photos taken at the campsite show that DiMaggio had a stash of weapons, including firearms and a machete, as well as handcuffs. It also emerged that neither had a rain jacket or hiking boots with them, and Hannah was wearing pajama pants and tennis shoes when she was first seen. After they took Hannah away from the scene, she was taken to hospital - where she learned that her mother and brother had been killed. When agents took the unharmed grey cat to her, she did not want to take it, and it was returned to DiMaggio's family. Investigators say they believe DiMaggio was motivated to murder Hannah's family and kidnap her because he hoped for a relationship with the girl, but feared she was growing away from him. 'Somewhere in his mind, I think he thought that he and Hannah would have a relationship and she would somehow fall in love with him,' FBI Deputy Director Britt Johnson said. 'I think the ability for him to get her away and take her somewhere - he somehow thought he could change the situation.' Loss: Hannah holds up a picture of her mother Christina, 44, and her eight-year-old brother Ethan at their memorial service in California in 2013. They were found burned beyond recognition in DiMaggio's home . Burned down: After burning his house to the ground with their bodies inside, DiMaggio kidnapped Hannah . New life: She is now living with her father, Brett, right, and hopes to become a detective . Friends also speculated that DiMaggio's behavior may have been sparked by the upcoming anniversary of his father's death, who had taken his life by taking meth and walking into the desert. After the ordeal, Hannah moved in with her father, Brett, and returned to school, where she is on the honor roll, according to a family spokesperson. 'She is exploring colleges now where she plans to study forensics and criminology with a goal of becoming a detective with a Special Victims Unit,' they said in a statement. 'The entire Anderson family is eternally grateful to all of the individuals who helped rescue Hannah, and especially to the good men and women of the FBI who have clearly influenced her career aspirations.'

"Ruth Shirey, who taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, died after being assaulted in her home on Friday allegedly by her own son . A 36-year-old man has been taken into custody after he allegedly fatally attacked his retired university professor mother. Ruth Shirey, who taught at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, died after being assaulted in her home on Friday morning. Ms Shirey died at a local hospital. She was found in the bathroom of her home with head and facial injuries. A 911 call was made at 3am on Friday from a man who told the dispatcher that a woman was injured at the home. Her son, Todd Walters was found at her home in Indiana, Pennsylvania and taken into custody. Walters is charged with criminal homicide and aggravated assault. Her neighbor, Dan Broadbent, told WTAE: 'She was a very, very nice lady. She was a retired geography professor from IUP and just very active in the community and politics. She was a very, very good lady. 'That's very startling because we had never heard any violence or any domestic disturbances from that house, that area, in a long, long time. It's very disturbing.' According to reports, Walters would stay at the home from time to time. The professor's ex-husband, Royce Walters, was interviewed by police following her death and said that his son had psychological problems and was off his medication. Mr Walters said the last time he saw his son he threatened to punch him. University staff were informed of Ms Shirey's death on Friday morning. Her university biography lists her many academic successes. She obtained a Ph.D in geography in 1970 from the University of Tennessee before joining Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1970. In 1988, she participated in a Fulbright faculty exchange with the University of Poona in India. She had authored several books and many articles, along with winning numerous awards for excellence in the geography field.

"A World War II veteran has been reunited with a tear-jerking love letter he sent to his late wife before they married 70 years ago. Bill Moore, 90, of Aurora, Colorado, wrote the heartfelt note to Bernadean Gibson while he was serving in Europe. He fondly described her as 'lovable' and 'alluring' and himself as the 'luckiest guy alive.' Over the years the letter - dated December 29, 1944 - went astray but a woman discovered it inside a record sleeve purchased from a thrift shop  and set out  to get it back to its rightful owner. An emotional Moore was filmed by ABC News as he read aloud the handwritten message he penned when he was 20 years old. Scroll down for video . Emotional moment: A World War II veteran has been reunited with a tear-jerking love letter he sent to his late wife before they married 70 years ago . Flashback: Bill Moore from Aurora, Colorado, wrote the heartfelt note to Bernadean Gibson while he was serving in Europe. He fondly described her as 'lovable' and 'alluring' and himself as the 'luckiest guy alive.' Original manuscript: Moore was filmed by ABC News as he read back the handwritten message he penned when he was 20 years old . 'My darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean,' the letter begins. Moore then jokes he could have written a lot more adjectives to describe his sweetheart but 'ran out of space.' The script continues: 'You are so lovely, darling, that I often wonder how it is possible that you are mine. 'I'm really the luckiest guy in the world, you know. And you are the reason, Bernadean. Even your name sounds lovely to me. 'It's just when I get so horribly, terribly lonely for you that I write letters like this. I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you.' Young Loves: Bill and Bernadean Moore were married for 63 years and when Bill fought in World War II he sent florid love notes to Bernadean who was a high-school student in Kansas . Longtime loves: Moore's wife passed away in April 2010 . Moore said he knew he wanted Gibson of Fredonia, Kansas, to be his wife after being torn apart by the war. He met her while she was still in high school. When Moore returned to the U.S. he went on to marry Gibson and have three children. The couple remained together for 63 years before Gibson passed away in April 2010. After her death, Moore moved to an assisted-care facility for veterans and sold many of his possessions. It's thought that's how his love letter ended up in a thrift store. Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in all my life as I am for you,' concludes the letter . Army man: When Moore returned to the U.S. he went on to marry Gibson and have three children . Ilene Ortiz of Westminster found in in the sleeve of a record she bought and contacted ABC affiliate KMGH for help in finding the subjects. Moore's daughter, Melinda Gale, 48, suspects her mother may have slipped the message into the record for safe keeping because it was special to her. She described its discovery as a 'wonderful gift' that reminds her of the very special bond her parents had. Moore says he misses his wife terribly and she is always on his mind. Through tears, he concluded: 'It's difficult talking out loud about it to other people. 'But I loved her, and she loved me. That's all I can tell you. It’s a heartache not being with her all the time.'","Bill Moore from Aurora, Colorado, wrote the heartfelt note to Bernadean Gibson while he was serving in Europe .

"A Liberal Democrat donor has angered his neighbours with plans for a two-storey basement under his £20m house in Belgravia. Bhanu Choudhrie, who with his father Sudhir Choudri has given more than £1million to the political party, was given the green light for his extensive plans last week. They include a huge subterranean leisure complex with its own cinema and pool, as well as steam, sauna and treatment rooms- all accessed by a lift. Bhanu Choudhrie, pictured with wife Simrin, has angered his neighbours with plans for a two-storey basement under his £20m house in Belgravia . A conservatory at the rear will also be demolished and replaced with a dining room, family room and roof terrace overlooking the mews home, which houses two employees and a gym. The decision comes just a year after he was arrested by the serious Fraud Office in relation to an inquiry into Rolls-Royce's overseas business practices. Both Mr Choudhrie and his father deny any wrongdoing. But neighbours next to the Grade II listed property are less than pleased about the 'grotesque' plans. While one resident said he feared a nightmare of lorries charging up and down the street as they carried out the work. The planned subterranean extension to Bhanu Choudhrie's Belgravia home  includes a large pool and cinema . A spokesman for the Choudhries said: 'Planning permission has been granted and that's that. As far as the SFO investigation goes they have not been interviewed or talked to again.' The soaring popularity of underground extensions by wealthy home owners has to led claims that diggers are being left entombed across London- because they are cheaper to bury than lift to street level. The New Statesman's Ed Smith claimed that up to 1,000 JCBs- worth around £5 milion- had been buried under some of the capital's most expensive houses. But others have laughed off the claims as 'utterly ludicrous.' Kevin O’Connor, managing director of Cranbrook Basements, said that no professional would leave a digger under any circumstances and there was always an exit strategy for the equipment. Basement extensions several storeys below the ground have become increasingly popular in some of the capital's most expensive neighbourhoods as home-owners attempt to increase their living space without infringing strict planning controls. They have led to the creation of what are known as 'iceberg homes', with the extra space earmarked to accommodate private cinemas, spas and swimming pools. Applications for basement developments in Kensington and Chelsea alone, had soared in numbers- from 46 in 2001 to 450 in 2013- and size, with two and three-storey basements 'not uncommon'. The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber,  Roman Abramovich and Hans Rausing, heir to the Tetra Pak fortune, have all been  said to have sought permission for basement extensions in the capital. But not everyone is a fan with attress Joan Collins expressing outrage last year at her new neighbours in upmarket Belgravia - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes. Neighbours on Chester Square have complained about the 'grotesque' plans with fears they will create noise, dust and construction traffic . The Dynasty actress, 80, told a residents' magazine: 'It's really sad. I find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year.' Queen guitarist Brian May also took umbrage at building work near his Kensington home. Writing online last month he said: 'Kensington used to be a nice quiet decent place to live... now it's becoming a hellhole'. Mr Choudhrie, a CEO at care home company C&C Alpha Group, lives  with his wife Simrin, an interior designer, and their young son. In 2011 Mrs Choudhrie posed as a penniless pregnant woman to appear on Channel 4's Secret Millionaire, in which she donated £100,000 to a centre for vulnerable people in Sheffield. The London borough is to become the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on controversial subterranean developments. Last December, a Government planning inspector gave Kensington and Chelsea council the green light to its proposals to curb the scale of subterranean development. Basement extensions will still be permitted but the new rules  restrict how far they can stretch under a garden, limit them to a single storey in most cases and ban developments under listed buildings altogether. Council cabinet member for planning policy Tim Coleridge had called basements 'the single greatest planning concern'  in living memory. He said many had complained after they had experienced years of misery from noise, vibration, dust and construction traffic. The new guidelines are set to be formally adopted this year.","Bhanu Choudhrie plans  two-storey leisure complex under his £20m home .

"Actor Samuel L. Jackson, who worked as a camera stand-in for Bill Cosby for three years in the 1980s, is the latest celebrity to weigh-in on the sexual assault scandal that continues to engulf the comedian. The Pulp Fiction star said on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Thursday: 'I wish he would say something.' 'Popular opinion would say, ''Where there’s smoke, there’s fire'',' Jackson said, according to philly.com. 'But, I mean, I can’t make a judgment about it. 'I mean, I make my judgments because I have a daughter, I have a wife that I love. 'I have a lot of women in my life, and I know, you know, women are vulnerable to society. 'And people with power take advantage of people.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Samuel L. Jackson, who worked as a camera stand-in for Bill Cosby for three years in the 1980s, said on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Thursday with Meredith Viera: 'People with power take advantage of people.' Under fire: Cosby, 77, has now been accused of sexually assaulting over 30 women . The number of women who have accused Cosby, 77, of sexually assaulting them is now over 30. Cosby has never directly addressed the allegations. His lawyers and spokespeople have denied all accusations. Many of them are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. The abuse charges against Cosby have been bubbling since 2002, however hit fever pitch in November last year when Barbara Bowman, one of Cosby's first accusers, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post, titled 'Bill Cosby raped me. Why did it take 30 years for people to believe my story?' Earlier this week, Cosby thanked fellow comedian Eddie Murphy for not mocking him on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary show. Murphy, who was making his return to SNL for the first time in 30 years, had been asked by writers to play Cosby, but decided against it because 'he didn't want to kick a man when he's down'. 'I am very appreciative of Eddie and I applaud his actions,' Cosby said through his spokesman Thursday. Writers on Saturday Night Live wanted Eddie Murphy, left, to play Bill Cosby during last weekend's 40th anniversary show, however the star refused and the sketch was performed instead by Kenan Thompson, right . A week earlier, two more women accused Cosby . of drugging them decades ago when they met him as . young models, and one said he sexually assaulted her. Linda Brown and Lise-Lotte Lublin came forward as the latest women to bring public accusations against Cosby at . the Los Angeles office of attorney Gloria Allred, who . acknowledged it was too late for them to sue Cosby. Brown told reporters she met Cosby in 1969 in Canada and . went to his hotel suite where he gave her a soft drink that . caused her to black out. She said that when she woke up, she was . naked next to him in bed. 'I couldn't move or speak. I felt paralyzed, he flipped me . over and sexually assaulted me,' Brown said. 'I felt like a rag . doll and like a real-life blow-up doll for him.' Lublin said she met Cosby in 1989 at a hotel in Las Vegas . and that he asked her to perform an improvisation on the pretext . of evaluating her acting. The comedian gave her two alcoholic . drinks that caused her to feel disoriented, she said. Lublin said that a short time later, he embraced her. She . said her memory of the incident was hazy and that she remembered . waking up at her home in the area and not knowing how she got . there. Allred said Brown and Lublin believed Cosby drugged them, . which other women in media interviews have also said happened to . them in encounters with the comedian. In an emotional press conference held on February 12, Linda Brown recounted how in 1969, when she was 21 years old, her modelling agency set her up with Cosby on a dinner date while he was performing in Toronto, reported the New York Daily News. More allegations: Linda Brown (left) and Lise-Lotte Lublin (center) are seen Thursday with their lawyer Glorida Allred (right) givin a press conference about allegedly being assaulted by Bill Cosby decades ago .

Trio: Lublin (far right) pictured with her sister (center) and Bill Cosby in the 80s . Beauties: Lublin (left) and Brown (right) both worked as models decades earlier . The one-time cover girl is best known for being the first model to appear on TV dressed only in a bra in a 1969 Wonderbra commercial. Brown recalled that Cosby showed her pictures of his family over dinner, and then offered to give her a ride home in his limousine. On the way home, the comic allegedly told her he needed to stop by his hotel to pick up a present for someone, and he invited her up to his suite. TV history: Brown is best known for being the first model to appear on TV dressed only in a bra in a 1969 Wonderbra commercial . According to Brown, Cosby handed her a beverage and left the room to make a phone call. 'I took a sip and blacked out,' the woman recalled, adding that when she awakened, she inexplicably found herself lying naked under the covers beside Cosby. She said she left the room feeling 'dirty, ashamed and embarrassed.' Lisa-Lotte Lublin described a similar experience involving Bill Cosby, which allegedly occurred in Las Vegas in 1989, when she was 23 years old. According to the ex-model, she and Cosby were in his Elvis Suite at the Hilton Hotel when he offered her two drinks and proceeded to pet her hair. A short time later she passed out, but she remembered the color of the walls in the room and a flood of bright light. Gloria Allred, who represents the two women, along with seven other Cosby accusers, said Brown and Lublin have decided to come forward years later because they were concerned for their reputations and afraid to take on the wealthy and powerful comedian. Allred reminded reporters that while it was too late to hold Cosby accountable for Lublin's alleged assault, he could still face criminal prosecution in Canada, where there is no statute of limitations. The high-profile attorney also revealed that she knows more women who may be willing to come forward with accusations against him in the future. Cosby's lawyer has called those and similar claims 'discredited' and 'defamatory.'","Jackson appeared on  Watch What Happens Live on Thursday .

"Ukip has been been blasted for an 'abhorrent' Facebook post likening the EU to the Nazis with a Swastika graphic. The Swastika, equating the EU to the Nazi regime which murdered millions during the Second World War, was posted on the official Ukip Newport branch page. The Dad's Army-style post, an apparent parody of wartime invasion plans, shows the Nazi insignia within an EU logo, with arrows suggesting Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat forces are on the brink of invading Britain. Ukip's Newport branch was blasted for an 'abhorrent' Facebook post likening the EU to the Nazis with this Swastika graphic . The Dad's Army (credits pictured) inspired post appeared to compare the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dem to Nazi forces . Invoking the theme tune of the BBC series, the graphic was headed: 'Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Cameron, if you think old England's done?' The post, which has since been deleted, was posted on the Facebook page - described as giving 'all the updates on our candidates standing for Newport East and Newport West' - on Wednesday. Jess Morden, the Labour MP for Newport East, said: 'For Ukip to use a Nazi symbol on a graphic is simply abhorrent. 'Just a fortnight ago, the local Ukip candidate was removed following publication in the media of his support for the far-right British National Party (BNP) and English Defence League (EDL). 'It is clear that a dangerous extremist bloc within Ukip are becoming more prominent. Ukip need to take action.' Nigel Farage's party admitted the post 'may be in bad taste' Tory candidate for Newport East Natasha Asghar said: 'I think it's highly insensitive and disgraceful of UKIP to do such a thing. 'I'm going all I can to promote community cohesion and sticking a swastika up isn't helping anybody.' Paul Halliday, Lib Dem candidate for Newport East, said: 'To somehow equate the other parties with Nazism and to say that Europe is Nazism is naive, distasteful and downright disgusting.' Two weeks ago, Ukip's parliamentary candidate for Newport East resigned after internet comments showing him praising a statement referring to gay people as 'fascist perverts' and 'paedophiles' emerged. Donald Grewar, who was due to stand for the party in Newport East at the general election, was being probed by Ukip after it emerged that he had posted social media comments supportive of the far-right BNP and the EDL. The Ukip candidate for Newport West - a Labour seat - is Gordon Norrie. A Ukip spokesman said: 'The posting on the Newport East Facebook page may be in bad taste. 'Illustrating anything by use of a Swastika is so. However, the confected outrage of the local Labour Party is even more over the top. It must have passed their notice that the branch sees itself as fighting totalitarianism, not supporting it.' Invoking the theme tune of BBC series Dad's Army (pictured), the graphic was headed: 'Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Cameron, if you think old England's done?' The Nazi post is far from the first time Ukip have regretted posts on social media by their party members. In December last year, a Ukip candidate was banned from speaking at a secondary school after posting a picture of a map calling Africa 'Bongo Bongo Land' on Facebook. David Little, parliamentary candidate for Dover and Deal in Kent, caused outrage after he posted a spoof 'Ukip map of the world' on his social media account. The map also referred to the French as 'cheese-eaters' and made reference to 'millions and millions of eastern European immigrants' entering Britain. The party was also forced to axe one of its shortlisted candidates for the General Election after he described mixed-race couples as 'a plague'. Mark Walker, 46, was told he could not stand for Ukip in Bromsgrove, south of Birmingham, after the Facebook post in January. A second social media message by Mr Walker claimed that the Israeli secret service organisation Mossad was responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris. Also in January, former Ukip candidate Ian Couch was spared jail after he sent an offensive email to a mosque after Islamic State extremists beheaded a journalist, as well as posting racial slurs on Facebook. The post contained an image of a pig's head, which was later found in his fridge by police officers. Couch was found guilty of two counts of sending offensive messages and was handed a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for a year. Earlier this month, an official Ukip Twitter account said the death of a police officer under investigation as part of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal was 'Karma'. PC Ali was fatally injured after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield. He was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after it was alleged he twice asked a victim out on a date. Ukip blamed volunteers running the page for the tweet.","Ukip Facebook page posts graphic showing Swastika in EU-style logo .

I have told her we need to forget about him now,' Sheglabo's father told The West Australian. 'But inside my heart is breaking...Sometimes they [your children] hide things from you that you could not even imagine,' he said. Sheglabo, who migrated with his family from Libya in 2010, is believed to be fighting with Islamic State forces in Al-Furat province, near the Syria-Iraq border. The 23-year-old's newly created Twitter page featured photos of himself with knives and AK-47s, outfitted in combat clothing. 'Pass my greetings to my family and tell them don't cry, be happy, ur son is here,' he Tweeted earlier in February. Sheglabo's father said that the economics student became secretive about his personal life last year, and began training in martial arts.

"She is known for being one of Britain's most outspoken personalities. Clinging onto that title, Katie Hopkins, 40, caused outrage on Twitter on Friday evening as she posted a series of messages criticising Kelly Clarkson's weight. While watching the American singer, 32, perform on The Graham Norton Show, the 40-year-old tweeted: 'Jesus, what happened to Kelly Clarkson? Did she eat all of her backing singers?' Scroll down for video . 'Did she eat all of her backing singers?': Outspoken Katie Hopkins, 40 (pictured), caused outrage on Twitter after she criticised Kelly Clarkson's weight on Friday evening while watching The Graham Norton Show . 'That is not baby weight. It is fat': Hopkins' judgemental rant which led many fans to jump to Kelly's defence . The sharp tongued columnist also added: 'Happily I have wide-screen. #grahamnorton'. Sticking up for Clarkson, many users on the micro-blogging site pointed out to Hopkins that Kelly had become a mother for the first time just eight months ago. However this information only fuelled Katie's rant and she continued: 'Darling, if you had a baby a year ago, that is not baby weight. It is fat. Quit calling it cute names to make yourself feel better.' As more people took to Clarkson's defence, the former Celebrity Big Brother contestant then wrote: 'Baby weight, puppy fat, muffin top. We're so weakwilled we have to make up cute names for fat. 'Babies, puppies, muffins. Nope. Just fat love'. Unimpressed with Hopkins' jibes, one person tweeted: 'No, @KTHopkins - it is never ok to slate someone for their weight or appearance. It says much more about you than it does about them.' While someone else commented: 'I think raising her child is more important than hitting the gym. Kind of like how tweeting mean things is for you.' '@KTHopkins Thankfully Kelly Clarkson probably doesn't have a clue who you are. You're a nobody compared to her. And that's what matters', were the words of another Twitter user. Harsh: The outspoken columnist didn't hold back as she took jibes at the American singer over her weight . Doing what she does best: Clarkson, 32, made an appearance on the show to promote her latest single . Following her tirade, on Saturday afternoon Hopkins safeguarded herself by asserting that she was free to say what she pleased on her social media profile. She wrote: 'Let's remember boys and girls and haggard old bags, if you don't like what I say, you don't have to read it. My voice comes with choice. 'No one needs to agree with my views. Accepting we all think differently is the joy of life. Unless you are fat. Then clearly you're wrong.' Earlier this week, Kelly opened up about her feelings about her appearance and how she copes with pressure on her looks. During an interview on BBC Breakfast at the TV studios in Manchester, the American singer admitted that she doesn't really care what people think or say of her, as long as they like her work. 'I don't think that stops at our industry, I think that's in general,' Kelly said, of the criticism over women's bodies in the music business. 'And that's because the female form - even back in the days - the statues were of us. We're beautiful creatures. We're held in high esteem and so with that comes scrutiny. 'I don't know, I've always been confident in my talent and what I love to do, it's never really gotten me down. How I grew up, I've never been super concerned with [how I look].' 'I think raising her child is more important than hitting the gym': Many users of the micro-blogging site pointed out to Hopkins that Clarkson, 32, had just become a mother for the first time eight months ago . Sticking by her words: The former Celebrity Big Brother contestant is known for her brutal opinions . Disclaimer: On Saturday, Katie asserted that she is free to voice her controversial opinions on Twitter . She went on: 'I'm always just worried that I've gotta sound great. I get destroyed if I suck somewhere. ;It destroys me for like, a week. If I have a bad show and then you're like ""oh God, they think I sound like that regularly"". That's when I really go down the rabbit hole.' The star - who rose to fame after winning the first series of American Idol back in 2002 - had previously also admitted that her strong character is down to her mother. 'I think we call that Texan,' Kelly joked, when asked about her 'bolshy' temperament. 'I've always been a confident person.' The new mother - who gave birth to her first daughter with husband Brandon Blackstock last year - also admitted that it was she who put pressure on herself to get back to work after taking time off, rather than her record label. 'I was the person going 'when are we gonna put something out?', because I love working. I love being a mother as well, what's awesome is that I can do both. 'I make for a better parent and individual as long as I'm being productive,' the bubbly star added. Katie Hopkins has become famed for making controversial remarks and voicing her opinion on everything from benefits' claimants to people's weight. The former Apprentice star became embroiled in a row with Loose Women star Coleen Nolan earlier this month after she called out the TV personality on posting cruel jibes about her sister Linda. Hopkins, 40, posted vile messages about Linda on Twitter when the former singer appeared on Celebrity Big Brother last year. On an episode of Loose Women starring Hopkins earlier this month, Coleen kept her cool as she took the chance to confront Hopkins about her nasty comments. Explaining that her sister was a breast cancer survivor, she told the controversial star: 'When my sister was in Big Brother you constantly, day in, day out, went on about how ""fat"" she was', she said. '[Saying],""I wish she'd put her fat arm away, I wish she'd pick up her very droopy breasts. She looks like an old person that smells of urine."" 'As a family, that was very hard. Can you imagine someone saying that about you?' Outspoken Katie Hopkins (left) was confronted by Loose Women star Coleen Nolan (right) after the controversial TV personality posted vile messages on Twitter about her cancer-surviving sister Linda Nolan . However, Hopkins - who was runner-up to Katie Price during the CBB final two weeks ago - refused to back down. She refused to apologise and retorted: 'I get insults every day – I accept what people throw at me. 'If you put yourself out there on TV you have to expect people won’t like you.' It came after Police Scotland said they were looking into an insulting tweet from the provocative TV star about Pauline Cafferkey - the British nurse who contracted Ebola. In December last year, officers said they were investigating posts by Hopkins which called the nurse a ‘sweaty Glaswegian’ and referred to Scots as ‘Jocks’. She wrote: ‘Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn’t cricket.’ Her remarks caused outrage on Twitter, with many accusing her of racism, while journalist Piers Morgan branded her a ‘repulsive creature’. The star also caused controversy during her TLC documentary called 'My Fat Story' in which she put on four stone before attempting to lose it all again to prove it was possible to lose weight. During the show, Hopkins met with a group of five women in London who all work independently as plus-size activists or diet bloggers, so that she could hear opposing views on her claims that 'fat people are lazy'. However, Hopkins quickly upset some of the group and size acceptance campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki stormed out of the room to call the police. She accused the outspoken star of 'hate crimes' after Hopkins told her: 'I’m looking at you and I’m making an assessment that it is not healthy to carry that much weight on your knees.' She continued: 'I just don’t believe you’re healthy in that state. Ms Szrodecki responded: 'Do you not realise where you’re going with this? This is actually to do with a hate crime,' before calling the police. Last year, Hopkins also attacked Benefit Street's White Dee in a furious television debate in which she called her 'the patron saint of drug users and drop outs'. She also famously got embroiled in a debate about children's names on This Morning with Holly Willoughby. Hopkins revealed that she would not let her children play with anyone called 'Tyler, Chardonnay, Charmaine or Chantelle' after claiming she wouldn't like those sorts of children'. And in 2013 - when Hopkins posted a tweet joking about Scottish life expectancy in the wake of a Glasgow helicopter crash that killed ten people - people wanted her off their television sets. She cause outrage by tweeting: 'Life expectancy in Scotland is 59.5. Goodness me. That lot will do anything to avoid working until retirement.' She also once said that ginger babies were: 'Like a baby. Just so much harder to love,' and famously said she would never employ an obese person.","Outspoken Katie Hopkins took to Twitter to criticise singer Kelly Clarkson .

"A growing number of doctors are continuing to practise  despite being convicted of serious crimes such as child porn and sexual assault, it can be revealed today. Figures show that more than 1,000 medics have been allowed to keep their jobs after being found guilty of offences - a 10 per cent rise in two years. Other crimes include cruelty to children, domestic violence, drug-trafficking, possessing dangerous weapons and prostitution offences. It is believed many offenders could be treating children. Campaigners have reacted angrily to the figures, accusing medical chiefs of not doing enough to protect patients. But bosses at the General Medical Council, which released the data, say it is not always possible to automatically ban convicted doctors because it may breach their human rights. Not struck off: Dr Ashley Sibery (left) has been suspended after being convicted of injecting his wife with heroin, but could in theory return to work when the ban expires. Meanwhile, Dr Hassan Abdulla (right) has been allowed to carry on working as a psychiatrist despite being convicted of illegally circumcising 41 boys in a 'non-sterile' unit. He has been barred from carrying out circumcisions for two years . Roger Goss, co-director of Patient Concern, told MailOnline: 'It makes a nonsense of the GMC's claims that it safeguards patients. They safeguard doctors' careers. 'Human rights are supposed to protect patients not doctors. We are in a life-and-death business here. 'There needs to be legislation that makes it illegal for doctors to practise if they are convicted of serious crimes such as sexual offences.' Mr Goss said patients should be told when their doctor has been convicted of an offence or even when an accusation has been made against them. He added: 'We would like to see every complaint against doctors accessible on the internet, with the caveat stating that it is merely an accusation.' The figures, released to MailOnline after a request under the Freedom of Information Act, show there were 1,025 registered doctors with a total of 1172 criminal convictions as of August 28 this year. They reveal that 35 had been convicted of sexual assault, 29 for actual bodily harm and three for grievous bodily harm. Dr Nicholas Spicer (pictured) escaped being struck off in 2010 even though he was described by the General Medical Council as a 'deviant' for downloading child-sex stories . Two were found guilty of possessing indecent images of children, one of taking or making indecent images of children and two of cruelty and neglect of children. Seven medics were convicted of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution, while ten were successfully prosecuted for domestic violence. Meanwhile, more than 340 were convicted of drink-driving and 192 of dangerous driving. Figures released by the GMC in December 2012 showed there was a total of 927 doctors with convictions, meaning there are around 100 more registered this year. Any doctor who receives a custodial sentence is automatically referred to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) which is responsible for holding disciplinary hearings for doctors pursued by the GMC. Dr Nicholas Spicer escaped being struck off in 2010 even though he was described by the GMC as a 'deviant' for downloading child-sex stories. He read the paedophile fantasies on his home computer between 2003 and 2007 while working with children as a GP, but was cleared of misconduct and allowed to go back to work in another part of the country following a six-month ban. In another case, Dr Hassan Abdulla has been allowed to carry on working as a psychiatrist despite being convicted of illegally circumcising 41 boys in a 'non-sterile' unit  in Leicester between October 2011 and January 2012. An MPTS panel banned him in September from carrying out circumcisions for two years, but said to suspend him from working as a mental health doctor would 'deprive the public of a competent psychiatrist'. Meanwhile, Dr Ashley Sibery also escaped a permanent ban despite watching his wife collapse after injecting her with heroin. The 38-year-old was convicted in September 2012 of giving his partner Sital the class A drug at their home in Edinburgh after tucking their three-year-old son into bed. He had earlier admitted to her that he had been using the drug for two months. Sibery was ordered to perform 300 hours community service and placed on supervision by the authorities for two years after he was convicted of culpable and reckless conduct at an Edinburgh Sheriff Court hearing in December 2012. At an original MPTS hearing in January this year, Michael Uberoi, defending, said that striking him off the medical register would be 'disproportionate to the facts of the case'. The tribunal ruled his fitness to practise was impaired by his convictions, but decided to impose just a nine-month ban. On the rise: More than 1,000 medics have been allowed to keep their jobs after being found guilty of crimes ranging from sex assault to child porn - a 10% increase in two years (file picture posed by models) Sibery could have gone back to work when the suspension expired at the end of November, but a panel reviewing his case in October imposed a further 10-month suspension, it was reported by the Edinburgh News. The GMC has said it previously tried to impose an automatic ban for doctors, particularly those on the sex offenders' register, but after consulting with a top lawyer was advised it would be incompatible with human rights legislation. Niall Dickson, Chief Executive of the General Medical Council, told MailOnline: 'For serious convictions, we will now always call for the doctor to be struck off the register. 'We are also seeking powers to remove doctors from the register without the need for a hearing, if they have committed very serious offences, which we believe these are incompatible with practising as a doctor. 'We currently do not have a right of appeal against panel decisions when we believe they are too lenient. 'The government is currently progressing legislation to provide a right to appeal such decisions to the High Court and we hope that legislation will be passed before the General Election.'

"The lawyer wife of movie star George Clooney is set to represent fourteen Irish men who claim they were tortured by the British Army. Amal Clooney has joined the legal team representing the victims - known as the 'Hooded Men' - who were subjected to horrific treatment, including being deprived of sleep, food and water for days. Clooney, a 37-year-old international law and human rights specialist, will represent the men at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg as they seek to have their treatment acknowledged as torture. Distinguished: Amal Clooney will join the legal team set to represent 14 Irish men who claim they were subjected to torture methods by the British Government in the 1970s . Newly married: Amal, 37, with her movie star husband George. She has enjoyed a distinguished career as an international law and human rights specialist . The men were imprisoned under the British government's internment programme in August 1971, when more than 340 men were rounded up across Northern Ireland. They were then selected for 'deep interrogation' at a specially-built centre at a British Army camp, and subjected to 'five techniques' of torture, which included hooding, being made to stand in prolonged stress positions, white noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink. On their way to the interrogation centre in 1971, some of the men were hooded and thrown to the ground from helicopters. They had been told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but in fact they were just a few feet from the ground. None of the men were ever convicted of any offence. In 1976, the European Commission for Human Rights ruled that the British government was guilty of torture, inhumane and degrading treatment. The case was then referred to the European Court for Human Rights, which ruled in 1978 that while the five techniques amounted to 'inhumane and degrading treatment', they did not constitute torture. Victims: Colm O'Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, (front right) with a number of the surviving victims. They became known as the 'Hooded Men' after revealing details of their treatment . But the case will now be reopened after declassified documents were discovered in the British national archives last year that revealed that the British government had withheld crucial evidence from the European Court during the original hearing. The files show that the British government considered the 'special treatment' as torture and yet senior Ministers still sanctioned its use in Northern Ireland - both claims they had denied before the European Court. The Ministry of Defence has consistently rejected allegations that it used torture. Venue: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where the men will take their case . There was controversy last year when it was revealed that some IRA prisoners were afforded pardons while the Good Friday Agreement was being negotiated. The government scheme applied to people wanted for paramilitary crimes committed before the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. Necessary: Former PM Tony Blair, who described the 'On The Runs' scheme as fundamental to the Northern Ireland Peace Processsw . Recently, then Prime Minister Tony Blair said the peace process in Northern Ireland would probably have collapsed without the 'On The Runs' scheme for fugitive IRA members. His Labour government sent about 200 letters to republicans assuring them they were not being pursued by the UK authorities for historical crimes. Last month, Mr Blair told MPs investigating the scheme: 'The issue of On The Runs was absolutely critical to the peace process and at certain points became fundamental to it.' The scheme has been in the spotlight after an investigation was launched  when the prosecution of a man for the murder of four soldiers in a bombing in Hyde Park in 1982 was halted after he received one of the letters in error. A review last year into the scheme by Lady Justice Hallett's review was ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron. The review found the scheme had 'significant systemic failures' in how it operated, but ruled it was lawful. Lady Justice Hallett's report found the administrative scheme was kept 'below the radar' due to its political sensitivity, but said it would be wrong to characterise the scheme as 'secret'. She added: 'If there was a lack of clarity and openness, responsibility lies with the UK government.'","Lawyer set to represent men who say they were tortured by British Army .

"Chelsea fans made clear what they thought of racism the same day police announced they were hunting a gang of men, believed to be fans of the club, who were heard shouting bigoted chants at St Pancras International. The incident, which took place at London St Pancras on Wednesday evening at around 8pm, happened the day after fans of the same club were filmed allegedly pushed a black man off a Paris Metro while shouting a racist chant. An investigation is currently underway after a member of the public reported the men, who had travelled by train from Paris Gard du Nord, reported the incident to British Transport Police. Scroll down for video . Chelsea fans unfurled a pro-equality banner at Stamford Bridge before today's Premier League game with Burnley four days after fans were filmed pushing a man off a Paris train apparently because he was black . This message was a riposte to the chant some of those fans were heard to sing, in which they belted out 'We're racist and that's the way we like it' while being filmed by a British expat on his mobile phone . Chelsea captain John Terryn warms up wearing one of the t-shirts promoting tolerance. The centre-back penned a column in the matchday program, saying 'This club stands against all forms of discrimination' The message to Chelsea fans is clear thanks to this message on a big screen at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea players stretch before today's game, including striker Diego Costa (centre). The program for the clash with Burnley denounced the abuse suffered by a black man in Paris at the hands of Chelsea fans . 'Support Chelsea. Support Equality' is the message to fans before today's home Premier League fixture . A banner reading 'Black or white, we're all blue' was unfurled at Stamford Bridge before this afternoon's Premier League clash with Burnley. The club's reputation has taken a major hit after fans were filmed apparently pushing a black man off a Paris Metro and singing a racist song before Tuesday's one-all Champions League draw against Paris St Germain. Stickers emblazoned with 'Support Chelsea Support Equality' have been handed out, and the first team squad all wore t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan as they warmed up. By coincidence, the club had already designated the fixture as its annual 'Game for Equality'. The club's matchday program denounced the abuse over several pages, including a column by captain John Terry, who served a four-match Football Association ban in 2012 after the governing body found him guilty of racially abusing then-Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand in a game. 'This club stands against all forms of discrimination,' Terry wrote. 'Football is a sport for everyone, that is one of the main reasons why we love it.' Wednesday's incident is believed to have happened as fans were returning home after attending the game in the French capital the night before. The group of men, thought to be Chelsea fans, were walking through St Pancras International station after getting off a train from Paris when they reportedly engaged in racist chanting . They had been travelling back from the French capital on the 6.40pm Eurostar service, said BTP . CCTV images of three Chelsea football fans still being sought by police over the Paris Metro incident . Superintendent Gill Murray, of British Transport Police, said: 'The racist chanting was reported by a member of the public who was disgusted by the behaviour of the men who had travelled on the 6.40pm service from Paris Gard du Nord. 'The men shouted as they walked through the station having alighted from the train a short time earlier. 'If you travelled on the train from Paris or were at the station and have information which can assist our investigation I would urge you to get in touch as a matter of urgency.' Ms Murray continued: 'It's clear that unfortunately there is still a minority who think it is acceptable to behave in such an abhorrent manner. 'There is more that needs to be done to publicly condemn this type of behaviour and British Transport Police is actively working with football clubs, the football authorities and other key agencies to tackle this appalling behaviour.' Police are seeking three more Chelsea football fans they believe were involved in Tuesday's allegedly racist incident at the Richelieu-Drouot station of the Paris Metro. Paris Metro incident victim Souleymane S has since spoken out about his ordeal at the hands of Chelsea fans . Five people have so far been suspended from the club's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into what happened and face lifetime bans if they're found guilty of any offence. Images have been released in a bid to identify the trio, who the Met think were among a group of Chelsea supporters involved in the incident while on their way to the Champions League last-16 clash. In a video filmed on a mobile phone the fans could apparently be heard chanting: 'We're racist and that's the way we like it.' That incident was filmed by a passenger and brought widespread condemnation, from the United Nations to British Prime Minister David Cameron and FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Chelsea have said they are 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane S, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved at a press conference yesterday.

"A former chairman of the Falls Church Democratic Party charged with molesting two young girls is accused of plotting to have them killed before they testified against him during his trial. Michael Gardner, 50, from Falls Church, Virginia, is said to have approached an inmate in 2013 about finding a hit man to kill the young girls. The inmate he contacted notified police in January about their multiple conversations, according to court documents. In a letter, presented during a pretrial motion, the inmate said he told Gardner his friend could help with his 'three problems' that he had 'pre-trial' - which allegedly referred to the two girls and an unspecified third issue. It has not been revealed whether the lives of the girls, who were aged nine and ten at the time of the assault, are in danger but police said the potential threats were taken seriously. Michael Gardner (left pictured with his wife Robin, right), 50, from Virginia charged with molesting two young girls is accused of plotting to have them killed before they testified against him at his molestation trial . He is said to have approached an inmate in 2013 about finding a hit man to kill the young girls, and that inmate notified police in January, according to court documents . One of the victim's mothers said the new allegations were 'unbelievable', according to WUSA9. Ana Down, a friend of the victim's families, said: 'They're being terrorized over and over and over again and now, with these new allegations, it's beyond belief.' Following a polygraph test the inmate took, he revealed Gardner had also targeted a detective and the two prosecutors as potential murder victims. During the pretrial motion, a letter from the inmate to Gardner was quoted saying: 'I want you to know I haven't forgotten what we've discussed. The friend you asked me to contact to see if he could help with the ""three problems"" you have pre-trial will be passing through VA on a FL to NY ""run"".' 'Get back to me right away because I don't [want] his visiting you to interfere with Robin and the kids [sic] anticipated visit.' In 2011, Gardner was convicted of molesting two girls during his daughter's slumber party for her tenth birthday, according to the Washington Post. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison before the conviction was overturned by Virginia's Supreme Court that ruled the trial judge stopped the defense attorney from asking character witnesses about Gardner. He was later released and granted a new trial. In 2011, Gardner was convicted of molesting two girls during his daughter's slumber party for her tenth birthday and sentenced to 22 years in prison - but the conviction was overturned. He was arrested last October for molesting a young girl under the age of 13 who is also a family member. His wife Robin (right) is set to testify against him in a pretrial hearing . He was arrested again last October for allegedly abusing another young girl in 2009 who was under the age of 13 at the time, and is also a family member, according to WJLA. Gardner's attorney Chris Liebig is wanted to stand on trial by prosecutors to testify about the revelations in the case. Liebig believes the informant is a 'professional snitch' and said Gardner denies the allegations. Robin Gardner, his wife and former mayor of Falls Church, is set to testify on Monday in a pretrial hearing concerning the most recent molestation allegations her husband faces involving their relative. Gardner's trial is scheduled to begin on March 4, but next week a judge is going to determine how the new allegations impact the case.","Michael Gardner, 50, from Falls Church, VA approached inmate in 2013  about finding hit man .

"You'd be forgiven for thinking that paying for excess baggage on skiing holidays would ensure guests leave with everything they arrived with. But ski resorts have seen a record amount of lost property this season with some bizarre items left behind beggaring belief, according to one specialist tour operator. Crystal Ski Holidays has compiled a lost property inventory from December to January that ranges from predictable apparel such as goggles and long johns to dentures and a frightening number of mankinis. Not a pretty sight: A tour operator says ski resorts have found 13 forgotten 'manikinis' since December . Staff at resorts found 13 mankinis left behind in guests' rooms this season alone . Three pairs of Spanx, two unwrapped Christmas presents, a customised flute, a set of dentures and a life-size cutout of EastEnders character Lucy Beale, played by actress Hetti Bywater, have also been discovered. The list of items includes 98 Santa hats, 756 empty bottles of alcohol and a walking stick. Crystal Ski Holidays has discovered a myriad of bizarre items left by guests, including 17 selfie sticks .

A spokesperson for Crystal Ski Holidays said: 'With our resorts accommodating more than several hundred-thousand guests this season, its unsurprising that so much lost property was left behind, however some of the more bizarre items have caused disbelief for our staff. 'We expect a number of ski-related items to be left behind, but the life-size cut out of Lucy Beale was somewhat of a surprise, especially as none of our staff saw ""her"" entering the chalet. 'We can confirm she was still in good condition when we found her.' The spokesperson added: 'What has been interesting in the finds is that you can start to track the trends of our customers. 'Despite Borat being released in the cinema nearly 10 years ago, the mankini is still a ""style"" trend, and the selfie stick, which was touted as the ""must-have"" Christmas present was obviously not popular with 17 of our customers.' A similar study by travel website SkyScanner investigated the unusual things left behind on planes. It found that passengers had discarded or forgotten to take with them a wedding ring, trombone, false teeth and even a fridge.","Operators say a record amount of lost property has been left behind .

"It is known for its stunning skyline. And this week, Manhattan, New York, was perhaps even more picturesque as the so-called 'Siberian Express' swept across the borough. The arctic blast, which has now been joined by a new winter storm, barreled into the region on Friday, bringing sub-zero temperatures, snow and ice. And as these photos show, its effects were magical from an aerial perspective - with the city's Central Park blanketed in a pristine sheet of snow.

Lynchburg, Virginia, even saw a bone-chilling minus 11 degrees - a new all-time record low . The sub-zero temperatures transformed a fountain in Letchworth State Park, New York, into a 50-foot 'ice volcano', caused the Niagara Falls to partially freeze over and led to 40-foot snow piles in the streets of Boston.

"A mentally ill man suspected of burning down his neighborhood's adult film store to eradicate porn is being charged with arson. Mitchell Hapner, 41, worked as a hair dresser about a mile from Hollywood Nights before it was completely gutted by a fire on Wednesday afternoon. Police say that he told them he was trying to 'eradicate' porn. Scroll down for video . Mitchell Hapner, 41, is charged with burning down the Hollywood Nights sex shop in Kalamazoo, Michigan and said that he wanted to 'eradicate' porn in his neighborhood . A man with an axe, thought to be Hapner, was seen leaving the building during the fire. Hapner, who is also charged with fleeing police, admitted to police that he was behind the blaze, according to MLive.com. Witnesses of the fire reported seeing a man leave in a silver Jaguar, which police later tried to stop. The car reached speeds of 65mph in 35mph zones before crashing into another vehicle, according to police. Hapner's family wrote a statement Friday saying that they had been trying to get help for his mental illness for years, but were stopped by a broken mental health system, according to WOOD TV. They said they 'were saddened to learn that Mitch was responsible for the arson at Hollywood Nights, but the news did not surprise us'. A man with an axe was seen leaving the scene of the fire and police later tracked down Hapner in his Jaguar . Hapner, who has previously said that he received prophecies from God, worked at a hair salon about a mile away from the Hollywood Nights store . In previous encounters with police he has said that he had received a 'prophecy from God'. He had been ordered to mental health treatment two years ago. Last September he said that he backed a car into his father's house because he was acting on 'God's word' and was ordered to treatment for 90 days. At Friday's arraignment, Hapner's bond was set at $250,000 on the condition that he undergoes a mental health evaluation. He said he objected to the evaluation. Third degree arson in Michigan is punishable by up to ten years in prison. He is next set to appear in court on March 10. The owners of the store set up a GoFundMe page to help rebuild their 'family business' before the page was later disabled. Their shop was uninsured before its roof collapsed Wednesday and they planned to raise $300,000. No one was injured in the fire.

"An Australian sign language interpreter has become an internet sensation after his performance at a press conference over the cyclone which has cause £1billion in damage across eastern Australia. Mark Cave was standing beside Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk at a press conference, when reaction to his efforts started to trend on Twitter. People were impressed by Mr Cave's expressive facial features and dramatic hand gestures as he warned deaf people about the approaching storm. Scroll down for video . Mark Cave, right, became an internet sensation after he signed a press conference warning about a cyclone . Twitter users soon began praising Mr Cave's over-the-top facial expressions and arm gestures . Many people got distracted by the energetic performance and Mr Cave's range of expressions . Mr Cave was using Auslan, an Australian version of sign language, to deliver his message. Premier Palaszczuk was giving advice about the impending Category Five Cyclone which was about to hit Queensland. Due to the danger posed by the storm Mr Cave's gestures were exaggerated to highlight the severity of the situation. Charlie Swinbourne, editor of Limping Chicken, a blog for the deaf community said someone using sign language will change their mannerisms to emphasise certain words in the same way hearing people can do it with the inflection of their voice. Mr Cave used the exaggerated signs to highlight the danger posed by Tropical Cyclone Marcia . Mr Cave said he would rather not be in the spotlight claiming that he was 'just hoping to fly under the radar' He blogged: 'Well, if you’re signing about a storm, and telling people that they really need to take the advice you’re giving them, otherwise they might be injured or die, it’s not enough just to tell them – you need to show them, visually, through your demeanour, just how serious this situation is, and how powerful the storm might be. 'And that’s exactly what these interpreters are doing. Watching the video video of Mark Cave in action, he’s no more animated than he should be, and the information he gives is perfectly clear. In some ways, the way these interpreters go viral every time a storm comes is a good thing, in terms of raising public awareness of Deaf people – who are often so hidden from wider view – and of the language we use. 'What worries me is that some people think that the interpreters are doing something comical – which they aren’t. 'These skilled interpreters aren’t making fun of the situation, or giving people at home a cheap laugh. They’re simply signing in the most expressive and powerful way they can in order to tell deaf people how they can remain safe.' People on Twitter supportive of Mr Cave's efforts managed to get the hastag #signguy trending . Some users used Mr Cave's new-found popularity to have fun with Photoshop by manipulating his image . However some deaf campaigners criticised some of the Photoshop efforts as they diminished his message . Mr Cave said he was slightly surprised by his new-found fame: 'I’m sort of a private person. I’d rather not be in the spotlight, but I know this is such an important thing to do, and I feel confident I can do a good job. 'I’m just hoping to fly under the radar and nobody will look at me afterwards.' Following Friday's storms, some 700 troops have been placed on standby to help with cleanup efforts. Premier Palaszczuk said: 'At this stage, everyone is breathing a deep sigh of relief that there has been no loss of life.' Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, left, said it was amazing there had been no loss of life . However, most properties in the northern Queensland towns of Rockhampton and Yeppoon had been left without power, she added. The worst of the rain would pass by Sunday as the storm is moving quickly back out to sea, the weather bureau said. In Rockhampton, long queues snaked out of the only fuel station left with the power to run its petrol pumps, as people flocked to refill cars and get fuel to operate generators. Residents ducked fallen trees and power lines to gather at the few automatic cash machines still functioning. Heavy machinery was pressed into assist efforts to clear debris on the road to Yeppoon, the coastal town hit hardest by Marcia, but fallen power lines left many roads impassable. In northern Australia, teams were heading to two communities on the remote islands of Goulburn and Elcho to weigh up damage after Cyclone Lam, packing wind speeds ranging up to 160mph, began to lash the Northern Territory late on Thursday.","Mark Cave was warning deaf people about the storm threatening Australia .

"A Canadian automobile executive imprisoned in Cuba on corruption charges for more than three years was released today - only five months into the 15-year jail sentence he was given in September. Cy Tokmakjian, 74, had his case ended by Cuba's government who called it a demonstration of the fight against bribery, and critics said it was a warning against doing business in the country. The executive, who is owner of Ontario-based  Tokmakjian Group, was serving jail time after his arrest in a 2011 anti-graft drive that swept up Cuban officials and foreign business executives from at least five nations. Cy Tokmakjian (above), 74, a Canadian automobile executive who was imprisoned in Cuba on corruption charges for more than three years was released today - only five months into his 15-year jail sentence . 'Cy returns home in good health, fantastic spirits, and is looking forward to spending time with his family which includes three loving children and seven excited grandchildren,' said his lawyer Barry Papazian. The case was seen by some as a loose end in the US/Cuba deal late last year that led to the release of three Cuban intelligence agents in exchange for US contractor Alan Gross and CIA spy Rolando Sarraff Trujillo. The executive, who is owner of Ontario-based Tokmakjian Group (above the Ontario office), was serving jail time after his arrest in a 2011 anti-graft drive that swept up Cuban officials and foreign business executives from at least five nations . Canada and the Vatican hosted key talks during in 18 months of negotiations leading up to the exchange, which was accompanied by a joint move to restore full diplomatic relations between the countries. It was not revealed by Canadian officials on whether the deal boosted their efforts to win freedom for Tokmakjian, and no immediate reason was given for his sudden release. The company statement made no mention of two Canadian aides from the Tokmakjian Group who were also convicted and sentenced to 12 and eight years. They had been under house arrest throughout the trial and while their convictions were being appealed. Fourteen Cubans were also convicted and sentenced to terms ranging from six to 20 years in a case that strained Cuba's relations with Canada, a major trading partner, and which could deter foreigners from investing with the communist government. His family said his prosecution was an excuse to seize his Ontario-based Tokmakjian Group's $100 million in assets in Cuba. Tokmakjian's case ended by Cuba's government who called it a demonstration of the fight against bribery, and critics said it was a warning against doing business in the country (above local residents in Old Havana, Cuba) Some potential investors in Cuba said the case made them wary of Cuba's drive to draw billions in new foreign investment. Foreign business people have long considered payoffs ranging from a free meal to cash deposits in overseas accounts to be an unavoidable cost of doing business in Cuba. They have skeptically greeted government assertions that rooting out rampant corruption is among the country's highest priorities.","Cy Tokmakjian, 74, was arrested in 2011 on corruption charges; he was given jail sentence in September .

"Wandering around National Trust properties, with their tree-lined drives, gilded drawing rooms and 20ft dining tables dressed with Sèvres porcelain, you may dream of living in one yourself. Well, what’s stopping you? The National Trust lets about 5,000 properties. Initially, the lease is for six months, but they can be extended to ten or 20 years. Competition to secure one is fierce, especially for custodian tenancies. These are for houses that are of historic or architectural interest, and in return for opening the house on certain days, the charity reduces the tenant’s rent. Custodians : David Scott with dog Annie at The Homewood which was designed by Patrick Gwynne in 1938 . Accountant David Scott and his publisher partner Louise Cavanagh have lived at The Homewood, a modernist house near Esher, Surrey, with their daughter Isabella and border collie Annie since 2007. The 1938 house was designed by architect Patrick Gwynne. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Gwynne designed houses throughout the South, and was also responsible for such diverse buildings as the Serpentine Bar and Kitchen in London’s Hyde Park and Burtonwood service station on the M62 in Cheshire. ‘There were 60 applicants at the start,’ says David. ‘But a lot fell away when they realised the scale of responsibilities.’ After seven rounds of interviews, his family was deemed suitable to be responsible for accommodating 2,500 visitors a year to the house. Hackhurst Farm, Surrey: MI5 whistleblower David Shayler squatted in the 16th Century home near Dorking. Rent is £2,500 a month . South Cottage, Cumbria: This two-bedroom cottage, attached to St Bees Lighthouse, will cost you £550 a month . ‘We have a 30-strong army of fantastic volunteers to steward the house and help with the garden, but we have to interview, select and train them. 'We’re open from April to October and hold a pre-season party for them every year. ‘We have to pay for a cleaner, a gardener and all the gardening equipment. The winter power bills are £35 a day – the house has 5,000 sq ft of single glazing – and we pay two lots of council tax since there’s also an unstaffed staff flat on the site.’ David and Louise both work from home: ‘It would be impossible if we didn’t,’ explains David. ‘I need to be on site nine days out of ten when we’re open, here for when the Trust sends workmen or restorers, and present for all the power, alarm and tree inspections.’ The six-acre garden and five rooms are open to the public. ‘It’s tough if you’re ill. You have to cross from the bedroom to the kitchen through a public area,’ laughs David. Custodian tenanted properties are furnished. The Homewood has important pieces such as a Patrick Gwynne sofa, an Eames recliner, and metal chairs by William Plunkett, who designed furniture for the QE2. Bellister Castle, Northumberland: Seven-bedroom castle, overlooks South Tyne Valley - a snip at £1,500 a month . Woolbeding, West Sussex: Seven-bedroom, three-reception-room manor house costs £4,500 a month . Not all lettings require tenants to open properties to the public. There are also standard tenancies, and there are about 40 properties to rent in this category, ranging from tiny cottages in national parks that will set you back less than the rent on a London flat, to Bellister Castle in Northumberland. Some properties come with a whiff of scandal attached. In 2009, MI5 whistleblower David Shayler and other squatters were evicted from the 16th Century Hackhurst Farm in Surrey, which can now be rented for £2,500 a month. ‘It’s set in wonderful open countryside,’ says Andrea Jones, Hackhurst’s departing tenant. ‘Over the fence I can see Belted Galloway cattle on one side and sheep and pasture land on the other. The Trust is a great landlord. I was proud to be a tenant.’","The National Trust lets 5,000 properties with leases starting at six months .

"Tens of thousands of North Koreans have been forced to work overseas in slave conditions in order to feed money back to Pyongyang to buy luxuries for Kim Jong-Un, a new report reveals. The impoverished labourers have  been found working on sweltering construction sites in the Middle East,  in deadly mines where locals refuse to go, or in a chain of Pyongyang restaurants. Human rights campaigners say Kim's greed for the finer things in life, and his mbitions building projects for Pyongyang, mean the practice is on the rise as the need for steady cash rises. Scroll down for video . North Korean workers were found toiling on the Lusail City construction site in Doha, Qatar, due to host the 2022 World Cup. Asked why they were there, one said 'to earn money for our government' The workers are often paid as little as 300 roubles, or £3.18, per day with most of this confiscated from them, according to a report by the North Korean Strategy Center. They are ferried to and from work by bus, are kept under armed guard, and at night are locked away in safe houses so they cannot escape, the report says. While the practice has been commonly employed to raise money for the cash-strapped communist nation since the 70s, it is on the rise again thanks to Kim's greed for luxury good. Ahn Myeong-chul, head of Seoul-based human rights group NK Watch, told the New York Times: '[Pyongyang] is exploiting their labour and salaries to fatten the private coffers of Kim Jong-Un.' 'We suspect that Kim is using some of the money to buy luxury good for his elite followers and finance the recent building boom in Pyongyang that he has launched to show off his leadership.' Pyong Yang restaurant in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, just one of a chain of similar restaurants in the far east believed to be staffed by Office 39 workers . In 2014 a group of 50 North Koreans were found helping to build Lusail City, the lavish development in the Doha desert, Qatar, which will eventually host the 2022 World Cup final. According to the Guardian, the men work tirelessly day and night, keep less than 10 per cent of the meager wage they earn, and have  been provided with a room to rest in on site so they don't have to leave when taking breaks. They are contracted out by Office 39, a shady North Korean fundraising outfit that has exported as many as 100,000 such workers in recent years. Russia has been named as the biggest recipient of North Korean labour with at least 20,000-25,000 workers in the country.

"You won't find any Gatorade spills on this kitchen top. Abandoned for decades, this perfectly pink, immaculately clean kitchen is frozen in time. The 1962 masterpiece in Chicago was discovered by furniture collector Nathan Chandler 17 years ago. It boasts blonde wood, star-shaped handles, and all pink appliances including a General Electric combination wall mount refrigerator, and an automatic built-in oven. Finally, on February 15, the kitchen was sold. In a move that should hopefully maintain its spotlessness, the buyer received a few cases of vintage washing up powder that was left 59 years ago.

"A pilot who ejected from a US fighter jet moments before it smashed to the ground radioed a colleague to say: 'Dude, I'm getting out'. The pilot bailed out of his $30million F15-D fighter jet, from RAF Lakenheath, at 6,000ft before the aircraft crashed into a field just yard from houses near Spalding, Lincolnshire, last October. Documents on the crash show he ejected after the plane went into a flat spin, where the aircraft rotates on its belly making almost impossible to recover from, at 15,000ft. Scroll down for video .

"A woman accused of killing a British student after injecting her with industrial-grade silicone has gone on trial accused of murder in America. Claudia Aderotimi died in 2011 after travelling from her home in London to Philadelphia to have silicone injections because she wanted a bigger bottom. But Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42, is accused of using a mix of industrial-grade silicone and glue that spread to Ms Aderotimi's brain and lungs, causing heart failure and killing her. Charged: Windslowe is accused of killing British student Claudia Aderotimi after injecting her with industrial-grade silicone that caused heart failure . Tragic: Claudia Aderotimi, from London, died in February 2011 after receiving a silicone injection in her buttocks in her pursuit of a bigger bottom . Accused: Though she had no medical training, Windslowe (above) would charge up to £1,200 per injection . Windslowe - a transgender rapper known as 'Black Madam' - is now on trial for third-degree murder in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court. Ms Aderotimi, 20, believed a 'bigger booty' would help her appear in more music videos and further her career as a dancer. The Thames Valley University student developed chest pains and struggled for breath 12 hours after she had the illegal injections at a budget hotel. She was rushed to hospital but could not be saved. An examination found the silicone filler had leaked into her bloodstream, leading to heart failure. It is believed Windslowe treated her with cheap ‘industrial’ silicone, normally used as a sealant, rather than medical-grade material used in breast implant surgery. Windslowe, who does not have an injecting license, then allegedly closed the wounds with glue and cotton balls. When Ms Aderotimi complained of chest . pains, Windslowe allegedly told her to drink more fluids and to call an . ambulance if needed. At the pre-trial hearing, Windslowe boasted of the quality of her work and told the judge; 'I am the Michelangelo of buttocks injections...A lot of people came to me. My work spoke for itself.' Police say that Windslowe fled the hotel room after Aderotimi started having trouble breathing during 'a touch-up,' which was intended as part of her birthday celebrations. Flirt: Padge Victoria Windslowe (left) flirted with Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega (right) during her murder trial . Unlicensed: Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave another exotic dancer . A coroner has testified that the industrial-grade silicone spread to her lungs and brain and caused a pulmonary embolism. Though she had no medical training, Windslow would charge clients up to £1,200 per injection. The hearing was held to discuss the defence's request to have the trial aborted as one of the prosecution's key witnesses has stated she will not travel from London to Philadelphia to testify. Theresa Gyamfi was present on February 11, 2011, when Claudia Aderotimi allegedly received a silicone injection in her buttocks from Windslowe. The judge ruled that Gyamfi's testimony from a 2012 preliminary hearing could be read to the jury. Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave exotic dancer Shurkia King at another 'pumping party'. King was admitted to the hospital with difficulty breathing and vomiting blood after receiving an injection. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Windslowe flirted with Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega and then 'cooed' at her attorney, David S. Rudenstein and said:  'I'm very happy with you, Mr. Rudenstein. You made my day a delight.' Rudenstein replied: 'Well, that's good.' The trial will resume on Monday.","Claudia Aderotimi, from London, died in 2011 following silicone injection .

Taking over from former founders and designers, Sarah-Jane Clarke and Heidi Middleton, Cuthbertson - whose CV includes consulting work for Victoria Beckham and Mulberry - certainly had big shoes to fill. The AW15 collection, Mojo-Kico, was rebellious and effervescent - and proved that Cuthbertson can design with aplomb. Scroll down for video .

"Channel 4 is facing calls to cancel the follow-up to controversial series Benefits Street after claims it will spark racial tensions. The broadcaster is due to show Immigration Street on Tuesday night, but the local MP and police and crime commissioner have called for it to be scrapped. The fly-on-the-wall documentary follows residents on Derby Road, Southampton, including pub landlord Barrie Short. In the last census, only 17 per cent of people in the area described themselves as White British. Immigration Street set in Derby Road, Southampton, is due to be broadcast on Channel 4 on Tuesday night . Channel 4 had commissioned a series of six episodes, but it has been cut to a one-hour programme after filming was interrupted by angry residents pelting the crew with eggs and flour. In advertising, the programme makers claimed the street is known locally as ‘The Jungle’. Residents raised concerns the show will stigmatise the area. Many put up posters to discourage filming during the summer, and held a protest outside Channel 4’s London headquarters. In an open letter to the broadcaster, community leaders including MP Alan Whitehead and police and crime commissioner Simon Hayes called for the ‘ill-named and ill-advised’ programme to be stopped. Featured: Landlord Barrie Short is set to appear in the show . The letter said the street is a ‘harmonious, open, thriving, successful and diverse community’ and residents ‘do not want [it] to be stigmatised or damaged’. It accused the production team of ‘reluctance to work constructively with the local community and us’. Dr Whitehead, a Labour MP, said last night: ‘The residents never wanted this programme to be foisted upon them. ‘It has been a misconceived idea from the start. I wrote to all the householders … and 95 per cent said they did not think the programme was a good idea and did not want to take part. ‘Most of the families are second, third or fourth generation of immigrants in Southampton and take considerable exception to being branded as Immigration Street … I think to turn up from nowhere and label the street in this way was always a mistake.’ A spokesman for Channel 4 said last night: ‘Immigration is too important an issue for debate about it to be silenced. ‘A wide range of the people on Derby Road were happy to share their stories with us and … the programme does nothing to promote racial tension, but honestly observes lives in a diverse community … Residents are watching their contributions before the programme is screened as planned at 10pm on Tuesday.’ j.stevens@dailymail.co.uk .","Channel 4 is facing calls to cancel Immigration Street ahead of broadcast .

"A man who escaped from a minimum security prison in Mississippi 35 years ago and was captured living in Utah has now been returned to Mississippi to serve out the remainder of his sentence, officials said on Friday. Sam Gene Harris, 62, was sentenced in 1979 to six years in prison for burglary and possession of burglary tools, the Mississippi Department of Corrections said in a statement. He escaped from the Forrest County Community Work Center in southern Mississippi the following year, 1980, the department said. Mississippi authorities learned of Harris's whereabouts from the FBI, the state's prisons department said. Back to prison, buddy: Sam Gene Harris had escaped from two jails in Oregon before escaping the Forrest County Community Work Center in southern Mississippi in 1980. In January, 35 years later, police found him living in a tiny Utah town and arrested him (left). On Friday, he was returned to prison in Mississippi (right) He was extradited from Utah on Sunday. Before his arrest in January, Harris had lived in Wellington, a town of 1,600 people about 100 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, for 23 years, KSL-TV quoted a local sheriff as saying. During his decades on the run, Harris had come into contact with law enforcement and had used aliases, said Mississippi Department of Corrections spokeswoman Grace Fisher. He has lived under at least 10 different names, and has escaped from two other jails in Oregon. He also has a criminal history in Florida and Georgia, including charges for theft and assaulting an officer . At the time of his arrest, Harris was living as Wayne Stevens in a small house on a main road. An FBI bulletin about wanted people tipped off Utah police to his identity. Police had been staking out his home trying to get an idea of the property's layout when they saw Harris walking across the street. They decided to pounce and arrested him. Minimum security: Sam Harris escaped from the Forrest County Community Work Center in southern Mississippi. Here the facility is seen how it looks today. Harris was returned there Friday . Harris tried to convince police they had nabbed the wrong man, however fingerprints proved otherwise. He also said he had suffered a serious brain injury a few years prior and had memory problems. Exact details about his escape are sketchy because it was so long ago. However Harris remained on wanted persons lists. Interestingly, Harris will not incur additional prison time for his escape because fleeing from a community work center was at the time a misdemeanor, the department said in its statement. He will be eligible for release in 2018.","Sam Gene Harris was sentenced  to six years prison for burglary in 1979 .

"When none of an autistic boy's classmates showed up for his sixth birthday party, his community and local sheriff's office rallied together to make it a birthday he'd never forget. Ashlee Buratti, of St. Cloud, Florida, had invited her son Glenn's class of 16 children to his birthday on February 8, and when no one showed up, he was devastated. Though no one RSVP'd, Buratti and her husband John Buratti were 'still holding on to the hope that some of them would show up' to the party for her son, who has epilepsy and a mild form of autism. 'From the minute he woke up that day he wanted to know how many minutes until his friends came,' Buratti, 25, said, adding that his eyes filled with tears when he learned no one was coming. Glenn Buratti, of St. Cloud, Florida, turned six on February 8, and though his mom Ashlee Buratti had invited all 16 of his classmates to a birthday party, not a single person showed up . After posting her frustration on Facebook, Buratti received messages of support from the community and people - including firemen and policemen - offered to stop by the family's home to make it a birthday Glenn would never forget . Glenn, who loves public safety and law enforcement, was overjoyed with the party, and his mom said that though he is usually shy, he took to his new friends like he'd known them all his life . The mother-of-three posted on a locally run Facebook page with more than 10,000 members titled, Osceola Rants, Raves and Reviews List, to express her frustration, according to the Osceola News-Gazette. 'I know this might be something silly to rant about, but my heart is breaking for my son. We invited his whole class (16 kids) over for his 6th birthday party today. Not one kid came,' she posted. And when other group members saw the post they sent Buratti messages asking if they could bring their own kids to Glenn's party to celebrate. The message even reached staff from the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, who asked for the family's address and said a helicopter would fly over their St. Cloud home. The helicopter came to the house within an hour, and the pilot flew low enough that Glenn could see him waving. Glenn, who loves public safety and law enforcement, was overjoyed with the party, and his mom said that though he is usually shy, he took to his new friends like he'd known them all his life. 'In general, deputies have big hearts - they thought about their own kids and wanted to make this boy happy because it was such a sad situation,' Buratti told Today. In total, about 15 kids and 25 adults showed up to celebrate and eat cake, give gifts to Glenn and play in a bounce house. The Osceola County Sheriff's office flew a helicopter over Glenn's house on the day of his party, and the pilot flew low enough to wave at the boy . Staff from the Osceola County Sheriff's Office returned to the house three days after Glenn's party to give him with gifts and tours of vehicles .

His mother Ashlee Buratti said Glenn's birthday was 'just amazing' and that everyone who came out was 'so awesome' One woman brought the birthday boy a bike, while others brought toys. Buratti said one man came to the party with a camera and took pictures he later gave to the family. 'It was just amazing. The people who came out were so awesome,' Buratti told the Osceola News-Gazette. And Glenn's birthday celebration didn't end on Sunday - several crews from the Sheriff's Office and Osceola County Fire Rescue stopped by the family's home on Wednesday. Though Buratti knew the crews were coming, she left it a surprise for her son to see as they were on their way home from school. 'We got to the stop sign by our house and Glenn was like, ""The fire truck's at our house!"" I said, ""It's okay, they're there to tell you happy birthday,""' Buratti told CBS News. They all wished him a happy birthday, gave him tours of their fire truck, squad cars, motorcycles and a SWAT vehicle and showered him with more gifts. 'And to think, all this happened because nobody showed up to his birthday,' Buratti wrote online. 'Thank you, thank you, thank you.' And Glenn's birthday celebration didn't end on Sunday - several crews from the Sheriff's Office and Osceola County Fire Rescue stopped by the family's home on Wednesday .

Glenn's dad, John Buratti, was also moved by the community's celebrations. He posted pictures of the events on Facebook and thanked everyone involved. He wrote on Facebook: 'Huge thank you to Osceola County Sheriff's Department, Osceola County Fire Rescue and Frank who owns Koffee Kup for coming to our house today for my son Glenn's Birthday. 'He had such a great time! I'm sure the neighbors were peeking out of their windows or taking cover. Such an amazing thing for our local law enforcement and fire fighters to do for us. Thank you to everyone involved.' Ashlee Buratti told WKMG that a week after the party, she still hadn't heard from any of the parents of Glenn's classmates, but she wanted to thank all of the strangers that made her son's day. 'The amazingness of everybody coming together for someone like that they didn't even know, a kid that didn't have anybody come to his birthday party - it warmed my heart,' she said. This birthday party scenario isn't uncommon for children who have autism and that there's a general anxiety around birthdays for parents across the world, Ashlee Buratti told Today. 'My only advice is don't give up. Don't automatically assume people will ignore them ore push them away. Give people the benefit of the doubt,' she said. The government officials all wished Glenn a happy birthday, gave him tours of their fire truck, squad cars, motorcycles and a SWAT vehicle and showered him with more gifts .

"Rotherham Council spent £2million on a ‘personal vanity project’ to bring Dolly Parton to the town – at the same time as child sex grooming by mainly Pakistani men was being ignored. Roger Stone, its council leader at the time, is a lifelong fan of the country singer and persuaded her to set up a children’s reading project. She visited the town amid great fanfare in 2007 to launch the scheme, which now looks likely to close. The project aimed to attract support from businesses to pay for every child under five to receive a book every month but the council struggled to find sponsors. 'Vanity project': Former Rotherham Council leader Roger Stone is a lifelong fan of the country singer and persuaded her to set up a children’s reading project. Above, Mr Stone with Dolly Parton in Rotherham in 2007 . Mr Stone, who resigned in August after a report heavily criticised the authority for the grooming scandal, had persuaded Miss Parton to be the Imagination Library scheme’s patron. Don Buxton, a campaigner in the town who obtained details of the scheme through the Freedom of Information Act, said: ‘The Imagination Library is another one of those damaging, expensive, failed personal political vanity projects of the Roger Stone era.’ Emma Hoddinott, deputy leader of the Labour-dominated council, which is now to be run by government appointed commissioners after being branded unfit for purpose, said the future of the scheme is under review. Mr Stone is to be questioned next month by a Select Committee over failures by the council after more than 1,400 children were abused by gangs of mainly Pakistani men. Resignation: Mr Stone resigned from Rotherham Borough Council (headquarters pictured) in August after a report heavily criticised the authority for the grooming scandal . He was described as a ‘sexist bully’ in a later report into its handling of the scandal. In 2007, hundreds of businessmen and civic leaders were invited to the launch of the Imagination Library at Rotherham’s Magna science and technology centre. The launch, including a slap-up lunch, was rumoured to have cost more than £10,000, and Miss Parton, 69, played guitar and sang a handful of her hits, including Jolene. She spoke to the visitors about her poor upbringing and her resulting passion for reading. Worth an estimated £110million, Parton chose Rotherham to launch the scheme in Europe after being impressed that it had introduced a similar method locally.","Rotherham Council spent £2million to bring singer Dolly Parton to the town .

"In his first network interview since St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting and killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said his department is 'misunderstood'. Jackson sat down with CBS News to discuss his police department, racial issues in Ferguson and the riots that occurred in the St. Louis suburb throughout the fall. 'There is not a racial problem in the police department. We clearly have a racial divide that is perceived by a large part of the community,' Jackson said. Scroll down for video . This was Jackson's first network interview since the St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting and killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown . He added that there is no racial profiling happening in Ferguson. 'I challenge that anyone was harassed (by police). Racial profiling is not only prohibited, but it's illegal,' he said. Jackson went on to say that his officers have been under a lot of pressure since August, when Brown was shot dead. 'They've taken a lot of abuse. They've been assaulted quite a bit. I think it's taken its toll on them,' he said in the interview. Consultants have looked into the police department, Jackson said. Some were hired by the Department of Justice in order to look at work flow and staffing. The police chief's hope is that Ferguson can have more officers on the streets and participating in community outreach. He added that the force is recruiting African Americans and that more minority candidates have applied than had before it was announced Wilson would not be indicted. The police force was 'just overwhelmed' by the riots that occurred after the announcement and the force had no help from the National Guard during the first night of riots. The police force was 'just overwhelmed' by the riots that occurred after the court ruled not to indict Wilson for killing Michael Brown (pictured), and that the night of the announcement, the force had no help from the National Guard . This interview comes after it was announced that the Department of Justice is expected not to charge Wilson for the shooting of Brown. Justice Department officials are, however, planning to sue the Ferguson Police Department for racially discriminatory practices unless the department agrees to make changes, CNN reported. The shooting of Brown became one of the focal points in the debate over unjust policing in the United States and led to a federal probe of both the incident and the Ferguson police department. The probe included Justice officials conducting a 'patterns and practices' investigation of the police department and a separate investigation to determine if Wilson violated Brown's civil rights. After a St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict and Missouri authorities concluded an investigation without recommending charges, the federal probe is the only remaining investigation probing whether to charge Wilson. Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr did not provide a comment for the CNN report. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week at a National Press Club event he is 'confident' there will be a decision before the nominee to be his replacement, Loretta Lynch, is confirmed by the Senate. Attorney General Eric Holder's Justice Department is expected not to charge Darren Wilson, the officer whose killing of unarmed teenager Mike Brown led to protests in Ferguson and throughout the country . Wilson resigned from the force in November, days after the grand jury announcement, which set off looting and fires that destroyed several businesses in and around Ferguson. The shooting months earlier had already spurred weeks of sometimes violent protests and a national debate over race relations and police use of force. Less than a week before Holder's announcement, St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch vigorously defended his handling of the Ferguson police shooting during a law school lecture at his alma mater, ignoring protesters who repeatedly disrupted his speech. Minutes after the lecture at a Saint Louis University academic symposium on policing began, an audience member wearing a judicial robe interrupted to accuse the elected prosecutor of misconduct for his office's role in the grand jury process that ended with Darren Wilson not being indicted. Campus police escorted several protesters from the room at the request of school President Fred Pestello. Meanwhile, McCulloch continued giving his speech as people in the crowd kept making comments, their voices often competing with his. One of the lecture's organizers banged a gavel in an unsuccessful attempt to restore order.","Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson gave first network interview since grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting Michael Brown .

"One of Australia's most powerful women is at loggerheads with top Cabinet Ministers over her attempts to micro manage Julie Bishop and steal Joe Hockey's thunder, it has been reported. The disdain felt amongst numerous MPs towards Peta Credlin, the prime minister's right hand woman and the person he credits with securing his party's election, has come to light and exposes the over-reaching responsibilities she has assumed - from picking Tony Abbott's blue ties to taking part in the budget's development. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is understood to have been involved in a feud with Credlin after her extensive attempt to micro manage the government included controlling minister's media appearances, according to John Lyons of The Australian. Scroll down for video . The disdain felt amongst numerous MPs towards Peta Credlin, the prime minister's chief of staff, has come to light . They claim the over-reaching responsibilities she has assume include picking Tony Abbott's blue ties and taking part in the budget's development . In an incident that fractured their relationship, Bishop slammed Credlin who voiced her disapproval of a media appearance by the minister that had not been authorized by Credlin. Bishop is said to have reminded Abbott's chief of staff that she was the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and did not require her permission. The parliamentary strife comes amidst reports that Mr Abbott proposed an Australian-led invasion of Iraq to his top Australian military advisors - who blanched at the idea - a move that Credlin showed no opposition to, according to The Australian. Meanwhile, Treasurer Joe Hockey's grievances with Credlin are also understood to have stemmed from her tendency to over-step her mark and take control. At a small celebration following the release of the party's first budget, Credlin undermined the Treasurer by having the first word - leading the toast, and ultimately taking ownership of an accomplishment that should have been Hockey's to savour, The Australian reports.

Credlin also stole Joe Hockey's (right) thunder at a small celebration following the release of the party's first budget, where she undermined the Treasurer by having the first word . The incident symbolises the over-reaching role that Credlin has taken on. Aside from her responsibilities of managing staff, Credlin decides who runs each minister's office, often answers media's questions directed at Mr Abbott and ultimately chooses who can speak to him and when. New claims that she had on occasion led the Expenditure Review Committee and determined the agenda, were quickly denied by Finance Minister Mathias Cormann on Saturday morning who told Sky News that 'never never happened'. Backbenchers have even revealed to The Australian that a popular term amongst the Liberals is 'Credlined' AKA 'to be beheaded', a term that compliments her well known nickname, 'The Queen of No'. But Abbott's devotion to Credlin is unmoving. The prime minister has defended her time and time again, calling her 'the fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with'.

"Statins are not as safe or effective at preventing heart attacks as patients have been led to believe . The benefits of taking statins have been exaggerated, two leading experts claim. They say the cholesterol-lowering medicines – hailed as miracle drugs when they hit the market 20 years ago – are not as safe or effective at preventing heart attacks as patients have been led to believe. Although they can dramatically cut cholesterol levels, they have ‘failed to substantially improve cardiovascular outcomes’, says an analysis of data in clinical trials. It was carried out by Dr David Diamond, a professor of molecular pharmacology at the University of South Florida, and expert in cardiovascular disease Dr Uffe Ravnskov. They say many studies touting statins’ efficacy have failed to note serious side effects. They also claim ‘statistical deception’ has been used to make inflated claims about their effectiveness, which has misled the public. The two authors say in the analysis, published in the Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology: ‘The adverse effects suffered by people taking statins are more common than reported in the media and at medical conferences. ‘Increased rates of cancer, cataracts, diabetes, cognitive impairments and musculoskeletal disorders more than offset the modest cardiovascular benefits of statin treatment.’ They conclude: ‘There is a great appeal to the public to take a pill that offers the promise of a longer life and to live heart attack free. ‘The reality, however, is that statins actually produce only small beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes, and their adverse effects are far more substantial than is generally known.’ In July, NHS rationing body Nice said statins should be given to 17million patients, almost 40 per cent of the adult population. The US experts say those who champion the medication have often presented data in a way that exaggerates the benefits. In July  Nice said statins should be given to 17million patients - almost 40 per cent of the adult population . ‘Statin advocates have used statistical deception to create the illusion that statins are “wonder drugs,” when the reality is that their modest benefits are more than offset by their adverse effects’, they claim. The analysis takes a critical look at the Jupiter Trial and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA). It claims that in the Jupiter trial, the public and doctors were told of a 54 per cent reduction in heart attacks, when the actual reduction was less than 1 percentage point. In the ASCOT-LLA study, the improvement in patient outcomes with Lipitor treatment was 1.1 percentage points, said the analysis. But when this study was presented to the public, US advertisements transformed this into a 36 per cent cut in the risk of having a heart attack. The inflated claims and playing down of the adverse effects have helped to boost enthusiasm for the cholesterol-lowering drugs among health care providers and the public, say the authors.","Cholesterol-lowering statins hailed as miracle drugs when first hit market .

"New rules: Theresa May accepted findings criticising police spying after the MoS report . Police will be banned from using anti-terror laws to spy on journalists to identify their sources, following a Mail on Sunday campaign. The Home Office is to issue new instructions to police forces requiring them to seek authorisation from a judge before they can gain access to journalists’ phone records and other communications data. It said the measure was being introduced as an ‘interim solution’ pending new legislation after the Election. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May accepted the findings of an official inquiry triggered by a Mail on Sunday report that revealed how police trawled through phone records of this newspaper’s news desk in a bid to identify a confidential source. The review by the Interception of Communications Commissioner (ICC) strongly criticised the way police had used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to access journalists’ data. Police forces were found to have viewed the phone records of 82 journalists over the last three years via Ripa while failing to give adequate consideration to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (freedom of expression). Our report in October revealed that Kent Police detectives used Ripa to sidestep a judge’s ruling and snoop into The Mail on Sunday news editor’s telephone records in order to identify the source in the Chris Huhne speeding points story. The following day, a review of the use of Ripa powers was launched by the ICC. The same law was used to trawl through the phone records of a Sun journalist in the Plebgate row. Since then, many of those who helped draw up the original legislation, largely aimed at combating organised crime and terrorists, have admitted that the use of the law to spy on journalists was never envisaged. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, (pictured left) said it is 'deeply disturbing that police hacked into offices of a major newspaper'. (Right) The MoS report on police spying . Yesterday it was announced that police forces will now be told they must use the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which requires them to obtain the permission of a judge if they want to obtain details of a journalist’s phonecalls or emails. The Government will also amend the Serious Crime Bill currently going through Parliament to ensure that a revised code of practice has ‘due regard to the public interest in protecting journalists’ sources’. ‘A free press is fundamental to a free society. The Government has accepted in full the recommendations of the ICC and we are determined to implement them as soon as is legally possible,’ a Home Office spokesman said. ‘So we are legislating as far as possible now until a Bill can be introduced in the next Parliament which delivers the recommendations in full.’ Former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who piloted Ripa through Parliament, said a long-term solution was needed. ‘It is better than nothing but something much more dramatic needs to be done. The long-term solution has got to be primary legislation,’ he told Radio 4’s Today programme. At the time of our revelation, MPs warned that police use of Ripa to spy on journalists was a disproportionate use of power that would deter whistleblowers from approaching the media. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘It is deeply disturbing that police hacked into offices of a major newspaper. They have struck a serious blow against press freedom.’","Police to be banned from using anti-terror laws to spy on journalists .

"The father who raised over $500,000 to help raise his Down syndrome son after claiming his wife abandoned the little boy because of the 'shame' he brought on her family, was previously charged with assaulting his first wife's father, it has been reported. Almost 18,000 people donated money to Samuel Forrest who said he was trying to bring his son Leo to his native New Zealand after his wife, Ruzan Badalyan, filed for divorce just one week after their son's birth in Armenia on January 21. Earlier this month, it was revealed Mr Forrest travelled to Armenia four years ago after divorcing and his first wife Kylie Forrest, and losing contact with the three daughters and one son they had together in Whanganui on New Zealand's north island. Reports have now emerged that in March of 2010, Mr Forrest - who has not yet left Armenia - was fined $530 after being convicted of assaulting his then father-in-law before he fled the country, according to The New Zealand Herald. Samuel Forrest, who  split from his wife just a week after their son Leo was born with Down syndrome in Armenia on January 21, was convicted of assaulting his first wife's father in 2010 . A former housemate of Mr Forrest's told the newspaper: 'He told me why he did it. [His father-in-law] was making some physical changes, meddling in his house, and yet Sam was not allowed to go there.' His ex-wife has denied earlier reports that their youngest daughter was born with Down syndrome, clarifying that she had been born with medical complications after a premature birth. She also slammed claims by her ex-husband that, as a member of the Exclusive Brethren church, he was ex-communicated when he divorced her and was banned from seeing his four children, now aged between six and 15 years old. 'He chose to leave the marriage and the church…and he has put it around the other way,' Ms Forrest told The New Zealand Herald. 'He still has legal access arrangements, it was his choice not to see them,' she said of their children. Mr Forrest left New Zealand four years ago after divorcing his wife Kylie Forrest, who claims he abandoned his four young children (pictured). She denied earlier reports that their youngest daughter was born with Down syndrome, clarifying that she had been born with medical complications after a premature birth . Mr Forrest, said his second wife abandoned their son Leo (pictured) because her family were ashamed of his condition, has made global headlines since he started crowd fundraising to bring Leo to his native New Zealand . In a series of emails around the time he left the church, Mr Forrest repeatedly says he 'lost four innocent children' and blames the Exclusive Brethren for the 'deliberate break-up of a family'. Daily Mail Australia has obtained a photo of Mr Forrest with his four children before he lost contact with them in 2011. 'All his extended family are also members of the Exclusive Brethren and are still forbidden by their religion to have any contact with him,' a source said. 'It was one of the reasons why he left in the first place and went to Armenia. He had no contact with his children and saw no future for himself in New Zealand. It was all very sad.' Mr Forrest married his Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan 18 months ago and they divorced a week after baby Leo was born on January 21 . Mr Forrest's crowd funding website has already raised more than $600,000 in his bid to bring up baby Leo in Auckland where he can have access to established disability services . Mr Forrest married his Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan 18 months ago and they divorced a week after baby Leo was born. At the time, Mr Forrest said his wife refused to look at or even touch Leo because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like Down syndrome brings shame on the entire family. She has been under scrutiny since her decision to give up Leo was made public. Mr Forrest, who was brought up as a member of the Exclusive Brethren church in New Zealand. His ex-wife denied that he was ec-communicated after he divorced her, saying: 'he chose to leave the marriage and the church…and he has put it around the other way' Mr Forrest wrote on his crowd-funding website on Monday that he 'still feels a great deal of love' for his ex-wife despite her decision to give up their son. 'I can assure you that I have tried my best to convince my wife we could keep the baby, but in her family, an orphanage seemed a safer option for Armenia,' he wrote. 'I did everything I could to keep our family together, including suggesting we all go to New Zealand together. Her family also spent time trying to persuade me to surrender our son to an orphanage. 'Ruzan should not be the target of all of the frustrations that this situation has created. Our paths may be moving in different directions, but she is Leo's mother and I still feel a great deal of love for her.' It comes after Ms Badalyan hit back at her ex-husband's claims she abandoned her baby, instead saying she had to make a 'ruthless decision' in the best interests of Leo. She released a statement via Facebook saying the long-awaited birth of her son was the happiest day, but when she woke she could only see alarmed faces around her. 'My first question was about the whereabouts of my child. I remember the sad faces of my relatives and the doctors and the diagnosis that sounded like a verdict: 'Your child was born with a Down Syndrome.' One can never imagine my feelings at that moment,' she wrote. 'Hardly had I recovered from the first shock, when the doctor approached me and told me to voice my decision whether I was going to keep Leo or not. I had to make the most ruthless decision in my life within several hours. At the time of Leo's birth, Mr Forrest said his wife refused to look at or even touch Leo because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like Down syndrome brings shame on the entire family . Mr Forrest wrote on his crowd-funding website on Monday that he 'still feels a great deal of love' for his ex-wife despite her decision to give up their son . 'The first thing that came to my mind after the diagnosis was that I don't want my child to live in a country where certain stereotypes dominate the lives of people with DS and no opportunities at all. I want him to be involved and well-received in society, an integration that will require years and years for our society to adjust to. 'I saw the evasive looks of the doctors, my relatives' tear-stained faces, received calls of condolences and realised that only a move to a country with such standards as New Zealand would entitle my son to a decent life.' Leo's mother said the cost of raising a children with a disability also weighed on her. 'In Armenia every child is loved and respected and family is a high value, but in this country children with special needs do require special attention, huge financial resources and dedication,' she said. 'In the hardest moment of my life when my husband should be next to me and support and help to take the right decision, I could not find any support from his side. 'After that incident, he left the hospital notifying me hours later that he was taking the kid with him, that he is going to leave the country for New Zealand and I do not have anything to do with the situation.' Ms Badalyan (pictured here on her wedding day) hit back at her ex-husband's claims she abandoned her baby, instead saying she had to make a 'ruthless decision' in the best interests of Leo . Leo's mother said the cost of raising a children with a disability also weighed on her and described the decision as the 'hardest moment of my life' Ruzan Badalyn (left) pictured at her wedding alongside her sister Arevik will remain in Armenia after filing for divorce for her New Zealand husband . Mr Forrest's crowd funding website has already raised more than $490,000 in his bid to bring up baby Leo in Auckland where he can have access to established disability services and adequate support. But it is unclear how much family support he will receive when he returns. 'It's well known within the Exclusive Brethren community that Sam has been cut off by everyone because of divorcing his wife. He has no one to come back to,' a source said. 'You would hope that he'd get some support but it's very unlikely.' Mr Forrest has been left stunned by the outpouring of support since he first shared his story. The outpouring of kind emotions and great wishes has been overwhelming. Leo is one lucky guy,' he said. 'He is doing well and is very healthy. He gets visitors daily who shower him with love and affection. Leo is the number one priority for me right now and needs all my attention.' He said the money raised was far beyond what they expected or needed. The money will be used find a house in Auckland and to give Leo education opportunities. There are also plans to use some of the funds to support parents in Armenia who are raising children with disabilities. For more information on Leo's cause, visit www.gofundme.com/bringleohome.

"Karl Rominger, 41, has been charged with stealing $535,135 of his clients' money, which he used to fund gambling trips at casinos . The former attorney for Penn state football coach Jerry Sandusky has been charged with stealing $535,135 of his clients' money, which he used to fund gambling trips at casinos and other personal interests. Karl Rominger, 41, who represented Sandusky during his child-sex abuse trial, allegedly misappropriated funds from clients that include a car accident victim, the spouse of a divorced couple and the survivors of a woman's estate. Rominger apologized to the former clients he had 'wronged'. 'I look forward to accepting the consequences and putting this behind me, while making restitution,' he said, according to PennLive.com. Cumberland County investigators filed 25 charges for theft and fund misappropriation on Friday. They said Rominger could still face more charges as the investigation is not yet complete. In his affidavit, chief detective Les Freehling wrote that Rominger's financial records were in such a state of 'disarray' that it had been hard to account for additional possible losses. Rominger came under investigation last year after he failed to materialize $147,883 from the sale of a marital home during a divorce case, Freehling said. It was then discovered that $800,000 in client money was missing from a bank account under the former attorney's control. Rominger, who said he hasn't gambled since last March, voluntarily surrendered his law license and is currently free on $250,000 bail. District Attorney David Freed said there is still at least 'one other substantial situation' being investigated. He added that investigators have also yet to be given access to all of Rominger's files due to claims of attorney-client privilege.

"Two years ago the Krespanis family upped their whole life and moved  nearly 100km north-west of Melbourne to the small town of Kyneton to raise their young family on a farm, hoping for a better life for their two kids. Now they are dealing with the devastating death of their 22-month-old son Noah, who died on Thursday after being left in a hot car outside a daycare centre. Speaking to The Age, shocked members of the Kyneton community expressed their dismay over the tragic accident telling of the family's love for their children, growing vegetables and raising their own pigs and chickens. Scroll down for video . Pictures have emerged of 22-month-old Noah, who died after being left in a hot car outside a day care centre on Thursday . Noah Krespanis was found in a car parked outside a home on Acacia Drive in Kyneton in 31 degree heat. The car window was smashed in order to rescue Noah but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. The toddler was found unconscious by a family member while strapped in a car seat in the Toyota Hilux parked outside the home about 3pm on Thursday. It has been reported that temperatures would have reached up to 60 degrees inside the car on the hot Summer day. A family member told the newspaper that the parents of the toddler are absolutely inconsolable. 'He was just a gorgeous little boy. But I don't want to say 'was' or I think I'll start crying,' they said. The family member said Noah's parents believed the move to Kyneton was right for their two kids. 'It was better for the kids: the air is fresher, it's a better environment to raise children,' the family member said. 'No one imagined this.' Noah's distraught father posted an emotional social media message on Thursday, urging parents to 'cherish every day' they get to spend with their children. The toddler was found unconscious by a family member while strapped in a car seat in the Toyota Hilux parked outside the home about 3pm on Thursday . The body of an infant boy was found in a vehicle on Acacia Drive in Kyneton (pictured) on Thursday . Taking to his Twitter page, a devastated Mr Krespanis paid tribute to his son making a heartfelt plea to parents urging them to hug their children and 'never let them go'. 'We lost our beautiful son today,' he wrote on the social media account on Thursday. 'Hug your children. Hug them and never let them go.' 'I love him more every day. Forever.' he said, referring to his baby boy. 'I'll always know I cherished every day. Every laugh, every adventure, every cuddle. Miss you noey X.' Mr Krespanis' post comes just hours after it was revealed that Noah's mother is too distraught to speak to police. Homicide squad Detective Senior Sergeant Shane O'Connell said the mother was present when he was found in the car, but said police investigating the incident would not speak to her for days, the Herald Sun reported. 'As you can imagine the family of this young boy are devastated by what has occurred so it's been difficult for us to try and piece together exactly what has occurred but that's something that will be the focus of our major ongoing investigation,' Det Sen Sgt O'Connell said. 'She's absolutely devastated by what has occurred. It's a very tragic set of circumstances.' The owner of a separate local childcare centre said they were heartbroken over the tragedy . The childcare centre where a 22-month-old boy was found dead in a hot car parked outside was privately-run and operated out of a family home . The woman who operates the family day care is part of a well-known local family and runs the business from her house, The Age reported. The family day care's father said his daughter was 'distraught', but said the family would not be speaking publicly until police had finished their investigation. There is no suggestion the childcare centre owner was involved in Noah's death. Police are investigating whether a female relative of the 22-month-old had forgotten the child was in the vehicle. The 22-month-old boy was apparently found by a family member . Victorian homicide detectives are trying to establish whether the woman mistakenly thought she had dropped the toddler at a childcare centre in the morning before continuing with her regular routine, the Herald Sun reported. Temperatures in Kyneton reached 31 degrees at the time of the tragedy. The woman ran a regulated family day care service through Bambini Child Care Services, a company that trains educators to take care of children from their home. A spokeswoman for Family Day Care Australia, of which Bambini is a member, said: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and all those affected by this tragedy.' They refused to comment on any other details while police were conducting inquiries. The owner of a separate local business - Kyneton Family Day Care - posted on her Facebook page: 'The only information I can give regarding the accident in Kyneton this afternoon is that I am absolutely heartbroken for the family and my friend.' Inspector Ryan Irwin said at the scene: 'I understand the boy has been found by a family member and paramedics were called and obviously there were attempts made to try and revive the child.' Insp Irwin said homicide squad detectives would oversee the investigation, and called the incident an 'absolute tragedy'. 'We're devastated,' Inspector Irwin said, according to the Herald Sun. '[The family are] devastated, absolutely devastated and we're still trying to track some family members down to actually notify them.' Officers were still at the scene on Acacia Drive in Kyneton, 100km north-west of Melbourne hours after the awful discovery. Neighbours of the house the baby boy was found outside said the residency doubled as a childcare centre, the ABC reported. Neighbours of the house the baby boy was found outside said the residency doubled as a childcare centre . Homicide detectives have been called into the investigation but this is 'common procedure' according to police. Ambulance Victoria would not comment on the latest case, but has issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars. In the first five weeks of the year, paramedics were called to 200 cases. Most recently, a young girl had to be rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital after being locked in a hot vehicle at Maribyrnong, 4km west of Melbourne, for just half an hour after her mother couldn't open the doors. 'The girl was sweating profusely and her clothes were drenched, so there was certainly potential for it to quickly become life threatening,' advanced life support paramedic Ben Dalton said. 'The MFB smashed a window to get the girl out of the car.' Mr Dalton said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in Victoria, and it's frustrating the message is not getting through. 'Children can't regulate their body temperature like adults can, which puts them at significant risk,' he said. 'It's never okay to leave a child locked in a car, even for a minute or two.' The state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars, with fines up to $3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months. The suburb, which is about 100km north-west of Melbourne, recorded temperatures of 31 degrees . It comes after Ambulance Victoria were called in to help at least six young children locked in hot cars in separate incidents last week, and a total of 200 children in the first five weeks of 2015 .","The Krespanis family moved to Kyneton two years ago .

"Britain and the West should start arming Ukrainian troops to help them fight back against heavily-armed Russian-backed rebels, ex-Defence Secretary Liam Fox has said. Dr Fox raised fears that the credibility of the entire Nato alliance was now at stake, claiming that the bitter battle in eastern Ukraine had raised the ‘shadow of conflict’ in Europe for the first time since the Cold War ended. The Conservative MP said it was now crucial that Kiev had the means to defend itself against the separatists who used state-of-the-art Russian weapons to overrun the key town of Debaltseve, despite a ceasefire brokered by Germany and France. Onslaught: Smoke from intense fighting can still be seen in the air as Russia-backed rebels gesture riding on an armored vehicle after taking key point Debaltseve . Forced out: Ukrainian servicemen stand at the checkpoint near Roty village, not far from Debaltseve. Former defence secretary Liam Fox says the west needs to arm them against Russia-backed rebels . He said: ‘Specifically, what we should be giving them is encrypted communications, because at moment the old systems they are using make them a sitting target for the Russians whose technology is much better. ‘They need anti-tank weapons because the Russians are using new, better-armoured vehicles against which the Ukrainians have no defence. Thirdly, they need UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] for targeting. ‘We should be giving them the weapons they need to defend themselves against an external threat. This is about their territorial integrity.’ European powers have so far drawn back from arming Kiev, amid fears it could fuel the conflict, although US president Barack Obama has indicated he would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine if the Russians do not pull back. Nato chiefs have also warned that escalating tensions with Russia could explode into all-out war. Russian-backed rebels celebrate the capture of Debaltseve  by a road sign to the entrance to the city. Ex-defence secretary Liam Fox says it is up to Britain and the west needs to arm them against Russia-backed rebels . Formidable: Putin vowed to step up an ambitious military modernisation, with hundreds of new combat jets, missiles and other weapons Despite an economic downturn caused by low oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine, Russia's military budget has risen by one-third this year . But Dr Fox echoed a warning last week by current Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that there was a ‘real and present danger’ that Russian president Vladimir Putin could use similar tactics to destabilise the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – which, unlike Ukraine, are members of Nato – unless the alliance stood up to him. Dr Fox said the Ukrainian conflict ‘has actually brought the shadow of conflict to the European continent, certainly for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall. This is a very serious issue. It is also about the credibility of Nato and the Western alliance. I think the defence of the Baltic, for example begins in Ukraine.’ He added: ‘Here is an alliance where only four of its members meet its defence obligations in terms of spending. They all want to have the insurance policy but they don’t want to pay the premiums. We now need to examine exactly what Nato is going to be doing in this crisis, what its credibility is. ‘Will we now step up to the mark, will we put a military presence in the Baltic states and recognise we are getting close to a position where Russia will threaten Nato in its own territory?’ Yesterday, US secretary of state John Kerry warned Russia the west will not tolerate its 'unacceptable' actions in Ukraine - as thousands of pro-Kremlin supporters took to the streets of Moscow. Speaking during a visit to London, he accused Moscow of 'craven behaviour' in its support for the rebels, undermining the ceasefire 10 days ago. He warned deeper sanctions are set to be imposed against Russia's 'landgrabbing in Ukraine,' at the talks with UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Sanctions: UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond meets with United States secretary of state John Kerry for talks on the Ukraine crisis. Further economic sanctions against Russia have been suggested . 'We are confident that over the next few days we are going to make it clear that we are not going to play this game, not going to sit here and be part of this extraordinarily craven behavior at the expense of the sovereignty and integrity of a nation,' he said. 'This is behavior that is completely counter to everything that the global community has worked to achieve and put in place ever since World War II, and I'm confident that the United Kingdom, the United States and others are prepared to stand up to it.' The warning follows the fierce separatist offensive to take the key strategic town of Debaltseve which saw a chaotic withdrawal by Ukrainian soldiers this week. Kiev and the rebels have accused each other of keeping up the attacks with Ukrainian forces  reporting attacks that killed one serviceman and wounded another 40 on Saturday, as mortars hit the outskirts of Mariupol. Problems: John Kerry accused Russia of 'land-grabbing in Ukraine.' He blasted Putin's (right) denial of involvement and said there were 'no secrets' in this age of modern technology . Rebels claim Ukrainian forces shelled 15 locations overnight, including parts of its stronghold Donetsk. Mr Kerry also blasted Moscow's repeated denials that it is involved in arming the separatists and sending its own troops over the border saying satellite technology meant there is 'no secret' over what was happening. 'We know to a certainty what Russia has been providing to the separatists, how Russia is involved with the separatists,' he said. Despite the ceasefire seeming on the brink of collapse, a prisoner exchange is being carried out on the front line, with Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko announcing the handover had began on Twitter. Ukraine's military and pro-Russian separatists began exchanging scores of prisoners each had taken, in the first stage of one of the key points of the peace deal. 'In the near time, 140 of our heroes will be free,' he wrote on Saturday. A year on: Ukraine is commemorating the first anniversary of the  sniper attacks that killed dozens of protesters on the Maidan and were followed by the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich . It has been reported the rebels are swapping 140 Ukrainian soldiers for 52 of their fighters held by the other side. Today's exchange is being carried out as part of a UN-backed truce that has been violated many times since coming into effect a week ago. Meanwhile, an estimated 40,000 Russians gathered in a central square in Moscow for what they call an 'anti-Maidan' rally to show their support for Putin and condemning the 'coup' in neighbouring Ukraine. People attend an 'Anti-Maidan' rally to protest against the 2014 Kiev uprising, which ousted President Viktor Yanukovich . In a sea of red, banners were waved with messages including 'Putin is our president' and 'We don’t need western ideology and gay parades'. Thousands of Russians marched in Moscow on Saturday, carrying banners and signs disavowing the protests at Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, . The latest developments come as military chiefs warned yesterday that Britain has entered a new Cold War with Russia, as Vladimir Putin threatened anyone who tried to pressure his country. The Russian leader said 'no one should have any illusions that it's possible to achieve military superiority over Russia or apply any kind of pressure on it'. Adding that his forces would always have an 'adequate response', he vowed to step up an ambitious military modernisation, with hundreds of new combat jets, missiles and other weapons. Ukrainian President Petro Porosheno on 20 February had accused Russia of masterminding the killings of more than 100 protesters in Kiev one year ago. His comments sparked renewed concern about the UK's capability to cope in the event of a conflict with Russia. RAF fighter jets were scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles off the Cornwall coast. Russian military planes, ships and submarines have made at least 17 incursions close to the UK since the start of 2014 as Moscow tests Western response times. Britain's top military commander in Nato, General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, spoke of an 'era of constant competition with Russia', while a former RAF chief Sir Michael Graydon said the UK was in 'a different sort of Cold War.'","Europe facing first 'shadow of conflict' since the Cold War - Fox .

"A landscape gardener is trumpeting the great British creation of the bandstand after touring the country's parks to study the iconic structures for a new book. Paul Rabbitts, 49, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, was inspired to research Britain's bandstands in 2011 after acting as a consultant for the restoration of the one in Albert Park, Middlesbrough. He looked into the history of the bandstand and discovered what happened to the 1,200 that were built between the 1860s through to the Second World War. Then: The bandstand in Albert Park, Middlesbrough, still exists today. It was built in 1871 and was re-erected in 2005 . Now: The bandstand in Albert Park, Middlesbrough. The park itself was  first opened in 1868 and remains open to this day . Mr Rabbitts has now charted the demise and resurgence of hundreds of the outdoor theatres that have graced pleasure gardens and seafront proms in cities and towns from Dundee to Dover for 150 years. Many of the country's bandstands were broken up during the Second World War as the ironwork used for railings was melted down to make ammunition and weapons. Mr Rabbitts' book, Bandstands of Britain, documents dozens of these structures that have been restored to their former glory over the last 20 years using money from the National Lottery. Then: The Birdcage, West Pier, Brighton was built in 1884 and still stands today. Undated photograph . Now: The Birdcage, West Pier, Brighton pictured today. Paul Rabbitts was inspired to research  bandstands after helping to restore one . Then: The bandstand in Ventor Park, Ventor, which was built in 1887. Around 1,200 were built from the 1860s through to the Second World War . Now: The bandstand in Ventor Park, Ventor, where it still stands today. It was lucky - many were broken up during the Second World War as the iron used for railings was melted down to make ammunition and weapons . It also pays homage to some of the 900 structures that have been lost to the nation over the years and those that have simply been left to ruin. His book is also a celebration of the elaborate architecture and ironwork that went into building beautiful bandstands in the 19th century, a creation that was copied in many countries across the world. Mr Rabbitts, a local council parks' manager, said: 'Bandstands are a great British invention and have been a feature of our way of life for well over a century. 'They were not just a focal point for a park but they provided a stage to perform live music, too. 'During their heyday in the Victorian era, bandstands were enormously popular and drew crowds of up to 10,000. Then: The Bandstand at Temple Gardens and Arboretum, Lincoln, was built in 1884 . Now: The colourful bandstand at Temple Gardens and Arboretum, Lincoln, pictured today . 'Sadly many fell into disuse and were neglected and many were demolished as public parks and seaside resorts went into a spiral of decline in the 1980s and 1990s. 'In 1997 the Heritage Lottery Fund started investing in our public parks and gardens and this has seen the rediscovery of bandstands which has continued to this day. 'And they aren't being used just for live music, but also for theatre, drama and opera.' Then: A little girl poses by the bandstand at North Lodge Park, Darlington, which was built in 1903 . Now: The bandstand at North Lodge Park, Darlington, pictured today. It is currently kept boarded up while not in use . Although a pavilion in Vauxhall Gardens in London was built in the 1700s to house bands to play classical music to large crowds, bandstands only started popping up after the industrial revolution in the 19th century. Paul said: 'Towns grew rapidly and open spaces were built on. In the 1820s politicians noticed the working class spent much of their spare time in pubs. 'They set about creating municipal parks for the industrial terrace-dwellers to relax in and listen to music and from there the bandstand evolved.' The first towns to build a bandstand included Leeds, which once had 18 compared to just one today, Sheffield, Bradford, Rochdale and London. Seaside resorts like Brighton, Eastbourne and Paignton followed the trend, with each trying to outdo the other with their ornate designs. Then: The bandstand at Exhibtion Park, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, was built in 1877 . Now: The bandstand at Exhibtion Park, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, pictured today . Paul said: 'A lot of bandstands disappeared during the Second World War as the iron was needed to be melted down. 'After the war the advent of the record player, television and cinema resulted in bandstands to fall into mass decline. 'Out of nearly 1,200 bandstands about 350 original ones are standing today.. Another 150 or so have been built in modern times.' Bandstands of Britain is published by the History Press and costs £20. The bandstand in Victoria Park, Haslingden, Lancashire.

"Neighbours complained after My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion (pictured) was blasted out by Gareth Davies at his home in Strood, Kent . A music fan had his speakers seized for the third time because he refused to stop playing Celine Dion's classic ballad My Heart Will Go On. Gareth Davies had his belongings confiscated for the first time in March last year after neighbours complained, a court heard. Thousands of pounds worth of equipment including a 3D TV, sound docking station and 32 DVDs were taken by council officers from his home in Strood, Kent. But the 48-year-old didn't take the hint and just two months later council workers had to return. Davies  was fined for seven breaches of a noise abatement notice at  Dartford Magistrates' Court yesterday. He was told his equipment would be permanently forfeited and was fined £50 for each charge. He will also pay £500 costs. After his equipment was confiscated last June, Davies, who has been living in his £80,000 Victorian terraced house since 1988, said he would never speak to his neighbours again. The former window salesman said: 'I'm constantly wondering about the noise now. 'This hasn't solved anything. I'm not going to be able to talk to my neighbours again. 'The thing that surprised me the most, considering I have a 2,000-watt amp, is that they complained about my little Bose docking station.

That's why I ignored the notice - I thought I'd get the chance to defend myself. ‘It felt like it was a witch hunt.

"The Russian rouble collapsed to a record low yesterday as the country’s economic crisis deepened. The Central Bank of Russia raised interest rates from 10.5 to 17 per cent in a desperate effort to prop up the currency. But the move triggered panic among international investors and the rouble tumbled by as much as 21 per cent against the US dollar. Scroll down for video . Money worries: Russia dramatically raised its interest rate from 10.5 to 17 per cent in a desperate effort to prevent the collapse of the rouble and boost the economy. Many experts believe the decline in the economy could eventually lead to President Vladmir Putin being ousted from office . The crisis could weaken President Vladimir Putin’s iron grip on power as analysts warned the currency was in ‘free-fall’. ‘Russia is in a full-blown currency crisis,’ said Alexander Moseley, a fund manager at Schroders, the asset management firm. Harry Adams, managing director of the foreign exchange specialist Argentex, said the rouble had turned to ‘rubble’. The rouble has fallen by nearly 60 per cent against the dollar this year on the back of the tumbling oil price and worries about the outlook for the Russian economy. Oil and gas account for 70 per cent of Russian exports and half of government revenues, making the country vulnerable to falling prices. Crude fell below $59 a barrel yesterday for the first time since May 2009, having traded at $115 as recently as June. Fighting: The surprise announcement comes after the rouble's value has sunk roughly 50 per cent since January - battered by Western sanctions imposed over the Ukraine conflict (pictured) The lower oil price and sanctions imposed on Russia by the West for its land grab in Ukraine have left its fragile economy on the brink of recession. Apple has halted online sales of its iPhones, iPads and other products in Russia amid financial turmoil triggered by the steep decline in the country's currency. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said yesterday that the ruble's instability has made it too difficult to set its prices in Russia, prompting the closure of its online store there. A spokesman told Bloomberg: 'Our online store in Russia is currently unavailable while we review pricing. We apologise to customers for any inconvenience.' The ruble plunged by as much as 20 per cent yesterday, even after Russia's central bank increased interest rates sharply in an attempt to shore up the currency. A one point yesterday, a dollar was worth nearly 80 roubles – compared with around 30 at the start of the year – rekindling memories of Russia’s 1998 financial crisis, when the currency collapsed and the country was forced to default on its debts. The current crisis has piled pressure on Mr Putin. ‘The pieces are falling into place to start to affect the political sustainability of this regime,’ said Nicholas Spiro, of the London consultancy Spiro Sovereign Strategy. Russia’s central bank predicts that the economy will contract by 4.5 per cent in 2015 if oil prices average $60 a barrel throughout the year. The slump in the rouble has driven inflation above 9 per cent by making imports more expensive, and this will hit families and businesses. Sergei Shvetsov, deputy governor of the central bank, said in Moscow yesterday: ‘I couldn’t imagine even a year ago that such a thing would happen, even in my wildest dreams. The situation is critical.’ Lavrov insisted: 'I can assure you that Russia will not only survive but we will come out stronger. We have been in much worse situations in our history and every time, we got out of those fixes much stronger. This will happen this time.' Turmoil: Putin was facing a serious crisis last night after the Russian rouble crashed through the floor, it hit 80 to the dollar, 100 to the euro, and 113 to the Pound at one point and lost 20 per cent in a matter of hours . Overnight, Russia had dramatically raised its interest rate from 10.5 to 17 per cent  in a desperate effort to prevent the collapse of the rouble and boost its stricken economy. The surprise announcement was made at 1am Moscow time and comes after the rouble's value has sunk roughly 50 per cent since January - battered by plunging worldwide oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over the conflict in Ukraine. The move is Russia' largest single rise since 1998, when interest rates soared past 100 per cent and the government defaulted on debt. Russia's economy is threatened by paralysis as the tumbling value of its currency pushes inflation to dangerous levels. The overnight action has somewhat allayed fears, however, prompting an immediate gain in the rouble and leaving it 1.6 per cent up on the Asian stock market. The Bank of Russia's aggressive move illustrated the size of the economic perils confronting Russia and reflected fears that the ruble's decline could trigger consumer panic and incite a run on banks. Russian interest rate: A desperate last-minute hike in interest rates to 17 per cent failed to halt the collapse . By raising interest rates, the central bank hopes investors will find it more financially appealing to keep their money in Russia rather than moving it to Western Europe, Asia or the United States. 'They did it as a lure to encourage people to keep their rubles at home rather than continue to flee the currency and the country,' said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California. 'It's a way of buying time. It doesn't solve any of the underlying issues that the Russian economy has,' he added, referring to falling energy prices, Western sanctions and widespread corruption. Such challenges are especially difficult because Russia's economy relies so heavily on petroleum revenue and lacks the diversification to withstand severe economic downturns. That tends to leave Russia at the mercy of global financial markets, where oil is priced in dollars. The average price of a barrel of oil has dropped below $56 from a summer high of $107. Historic: The move is Russia' largest single rise since 1998, when interest rates soared past 100 per cent, the government defaulted on debt, and people queued on Moscow's streets to withdraw their savings (pictured) The Russian government recently downgraded its growth forecast for next year, predicting that the economy will sink into recession. Still, the Bank of Russia's latest action carries dangers of its own. Vital: The Russian economy is reliant on the price of oil extracted from its Siberian rigs (pictured) By jacking up rates to try to contain inflation, it risks inflicting further economic damage, Eichengreen noted. Though high interest rates can attract investor money, they can also stifle growth by making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend. The announcement in Moscow came after U.S. and European markets had closed. Stocks have suffered in recent days amid the steady drop in global oil prices. The sell-off could continue if investors view the Bank of Russia's move as ineffective. The central bank has gradually raised the rate from 5.5 per cent early this year to 17 per cent now. Last Thursday, it tried unsuccessfully to stem the ruble's slide by boosting its key rate by 1 per cent point to 10.5 per cent. It cited a surge in consumer prices and a 'significant inflation risk.' The Bank of Russia said then that it expected prices to rise 10 percent for 2014 and climb further in the first quarter of 2015. But the ruble plunged further yesterday, dropping from 55 rubles to the dollar on Thursday to about 65 rubles to the dollar by the close of the markets last night. A falling currency increases the cost of imports, stoking inflationary pressures. At the same time, plunging oil prices limit the government's ability to fight a downturn and forces it to borrow more. The sanctions imposed by the West have magnified Russia's economic turmoil. In September, the United States and the European Union announced a new round of sanctions over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine, which included blocking Western financial markets to key Russian companies and limiting imports of some technologies. The additional sanctions were expected to cause enough pain to put Russia into recession for one or two years, predicted economist Alexei Kudrin, who served as finance minister under President Vladimir Putin for 11 years until 2011. The potential for a prolonged downturn caused investors to pull their money from the country, causing the ruble to further lose value.","Vladimir Putin was facing the most serious crisis of his leadership .

"Charged: Teacher Megan Connors is charged with having sex with a student, 15, during school hours . A 30-year-old math teacher employed at a middle school in Plant, City Florida is accused of having sex with one of her 15-year-old students on numerous occasions. Megan Connors, 30, had sex 'multiple times' with her 15-year-old pupil at Turkey Creek Middle School, says the Hillsborough County Sheriff's office. Connors is charged with sexual battery along with lewd and lascivious battery and lewd conduct, reports The Tampa Tribune. Police say that Connors began an inappropriate relationship with the boy in January that began with kissing and later led to fondling. As the relationship progressed Connors and her student allegedly began having sex during school hours in classrooms. Connors is said to have used administrative powers to have the boy removed from his classes so that the two could rendezvous. Police say that Connors once drove the student from the school to his house where they had sex in his bedroom. An investigation is ongoing and as of now no other students are believed to be involved. Connors, who began working at the school in August, was removed from her classroom about a week ago after the school suspected she might be having sexual relations with a student half her age. Connors will be fired from her school and may also lose her teaching certificate. 'We are disappointed. We have so many teachers who are doing a great job. This teacher had nothing in her background that indicated any problems. It's shocking and disappointing,' said the school in a statement on Friday night.

"Souleymane S has said he is 'really afraid' after being shoved off the Paris Metro by a group of Chelsea fans for being black . The man at the centre of the racism storm engulfing Chelsea has said he is 'afraid' to go back on the Paris Metro after he was pushed off a train by fans for being black. Souleymane S, who does not wish his last name to be reported, was on his way home to his young family when he the incident happened at around 7.30pm on Tuesday at the Richelieu-Drouot station. The 33-year-old had left the Left Bank office, where he works as a sales manager, after a 10-hour day keen to get back to his wife three children, aged six, four and three, at their home just outside Paris. But in a shocking confrontation filmed by British expat Paul Nolan on his mobile phone, Souleymane was prevented from boarding a train by a group of Chelsea fans on their way to a Champions League game against Paris St Germain who were heard to be singing racist chants. In an interview on Friday the father-of-three, who was born in Paris to Mauritanian parents, told the Guardian: 'What happened has left me really afraid. 'Frankly I was stunned, I didn't know what to say. 'This is 2015. This talk of black skin or white skin, that's something I don't like and I didn't know why [it was happening].' Souleymane says one member of the group of around 30 or 40 white men pointed at his skin and then to his own, as if to say only one kind was allowed on the train. In the footage he can be seen twice trying to enter the tightly packed carriage, but both times being shoved back out through the train door. He said what happened had not much hurt him physically, but had damaged his morale 'a lot', meaning he will now only use his car and not the Paris underground. Souleymane lost his phone in the scuffle but managed to get on the next train, arriving home to a wife and family with whom he could not bring himself to discuss what happened, unable to believe a group of foreigners had stopped him going home in his own city because of the colour of his skin. He is pictured here in the video trying to get on the train but was immediately forced back by the fans . It was only when a French journalist tracked him down the next day and showed him Mr Nolan's video that he realised he had to speak out about it and make a complaint to police. He said what happened was Chelsea's 'responsibility', and the club have offered him a place in the director's box at Stamford Bridge for the return match against PSG next month. French president François Hollande has called to pledge his personal support. Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's ground following investigations into the incident and face lifetime bans if they're found guilty of any offence . French police have handed the pictures of seven men they believe to be involved to their British counterparts. The Metropolitan Police have also released images of three more Chelsea fans they believe took part. If identified and brought to trial, the suspects could face a three-year prison sentence and €45,000 fine.","The man known only as Souleymane S was shoved off a train by fans singing racist chants before the game against Paris St Germain .

"Council house tenants will be given taxpayer-funded grants of £30,000 or more to help them buy any home under a new government scheme. The money will help them move out of their council house and buy a home somewhere else. Some £84million will be made available over two years. The Right to Buy Social Mobility Fund is aimed at older people who want to downsize or move closer to family. Scroll down for video . The Right to Buy Social Mobility fund will give £84million away in the next two years. Among those eligible are people who need to move to find a job or those who want to downsize . Workers who want to move to find a job and tenants who can't get a mortgage for the property they are living in will also be eligible. It will be open to residents who could otherwise buy the council house in which they live under the Right to Buy scheme. The Government said it wanted to help council house tenants 'trapped in social housing'. Individual grants will total £20,000 for people living outside London and £30,000 in the capital – but these can be topped up with more money from councils. Under the Right to Buy scheme, tenants living somewhere for five years are eligible for discounts of up to £77,000 outside London and £102,700 in London when purchasing the home where they live. The average discount is around £45,000 off the price of the property. The Government said it wanted to help council house tenants 'trapped in social housing'. Under the Right to Buy scheme the average discount is around £45,000 off the price of the property . A document issued yesterday by the Department for Communities and Local Government invited councils to submit bids for the new fund. It said: 'Some social tenants who are able to afford to exercise their Right to Buy are prevented from doing so because the social property in which they live is not suitable for their needs, or is difficult to mortgage. 'Older tenants may wish to move to a different area to be closer to family or into more suitable accommodation; working age tenants may want to move closer to employment opportunities; and some tenants struggle to get a mortgage, for example because they live in a property of non-standard construction.'

"A British soldier who has joined a Kurdish military unit fighting Islamic State is in grave danger of being kidnapped and beheaded, experts have warned. Concerns have been raised for the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment squaddie now thought to be fighting deadly jihadists on the frontline in Northern Syria. The 19-year-old soldier – who once shared a barracks with murdered fusilier Lee Rigby – was based in Cyprus before his shock disappearance. Fears: The 19-year-old British soldier, right, who once shared a barracks with murdered fusilier Lee Rigby, left, is believed to have joined Kurdish forces in Syria . It’s believed he has joined a Kurdish unit called the YPG. Fears for his safety are based on postings on Facebook suggesting a member of the unit has defected to IS. A post appeared on a Facebook page of YPG spokesman Zagros Cudi claiming that one of his comrades had joined IS and that it was now ‘forbidden’ for anyone to contact this individual. A Western source inside the YPG said: ‘If the defector still has contacts in YPG, he could offer them a lot of money to give us up or the British soldier, who would carry the highest price. 'Wherever he goes, there will be a huge price on his head.’ The source added: ‘The British soldier will be sent straight to the frontline in Rojava where there is fierce fighting against IS. 'Unwittingly, perhaps, he has put himself in much more danger than he could have imagined.’ Kurdish expert Professor Gareth Stansfield said: ‘If captured he would be treated as a mercenary and face almost certain death. The publicity value would be enormous.’","Concerns raised for the Pincess of Wales’s Royal Regiment squaddie .

"Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has made another attempt to justify his claims that Barack Obama doesn't love America - claiming it dates back to when the President was nine years old. Giuliani said that the President's lack of affection for his country can be attributed to meeting Communist Party members when he was living in Indonesia 44 years ago. He is facing down a tide of outrage over comments at a fundraising dinner where he criticized the President's attitude towards his country. He told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - that 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.' Scroll down for more . Digging in: Rudy Giuliani, pictured last September, said attributed an apparent lack of affection for America to Communist connections in Obama's early childhood . 'Troubling': Giuliani suggested that Obama's meetings with Communist Party member Frank Marshall Davis, right, when the President-to-be was nine years old, affected his attitude towards America . Democrats, the White House, and even members of the GOP have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician, who was a Presidential contender in 2008. Speaking to the New York Daily News, he said: 'The ideas that are troubling me and are leading to this come from communists with whom he associated when he was nine years old'. He specifically pointed to Frank Marshall Davis, an American communist organizer to whom the young Obama was apparently introduced by his grandfather. The President-to-be was living with Stanley Dunham and his mother Ann Dunham in Indonesia at the time. First contact: Obama, pictured right aged around ten, was apparently introduced to the communist thinker by his grandfather, Stanley Dunham, far left. Center is his mother Ann Dunham . Way back: According to Giuliani, the young Obama (aged eight above) was being inculcated with communist thought as a youth which affects him to this day . Giuliani also cited 'quasi-communist' figures Saul Alinsky, a Chicago community organizer, and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former pastor from whom he has since distanced himself. It was the latest in several attempts by Giuliani to clarify his original remarks. He first told Fox News that he wasn't 'questioning his patriotism', but said his rhetoric did not convey the pro-American sentiment he had heard from Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Giuliani later tried to dig himself out of claims that his views were rooted in racism - by claiming Obama's upbringing was essentially 'white', because of his schools and white mother. Democrats on Thursday urged the potential field of Republican presidential candidates to rebuke Giuliani's comments. Deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said it was ‘a horrible thing to say’, while Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said it was the time for Republican leaders to 'stop this nonsense.' But speaking to the New York Times, Giuliani stood by his remarks and claimed he was attacking the president's socialist principals. 'Some people thought it was racist -- I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother, a white grandfather, went to white schools, and most of this he learned from white people,' Giuliani said. 'This isn’t racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.' Speaking to the New York Times, Giuliani said his remarks weren't racist because the president had been raised by his white mother, pictured above . The questioning of Obama's patriotism brought to mind a familiar conservative criticism during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns that he hasn't been proud enough of the United States. During his presidency, a smaller segment falsely claimed that Obama was not born in the United States but rather in his father's native Kenya. Wednesday night's private dinner was attended by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is considering a 2016 campaign. Giuliani said that 'with all our flaws we're the most exceptional country in the world. I'm looking for a presidential candidate who can express that, do that and carry it out.' 'And if it's you Scott, I'll endorse you,' Giuliani said, addressing Walker. 'And if it's somebody else, I'll support somebody else.' Walker, asked about the comments in an interview with CNBC, did not directly address whether he agreed with the former mayor. Wednesday night's private dinner was a fundraiser for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker who refused to condemn Giuliani . 'The mayor can speak for himself. I'm not going to comment on whether — what the president thinks or not. He can speak for himself as well,' Walker said. 'I'll tell you, I love America, and I think there are plenty of people, Democrat, Republican, independent, everywhere in between, who love this country.' Asked about Obama in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Giuliani said he wasn't 'questioning his patriotism. He's a patriot, I'm sure. 'What I'm saying is, in his rhetoric, I very rarely hear him say the things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to hear Bill Clinton say, about how much he loves America.' A spokesman for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul declined comment and a spokeswoman for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had no immediate response. Both are potential Republican presidential candidates. Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, said she often disagreed with former President George W. Bush and Republicans in Congress but never questioned their patriotism. She noted that Arizona Sen. John McCain, during his 2008 presidential campaign, urged fellow Republicans not to question Obama's love of country. 'I would challenge my Republican colleagues and anyone in the Republican party to say, 'Enough.' They need to start leading,' Wasserman Schultz said.","Former NYC mayor has faced waves of outrage over his scathing comments .

"The young man and the sea... During a moment that would have made famed marlin hunter Ernest Hemingway jealous, a Brooklyn teenager hauled in the year's biggest blue marlin off the coast of Kona, Hawaii. The fish 16-year-old Kai Rizzuto caught weighs 1,058lbs and measures 11 feet from tip to tail. Rizzuto, the grandson of sport fishing writer Jim Rizzuto, snagged the rare 'grander' blue marlin earlier this week and the moment was captured on video. Scroll down for video . Kai Rizzuto (left of fish) poses with the rare 'grander' blue marlin he caught off the coast of Kona, Hawaii . Rizzuto got the 1,058lb, 11-foot fish aboard his 45-foot boat after a struggle that lasted for half an hour . Vimeo.com . When the five people on the boat finally got it aboard, the fish barely fit and its tail was hanging off the end . The teen was finally able to get the marlin aboard the 45-foot Monterey fishing boat he was on after a struggle that lasted for about a half an hour, HawaiiNewsNow reported. The so-called grander, which get its name because it weighs more than 1,000lbs, died during the fight. Rizzuto said: 'I'll tell you it was the hardest 30 minutes I've ever fought a fish. 'When I saw that fish at the end of line I was just thinking, don't break off. Do not break off.' When the fish was finally hauled in, it barely fit on the boat. It took all five people aboard the boat to secure the fish for measurements. The boat's captain, McGrew Rice, called the catch, 'the fish of a lifetime', according to NBC News. 'That's like hitting a grand slam home run in the last inning of the World Series.' It was the third grander Rice and his crew have ever brought aboard the boat.

He added: 'Marlin meat is very nutritious and is used in a lot of dishes, from poke and sashimi to sausages, jerky, tacos, fish cake and other delicacies. 'This fish was shared widely and there are probably more than 100 people enjoying it now.” The largest marlin on record weighed 1,560lbs and was caught in 1953 off the coast of Peru.

"Labour MP Sarah Champion, who represents the South Yorkshire town, said she now thinks the figures in the Jay Report may be an underestimate . Sex gangs are continuing to prey on vulnerable young girls in Rotherham despite last year's damning revelations of systemic and sustained abuse of more than 1,400 girls, the town's MP has claimed. Sarah Champion, the town's Labour MP since 2012, has revealed recent publicity had prompted many women to come forward to speak to her about how they had been abused, with around 10 percent of them describing new incidents. It comes just weeks after a criminal investigation was launched into a damning new report that found Rotherham Council was 'not fit for purpose' and still 'in denial' about the 1,400 young girls who were abused in the town over 16 years. Investigators concluded girls as young as 11 were left to be abused by mainly Asian men between 1997 and 2013 because the council's staff and politicians feared being labelled racist. Ms Champion told The Times: 'It is still going on, absolutely. 'It's usually young women who've read about this and recognised that this is what happened to them, but it's also young girls who are still involved. 'They're scared, they don't know what to do and they're asking for advice.' The MP has been vocal in her condemnation of South Yorkshire Police and the Rotherham Council's past conduct. This, she told the paper, had led to her becoming a target of intimidation within her own party, and she claimed there were people trying to bully and undermine her, as well as campaign against her. The abuse scandal in Rotherham is considered one of the worst in Britain's history with experts estimating that 1,400 girls fell into the clutches of paedophiles. The damning report, released earlier this month, was written by Louise Casey, director-general for troubled families at the government's Communities Department. She found the council had a 'deep-rooted' culture of sexism and bullying where it would 'shoot the messenger' and sought to force whistleblowers into silence or pay them off. Inspectors also found the council 'goes to some lengths to cover up information' and said that children in the town were still at risk of abuse. A council researcher claimed files detailing failures in tackling abuse in the town were stolen from her office and never recovered. A report by Professor Alexis Jay last August revealed how some 1,400 vulnerable girls had been subjected to rape, violence and trafficking by gangs of mainly Asian men in Rotherham (pictured) between 1997 and 2013 . In October 2014 a Home Affairs Select Committee report called for an urgent investigation into the allegation. The committee added that the council and South Yorkshire Police ignored 'compelling evidence' about the scale of the abuse. The report said South Yorkshire Police also failed in its role to protect victims, turning a blind eye to their plight and in many cases holding them responsible. Police were said to be aware that a victim was 'raped with a broken bottle' and some girls were 'ordered to kiss perpetrators' feet at gun point' but never took any action. In one case an officer told a victim: 'Don't worry- you aren't the first girl to be raped by XX and you won't be the last'. Rotherham Borough Council (pictured) faces new elections and new management after the damning report . The shocking report, released on February 5, found that Rotherham councillors demonstrated a 'resolute denial' of what has happened - even after the damning Jay Report revealed the extent of the sex abuse scandal. Louise Casey said her inspection team found 'a council in denial about serious and on-going safeguarding failures' as well as a 'culture of covering up uncomfortable truths'. She also claimed the council attempted to 'silence whistleblowers and pay off staff' rather than 'dealing with difficult issues'. The report reads: 'RMBC goes to some length to cover up information and to silence whistleblowers. They (councillors) denied that there had been a problem, or if there had been, that it was as big as was said. 'If there was a problem they certainly were not told - it was someone else's job. They were no worse than anyone else. They had won awards. The media were out to get them.' The report described how there was an 'unhealthy climate' of 'shoot the messenger' where people 'feared to speak out because they had seen the consequences of doing so for others'. One whistleblower told the inspectors that no-one would 'dare' use the whistleblowing policy because it 'would come back to bite them in the backside and they would be bullied out of the organisation'. Another said they were 'proud' to have blown the whistle, despite it costing 'my job and my career'. They said: 'I stepped forward on behalf of young people … It cost me my job and my career. I feel it was worth it. I am proud to have done so despite the cost to my health and financial situation… the machine at RMBC doesn’t care, won’t listen and simply exists to cover up and destroy.' One concerned member of staff said threats had been made towards staff who did not toe the line, while another 'feared for reprisals' if they came forward with information. Inspectors found that, in two cases involving whistleblowers, officers considered the risk of potential harm to children as secondary to hitting targets or avoiding uncomfortable press coverage. The report also highlighted how staff and councillors were dubious about the findings of the Jay Report itself, with some saying they were 'bruised' by its publication. One councillor claimed the accusations were 'biased', 'exaggerated' and motivated by politics. She said: 'When inspectors commenced work in Rotherham, we were struck by the overwhelming denial of what Professor Jay set out in her report. She added: 'When asked, 70 per cent of the current Rotherham councillors we spoke to (including those in the Cabinet) disputed Professor Jay's findings.'","Girls are still being targeted in Rotherham despite abuse scandal revelation .

"A 72-year-old who was arrested for possessing an antique gun was pulled over during a drugs search in a car littered with used heroin bags, police have claimed. Gordon Van Gilder was stopped in Cumberland County, New Jersey, last November with a mid-1700s flintock pistol in the glove compartment. The former teacher was arrested and is now facing 10 years of prison, despite claiming the case is a waste of taxpayers' money. But revelations from the sheriff's department have revealed Van Gilder was 'acting suspiciously' in an area of high drug activity. Scroll down for video . Upset: Gordon van Gilder, pictured, had an antique gun from the 1700s in his car at the time of a traffic stop . Piece of history: The gun is reportedly 300 three years old and was made in the 1700s . According to the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department Van Gilder was in the passenger alongside Adam Puttergill, 21, and allegedly admitted he was in the area to buy drugs. Officers found drugs on him and charged him with possession of a dangerous substance. Officers also found empty heroin bags on the floor. But Van Gilder wasn't slapped with drug charges - only possession of an unlawful weapon. Cumberland County Sheriff Robert Austino told NJ.com: 'This is not just a case of the police picking on an elderly gun collector.' Van Gilder described the incident during an interview with NRA News. He claims he was stopped for what the news outlet called a 'minor traffic violation' and a sheriff's deputy asked to do a search. A deputy asked if there was anything dangerous in the car, he answered that the glove compartment contained the pistol. 'The reason I got the firearm was it goes with my collection of 18th-century objects,' he said. 'One of the undersheriffs said, ""Well, let him go, it's 250 years old."" But his boss, who is the sheriff, said, ""No, we have to arrest him."" 'Next morning, I am sleeping and I hear big pounding on the door, and four of them came and took me away with three or four sheriff's cars - I guess they didn't have anything better to do with taxpayers' money, by the way.' Evan Nappen, Van Gilder's attorney, said his client is facing up to ten years in state's prison with a minimum mandatory three-and-a-half to five years. He has no chance of parole, because New Jersey's modern handgun law includes antique handguns. Lawyer: Evan Nappen has said his client is 'facing the same draconian penalty as if he had a .44 Magnum loaded on his person' 'I'm charged as a felon,' Van Gilder, added. 'That could ruin my life. That could hurt my pension that I spent 34 years acquiring. I couldn't vote now, and it's not right, it's not fair.' 'Maybe technically I did violate New Jersey law, 'but as a very wise man said once upon a time, ""If that's the law, then the law is an a**.'' A fundraising website for Van Gilder's legal fees, which has already raised over $18,000 out of a $25,000 goal, says he is facing a felony second-degree criminal possession of a handgun charge. Nappen said in an emailed statement to Daily Mail Online Thursday that 'this is an example of New Jersey's extreme gun control.' Jennifer Webb-McRae, Cumberland County Prosecutor, declined to comment. Cumberland County Sheriff Robert Austino told Daily Mail Online: 'My answer is that one must ask what a person is doing with any type of gun in a glove box, in a known drug area and admittedly there for the sole purpose of buying drugs.' He continued, 'In fact used heroin packets were found in his vehicle along with drugs on the driver (who was arrested). In addition, state law clearly covers antique firearms and he was in violation. If people disagree, then they should act to change the law.' Nappen said in an emailed statement to Daily Mail Online 'Why? Obviously, flintlocks are the weapon of choice for drug dealers. My [72-year-old severely] arthritic client was given a ride to [retrieve] his 18th century antique. He is not on drugs, but the folks who made New Jersey's gun laws may well have been.'","Gordon Van Gilder, 72, was stopped in New Jersey in November .

"Dramatic images capture the moment that an 80-year-old woman was freed from the rubble of her home after it was reportedly destroyed in an air strike on Syria's largest city. The woman is believed to have been trapped for several hours before she was rescued by volunteers combing the streets of Aleppo following the reported raid by government forces. Photographs show her curled up in a small alcove beneath a section of the collapsed building - her arm shielding her head from falling rock - before she is carried to safety on a stretcher. The extent of her injuries is not known. Scroll down for video . Trapped: The 80-year-old woman was rescued from the rubble where her home once stood in Aleppo, Syria . Destroyed: Volunteers work to free the woman, who is believed to have been stuck for several hours . Rescue: She is carried through the streets of the war-torn city, where fighting has intensified this week . Fighting near and inside the war-torn city has intensified this week as the army tries to seize territory north of the city in its ongoing battle against the Al-Qaeda-affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra. At least 48 fighters and family members were killed during last week's offensive against opposition-held areas in Aleppo, according to UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. However, Assad's military denied the killings and claimed it was the work of rebel forces. 'I deny completely such an act that cannot be committed by the Syrian army whose duty is to protect lives and not kill people,' a military source told Reuters. He said armed groups kill residents whom they suspect of being loyal or working with the government and accuse the army of committing the acts. The victims were shot in their homes in the village of Raitan on Tuesday shortly after the village fell to the army and loyalist forces including Iranian fighters, the monitoring group reported. Five women and 10 children were among those killed, it added.Rami Abdul Rahman of the group, said his group confirmed the killings in the village from locals. The affiliation of those killed was not immediately clear. Destroyed: Drone footage shot by Al Jazeera reveals how the one prosperous city now lies in ruins . Bombed: Entire streets full of shops, public baths and residential properties are caked in dust from aerial shelling . Ceasefire: UN's special envoy to Syria will travel to the countryto try and negotiate a six-week suspension of government shelling and artillery strikes on the embattled Aleppo . Earlier today, drone footage emerged that has reveals the utter destruction inside the city - besieged by violent battles between government and rebel forces for more than three years. The video shot by AJ+ shows how bath houses, shops and residential buildings in the once-thriving world heritage site now lie in complete ruin. The city has been carved in two since 2012, when opposition fighters launched an offensive to take control of the eastern half, while the government retained the west. Whole neighborhoods are in rubble and opposition fighters now face a two-front war against the government and the Islamic State group. The overall conflict in Syria has killed at least 220,000 people and sent more than 3.8 million people fleeing the country. The fighting reportedly started when government forces launched a sudden offensive to recapture three extremist-held towns in Aleppo that can potentially cut off rebel routes deep into the city. UN's special envoy to Syria will travel to the country this month to try and negotiate a six-week suspension of government shelling and artillery strikes on the embattled Aleppo. It is unknown - and unlikely - that opposition forces will agree to the ceasefire proposed by Staffan de Mistura who says the government is open to the idea of a freeze in fighting. He said Damascus was willing to suspend aerial bombardment to test the possibility of a ceasefire in the city, where both Jihadists and other insurgents are battling the army and allied forces. Intense: Fighting near and inside Aleppo has accelerated this week as the army tries to recapture  territory north of the city from Al-Qaeda-affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra. Armed: Rebels have taken to making their own ammunition - the latest of these weapons are gas cylinder howitzers, aptly nicknamed Hell Cannons . Howitzer: The rebel groups are said to take great pride in the cannon, which they developed themselves and has a range of about a mile . Battle: The fighting reportedly intensified when government forces launched a sudden offensive to recapture three extremist-held towns in Aleppo (pictured) Death: At least 248 fighters - including 129 government soldiers and 119 rebels - have died in Aleppo since Tuesday according to UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . But on Thursday, the regime said the success of a recent UN plan to freeze fighting in the city hinges on foreign states withdrawing their support for so-called insurgents. Interior Minister Omran al-Zoabi claims the Syrian army has had more success against Islamic State and other militant groups than 'anything accomplished by a US-led alliance'. It emerged this week that Syrian rebels are firing propane gas cylinders from howitzers as deadly battles with government forces continue. With little access to weapons other than small arms such as machine guns, they have taken to making their own ammunition. The latest of these weapons are gas cylinder howitzers, aptly nicknamed Hell Cannons, which on Wednesday were fired towards forces loyal to president Bashar Al-Assad in Aleppo. Almost four years into the conflict, the Syrian government is still fighting insurgents in the southern and northern regions of the country, in addition to ISIS which has declared its central city of Raqqa as its capital. The United States and other allied nations have been carrying airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria since September. But government officials have previously described their efforts as 'fruitless'.","Woman was freed by volunteers after being trapped for several hours .

"Beloved ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's newest flavor is as fantastically 'over the top' as the funny man who inspired it. To celebrate Jimmy Fallon's first full season as the host of The Tonight Show, the brand has debuted The Tonight Dough, a decadent ice cream that 'combines chocolate and caramel ice creams with chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough and a crunchy chocolate cookie swirl'. In order to see if the bold new flavor really was 'chock full of the stuff people love', the Femail team put Ben & Jerry's newest ice cream to the test at our New York City headquarters. Scroll down for video . Over the top: The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy Fallon 'combines chocolate and caramel ice creams with chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough and a crunchy chocolate cookie swirl' Big reveal: Ben & Jerry's co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield joined Jimmy on his show earlier this week to help debut their new flavor, which celebrates the comedian's first full season of The Tonight Show . 'Quite sickly, but really tasty,' said US Femail assistant editor Charlie Lankston. 'I liked that I could taste a different variety of flavors, from chocolate to peanut butter. She added: 'But I felt that it could have done with a few more cookie dough pieces.' Daily Mail Online's Senior Associate Photo Editor Kaitlinn Van Ert agreed that the the two varieties of cookie dough bites made the ice cream even more appealing. 'The mix in textures is really nice and it’s a good balance in flavors,' she said. '[You] can never go wrong with cookie dough.' US Assistant Science and Technology Editor Ellie Zolfagharifard rated the flavor seven out of ten because she thought it was lacking when it came to another of its ingredients. Number one fan: 'This ice cream is the greatest,' Jimmy told his audience as he enjoyed a sample with the company's founders . 'I think it needs more chocolate,' she explained. 'But otherwise very tasty.' Jimmy unveiled the new flavor on his show earlier this week, explaining that when he was hosting Late Night With Jimmy Fallon in 2011, Ben & Jerry's had created its first flavor in his honor - Late Night Snack. Sadly the vanilla bean ice cream, which contained salty caramel swirls and fudge covered potato chip clusters, has since been discontinued, but Jimmy noted that he was ready for a bigger and better flavor anyway. 'This isn't Late Night anymore. This is the Tonight Show,' he said. 'This is the big leagues. We have to raise the bar. We have to up our game, and that is exactly what we did.' Charity work: Jimmy also revealed that all the proceeds from Tonight Dough will go to SeriousFun Children’s Network, a non-profit organization that funds camps and programs for children with serious illnesses . Fun game: After debuting the new flavor, Jimmy hid inside an ice cream feeding machine at the Ben & Jerry's shop at New York City's Rockefeller Center in order to trick customers who were sampling The Tonight Dough . Although Jimmy said they 'tried thousands' of flavor combinations', he never specifically explained how they landed on the ice cream's key ingredients. Ben & Jerry's co-founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield joined Jimmy on his show to help debut their new ice cream, and after a dramatic drum roll, the late night host excitedly uncovered a giant tub of The Tonight Dough. 'Guys, this ice cream is the greatest. It is the best tasting ice cream - I swear - you will ever have in your life.' Jimmy also revealed that all the proceeds from Tonight Dough will go to SeriousFun Children’s Network, a non-profit organization that funds camps and programs for children with serious illnesses. But the host didn't stop there. The next day he visited the Ben & Jerry's shop at New York City's Rockefeller Center, where he hid inside a 'state-of-the-art ice cream feeding machine' to hand out samples of The Tonight Dough and play a few trick on his fans. Great Surprise: Fans were thrilled to learn that the bizarre ice cream feeding machine was actually being run by the Tonight Show host .","The Tonight Dough is chocolate and caramel ice creams combined with chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough and a crunchy chocolate cookie swirl ."
"A man admitted to trying to sell a house near Hyde Park for £1million from under its owner's nose. Benjamin Khoury, 26, attempted to sell the property on Clarendon Mews, in Bayswater, west London in November last year despite having no legal right to the home.

"Kelly Brook’s arrival in Hollywood three months ago was a decidedly low-key affair. Instead of embracing her pin-up image, she let it be known that she was ‘reinventing’ herself as a serious actress. In true Tinseltown style, she swiftly airbrushed her disastrous British television career from her biography, during which she was dumped as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent after just one appearance and axed from The Big Breakfast amid accusations that she couldn’t read the Autocue. And in an effort to be seen as more than a lingerie model famous for flaunting her body, she posted a series of snaps on Instagram of herself cycling in the California sunshine and sparring in a gym. But now it seems she has already ditched her attempts to be ‘taken seriously’ after landing a major role in a new prime-time US comedy TV series – a move she describes as ‘the biggest opportunity of my life’. Scroll down for video . Next big thing: Kelly Brook has landed a major role in new prime-time US comedy TV series One Big Happy . The British beauty, far right, with One Big Happy co=stars Nick Zano and Elisha Cuthbert . To publicise the NBC show, called One Big Happy, a trailer stars a naked Kelly (tastefully pixelated) playing a studio audience for laughs with jokes about her ‘big boobs’. In the racy clip, she says playfully: ‘How would I do on the lesbian market? I don’t think I’ve ever been appraised.’ The role is tipped to promote her into the A-list, with TV producers touting her to the American press as ‘Britain’s Sofia Vergara’ – a reference to the bombshell Colombian actress and star of the hit show Modern Family. Sofia has become the highest-earning actress on US TV, raking in an estimated £22 million a year. And Kelly, 35, is only too happy to comply. ‘Sofia is someone I look up to,’ she says. ‘She has a fantastic, fun accent and she’s a sexy woman but does comedy so well. If I could try to be a little like that, that would be great. ‘I’d love a bit of her success. I’ve always been the brunt of the joke. I’ve always been the stooge.’ HER new role is certainly lucrative, with some reports claiming that she has earned £550,000 for six episodes. In several shots she is seen topless (suitably pixelated). Group hug: Kelly, third from the left, with stars and executives from the sitcom, including chat-show host and series producer Ellen DeGeneres, in cream jacket . ‘Kelly is back doing what she does best,’ said a friend last night. ‘It was a very conscious decision. She knows it’s something of a cliche for her to be the glamour girl showing off her breasts, but she is convinced that, at 35, this is her last big chance to break into Hollywood. ‘Despite all her past talk of reinvention, of becoming a serious actress or presenter, she knows it was her body that caught the eye of the show’s producers. She finally gets it that it is her body that will bring her to the attention of the public in America. ‘She accepts she has always been a bit of a figure of fun in England. But what people don’t realise is that there’s a ruthless streak in Kelly. She’s tough and she’s a survivor. Kelly arrived in Hollywood three months ago to reinvent herself as a serious actress . ‘The very fact she’s made it on to a prime-time comedy show in the US is something to be applauded when you think about how many girls arrive in Hollywood each year trying to get work.’ And as proof that Kelly is determined to ensure her pin-up statistics get the maximum coverage, she has posted a slow-motion video of herself on social media in a tiny pink and orange bikini emerging sexily from an LA swimming pool. Informing her fans last week that she has shed 7lb on the Atkins diet, she shows off her leaner shape in a series of provocative poses. Kelly’s new show, which premieres in the US next month, is the brainchild of talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, who has become something of a mentor to Kelly. One Big Happy stars up-and-coming Canadian actress Elisha Cuthbert (who played Kim Bauer in 24), and Nick Zano, star of Melrose Place. Elisha’s character Lizzy is a lesbian who decides she wants to have a baby with her straight childhood friend Luke (Zano). But things become complicated when Luke meets Prudence (Kelly), a ‘free-spirited British girl’, in a bar and falls instantly in love. When Lizzy finally finds out she is pregnant, Luke announces that he and Prudence are married – creating one very different ‘family’. Kelly’s performance has been a big hit with the show’s writer and executive producer, Liz Feldman. She says: ‘Our US casting director, Julie Ashton, found Kelly after a long and exhaustive search. She remembered her from her days on the TV series Smallville [in 2001] and sought her out in England. ‘We had seen hundreds of women for the part of Prudence. People were auditioning on three continents. We saw some lovely, talented actresses but no one quite had the right balance between beautiful and funny until Kelly came along.’ Kelly, pictured hosting Channel 4's Big Breakfast with Johnny Vaughan, has airbrushed her disastrous UK television career from her biography . She adds: ‘Kelly’s tape was sent to me on a Saturday night and I immediately knew she was a star, though I wasn’t at all familiar with her. She flew to LA two days later to do her screen test, blew us all away, and the role was hers by Friday. ‘We were having a hard time finding a bombshell beauty who could really do comedy. I was so relieved when she came in to do her screen test because she made me laugh. ‘It’s obvious to everyone that she’s gorgeous but it’s certainly unexpected that she can really land a joke. It’s extremely rare to find someone that gorgeous and that hilarious. ‘She’s already a star – America just doesn’t know it yet. But they will, because she really does shine on the screen. She’s so likeable and has such great energy and timing, I think audiences are going to be very taken with her. Kelly, pictured left, is being touted to the American press as the Britain's Sofia Vergara. The Colombian bombshell, pictured right, is the highest earning actress on US TV . ‘I really hope One Big Happy airs in the UK. The character of Prudence comes from that love and enchantment I have with England. So it would be a dream for it to be shown there. And I would love for everyone in the UK to see just how fantastic Kelly is on the show. I think people will fall in love with her in a new way.’ The actress herself, well-known for her high-profile romances with Hollywood stars Jason Statham and Billy Zane, says the role has transformed her life. ‘I was living in a little cottage in the English countryside when I read the script. I had a lovely life in England. I own a restaurant, I’m very busy. It took a lot for me to leave my family and my life and come here, but when I read the script I don’t think I’d reacted to anything so profoundly in a long time. It was just a case of “I need to get on a plane and try to get that job”.’ ‘Initially, I put myself on tape and sent it to Ellen and the producers and they said “Yes, fly out” and I was on a plane the next day, and it’s been a rollercoaster since then. Kelly has previously had high profile romances Hollywood stars Billy Zane and Jason Statham . ‘I think they saw about 400 girls and I came in at the 11th hour. ‘When I flew in, they had a few girls lined up and the girl who came before me said, “You have to kiss in the audition!” And I thought, “Oh well, I just have to go for it.” ‘There are not that many roles for British girls who look like me or sound like me on American television. I’m not going to get a role on Downton Abbey, let’s be honest. ‘So I just went in there and it clicked and that was that.’","Arrived in Hollywood three months ago to 'reinvent' herself as actress .

"Jacob Ramsey, a five-year veteran with the Kansas City Police Department, has been indicted for shooting and wounding Anthony Contreras, 37, (pictured) in Kansas City, Missouri, last summer . A Missouri police officer was arraigned Friday after a grand jury indicted him in the shooting of a man who was wounded during an arrest last summer. Jacob Ramsey, a five-year veteran with the Kansas City Police Department, faces charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. A Jackson County judge entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Investigators say Ramsey shot 37-year-old Anthony Contreras on June 24 after police went to Contreras' home to serve an arrest warrant. KCTV reported the warrant stemmed from Contreras' failure to appear in court on earlier charges of burglary, tampering with a motor vehicle and resisting arrest. Police said Contreras was shot while trying to run away. His family and friends insisted at the time that he was unarmed. Authorities have not commented on whether Contreras was found to have a weapon. Ramsey waived his right to a jury trial through his attorney Friday and requested that a judge decide the case. A trial has been scheduled for April 2. Ramsey, 31, is on unpaid administrative leave, police Capt. Tye Grant said in a statement. Grant declined to comment further and referred questions to the Jackson County prosecutor. Kansas City's Fraternal Order of Police lodge called Friday's indictment 'baseless,' saying in a statement that Ramsey 'justifiably defended himself against a felon previously convicted of resisting arrest, narcotics and illegal possession of a firearm.' Ramsey also acted in compliance with state and federal law, as well as his department's policies, the FOP said. 'The FOP and its members stand firmly behind Officer Ramsey, who has a flawless record and is an impeccable police officer,' the organization said. 'The FOP will devote all of its substantial resources to the defense of Officer Ramsey, and will stand by him throughout this process, which will ultimately lead to his acquittal.' Investigators say Ramsey, a veteran with the department, arrived at Contreras' home (pictured) to serve an arrest warrant for resisting arrest. He was shot while running away .

"Criminal past: Sperm donor Declan Rooney as he emerged smirking from court in 1993 . The Mail on Sunday can today unmask an anonymous sperm donor who boasts that an astonishing 32 women are expecting his babies and another 15 are about to take pregnancy tests after asking him for donations. Declan Rooney, 42, claims he is ‘Britain’s most successful sperm donor’ and says he has donated sperm to two more women who have already given birth. He also has six children born naturally with three different mothers – meaning he has the potential to be the father of 55 children. The former web designer runs his website under the alias Upton North and advertises himself on Facebook to single women, lesbians and couples desperate for a baby. Last night experts called for an investigation into the unregulated and potentially dangerous service he provides to women he meets online, with one sociologist saying that Mr Rooney was ‘determinedly engineering a one-man eugenics movement’. Medical experts fear he could create a ‘ticking timebomb’ by flouting official guidelines for sperm donation, which limit the number of families that legitimate sperm donors can help create to a maximum of ten. As well as growing up without knowing their father, his children will potentially live close to each other, meaning that half-brothers and sisters may meet and unwittingly have children of their own. The murky world of unregulated sperm donation has come under increasing scrutiny from watchdogs as the internet offers men and women easy opportunities to meet up anonymously and create families – without needing to qualify or pay for expensive private fertility treatment, overseen by doctors. A cycle of artificial insemination costs £850 privately and is only offered to selected patients on the NHS. Rooney set up his anonymous site last March, offering to visit women in their homes or hotel within a 50-mile radius of his Middlesbrough home and give them a sample of his sperm in a specimen pot for them to inseminate themselves. His website, which was taken down last night after he was contacted by The Mail on Sunday, stated: ‘I am willing to help either through artificial insemination or naturally with no strings attached.’ Despite that wording, he told this newspaper that he does not have sex with the women. Sperm donations are not illegal unless a man charges for the service, but the risks of private donations include reports of women being abused, pressured into sex or forced to hand over money when they meet a donor. Rooney, who insists he acts within the law, says he only charges ‘expenses’ and that his motives are purely ‘altruistic’. He said: ‘I like helping people’. And he added: ‘Have you changed anyone’s lives for the better?’ His cynical advert: Declan Rooney boasted of 'natural' insemination, but insisted he did not offer sex . Since becoming a sperm donor, Rooney says two lesbian women in the North East have given birth to his children. He said: ‘When I was told, I was really happy for the mothers. I like meeting new people, I like hearing their stories, I like problem-solving. I’m quite an altruistic person. I haven’t done anything illegal. ‘I set myself up as a private donor and have been inundated – I have 5,000 emails. If they are too far out of the area I say no to them. If you say you’re a sperm donor, people say it’s really smutty, but if someone said they were an egg donor it’s like “Wow that’s amazing”. There were a few days when I had a success each day. It’s a good feeling.’ On Rooney’s webpage he backed up his claims by posting photos of ultrasounds scans, positive reviews from female recipients and an image of a specimen pot. A HUMAN Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, women finding a sperm donor online, rather than through a licensed clinic, run a number of risks. Apart from the personal safety risks to the woman, the donor won’t have been screened for infectious diseases like HIV, or for inherited illnesses, and he will probably also be the legal parent of any child that is born.' Dr Suvir Venkataraman of London’s Harley Street Fertility Clinic, added: ‘A registered clinic will inform a child of a donor who else has been born using their sperm so they don’t have a sexual relationship with someone sharing the same genes. This man cannot expect to keep tabs on everyone and that is a big risk.’ Mr Rooney, who says his partner ‘understands my reasons for donating’, claims that his family have had no medical issues in five generations. ‘I wouldn’t donate if I had something genetically wrong. And there is no risk that my offspring will unknowingly have sex with each other because evolution makes sure that we are not attracted to people with the same genes,’ he claimed. He also boasted that he is ‘immune’ from the Child Support Agency. ‘The CSA has to find your taxable income and assets. They would have difficulty. I’m not scared of them,’ he said. Mr Rooney was photographed on the front page of the Daily Mail in 1993 leaving court smirking after he was found guilty of causing £60,000 of graffiti damage. He was given a suspended sentence and served seven months in a young offenders’ institution while waiting to stand trial. As he stepped out of the dock he said: ‘My barrister’s a genius. I’m laughing. It’s a soft touch.’ Questioned on his criminal past last night, he said: ‘I don’t mention it to recipients, but if the subject comes up then I will talk about it.’ Sociologist Claire McQuoid has researched private sperm donation and is setting up a charity for women who have been abused by donors. She said: ‘When Upton North appeared on the scene he developed a reputation for someone determined to impregnate as many women as possible, with no concern for child welfare, or indeed the women themselves. His aggressive online marketing is akin to a eugenics mission where he competes with other donors.’","Sperm donor Declan Rooney boasts 32 women are expecting his babies .

"Robbie Williams incurred the wrath of Led Zeppelin rocker Jimmy Page over plans to revamp his mansion - and now he's upset M&S heir Mr Sieff . He is used to the adoration of pop fans – but when it comes to neighbours, Robbie Williams is having the opposite effect. The Angels singer has already incurred the wrath of Led Zeppelin rocker Jimmy Page over plans to revamp his £17.5 million London mansion. And now the former Take That star has upset Marks & Spencer heir Jonathan Sieff. Mr Sieff has written to Kensington and Chelsea Council to complain about Williams’s request to install air conditioning units at the bottom of his garden, which backs onto Mr Sieff’s property. The great-great grandson of Mr Marks is worried the machines’ noise will detract from his quality of life. He wrote that the three units together will produce a constant sound of 43.5dB, ‘which is nearly the same comparison as an adult speaking’. He added: ‘My garden is only 90 sqm and from the location of the units to my kitchen doors is 9.5 metres so why should I have someone else’s noise affecting my surrounding property, where the applicant in question can put the condenser units anywhere the applicant wishes on his property as it is vastly bigger. ‘If the resident would like to install the condenser units, I would grant the applicant permission to install them but nowhere near my property so it doesn’t affect my family from going outside, enjoying the garden from some tranquillity and freedom from disturbance.’ He is also worried about the disturbance that might be caused to local residents if the proposed works on the nineteenth century property are given the green light. Mr Williams, 41, bought the 46-room mansion in the Holland Park area from the late film director Michael Winner in 2013. He lives in the property, called Woodland House, with his wife Ayda Field, 35, and their two children. He first submitted plans to modernise the home in early December last year, claiming he wanted to create a ‘contemporary standard of family living.’ Mr Williams, 41, bought the 46-room mansion in the Holland Park area from the late film director Michael Winner in 2013.

However, Mr Page,who has lived in the neighbouring Tower House for four decades, quickly submitting an objection to the assorted proposals, which included building a recording studio, partly filling a swimming pool and adding a window overlooking his garden. In a letter to the council, the veteran rocker wrote that he was ‘extremely concerned’ the works would create an eyesore and might even damage his own Grade I listed property. He added: ‘I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the wellbeing of this important heritage asset.’ However, rather than backing down, Williams upped the ante by submitting another tranche of planning requests, which would see him build a 3,600sq/ft basement – complete with swimming pool – under his back garden and a ‘like for like’ replacement of a first floor balcony.","Singer Robbie Williams, 41, upset neighbours over plans to revamp home .

"Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud is to host the first television appeal ever made by the charity set up in the memory of Stephen Lawrence. He will hail the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust for helping young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to ‘smash through barriers’ in pursuit of their dream careers. The trust, founded by the murdered teenager’s mother in 1998, already has a proven track record of helping students into architecture, the profession which Stephen had wanted to enter since the age of seven. Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud, pictured right, is to present the first television appeal ever made by a charity set up in memory of Stephen Lawrence, pictured left . It has awarded over 100 architecture bursaries and so far many students have gone on to qualify as architects while the others have succeeded in associated areas. With a staff of just six and entirely funded by donations, the Trust has already reached more than 1,500 people attending workshops at the iconic Stephen Lawrence Centre, providing events, courses and programmes to help them to aim high and overcome barriers to employment- and encourages young people to strive to become lawyers and journalists too. Mr McCloud, who has presented the unusual homebuilding show Grand Designs on Channel Four since 1999, said: ‘What I find extraordinary about the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is that they allow people to realise their dream and to smash through barriers.’ He will present the Lifeline Appeal, a monthly slot on the BBC in which a well-known personality introduces the vital work of a charity they care about and appeals for donations, on Sunday (Feb 22) at 4.45pm on BBC1. It will be repeated on BBC2 on February 25 at 1pm on BBC2. The appeal features Eniola Asaolu who grew up in a tough area of North London and faced the choice of either joining a gang or becoming a victim of one until his fortunes changed when he won a place on a Stephen Lawrence Scholarship scheme at top City law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. It also tells how the trust helped Lisa Basu overcome the financial obstacles of an architect’s seven-year training. She couldn’t afford materials for her models while at university and was using pizza boxes, but thanks to a bursary from the trust was able to complete her studies. Mr McCloud said: ‘What I find extraordinary about the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is that they allow people to realise their dream and to smash through barriers.’ Baroness Lawrence said: ‘We are here as a catalyst so we can support them in whatever profession they want to go into.’ A-level student Stephen was stabbed to death aged 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993. He excelled at art and maths and got himself a placement at a big London architect firm before his murder. The Mail campaigned to bring the killers to justice and published a landmark front page accusing five men of the murder. Two were convicted in 2012. Last month, the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and the Mail announced two journalism scholarships.

"Two unfinished sketches by Paul Cezanne have been discovered on the reverse side of two watercolors after remaining unseen for almost one hundred years. Officials at Philadelphia's Barnes Foundation museum says the collector who bought the paintings more than 90 years ago probably never knew the hidden sketches were there. The foundation said the sketches — one graphite and the other watercolor — were found during conservation work on the reverse sides of two Cezanne watercolors depicting the landscape of southern France. Two Cezanne drawings were found on the backs of his watercolors undergoing restoration at the Barnes Foundation, including this graphite sketch of houses found on the back of his work Trees . Chief conservator Barbara Buckley (left) and consulting curator Martha Lucy (right) said that Dr Arthur Barnes did not know that he was buying the hidden drawings . Dr Barnes bough Trees (left) and The Chaine de l'Etoile Mountains (right) for $100 each in 1921 from Leo Stein . Officials said that the sketches haven't been seen since at least the early 20th century, 'most likely prior to Dr. Albert Barnes's purchase of the works from Leo Stein in 1921.' 'We've had (the watercolors) out of the frame before. But the backs were covered with brown paper,' said Barbara Buckley, the foundation's senior director of conservation and chief painting conservator, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 'That's one of the reasons they were sent (for conservation). Brown paper is very acidic, and they needed acid-free paper.' Officials said Cezanne often worked on both sides of the paper in his sketchbooks and on larger sheets, producing thousands of such drawings over the course of his career, but they were usually done 'to experiment with line and color.' Mr Barnes bought the watercolors for $100 each, according to the New York Times. The additional small experiments by the artist, who influenced many 20th century luminaries such as Pablo Picasso, may be worth a fortune. Cezanne's series The Card Players includes one of the most expensive paintings ever sold, a picture that the Qatari royal family bought for $263million. Paul Cezanne, (seen left in 1906, the year of his death and right in 1895 self-portrait) influenced much of 20th century art and his works regularly sell for millions of dollars . His watercolors have fetched up to $25million at auction, according to Art Daily. Ms Buckley said the sketches, which were on the back of watercolors normally on view in one of the galleries, offer a window into Cezanne's artistic process. On the back of 'The Chaine de l'Etoile Mountains,' conservators found that Cezanne had begun a sketch of trees with pencil and then color, but the center of the sketch is so unfinished it's hard to determine what it represents. Marks on the sketch include the word 'non', likely meaning that the work was not complete enough to be sold. On the back of 'Trees,' conservators found a detailed depiction without color of houses and the same Etoile range that was often the subject of the artist's sketches and paintings. 'We had no reason to think there was anything there,' said Ms Buckley, who said nothing was found on the back of another Cezanne watercolor after conservation work in 2007. Barnes officials say 15 unknown Cezanne drawings have been found in the last three decades. The Barnes Foundation, seen in its old building in 2003, also owns one of Cezanne's Card Players series, one of which sold for $263million to the Qatari royal family . Martha Lucy, a Drexel University assistant professor of art and art history and a former Barnes curator, said Cezanne frequently walked along a route that looked out over the Etoile mountains. The range ran near his home in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. 'Cezanne walked frequently there and did many depictions of it,' Lucy said. Both Ms Lucy and Ms Buckley said they believe that Albert Barnes was unaware that he had acquired, in Ms Lucy's words, 'four for the price of two.' The correspondence between Mr Barnes and Mr Stein, the brother of Gertrude Stein, contains no mention of the drawings, so the seller likely did not know about them either. The foundation plans to display the works in double-sided frames that will allow viewing of both sides from April 10 through May 18, after which the watercolors will be returned to their original locations. The Barnes Foundation was undergoing a multiyear restoration project for its work when the new sketches were discovered .","Philadelphia's Barnes Foundation finds graphite sketch and a watercolor .

"'Bank robber': Englishman Mark Rothwell, 49, has been charged with robbing a bank - despite having won a medal for foiling a similar hold-up in 2010 . A man who was hailed as a community hero after thwarting a bank robbery by tackling the would-be thief to the ground has allegedly committed a hold-up of his own. Mark Rothwell, a 49-year-old Englishman, is accused of barging into a community bank in Portland, Oregon, with a 9mm handgun drawn. Police say he shouted at the tellers to hand over everything they had, then made off in a pickup truck with a bag stuffed with notes totaling $15,703. Officers tracked down his white Toyota Tacoma and found the cash stashed inside, along with the gun, according to an arrest affidavit. Sniffer dogs then led police Rothwell, who apparently confessed to the robbery on the spot. He reportedly told officers: 'It's me you want... I just robbed the bank'. It is a dramatic reversal for Rothwell, who was awarded a Civilian Medal for Heroism in 2010 for tackling a man to the ground as he tried to rob a Chase Bank. He knocked a gun - later revealed to be fake - out of the man's hand, then pinned him to the ground while officers arrived. However, Rothwell allegedly surpassed that would-be criminal by taking a real 9mm Baretta firearm into the Albina Community Bank and making off with the cash. Police are yet to suggest a motive for Rothwell, who was born in London but moved to the United States more than a decade ago and now runs a home renovation business. According to The Oregonian, bank employees as well as surveillance footage confirmed that Rothwell was the man involved in the robbery. Haul: Rothwell, a local businessman in Portland, Oregon, allegedly held up a bank in the city with a 9mm pistol and made off with $15,703 . Bank tellers were reportedly able to recognize him because he did not fully cover his face, and had a recognizably European accent. Giving an account of his earlier crime-fighting, in a 2010 interview Rothwell said he sprang into action after hearing the would-be robber threaten the teller, who reminded him of his daughter. He said: 'He [the suspect] knew her name, and for a second I thought it was some kind of weird joke.' 'It's just one of those things - someone points a gun at a girl just a couple of years older than my own daughter. It just rubbed me the wrong way.' Rothwell, a father of two, told the Oregonian at the time that he had been a policeman himself, and had served in the military. Hold-up: Rothwell allegedly took the haul of cash from the Albina Community Bank to the northeast of Portland . At the time of the first robbery, he said police at first mistook him for the suspect. He also hinted at a criminal past of his own, saying of his award: 'Let's just say it's nice to be on the right side of the law this time.' On Friday his public defender lawyer, Ruben Iniguez, declined to comment. Rothwell is due to be arraigned on March 12.","Mark Rothwell, 49, accused of handgun hold-up in Portland, Oregon .

"Almost 1,000 jobhunters have applied to work at the most southerly post office in the world. The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust said it had received so many applicants its website crashed three times. Port Lockroy stands on a grizzled outcrop named Goudier Island, which is the size of a primary school playing field. There is no running water and the average temperature is –10C (14F). Chilly: Applications opened yesterday to run the world’s most remote post office - on Goudier Island in the Antarctic, where average temperatures are in the region of -10C . Those who applied were told they must have the ability to put up with 2,000 ‘smelly’ penguins for company. Applicants included ex-servicemen, scientists and students. The staff will spend from November until March running the shop, post office and museum operation at Port Lockroy, which is visited by 18,000 cruise ship passengers each season. Candidates are required to be able to ‘carry a big heavy box over slippery rocks and slushy snow whilst dodging penguins’, go without a shower and survive with no heating or running water. The location is so remote that even helicopters are unable to get there, which means the nearest doctor is three days away on a ship. Port Lockroy is visited between by approximately 18,000 ship-borne visitors amounting to two ship visits per day. The base is also home to the only gift shop in the continent . There is also no internet or Wi-Fi connection, no central heating, no phone signal, and no means of communication with the world other than by VHF radio. The advert by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT), says it is looking for people with ‘adaptability to different situations’. It adds: ‘Are you happy not to shower for up to a month, live in close proximity to three people and 2,000 smelly penguins for five months?’ ‘Can you enthuse to visitors when it is -5C and blowing a blizzard as well as cook supper cheerfully after a long cold day and very little sleep? ‘Living conditions are comfortable though basic with no mains power, heat or water, and limited communications.' Port Lockroy is visited during its summer by approximately 18,000 ship-borne visitors amounting to two ship visits per day. The base is also home to the only gift shop in the continent. Being the southernmost tip of the globe, there is no darkness, with daylight 24 hours a day. Advert: Candidates are required to be able to ‘carry a big heavy box over slippery rocks and slushy snow whilst dodging penguins’, go a month without a shower and survive with no heating or running water . Applications close on February 27 and the salary is £1,100 per calendar month. Expenses and subsistence are covered by the UKAHT.

"One baby is born through IVF to lesbian parents almost every day in the UK, new figures have revealed. The numbers from 2012 – the most recent available – show that 348 babies were born to women recorded as having a female partner. This is a 14-fold increase on the 25 such babies born in 2003, according to the statistics from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. One baby is born through IVF to lesbian parents almost every day in the UK, new figures have revealed (file picture) In total, over the ten-year period, IVF treatment clinics have helped bring 1,388 children into the world for lesbian couples. In addition, the HFEA said that over the same ten-year timespan 1,149 children were born through IVF to single women. However, the official numbers are considered an underestimate of the real total, as more children will have been conceived by single and lesbian mums with the help of donor insemination – much of which takes place outside regulated clinics. These latest figures from the HFEA reveal that almost 1,000 lesbian mums underwent IVF treatment in 2012 in a bid to become a mother. In 2003, just 77 women recorded as having a female partner underwent IVF treatment, resulting in 25 babies. By 2012, this number surged to 916 would-be lesbian mothers, who successfully gave birth to 348 babies. The number of lesbian couples having this type of fertility treatment has expanded rapidly in the last ten years, with much of it being funded by the NHS. Figures reveal that almost 1,000 lesbian mums underwent IVF treatment in 2012 in a bid to become a mother . The law was liberalised in 2008 to make it easier for two women to have children via IVF, by removing the obligation for clinics to consider the need for a father figure for the potential child. And in 2013, NHS rules were changed so that women in same-sex relationships with proven infertility could access state-funded fertility treatment. Before then, lesbian couples had to pay privately, at an estimated cost of around £15,000. A spokesman for the gay rights charity Stonewall said: ‘We think it’s fantastic that even more children are being conceived in safe and supportive environments, and into loving families, since the ban on lesbians using fertility clinics was lifted.’ But some campaigners have warned of the dangers of a generation of fatherless children. Dr Trevor Stammers, a trustee of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘The large recent increase in children born to mothers with a same sex partner at the time of the birth is concerning, in the light of a number of recent research studies which have shown – for example – a four-fold increase in emotional problems in children of same-sex parents, compared with children raised by both their biological parents.’","348 babies were born in 2012 to women recorded as having female partner .

"As the stars line up on the red carpet at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles later today, there will undoubtedly be a number who have resorted to a bizarre and controversial cosmetic ‘pick-me-up’ in a bid to look their best. The celebrity trend for injecting vitamins directly into the body has been endorsed by everyone from actress Jennifer Aniston and singer Katy Perry – who reportedly does it to perk up her bottom – to supermodel Cara Delevingne and pop star Rihanna, who are said to rely on the jabs as an antidote to their hard-partying lifestyles. Now, patients have another option. It’s called mesotherapy and involves having the infusions directly under the skin on the face, in an effort to reverse environmental damage from sun exposure, pollution and stress, and even cellulite. Before and after: Martine Lush opted for mesotherapy treatment shortly before her 40th birthday last summer and said she saw results almost immediately . Insiders claim Hollywood A-listers opt for this facial treatment over cosmetic surgery or other more aggressive treatments prior to ‘awards season’ as the results are subtle and there is little down time. And now UK clinics offer mesotherapy as a ‘natural’ alternative to anti-wrinkle injections of Botox and fillers, and which can also be ‘done in your lunch hour’. Some clinics are even offering huge discounts of more than 70 per cent on group purchase websites. But the trend comes with a warning. Dr Patrick Bowler, medical director of Courthouse Clinics and co-founder and fellow of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, says: ‘There is little clinical data to back up the often exaggerated claims. 'It sounds wonderful to inject all these essential elements into the skin, but think very carefully before you agree to go ahead.’ And the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery says it will not endorse mesotherapy until further research validates its effectiveness. Cheeky girl: Injections gave Katy Perry a 'derriere lift' In South America, companies are barred from claiming it can remedy the dimpled skin of cellulite, while in Australia there were reports the treatment resulted in a number of patients developing skin abscesses on their calves, buttocks, thighs, abdomen, shoulders, face or neck. The treatment takes its name from the mesoderm, the middle layer of the skin, which is penetrated during the procedure. This involves dozens of ‘micro-injections’ delivering a cocktail of Vitamins A, B, C and E, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, elastin and moisturising hyaluronic acid. This, say advocates, stimulates fibroblasts, the skin cells that produce collagen – a protein providing the firmness that becomes depleted with age. Full effects are apparent after two weeks with, typically, two to four treatments spaced two to three weeks apart needed. Sessions cost from £180. Nurse Benjamin Kauffholz, co-founder of Dr Maurice Dray’s clinic in London, where a facial version of mesotherapy, the Mesolift, was pioneered, says: ‘We recommend this from the age of 30 onwards, two or three times a year for the best effect. 'It’s like using the best anti-ageing cream for a year, but all in one go.’ One patient to have braved the needle is Martine Lush, who runs a bed-and-breakfast in Dorset. She opted for mesotherapy treatment shortly before her 40th birthday last summer. She had been reluctant to try other injections such as Botox, the jab that paralyses facial muscles, and so smooths out the lines and crevices that expressions such as frowning create. Calmer, Easier, Happier Boys: The Revolutionary Programme That Transforms Family Life by parenting expert Noel Janis-Norton (Yellow Kite) A parenting expert’s strategies for raising confident boys. £10.49, amazon.co.uk . She says: ‘The discomfort of mesotherapy is akin to having your legs waxed, but bearable. Afterwards, I was left with just a few tiny little cat-like scratches on my neck, which I could cover up with foundation. ‘I could see a difference in my skin immediately. I looked much fresher. My husband could see straight away too, and he was impressed. Over the next two weeks I saw the full effects develop. My skin was plumper and more dewy and the tone was better, much less blotchy. I like to get a tan on holiday and I am a smoker, so the treatment made a difference. My fine lines were reduced and I looked like a more youthful, glowier version of me.’ Martine also had Dr Dray’s ‘10-Minute Facelift’, involving injections of a gel containing chemicals called Biphasic Tricalcium Phosphates (BTCPs), costing £400. She says: ‘After turning 40, I left my job in advertising to run the B&B by the sea with my husband. My younger-looking face matches my new, less stressful lifestyle.’ Three ways to treat Varicose veins . Varicose veins can lead to complications such as blood clots, eczema and venus ulcers (file image) PREVENT: Varicose veins develop when the valves inside the veins stop working properly. If these valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein, leaving it swollen and enlarged. Not only are they unsightly, but they can lead to complications such as blood clots, eczema and venus ulcers. Professor Andrew Bradbury, professor of vascular surgery at the University of Birmingham, says: ‘Old age, being overweight and pregnancy can increase your chances of developing them, but it can be down to genetics.’ He adds: ‘Being on your feet a lot can exacerbate the condition – many of my patients are doctors, teachers and hairdressers – so try to transfer your weight from one foot to the other if you have to stand still for long periods. Compression stockings also help to improve circulation.’ TREAT: Prof Bradbury says your first port of call should be your GP, who should refer you to a specialist for an ultrasound to look at the extent of the problem. ‘The best way to get rid of varicose veins is non-surgical treatment to block off the affected vein so it dies,’ he adds. ‘This can be done with endothermal ablation, which uses radio waves or lasers to seal the veins, and foam sclerotherapy, where foam is injected into your veins to seal them. Only 15 per cent of people see the veins coming back eight years after treatment.’ DON’T BOTHER: Topical creams containing ingredients such as Vitamin E are marketed to ease swelling, but there is insufficient evidence to prove they are effective. Also avoid ‘stripping’ surgery, which involves tying off the vein and removing it. The procedure can cause bleeding, pain and nerve damage or deep-vein thrombosis in more serious cases. The operation: Keyhole surgery for Endometriosis . Endometriosis is a condition affecting 1.5 million UK women, where cells that behave like the ones in the lining of the womb grow elsewhere in the body. These cells react to the monthly menstrual cycle and also bleed, but there is no way for this blood to leave the body. This leads to pain, swelling and sometimes fertility problems if the fallopian tubes or ovaries are damaged. In laparoscopic, or keyhole surgery, small incisions are made in the stomach so the endometriosis tissue can be destroyed or cut out using a laser, heat or electric current. The surgeon says . Consultant gynaecologist Caroline Overton, a member of charity Endometriosis UK’s medical advisory panel, says: ‘The surgery is performed under general anaesthetic, but I aim to have patients home the same day. I’d book two weeks off work so you can concentrate on getting back to your best. ‘You will be tender because of the cuts in your stomach, so you can feel period-type pains or that you’ve done too many sit-ups. The rule of thumb is don’t try to lift anything heavier than a kettle or a bag of shopping for a few days. ‘Don’t spring out of bed in the morning. Instead roll on to your side, drop your feet on the floor and come up sideways. Baths are fine, but go for a quick dip rather than a long soak.

"It has been decades since a California socialite was buried in the front seat of her Ferrari in one of the country's most eccentric burials, but the grave remains a spectacle in Texas after nearly 40 years as thousands have visited the woman's grave. The burial of oil heiress and Beverly Hills socialite Sandra Ilene West drew 300 onlookers to San Antonio's Alamo Masonic Cemetery in May 1977, according to an original report in a 1977 edition of The Register-Guard. West was buried in the front seat of her light blue 1964 Ferrari 250GT - which would cost $2million if bought today - wearing a white nightgown 'with the seat slanted comfortably.' Sandra: Oil heiress and socialite Sandra West (photographed) was buried in the front seat of her Ferrari wearing a white nightgown in 1977, but her grave site still attracts tourists . Following the death of her Texas oil tycoon husband, Ike West, in 1968, West received his $5 million estate and promised it to her brother-in-law Sol West if he granted the burial request she had written in her will four years earlier, according toMy San Antonio. West died on March 10, 1977, according to an obituary. While some reports say West overdosed on prescription pills, others say she died due to complications of a car accident. West and her Italian sports car were flown to San Antonio to be buried next to her late husband in the historic cemetery which boasts the graves of those who helped shape San Antonio, according to My San Antonio. Ferrari: West's light blue Ferrari (with West inside) was placed in a crate and lowered into a grave measuring 19 feet long, 10 feet wide, and nine feet deep (Stock Image) Death: West died on March 10, 1977. While some reports say West overdosed on prescription pills, others say she died due to complications of a car accident . The car carrying West's body was placed in a crate which was then lowered into the ground by a large crane. The grave was 19 feet long, 10 feet wide, and nine feet deep, the Houston Chronicle reports. The large grave was then covered with cement to prevent vandalism and looting. Though few friends and no known members of West's family attended the 24-minute burial, according to the Guard, many went just to see the unusual burial for themselves. 'I just wanted to see how it was done,' one man told the United Press International, as reported by the Guard. 'If you can afford it, why not?' Husband: West and her Italian sports car were flown to San Antonio to be buried next to her late oil tycoon husband, Ike West Jr. West's coffin has since been covered by a grassy patch with only a tombstone commemorating the heiress and her extraordinary burial. However, thousands of tourists and history buffs have visited the historic cemetery since the burial took place to catch a glimpse of the cite that once gained national attention. The historic cemetery is also a stop on many San Antonio tours and West's plot is featured as one of the cemetery's notable graves with a fascinating tale, My San Antonio reports. Other prominent graves in the historic cemetery include John Kampmann, a builder; John Lang Sinclair, composer of 'The Eyes of Texas'; and Clara Driscoll, who is credited by historians to have helped save the Alamo, according to a San Antonio tour website.","Sandra West died in 1977 and was buried in the front seat of her Ferrari wearing a white nightgown in San Antonio, Texas .

"Julien Macdonald is unapologetic about his love for high octane glamour, but his AW15 collection was a departure from the usual feast of glitter and sequins he's made his signature. Indeed, the Welsh designer and Strictly Come Dancing star isn't the first - and won't be the last - designer to embrace gothic glamour in London this season.

Julien's AW15 collection was a departure from the usual feast of glitter and sequins but one dress, right, stuck to his signature style . Clearly keeping his clientele in mind, his red carpet-ready dresses were form-fitting and embellished with subtle smatterings of sequins. His beauty look, which FEMAIL witnessed being crafted backstage by legendary Val Garland using L'Oreal Paris, was as glossy as his designs. Skin was flawless and models were treated to a cashmere complexion, which was juxtaposed against high shine lids and lips. 'I took a tough Berlin chicness and relocated it into the world of Julien Macdonald,' she said backstage. Hair supremo Syd Hayes completed the look by giving models' hair a perfect gel gloss over. With an exhaustive list of paparazzi favourites - including Rosie Fortescue, Millie Mackintosh, Tamara Ecclestone, Rochelle Humes and Michelle Keegan - occupying the front row, one thing's for sure: the designs witnessed here today won't be hanging around Julien's showroom for long.

Governed by long sharp lines and jacquard cuts, Mariana Jungmann worked with soft leathers that defined traditional feminine shapes. Jungmann’s signature use of Renaissance lace has evolved in her AW15 collection through stitching techniques that constructed a bold yet fluid appearance, which took to a great start to London Fashion Week on Friday. Using a combination of warm tones of black, teal and tan, Jungmann contrasts the natural shades with strong cuts and forms. Laser cut textiles contrast with depressed imprints on leather textiles between pieces. The ‘Hypnagogia’ collection works with these techniques while embracing the modern businesswoman through some looks, and bold feminine eveningwear in others. Striking fur pieces worked with the long tailored lines that Jungmann adopted while the mixture of textiles was what stood out. Report by Eleni Mitzali .

"The chilling text messages a young father sent to his ex before allegedly murdering their two young children were revealed in court on Friday. Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas, is accused of strangling his two sons, Gatlin, 2, and Luke, who was just 8-months-old in April 2011. This shortly after he sent a string of chilling and odd text messages to their mother telling her he planned to kill the boys because of her partying ways while possibly pretending to be his new girlfriend. Gabriel Armandariz reportedly sent text messages threatening to kill his two sons to the boys' mother Karen Smith (above) shortly before strangling them . Gatlin, 2, and Luke, who was just 8-months-old (above), were found dead in a crawl space in April 2011 . In one text massage Armandariz wrote, 'I commend the spirits of these two boys to the Lord. I would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends' 'I commend the spirits of these two boys to the Lord. I would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends,' wrote Armandariz to his ex, Lauren Smith, just hours before the boys are believed to have died. This was quickly followed by another in which he wrote; 'Look, I’m trying to offer you another opportunity to see our children. But as usual you would much rather be with your friends.' According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, prosecutors in the case argued that Smith was not even aware the texts were coming from Armandariz, and actually believed they were coming from the woman he was dating at the time. This seems to be backed up by the woman's responses to these texts, as she wrote in one; 'If I were you I’d get the hell away from him. Looks can be deceiving.' On the day the boys died, Armandariz also sent a photo to Smith that appeared to show Luke dead and dangling from the closet with rope around his neck. This was followed by the final text, which also showed both boys alive and lying next to him, and read; 'We love u, goodbye.' Armandiriz also reportedly sent a photo to Smith of Luke dead and hanging from the ceiling of the closet with a rope around his neck . Armadiriz later told a 911 operator that his girlfriend made him strangle the boys . Earlier in the week, Lt. James Reeves revealed that after seeing the picture of Lukje hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin. 'We were operating on the belief that Luke was dead,' Reeves said. 'We didn’t know about the older son.' That is when they found a tarp in the crawl space under the home. 'We saw four little feet inside the tarp,' Lt. Reeves said. 'One of the feet had a shoe on it. It was a little camel tennis shoe and that’s how we knew. We never laid eyes on the bodies other than to see those feet.' Prosecutors claim that Armandariz strangled both boys with handle of a cloth grocery back before putting their bodies in a pillowcase that he then wrapped in a tarp and shoved into the crawl space. Armandariz's bizarre 911 call shortly after he killed the boys was also played for the jury this week, in which he told the operator; 'My girlfriend asked me to kill my babies. What was I supposed to do? My girlfriend told me to kill both of them. What was I supposed to do? I hate her, I hate her, I hate her so much. I’m so scared now.' Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the case, .","Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas, is accused of strangling his two sons, Gatlin, 2, and Luke, who was just 8-months-old in April 2011 .

"It might sound, well, a bit bananas, but making your bread and cakes with green banana flour could be a healthier way to satisfy your carb cravings. The flour – which does not actually taste of bananas – contains resistant starch, a type of carbohydrate which behaves like fibre by helping to control blood sugar levels and keeping us fuller for longer. And because resistant starch cannot be completely absorbed by the body, we take fewer calories from it. Scroll down for video . Green banana flour sold by Nutryttiva comes from unripened bananas grown in Brazil (file picture) Like bananas, the flour has high levels of potassium, which helps control the electrical activity of the heart, and magnesium, which aids nerve and muscle activity. James Taylor-Grime, whose company Nutryttiva sources the ingredient from unripened bananas grown in Brazil, said: ‘We only started selling it last month, but so far sales are doubling each week.’ ‘At £10 for a 400g packet it’s more expensive than your average self-raising, but you don’t need as much of it. ‘You use about 25 per cent less than normal wheat flour when baking. ‘Taste-wise it has a slightly nutty, clean flavour, but it is almost flavourless. It can also be added into smoothies and salad dressings.’ Ursula Philpot, consultant dietitian and senior lecturer at Leeds Beckett University, said banana flour could also help those who needed a high-fibre diet. The flour – which does not actually taste of bananas – contains resistant starch, a type of carbohydrate which behaves like fibre by helping to control blood sugar levels and keeping us fuller for longer (file picture) Gluten-free, and with a subtle nutty flavour, the banana flour can be substituted for ordinary wheat flour in nearly every recipe, converts claim. Ordinary starch, found in regular bread, potatoes and pasta, is rapidly digested in the small intestine and absorbed as glucose into the blood. But not all resistant starch is absorbed by the small intestine, so sugar is released into the blood more slowly, and insulin levels don’t rise as quickly. This prevents a subsequent drop in blood sugar levels - which makes us feel hungry. Ursula Philpot, consultant dietitian and senior lecturer at Leeds Beckett University, said: ‘The resistant starch in green bananas slows the release of food through the gut which helps slow the insulin response. ‘This will have a knock-on effect on weight management by controlling blood sugar levels throughout the day. ‘It can help some types of IBS sufferers as well – those who need a high fibre diet.’","Green banana flour could be a healthier way to satisfy your carb cravings .

"An ex-Marine charged with shooting 'American Sniper' author Chris Kyle and another man was not legally insane, a prosecution expert said, suggesting the man may have gotten some of his ideas from the television show Seinfeld. Prosecutors called rebuttal witnesses Friday in the trial of Eddie Ray Routh, who is charged with killing Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield. Routh's attorneys, who are pursuing an insanity defense, rested their case Thursday. Dr. Randall Price, a forensic psychologist, testified Friday that Routh had a paranoid disorder made worse by his use of alcohol and marijuana, calling his condition 'cannabis-induced psychosis.' Scroll down for video . Not schizophrenic: Clinical-forensic psychologist and neuropsychologist J. Randall Price, left, testifies that he does not believe Routh's insanity claim . Claims sanity: Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Arambula said Routh's actions do not meet the legal definition of insanity under state criminal law . Accused of murder: Eddie Ray Routh walks to his seat in court  after a break during his capital murder trial on Friday in which he is trying to plea insanity . 'In my opinion, he did know what he was doing was wrong, and he did it anyway,' Price said. A defense witness, Dr. Mitchell H. Dunn, testified Thursday that Routh had schizophrenia and showed signs of the illness for as long as two years before the February 2013 shootings. Dunn said Routh described seeing neighbors and friends as turning into pig-human hybrids. Price repeatedly accused Routh of 'setting the stage' for an insanity defense. He suggested Routh may have gotten the idea from 'Seinfeld' or the TV show 'Boss Hog.' In a 'Seinfeld' episode, one character, Kramer, believes he has discovered a 'pig-man.' 'I don't know for a fact that he saw that episode of ""Seinfeld"" but I do know that he's watched ""Boss Hog,'"" Price said. 'For a long time, he's talked a lot about pigs to a lot of people. So it's suspicious.' Shot dead: Chris Kyle, a former Navy SEAL and author of the book American Sniper, pictureed in 2012, was shot to death .

The defense: Defense attorney R. Shay Isham, leans in to listen to Eddie Ray Routh during his capital murder trial at the Erath County, Donald R. Jones Justice Center on Friday . He and another prosecution expert, Dr. Michael Arambula, said Routh's actions do not meet the legal definition of insanity under state criminal law. 'Any time intoxication is present, the game is over,' Arambula testified. The 27-year-old Routh faces mandatory life in prison without parole if convicted of capital murder, since prosecutors have said they are not seeking the death penalty. The jury can also find Routh not guilty by reason of insanity, in which case the trial judge can begin proceedings to have Routh committed. Interest in the trial has been driven by the Oscar-nominated film based on Kyle's life. The movie ends with a depiction of Kyle meeting Routh, who he was taking to a gun range after Routh's mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son. Routh's friends and family have testified that his behavior in the weeks before the shootings was increasingly erratic. They said he acted as if he believed that someone was going to hurt him and that the government was listening to him. Kyle made more than 300 kills as a sniper for SEAL Team 3, according to his own count. After leaving the military, he volunteered with veterans facing mental health problems, often taking them shooting.

"An Iowa jury has taken less than a day to acquit Theresa 'Terri' Supino of the 1983 slayings of her estranged husband and his girlfriend in a brutal cold case that has come to be known as the Copper Dollar Ranch murders. Steven Fisher, 20, and his girlfriend Melisa Gregory, 17, were bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer at the ranch where they worked in what police at the time described as a 'crime of passion'. On March 3, 2014 - exactly 31 years to the day of the crime - Supino was arrested and charged with double homicide at her Des Moines home, but police refused to reveal the new break that lead them to her. As the not guilty verdict was handed down in Waterloo on Friday, a defiant Supino, 57, told reporters she's ready for police to 'leave me the hell alone', according to The Des Moines Register. Not guilty: On Friday, Theresa 'Terri' Supino was acquitted of killing her estranged husband, Steven Fisher, and his girlfriend, Melisa Gregory, in a brutal 1983 homicide known as the Copper Dollar Ranch murders . 'Leave me alone': Theresa Supino had a message for police as she addressed the media on Friday, February 20, 2015, after she was acquitted of two counts of first-degree murder . Theresa Supino waits for a jury's verdict Friday February 20, 2015, in Black Hawk County District Court in Waterloo, Iowa. Jurors acquitted Supino of two counts of first-degree murder . Supino's defense attorneys argued over the 10-day trial that there was no physical evidence linking her to the gruesome beating deaths, which left the bodies of the two victims so badly disfigured, investigators initially thought they had been repeatedly shot in the head. They claimed the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department called upon the TV show Cold Justice to help them solve the murders, after an investigation spanning three decades failed to show up anything. The show features a former prosecutor, crime scene investigator and homicide detective, who re-investigate cold cases, according to Who TV. The defense claimed police only arrested Supino in order to give the Cold Justice episode a good ending, saying the whole process was 'a joke'. Supino said Friday she is now consulting her lawyers as to whether she should sue the show. Prosecutors, however, said Supino was a jealous wife who 'snapped' when her husband left her their two kids and quickly took up with a younger woman. Cold case: Theresa 'Terri' Supino, 53, was arrested and charged with the grisly murder of her husband and his girlfriend on the 31st anniversary of their deaths . Victims: Steven Fisher, 20 (left), and Melisa Gregory, 17 (right) were found bludgeoned to death on March 3, 1983 at the Copper Dollar Ranch in Newton, Iowa. The case had been cold for over 30 years . Scene: The bodies of Steven Fisher and Melisa Gregory are taken away following their bludgeon deaths on March 3, 2983 . Supino and Fisher had two children together and were still married at the time of his death, however they had separated. Fisher had started stating Gregory, who he worked with at the at the Copper Dollar Ranch, a horse ranch about four miles northwest of Newton. On March 2, 1983, the pair had spent the night together at the ranch in a trailer Fisher had been living in. The next day a co-worker found their brutally-beaten bodies just before 8am. Fisher was found lying face down near the barn, wearing only blue jeans. Gregory was inside the trailer about 50 meters away. Then: Terri Supino seen here with the two children she had with Steven Fisher around the time of Fisher and girlfriend Melisa Gregory's murder in 1983 . Terri Supino was married to 20-year-old Steven Fisher though they were separated. Fisher and his girlfriend, 17-year-old Melisa Gregory,were found dead on March 3, 1983 at the ranch were Fisher worked in Jasper County. Supino has now been acquitted of the murders . The gruesome murders rocked the tiny town, however police said that while they had a suspect, there was not enough evidence to arrest them. An FBI profiler called in to help with the investigation called the case a 'crime of passion' that was 'up close and personal' and done by someone 'who was angry'. According to BethBardner.com, with all the time that has passed, many people, including family members of Melisa Gregory, had long ago decided Supino was innocent. Fox News reported last year that, in a written statement, Jasper County Sheriff John Halferty said their investigation was still far from over and urged people with additional information to come forward. 'In the 31 years since the deaths of Steven and Melisa, the deputies, officers, agents, criminalists and many others have remained dedicated to assuring this case was never forgotten,' he said. Iowa woman has been charged in the grisly 1983 killings of her estranged husband and his girlfriend, who were found bludgeoned to death at the Copper Dollar Ranch in Iowa (pictured) Halferty told the Newton Daily News he started looking into the cold case in 2003. He said he knew Gregory from junior high school and that her murder had forever stayed in the back of his mind. He started 'digging into' the case when he was in a position to do so. 'I was new to junior high and I just remember how friendly she was to me,' Halferty said at a vigil in 2013. 'I live with that memory, and I'm in a position now where I think it is time. 'There are people locally that can help us with this case, and we're asking you to come forward and talk to us.'","Theresa 'Terri' Supino, 57, found not guilty of double murder Friday .

"An Arizona academic is asking a New Mexico court to order a death certificate for Billy the Kid to settle questions about whether the infamous outlaw was actually killed in 1881. Robert J. Stahl, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University, filed a petition Wednesday in state District Court and says a death certificate would end tales that the Kid wasn't fatally shot by Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. According to the official story, the brother of the outlaw's love interest tipped off Garrett, who eventually gunned down the 21-year-old Kid at the woman's Fort Sumner home on July, 14 1881. Billy the Kid: An Arizona academic is asking a New Mexico court to order a death certificate for Billy the Kid (photographed) to settle questions about whether the infamous outlaw was actually killed in 1881 . 'Quien es?' the outlaw asked before he was shot. 'Who is it?' Garrett later collected a $500 reward, indicating that territorial officials accepted the lawman's account. For decades, Billy the Kid has been an important figure in New Mexico's Old West past and any story mentioning him often generates a lot of attention, as well as a lot of disagreements over historic detail . Some claim Garrett shot someone else, and Billy took up ranching and farming or escaped to Texas, living under an assumed name. Stahl had gone to the state office that registers births and deaths and was told he'd need a court order for a death certificate to be issued. End Tales: Robert J. Stahl, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University, says a death certificate would end tales that the Kid wasn't fatally shot by Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett (photographed) in 1881 . Figure: Billy the Kid became a central figure in a violent, Irish-English land war in New Mexico. He was beloved by Mexican-American ranchers who felt discriminated against by racist white bankers and land thieves . In July 2013, his article on the fate of Billy the Kid's trigger finger, floating in alcohol in a mason jar, was featured in True West Magazine. Stahl has written a 29-page petition containing a detailed account of the documentary record and extracts from the testimony of eyewitnesses that he believes show beyond any doubt that the Kid died by a bullet from Garrett's pistol. District Judge Albert Mitchell, in court in Las Vegas, New Mexico, on Thursday, has not yet had time to act on the matter, according to clerk Kerri Webb. In an interview, Stahl said an official death certificate would 'relieve a lot of doubt as to whether Billy the Kid died that night and was buried the next day.' Tales: Some claim Garrett (left) shot someone else, and Billy took up ranching and farming or escaped to Texas, living under an assumed name, Stahl aims to put those tales to rest . Scene: Here, the scene of Billy the Kid's death is depicted. Garrett (center) is seen shooting at Billy (left) in Fort Sumner in 1881 . Stahl said there are many continuing fallacies about the Kid. While at the Billy the Kid Museum in Fort Sumner, for example, he heard one story claiming that the Kid was shot and killed in Mexico. A museum employee told him they get questions about the outlaw's death 'all the time.' The official document would 'end a lot of people's doubts,' Stahl said, and 'undermine supporters of Brushy Bill and other impostors.' Born Henry McCarty, likely in New York City, Billy the Kid came to New Mexico with his mother while searching for a better economic future. He became a central figure in a violent, Irish-English land war in New Mexico. He was beloved by Mexican-American ranchers who felt discriminated against by racist white bankers and land thieves. Hide Out: The house, built in 1878 (photographed), where the infamous outlaw hid out while evading capture is on the market for $545,000 . Although he apparently died 134 years ago, Billy the Kid still makes news. In 2003, there was a proposal to exhume his body to compare the DNA to that of his mother, but the exact location of his remains is in doubt. Also, the house, built in 1878, where the infamous outlaw hid out while evading capture is on the market for  $545,000. Early in his first term, Gov. Bill Richardson drew headlines by hinting that he was looking into a posthumous pardon for the Kid.","Robert Stahl, an Arizona State University professor emeritus, is asking the state of New Mexico to issue an official death certificate for Billy the Kid .

"Screening checkpoints can be the biggest hassle for air travellers who are in a rush, but the world’s busiest airport is promising to trim the experience to just 20 seconds. Officials at Dubai International Airport are preparing to launch a new system that they insist will boost security while slashing the passenger-checking procedures to less than 20 seconds, Arabian Business reported. It comes as the government-owned airport experiences rapid growth and expects its traffic to surge from 70.5 million international passengers in 2014 to more than 100 million in 2020. Dubai International Airport says its passenger-checking procedures will be slashed to just 20 seconds . Dubai stole London Heathrow’s crown last year, becoming the world’s busiest international airport as it emerges as a major hub for long-haul flights between Asia and the West. With it expecting another year-to-year increase, Dubai International is looking at ways to ease congestion and get people in and out of the airport as quickly as possible. Obaid Mohair bin Suroor, deputy director general of Dubai’s General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), told Arabian Business that it will launch an Advance Passenger Information System (APIS). He said it will gradually be phased in, starting with Emirates’ first and business class passengers before expanding to economy class passengers and other carriers. The system will be used for cruise ship passengers by the middle of this year. A similar system is already in use in the US, and it requires travellers to submit their passport information, date of birth and a few other details before they check in. Dubai International Airport serves as the base for Emirates, the largest carrier in the Middle East . Dubai has become one of the world’s busiest airspaces in just a matter of years, with direct flights to 149 cities which have populations of more than one million. It serves as the base for Emirates, the largest carrier in the Middle East. Emirates, along with other luxury Gulf carriers, have helped to propel Dubai airport’s growth by seizing a bigger share of travel between the West, Asia and Australasia. Dubai's main airport is planning to boost its annual capacity to 90 million passengers with a new hall . Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International, said: ‘It is truly remarkable to see the progress that Dubai has made over the years to become the world-class centre of aviation that it is today. ‘Dubai is exemplary of the heights that can be reached when governments fully support aviation and understand its potential to be a powerful driver of social and economic progress.’ Paul Griffiths, Dubai International Airport’s CEO, previously said it will handle a record 79 million passengers in 2015. It plans to boost its annual capacity to 90 million passengers this year with the opening of a new hall for arrivals and departures as part of a $7.8bn expansion plan (approximately £5bn).","Dubai airport recently named world's busiest for international travel .

"Pensioners could be hit by a tax raid to fund Ed Miliband’s plans to cut university fees . Pensioners could be hit by a tax raid to fund Ed Miliband’s plans to cut university fees, it emerged last night. The Labour leader is expected to announce details of the party’s policy to lower tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 within days, but is yet to agree with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on how the £2billion scheme could be funded. It emerged last night that one option being considered by Mr Balls is cutting some of the tax breaks handed to people saving for a pension. Pension tax breaks are worth about £24billion in total each year and have already been cut by Chancellor George Osborne. More money could be saved by lowering the £40,000 ceiling on the amount savers can put aside each year tax-free or cutting the lifetime tax-free limit of £1.25million per pension, The Times reported last night. Lord Mandelson weighed into the row yesterday, admitting Mr Miliband’s policy was not yet finished and insisting Labour must say where it will find the money. Otherwise, he said, it would face a ‘credibility gap’ over its plans to cut the deficit. The former business secretary, who was in charge of universities in Gordon Brown’s government, said it was ‘inconceivable’ that Labour could cut funding to the sector. He told academics and university administrators in London: ‘If any reduction in fees is announced, and I’m not assuming that it will be, it’s absolutely vital that replacement funding from taxation is identified and announced at the same time. ‘Not in a generalised way, but in a specific way. Because that will ensure that no credibility gap is opened up either around university funding or the Labour Party’s commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit.’ He supported Government claims that the rise to £9,000 fees had not led to a fall in applications, pointing out that even the poorest students were now more likely to apply. Lord Mandelson also said cutting fees for UK students could increase the rate at which universities recruit from abroad to plug the funding gap – potentially ‘at the expense’ of home applicants. When he campaigned for the Labour leadership, Mr Miliband proposed a graduate tax as an alternative to tuition fees. But Labour is yet to agree on its stance ahead of the election. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said cutting fees to £6,000 would be ‘foolish’, costing £10billion over five years . Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said cutting fees to £6,000 would be ‘foolish’, costing £10billion over five years. ‘[It] would be a populist gesture which would achieve nothing and do a lot of damage,’ he wrote to Mr Miliband. Critics of cutting fees point out that the benefits would mainly go to the highest-earning graduates as they would end up paying less. A Labour Party spokesman said its policy on university fees would be ‘set out shortly’. n A pact between Labour and the SNP would be ‘the ultimate nightmare scenario’ that could break up Britain, David Cameron warned yesterday. He accused a ‘spineless’ Ed Miliband of betraying the Union by refusing to rule out a deal with the Scottish Nationalists.","Pensioners could be hit by a tax raid to fund Ed Miliband’s tuition fee plans .

"A Brazilian rent boy whose claims of drug-fuelled sex forced a Tory MP to quit as a minister's aide says he will name another Westminster client. Rogerio Santos contacted a publicist this week claiming he wants to reveal details about another Conservative politician in exchange for a large sum of money. Last year the male escort's allegations about Mark Menzies led the MP to resign as private secretary to the then International Development Minister Alan Duncan. Brazilian rent boy Rogerio Santos, whose claims of drug-fuelled sex forced a Tory MP to quit as a minister's aide, says he will name another Westminster client . The new claims about an as yet unidentified MP are also believed to involve sex and illegal drugs. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Mr Santos is very convincing. He wants to speak out again – but only for the right price.' The rent boy, 20, claimed the second Conservative was a 'colleague' of Mr Menzies. The source added that the new allegations would heap pressure on Mr Menzies, who plans to run again in Fylde, Lancashire, in May. The Brazilian said he and Mr Menzies met on a gay escort website and claimed the politician had given him a tour of the Houses of Parliament before allegedly offering to pay him £250 for a two-hour session. He insisted that Mr Menzies, who was one of David Cameron's 'A-listers' at the 2010 General Election, asked him to supply him with mephedrone – also known as M-Cat and Meow Meow. Last year the male escort's allegations about Mark Menzies led the MP to resign as a minister's aide . Possession of the Class B drug became a criminal offence in 2010, however no charges were brought against the MP or Mr Santos. The escort, who returned to Sao Paulo, Brazil, because his student visa had expired, made the claims to the Sunday Mirror in March last year. Mr Menzies worked for Alan Duncan, pictured . He said at the time: ‘I have been having sex with a Conservative MP for money. Mark also asked me to buy mephedrone. I have messages of him talking to me about drugs. ‘We met very regularly over the last 18 months. He took me to the Houses of Parliament. Recently, he has been asking me to buy drugs. I have SMS messages and photographic evidence.’ Mr Santos is also reported to have a photograph of Mr Menzies next to a plate of mystery white powder. Discussing the picture, Mr Santos said: ‘There is a plate of mephedrone. He asked me if I could buy methedrone. He had many drugs, a lot of drugs.’ He also claimed that he had received a text from Mr Menzies in which the MP asked ‘What underwear you have?’, and another in which he told the rent boy to meet him in south London and ‘bring sexy underwear’. The Tory MP said at the time: ‘I have decided to resign as a Parliamentary Private Secretary after a series of allegations were made against me. 'A number of these allegations are not true and I look forward to setting the record straight in due course.’","Brazilian escort says he will name Tory MP he claims to have had sex with .

"A spat between Mo Farah and a Great Britain teammate has descended into a race row amid claims fellow 10,000 metre runner Andy Vernon suggested Farah should not be representing Great Britain. Farah, who beat Vernon to 10,000 metres gold at the European Championships in Zurich last summer, alleged his teammate  suggested he did not deserve the title as he was not European. Farah made the claims when he was questioned on Friday about a Twitter spat the pair had earlier in the week. The row between Mo Farah, left, and team-mate Andy Vernon has escalated, with Vernon claiming remarks about the double Olympic champion not being European were 'tongue-in-cheek' Vernon has admitted making a remark about Farah, but said it was made in a 'jokey environment' The 10,000 metre runner has accused Farah of making an 'outrageous misrepresentation' of his comments . Vernon said any claim that he genuinely did not regard Farah as British, so he should have been given gold instead of his rival after coming second to him in Zurich, was a 'complete lie' The 31-year-old, who was born in Mogadishu in Somalia before moving to Britain as a child, has apologised for the social media row,  but admitted their past contributed to his frustrations boiling over. Vernon initially  admitted making the comments in Zurich, but insisted they were intended as 'a joke' among a group of people 'having a laugh' and apologised if they were taken out of context. But, after reading in full Farah's remarks, he labelled them 'an outrageous misrepresentation' of their 'tongue-in-cheek' chat and claimed they were designed to portray him in a bad light. He said in an interview with BBC Radio Solent: 'It's an outrageous misrepresentation of the chat we had at the Europeans. 'What I did say was completely tongue-in-cheek - in a jokey environment, we were all having fun, high spirits at the Europeans. 'It was after our race and I, in a joking way, said, ""Mo, I'm European champion"". 'That was it. I don't know where he's got that I don't discard [regard] him as British, you don't deserve to have gold, you should give it to me - it's complete lies.' Vernon added he was 'delighted' when the pair finished first and second in Europe, calling it a 'great moment for Britain' and saying he was the first to congratulate Farah. Mo Farah has spoken out about his Twitter spat with Andy Vernon, saying it was down to a comment made by his fellow distance runner that implied that he did not deserve gold at the European Championships in 2014 . Farah said: 'One comment he made, which I didn't really like, was to say that he should have won the gold' Farah is in Birmingham preparing for an indoor two-mile  record attempt at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix . 'It's annoyed me that he's come out and said this, it really has,' Vernon said. Vernon said he had tried to contract Farah's management team to apologise if the athlete was unhappy with what was said and called for a joint press conference so the pair could 'discuss what happened'. Vernon added: 'He has played the cheap shot. He has played the card. I don't know what I can do. 'If that one remark that I did make in jest was so terrible all I can do is apologise, I didn't mean any offence by it.' Farah is in Birmingham ahead of a tilt at an indoor world best time over two miles at Saturday's Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix, but the build-up to the meeting has been overshadowed by this row. Asked about the pair's history, Farah said: 'It happened in the European Championships in Zurich where he came second in the race I won. 'We were sitting down together and there were a number of staff and athletes there too. 'One comment he made, which I didn't really like, was to say that he should have won the gold. 'I was like, ""What, the gold should have been given to you?"". And I was like, because he was the only European guy? You can't say something like that. I was kind of biting my tongue at the time. 'I don't know what he meant, but at that point it hurt me. But I moved on. That was private.' The pair, who finished one-two at the European Championships, clashed on Twitter earlier in the week . Vernon did not deny that he made a comment about Farah's origins, but said it was to carry on a joke . Farah says that he and Vernon will never be 'best friends' but he regrets the way he reacted on Twitter . The pair's feud became public on Tuesday when they  were involved in a war of words on social media, Farah labelling his team-mate 'an embarrassment' after Vernon  criticised the lack of high-level competition to face Farah in Birmingham. Farah, who with three world crowns to go with his double Olympic success is arguably Britain's greatest ever athlete, added  on Friday: 'I do apologise. I should never come out publicly and say some things. 'With an athlete like him, one I've been on the podium with, it was difficult to bite my tongue. Probably the best thing to do at the time was to bite my tongue, but I couldn't do it.' A British Athletics spokesperson said the national body 'would be talking to Andy about the comment he made and reminding him of his responsibilities as a British team member'. Farah will aim to let his legs do the talking at the Barclaycard Arena on Saturday as he runs his first race of the year. The Londoner, who only returned from altitude training in Ethiopia on Thursday, could go after Kenenisa Bekele's world best time of eight minutes 4.35 seconds, which was set at the same meeting seven years ago. Farah, who holds the European best of 8mins 8.07secs and will be up against the likes of 40-year-old Bernard Lagat in Birmingham, said this week's row had given him extra motivation. 'It definitely has fired me up,' Farah said. 'What I do best is go out there and run and represent my country and to continue to win medals. 2015 is about making that bright start, then continuing through the summer.'","Double Olympic champion claimed Vernon said 'he should have won gold' at 2014 European Championships because 'he was the only European guy'

"A sex offender told investigators he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to newly unsealed police affidavits. Authorities have been searching for the remains of 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and ten-year-old Katharine Lyon on a remote mountain in Bedford County, Virginia, some 200 miles from their Montgomery County, Maryland, home, since September. A Bedford County grand jury also is investigating. The girls went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations . The Washington Post  reported Saturday that Montgomery County police, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the affidavits or how credible they find 58-year-old Lloyd Welch's recent statements. Scroll down for video . 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and ten-year-old Katharine Lyon went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations . Lloyd Welch told investigators he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to newly unsealed police affidavits . Montgomery County police, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the affidavits or how credible they find 58-year-old Lloyd Welch's recent statements . Police have named Welch and his uncle, 69-year-old Richard Welch, 'persons of interest' in the case, but neither has been charged. In an earlier letter to the newspaper, Lloyd Welch said he had nothing to do with the girls' disappearance. Richard Welch has declined to comment. 'Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon,' Montgomery Police Chief Tom Manger said Friday. 'We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation.' Richard Welch's wife, Patricia, was charged with perjury after testifying before the grand jury in December. The Lyon sisters never came home after walking to the mall together in 1975. A massive search turned up nothing. Parents John and Mary Lyon have never been able to find out what happened to their daughters. Over four decades, police have pursued numerous leads and periodically identified potential suspects. But they never charged anyone. The affidavits do not say whether any incriminating evidence has been found on Taylors Mountain in Virginia. The Lyon sisters never came home after walking to the mall together in 1975. A massive search turned up nothing . Montgomery County Police mugshot of Lloyd Welch in 1977 after Welch was arrested for a residential burglary near Wheaton Plaza . Investigators have found bones on the property, according to court papers, but that may not mean much because the land contains an old cemetery with more than 30 unmarked graves. At one point during the search, detectives wrote that a dog trained to sniff decomposition 'alerted' to areas away from the cemetery. On the day they vanished, the girls' older brother reported seeing them at the mall, and a friend claimed to have seen them talking to an older man who was carrying a microphone and a briefcase. A sketch of that man, who had long hair and a mustache, was created and circulated, but it didn't lead to any arrests. One person who provided details to a police artist said the man had been 'fixated' on the girls. Welch, who worked at a traveling carnival with his then girlfriend Helen Craver, had been at the mall and was seen paying attention to the Lyon girls, police chief Thomas Manger said. The filings detail for the first time how Lloyd Welch surfaced in the case. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. The girls' father, John Lyon, became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones . Authorities have been searching for the remains of 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and 10-year-old Katharine Lyon on a remote mountain in Bedford County, Virginia, some 200 miles from their Montgomery County, Maryland, home, since September . Police gave him a polygraph test which showed he was lying, according to the affidavits, which did not say whether authorities continued to look into Welch. The detectives on the case in 2013 set out to learn more about Welch, who had been arrested in 1977 in Montgomery in a burglary case. His mug shot from that arrest strongly resembled a sketch in the Lyon sisters case that had been drawn based on a witness's description of a man at Wheaton Plaza who was staring at the girls and following them, according to the affidavits. Investigators also found that Welch had worked as a carnival-ride operator, traveling across the country. In 1994, he had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in South Carolina. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in Delaware and was sentenced to three decades in prison. The detectives went to Delaware, according to the affidavits, and interviewed Welch several times in prison. The filings detail for the first time how Lloyd Welch surfaced in the case. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza (pictured, 1975) and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car . 'During these interviews, Lloyd Welch has admitted he left Wheaton Plaza in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared,' according to the affidavits, written by Montgomery Detective Mark Janney and Detectives R.D. Baldwin and S.O. Smith of the Bedford County Sheriff's Office. The affidavits say Lloyd Welch told police Richard Welch was involved in kidnapping the girls. Lloyd Welch said he was dropped off near his home, and the next day he went to Richard Welch's home where he saw the uncle sexually abusing one of the sisters. He said he left and never saw the girls again. Shelia and Katherine were on spring break when they decided to walk a mile from their home to the nearby Wheaton Plaza shopping center to eat pizza and see the Easter display. They left at 11am. Their mother Mary Lyon told them to be home by 4pm. Mrs Lyon later said that in the quiet Washington, D.C., suburb, it was common to let children go to the shopping center alone. As the Montgomery County Gazette put it years later - it was a simpler time when everyone looked out for everyone else's children. The massive investigation that followed the girls' disappearance brought in countless tips and widespread national and local media coverage. Though volunteers searched for the sisters, they came up with nothing. Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible . The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon would be 50 years old . Potential clues were found, but later discounted. People were brought in for questioning, but later released without charge. Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family.

"Standing at six foot two inches tall, and weighing nearly 17 stone, Tim Locks is a colossal figure and used to dealing with troublemakers. He was once a doorman at Cheekies nightclub in Staines, Surrey, throwing out drunken revellers and monitoring security before running his own construction business. Now the 38-year-old has sold his home and moved to Iraq to help fight the bloodthirsty terrorists of the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Former bouncer Tim Locks has sold his home and relocated to Iraq to join the fight against the bloodthirsty terrorists of the Islamic State . Like family: Mr Locks has joined Dwekh Nawsha, a Christian militia group, and said he feels they are 'like family' in Iraq . Mr Locks has joined a group called Dwekh Nawsha, a Christian militia whose name in Assyrian means 'the self-sacrificers'. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Locks revealed that he made his decision to relocate to Iraq last August after watching the news reports about the plight of Yazidis on Mount Sinjar. He said: 'Last summer I was at home, watching the news and I saw pictures of Mount Sinjar. I just thought I have a great life, job, beautiful house and I thought it is time to help someone else.' When asked whether he was motivated by religion, Locks said he wasn't religious but had no problem fighting for a group with strong Christian values. He said: 'I had no specific wishes to join a specific group. I just wanted to help people out here. Any society which kills people, cuts people's heads off needs to be challenged. 'I put my home on the market and started to talk with a guy online. My house sold quickly and I met up en route with my friend from online.' Finally in mid-February, Mr Locks and his new friend flew from Heathrow, via Dubai to Sulaymaniyah, the biggest city in southern Kurdistan. They paid for extra baggage, allowing them to bring around 130 kilogrammes of kit with them to Iraq. Arriving last week, Mr Locks was adamant that he had made the right choice in leaving behind his life in the UK. He said: 'Back home I had TV in every room, a swimming pool, six to eight holidays abroad a year. I did what I wanted pretty much when I wanted. 'Now I'm here helping people with next to nothing, with a group of guys I've known less than a couple of weeks but who feel like family already.' Front line: Mr Locks said he wants to confront Islamic State and added: 'I just wanted to help people out here. Any society which kills people, cuts people's heads off needs to be challenged' Inspiration: Mr Locks said he was inspired to join Dwekh Nawsha after speaking to Brett, a 28-year-old former US veteran, who was the group's first foreign fighter . When asked about his family's reaction to his decision, Locks said: 'They are petrified for my safety and that is very understandable. But they knew they would not be able to talk me out of this.' Mr Locks explained how he joined Dwekh Nawsha after speaking to Brett, a 28-year-old former US veteran who was the group's first foreign fighter. The American's honestly and approachable manner appealed to Mr Locks, who liked the openness of the group as well as its stringent recruitment process of only recruiting veterans or people with valued skills like construction. Tim also admitted that he was put off joining the popular foreign fighter group, the Lions of Rojava, or the Peshmerga, because of uncertainties over expected commitment. Rumours circulate that some groups have made foreign fighters hand over their passports in order to secure long-term service, but Tim said: 'I'm not prepared to surrender my phone and passport.' 'Brett told me: ""You are free to come and go. You can leave at anytime.""' Despite the small size of Dwekh Nawsha, the group is growing fast with dozens of people from around the world contacting them about helping out. Mr Locks explained how 'we put everyone through a vetting process. I have a big construction background and that is a massive skill out here for building bases and repairing homes'. As well as helping with construction projects in Nineveh province, Locks has been involved in logistics but is hoping to visit the frontline very soon. 'We are due to go to the frontline any day now to help train the locals and help defend the line against Daesh (Islamic State).' Mr Muscle: Mr Locks had worked as a bouncer and in construction before recently relocating to Iraq . Former life: The former builder from Bracknell in Berkshire said he will only return to the UK once Islamic State have been defeated . But the former builder from Bracknell in Berkshire was clear that he did not join Dwekh Nawsha for the attention. He said: 'I didn't come out here to be a celebrity but it is a way of gaining awareness. Some people move out here to make a name for themselves.' His comments come after last December it emerged that two former British army soldiers, James Hughes and Jamie Read, who both joined the Lions of Rojava and gave interviews about how they had fought on the frontline at Kobane. Neither soldier had been near Kobane. For Locks, the reality of the situation in Iraq has been an eye opener. He said: 'The situation out here is dire. Blankets and rice cannot defend the people against Daesh. 'The western world needs to pull their finger out. Send us some kit, send us some food. Send us weapons. If you don't send it, you are failing the world.' 'We are here. We are the boots on the ground. There is no pay. I am here to protect the local people and democracy. But we are seriously under resourced. 'Britain has done nothing to help the situation. I have done more to help people here in a week than David Cameron has done. He has done nothing.' Tim admitted that his life is now permanently under threat from Islamic State: 'We are value targets for Islamic State. We are always armed and never travel on our own.' Old friends: Mr Locks (third from right) poses with friends in a gym before his move to the Middle East . He admits that his efforts have been costing him a lot of money and said: 'I took significant funds but we are chewing it up. We purchased our own weapons as it is very expensive to buy equipment out here.' Despite the strain on his finances and the threat of Islamic State, Locks was positive about his early experiences in Nineveh. He said: 'The people here are fantastic. We have been very well looked after. We are never on our own and always have someone who speaks one of the local dialect. Daesh are far too cowardly to get us.' When asked when he planned to return to the UK, Locks admitted he was unsure how he would be received in the UK after hearing how other returnees had been monitored and questioned for hours by security services. He added: 'I don't know if I will be welcome back in the UK. I have sold my house. I have no time limit, no reason to return until the job is done. If I do leave, I may never be able to get back.' For Locks, the fight against Islamic State is his current priority and he appears wholeheartedly committed to the cause. He said: 'When Daesh is eradicated from the earth, then I will return to the UK.'","Tim Locks has joined Dwekh Nawsha to stop the spread of Islamic State .

Booking a European trip direct with villa or apartment owners rather than from a brochure can a save a family of four up to £540, The Mail on Sunday found.

"As the devious Thomas Cromwell, he cuts an imposing figure charting the treacherous waters of the Tudor court. But away from the set of Wolf Hall, Mark Rylance looks a touch less impressive stepping out of his tiny electric car. The 55-year-old actor was spotted zipping around South London in his small blue G-Wiz, which sells for around £10,000.

And the environmentally conscious star of the BBC drama also made his views known by showing an anti-fracking slogan in his back window. The sticker appeared to read ‘The F word is a dirty word’, an allusion to swearing, but smaller print after the F making clear the word was fracking. The process of drilling down into the ground to release natural gas has become a controversial topic among environmental campaigners. Rylance has never been one to hide his strong opinions on such issues. He was the main signatory of a letter to the Guardian in 2012 protesting at BP's sponsorship of the World Shakespeare Festival. Rylance as Thomas Cromwell in the hit BBC series Wolf Hall . It read: 'While the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon spill continues to devastate ecosystems and communities, and the highly polluting extraction of tar sands oil brings us rapidly closer to the point of no return from climate change, we feel that BP has no place in arts sponsorship.' He again set his sights on the oil company when it was announced as a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympic Games, for which he was due to take part in the opening ceremony. Although he eventually pulled out because of the death of his stepdaughter, he admitted to almost pulling out over what he saw as morally dubious sponsorship deals. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I thought about it. The conversation about private sponsorship being supported by taxpayer' money, and private sponsorship from companies that are not really necessarily behaving all that ethically, big questions about BP, and big questions about McDonald's and the amount of sugar and obesity that's costing the NHS billions... 'I think those questions are good and I had thought since agreeing that maybe maybe I shouldn't be doing this, and if people feel critical of us who are taking part, I think they've got a point, a very good point. 'On the other hand, all these athletes, the human endeavour aspect of it is so wonderful, I wouldn't want to stop, and I wouldn't want to be a nay-sayer or a chastiser.'","Mark Rylance drives around south London in a £10,000 electric G-Wiz car .

"An Arizona man wasn't willing to let a car that ran into him after a confrontation get away without a fight - so he jumped onto its trunk and held on for life. Justin Finch, 24, was caught on camera as he argued with some men in the parking lot of Zia Record Exchange in Phoenix. After  multiple men confronted Finch, they piled into a white car and ran him over. In the video clip, Finch can be seen miraculously getting up and grabbing onto the trunk of the vehicle as it zoomed away. Scroll down for video . Justin Finch escaped with only scrapes and bruises after pulling off this daring move in Phoenix, Arizona . At the beginning of the video, Finch (left), 24, can be seen arguing with multiple men in a parking lot . After the confrontation in the parking lot of Zia Record Exchange, the car backs into Finch and keeps going . Finch survived with just scrapes and bruises, Fox 10 reported. He said: 'It was shocking. I was scared for my life for a minute. 'I got pinched between two cars... This leg got twisted around and stuff. 'I'm like, afraid.' The car was stopped about a half mile away from the store. Police let everyone goes because no one wanted to press charges. Instead of letting himself be flattened, Finch grabbed onto the back of the car and held on for dear life . Finch held on to the trunk of the car until it was stopped by Phoenix police about a half mile away from the store . Shaina Russell, who filmed the incident, can be heard theorizing the men in the car took something valuable from Finch. Finch said the incident started after he was called a gay slur by one of the men and there was a physical confrontation. One of the people from the car, 16-year-old Orlando Munoz, claims Finch was the aggressor. He said: 'I turned around to walk outside and he assaulted me, he picked me up and I started defending myself.' Finch denies he started the fight. He said: 'They said it was a mutual thing, but I don't think it was a mutual thing because I didn't come at them, they came at me. 'I want justice.. I really do.'","Justin Finch was seen arguing in the parking of a record store in Phoenix .

"Britons have told of their terror as hundreds of residents were evacuated from one of the world's tallest residential buildings after it was engulfed in flames in the early hours of this morning in Dubai. Pictures and video footage showed a large blaze ripping through multiple floors of the Marina Torch tower, a new tower in the expat-heavy Marina district of the city. More than a dozen fire trucks were able to extinguish the flames several hours after the fire alarm went off around 2am local time. One eyewitness said flames shot out from two sides of the building as glass and metal rained down from near the summit of the 86-storey skyscraper, which stands more 330 metres tall (1,105 ft). Scroll down for video . Inferno: A massive blaze ripped through multiple storeys of the 86-storey Marina Torch tower in Dubai early Saturday . Disaster: The fire broke out early Saturday in the Torch tower on the northeastern end of the Marina district . Horror: The fire which is believed to have started on the 51st floor engulfed dozens of storeys in the skyscraper . Hazardous: The fire broke out at about 2am local time on the north-east end of the densely populated district . Kiera Doherty was asleep in her apartment in the Torch when the fire broke out. The 32-year-old told MailOnline: 'Alarms are always going off in Dubai and so I normally ignore them. 'I got a call from a friend saying ""you have got to get out, the building is on fire"". 'I was rushing down the stairs but because the fire was on the lower floor, I realised I was walking into the smoke. The further down I got on the stairs, the thicker the smoke got. 'There was an elderly lady taking it one step and a time and people carrying babies. I live on the 56th floor and it took about 20 minutes to get all the way down. 'Because there was so much burning cladding coming off the side of the building, falling onto the street, we couldn't get out. 'There was a gap in the falling cladding and I ran across the road. A piece of burning cladding fell on my shoulder. And Melanie Parkes, a British teacher who lives in the building, said 'there were huge pieces of debris falling and being carried by the wind'. She added: 'It was a really surreal experience, especially when we actually saw the fire outside. Mostly people were in shock and some were even crying. It looked like something out of film set.' Burned: External cladding on the corner of more than two dozen storeys from roughly the 51st floor to the top of the Torch (pictured) were mangled and charred black . Scorched: The flammable cladding on the outside of the building was incinerated in the blaze and crashed down to the ground below . Beacon: Dozens of stories in the 86-storey Torch skyscraper left several apartments severely damaged . Aftermath: Two men inspect the damage on the decimated balcony of one of the apartments in the Torch . Damage: Parts of the flammable cladding - which fell and set fire to lower parts of the building - fell on resident's balconies . Falling debris: Even the apartments that bore no visible signs of damage were littered with charred cladding . Off limits: One resident of the Marina Torch took this picture from his balcony - showing the charred debris polluting the building's outdoor pool . British ex-pat Sharjeel Khawaja from London, who lives on the 26th floor, told 7 Days In Dubai that ignored the fire alarm because he thought it was coming from the construction site nearby. He said: 'I woke up around 6am to find missed calls from my family and a mate that lives in the same building. 'I went out into the corridor and the sprinklers were on and there was water everywhere. 'When I got outside [on the street] everyone was gathered around watching what was happening. I must have been one of the last out of the building.' The director of Dubai Civil Defence, said: 'The incident proved Dubai Civil Defence's ability to control the fire and stop it from spreading to the tower's other wings and to nearby buildings by following strict protocols to break in quickly and reach the source of the fire on the 51st floor.' As daylight broke, residents waiting to check the extent of the damage at their homes could see the external cladding on the corners of the building was charred black and mangled for dozens of floors. Clean-up crews dressed in orange uniforms swept up pieces of shattered glass and other debris covering the street outside the building. Safety risk: Police blocked off areas around the Torch, which still had power, and the lights were on in many of the flats . Alert: Two residents of the Torch (not pictured) said they were told the fire started around the 52nd floor . Emergency: A resident of the Marina Torch, Steve Short, 53, of Liverpool, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly . Destruction: High winds whipped through the area and debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze appeared to be extinguished . Evacuation: Thousands of residents abandoned the high-rise Marina Torch and the neighboring buildings when it caught on fire and debris began falling all around . Major General Rashid Al Matroushi said around 100 officers from nine civil defence stations took part in putting out the blaze. Two residents of the Torch, who were evacuated from the building, were told the fire started on the 52nd floor. They said the flaming material fell and set lower parts of the building ablaze. Steve Short, 53, of Liverpool, praised the work of firefighters who arrived quickly. He said fire alarms alerted residents to the blaze and building management sent workers knocking on doors to ensure residents got out. Residents of at least one neighboring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution because of strong winds, but they were later allowed back inside. Flammable: The same blackened external material on the Torch (pictured) was blamed for another fire at a luxury Dubai complex in November 2012 . Cleanup: As daylight broke, residents waiting across the street to be allowed back home were able to see the extent of the blaze . Engulfed: Residents of the Marina Torch (left) said falling debris from where the fire started set lower floors alight too . Flaming material falling from the initial fire then set a lower part of the building ablaze, residents have said . Another resident of The Torch said residents were nervous coming out but fire crews were able to bring the situation under control. 33-year-old RJ Morlock said: 'I was really surprised they got it under control pretty quickly,' he said. 'It looked like it was going to go up.' The blaze spread through at least 15 floors as high winds whipped through the area, on the northeastern end of the densely populated Marina district. Police blocked off areas around the skyscraper, which still had power during the fire and lights were on in many of the apartments inside. Debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze was extinguished. Police on the scene had no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. Thousands were evacuated after the blaze, which reportedly started on the 51st floor, spread quickly . The 86-storey Marina Torch tower (centre) stands more 330 metres tall (1,105 ft) He said: 'There have been three fire alarms every week recently and all were false. This time I heard it and said it must be false. 'But then I smelt smoke. I took my wallet and ran down along with my wife.' Digby Taylor, head of operations at GN Broadcasting, added: 'This building has been plagued since opening with false fire alarms on an almost daily basis.' The Marina area is home to dozens of towering apartment blocks and hotels, many of them built over the past decade. The apartments are popular with Dubai's large number of expatriate professionals. Tamweel blaze: According to Gulf Business , some experts blamed faulty air-conditioning caused the accident while others have said sub-standard cladding material caused the blaze . As daylight broke in Dubai this morning, the external cladding on the corners of the Marina Torch building were mangled and charred black. In November 2012, experts blamed the same external coating for the inferno that engulfed another luxury Dubai development known as the Jumeirah Lake Towers (JLT). The blaze at the 34-storey Tamweel Tower forced a mass evacuation of residents who lost all their worldly belongings. According to Gulf Business, some experts blamed faulty air-conditioning caused the accident while others have said sub-standard cladding material caused the blaze. 'As is evident from the videos, the fire started at the roof of building, and that might have been due to a short-circuit or over heating of any of the equipments installed on the roof,'  Noman Qamar, project manager at fire protection company Aldes, told Gulf Business. Blaze: In November 2012 (pictured) , experts blamed the same external coating for the inferno that engulfed another luxury Dubai development known as the Jumeirah Lake Towers (JLT) He added: 'The fire spread rapidly to other parts of the building mainly due to falling debris of the flammable cladding that was used on the tower, which is similar to other incidences that occurred in other residential towers.' The tower's cladding burned downwards in the early hours of Sunday morning, making hundreds of residents homeless, The National reported at the time. The Dubai Police forensic department has released its findings on the fire, which burnt half the building. According to the report, the fire started at the back of the building on the ground floor where the waste material was left by the labourers working on a shop in the building. The waste material contained papers, tapes and woods which fuelled the .","Flaming debris was seen falling from the skyscraper in videos of the blaze .

"Diamonds may be a girl's best friend – but they are not exactly kind to her wallet. Unless she shops at Avon, that is. For the mail order make-up firm has launched a bargain diamond necklace that costs just £25. The pendant is made of sterling silver with the gemstone set in the centre, and will be sold door-to-door by Avon representatives in the run up to Mother's Day. Affordable:  Mail order make-up firm Avon has launched a bargain diamond necklace that costs just £25 . The company hopes it will appeal to Britain's thrifty middle classes, who are increasingly happy to buy luxury goods such as smoked salmon and champagne at cut-price supermarkets Aldi and Lidl. On a budget: The silver and diamond necklace costs £25 from Avon . It follows the success of Avon's £30 diamond earrings, which sold out in just nine days after being launched last year. Two pairs of earrings, which were encrusted with 32 tiny diamonds amounting to 0.2 carats, were sold each minute in the run up to Christmas. And although Avon's latest necklace contains just 0.01 carats, the firm believes simply having the chance to buy a genuine precious stone for such a low price will be enough to appeal to customers. 'We are proud to invest in high-end items, such as diamonds, and make them accessible to all our deserving customers from the comfort of their homes,' said Anthony Wells, Avon's marketing executive. 'We are happy that mothers across the UK will be receiving this extra special gift.' The company said all their diamonds were responsibly sourced from Africa, before being ethically cut and polished in India. Around a third of UK women are Avon customers, and the firm sells more than 3.5billion products around the world each year.","Pendant made from sterling silver with gemstone set in middle .

This all comes exactly two weeks after Kylie's father and Kim and Khloe's step-dad, Bruce Jenner, was involved in  a fatal car accident. Authorities recently said they have not determined who is at fault in that crash, though recently released video seems to show Jenner rear-ending two cars, including the one carrying the woman who was killed. The driver, Kim Howe, 69, was killed when she was struck head-on by a Hummer as her car drove into the opposite lane. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter. Jenner is not in Montana with the girls, and was seen moving out of his Malibu home on Friday. The former Olympian packed up his belongings into a rusty Ford truck and headed for his new home.

"The teenage boy who committed suicide after an alleged plot to carry out a massacre at a Canadian mall on Valentine's Day was foiled was the source who tipped off police, it has been suggested. James Gamble, 19, reportedly shot himself as armed officers surrounded his home in Timberlea, Halifax, last Friday following a tip-off about a planned mass shooting at Halifax Shopping Centre. He is alleged to have been involved in the plot - which was thwarted by police at the last minute - alongside Lindsay Souvannarath, 23, from Illinois, and  Randall Shepherd, 20, from Nova Scotia. But now, it has been implied that Gamble was the 'anonymous person' who alerted Halifax Police Department to the 'murderous scheme' via Crimestoppers last Thursday, likely saving many lives. Scroll down for video . Source? James Gamble (pictured),  who committed suicide after an alleged plot to carry out a massacre at a Canadian mall on Valentine's Day was foiled, was the source who tipped off police, it has been suggested . Linked to 'plot': The 19-year-old (pictured, left and right, in online images) reportedly shot himself as armed officers surrounded his home in Timberlea, Halifax, last Friday following a tip-off about the 'mass shooting' At his funeral on Saturday, Pastor Michael Cody, Gamble's uncle, referred to the teenager as a 'wonderful young gentleman' who helped to avert a tragedy by doing a 'good deed'. 'Take comfort in the fact Jamie overcame evil,' Mr Cody told friends and family at a funeral home in Upper Tantallon, Nova Scotia. 'He overcame evil by doing the good deed that he did.' He added: 'Take comfort in the fact that you know Jamie made a decision. Because of what he decided to do, so many lives are saved today... Jamie sided with good and he defeated evil. 'Jamie laid down his life to save his brothers…Take resolve in the fact that you know that Jamie loved everybody so much that he was prepared to end what could have been a tragedy.' Although police have not confirmed who gave the tip that led to the unraveling of the alleged plot, many of Gamble's friends have speculated it was the boy himself who provided the information. When police eventually stormed Gamble's parents' home in Tiger Maple Drive - where the teenager committed suicide - they discovered three long-barreled guns on the premises, CBC reported.

Charged: Although police have not confirmed who gave the tip that led to the unraveling of the alleged plot, many of Gamble's friends have speculated it was the boy himself. Above, Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath (left, in her high school yearbook photo) and Randall Shepherd, 20, have been charged in connection with the 'plot' 'There were three long-barrelled rifles seized during the investigation and all three were seized at the residence,' Nova Scotia RCMP Commanding Officer Brian Brennan told reporters last week. During the service, photos of Gamble were scattered around The Ronald A. Walker Funeral Home. They showed the teenager as a chubby toddler, and as a child half-buried in sand at the beach. Reverend Reg Harrison  described Gamble as 'a wonderful young gentleman in every sense of the word' and recalled various happy moments from the boy's life, The Chronicle Herald reported. The teenager's family reportedly asked for donations to be made in his name to animal shelters. It comes just four days after petite, dark-haired Souvannarath and Shepherd, who has shoulder-length blond hair, appeared in court over their alleged plans for a Columbine-like shooting spree. In court: It comes just four days after petite, dark-haired Souvannarath (pictured) and Shepherd, who has shoulder-length blond hair, appeared in court over their alleged plans for a Columbine-like shooting spree . The pair did not speak as they were arraigned on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and arson as well as unlawful communication of a threat 'through social media' to cause harm or death. Above, Shepherd . The pair did not speak as they were arraigned on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and arson as well as unlawful communication of a threat 'through social media' to cause harm or death. They were arrested at Halifax Airport last Friday after police received the tip about their plot 'to go to a public venue in the Halifax region on February 14th with a goal of opening fire to kill citizens'. Shepherd and Gamble, who were childhood friends, apparently met Souvannarath online. The woman later traveled to the airport to meet Shepherd, where she was detained by officers. All three suspects admired the teenagers who killed 12 students and a teacher during a high school shooting spree in 1999 in Columbine, Colorado, according to media reports on their backgrounds. Shauna MacDonald, prosecuting, said outside court that the conspiracy charges stem from the fact that while no act was committed, there had been an agreement to commit the crimes. 'The burden in any criminal charge for the police is reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been committed,' she said. 'The basis of conspiracy is an agreement, so it can be a conversation.' During Tuesday's hearing, Shepherd and Souvannarath were also charged with weapons offences. Although they did not seek bail but Ms MacDonald said they may do so in a future hearing. The suspects were both represented by the same duty counsel, but the prosecutor said she expected they would seek their own lawyer or lawyers in the coming days. Intended target: Shepherd and Souvannarath were arrested at Halifax Airport last Friday after police received the tip about their plot to go to Halifax Shopping Centre (pictured) 'with a goal of opening fire to kill citizens' Chilling: Souvannarath shared these selfies to Facebook, including one wearing a skull mask, right, online . Over the past week, blogs and a Facebook profile linked to Souvannarath have emerged. They feature images of death, Nazism and the chilling phrase: 'Valentine's Day It's going down.' College Professor Charles Aukema has also spoken of her former student. 'She knew how to put together a sentence and she had a command of detail. Sometimes, it was pretty sick detail,' Ms Aukema, who taught Souvannarath in 2012, told the Chicago Tribune. 'It's like a method actor trying to get into the mindset of a killer and then becomes a serial killer. I thought she was quite an introvert. It just seemed like she had no friends whatsoever.' Souvannarath and Shepherd will appear back in court on March 6.","James Gamble, 19, committed suicide as armed officers surrounded home in Halifax, Nova Scotia, last Friday following tip-off about 'massacre plot'

"Keira Knightley may be six months pregnant but there will be no slackening in pace as she sashays up the red carpet at the Oscars tomorrow. Make-up can hide any exhaustion after all. For the young British star, nominated as Best Actress for her role in The Imitation Game, the war-time movie about the Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing, it will be the last leg of a marathon of pre-award parties, post-award parties, talk show appearances and discussion events to promote the film. It is a schedule that has prompted concern from a midwife and left her looking tired. Like countless other Oscars contenders, Knightley has learnt that there is no such thing as a night off when you are campaigning for a Harvey Weinstein film. Hollywood’s most famous and most influential producer was not nicknamed The Punisher for nothing. Scroll down for video . Hungry for success: Harvey Weinstein with Keira Knightley, who has been nominated for an Oscar . If Knightley does win, his name is sure to spring quickly to her lips as she rolls out the thank-yous in her acceptance speech. This is the Hollywood power broker the stars offend at their peril. Weinstein is a regular fixture on Oscars night, occasionally seen clutching a statuette or grinning magnanimously as a winner announces it could not have happened without him. He has been thanked 24 times in Oscars speeches, more times than anyone, including God (Meryl Streep actually called him ‘God’ when she won a Golden Globe). Weinstein and his brother Bob have had more than 300 Oscar nominations for their films. Weinstein is credited (particularly by himself) with spotting the movies that other studios would not touch – Shakespeare In Love, Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, The King’s Speech and The Artist – and making them into critically acclaimed box office hits. He has championed the film careers of Gwyneth Paltrow, Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman and Keira Knightley, not to mention the violence-obsessed director Quentin Tarantino. Now he has his eyes on Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry’s ex who, he says, is a ‘fantastic’ actress (he produced her debut film Tulip Fever, released later this year). In the flesh, of which there is a lot, the man known in Hollywood simply as ‘Harvey’ does not quite match the mannered period charm of his British films or the rarefied thespians he puts in them. Icons: Weinstein has championed the film careers of Gwyneth Paltrow, pictured together, Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman and Keira Knightley . A bear of a man, he has a temper to match. Although friends insist he has calmed down with age and the humbling experience of seeing his career nosedive after an ignominious split from Disney empire a decade ago, Weinstein still clearly terrifies most people in his industry. He has been accused of trying to throttle one film executive and it is claimed he once put a reporter in a headlock. This is not quite the behaviour one might expect of an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire but the American was indeed awarded that honour for services to British film. The 62-year-old son of a diamond cutter from suburban New York is admired, feared and loathed in equal measure in Hollywood but, as well as his reputation as the industry’s biggest bully, he is revered as a man with an unmatched skill in nurturing small independent films. While the main studios rely on relentless comic book adventures and sequels and dull rom-coms, he is one of the few people who can raise money to make interesting movies. During the current awards season, Weinstein has been in his element. Winning is worth more than just a gold statuette – The King’s Speech (with Colin Firth as George VI) was originally expected to earn about $15 million but made $400 million after its triumph at the Academy Awards in 2011. What’s more, it seems that no Oscars campaign stunt is too cynical for Weinstein. This year, he was up to his old tricks, highlighting the The Imitation Game’s gay rights relevance; codebreaker Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) was imprisoned over his homosexuality. The film had been lambasted by critics for being anti-gay in wrongly suggesting Turing became a traitor in order to keep his sexuality secret but in a bravura PR gesture, Weinstein offered to return his CBE if it could be given posthumously to Turing and then called on the Oscars Academy to support gay rights and vote for his film. Weinstein has spent millions promoting movies in the weeks before the Oscars. In 1999, he was said to have spent more on pushing Shakespeare In Love than most studios spend actually making a movie. Such huge spending makes a mockery of the idea that films are judged on their merits. Weinstein uses every trick to get attention: star-laden screenings, cold-calling the Academy’s 6,000-plus voters (a variety of professionals within the industry) and holding lavish parties, such as the one hosted by Mick Jagger and Jennifer Lopez after The King’s Speech was nominated. Last year, Weinstein concentrated his efforts on his film Philomena (the story about a young Irish girl who became pregnant out of wedlock and was sent to a convent). One of Weinstein’s biggest coups was getting the Pope to agree to meet the woman who inspired the film, together with Steve Coogan, its co-writer and star. Hollywood heavyweights: Weinstein (right) and his brother Bob (left) have had more than 300 Oscar nominations for their films. Harvey has been thanked 24 times in Oscar speeches, more times than anyone . Weinstein’s schemes can get him in trouble. When Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan was unexpectedly beaten for Best Film in 1999 by Weinstein’s Shakespeare In Love, a furious Spielberg said that Weinstein had planted press stories challenging the historical accuracy of Saving Private Ryan. In 2001, he was accused of starting a whispering campaign against another Oscars rival, A Beautiful Mind (the biopic about a maths genius called John Nash who won a Nobel prize for Economics). Weinstein, it was widely claimed, spread a rumour that Nash was antisemitic. Weinstein is said to have been furious when his plotting was exposed and blamed a female studio executive, yelling: ‘You’re going to go down for this!’ Weinstein denies the claims. Even after this embarrassment, however, he seems not to have reformed his ways. When the acclaimed director Julie Taymor made a film about the painter Frida Kahlo for Weinstein’s company, Miramax Pictures, Harvey was unimpressed. They watched it at a cinema test screening and he lost his temper with Taymor and some of her team. Winner: In 1999, Weinstein was said to have spent more on pushing Shakespeare In Love than most studios spend making a movie. Above, Weinstein (third from left) with the film's producers and Gwyneth Paltrow . Moving menacingly close to Taymor’s boyfriend, Elliot Goldenthal, Weinstein is said to have yelled at him: ‘Why don’t you defend her so I can beat the s**t out of you!’ Weinstein denied the threats, saying he was ‘rude and impolite’. Weinstein says he gets upset only because he is so passionate about films. Brutality in the film industry simply means honesty, he claims. Film executive Jonathan Taplin said Weinstein tried to strangle him in a restaurant after Taplin sold the film Shine, about the troubled pianist David Helfgott, to another studio. Passionate: Brutality in the film industry simply means honesty, Weinstein, pictured, claims . ‘He was totally out of control and had to be thrown out of the restaurant,’ said Taplin. ‘It was very unpleasant to have this guy strangle you in a restaurant but I give him credit for being passionate enough about Shine to hunt me down and confront me.’ Weinstein denies it. It is also claimed that Weinstein dragged a newspaper reporter out of a party in a headlock boasting he was the ‘****ing sheriff’. Again, he disputes the story. An unabashed Anglophile, Weinstein is married to Georgina Chapman, the British fashion designer and co-founder of the expensive label Marchesa. His friends include Paul McCartney and Bill Clinton while Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile financier with links to Prince Andrew, is said to be an ‘acquaintance’. Oscar-winning director James Ivory once described him as a victim of ‘arrested adolescence... a bully who feels that if he screams and yells and punishes you enough, he is going get his way’. Weinstein’s brutal reputation became the talk of Hollywood in 2008 when he tried to speed up the release of his film, The Reader, in time for the awards season. It was claimed he had badgered one of the film’s producers, Sydney Pollack, on his deathbed, and hassled the widow of Anthony Minghella, the other producer, who had recently died. Weinstein insisted the story was untrue until an email emerged which proved it was. Weinstein’s reputation as a savage slasher of films in the cutting room if he regards them as too long or too slow, has earned him the nickname Harvey Scissorhands. Hayao Miyazaki, the Oscar-winning Japanese cartoon director, was so incensed by Weinstein’s tinkering with one of his films that he sent him a samurai sword with the ominous message: ‘No Cuts!’. To his stars, though, Weinstein is charming and avuncular. ‘He looks out for me,’ said Gwyneth Paltrow. When Jude Law’s wife went into labour during filming, Weinstein arranged for a plane to fly her back to Britain and paid the cast and crew for four days while they waited for Law to get back on set. No wonder actors fall over themselves to praise Weinstein from the Oscars podium; it is better to be pampered by The Punisher than risk being on his wrong side.","Keira Knightley is nominated for her role in Weinstein's The Imitation Game .

"A Kansas man who fell sick after a tick bite and died 11 days later was killed by a newly discovered virus that has never before been seen in America. The man, who was previously healthy and in his 50s, became ill after receiving a tick bite while doing work on his property outdoors. Although he was treated with antibiotics, his organs eventually failed and he lost the ability to breathe on his own. Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the man's blood and found he had been infected by a previously unidentified virus that belonged to the thogotoviruses group, which had never before caused human illness in the U.S. Scroll down for video . A Kansas man who fell sick after a tick bite and died 11 days later was killed by the newly discovered 'Bourbon' virus, which has never before been seen in America . The CDC has named the virus 'Bourbon', after the man's county, according to USA Today. Before the Kansas man, there had only been eight incidents in which a strain of the thogotovirus had caused symptoms in humans - and they all occurred in Europe, Asia or Africa. This is the first time the CDC has seen a thogotovirus affect blood cells. When he was initially tested, the Kansas man's symptoms were similar to a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks. His white blood cells and platelets, which respectively fight infections and help the blood clot, were in decline. In contrast, thogotoviruses are known to cause meningitis. According to CDC epidemiologist J. Erin Staples, the Bourbon virus could have been around for years and just gone unnoticed because symptoms in other people were too mild. Or the virus may have recently evolved to become more deadly. Amesh Adalja, senior associate at the Center for Health Security of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said health officials must now determine just how widespread the Bourbon virus is in ticks, animals and humans so that they can 'grasp the spectrum of illness it is capable of causing'. 'It is only by leaving no stone unturned when investigating unexplained illnesses that humans can best prepare for microbial threats,' he said. The man died at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The CDC said the Bourbon virus belongs to the thogotovirus group, which has previously been known to cause symptoms in only eight other people in Europe, Asia and Africa.","Man was previously healthy before falling ill after a tick bite and dying 11 days later after organ failure .

"An ax wielding teen was left crying for his mother when he tried to rob a convenience store and came away with a face full of mace.

But suspect Giovanni Davenport as blasted with pepper spray when he tried to use an ax to rob a convenience store . Store clerk Ali Ait Mahdi said he reacted to a life threatening situation . But suspect Giovanni Davenport didn't heed the warning, instead swinging the ax into the store's counter. Ali began to blast pepper spray into the boy's face. 'I really sprayed him in the eyes very well,' Ali told KFOR. 'That’s when he lost control and started running toward the door.' By the time he got outside, Davenport was 'crying… throwing up… and calling for his momma,' according to the police report. Ali was not softened by the reaction. 'I heard that he was crying for his mom, but you know we all have parents and we all have problems, but some of us wake up at 6 a.m. to go to work, and some of us wake up at 1 in the afternoon to rob somebody else. That’s life,' he said. Two FBI agents happened to be at the scene and witness the attempted robbery . Even more bad news for Davenport, he stumbled out right into two FBI agents who'd seen the attempted robbery. Ali followed Davenport out to see an FBI agent pointing a gun at the wannabe robber. Authorities say the best practice is not to fight back during a robbery, as it's lucky only the counter was cut. 'The bottom line is we’re thankful he was not hurt,' said Oklahoma City police Sgt. Jennifer Wardlow. 'We always encourage victims to comply. We want to see them get out alive.' Davenport was taken to jail and charged with robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. 'Situations like that, you fight for yourself for your life,' Ali said. 'It’s instinct.'","Store clerk Ali Ait Mahdi said he defended himself when faced with an ax and a demand for money .

The crowd screamed and cheered as the Pope stopped to greet his followers, with some women bursting into tears . More than a thousand people gathered to hear the Pope speak about the Mafia in southern Italy . The head of the Catholic Church then made his way on to the stage, from where he gave a powerful speech urging members of the Mafia to repent. The Pope was speaking during an audience for pilgrims and anti-crime activists from the southern region of Calabria, home to the 'Ndrangheta - mainland Italy's equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia. He said the Church would welcome them in if they promised to put their criminal lives behind them. 'Open your hearts to the Lord. The Lord is waiting for you and the Church will welcome you if your willingness to serve good is as clear and public as your choice to serve evil was,' Pope Francis said. When he visited Calabria last June, he accused organised crime groups of practising 'the adoration of evil'.

The 'Ndrangheta, which makes most of its money from drug trafficking, is spread over 30 countries. The group is said to have an annual revenue of £44billion - equivalent to about 3.5 per cent of Italy's total economic output. The Pope also met German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Vatican today, where the two heads of state discussed the conflict in Ukraine and the fight against poverty. The meeting, which was the second between the two since Francis' election as Pope in 2013, was described as 'very cordial'. Chancellor Merkel also met the Pope today as they met to discuss the conflict in Ukraine among other issues . Something funny? The heads of state laugh as they chat during their meeting at the Vatican today . Francis presented Merkel with a medallion depicting Saint Martin giving his coat to the needy, saying it served as a reminder to world leaders that their job is 'to protect their poor.' Merkel responded: 'We try to do our best.' He also gave her a copy of his teachings Evangelii gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel), translated into German. Merkel gave the pope an envelope containing a donation to help children fleeing conflicts in the Middle East. She also presented the Pontiff with a collection of music by Johann Sebastian Bach. She told reporters that their discussions were ''wide-ranging, as expected,' covering Ukraine, poverty, the role of women in developing countries and gender equality. 'I was very happy to meet with the pope. He gave me a lot of encouragement,' she added.","Crowds screamed and cheered as the Pope arrives for a speech at Vatican .

"A personalised suit worn by India's Prime Minister when he met U.S. President Barack Obama has sold a staggering £450,000 at auction. Narendra Modi's dark suit with its unique monogram pinstripes, which vertically spell out his name, was sold to diamond merchant Lalji Patel. The bespoke wool suit sparked a bidding war, but the businessman, who like the Prime Minister is from Gujarat state, made the winning bid of 43 million rupees (£450,000). The money will be used to clean up the heavily polluted Ganges River - a pet project of India's Hindu nationalist prime minister. Bespoke: Modi wore the suit with his monogram in dull gold pinstripes when he met Obama in India last month . Personalised: Narendra Modi's dark suit has unique monogram pinstripes, which vertically spell out his name . Modi wore the suit with his monogram in dull gold pinstripes when he met Obama in India last month. Mr Patel, owner of the Dharmanandan diamond company, said he had wanted to do something for his country. 'Buying this suit was all I wanted,' he said. 'It feels good to know that the money will go towards the cleaning of the holy river.' The suit is estimated to have cost more than one million rupees (£10,500), and opposition party lawmakers criticised the Prime Minister for his insensitivity in wearing such an expensive suit in a country where millions live in abject poverty. However, Gujarat official Milind Toravane said the suit and other items being auctioned were gifts received by Modi after he became Prime Minister in May last year. The gifts include decorative pieces in silver and brass. The outfit was among more than 450 lots put up for auction by Modi in the city of Surat in Gujarat. During Modi's 2001 to 2014 stint as chief minister of Gujarat, the gifts he received were regularly auctioned off and the money collected was used to fund programs educating girls in the state.

"An investment firm billionaire claims his wife wanted a clause in their prenuptial agreement allowing her to move their three children to New York or San Francisco after a divorce because she found Chicago 'unsophisticated'. During divorce proceedings in Cook County Court in Illinois, it was revealed that Anne Dias, 44, claims Ken Griffin, 45, was so upset by their pre-nup argument that he removed a post from their bed and threw it at her. Yesterday Griffin, the founder and chief executive of $20billion Chicago hedge fund Citadel, denied throwing the bedpost during the 2003 argument after he 'inadvertently' removed it, . Scroll down for video . Ken Griffin (left) filed for divorce from his wife, Anne Dias (right), last year in Cook County Court in Illinois . Griffin claims Dias wanted to be able to move their children to the coasts because Chicago is 'unsophisticated' Dias claims Griffin threw a bedpost at her after they argued about the Chicago (pictured) clause in their pre-nup . The argument about the Chicago clause happened days before the couple's lavish marriage ceremony in Versailles, France, the Chicago Tribune reported. Griffin said in his filing: 'Anne surfaced with a demand that the premarital agreement contain a provision permitting her, in the event of divorce, to take any children from Chicago and move them to either San Francisco or New York. 'She claimed she wanted this because she did not want to continue living in Chicago, which she considered to be unsophisticated.' After Griffin balked at the demand, an argument ensued. The couple married at Versailles in France (above) with performances by Cirque du Soleil and Donna Summer . In an earlier filing, Dias said Griffin 'intimidated her by pulling one of the bed posts off its socket in their bedroom and throwing it violently towards her.' She claims he screamed at her and she 'felt threatened and was fearful for her safety'. Griffin refuted those claims in the filing yesterday. He claims he 'inadvertently removed a bedpost from the bed, which resulted in a moment of levity ending the argument. 'Anne did not leave the room during the argument, and the parties slept in the very same bed together that night and for years thereafter. 'All of these allegations are completely false and intended to tarnish Ken's reputation.' Griffin has been living in a $15 million penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago during the proceedings . A spokesperson for Dias criticized Griffin for his filing yesterday, the Chicago Sun Times reported. The spokesperson said: 'Ken Griffin, one of the wealthiest men in the world, continues to lie with impunity and to brutally and shamelessly attack the mother of his children in an effort to avoid his financial responsibilities to his family. 'Anne is saddened that he is using his enormous resources in an attempt to destroy her when it would be so easy for him to support his children as he always did during the marriage.' Griffin filed for divorce from Dias last year. They had been married for 11 years and their children are aged two, four and six. Griffin, who is estimated to be worth more than $5billion, is seeking joint custody. Dias, who has already secured more than $35million in the divorce, wants the children to herself. She is asking the court to throw out their prenuptial agreement and is demanding about $1million a month for 'child-related expenses'. The couple separated in February 2012.","Ken Griffin, 45, CEO of $20 billion Chicago investment firm Citadel, filed for divorce from his wife of 11 years, Anne Dias, 44, last year .

"At least 20 people have died as a result of plummeting temperatures caused by the 'Siberian Express' sweeping across the United States. Nine people in Tennessee, six in Pennsylvania, two in Illinois and one each in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky have succumbed to hypothermia during the arctic blast which forecasters say will continue for most of next week. Another widespread round of ice, snow or freezing rain is set to start falling Saturday from Missouri to the mid-Atlantic and as far south as Alabama and Georgia - sending temperatures to their lowest point since the mid-1990s. Bruce Sullivan, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said: 'Higher amounts over the next two days will probably be across southern Indiana and Illinois and eastward through Ohio into western Pennsylvania. That's where it looks like the jackpot will be.'

At least 20 people across the country have died as a result of the arctic blast caused by the 'Siberian Express' Ray Abey views ice flowing on the Delaware River at Pleasant Hill Park in Philadelphia. The National Weather Service says the newest band of Arctic air could plunge parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic into deep freezes that haven't been felt since the mid-1990s . Nick Wiltgen, a senior meterologist for Weather.com, said: 'This week ranks among the most intense arctic outbreaks so far in the 21st century for the eastern U.S., and it is certainly one of the most impressively cold air masses we've seen this late in the winter season, coming only a month before the spring equinox.' The weather system is called a Siberian Express because the winds are coming from Russia, traveling over the Arctic Circle and pushing into Canada and the United States. Sullivan added: 'We can almost show the trajectory from Siberia all the way to the U.S.' Bitter cold temperatures have shattered at least 500 decades-old records from Cincinnati to Washington to New York. The National Weather Service said the low Friday got down to six degrees at Reagan National Airport, just across the Potomac River from Washington. At Baltimore's airport, the temperature dipped to a record low two degrees. In western Pennsylvania, temperatures dipped to minus 18 in New Castle, minus 15 in Butler and 6 below zero in Pittsburgh - all records.

Huntsville and the rest of the state's northeastern corner is under a winter storm warning through early Saturday, and forecasters say much of northern Alabama and Georgia could get snow and sleet, including metro Atlanta. The deep freeze transformed Niagara Falls into an icy spectacle, encasing the trees around it into crystal shells and drawing tourists who are braving below-zero temperatures. The Niagara River is flowing below the ice cover, so the falls aren't completely frozen. But days of subzero temperatures have created a thick coating of ice and snow on every surface near the falls, including railings, trees and boulders. The massive ice buildup has become a tourist magnet. Residents in Toronto are still mourning the death of three-year-old Elijah Marsh who wandered out into the extreme cold in no clothes and died. More than $100,000 has already been raised in donations for his funeral.

"Fearless: Celebrity chef Annabel Karmel has a spine of steel and the coolest of heads in a crisis . Annabel Karmel, celebrity chef, author and businesswoman, doesn’t look like the sort of person you’d immediately turn to for help if you found yourself in a tight corner. She is 51, petite — a little over 5ft tall — fine-boned and glamorous, her blonde hair cascading in a tumble of luxuriant curls. She’s a doll-like size six, wears a floral pinny and pads round her elegant £20 million town house in North London in bare feet, her dainty toenails painted vermillion. She looks as if a gust of wind would blow her over. But appearances are deceptive: Annabel has a spine of steel, the tenacity of a terrier and the coolest of heads in a crisis. Last summer, she was robbed by a gang of muggers. They pounced after she parked her car in a quiet side street to go shopping, held her in an arm-lock and wrenched her £12,000 Rolex watch from her wrist, then snatched her shopping bag from the boot of her car. While such an ordeal would have reduced most of us to quivering wrecks, Annabel, a divorced mum-of-three, had the presence of mind to note the registration number of one of the gang’s getaway mopeds. She handed it to the police at the crime scene. The thugs, who had by then terrorised and robbed a string of affluent victims in the wealthy Hampstead area of north London — including a 70-year-old man who they hit with a hammer — were swiftly identified. Within a couple of weeks they were arrested and charged. Their violent three-month crime spree abruptly curtailed, the trio — Corrie Moroney, 23, Alan Fitzgerald, 20 and Ellis Parkinson, 21 — were this week jailed for a total of 23 years. Does Annabel now live in fear? ‘You can’t!’ she exclaims. ‘Otherwise, the muggers have won. They’ve got away with it. I won’t become a prisoner in my own home because of them. ‘I won’t pretend I’m not wary. I don’t wear an expensive watch any more. And I make sure I’ve got my house keys in my hand before I get out of my car as thieves often strike when people are standing on their own doorsteps. ‘I don’t take unnecessary risks. But I’m resilient. And, actually, I feel rather lucky. They could have hit me with the hammer.’ But the fact is, Annabel seems to be rather more unlucky than most: two years ago, she was forced to track down her beloved Samoyed, Hamilton, when he was dognapped by a gang. She says: ‘I plastered posters, offering a reward for his safe return, all over London. So when a woman rang — she said she’d seen my poster, and although she was cagey and vague, she said she might be able to help — I went off on my own to meet her. ‘I suppose it seems reckless, but I was prepared to take a risk to get him back. ‘She lived on a council estate in north London. It was the sort of place you wouldn’t want to be alone in after dark, but I don’t remember feeling trepidation. I just wanted my dog back. Unlucky: Two years ago, Annabel was forced to track down her beloved Samoyed, Hamilton, pictured, when he was dognapped by a gang. She found him filthy and almost unrecognisable at a flat in north London . ‘I knocked on the door, went into the flat and there was Hamilton, filthy and almost unrecognisable. There was a split second’s delay before he leapt into my arms. We’d been apart for ten days and he was mad with joy.’ The woman who was harbouring Annabel’s beloved dog claimed, improbably, he had been ‘dumped’ on her doorstep. Police, it later emerged, found she had links with an armed robber, a member of the gang they believed was responsible for snatching him, along with 11 other pedigrees, all ransomed for ‘reward’ money. There was insufficient evidence to charge them; even so, Annabel felt she had won a small victory. With the muggers, however, the evidence she provided was enough to convict them. It happened on June 30 last year when she was nearing home. ‘It was a warm day, 5pm and broad daylight, and I wasn’t wearing anything ostentatious,’ says Annabel. ‘I parked my Mercedes in a side street to do some shopping — no one was around — and went to the boot to get a bag out. Just then, three men on mopeds sped up out of nowhere. One had a hammer and their faces were obscured by helmets and scarves. There was no time to feel scared. ‘They cornered me. I couldn’t run. One of them shouted: “Give us the watch,” but I couldn’t give it to them. I just froze. They’d pinioned me by my arms, wrenched the watch off, making my wrist bleed. ‘Then they took my striped canvas bag from the boot. I told them it was empty, but I think they thought my purse was in it. ‘Then I heard raised voices from people across the road: “Leave her alone!” For a second, the gang loitered and it was then that I took down the number plate. Then they sped off and it was over. ‘All I felt was relief: that I wasn’t hurt and all they’d taken were things which were replaceable.’ Thugs: Annabel was robbed by muggers Corrie Moroney (left), 23, Alan Fitzgerald (centre), 20 and Ellis Parkinson (right), 21 - who were this week jailed for a total of 23 years - as she parked in a quiet side street . The police, summoned by passers-by, arrived within five minutes. ‘They tracked the gang in a helicopter and just over an hour later came back to me with a photo of my canvas bag under the seat of one of the mopeds. I was amazed how quick they were.’ The bag and registration number Annabel took were vital evidence that helped persuade the gang to plead guilty to 12 robberies at Blackfriars Crown Court this week. Annabel, who chose not to attend court, feels their sentences — 11 years for ringleader Moroney, eight for Parkinson and four for accomplice Fitzgerald — were just. She’s been told one of the men has since expressed his repentance in a letter that will be sent to her soon. ‘I’d like to read it,’ she says. ‘I’d even like to visit him in prison. I think I could tell then if his remorse was genuine. Can he really be sorry if he’s mugged 12 people? I’m curious to know.’ Successful: Annabel's business is worth £10million . Annabel’s no-nonsense attitude has been shaped by her upbringing and by life’s events. Born in 1962, she was raised by prosperous parents in Marble Arch, central London, attending the prestigious St Paul’s School for Girls. Her father, Gordon, owned a manufacturing business, making shoe soles. But the family’s prosperity ended when the business failed. Annabel’s mother, Evelyn, an architect, assumed the role of bread-winner, instilling in her daughter the values of self-sufficiency and hard work. But her first career as a harpist — she trained at the Royal College of Music — ended after a terrible family tragedy. In 1985, Annabel married oil broker Simon Karmel and two years later a daughter, Natasha, arrived. Just 13 weeks later, she died of encephalitis. It is the defining tragedy of Annabel’s life and the reason she gives short shrift to muggers and dognappers. Nothing could hurt her more than that loss. ‘Natasha’s hands were twitching involuntarily,’ she remembers of that dreadful day the illness first took hold. ‘She was projectile vomiting. I called the doctor who was quite dismissive. I felt embarrassed that I was being an over-protective first-time mum. ‘But the next morning Natasha was no better. I took her to hospital. She had a scan. I held her in my arms for four-and-a-half hours, and then she died. That is the most devastating loss a mother can bear. ‘I stopped playing the harp. Music seemed superficial. I re-evaluated my life. I knew the only way to deal with the grief was to have another child.’ Three more children followed — Nicholas, 26, Lara, 25 and Scarlett, 22 — and Annabel built a career round her family. She began to cook for her children and published a book of recipes to great acclaim. More books followed, and today her business is worth £10million. ‘Cooking became my therapy, my route through grief,’ she explains. ‘The books, the cooking ... they will be my legacy, because what you do for others lives on. What you do for yourself dies with you.’ Eight years ago, she and Simon were divorced — they remain amicable — and now shares her home with her partner, Stephen Margolis, a former film producer. Natasha’s death puts everything into perspective. When in June 2013 Annabel sacked an employee, Mark Salter (then her sales director), his retaliation was vicious: he accused her of sexually harassing him. She spent £60,000 on legal fees, fighting to clear her name. Last summer she was vindicated — on the morning the case was due in court, Salter, 39, retracted his allegation. ‘I wouldn’t be bullied,’ she says. ‘I stood up for what was right and I put up a good fight.’ No doubt, those three muggers now languishing in jail would wholeheartedly agree. After building her business from scratch at the kitchen table, Annabel believes that having children doesn't mean a full stop at the end of your CV. She is now helping equip other mums with the confidence and power to start-up their own businesses with her new book, Mumpreneur. Mumpreneur, by Annabel Karmel (published by Vermillion), is out now.

"The 17-year-old boy whose 'laser cat' yearbook photo made national headlines has committed suicide. Draven Rodriguez became an internet sensation last September after he posed for photos in a suit, clutching his cat Mr Bigglesworth, both surrounded by laser beams. In an online petition that gained national support, he appealed to his school in Schenectady, New York, to publish the unconventional images in the yearbook - and was ultimately successful. On Thursday night, he took his own life at home, his parents told The Times Union. Loved: Draven Rodriguez, 17, inspired a wave of interest and excitement when he posed for this photo with his cat Mr Bigglesworth and a background of lasers. He petitioned for the image to be in his yearbook . Relatives and friends have paid tribute to Draven's empathy, compassion, and determination to complete anything he set his mind to. A senior at Schenectady High School, he taught himself to play guitar, rowed boats, and learned to speak basic Russian. His cat-and-laser photo, which earned mentions on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show and The Ellen Show, was an indication of his sense of humor, his stepfather Jonathan Stewart said. 'He wasn't trying to stir things up with it. He honestly just wanted a silly photo because he had a great sense of humor.' At first, the school objected to Draven's request and refused to put his photo in the portrait section. Eventually, after his plea swept the internet, he was allowed to share the school principal's page - and share the laser photo with her and her chihuahua Vivienne. Made it: The school principal Diane Wilkinson agreed to the photo if she and dog Vivienne could be in it . Tragic: Draven's parents said he took his own life at home in Schenectady, New York, on Thursday night . Inspiring: His stepfather Jonathan Stewart said Draven had empathy for people and made friends easily . Photographer Vincent Giordano described Vivienne as a nervous model while Mr Bigglesworth was more interested in the technical aspects. 'Diane and Draven were all laughs, they really enjoyed the photo session,' he told Buzzfeed. 'Vivienne and Mr Bigglesworth really broke the rules of cats and dogs and got along famously for a trouble free photo session!' During the debacle, Draven told the Daily Gazette: 'I don’t want to go in the yearbook with the generic ""I-look-like-everyone-else"" photo. I wanted a ""He looks great, only he would try that"" photo. When people look at it, they will know that was me.' He was the first to admit the original image was over the top, which was the point to begin with. He always wanted to have fun and was constantly trying new activities such as rowing and reading Russian . 'I'm a little out there, and a little tongue-in-cheek,' he said. 'Cats and laser....sarcastic. It's so outlandish and ridiculous. 'I'm not trying to make any statement other than my photo is ridiculous and this is how I am.' His stepfather said the episode was a glimpse into Draven's inspiring character. 'He made friends wherever he went,' Stewart said. 'He had friends all over the country - people he'd met at youth-leadership conferences, online, just around town... He had an empathy for the world and for other people that I think is rare in kids his age. It was wonderful to see.' Draven is survived by his stepfather, his mother Melissa Petersen-Stewart, his 11-year-old sister Lily Stewart, and his father Eric Rodriguez.","Draven Rodriguez, 17, took own life at home in Schenectady on Thursday .

Miss Watson met Prince William last year during a dinner to celebrate the work of the Royal Marsden . According to Woman's Day, Harry, 30, asked the Harry Potter star out after hearing she had broken up with previous boyfriend Matthew Janney in December last year. Apparently, Miss Watson met with the prince with a group of 12 friends and they have been meeting up in secret since. The 'insider' apparently told the magazine: 'Harry didn't want her to feel like she was put on the spot,” explains one insider. “A party also shows he’s fun and not stuffy.' 'He’s smitten – and it’s more than Emma’s looks.' The rumour was met with a predictable flood of Harry Potter jokes. One Twitter wag said: 'Emma Watson is dating Prince Harry! Despite JK Rowling's best efforts, Hermione is finally hooking up with Harry!' Another said: 'I hope Prince Harry and Emma Watson last because if they have a son, it will be the half-blood prince.' While Miss Watson, 24, and the Prince have not been pictured together before, she has already met his brother the Duke of Cambridge, as well as Prince Charles. Prince Harry broke up with Cressida Bonas in April last year after a two-year on-off relationship ended amicably. The Prince was introduced to her by Princess Eugenie in 2012, with the couple's last public outing together coming at an England rugby match a month before they split. Before that, Harry dated Chelsy Davy, with the pair breaking up in 2010 after a turbulent six-year relationship. Prince Harry's last girlfriend was Cressida Bonas, with the pair splitting up 'amicably' last April . Miss Bonas and Prince Harry, pictured at a rugby match last March, were together for around two years . Prince Harry's first serious relationship was with Chelsy Davy, who he dated on-off for about six years . After suggestions that the pair were set to get back together emerged in 2011, Prince Harry said her was '100 per cent single'. Despite this, Miss Davy was invited to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April that year. Miss Watson - who played Hermione in the Harry Potter series - broke up with Oxford University rugby player Matthew Janney in December. The couple, who dated for a year, went their separate ways due to Emma's unrelenting work schedule but said they were determined to remain friends. Break-up: Emma Watson split from Oxford University rugby player Matthew Janney in December . Over: The pair said they would remain friends after their break-up just before Christmas last year . Miss Watson dated Will Adamowicz for two years and was pictured embracing him at Coachella Music festival in 2012 . The Perks of Being a Wallflower star's relationship with Mr Janney came not long after her split from long-term boyfriend Will Adamowicz. Miss Watson, who is now a UN Goodwill Ambassador, met Mr Adamowicz in his first year at Oxford, where she studied for a year as a visiting student. While the couple did their best to stay out of the public eye, they were seen embracing at Coachella music festival in 2012 and he joined her at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards.

"A year after 17-year-old Kyle Coleman mysteriously vanished after a hunting trip with a friend in outback Queensland his family are no closer to finding out what happened to him. The baffling case was made even more tragic by the suicide of the Mount Isa teen's best mate days after they returned from the expedition on February 22 last year.

"The richest fight in history is officially on after Floyd Mayweather posted a signed copy of his contract with Manny Pacquiao on social media on Friday night, setting in motion the formal countdown to a $250million (£160m) blockbuster on May 2. A fight that has been five years in the making will be staged at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, pitting Mayweather's hyped unbeaten record against one of the most effective, exciting punchers of their generation. Feuds have dominated every stage of the stuttering discussions over the past years, with arguments over drug testing and financial splits. Floyd Mayweather has  confirmed he will face Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 . Mayweather shared the official signed contract for the fight via his Shots social media account on Friday . AS SPORTSMAIL REVEALED: Click here to read how Jeff Powell told when the big fight would be announced . Set to be the richest fight in boxing history, the purse is expected to start at $250m (£160m) - with Mayweather guaranteed a minimum $150m (£96m) and Pacquiao's share at least $100m (£64m). With Mayweather understood to have commanded the 60-40 split of the purse, the fight will occur – with an autumn rematch clause believed to have been written into the deal by Mayweather. The 37-year-old is understood to have been the dominant figure throughout negotiations – right up to getting his wish to announce the fight, which he did via Shots.com - a social media site in which he has a stake in. Mayweather's name will be first for the billing of the fight ('Mayweather-Pacquiao'), according to SI, while he will be introduced and walk to the ring second. He posted the contract  along with the comment: 'What the world has been waiting for has arrived. Mayweather vs. Pacquiao on May 2, 2015, is a done deal. I promised the fans we would get this done, and we did. We will make history on May 2nd. Don't miss it! This is the signed contract from both fighters.' The fight will be a joint pay-per-view event shown on Showtime, the channel Mayweather is contracted to, and HBO who have the deal to show Pacquiao's fights. While there could also be a battle in the UK were BT Sport to challenge Sky Sports. According to reports, every room in the MGM Grand sold out within three minutes of the fight being announced. Mayweather and Pacquiao spoke and swapped numbers during a Miami Heat basketball game  in January . Pacquiao and Mayweather were pictured together for the first time at the basketball game last month . Mayweather is understood to have been the dominant figure throughout negotiations for the  mega-fight . Miami Heat projected the two fighters onto the big screen and asked the question: 'Coming in 2015?' Mayweather, the WBA and WBC welterweight world champion, and winner of all of his 47 fights, said: 'I am glad my decision to meet with Manny and discuss making this fight happen helped get the deal done,' said Mayweather. 'Giving the fans what they want to see is always my main focus. This will be the biggest event in the history of the sport. Boxing fans and sports fans around the world will witness greatness on May 2. I am the best ever, TBE, and this fight will be another opportunity to showcase my skills and do what I do best, which is win. 'Manny is going to try to do what 47 before him failed to do, but he won't be successful. He will be number 48.' Three titles will be on the line on May 2 and Pacquiao, the WBO champion who has been defeated five times in 64 fights, said: 'I am very happy that Floyd Mayweather and I can give the fans the fight they have wanted for so many years. 'They have waited long enough and they deserve it. It is an honour to be part of this historic event. I dedicate this fight to all the fans who willed this fight to happen and, as always, to bring glory to the Philippines and my fellow Filipinos around the world.' Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach said: 'Floyd should enjoy being the A-side while he can because on May 2, Manny is going to put him on his backside.' Mayweather was at the NBA All-Star event last weekend as the world waited for him to announce his fight . Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in the pair's rematch last September in Las Vegas . Mayweather twice beat Argentinian fighter Maidana in 2014 - winning both bouts on points . Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November . Pacquiao, from the Philippines, looked in imperious form as he comfortably beat  Algieri in  China . Jim Lampley is set to front the broadcasting team on HBO. The face of HBO boxing has criticised Mayweather in recent years, and his involvement was reportedly a point of contention for his team during the negotiations. The pair, who both beat Ricky Hatton before the Mancunian retired, have long been considered the two best fighters of their generation and boxing fans have been itching for them to get in the ring for years. This saga, which has frustrated fans as much as it has begged a question of how the sport's organisational make-up could fail to enforce such a fight, had come close to fruition in 2010. That is when contracts were drawn before the fight collapsed because Pacquiao refused to give blood and urine samples at random right up until the day of the event. Mayweather beat British fighter Ricky Hatton in 2007 with the fight stopped in the 10th round . Pacquiao also beat Hatton when the pair fought in 2009 with a brutal second round knock-out . His argument was that giving blood so close to his 2005 fight with Erik Morales had caused his defeat. The bitter fallout and Mayweather's apparent insinuations about Pacquiao's refusal to submit to the USADA testing led to the latter taking legal action. Since then, the hopes have peaked and faded but with no meaningful action. But after the fighters met face-to-face last month at a basketball match in Miami, talks escalated quickly. Multiple times each week reports surfaced that the fight had been confirmed, only for a denial to follow, often from Mayweather's camp.","Floyd Mayweather's $250m showdown with Manny Pacquiao is ON .

PPQ's Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parke did Gothic romanticism with a feminine collection nostalgic of the Victorian age . High-collared translucent silk shirts with dramatic frills echoed the romantic theme, and a long draping fur-lined coat lingered more towards 1940s wartime fashion.

Other pieces were modernised in their shapes and short cuts, plunging necklines and sheer fabrics added a touch of sensuality, whilst remaining within the realms of romantic traditionalism. The decadent, sculpted shapes of certain dresses were reminiscent of ballet costume pieces, depicting a softer grace in their simplicity and restraint, whilst still keeping  the Gothic stance intact.

"Her steamy, bestselling novels and strong male characters have seduced hundreds of thousands of female readers worldwide. But Jodi Ellen Malpas has revealed she has split from her own Mr Right – because he no longer lives up to the fantasy she created. The 34-year-old, whose This Man trilogy has sold more than 500,000 copies, has left her husband of ten years after ‘falling in love’ with one of her characters. Scroll down for video . Steamy writer Jodi Ellen Malpas, 34, has split with her husband of 10 years. The author said her marriage was not 'solid enough' to withstand the changes 'success has bought' Ms Malpas, from Northampton, says: ‘All my fictional men are strong, successful, sophisticated and enigmatic. I guess it’s hard for any living, breathing man to live up to such a fantasy. ‘In This Man I created Jesse Ward, whose forceful personality was appealing to me. There is no denying I fell in love with him. ‘After all, I created him and I made him the way he is for a reason. Every woman needs some fantasy lover to spice up the dull reality of her real life. I wanted to create my perfect love story. ‘But the success of my books and the popularity of my male character led to the breakdown of my marriage. Sadly it was not solid enough to withstand the changes success has brought to my life.’ The author's trilogy, This Man, has sold more than 500,000 copies and has led many to believe that Ms Malpas is the new E.L. James, the housewife who wrote Fifty Shades of Grey . The mother of two, whom many believe is the new E. L. James, the housewife who wrote the Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy, became a self-publishing sensation last year, swiftly rising to the top of the New York Times Best Seller List. The This Man trilogy explores the love affair between young interior designer Ava O’Shea and playboy Jesse Ward. The second part of her new trilogy, One Night, has just been published by Orion. ‘I was 23 when Aaron and I got married, so we were both very young,’ she says. ‘I didn’t really know who I was. I got on with being a wife and mother. ‘But over time I started to feel that something was missing – my normal everyday life had become a routine. I was bored. I guess that is what couples mean when they say they’ve grown apart. Aaron couldn’t understand why I wanted to write my fiction and I couldn’t understand why he didn’t understand.’ The couple have two children, Alfie, 14, and Patrick, ten. But although they divorced in August last year, Ms Malpas says their relationship remains amicable. She is currently single and insists that she has no time to get involved in a relationship. ‘My children and my writing are enough for the moment,’ she adds. ‘In any case, I suspect some men might be a little intimidated by my independence and my success.’ And she insists she has no regrets. ‘It’s been crazy, but I’m loving the stronger more liberated me,’ she says.","Author Jodi Ellen Malpas, 34,  has split from her husband of 10 years .

'As I see crisply rendered images of monsters, robots, and cadaver heads in Magic Leap's offices, I can envision someday having a video chat with faraway family members who look as if they're actually sitting in my living room while, on their end, I appear to be sitting in theirs. 'Or walking around New York City with a virtual tour guide, the sides of buildings overlaid with images that reveal how the structures looked in the past.' Magic Leap's Florida-based makers said it is a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, which it calls 'cinematic reality'. The firm's website features an elephant (pictured) moving  realistically in a person's hands . Sensors can track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible. Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select and back . In October, Magic Leap announced it had raised $542 million in funding, led by Google. Other investors included Qualcomm, the world's leading phone chipmaker, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR, and Legendary Entertainment. The patent was filed in July 2014 by chief executive Rony Abovitz, and was awarded earlier this week. In terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles, connected to a battery pack. It connects to a network, which then connects to a so-called 'passable world model.' This model is created using a database of objects and 'object recognisers'. Sensors can also track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible. Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select, back or cancel, and right clicks. In one drawing from the patent, a mother and child are in a supermarket, and a virtual version of their list appears on the trolley. Other drawings show a man watching sport on this TV, with scores, player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him. She says the experience is like 'watching movies where the characters appear to be right in front of me, letting me follow them around as the plot unfolds.' The company appears to be aiming to fit its technology into a chunky pair of sports sunglasses wired to a square pack that users can place in their pocket. But the prototype that Ms Meltz used was fixed on 'unwieldy scaffolding'. The company won't say how it will shrink its device, but chief executive Rony Abovitz has confirmed that the headset will be a glasses-like system. Despite the secrecy surrounding the system, it has been deemed exciting enough for Google to have invested around $500 million. Other investors included Qualcomm, the world's leading phone chipmaker, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR, and Legendary Entertainment. In January, an extensive patent not only showed how the augmented reality headset could look and work, it also provides a number of example uses. The patent was filed in July 2014 by chief executive Rony Abovitz, and was awarded earlier this week. It features a total of 180 pages and drawings detailing the look, functionality and uses for the device. In terms of design, the headset resembles skiing goggles, connected to a battery pack. The headset connects to a network, which then connects to a so-called 'passable world model.' This model is created using a database of objects and 'object recognisers'. Sensors can also track the wearer's location and position, to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible, with the correct depth and proportions. Further into the patent, a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings. One shows a man watching sport on TV, with scores, player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him . An example image, showing the blurring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the technology, is pictured. As part of Google's investment, Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at the search engine, will join Magic Leap's board . Buttons on the visor could act like a 'home screen', to take wearers to menus, for example. While other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus, copy, select, back or cancel, and right clicks. Mr Abovitz said last February that his company's mission was to 'develop and commercialise...the most natural and human-friendly wearable computing interface in the world.' Further into the patent, a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings. In one, a mother and child are in a supermarket, and a virtual version of their shopping list appears on the trolley. Following the same usage case, the headset could turn shopping into a game for the child, in which characters are located in the veg aisle, for example, or monsters jump out from behind tins. In another patent drawing, a mother and child are in a supermarket with a virtual version of their shopping list on the trolley (left). The headset could also turn shopping into a game for the child, in which characters are located in the veg aisle, for example, or monsters jump out from behind tins (right) In hospitals, surgeons could wear the headset during surgeries to locate specific areas of a heart, for example, or follow step-by-step guidelines on a virtual screen (pictured) Other drawings show a man watching sport on his TV, with scores, player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him. The headset could also turn everyday tasks into games, such as chopping a cucumber, seen in another drawing. And, in hospitals, surgeons could wear the headset during surgeries to locate specific areas of a heart, for example, or follow step-by-step guidelines on a virtual screen. As part of Google's investment, Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at the search engine, will join Magic Leap's board. Paul Jacobs, executive chairman of Qualcomm, will join Magic Leap's board as an observer. The headset could also turn everyday tasks into games, such as chopping a cucumber, as illustrated in another patent drawing (pictured). The patent was filed in July 2014 and awarded earlier this week . The soon-to-be defunct Google Glass already lets users see augmented reality. Using a particular app for example, runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them. The Magic Leap patent also shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists, for example (pictured) Mr Abovitz recently said: 'We have the term 'cinematic reality' because we are disassociated with those things. 'When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years. 'To go farther and deeper than we're going, you would be changing what it means to be human.' The soon-to-be defunct Google Glass, already lets users see augmented reality. Using a particular app for example, runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them. The Magic Leap patent shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists, for example. Google Glass also superimposes information on the periphery of a wearer's vision. Facebook spent $2 billion buying Oculus last year, which makes a virtual reality headset, mostly aimed at gamers. Unlike Magic Leap's future device, it blocks out the real world around the user. Gamers hope Facebook and Google's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology, which would make playing games and watching films more realistic, as well as creating other immersive experiences. A release date and price for the Magic Leap headset have not been revealed. Magic Leap's system claims to be more realistic than the Oculus Rift (pictured). The firm was bought last year by Facebook for $2 billion, and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the headset to be launched .

"After three weeks deliberating, a Detroit jury has convicted six members of a nation-wide motorcycle club following a months-long trial that heard from 42 defendants, on charges they ran a violent drug and gambling-based organization that had meth labs all over the country. 'For too many years the Devils Diciples spread fear and violence throughout Michigan and the country,' Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said, according to The Detroit Free Press. 'This outlaw motorcycle gang thrived on intimidation and its ability to avoid prosecution - but no longer.' The jury convicted the 60-year-old leader of the Diciples, Jeff 'Fat Dog' Smith, and five others. Leader: Devils Diciples head Jeff 'Fat Dog' Smith, 60, was found guilty Friday of methamphetamine trafficking, conspiracy to obstruct justice, violent crimes in aid of racketeering and other charges . Smith, of Mount Clemens, was found guilty Friday of all charges, including racketeering conspiracy, illegal gambling and witness tampering. Defense attorney Jerry Sabbota acknowledged that Smith anticipates a long prison sentence, expected to be life. The trial lasted nearly four months in Detroit federal court. The Devils Diciples has about 150 members and was formed in 1967. The headquarters is in  Clinton Township, southeastern Michigan, and Grand Rapids. However there were chapters in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and beyond. The prosecution said the Devils Diciples steamrolled their operation by drug trafficking, stealing and selling motorcycles, gambling, robbery and running meth labs. Would-be members had to see out a probation before being accepted into the club, which required approval from all other members. Once accepted, a member was required to own a Harley Davidson, The Detroit Free Press reported. Convicted: Paul Anthony Darrah, 50 (left), also known as Pauli, the national vice president - who relies on a breathing tank - and and Cary Dale Vandiver, 56 (right), of Alabama, also known as Gun Control, the national warlord for the club, received the same charges as their leader, Jeff Smith . Members were forced to go after and threaten or intimidate people upon request of the club. They also were asked to lie to police, the court records show. A major part of the indictment allegedly occurred inside the Devils Diciples clubhouse in Arizona. A group of members, including Witort, stormed the clubhouse under the belief the chapter had broken some of the key Diciples rules. The victims were tied up with duct tape and assaulted with guns, tasers and knives. They were then put inside a pickup truck, driven into the desert and dumped in a ravine, where they were left to die. The court indictment accused the club of, over the years, committing murder, attempted murder, robbery, extortion, assault and threats of violence, the indictment said. More than 60 firearms and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition were seized during the investigation, and eight methamphetamine labs were dismantled, authorities said. Meth: Scott William Sutherland, 49 (left), and Paul Anthony Darrah, 50 (right), were found not guilty of RICO and meth conspiracies. Darrah is known as the 'methamphetamine cook' Auhtorities all over the US were involved in the case, from the FBI to state police incolved with the assorted chapters. The Times-Herald reports the convictions as: Jeff Garvin Smith - 'Fat Dog' - was found guilty of racketeering influenced corrupt organization (RICO) conspiracy, methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy, conspiracy to obstruct justice, violent crimes in aid of racketeering (VICAR) and various substantive charges. Paul Anthony Darrah, also known as Pauli, 50 of Macomb Township, the national vice president of the Devil's Diciples, and Cary Dale Vandiver, 56 of Alabama, also known as Gun Control, the national warlord for the club, were found guilty of the same charges as Smith . Paul Anthony Darrah, also known as Pauli, 50 of Macomb Township, the national vice president of the Devil's Diciples, and Cary Dale Vandiver, 56 of Alabama, also known as Gun Control, the national warlord for the club, were found guilty of the same charges as Smith. Vincent John Witort, also known as Holiday, 64, of California, was found guilty of violations of the RICO and meth conspiracies. Patrick Michael McKeoun, 60 of Alabama, also known as Magoo, was found guilty of RICO and meth conspiracies. The U.S. Attorney's Office lists McKeoun as a 'methampetamine cook.' Lesser sentence: David Randy Drozdowski, 38, was spared charged of RICO and meth conspiracy, but was found guilty of VICAR and felon in possession of a firearm . David Randy Drozdowski, 38, of Fair Haven, also known as D, was found guilty of VICAR and felon in possession of a firearm. The jury was hung on charges of RICO and meth conspiracy. Scott William Sutherland, 49 of Redford, also known as Scotty Z, was found not guilty of RICO and meth conspiracies. He previously pleaded guilty to felon in possession. However defense attorney Jerome Sabbota, who was representing ringleader Smith, told The Detroit Free Press that the prosecution 'did not prove its case', and that Smith wrongly wore the blame for crimes committed separately by other members. 'These guys are not mafiosos,' Sabbota said. 'That's like saying because Obama is president he's responsible for everyone's misdeeds.' Long-running: The Devils Diciples - who purposely misspell their name - were first formed in 1967 . Online: The club has an official website that sells Devils Diciples merchandise, such as baby bibs . All six men will be sentenced at a later date. The group sells many products online via their website, including a baby bib that says: 'My dad can beat up everybody!'","Devils Diciples was formed in 1967 and has about 150 members in the U.S.

"More than £30million-worth of Range Rovers, Jaguars and Porsche emerged from the ill-fated carrier ship yesterday, after it ran aground off the English coast three weeks ago. But among the dented doors and scratched paintwork emerged a perfectly preserved armoured personnel carrier. The Hoegh Osaka was carrying 1,400 luxury cars including a £260,000 Rolls Royce Wraith on January 3, when it was deliberately grounded on Bramble Bank in the Solent to stop it capsizing. A spokesman for the shipping company described the damage to the cars as 'limited' but there are fears the entire fleet could have to be scrapped after a similar accident in 2006 wrecked 4,700 Mazdas. The cars were sent to the crusher after transporter MV Cougar Ace partially capsized in the North Pacific while carrying the cars away from the factory. It was left resting for just over three weeks - a similar length of time to the Hoegh Osaka - at an angle of 60 degrees. Scroll down for video . Untouched: Among the dented Jaguars and Porsche emerged a perfectly preserved armoured personnel carrier (pictured) Sturdy: The Hoegh Osaka was carrying 1,400 luxury cars including a £260,000 Rolls Royce Wraith on January 3 but the tank (pictured) was one of the few which was not damaged . Not a scratch: Unlike the armoured personnel carrier (pictured), there are fears the rest of the fleet could have to be scrapped after a similar accident in 2006 wrecked 4,700 Mazdas . Hundreds of Range Rovers, Jaguars and Porches began to be unloaded fromtransporter Hoegh Osaka yesterday, three weeks after it was deliberately run aground off the English coast when it started to list . It is not yet known what will become of the fleet of luxury cars, worth up to £30million, but there are fears the whole lot could have to be crushed after a similar transporter accident in 2006 lead to 4,700 Mazdas being destroyed . Authorities are carrying out a full examination of all the cars on board to see how extensively they have been damaged after the accident. This Porsche Boxter was left with large scratches and dents to its bodywork . A spokesman for the shipping line described the damage yesterdayas 'limited', but in 2006 a shipment of Mazdas in a similar condition were destroyed after resting at sea for three weeks at an angle of 60 degrees - almost identical conditions to the Osaka . Initially a Mazda spokesman said that only 68 cars had been damaged in the crash, either by slipping their moorings or rolling into other vehicles, but it was eventually decided that all 4,700 vehicles needed to be crushed. Engineers were worried about what effect resting at such a severe angle for so long would have on the inner workings of the cars, especially on the electrolyte in the batteries. Rather than open themselves up to the possibility of lawsuits due to mechanical faults, the company decided that it was safer to scrap the lot. The Osaka was deliberately run aground after it started to list at 52 degrees, a similar angle to the Cougar Ace, just after leaving Southampton port. A spokesman for Hoegh Autoliners said that each car was being inspected after being removed from the ship, and that a decision about their fate would not be made until that task was complete. It is not yet known what, if any, damaged was sustained by the Rolls Royce. If it is decided that all the vehicles need to be disposed of then the total bill will run into the tens of millions of pounds. Even if the cars are deemed road worthy, some of the new owners will still be left disappointed after the vehicles were pictured arriving on shore yesterday with dents and scratches to the bodywork. Back ashore: A red Jaguar F-type is driven back on to dry land after spending three weeks stranded on board the Hoegh Osaka . Valuable: The ship's cargo is thought to be worth £30million, leaving a huge bill for the accident if the cars have to be written off . Dozens of Range Rovers are on board, as well as Jaguars, and the incident could run into costs of tens of millions of pounds of damage . Mazda engineers were concerned about what effect resting at such a severe angle would have on the cars, particularly on the electrolytes in the batteries. If inspectors take the same decision over the Osaka (pictured), then the bill for the accident could run into tens of millions . The transporter was also carrying up to 80 agricultural or building plant machines, including a large stone-cutter machine weighing more than 30 tonnes. High winds and heavy rain hampered the rescue operation - even causing one of the tugs to smash into the Osaka as it was being towed. It was brought back to land last week so that its precious cargo could be unloaded. All of the cargo, which includes the cars and other equipment, will be taken off the ship by the end of this week or early next week, according to Hoegh Autoliners. A spokesman for Hoegh Autoliners' Navigate Response said: 'There is only limited damage to the cargo. 'Most of the lashings held, and only a couple of pieces - large machinery - shifted. Saved from the sea: Dock workers in Southampton help to drive a fleet of Range Rovers back on to shore after the ship they were on was run aground to stop it capsizing . Safe: These Range Rovers were just one part of a valuable cargo that included Jaguars, Porches, and a Rolls Royce Wraith thought to be worth £260,000 on its own . Line 'em up: The cars are moved into position at Southampton docks yesterday after the craft they were being carried on, the Hoegh Osaka, was towed back to dry land after three weeks stranded in the English channel . The ship arrived at Southampton on January 22 and crews yesterday began removing cars stowed on board, including Jaguars and Range Rovers . Officials said a full assessment of the damage would need to be carried out before it was decided what would happen to the large fleet of cars . 'Water damage only occured on the lowest deck and on the one side the ship was listing.' It is not yet known which vehicles were damaged by the sea water inside the ship and the spokesman said the vehicles were owned by 'a variety of parties' - including dealers and private owners. Cars which are damaged or do not start up will be towed off the ship. The spokesman said only preliminary checks had been carried out at this stage and a full assessment would be completed once every car was back on dry land, so they could make a decision about what to do with damaged vehicles. The Singapore-registered Hoegh Osaka was heading to the Middle East was deliberately grounded when it started to list just 45 minutes after leaving the port of Southampton. Vehicles, many seemingly undamaged, were seen rolling off the ship, and it could take up to a week for all the cars to be removed from it . The Hoegh Osaka was stranded in the Solent from January 3 after it started listing at about 9.20pm, 45 minutes into a journey to Germany . Salvage firm Svitzer managed to complete ballast management to reduce the list of the ship to five degrees and it was towed back to shore . The 25 person crew had to be rescued by RNLI lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter with two people suffering non-life threatening injuries during the incident. The cargo ship, which is 180 metres long and 32 metres wide, finally arrived back in Southampton on January 22. A spokeswoman from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) confirmed they were investigating what had caused the large vessel to list so dramatically. January 3, 8.30pm - The Hoegh Osaka, a Singapore-registered ship, left the port of Southampton  bound for Bremerhaven in Germany.The 180 metre long ship was bound for Germany, and loaded with 1,400 cars including Land Rovers, Jaguars and a £260,000 Rolls Royce. January 3, 9.20pm - About 45 minutes after it left the port the 15 year old ship started to list badly at 52 degrees. It was deliberately grounded by the crew, near the Isle of Wight in Hampshire, to prevent it capsizing. A rescue operation was then launched to rescue the captain and 25 crew members. It is understood the cargo ship, which has a nine-metre draught, turned sharply to the left as it passed the notorious Bramble Bank sandbank near Cowes and ran aground. Following the incident a 200 metre exclusion zone was set up around the ship, to prevent other vessels interfering with the tugs. January 5 - Salvage experts unsuccessfully tried to re-float the huge ship by using four tugs to pull it off the sandbank. The Hoegh Osaka was deliberately grounded in the Solent, around 20 minutes into its journey, after it started listing at 52 degrees . January 7 - The ship was floated from Bramble Bank on the high tide and tugs were used to tow it to Alpha Anchorage near Lee-on-the-Solent. January 10 - One of the tugs crashed into the ship during a period of high winds.An excavator that was on board shifted during the sailing and punched a hole in the side of the hull, which was quickly repaired. But some 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel. January 17 - The 3,000 tonnes of water was pumped out and into empty fuel tanks on board. January 22 - Salvage firm Svitzer was able to complete ballast management and reduce the ship's list to five degrees. It was then towed to Southampton Docks by four tugs.During its journey, an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place, set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side. Airspace was also restricted to one mile around the route as a precaution. Hundreds of people gathered at Southampton Water to watch the ship complete its three hour journey back to the port. January 27 - luxury cars, including Range Rovers and a Porsche, started to be driven off the ship. Around 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel when a hole was punched in its side and this had to be pumped out from the car carrier .","Dozens of damaged luxury Range Rovers and a Porsche were driven off the large car transporter ship yesterday .

"Christian schools in Britain are under investigation by the European Commission for allegedly 'discriminating' against non-religious teachers. The probe could ultimately force schools with a Christian ethos to stop giving preference to religious staff when recruiting, it is understood. The schools will be scrutinised to see if expressing a preference for religious teachers – and having the right to pay them more than non-believing colleagues – breaches equality laws. European Union rules state that a school must be able to prove a 'genuine occupational requirement' in order to discriminate in favour of a religious candidate. The European Commission is set to investigate Christian schools in Britain to see if they breach equality laws when expressing a preference to religious staff . Many schools which advertise for staff list a religion as a 'desirable feature' in those who apply. However, the British Humanist Association, whose complaints sparked the inquiry, says describing religious adherence as 'desirable' falls short of the EU standard. Richy Thompson, campaigns officer at the BHA, told the Times Education Supplement: 'If religious practice is a 'desirable' quality and not an essential one, then it cannot be a genuine occupational requirement. It should either be essential or not there at all.' Other faith schools including Muslim and Jewish schools will also be examined. The case also brings into question government guidance that gives voluntary-aided faith schools, which are part-funded by religious organisations, the freedom to apply 'religious criteria when recruiting or dismissing any member of their teaching staff'. The schools can give preference to religious candidates in 'recruitment, remuneration and promotion', Equality Act guidance states. The BHA has asked the commission to investigate whether the government guidance is at odds with the EU directive. Paul Barber, director of the Catholic Education Service, told the TES that faith schools should determine 'on an individual basis' whether they required a religious candidate for a particular role. He said: 'They need to look at the full circumstances of each job.' Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: 'Church schools are hugely popular with parents. 'They are oversubscribed and they dominate performance tables. The church ethos is why they have high standards and why they do such a good job of preparing children for life in 21st-century Britain. A complaint by the British Humanist Association sparked the investigation by Brussels . 'It's disappointing that humanists seem to be so intolerant of religious organisations seeking to remain religious. There's a relentless agenda to secularise religious organisations. If they were to succeed, it would severely damage these church schools and undermine the great work that they do.' A spokesman for the London Diocesan Board for Schools, which runs 133 primary schools and 20 secondaries, said its schools usually sought a 'Christian commitment' only when filling senior leadership positions. He added: 'However, even then, in the majority of those cases, a school will be looking more for someone who will actively support the Christian traditions and ethos of the school, rather than a 'card-carrying' member of the Christian church. 'We have senior staff in our schools who are adherents of various faiths and many who have no personal faith.' A spokesman for the Department for Education said the Government's guidance allowing faith schools to apply religious criteria was in line with the 'genuine occupational requirement' rule set out in the EU directive. A spokesman for the European Commission confirmed it is considering the complaint and had contacted the British authorities.","European Commission to investigate Christian schools in Britain .

"A student pilot who lost half a wing in a potentially disastrous mid-air collision with his instructor managed to land his fighter jet safely. The unnamed airman brought his F-16C back to base after losing five feet from the plane's right wing above Kansas during a mock dogfight. He smashed into his instructor after losing sight of him during the practice encounter - sending the second fighter jet plummeting to earth. Ravaged fighter: An accident left this F-16C fighter jet without half a wing - but its trainee pilot managed to bring it home safely . Mid-air smash: The pilot smashed into a jet flown by his instructor after a practice dogfight went wrong . While the plane was obliterated when it hit the ground, its pilot managed to eject in time and was not badly hurt. Meanwhile the student managed to bring his damaged vehicle 100 miles south to an air base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and made a safe landing. Images of the collision were released this week as part of an Air Force investigation into the crash. According to the Washington Post, investigators determined that a missile on the right wing tip of the student's plane tore through the right wing of his instructor's plane, close to the fuselage. Less lucky: The instructor's jet was destroyed when it crashed into a Kansas field - though the instructor himself managed to eject and was not badly hurt . Wreckage: The smashed plane, which lost parts of its wing and tail fin in mid-air, is seen here where it landed . Damaged: Air Force investigators estimated that the accident cost $22.5million . In one piece: Both pilots were at the controls of an F-16C fighter jet, pictured above in Las Vegas, Nevada (file) It then also hit the plane's right-hand tail fin, sending the plane hurtling to earth. The student shouted repeatedly over the radio for the instructor to bail out, which he did, landing just 60ft from the wreckage of the plane. The collision came after both student and instructor misinterpreted the other's maneuvers and turned towards one another at an altitude of 7,500ft. The two planes were supposed to be coordinating to hunt down a third plane in the training flight. They successfully staged one engagement, but disaster struck during a second run.

"Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver and Blur star Alex James are facing opposition from residents in the sleepy Cotswolds village of Kingham over plans to expand their music and food festival. The celebrity chef and Blur bassist want to keep the party going at this year's The Big Feastival for longer, with extended hours for live and recorded music and alcohol sales. However, the plans have been met with outrage by some nearby residents, who fear the 'creeping expansion' of the festival in the otherwise quiet village. Attempts to extend the music and alcohol sale hours for the music festival, which is the brainchild of Blur bassist Alex James (left) and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver (right), have been met by local opposition . Around 16,000 people flocked to James' farm in the Oxfordshire countryside last year and some are concerned by the threat of more noise and traffic. Organisers of The Big Feastival, which runs from August 28 to 30, have asked West Oxfordshire District Council to let them have an extra 14 hours of live and recorded music at the event. Among the music acts due to perform at the festival this summer are Fatboy Slim, Jamie Cullum and Laura Mvula. One opponent to the proposals, Judy Lewis from nearby Lyneham, said the music 'penetrates our homes and causes a nuisance and disturbance' and that the extension times asked for were 'excessive'. Dr Carole Sherwood, a consultant clinical psychologist who also lives in Lyneham, raised concerns about the impact of the festival on a neighbouring nursing home. Dr Sherwood said she found it 'hard to believe' that residents at the Langston Kingham Nursing Home would be unaffected by the music and suggested the Care Quality Commission might also take a dim view of the situation. 'As a health professional myself I feel very uneasy about the way this festival is developing in scale, year-on-year, in terms of number attending and extension into the early hours of the morning of both live and recorded music,' said Dr Sherwood. 'In view of the very close proximity of The Langston to the festival site I would hope that the needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people is given high priority when considering whether or not to grant this variation of licence.' Baking star: Great British Bake Off 2012 runner up Ruth Clements with Blur bassist Alex James last year . TV presenter Anthea Turner (left) and friends were amongst the revellers who attended the festival last year . Michael and Sarah English, who also live in Lyneham, said: 'We are aware that last year's festival brought considerable disturbance to some Lyneham residents and beyond. 'With this in mind, we are concerned that this latest application represents an incremental drift towards a much large music festival which may not sit easily in the locality.' Another couple, Brian Murphy and Jean Ware-Morphy, added: 'The extensions would make the noise of the festival very intrusive into the life of our family, which includes three children under seven, and risk disorder well into the night.' Festival organisers also want recorded music to start two hours earlier on the Friday, at 10am, and be played until 1am on Saturday instead of finishing at 11pm on Friday.

"Romanian prisoners have overtaken other nationalities to top the league table of foreign inmates jailed in Britain, shocking figures from the Ministry of Justice reveal. The statistics, which cover the period when restrictions were lifted on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants in early 2014, will reignite the debate on ‘open-door’ EU immigration as the Election approaches. Overall, one prisoner in eight in English and Welsh jails is a foreign national, the figures show. Crackdown:  A Roma beggar, who is not accused of theft, is arrested in Westminster, London. Romanian prisoners have overtaken other nationalities to top the league table of foreign inmates jailed in Britain . That proportion has doubled in the past ten years, corresponding with the mass influx of immigration from Eastern Europe. But a more detailed breakdown by nationality of all inmates shows that Romanians, Albanians and Lithuanians are all proportionately far more likely to be imprisoned than Britons. The figures reveal that the Romanians’ speciality is shoplifting in organised gangs, leading to suspicions that the much-vaunted EU principle of freedom of movement is being abused by criminals. Tory MP Philip Davies, who obtained the figures, called them ‘staggering and unacceptable’. The tables, which cover prisoners jailed between October 2013 and March 2014, represent the most comprehensive breakdown of inmates’ countries of origin. Crime by crime: Who are the biggest culprits? Foreign prisoners in UK jails ranked by offence . They also reveal marked differences in the likelihood of different nationalities to be jailed, when adjusted for the number of those nationals living in Britain. Whereas Poland, which has the largest population of 617,000 in the UK, ranks high in the table, with 573 prisoners imprisoned, it comes second to Romania, which saw 760 of its 126,000 population incarcerated. It means Romanians are more than six times as likely as Poles to end up in jail, and eight times as likely as Britons. The bulk of those jailed – 34,168 out of 39,773 – are Britons and only a tiny minority of foreign nationals fall foul of the law. Overall, the most likely foreigners to be imprisoned were Vietnamese and Albanians – with more than one per cent of their respective populations in Britain (10,000 and 11,000) jailed in that time. Pictured above: How we highlighted the pickpocketing issue in the UK, and a police warning sign . A previous National Audit Office study, showing the top ten nationalities of foreign prisoners in 2013-14, placed Romania fourth behind Poland, Ireland and Jamaica. The growing numbers of Romanian criminals entering the British justice system is underlined by separate data obtained from police forces, showing about 11,000 Romanians are arrested each year. That works out at about two per cent of total arrests – the vast majority of them for shoplifting – even though Romanians only make up 0.2 per cent of the general population. Our figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, showed that in every force area, Romanians committed more shoplifting offences than any other crime. Mr Davies, MP for Shipley, West Yorkshire, said: ‘This lays bare that free movement of people in the EU also means free movement of criminals within the EU. ‘We are unnecessarily opening our borders to lots of people to commit crimes, who create unnecessary victims of crime in the UK. That is one of the reasons why we would be better off out of the EU – so we could control immigration and stop some of these criminals before they get into the country. Nation by nation: Eastern Europeans take top three slots for most people jailed here who are from abroad . ‘It is absolutely staggering. It has created unnecessary victims of crime, is costing us a fortune in police time and prison places. It is completely unacceptable.’ Lord Green, Migration Watch chairman, said: ‘These statistics strengthen the case for tightening the arrangements within the EU for the removal of convicted criminals to their countries of origin, as the Government have proposed.’ The MoJ figures also provide an insight into the types of crimes favoured by different foreign criminals. While Poland tops the league for violence, with 156 jailed for these offences, 18 Romanians were imprisoned for sexual offences, ahead of Pakistanis and Poles. Robbery offences saw Irish prisoners take the top spot, with 15 custodial sentences, and Romanians and Somalis came a close second with 14 each. Romanians feature in the top five for most offence categories – in crimes involving burglary, theft and handling, and fraud and forgery, they are out in front. Second in the fraud and forgery stakes were Nigerian prisoners, who came seventh in the table of all crimes committed. For drugs crimes, the Vietnamese were ahead with 118 of their prisoners jailed for, predominantly, being in charge of cannabis farms. Anoma Paul (pictured) was duped by a prolific gang of eight Romanian burglars and shoplifters . Highly organised gangs of Romanians have targeted British stores on an almost industrial scale in recent years. One of those to have fallen victim to such groups was newsagent Anoma Paul, from Pontypridd, Mid Glamorgan, who was duped by a particularly prolific gang of eight Romanian burglars and shoplifters. Mrs Paul was in charge of the shop when a large group of mostly women asked for her help. As she went around the newsagent helping them to find items, other members of the gang sneaked into the upstairs flat where they raided her daughter’s bedroom. They stole jewellery that her daughter had been given from friends and family for her 18th and 21st birthdays. Mrs Paul said: ‘I was helping them and they distracted my attention. I thought they were a bit unruly; I was a bit worried but I could see they had money in their hands.’ She revealed that one of the tactics the gang used was to bombard her with several different requests at once. ‘I was trying to please them all,’ she said. ‘I was serving them and I suddenly turned around and saw somebody coming out of the private door to our home. They robbed me and then they were gone.’ Mrs Paul, who has owned the newsagent with her husband for 28 years, added: ‘Afterwards, I was really frightened of foreigners coming into the shop. I get really sweaty and worried that it will be the same people coming in. ‘I think some of the Romanians are interested in coming to this country just to rob people.’ The gang were jailed for more than 24 years after a nationwide crime spree netted them £170,000 of goods and cash.","Figures reveal Romanians top league table for foreign inmates jailed in UK .

"She came to Britain for a fresh start, a chance to put her chaotic Hollywood lifestyle behind her. It was, she insisted, time to 'grow up'. But Lindsay Lohan's hopes of starting anew could unravel as early as this week – and in spectacular fashion. The actress faces allegations that she failed to complete 240 hours of court-ordered community service that she had vowed to carry out in London. And embroiled in the controversy is a prominent British charity, which has been accused of helping her inflate the number of hours she spent carrying out her punishment. Scroll down for video . Lindsay Lohan faces allegations that she failed to complete 240 hours of court-ordered community service. British charity Community Service Volunteers (pictured) has been accused of helping her inflate numbers . The claim raises the question of whether Community Service Volunteers (CSV) colluded with the actress in exchange for publicity – an allegation the charity denies. Miss Lohan arrived in London last autumn to star in a West End production of David Mamet's play, Speed The Plow. It would, she hoped, prove her credentials as a serious actress. But at the time she had still not completed the community service she received for reckless driving after her Porsche collided with a truck in 2012. An American judge agreed to allow Miss Lohan to complete the hours in London with the help of CSV, whose chairman is Labour peer Lord Levy. Now, according to official documents filed in the US courts, the charity says she has not only completed the 240 hours, but exceeded them in the short time between October and January. But The Mail on Sunday has seen documents and spoken to well-informed sources which suggest she has done no such thing, raising questions about what activities have been logged as 'community service'. Lohan was quick to post a photograph of herself with CSV's Is Szoneberg (left), director of volunteering operations, and Laura Doughty (centre), director of external affairs and fundraising, on her Instagram . A source close to the Speed The Plow production told this newspaper that Miss Lohan's plans to fit her punishment around the play's demanding schedule had 'always been a concern' for producers. 'The people behind the play wanted to know if she would be able to do both,' the source said. 'Lindsay's people insisted that they would be able to work it into her schedule, but it was clear that it would not have been possible.' That question appeared to be a key topic at her initial meeting with CSV on October 6 last year. According to another source, the subject of inflating Miss Lohan's hours was openly discussed. 'They knew they couldn't do it,' said the source. 'The question was asked if the hours could be padded. You know, could they say she did 90 per cent of it? CSV said they would see what they could do – wink, wink – and mentioned fundraising and publicity.' The source added that Miss Lohan was then quick to post a photograph of herself with CSV's Is Szoneberg, director of volunteering operations, and Laura Doughty, director of external affairs and fundraising, on her Instagram account, which has almost 3 million followers. Under the picture she wrote: 'Another great meeting with @CSV_UK making a difference every single day.' She accentuated the message with symbols of a heart and hands in a prayer position. 'It was all, 'what can we do for her and what can she do for us',' said the source. In other documents seen by this newspaper, CSV agreed to sign off hours for Miss Lohan 'retroactively' and also agreed that the initial meeting between the actress, her team and CSV could count towards her total. It was also asked whether Miss Lohan's appearance at last year's Women of the Year Awards in London could count towards her punishment. CSV suggested that it could. The charity advised Miss Lohan's team that this would not be linked to CSV. But according to the official log, four hours were assigned by CSV on the day of the awards. The log also says Miss Lohan spent 56 hours working with or on behalf of CSV's charitable community project, the Red Route Cafe in Hackney. American officials have their doubts. Terry White, lead prosecutor in Miss Lohan's US case, last month challenged both the type of work Miss Lohan claimed to have done – and even if she had done it at all. The star's official volunteering log submitted to the court states that she carried out administrative and planning work with the charity, agreed to 'meet and greet' young volunteers after performances of Speed The Plow, and allow other young volunteers to shadow her. Miss Lohan arrived in London last autumn to star in a West End production of David Mamet's play, Speed The Plow, pictured yesterday at the launch of 'Hunger Magazine, We've Got Issues' at W London . Her 'work shadowing' role was 'most questionable', Mr White said, telling a court: 'Work shadowing basically is hanging out with her. I'd love to hang out with a celebrity. That's not community service.' But he also took issue with the timeline of hours on Miss Lohan's log. He questioned, for example, just how the star was able to complete 30 hours for CSV from January 19 to 21 while also being treated for a virus picked up in Bora Bora. '[A] note says she received acute care for three days, but on those three days, again, ten hours [per day] were served,' Mr White told the court, adding: 'I'm having trouble not only with the quality of the work but whether or not the work was actually done.' Last week it was reported that Miss Lohan successfully lobbied US car insurance firm Esurance to donate $10,000 (£6,500) to CSV. CSV is well respected, so how did it come to be embroiled in this way? Was the organisation star-struck by the actress, hungry for the publicity Miss Lohan could bring with her 8.8 million Twitter followers? 'This girl has manipulated a British organisation,' the source said. 'They were hoodwinked into letting her get away with it. People are in awe of Lindsay. But this is celebrity manipulation and it's not fair. She did the crime in LA so should have done the punishment there. 'It's one rule for ordinary citizens and another for celebrities. She didn't do those hours. It makes a mockery of the legal system. This is someone who has had so many chances. But now I wonder if this community service hearing is going to be the crunch? Will she now go to jail?' Mr White told The Mail on Sunday that a prison sentence would not be ruled out for Miss Lohan if she is found in breach of her probation terms on Wednesday. Despite her wild child reputation, she is understood to have conducted her working life with some degree of professionalism. Although Speed The Plow is thought to have lost £200,000, cast and crew were impressed by her performances. Miss Lohan's spokesman would not comment on the allegations last night. CSV chief executive Oonagh Aitken said: 'I am not aware of anything which would support such an allegation. We take our responsibilities in relation to all kinds of volunteering with great seriousness.'","Lindsay Lohan accused of failing to finish 240 hours community service .

"A social media campaign with the hashtag #CoinForAustralia has been established by Indonesian Twitter users after Prime Minister Tony Abbott likened Australia's $1 billion in tsunami aid to the clemency bid for Bali Nine duo, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. The Twitter campaign, in which users have posted pictures of their donations to Australia, urges Indonesians to gather coins to return to Mr Abbott, after he suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'. The backlash comes after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution, after linking the men's fate to Australia's aid donation following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia.

Julie Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians  Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful,Fairfax reported. Ms Bishop told The Sydney Morning Herald that she had informed Mr Kalla that the comments were not intended as a threat, and were instead an indication of the long friendship between Australia and Indonesia. 'I said I regretted if this comment was seen as anything other than that,' she said. This Twitter user posted a picture with the caption: 'Here take your 1 dollar' Indonesians have flocked to Twitter in anger at Tony Abbott's comments which likened Australia's aid donation after the tsunami to the clemency bid for the Bali Nine duo . The two Australians were convicted of smuggling heroin, a crime that carries the death penalty in Indonesia. Mr Abbott's comments sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'. Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'. Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful' Indonesians have reacted badly to Tony Abbott's comments and have started a social media campaign . 'It undid a lot of the good work,' a source told Fairfax . Sukumaran and Chan were due to be transferred this week from Bali to a high-security prison on Kambangan island ahead of execution, but that was delayed after appeals from Canberra that the men be granted more time with their families. Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers  'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons,' without elaborating further.

"A woman who tried to rescue the life of a dying dog has lashed out at the animal's owner. Heather Mozingo, of Hockley, Texas, was driving her car a little after 10pm on February 13 when she narrowly missed hitting a dog as he ran across the darkened, and busy, road. Seconds later, a car behind her did hit the dog, and that is when Mozingo stopped what she was doing and leaped into action. Scroll down for video . Heather Mozingo (left) tried to save the life of an unidentified dog (right) after he was hit by a car . The dog was crossing a busy Texas road (above) a little after 10pm on February 13 with no collar or tags . 'It was just adrenaline when I realized it was alive,' she told FOX 26. 'Oh my God we have to do something, pick it up get it help.' That is when she and a friend loaded the animal into her truck and took it to the vet where, after a four hour operation and $800 bill that Mozingo paid out of her own pocket, the dog ultimately had to be put down. Making matters worse was the fact that the dog had neither a collar, tags or a microchip to help in locating the owner. 'He was suffering, he was in a lot of pain. It was a very tough decision. We all cried, my friend cried, her daughter sobbed. I petted him and held his head while they did it. I made sure I was there so he wasn't alone,' said Mozingo. When she got home however, she got on Facebook and turned that sadness into rage at the 'irresponsible Dog Owner' that in her opinion was to blame for this tragedy. 'Through your irresponsibility I had to become responsible for your dogs health and future. I didn't ask for that responsibility nor did I want it, but you failed your dog,' she wrote. 'I cried over your dog for an hour while I struggled to make a decision based on what was best for a dog I'd only just met when I was scraping him off the asphalt a few hours earlier.' 'You didn't deserve him. You may have had him first, but he was MY dog when his heart stopped beating,' said Mozingo . She ended by saying; 'I'll never even know his name, but I loved him because you failed him. He should have been growing up safe, healthy, and warm at home, not scared and running through busy roads at night. He didn't deserve that, none of them do. And you didn't deserve him. You may have had him first, but he was MY dog when his heart stopped beating.' It is still not known who owned the dog. Dear Irresponsible Dog Owner, . Is this your dog? Some kids told me he lived on Main Blvd, tomball, off FM 2920. I know it's hard to tell what he looks like through the blood on his face and since he's all wrapped up and strapped down. In case you are wondering where he went, he died in my arms on Valentines Day at 1:16 am. In case you care, which I doubt, he was running across FM 2920 (the busiest road in tomball with a 55mph speed limit) at 10pm Friday the 13th. I barely missed hitting him with my truck, but turned around to make sure he got help to safety. In those 30 seconds it took me to turn my truck around, someone hit him. I thought he was dead in the middle of the road until he lifted his head. No one stopped but me. The same kids that told me he lived on Main Blvd, kids that were too young to be out past dark wandering the streets, had scared him back into the road and watched him get hit. They obviously knew the dog, and it seemed intentional if you ask me. I pulled into the middle of the road and my friend and I wrapped him in my jacket and put him with her in the backseat where she comforted him all the way to the Animal ER while he bled all over my $70,000 truck. But YOUR dog was more important to me than my interior. In case you care, your dog was a complete sweetheart even though he was in enormous pain due to your negligence. I then spent the next 4 hours in the ER with your dog. He had a severely broken leg and bruised, swollen, fluid filled lungs, in case you were wondering. Again, just in case you were wondering, I know about the leg that was broken through the growth plate and about the lung damage (oh yeah, can't forget the head trauma also) because of the 400ish dollars I spent on radiographs for your dog. And of course he had no tags or identification of any kind so I became responsible for YOUR dogs life and the $780 final vet bill for him. The vet also informed me he was only about 8 months old, by the way. Through your irresponsibility I had to become responsible for your dogs health and future. I didn't ask for that responsibility nor did I want it, but you failed your dog. I sat with your dog for hours going through diagnostics trying to determine if he could recover. I petted your dog and comforted him so he didn't feel abandoned. I cried over your dog for an hour while I struggledto make a decision based on what was best for a dog I'd only just met when I was scraping him off the asphalt a few hours earlier. I had to be strong enough to say the words and tell the vet to euthanize your dog and end his suffering. I sobbed while I tried to let him know that I loved him and I was there for him when you weren't, and I held his head until he took his last breath. I'll never even know his name, but I loved him because you failed him. He should have been growing up safe, healthy, and warm at home, not scared and running through busy roads at night. He didn't deserve that, none of them do. And you didn't deserve him. You may have had him first, but he was MY dog when his heart stopped beating. Sincerely, .

"A study found men shell out £106 for a bag on average – £42 more than women, who spend £64 . It will come as a shock to any woman who's ever splashed out on the latest designer handbag, but men actually spend more on their 'manbags'. A study found men shell out £106 for a bag on average – £42 more than women, who spend around £64. Manbags are most popular among younger age groups. Overall, one in ten men carries a bag most days, but this rises to a fifth among under-25s. Market researcher Mintel found men are more likely to choose bags made by luxury brands, while women tend to look for cheaper High Street styles. While each year three fifths of women buy themselves a new bag, a fifth of boyfriends or husband have bought a handbag as a present too. Last year the handbag market grew by nearly ten per cent to £1.3 billion and is expected to reach £1.9 billion by 2019. Senior Fashion Analyst Tamara Sender said: 'Whilst manbags in the past have been met with mockery, men have now begun to see the item as acceptable to wear most of the time and as they become accustomed to the practicality of using a manbag they are likely to continue to use them as they age. 'Gifting is very important to the handbag market and given that men are inclined to spend more than women when buying handbags, this highlights the scope to help men with the handbag gift buying process. 'Retailers could offer a personalised gift shopping service allowing consumers to speak to a personal shopper via an online chat who can recommend potential handbags that would suit their partner or whoever they are buying for.'

"Russian President Vladimir Putin just about managed to squeeze another medal onto the chest of Valentin Gavrilov as the 91-year-old was recognised for his service during the Second World War. The retired colonel, who was injured near Stalingrad but recovered to later take charge of a tank battalion, was pictured receiving a jubilee medal to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the war. War hero Mr Gavrilov, who was sporting 59 other medals for his military service, was one of dozens of Russian veterans celebrated at the ceremony at the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow. Room for one more? Vladimir Putin awards Second World War veteran Valentin Gavrilov with a 59th medal . The 91-year-old narrowly escaped death near Stalingrad in 1942, where he served as a young lieutenant, when his tank burst into flames after being hit by enemy fire, the Daily Telegraph reported. He returned to battle as a captain  in November 1944 and was in charge of the headquarters of a tank battalion. In 1945, Mr Gavrilov played a role in the East Prussian offensive against what remained of the Nazi forces, storming Königsberg - now known as Kaliningrad. The key city, which is now a Russian enclave, was stormed by Soviet forces. Mr Gavrilov was among those on the front line as troops overcame the Gneisenau Fort, one of the German's strongholds. The veteran told a Russian newspaper earlier this month how he found eight members of the SS hiding in a basement as the Soviets liberated Kaliningrad. The men, who were wearing dresses and headscarves to try and conceal their identities, were executed. The retired colonel, who was injured near Stalingrad but recovered to later take charge of a tank battalion, was pictured receiving a jubilee medal to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the war . Mr Gavrilov's medals include four Orders of the Red Star - given for courage, valour and leadership on the battlefield - a feat only achieved by nine other people. He also echoed Putin's opinion on the conflict in Ukraine in the interview, saying that he supported those fighting against what he called the 'fascist' Kiev government. He added: 'I'd go and fight on the side of the militia myself – our veterans say the same thing. But they wouldn't take me. I'm almost 92.' The battle for Stalingrad was the turning point of the Second World War. Following the German invasion of Russia — Operation Barbarossa, which began in June 1941 — the Wehrmacht swept eastwards, destroying whole Soviet armies and capturing two million prisoners, most of whom they starved to death. Scenting final victory, Hitler ordered a dash for Stalingrad, while another German army group swung southwards to grab the oilfields. Hitler’s top soldiers were appalled by the perils of splitting the Wehrmacht merely to capture Stalingrad, which was strategically unimportant. Their protests were ignored: the Fuhrer insisted. On September 12, the first German troops entered Stalingrad. The first German air attacks killed between 10,000 and 40,000 people — almost as many as died in the entire London blitz. Shellfire and bombs rained down on the city, day after day and week upon week. The concrete masses of the city’s transport hubs and industrial plants were swiftly reduced to rubble. Each became a scene of slaughter . Each night, up to three thousand Russian wounded were ferried eastward from the city, while a matching stream of reinforcements, ammunition and supplies reached the defenders. New units were thrust into the battle as fast as they arrived, to join duels in the ruins that often became hand-to-hand death grapples. The five-month battle eventually ended in February after the Soviets employed a two-pronged attack to encircle the German forces, who were ordered to stand their ground and fight instead of trying to break free. The battle is regarded by many as the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with estimates of between 1.25million and 1.8million deaths.","Vladimir Putin awards Russian Valentin Gavrilov his 59th military medal .

"A 31-year-old medical saleswoman has been found murdered in her suburban Arizona home in mysterious circumstances. Allison Feldman, 31, was found dead at home by her boyfriend in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale Wednesday afternoon. Police have not revealed whether there was a break-in, what her injuries were, whether there was a struggle, or whether anything was taken from the single-story home, flanked by palm trees. Murdered: Allison Feldman, a 31-year-old saleswoman for a Swedish medical device company, was found dead in her home in Scottsdale, Arizona . According to family, Feldman 'had no negatives in her life', was happy in her job - and planned to get engaged to her boyfriend, Alex, in a matter of months. Authorities say they are withholding details of Feldman's death for fear of tipping of potential suspects in the killing. Though they declined to identify anybody they are looking for, officers are clear that the death is a homicide. Scottsdale police department also said they had no history of being called to Feldman's address, on the edge of the bustling Old Town district. According to the local Fox10 news station, Feldman had lived at the home for eight months, and had been seeing her boyfriend for ten. Emergency: Police rushed to Feldman's home in Scottsdale on Wednesday afternoon after her boyfriend found her body . Feldman, who comes from Minnesota but has lived in Arizona since college, was encouraged to get an alarm system by her boyfriend, but hadn't got round to taking the advice. Her father today spoke of the agony of not knowing anything his daughter's death as he paid tribute to the 'warm and friendly' woman. Speaking from his home in Excelsior, Minnesota, Harley Feldman said: 'It's really hard because he have all kinds of visualizations going on. We can't sleep at night.' He described how his daughter worked in sales for a Swedish medical-device company and graduated from the University of Arizona, where she studied Spanish and communications. She remained in Arizona after college partly because of the much warmer weather. Suburbia: Feldman's single-story home, pictured, is just outside of Scottsdale's bustling Old Town . The two last spoke Tuesday night. She was excited for a business trip to a resort and had just bought a new dress. She also got a positive performance review at work. He said: 'Her life was on the upswing. She was talking about getting engaged in a few months. No negatives in her life.' 'Everybody liked her. She's warm and friendly. She's caring. Those are the words people use all the time.' He, his wife and Allison's sister are now planning funeral services in Minnesota and Arizona.","Allison Feldman, 31, was found dead in Scottsdale, Arizona on Wednesday .

"A Sydney mayor who was allegedly assaulted at a primary school on Saturday afternoon has been taken to hospital unconscious after he was reportedly 'king hit'. Bill Pickering - who is the mayor of Ryde in Sydney's northwest - was handing out sandwiches when he was confronted by independent candidate Vic Tagg, deputy mayor Roy Maggio told Nine News. Cr Maggio, who was also at Putney Public School for a council by-election today, says the mayor was 'king hit'. It is believed the mayor then fell to the ground and had a seizure. Scroll down for video . A Sydney mayor who was allegedly assaulted at a primary school on Saturday afternoon has been taken to hospital unconscious after he was reportedly 'king hit' Mayor of Ryde Bill Pickering (left) has been taken to hospital unconscious after an alleged attack. Witnesses say he was 'king hit' by independent candidate Vic Tagg (right) 'He [Mr Tagg] king hit him [Cr Pickering] front on and the mayor fell down,' Liberal Cr Maggio told Nine News. Witnesses say Cr Pickering - a member of the Liberal party - was handing out sandwiches to voters at a council polling booth for Ryde’s East Ward by-election, when Mr Tagg claimed the Liberal party was 'corrupt' before allegedly punching the mayor. The by-election was prompted by the resignation of former mayor and independent councillor Ivan Petch in December. Mr Petch withdrew his position from council after the Independent Commission against Corruption made corrupt conduct findings against him. A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia inquiries are continuing as they are currently questioning a number of witnesses. No arrests have been made. Police were called to the school on Morrison Road at about 2pm today, following reports of an assault. 'Initial investigations suggest that a 52-year-old man was assaulted by another man known to him, who left the school before police arrived,' a police spokesperson said. Cr Pickering, the 52-year-old, was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Ryde Hospital. Fellow Liberal councillor Craig Chung told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked when he heard about the alleged assault. 'Violence of any sort is a terrible blight on our democracy and violence allegedly from a candidate is just deplorable,' he said. Cr Chung says he was told the mayor will be spending the night in hospital. He is believed to be in a stable condition. Police are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward.","Mayor of Ryde Bill Pickering has been taken to hospital unconscious after an alleged attack .

"The neighbour of three aristocratic daughters claims that being next to their London home is like 'living next door to a nightclub'. Jackie Elliot, who works in marketing and communications lives next door to Lady Violet Manners, 21,  and her sisters Lady Alice, 19, and Lady Eliza, 17, in their £2.6 million house on Bovingdon Road, Fulham. However, despite their aristocratic upbringing Lady Violet has been branded 'Violet no-manners' after she uploaded a letter of complaint to the internet. Scroll down for video . Neighbours of Lady Violet Manners, left, and her sisters Lady Eliza, centre, and Lady Alice, right, have complained about the late night parties being held at the girls' £2.6  million home in Fulham, London .

Neighbour Jackie Elliot has written to the girls' father the Duke of Rutland, pictured, who is worth £125 million, at his home in Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire to complain about his daughters' poor conduct . Mrs Elliot, who has lived on the road for more than two decades, has written to the girls' father the Duke of Rutland at the Grade I listed Belvoir Castle in Grantham, Leicestershire to complain about their conduct. However, she claims Lady Violet uploaded the correspondence on the internet. Speaking this morning, Lady Violet, who is the public relations executive for British Polo said: 'I would rather not comment.' Terraced houses on the exclusive road which is only a short stroll from Chelsea Harbour have increased in value ten-fold from the mid 1990s. However, neighbours complain that Lady Victoria and her sisters have caused significant disturbance with late night parties.

Loud music, people coming and going very late, talking in the road, shouting, cars arriving, cars going. It's like having a nightclub on your doorstep in the middle of a quiet terraced street. 'I have written to ""Violet no-manners"" as we call her, several times and sent text messages. Sometimes she apologises but it doesn't stop. Around early February  I wrote to the Duke. He wrote back a short letter which was perfectly courteous and said he had made the ""occupants"" aware of its contents.' However, Lady Victoria, whose father is worth an estimated £125 million, uploaded the letter onto the internet. Mrs Elliot continued: 'It is typical of the immaturity and lack of manners they have. We are highly tolerant, relaxed neighbours but we are living somewhere where you can't get a decent night's sleep.

"The parents of Kayla Mueller, the American aid worker who was killed in ISIS captivity, are speaking out for the first time about her death. Marsha and Carl Mueller sat down with Today's Savannah Guthrie to pay tribute to their 26-year-old daughter in an interview screening on Monday. Kayla's brother, Eric Mueller, will also address their loss and his hopes that people will be provoked into researching and understanding the plight of Syrian refugees. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaking out: Carl and Marsha Mueller and their son Eric have spoken to Today's savannah Guthrie about losing Kayla, 26, the U.S. aid worker who was killed earlier this month while in captivity in Syria, held by ISIS . It comes after a candlelit vigil in the plaza of a central Arizona courthouse on Tuesday, when hundreds gathered to hear Eric Mueller offer a heart wrenching tribute to his sister, who died last month. The 26-year-old aid worker's death was confirmed on February 10 by her family and U.S. officials following her capture by the jihadis in Syria in August 2013. Before the crowd, her brother offered a poignant message to his sister when he told her: 'You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world.' Mr Mueller encouraged those in attendance to live as his best friend and sister had, by reaching out to others who were suffering.

Friends said 26-year-old Kayla Mueller (pictured left and right) was tireless in her efforts to improve others' lives and said she represented the best of humanity . In the first public comments he has made since her death, he said: 'Only now will you be able to see how much you truly did for this world by looking down on it. You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world,' USA Today reported. He went on to implore the crowd to help those who are struggling - a belief his sister had dedicated her life to. 'If you see someone struggling, see somebody upset, go give them a hug. It will make the community stronger. That's all it's going to do.' His father, Carl Mueller, stood up immediately after his son finished speaking and hugged him tightly at the bottom of the stage. Friends, family and strangers wore pink ribbons on their shirts as they listened to speakers reflect on her life and work. Strangers and friends dropped off cards and wrote messages for a scrapbook, calling her an angel and saying she represented the best of humanity. Miss Mueller's friends set up tables to accept canned goods and money for the needy, saying that was what she would have wanted. 'She was a saint,' said Rebecca Dunn, who attended high school with her. 'I'm hoping someone can take on her legacy. There was nothing she couldn't do.'

Churches and community groups in her hometown of Prescott, the former territorial capital of Arizona, organized the candlelight memorial. As it opened, a live band sang 'He Who Began A Good Work in You,' a song that Miss Mueller's mother, Marsha, used to sing to her as a child. Her family sat in the front row, clasping hands and wiping tears from their eyes. In the crowd, people raised their hands, closed their eyes and sang along. Pastor Ron Merrell said he was hopeful the community that gathered would give hope and love to Miss Mueller's family, and bring light into darkness - 'something that Kayla Mueller was good at.' From Prescott, she helped raise awareness of HIV and AIDS, and she volunteered for the overnight shift at a women's shelter. Her father Carl holds a candle during the ceremony.

"Surrey County Council chief executive David McNulty defended his £215,000-a-year salary because of his job's 'tough responsibilities' A council chief has defended his £215,000-a-year taxpayer-funded salary because of his job’s tough ‘responsibilities’. Surrey County Council chief executive David McNulty told workers he could justify being paid £70,000 more than the Prime Minister because of the work that comes with his role, such as waste disposal and keeping the county’s buses running on time. According to an internal document seen by MailOnline, Mr McNulty’s huge pay was called into question by one of his own workers during an online ‘ask me anything’ session in November. A council worker, using the name Coraline, asked the chief executive: ‘Dear Mr McNulty, why, in a time of cuts, are we paying some staff posts, including yours, more than the Prime Minister gets paid?’ David Cameron is paid £142,000 a year. Mr McNulty replied: ‘Hello Coraline. I do get paid a lot of money. The council uses external advice and benchmarking to set this salary. ‘The reason the council sets it at this level is because of the responsibilities involved. ‘These include a budget of £1.7bn providing services to 1.1m residents.’ Council workers reacted with fury to Mr McNulty’s defence of his pay. One enraged Surrey County Council worker, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘I find the chief executive’s salary laughable. Justifying his wages due to the amount of public he serves and budget he is accountable for is not comparable to David Cameron. ‘Our PM has the interest of 65million people and a multi-billion pound budget serving and protecting this country’s welfare and security. ‘In these times of austerity Mr McNulty has kicked off another initiative of asking Surrey to recycle one extra plastic bottle per week which will save £200K per year. ‘I can think of a quicker way for Surrey to meet its target and that's not by throwing away one bottle of Evian.’ A council worker asked Mr McNulty how he could defend being paid tens of thousands of pounds more than Prime Minister David Cameron . As well as his huge salary, Mr McNulty is in line for a one-off £100,000 bonus if he meets ‘performance-related targets’ by 2018. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘A council chief executive certainly has some important responsibilities, but it's no surprise that residents in Surrey wonder if they quite equate to those of the Prime Minister. ‘Big pay packets and perks for the top brass are especially questionable when there has been pay freezes and even cuts across the rest of the public sector. Senior salaries have to be brought under control, so that councils can focus resources on frontline services.’ Earlier this year MPs challenged the leader of Surrey County Council, David Hodge, to justify 60 per cent pay rises for councillors and senior members of the council while opposing legislation that would have upped poorest-paid workers to a £7.65 an hour wage. Labour MP Simon Danczuk asked Mr Hodge: ‘Why would you oppose giving the poorest paid workers a living wage and yet increase your own salary by 60 per cent and give a load of cash to the chief officers?’ At the time, Mr Hodge said lower paid staff had seen their wages increase. A council spokesman said: ‘This response did not seek to compare the two salaries but rather pointed out that the role had been assessed independently from the Chief Executive based on the fact that he has responsibility for a budget of £1.7bn, has guided the county council to achieving savings of £260m in the past four years and is now steering it to a further £250m savings over the next five years.’","Surrey County Council chief asked why he deserves £215,000-a-year salary .

"Humans may be staying inside for the frigid temperatures of the polar vortex, but the gust of arctic weather has brought unexpected guests to New York City. Seven snowy owls have been spotted this year in the city, which reached a 60-year low of 1F for February 20 on Friday morning. The birds are generally seen along the water in Brooklyn and Queens, but one was found on Governor's Island off the southern tip of Manhattan, according to DNA Info. A snowy owl was cited on Governor's Island and the park's staff asked for New Yorkers to help name the bird . A spokesman for the island said that it is the first time that snowy owls have been seen at the site, which is accepting proposals for what to name the animal. The arrival of the white-feathered owls, which are native to Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia, comes as air from Russia moved over the North Pole and has pushed south into the US. Temperatures in Embarrass, Minnesota, slid down to -41F on Thursday. The cold front, dubbed the Siberian Express, has brought single-digit temperatures as far south as Georgia as well as bringing arctic birds to the US. The owls, which are native to Canada, Scandinavia and northern Russia, arrive as the Siberian Express has brought a front of arctic air to the US . Snowy owls are carnivorous and experts advise against approaching the predators, who mostly eat lemmings, rodents and fish, according to National Geographic. Unlike many other owls, they are active both during the day and at night. This year's snowy owl sightings follow on dozens of the birds appearing in New York during last year's polar vortex. A group of owls is called a parliament.

"The search for missing three-year-old William Tyrell has taken flight this week, with authorities in dozens of far-reaching countries joining the cause. NSW Crime Stoppers have urged Crime Stoppers websites in 26 countries to post a message about William's abduction last year, urging anybody with information on the case to contact Australian police. The plea has been answered by places as far-flung as Europe and America posting articles for three-year-old William, who went missing from his home in grandmother's home on the NSW north coast on September 12, reports the Sunday Telegraph. Scroll down for video . NSW Crime Stoppers have urged Crime Stoppers websites in 26 countries to post a message about William's abduction, urging anybody with information to contact Australian police . NSW Crime Stoppers CEO Peter Price said they're expecting a plethora of other countries to jump on board. 'We're using the global crime stoppers network to broaden the communications appeal relating to his disappearance,' Mr Price said. 'We're hoping that somebody might recognise him.' While the global call to action may be helpful, NSW Homicide Squad detective Gary Jubelin said there is no evidence to suggest William had been taken overseas. The global campaign comes as the parents of missing three-year-old William Tyrell have issued a heartfelt plea to find their son after he vanished without a trace five months ago. The Tyrell family  issued a heartbreaking letter revealing William's toys remained untouched and that everyday since he disappeared had been a living nightmare. 'We wake up every day hoping this nightmare will be over. We desperately miss William, he's our baby boy; our funny, cheeky, gorgeous boy,' they said.

The letter, given to Daily Mail Australia by police, goes on to say their family home is too quiet without him. 'William's Spiderman toys remain untouched and there is such a huge hole in hearts,' they wrote. 'Walking past his bedroom is painful beyond words and having to do the day to day activities just reinforces that. 'Our sadness is overwhelming, as parents you wish for your children to have a long, happy and loving future. We desperately want that for our little William. 'We desperately want our little boy home where he belongs.' William was abducted from the yard of his grandmother's home in Kendall on the NSW north coast on September 12 last year wearing his favourite Spiderman costume. The family's heartfelt plea comes as detectives searching for the young boy vowed they would be looking to interview everyone within a kilometre of his grandmother's home. The latest move from police is a clear sign they are upping the intensity of the investigation and now believe he was abducted, The Australian reports. 'This is not a little boy lost story. This is not a child that wandered off. We think there's been human intervention,' NSW Police Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin said. Detectives haven't ruled out the possibility that the person responsible for abducting William loitered outside his grandmother's home before snatching the three-year-old as soon as he was alone. Police now want to speak to everyone that was in a 1km radius of the home between 10am and 11am that day. 'This is not a public appeal. We're saying: 'If you're in there, you'd better come forward',' Inspector Jubelin said. 'If you were in the area and did not come forward, we would have grave concerns and a certain amount of suspicion would be attached. 'It's a huge coincidence that you have a situation where a young boy has been unsupervised, only for a very short moment, and someone has come into contact with him at the time,' he told AAP, noting how quiet the street is. NSW Police Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin has taken over the case and warned police would speak to everyone within a 1km radius of where William went missing .

After five long months of investigation, police say that William Tyrell was abducted and did not simply wander off and become lost from his grandmother's home . To reinforce the point police believed the three-year-old was abducted Inspector Jubelin described it as a 'ground zero operation' and that they were basically starting the investigation from scratch again. He maintained that police would now 'consider every possibility' and 'everyone's a suspect'. As opposed to a normal appeal for public information, anyone who fits the criteria and doesn't come forward will attract police suspicion. 'If they don't come forward to police, we would have some concern and attach a certain amount of suspicion to anyone that doesn't want to help police in an investigation of this nature,' Det Insp Jubelin said. Detectives haven't ruled out the possibility that the person responsible for abducting William loitered outside his grandmother's home before snatching the three-year-old as soon as he was alone . Meanwhile concerned locals and two psychics have joined the hunt for the abductor in Australia's most baffling missing child case, sending police a photograph of a mystery man and a drawing of the possible kidnapper. The photograph of a man with folded arms standing near police, described as 'pale, lanky and walks with a limp', has emerged as fresh evidence in the search. The local searcher who photographed 'the man with the folded arms' decided to speak out but as the mystery of missing toddler  entered its fifth baffling month. She sent a photograph of the man to police late last year, but has not heard back. A psychic has also hand drawn a cryptic picture of the man she believes may have abducted William. This was the scene of the search for missing William Tyrell near Kendall on the NSW Mid North Coast last September for nine days after he went missing . NSW Mid North Coast locals (pictured) join in the search last September for missing William Tyrell . While NSW police would not confirm whether they were working on leads from the clairvoyants, police around Australia have a long history of working with clairvoyants on missing persons and murder cases. Mid North Coast locals assembled on day one of the search for William after he vanished on September 12 from his grandmother's home at Kendall, 35km south of Port Macquarie, say five months on they still want to help in the search for the little boy. William was wearing his favourite Spiderman costume and playing with his younger sister in the yard at their grandmother's home during a visit to Kendall with their mother from Sydney, when he disappeared. Fears that the little boy may have wandered off into the bush gave way to graver doubts as police scoured fields, dams and roads through the nearby forest for clues. This is the street where William Tyrell was visiting his grandmother when he vanished last September . Police and SES volunteers scoured the bush and forest for clues to William Tyrell but found nothing . Last month police searched this house (pictured) in Bonny Hills, NSW, for traces of William but have yet to release details of the forensic analysis . Kendall's tiny community rallied around William's desperate family and Mid North Coast residents turned up to help with the search. A command post was set up and volunteers provided food for the searchers. AS the days rolled by, police admitted William's chances of survival if he had wandered off alone were slim. They widened the search, theorising that the boy may have been thrown from a vehicle after being abducted. Police Strike Force Rossann engaged hundreds of volunteers in the search of bushland around the home for any sign of William. Anyone with information about William's disappearance should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. The community flocked to Kendall to help in the search and got behind William Tyrell's desperate family who still have no idea where the little boy could be . Psychics are sending their readings and drawings into police to try and solve the baffling mystery which has been going on for five months since the initial fruitles search (above) at Kendall in NSW .","Parents of William Tyrell issued a heartfelt plea to help find their son .

"A 46-year-old man says he is 'outraged' after allegedly being kicked out of a Nottingham nightclub for being 'too old'. Chris Pettifor says he was trying to get into heavy-metal night Phlebas at Bar Eleven in Nottingham city centre on Tuesday when the incident happened. The casino cashier says he was with a group of friends when two doormen approached and told him he couldn't come inside. Chris Pettifor, 46, a casino cashier, was trying to get into heavy-metal night Phlebas at Bar Eleven in Nottingham (pictured), when he says two doormen told him he was 'too old' to come in . He said: 'When I got home I thought, 'how dare they?' It is embarrassing. I was flabbergasted. 'I didn't bother arguing because if you've been refused, there's no point. I just left. 'I know the place is very young and you don't tend to see anyone over the age of 21 in there, but that shouldn't make a difference.' Mr Pettifor, from West Bridgford, Nottingham, was heading to the alternative night which features indie, rock, house, punk, drum'n'bass and hip hop music with  group of friends. His companions say they are also outraged over the way he was treated. Melody O'Keefe, 32, said she is disgusted in the way her friend of two years has been treated. She said: 'There's a big group of us and we're proud that we're all of different ages. 'The situation is absolutely terrible. I've checked to see whether there was an age limit to the club night but I couldn't find anything.' Rob Symes, who runs Phlebas which is described as plaiying a mix of indie, rock, house, punk, drum'n'bass and hip hop music, said Mr Pettifor could have been turned away 'for any number of reasons' Rob Symes, who runs the Phlebas club night, said: 'The only two people who could have spoken to Chris were the doorman and it is their job to make sure everyone is safe. 'He could have been turned away for a number of reasons. I don't know anything about the man.' Manager Michael Freeborn added : 'As I have no experience of Chris Pettifor, having never met him, I simply cannot offer a reason as to why he was rejected but I can state with utter confidence it would not have been due to his age.'","Chris Pettifor, 46, was trying to get into club for heavy-metal night Phlebas .

"Dementia patients will receive a diagnosis within six weeks, David Cameron will pledge today (file image) Dementia patients will receive a diagnosis within six weeks, David Cameron will pledge today. Britain will also lead the search for a cure, with over £300million of taxpayers’ money invested in research, and all 1.3million NHS staff are to receive training in handling the condition. The Prime Minister branded dementia one of the ‘greatest enemies of humanity’, insisting care for sufferers and efforts to find better treatments must be stepped up. As part of this effort, Mr Cameron said people presenting with symptoms should not be kept waiting for treatment because of delayed diagnoses. GPs’ diagnosis rates have increased from 42 per cent to 59 per cent in the last three years, but some patients are still waiting up to six months for a full assessment. The Prime Minister said this would ‘no longer be tolerated’, insisting there should be an average wait of no more than six weeks for diagnosis. ‘Dementia is one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime, and I am proud that we are leading the world in fighting it,’ he said. ‘Because of the growing strength of our economy, we can invest in research and drug development, as well as public understanding, so we defeat this terrible condition and offer more hope and dignity for those who suffer.’ Experts warn that unless more effective treatments are found, the number of over-60s living with Alzheimer’s and related conditions will more than double from 850,000 to two million over the next 35 years, putting a huge strain on the NHS and social services. And as well as devastating families, dementia already costs the economy up to £21billion a year in treatment costs and lost productivity. There are plans to invest over £300million in UK research and medical innovation. Overall, annual investment in research in this country is expected to double by 2025. David Cameron said people presenting with symptoms should not be kept waiting for treatment because of delayed diagnoses . The Government will also set up an international dementia institute in England within five years, helping to make the UK a world leader for research on dementia and medical trials. There are also efforts to improve the care of dementia patients. All 1.3million NHS staff will be required to undergo special training in order to provide the best possible standards in care. Over 400,000 have already taken part in such training. The Government’s world dementia envoy, Dennis Gillings, said: ‘We have momentum. Awareness of dementia is increasing and action is being taken, and that will ensure the condition is managed far better in our society.’","Britain to lead search for a cure for dementia, David Cameron will reveal .

"A Missouri man and 'spiritual leader' of an alleged cult denies killing his wife on an upcoming episode of CBS's '48 Hours.' In CBS's '48 Hours: Fall From Grace,' television news reporter Troy Roberts investigates the mystery surrounding the death of Bethany Deaton, 27, who was reportedly involved in an alleged religious cult. It has been more than two years since the body of 27-year-old Deaton was found in the backseat of a minivan with a plastic bag over her head and a goodbye note in Longview Lake. Denied: Tyler Deaton (right), the leader of an alleged cult, denies killing his 27-year-old wife, Bethany (left), in an upcoming episode of CBS's '48 Hours' as her death has remained a mystery for more than two years. But the circumstances surrounding the woman's death remain a mystery. In an upcoming episode of '48 Hours' -- airing Saturday -- Roberts aims to determine whether an alleged religious cult was responsible for the young woman's death. Deaton, who wed the alleged cult's leader Tyler Deaton just two months earlier, was found with prescription sleeping pills in reach that night in October 2012, and the medical examiner declared her death a suicide. Body: Thee body of 27-year-old Bethany was found in the backseat of a minivan with a plastic bag over her head and a goodbye note in Longview Lake . 'Murderous:' Tyler admitted that his relationship with his wife was strained and let out a laugh before denying being 'murderous' A little more than a week later, Bethany's friend Micah Moore, also a member of the alleged cult, confessed to her murder, claiming Tyler ordered him to do it. Details about the alleged cult surfaced, and Tyler was reported to have been the ringleader. CBS reports that Tyler told members of the alleged cult, also known as 'Community,' what to wear, when to eat, and even controlled romantic relationships among the group. 'They did as they were told. They didn't make decisions on their own,' Penny Cole, a detective with the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, said. Ringleader: Details about the alleged cult surfaced, and Tyler (center) was reported to have been the ringleader, ordering the members into sexual relationships with himself and one another . Assault: A member of the alleged cult Micah Moore reportedly told a detective that he and several men in the house had been sexually assaulting Bethany and were afraid she might tell someone about it . More secrets began to spill out in the case as it was revealed that the Community members were in sexual relationships with one another, including Tyler with other men, Rolling Stone reports. Moore reportedly told a detective that he and several men in the house had been sexually assaulting Bethany and were afraid she might tell someone about it. A murder charge against Moore was recently dismissed, but investigators became suspicious about the circumstances surrounding the newly-wed's death. '[Bethany] was a nurse and pretty successful,' Susan Zirinsky, '48 Hours' executive producer, told CBS. 'The drugs she took were an over-the-counter sleeping medication. She's a nurse, she has access to all kinds of narcotics.' Suspicious: A murder charge against Moore was recently dismissed, but investigators became suspicious about the circumstances surrounding the newly-wed's death . Suicide: Bethany, who wed Tyler just two months earlier, was found with prescription sleeping pills in reach that night in October 2012, and the medical examiner declared her death a suicide . Zirinsky also noted that Bethany's eyes were open when police found her body, which is unlikely in an overdose situation, and authorities say that she had been writing 'thank you' notes to her wedding guests at the time of her death. In the show's preview, Roberts asked Tyler if he believed the group he led was a cult, he said no and claimed that no one with the 'qualifications' to make that statement have done so. 'My gift, and something that is also a curse, I can be electric and magnetic.' Tyler said. 'I can affect people.' Tyler admitted that his relationship with his wife was strained and let out a laugh before denying being 'murderous.' CBS's '48 Hours: Fall From Grace' airs Saturday at 10pm ET/PT on CBS.","Tyler Deaton, an alleged cult leader, said on an episode of CBS's '48 Hours' that he did not kill his wife, 27-year-old Bethany Deaton .

"It could hardly be a more typical weekend scene: a family stroll for mum, dad, baby and a proud grandmother. But this is no typical family. Look closer and you'll recognise the smart lady in black as broadcaster and campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen. And the smile hides a sadness – as the casually dressed group have come together in circumstances that are more rancorous than relaxed. For although Dame Esther was delighted when her second grandchild, Teddy, arrived, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that he is the result of an affair and an acrimonious marriage breakdown. Campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen seen walking with  her son Dr Joshua Wilcox (pushing his new baby Teddy) and his partner, Kelly-Ann Jones . The baby's father is Dame Esther's son, Dr Joshua Wilcox. His partner, Kelly-Ann Jones, a married mother of two, left her husband for Joshua after they had an affair. The split has reportedly left the deserted husband in a state of devastation. This might explain why the broadcaster, who was married to the late film-maker and BBC executive Desmond Wilcox, has been rather reticent about the new addition to the family, commenting only briefly to confirm he will be known as Teddy. Neither parent has been willing to speak in public so far, but a close friend, who knows the details of the marriage break-up, says the pair met when junior doctor Joshua, 34, and Kelly-Ann, 36, began working at Torbay Hospital where she was an Accident and Emergency nurse. The friend suggests that Kelly-Ann fell pregnant just months into the new relationship. The campaigner's second grandchild, Teddy is the result of an affair and an acrimonious marriage breakdown . Kelly-Ann Jones (right) and her husband Neill McArthur (left) were childhood sweethearts and he has been left devastated by split . Joshua and Kelly-Ann now live together with Teddy and her children in a smart penthouse flat in a crescent of period townhouses overlooking the marina in Torquay. It is understood that the decision was supported by Dame Esther, who has frequently highlighted the anguish suffered by grandparents who are denied access to their grandchildren and then lose touch. Kelly-Ann was clearly delighted at the pregnancy and proud that her new son bears the Wilcox surname. Within three days of his birth she posted her new son's photograph on Facebook, writing: 'Our new little bundle, Edward Desmond Rantzen Wilcox 'Teddy'. At a not so little nine pounds nine ounces.' Kelly-Ann's mother, Wendy Bodnar, also posted a picture of the child. If Dame Esther appears to be in a forgiving mood, it is perhaps understandable as this is not the first time an extra marital affair has featured in her family life. She was a reporter at the BBC, working alongside Desmond Wilcox's wife Patsy, when she began an affair with Wilcox, who was then her boss. Traumatised by her husband's affair, Patsy became so ill she was admitted to Charing Cross Hospital. Dame Esther moved into the home Patsy had shared with Wilcox to help look after his children. Patsy refused to divorce Wilcox, only eventually agreeing when, after a number years, Dame Esther became pregnant. She and Wilcox married in 1977 and had three children, Rebecca, Miriam and Joshua. Desmond Wilcox died in 2000. The broadcaster and founder of Childline with her son Joshua Wilcox at a dinner in London in 2001 . For one person, however, the events of the past few months have been less than happy. For Neill McArthur, Kelly-Ann's husband and childhood sweetheart, news of her affair came as a shock. His friends say he had believed his marriage was stable until she became increasingly distant. He moved out of the family home last March, assuming he would return home when the pair had settled their differences. In August, Kelly-Ann agreed to meet him and – accompanied by her mother – told her husband that she was pregnant with Joshua's child. They had been married since 2001, and a family source said: 'Neill absolutely worshipped Kelly-Ann. 'She wanted nice things in life and he bust a gut to make sure he could provide them. 'It wasn't enough though. Kelly-Ann bored easily and she became tired of Neill. Joshua was the bright new thing and she loves mentioning his surname. 'Neill is now slowly moving on with his life,' says a friend. 'He has met someone new but finds it very difficult to accept another man is living with the woman who is still, technically, his wife and helping to bring up his children. 'But he is glad to be free of her now. Part of him feels people should know just how badly Kelly-Ann has behaved and what she is really like. 'The other part loves his children too much to denigrate their mother so publicly. It has all been incredibly hard for Neill.'","Dame Esther Rantzen spotting on family outing with grandchild Teddy .

"An investigation into firefighters having sex on their truck at California's fire academy has revealed a frat boy lifestyle that included drinking on duty and using state cellphones for hundreds of sexually explicit photos. A battalion chief now on trial for murder also slapped a female cadet on the buttocks and was not disciplined, according to newly released documents. The complaints about the Fire Academy in Ione came after a $2 million investigation that started in May after academy instructor Orville Fleming was charged with murder in the death of a former escort who became his girlfriend. An investigation after the murder charge against Orville Fleming, now 56, in the death of his girlfriend and former escort Sarah June Douglas, 26. New information shows he also slapped a female cadet on the behind . Fleming has pleaded not guilty to killing 26-year-old Sarah June Douglas. His estranged wife told Sacramento County sheriff's investigators and reporters that she watched a video that showed the victim having sex with her husband and other firefighters on fire trucks. She also alleged that the firefighters had sex with prostitutes. Investigators never found the purported video. However, their work led to the new allegations against the academy in Ione, which are contained in four complaints brought by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Assistant Chief Mike Ramirez was fired last month for drinking alcohol and allowing others to drink on duty. He also is accused of failing to take action when Fleming allegedly slapped the female cadet's behind. The public records say Fleming, now 56, displayed a partially nude photo of the victim to Ramirez, although the name of his late girlfriend was redacted. Investigators did not find the purported video of Ms Douglas and firefighters having sex on a fire truck, but discovered a series of alleged offences that led to the current complaints . Ramirez also failed to act when Fleming made sexual comments to another female firefighter, or when a third firefighter showed sexually explicit photographs in the academy's dormitory area, according to documents. The assistant chief also is accused of misusing his state vehicle, being insubordinate and lying during the investigation, among other allegations. His attorney Gary Messing said that the allegations are 'overblown' or lack merit, according to the Sacramento Bee. He said that investigators had to find offences after investing time and money looking into the academy. Sixteen workers were put on administrative leave in December after preliminary investigation results were received by CAL Fire. Three other firefighters are also challenging their discipline. Battalion Chief Bryant Camarena is appealing the demotion he received for showing colleagues some of the hundreds of sexual images he had on his state-issued cellphone, among other alleged violations. His new position is fire apparatus engineer, which pays $1,800 less per month. Sixteen workers, 15 of whom were instructors, faced discipline after an investigation revealed drinking and sharing sexually explicit photos at the Fire Academy in Ione (pictured) Fire captains Michael T. Roe and Daniel Valenzuela are appealing their demotions for consuming alcohol and tolerating others' drinking on duty. Valenzuela also is accused misusing a state vehicle to return drunken cadets to the academy and displaying sexual photographs on his cellphone. He also reportedly received a link to a 'sex club for swingers' on his cell phone from one of the captains. Roe is also accused of failing to aid a cadet who became so drunk he vomited and passed out at a bar. The captain was suspended for a 60-day stretch that ends April 11 and Valenzuela was suspended for 30 days. Both were demoted to fire apparatus engineer. Their union is representing the firefighters, though President Mike Lopez and spokesman Terry McHale declined comment Friday. Information about the discipline of CAL Fire employees became public following a Public Records request (file photo) Neither Ramirez nor Camarena responded to requests for comment made through the union. The complaints became public when the four employees appealed their punishments to the State Personnel Board. They are among 16 employees who faced discipline from the investigation. One resigned, a second employee was fired and the others were suspended, demoted or had their pay reduced. Fifteen of the 16 were instructors at the Fire Academy in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento. Department spokeswoman Janet Upton also declined comment, citing the ongoing appeals process. Fleming was arrested following a two-week manhunt after Ms Douglas' body was discovered in the home they shared. He is next scheduled to appear in court in March.","Orville Fleming, 56, charged with murdering girlfriend Sarah  Douglas, 26 .

"Parts of a sickening video released by Islamic State militants that shows members of the terror group beheading 21 Coptic Christians have been faked, experts have claimed. The footage, which lasts five minutes, shows the Egyptian Christians dressed in jumpsuits being marched one by one along a lonely beach, each held by a fighter clad in black. The captives, their faces uncovered, are made to kneel before being forced to lie down. The masked jihadists then behead them simultaneously. While experts believe the men were killed by the terrorists, questions have been raised over whether some scenes - including one where the militants appear to be 7ft tall - have been manipulated. Scroll down for video . Doctored? The executioners appear to be seven-foot tall in this still taken from the sickening footage . Experts believe that the scene of ISIS terrorists marching 21 Coptic Christians to their death was faked . It is believed the actual murders were filmed in a different location and the sea was added at a later stage . There are also doubts as to whether the men were all murdered on the beach and whether they were all killed at the same time. It is thought sections of the footage might have been shot on a 'green screen' in a studio - a technique used in Hollywood blockbusters - and that the beach background was added at a later stage. Veryan Khan,  of the Florida-based Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, told Fox News that there are several technical mistakes in the video that show it was manipulated. She said that in the shot of the terrorists marching their prisoners along the beach, the jihadis appear to be 7ft tall - towering as much as two feet above their victims. This observation was supported by Hollywood director Mary Lambert who described it as the shot with the 'really tall Jihadists and the dwarf Christians.' Ms Khan added that the terrorist who speaks in the clip - dubbed 'Jihad Joseph' - appears much bigger than the sea in some shots, while his head looks out of proportion to his body. The sickening image of blood in the sea is believed to have been created using special effects . Ms Khan explained that this meant it was likely he had been filmed indoors and the sea scene, believed to be in northern Libya, had been placed behind him at a later stage. Meanwhile,  Lambert said that the scene that apparently shows the sea turning red with the blood of the beheaded men 'was obviously special effects'. The experts claimed that only a few Jihadis would have been on the beach along with a  'less talented crew' than the ones responsible for some of the group's more high-production videos. Earlier this week, local media reported that militants from the Islamic State and Ansar Al-Sharia were understood to have rounded up dozens of farm workers in the wake of bombings by Cairo. It raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution in what is being seen as ISIS's bid to announce its presence in a new region where it is gaining influence. Initial reports said seven men had been seized, but that figure had risen to more than 35 by mid-afternoon yesterday, according to The Libya Herald. It came as Egypt blitzed ISIS training camps, weapons stockpiles and fighters in two waves of air strikes following the gruesome murder of captured Egyptian workers. Meanwhile, the Egyptian government called for the US-led coalition to also target ISIS in Libya.","Isis released a video last week showing the murder of 21 Coptic Christians .

"The man accused of setting off a small explosion last month that rattled nerves because of its proximity to a Colorado NAACP office says he was in a rage over his financial problems and was actually targeting his accountant's office, according to court documents filed Friday. Thaddeus Murphy, 44, told federal agents he made the pipe bomb out of a shotgun shell and fireworks fuses, the records said. He said he was angry because the accountant wouldn't return his phone calls or give him back his tax records. But while a sign for the accountant's business was still on the wall of the building, it has been closed for 20 years, according to the president of the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP. The NAACP, which has been at the site since 1985, and a barbershop are the only tenants in the building. Financial fury: Thaddeus Murphy of Colorado Springs, Colorado Murphy has been arrested in connection with the explosion at a building in Colorado Springs on january 6 . Henry D. Allen Jr., president of the local NAACP chapter, expressed skepticism about the accountant version Friday, but would not say whether he believed his organization was the target. 'He targeted somebody in this building and in my estimate it was not the tax people,' Allen said. 'Does anyone really think this guy is going to admit to this?' Murphy has been charged with arson of a building and being a felon in possession of a firearm. At a hearing Friday in Colorado Springs, U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Hegarty ordered him held without bond pending another hearing next week. Murphy, wearing a white T-shirt, said nothing. He will be appointed a federal public defender. Jeff Dorschner, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Denver, said investigators determined the bombing was not an act of terrorism. But, he added, ""We're also continuing our investigation to determine whether that confession is true."" On Friday afternoon, Murphy's weathered pickup truck and trailer still sat outside the duplex where he lives on a winding street of modest apartment buildings in northern Colorado Springs. No one answered the door at his apartment. Nobody was hurt in the Jan. 6 explosion adjacent to a wall of Mr. G's Hair Design Studios, a barber shop that also shares the building with the NAACP in a mostly residential neighborhood. The crude device caused minor damage, failing to ignite a canister of gasoline set next to it. Even if the canister had ignited, the damage likely would have been minimal, the FBI said at the time. Still, the explosion gained widespread attention due to its closeness to the nation's oldest civil rights organization, and the FBI investigated it as a possible hate crime. National NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks said his organization appreciates local and federal authorities' swift efforts in arresting and charging a suspect. After the explosion: Police officers investigate the scene of an explosion at a building in Colorado Springs that houses a barber shop and the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP . 'We seek a continued investigation into the motive of the alleged suspect, and we look forward to the culmination of his criminal trial,'he said in a statement. 'We will remain vigilant as we continue fighting for civil and human rights in Colorado Springs and throughout the country.' Murphy told investigators he made the pipe bomb in his garage the night before the blast, using instructions he found online and materials from his work as a carpenter, according to court records. Murphy believed the accountant intentionally destroyed his tax records, and he told investigators he 'flipped out' because of his financial problems, the documents show. He said he wanted to send the accountant a warning. 'Murphy admitted the rationale for the pipe bomb was rage,' the documents say. Investigators searched his house and found at least seven firearms, which he is barred from having because he is a convicted felon. They also found a pack of road flares with one missing, a hobby fuse and 3 ½ pounds of commercially available explosive. Witnesses told investigators they saw a white Ford pickup near the scene of the blast. A Colorado Springs police detective spotted a matching vehicle February 10, which led authorities to Murphy. They watched him for several days before arresting him Thursday, according to the documents. Among other evidence, Murphy's cellphone records showed he had been close to the crime scene, and authorities found dog hair inside the pipe bomb that matched a brown pit bull living in Murphy's home, the documents show. Court records show Murphy's criminal history includes a felony theft conviction for which he was sentenced to five years in prison in 2009.","Thaddeus Murphy, 44, told federal agents he made the pipe bomb out of a shotgun shell and fireworks fuses, the records said .

"Spacewalking astronauts routed cables outside the International Space Station on Saturday, a tricky and tiring job that needs to be completed before new American-made crew capsules can dock. It was the first of three spacewalks planned for NASA astronauts Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Terry Virts over the coming week. Altogether, Wilmore and Virts have 764 feet of cable to run outside the space station. The longest single stretch, for installation Saturday, was 43 feet. Scroll down for video . Astronauts: Astronauts Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Terry Virts routed cables outside the International Space Station on Saturday in preparation for new American-made crew capsules . Preparations: Here, Wilmore begins the spacewalk Saturday morning  to wire the International Space Station in preparation for the arrival in July of an international docking port . Rewiring: The extensive rewiring is needed to prepare for NASA's next phase 260 miles up: the 2017 arrival of the first commercial spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the orbiting lab . 'Broadening my resume,' Virts observed as he started laying cable. NASA considers this the most complicated cable-routing job in the 16-year history of the space station. Equally difficult will be running cable on the inside of the complex. The extensive rewiring is needed to prepare for NASA's next phase 260 miles up: the 2017 arrival of the first commercial spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the orbiting lab. 'Pretty Cool:'Saturday's spacewalk was the first for Terry Virts, flight engineer, who arrived at the space station in late November, when he floated above the South Pacific he said 'Pretty cool' NASA: NASA is paying Boeing and SpaceX to build the capsules and fly them from Cape Canaveral, which hasn't seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011 . NASA is paying Boeing and SpaceX to build the capsules and fly them from Cape Canaveral, which hasn't seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011. Instead, Russia is doing all the taxi work — for a steep price. The first of two docking ports for the Boeing and SpaceX vessels — still under development — is due to arrive in June. Even more spacewalks will be needed to rig everything up. There were so many cables — up to 10 on Saturday to deal with — that NASA color-coded them. That helped the spacewalkers only so much; they expected a lighter blue for one of the lines. 'I worked up a lather on that one,' Wilmore informed Mission Control. After successfully attaching the first four cables, he added, 'I've got to cool down.' First of Three: Astronauts Wilmore (left) and Virts (right) began the first of three jobs Saturday morning in preparation of space taxis . Difficult: NASA considers this the most complicated cable-routing job in the 16-year history of the space station . It was the first spacewalk for Virts, who arrived at the space station in late November. He savored the moment as he floated out high above the South Pacific. 'Pretty cool,' he said. The second spacewalk will be Wednesday and the third on March 1. Spacesuit concerns stalled the work by a day. NASA wanted to make certain that the suits worn by Wilmore and Virts had reliable fan and pump assemblies. Two other fan-pump units failed aboard the space station in recent months and were returned to Earth earlier this month for analysis. Corrosion was discovered, the result of water intrusion from testing.","Spacewalking astronauts routed cables outside the International Space Station on Saturday .

"Police have put out a stern public warning after they were forced to launch a number of search and rescue operations which could have been prevented. A man on the Sunshine Coast who took a young boy for a ride on a blow-up toboggan in fast flowing waters was charged with public nuisance after the pair had to be rescued. The incident occurred at the same time as two boys were feared swept away in Queensland's floodwaters. They have since been found safe and well after a desperate search. Just after Marcia made landfall, locals took advantage of the conditions caused by the category five cyclone as youth seized the opportunity to boogie board in a flooded park while surfers weren't deterred by rough seas.

A 15-year-old boy has been rescued after clinging to a tree in the flood-swollen South Pine River in Queensland's southeast. Emergency service crews were called to the river between the Eatons Hill and Bunya shorelines at about 7pm on Saturday following reports the boy had been swept down the river and was clinging to a tree unable to move. The boy was located 'holding on to a tree in knee-depth rapidly flowing water unable to make his way back to the shoreline,' police said in a statement. He was kept under torchlight until a Queensland Fire and Emergency Services swift water rescue crew in an inflatable boat reached him and conveyed him to shore. The boy was treated by ambulance paramedics at the scene. Police continue to appeal to the public not to go into or play in floodwaters. Just yesterday, a 40-year-old local was charged with public nuisance. A young boy and the man were rescued at a property in Woodford on Saturday afternoon after they went tobogganing in a rapid waterway. Neither was injured, police said. The rescue operation was one of two police were involved with on the Sunshine Coast following localised flooding throughout central and southeast Queensland due to heavy rainfall from Cyclone Marcia.

"This shocking footage captures the moment a female police officer was punched in the face and had her head repeatedly smashed on the ground in a 'sickening' attack. Sergeant Kerry Lawrence was responding to reports of a burglary in Basingstoke when she was assaulted by Craig Radbourne, 25, who has now been jailed for three years. Radbourne can be seen handcuffed and apparently drunk in the back of a police car before protesting about why he was arrested and suddenly lashing out. He swings his hands into her face through the open car window and pushes Sgt Lawrence to the ground who can be heard yelling as her head is banged on the ground. Scroll down for video .

Sgt Lawrence can be seen lying on the floor (left) as her head is repeatedly smashed on the ground by Radbourne (in blue) The 25-year-old from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, pleaded guilty to a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm yesterday  at Winchester Crown Court. Judge Susan Evans QC described the footage as 'nothing short of sickening' and added that Sgt Lawrence was fortunate not to be more seriously hurt. The attack, which was filmed from the police officer's body camera on July 6 last year,  shows the officer lying down injured on the ground. She can be heard telling a colleague: 'He smashed my head off the ground'. Hampshire Police said the attack was a 'traumatic experience' for Sgt Lawrence, describing the assault as 'disgusting'. A spokeswoman for the force said: 'Radbourne was arrested by the officer on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He had been placed in handcuffs and into a police car before additional units arrived. 'However, before officers arrived, Radbourne managed to strike out at Sgt Lawrence, viciously attacking her and banging her head on the ground several times. He was subsequently re-arrested by other officers nearby and taken into police custody.' Body-cam footage shows Radbourne  handcuffed and apparently drunk in the back of a police car . He can be seen arguing about why he was arrested after Sgt Lawrence said he was drunk and disorderly .

They come to work knowing that their job has an element of risk, as part of their duty to protect the public. 'However assaulting an officer must never be seen as just part of the job. It is unacceptable. This was a disgusting attack on a member of my team, who works tirelessly to serve her community. 'I know it was an extremely traumatic experience for Sgt Lawrence and her family and it also had a significant impact on her team and others at Basingstoke Police Station. I am pleased that the courts have recognised the seriousness of this offence in the sentence passed today. 'Sergeant Lawrence is now back on full duties, which is to her absolute credit.' Sgt Lawrence is shown trying to defend herself in the attacked which has been described as  'nothing short of sickening' by Judge Susan Evans QC . The female police officer can be heard yelling as her head is repeatedly banged on the ground . Simon Hayes, police and crime commissioner for Hampshire, criticised the sentence as being lenient. He said: 'I am disappointed that Mr Radbourne has only been sentenced to three years in prison for the extremely violent assault against Sgt Kerry Lawrence. I would hope that he is made to serve the full sentence. 'Through this footage, the judges were able to see for themselves the aggravated abuse that Kerry suffered. BWV provides fairer and faster justice for victims and witnesses, which is why I have made a commitment to equipping every frontline officer and PCSO in Hampshire Constabulary with BWV over the next year - enabling the police to be more effective and transparent in protecting the public from harm.' John Apter, chairman of the Hampshire Police Federation, said: 'Police officers accept that they perform a dangerous and unpredictable job. I am pleased that the judge has given an appropriate sentence for this vicious and unprovoked attack on PS Lawrence.

"Dirty facilities on holiday is the main reason behind why Britons write negative holiday reviews - yet one in four of us fail to mention it while at the resort. Accommodation that was 'not as advertised' and 'poor location' are other key reasons that lead us to take to review sites in anger. The survey by Schofields Holiday Home Insurance also revealed that whilst 37 per cent of Britons who had a good experience on holiday left a positive review, 69 per cent of those who had a bad experience left a negative review. A quarter of Britons who aren't satisfied with their room say they don't bother to complain at the time . The survey set out to reveal the reasons why Britons leave bad reviews after going on holiday and discover whether people are more likely to leave good or bad reviews. A total of 2,172 UK citizens completed the survey, all of whom were aged 18 or over and had been on at least one holiday (either in the UK or abroad) within the last 12 months. There was an even ratio of male and female respondents. Initially, respondents were asked 'Have you ever had a good holiday?', to which 87 per cent stated that they had. Finding out your hotel was 'not what was advertised' leads many to leave a negative review on a website . When asked if they had subsequently left a positive review after a good holiday, 37 per cent  stated that they had. By comparison, of the 43 per cent of respondents who stated they had experienced a 'bad holiday', more than two thirds  had left a negative review, suggesting that reviews are more likely to be left after a negative experience than a positive one. All respondents who had left a negative review were asked where they had posted their review, with the option to select as many options as they wanted. Three quarters said they left the review with the 'booking agents/websites,' followed by 68 per cent who used 'social media' and 56 per cent who posted comments on an 'independent travel advice site'. Some hotel nightmares include this toilet that is missing its seat and an extremely dirty bathtub . These respondents were then asked if they had tried to address the problem(s) whilst on holiday by making a complaint, to which 26 per cent stated that they had not taken any measures to raise the issues during their holiday and potentially improve the circumstance during the time. Source: Schofields Holiday Home Insurance . Phil Schofield of Schofields Holiday Home Insurance said: 'It's really important to raise your concerns if you can and give the holiday provider a chance to put it right, if you have the opportunity. 'They might be able to change your accommodation or even upgrade you in order to make sure you have a good time. 'Most providers, from accommodation to catering, don't want you to have a rubbish time – and they definitely won't want you to leave a bad review. 'It's interesting to see the top reasons why people complain. They are all really good reasons, in all fairness, and they are things that can ruin a holiday. 'We would strongly advise that holidaymakers do their research before booking anything; check out the reviews that are already there before believing glossy pages or slick websites.'","Accommodation not being what was advertised is also a major gripe .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has foreshadowed a crackdown on abuse of welfare by terror supporters, following revelations that most home grown extremists were receiving welfare payments before fleeing to fight in the middle east. He said up to November, 55 of 57 Australians who had travelled to the Middle East to join the Islamist death cult had been on welfare, and that wasn't good enough. The announcement comes as a 23-year-old university student has emerged as the first known recruit from Western Australia to flee the country to join terrorist group Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has foreshadowed a crackdown on abuse of welfare by home-grown terrorists . 23-year-old Muhammed Sheglabo, who has fled overseas to fight for ISIS after telling his parents he was going camping . 'If you are fit enough to go overseas to fight for a terrorist organisation, surely you should not be abusing the welfare system back in Australia,' he told reporters in Darwin on Saturday. Mr Abbott will deliver his long-awaited national security statement on Monday, detailing what the government is doing to ensure Australians were safe abroad and at home. He said he would address numerous issues. 'One of them ... is the fact that for too long we have given people who don't have this country's interests at heart the benefit of the doubt,' he said. One of those would appear to be Man Haron Monis, the Iranian-born asylum seeker and perpetrator of the Sydney Martin Place siege. Monis, who had taken 18 people hostage, was shot dead when police stormed the cafe, ending the crisis that shocked Australia and made headlines worldwide. Two hostages died. Khaled Sharrouf is among 55 home-grown terrorists who received welfare payments after joining ISIS . Previously, Mr Abbott has said Monis had taken advantage of the Australian system and at every step of the way, he was given the benefit of the doubt. A joint NSW and commonwealth report on dealings with Monis before the siege is tipped to be released on Sunday, ahead of Mr Abbott's security statement. A media report says that's likely to result in a tougher stance on immigration requirements. Another high profile extremist among the 55 to be receiving welfare  while fighting in the Middle East is Khaled Sharrouf. Also in the spotlight is Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir which Attorney-General George Brandis said had for a long time been 'close to the edge'. 'We are concerned that Hizb ut-Tahrir is feeding a climate which makes it easier for terrorist recruiters to do their work,' he told ABC television on Friday. Hizb ut-Tahrir (Arabic for Party of Liberation) is an international Muslim organisation founded in 1953 with about 300 adherents in Australia. It advocates a single Islamic state, or caliphate, in the Middle East under Islamic law. The group is banned in many Middle East countries and also in Russia, Turkey, Pakistan and Germany but not in Australia, the US or UK. Nearly all of the 'home-grown' terrorists who have left the country to join IS were on welfare payments when they fled . It's never explicitly advocated violence but it rejects democracy and is equivocal on condemning terrorist violence. Senator Brandis said the government would do what needed to be done. 'In some circumstances monitoring and surveillance is the most efficacious tool, in some circumstances prohibition,' he said. The news comes after 23-year-old Perth University student Muhammed Sheglabo flew to the Middle East after telling his parents that he was going away on a camping trip in January. His family contacted the police when they were not able to contact him, and were reportedly heartbroken when they were informed of his decision. Sheglabo, who migrated with his family from Libya in 2010, is believed to be fighting with Islamic State forces in Al-Furat province, near the Syria-Iraq border. The Prime Minister is set to announce strict new laws to prevent the reign of extremist groups in Australia.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced most home grown jiahdi on welfare .

"NASCAR suspended Kurt Busch indefinitely Friday after a judge said the former champion almost surely choked and beat a former girlfriend last fall and there was a 'substantial likelihood' of more domestic violence from him in the future. In a stunning move two days before the season-opening Daytona 500, NASCAR said Busch would not be allowed to participate in any series activities until further notice given the 'serious nature of the findings and conclusions' made by a Delaware judge involving the driver known as The Outlaw. Family Court Commissioner David Jones concluded that it was more likely than not that Busch abused Patricia Driscoll by 'manually strangling' her and smashing her head into a wall inside his motorhome at Dover International Speedway last September. Scroll down for video . Kurt Busch, left, walks with his girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, after arriving for the NASCAR Sprint All-Star auto race at Charlotte Motor Speedway (file photo) NASCAR has suspended Busch (above) after a judge ruled he did likely 'strangle' his ex-girlfriend . 'Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made,' NASCAR said in a statement. Busch attorney Rusty Hardin said the driver will appeal, and NASCAR said it will be expedited. Still, SHR said Regan Smith will drive Busch's car in the Daytona 500 regardless of the appeal outcome. 'We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold,' Hardin said in a statement. 'It is important for everyone to remember that the Commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch.' Busch becomes the first driver suspended by NASCAR for domestic violence. Chairman Brian France had maintained the series would let the process play out before ruling on Busch's eligibility - and the series came down hard in finding that he committed actions detrimental to stock car racing and broke the series' behavioral rules. Travis Kvapil, who qualified second for Friday night's Truck Series race, was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013. NASCAR took no action against Kvapil. Chevrolet immediately suspended its relationship with Busch. A short time later, on the glass outside of Busch's garage stall at Daytona, someone had scrawled in black marker '#41 Ray Rice,' a reference to the former Baltimore Ravens running back whose own case of domestic violence dominated much of last year. Busch drives the No. 41 Chevrolet. Patricia Driscoll (left) arrives for her protective order hearing against Kurt Busch (right) at Kent County Family Court in December . Driver Kurt Busch, left, gives his new girlfriend Ashley Van Metre a kiss on Feb. 15 . The 36-year-old Busch has denied the alleged assault, which is the subject of a separate criminal investigation, but the judge said Driscoll's version of the incident was more credible than Busch's. Driscoll said she was never motivated to have Busch punished by NASCAR. 'I reported a crime, just like anybody else who has been abused should do, because no one is above the law,' Driscoll said. 'I'm very encouraged that NASCAR is taking steps to recognize that domestic violence is a serious issue, and I hope that we see them develop a very clear policy on it.' She urged NASCAR to develop a confidential reporting mechanism that partners of drivers could use to report domestic abuse without fear of threats or reprisals for coming forward. 'NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership and the broader industry that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated in the industry,' NASCAR executive vice president Steve O'Donnell said. 'I want to make it clear that any inference that there's a culture or a tolerance for this type of behavior is patently false.' Busch and Driscoll on the red carpet for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion's Awards in December 2013 . It was the weekend of the first elimination race, at Dover, where Driscoll alleged Busch assaulted her in his motorhome. She said she drove to the track out of concern for Busch, who sent her alarming text messages following a poor qualifying effort. She said the two argued in the bedroom section of the motorhome before he slammed her head against a wall three times. Driscoll did not file charges until November, and the Delaware attorney general has not decided if Busch will be charged. But Driscoll sought a no-contact order, and the couple spent four days over December and January in a Delaware court presenting their sides. At one point, he accused of her of being a trained assassin. Jones noted that Driscoll presented false testimony that conflicted with that of a chaplain who saw her immediately after the alleged assault and said he didn't see any marks or bruises on her. Jones nevertheless said he didn't believe Driscoll's false testimony amounted to perjury or intentional falsehood. The judge concluded that Busch did not appear to be a prototypical batterer who uses violence to subjugate or control, but that the incident instead was most likely a ""situational"" event in which Busch was unable to cope and to control his tendency to act out violently in response to stress and frustration, causing him to ""snap."" At the same time, however, Jones said he believes there's real possibility that Busch will lash out again. Jones added that because Busch has a propensity to lose control in response to disappointing or frustrating situations involving racing and that those who love him are likely to be around him at those times ""there is a substantial likelihood of acts of domestic violence by respondent against future intimate partners."" Busch's attorneys filed a motion Thursday asking Jones to re-open the hearing so that they can present testimony from three acquaintances of Driscoll who they say were previously reluctant to get involved but have now come forward to contradict statements Driscoll has made about her relationship with Busch. It is Busch's third career suspension. He was suspended in 2012 by NASCAR for threatening a reporter, and parked for the final two races of the 2005 season by Roush-Fenway Racing after he was pulled over by police in Arizona. He now races for SHR. The 2004 NASCAR champion has 25 career wins, but only one since 2011. It came last year, his first season with SHR, the team that helped resurrect his career. Team co-owner Gene Haas hand-picked Busch to drive a car paid for out of pocket by Haas because the machine tool manufacturer wanted to see a driver take his company to victory lane. Busch was fired at the end of 2011 by Roger Penske for a series of on- and off-track incidents, and he spent two seasons driving for low-budget teams before Haas extended the olive branch. Busch had been on a resurgence of sorts at SHR, which allowed him to compete in both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day last year. He finished sixth at Indianapolis last May and was named rookie of the race. But his season began to unravel late last summer as his performance tailed off. Although he made the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship, he was eliminated after the first round.","NASCAR has suspended Kurt Busch after a domestic abuse incident that allegedly took place last fall .

"Prince Harry (pictured) has decided never to fly a combat helicopter again . He once described his role as an Apache pilot fighting the Taliban as ‘the best experience ever’. But Prince Harry has now decided never to fly a combat helicopter again. The Prince, who spent five months in the cockpit of a gunship in Afghanistan, has opted to hang up his flying goggles, even though the Army is short of pilots. Prince Harry, 30, or Captain Wales as he is called in the Forces, was expected to return to the skies with the Army Air Corps after arranging the Invictus Games – the Olympic-style event for wounded service personnel held in London last year. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal he has told military top brass he wants to continue working with injured troops before returning next year to his parent regiment, the Blues and Royals. This summer Harry will join a team of injured soldiers as they walk across Britain in aid of the charity Walking With The Wounded. A senior source said: ‘Prince Harry has plotted his career path and he’s not going back to flying Apaches. 'Even though he loved the job in Helmand province and excelled in combat operations against the Taliban, he has effectively grounded himself. ‘A major factor was the amount of training he would be required to do to command an Army Air Corps squadron – a post that includes flying Apaches. 'He would also have needed to do a couple of rather draining desk jobs to prepare himself for such a leadership role. ‘Harry weighed this up and reached a decision. He knew it was no longer viable for him to go back to the Corps and try to climb that ladder. 'The opportunity for more Apache action had passed.’ Prince Harry, who is fourth in line to the throne, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Blues and Royals in April 2006. For security reasons he was refused permission to deploy to Iraq in 2007. The following year he secretly went to Afghanistan and served with a Household Cavalry reconnaissance unit until news of his presence leaked on foreign news websites and he was ordered back to Britain. Contrary to media reports at the time, he received no extra protection and was involved in many skirmishes with the enemy. Later in 2008 he transferred to the Army Air Corps in an attempt to become an Apache pilot. Action man: Prince Harry is pictured at the cockpit of his Apache in Helman province, Afghanistan in 2012 . In February 2012 he completed a £2.5 million training programme and was sent to Afghanistan as a co-pilot gunner in September that year. Five months later he was interviewed by the media and attracted controversy for suggesting he had killed insurgents, and for likening his participation in combat operations to playing computer games. Asked if he had killed, he replied: ‘Yeah, so lots of people have. Everyone’s fired a certain amount. If there’s people trying to do bad stuff to our guys we’ll take them out of the game. 'I’m not out here on a free pass.’ An Army spokesman said: ‘We would not comment on the future careers of any of our officers.’","Prince Harry, 30, has taken decision never to fly a combat helicopter again .

"Senator Jeff Flake's son and his young wife are suing Maricopa County Sheriff's office and Sheriff Joe Arpaio for $8million in damages claiming they 'constructed a conspiracy' to wrongfully indict the couple. Austin and Logan Flake, both 21, are seeking $4million  in damages each after they were initially charged in the deaths of 21 dogs who died from heat exhaustion while in their care last summer in Arizona. The couple's lawyer stated in a letter that the sheriff's office had a plot to 'harm their reputations by presenting false and misleading information', which caused 'irreparable injury to their good names and future prospects'. The Flakes case against Arpaio and the sheriff's office is centered around claims including malicious prosecution, conspiracy, abuse of process, negligence, defamation, false light invasion of privacy, and intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to their lawyer's statement. Scroll down for video . Austin (left) and Logan (right) Flake, both 21, are seeking $4million in damages each after they were initially charged in the deaths of 21 dogs who died from heat exhaustion while in their care last summer in Arizona . Austin (above far left), the son of Senator Jeff Flake (pictured far right with his wife Cheryl Flake, left), and his young wife Logan (right of Austin)  are suing Maricopa County and Sheriff Joe Arpaio for $8million in damages claiming they 'constructed a conspiracy' to wrongfully target the couple . The Flakes' attorney, Jack Wilenchik, said among the damages the couple have suffered from include Austin being kicked out of Brigham Young University, where he was attending school, after he was indicted on charges, according to ABC15. Even though the 21 felony counts and seven misdemeanor counts he and his wife were charged with were dismissed in December, Wilenchik said the university has not reinstated Austin. The lawyer also said that Arpaio was 'undeterred by the facts', and after conducting a rigged investigation, 'sent his detective in to lie to the grand jury'. The events unfolded in June 2014, when Logan's parents, Jesse Todd and Maleisa Hughes, asked her and Austin to care for the dogs in the kennel, Green Acre dog residence, operated out of their home while they went away to Florida. They found 21 canines dead which the sheriff's department investigators concluded likely died on June 20 from suffocation and heat exhaustion after being confined in a small room that measured eight by 12 foot. The Hughes told authorities that the air-conditioning was knocked out by a dog chewing through an electrical cord, but the investigators could not confirm that. In October, the Hughes were  indicted on 22 felony counts, seven misdemeanor counts and one count of fraud, but they were also dismissed in December a part from the count of fraud. KNXV abc15 .

The couple's lawyer stated in a letter that the sheriff's office had a plot to 'harm their reputations by presenting false and misleading information', which caused 'irreparable injury to their good names and future prospects' (above Logan) The charges against both couples were dropped because the case presented by prosecutors did not take into account potential problems with the air conditioning unit. However, the county attorney warned that new charges could be filed against them. The one count of fraud remains intact against the Hughes, alleging that dog owners were fraudulently led to believe their pets would be roaming free and playing with the Hughes' children in a spacious backyard. Instead, the pets were kept in a 'dog room' that was not shown to prospective customers on tours of the kennel.

When the bodies of the dogs were found, some of the owners claimed that they were initially told their pets had run away. Jacqueline Heath, who lost three dogs, told ABC that her home would never be the same. It still doesn't seem real that I'm never going to see these dogs again,' she told CBS as she broke down in tears. 'We don't have them running around. We're never going to have them to cuddle.' The dog owners claim that they were told the family would only board a few dogs at a time but a police investigation found more than two dozen dogs were in the small room together. 'Our clients were deceived, attorney John Schill told AZFamily. 'They were told their dogs would be boarded at a Disneyland-type facility, where the dogs would run free. 'In reality, it was 28 dogs crammed into a nine-by-twelve [foot] room, where they died.'

The Flakes' lawyers said that as tragic as this accident was, it was exactly that - a tragic accident, and never a crime.

"Anti-rape campaigners have slammed a 'terrifying' website which publishes articles and blog posts by men allegedly condoning the sexual assault of women by their husbands. Return of The Kings is an American website with more than 6,000 monthly subscribers and hundreds of men posting comments beneath articles composed by contributing writers. Among 'sexist' articles it has published is one titled Five Lines That Potential Wives Cannot Cross. Critics have blasted the post as 'amounting to an incitement of rape'. 'Terrifying': Anti-rape campaigners have slammed an article posted online which instructs men to map out 'red lines' for potential wives . The write defended the section titled 'You don't reject me, ever' as attempting to have 'humour value' and 'offer advice' The article, written by a former Australian columnist posting under the pseudonym Hesse Kassel, is a list of five rules the writer says men must impose in a relationship to ensure it succeeds. Among its guidelines is 'You don't reject me, ever' - instructing men never to allow prospective partners to refuse them sex. 'Under no circumstance can you accept the idea that she gets to choose if or when to satisfy you or choose to sabotage your joint fertility,' it reads. 'Only give sex when it suits you.  You control the time and frequency of sex, not her. 'The obvious exception to this is the first time you have sex. Typically she will control the timing of that for obvious reasons. 'From the second time onward, any poorly-reasoned denial is a red flag.' The article has been slammed as 'terrifying' and 'misogynistic' by campaigners shocked that such attitudes exist in modern society'. Siobhan Ames-Bell, who waived her anonymity after seeing her stepfather jailed for assaulting her to campaign on behalf of rape victims, said the article 'clearly' condoned rape. 'Saying something is all part of the thought process. The fact they believe this shows they can act on it. Siobhan Ames-Bell, who was raped by her stepfather, said the article incites sexual attacks . 'These should be monitored. Anybody who acts on these views has commited rape in my eyes. 'Sex is a choice . When both are not in consent it's rape.' Rape Crisis, the country's leading victim support charity, described the views presented in the article as 'terrifying'. 'This entire article is terrifying as is the idea that there is any sort of market for this kind of material in the 21st century,' said Katie Russell. 'The views expressed throughout are not only deeply outdated but also profoundly misogynistic. 'The writer unapologetically, aggressively and repeatedly advises men to enslave and dehumanise women. 'He is incredibly misguided and cynical in his apparent view that only a relationship or marriage based on power, control and abuse can ever endure. 'Most seriously and alarmingly of all, however, the first on the writer’s list of ‘rules’ amounts to an incitement to rape. 'Someone who ""refuses to take no for an answer"" from their partner and has sex with her or him anyway is a rapist.' The writer, who declined to give his real name, defended the article, saying: ''The post aims to have some humor value but also include useful advice. 'It was only my second blog post and I may or may not have achieved that aim. 'If you read the post carefully you will see that it doesn't say that a woman should be forced to comply. 'It merely says that a man should choose not to marry a woman who displays certain behaviors. 'The post did not incite, condone or so much as discuss rape, even in jest.' Almost 700 comments have been posted beneath the article on the website, the majority of which written by internet users claiming to be men and in support of StrongSloth's views. The website, which describes itself as 'a small but vocal collection of men in America today who believe men should be masculine and women should be feminine' has been criticised in the past for controversial content. Last November an article titled 'Five reasons to date a girl with an eating disorder' was accused of trivialising anorexia and bulimia by encouraging men to target sufferers as they 'cost less' and 'her obsession over her body will improve her overall looks'.

"Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children must give up their childcare payments from the government unless care is quarantined to the home, according to a new report. This hard-line approach to immunisation is part of the recommendations handed down by the Productivity Commission's report into childcare. The report warns that access to government rebates for childcare should only be handed out if the child is fully immunised in order to protect them from preventable diseases. Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children must give up their childcare payments from the government unless care is quarantined to the home, according to the Productivity Commission's report into childcare . While parents are required to vaccinate their children to receive benefits, they can seek exemptions if a doctor signs a form showing they understand the risks to their child if they don't get vaccinated. The Productivity Commission's report now recommends rebates 'be conditional on the child being fully immunised, unless care occurs in the child's home'. Childcare centres in NSW can ban children that are not immunised and other states are currently considering similar tough stances. 'The commission makes some very important suggestions in this area. I am open to everything in the report. I am not ruling anything in or out,' Social Services Minister Scott Morrison told the Sunday Telegraph.

'Kids deserve to grow up safe and healthy. I'm not comfortable with the idea of subsidising people who put kids' health at risk,' he said. 'Childcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with. Families who do the right thing by immunising their child shouldn't have to worry about whether their child is going to pick up a preventable illness at their childcare centre.'

"A huge gorilla showed off his impressive strength with a workout that put even the most committed gym-goers to shame. Kivu, a western lowland gorilla, did not let his size stop him as he climbed, swung and flexed in his own private gym. Using a wooden platform to hold on to he easily completed a set of pull-ups. Scroll down for video . Kivu completes a strong workout session using his wooden climbing frame at Paignton Zoo, in Devon . The huge primate then turned his hand to crunches, throwing himself backwards off the climbing frame, in Paignton Zoo, Devon, and pulling his legs in. The hilarious snaps were taken by photographer Chris Rockey. Mr Rockey, also from Paignton, said: 'One minute he was just sat there and then he started climbing and swinging.' Kivu arrived at the zoo in 2006. His keepers describe him as 'a very smart gorilla, who loves showing off'. After his arrival Royal Marines had to rebuild the frame to ensure it could withstand the strength and weight of the gorillas. The 13-year-old loves using it to show off, according to his keepers. The 13-year-old western lowland gorilla uses his arms to pull himself up so he's hanging upside down underneath the roof of the frame . Much like a human's pull-up the huge primate uses just his arms to lift all of his weight. An adult male gorilla can weigh up to 400lbs (181kg) A spokesman for Paignton Zoo said: 'Kivu is very playful. 'As well as his climbing frame, he also likes to sit inside large blue plastic barrels and glare at visitors close-up through the windows. 'It is wonderful to see the gorillas flex their muscles. We should respect the wild world and when you see Kivu like this it reminds you what superb creatures they are. 'It is one reason we have zoos, so people can see wild animals they wouldn't normally be able to and be utterly amazed at their size, strength, and character.' After hanging for a few minutes Kivu throws himself backwards while holding on to the wood tightly. Photographer Chris Rockey said: 'One minute he was just sat there and then he started climbing and swinging' Playful Kivu looks like he is enjoying being upside down as he tucks his legs behind him. The frame was rebuilt by Royal Marines so it could hold six large gorillas . An adult male gorilla can weigh up to 400lbs (181kg) and can grow up to 6ft (1.8m) tall. Paignton Zoo has a bachelor group, which has six of the critically endangered species in. Some of the gorillas may move on to be the dominant males in bachelor or family groups as part of a European breeding programme. The mesmerizing creature ends his workout on the top of the wooden structure, holding on to a piece of rope while he takes a breather .","Western lowland gorilla Kivu was pictured at Paignton Zoo, in Devon .

"A medical marijuana activist from Florida is accusing Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of attempted bribery after the congresswoman allegedly offered to back legalization if the man stopped criticizing her in public. At stake for Wasserman Schultz is the possibility of a Senate bid. If Florida's junior senator, Marco Rubio, runs for the presidency as expected, he has said he won't seek reelection to Congress - leaving the seat open for the taking. Politico first reported on the allegations, brought by Democratic donor and Orlando, Florida, trial lawyer John Morgan. The Florida congresswoman, who also heads the national Democratic Party, has since disputed the charges, calling them 'outrageous.' LIES: Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says is not true, and frankly 'outrageous' that she offered to support a ballot initiative in her state that would legalize medical marijuana if one of her critics piped down as she mulls a Senate campaign . The brouhaha goes back to last year, when Wasserman Schultz refused to support a ballot initiative that would have legalized medical marijuana in her state. It fell just short of the 60 percent approval rate it needed to become law in November's midterm election. Ahead of the election, Wasserman Schultz made it clear she did not support decriminalization and tried to rally other Democrats in her state to do the same. According to Politico, the fight was personal for Morgan, who devoted $4 million of his own money to initiative, and he's continued to hold the loss against fellow Democrat Wasserman Schultz. With rumors afoot that she planned to seek a promotion, Morgan and other medical marijuana supporters began badmouthing her again. That's when Wasserman Schultz's political adviser, Jason O’Malley, allegedly contacted the former campaign manager for Morgan's ballot initiative, Ben Pollara, and offered the activist a quid pro qou. If Morgan stopped beating up the congresswoman, she would back medical marijuana, O’Malley is said to have told Pollara. In an email provided to Politico by Morgan that had the subject line 'DWS,' Pollara told his former client that Wasserman Schultz is now 'saying she might be willing to support new amendment.' 'Any chance you’ll retract your statement' Pollara asked. 'No,' Morgan told him. 'She is a bully. I beat bullies up for a living.' He then told Politico: 'Actions have consequences...Her days of pushing people around are over.' On Friday she told the Florida-based Sun Sentinel that Morgan's assertions were false. 'I wouldn't change my position in exchange for support under any circumstances — ever,' she told her home state publication. 'I'm always very proud to stand in front of my constituents and explain when I have a difference of opinion with them.' President Barack Obama greets Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, also the chair of the Democratic National Committee before speaking at the DNC's winter meeting in Washington on Friday. The congresswoman appeared to be high spirits despite the public spat taking place between her office and the medical marijuana activists . What really happened, she said, is that her team approached Morgan and other medical marijuana backers after the suggested in an interview with Politico that they'd be open to discussing the issue with her. 'I've seen the language that they've proposed for the 2016 ballot,' Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel. 'I was more comfortable with the way the language was going…. I wanted to see if, before battle lines were drawn again, we could start a conversation.' That's not how Morgan sees it. 'What Debbie leaves out in her pushback was the crystal clear message that her potential support of the new amendment was predicated upon me withdrawing my comments to Politico,' he told the Sun Sentinel. 'I don't know how to view that as anything but an offer of a quid pro quo.' And he reportedly has the text messages to prove it, including one from Pollara to O'Malley in which the go-between said, 'Tried. Failed.' - to which O'Malley replied 'thanks.' A spokesman for Wasserman Schutlz told Politico that Pollara just had 'an unfortunate misunderstanding' of his conversation with the congresswoman's political adviser, an no deal was offered. Morgan says that's absurd. 'What on earth did he think ""Tried. Failed"" mean?” he told Politico as part of a follow up article that was published on Friday. Neither Wasserman Schultz's political adviser O'Malley or Pollara would offer direct comment on the incident to Politico, which unfolded as the DNC held its winter meeting in Washington, D.C., but Pollara didn't dispute the publication's reporting. And in a message to O'Malley after the original Politico article ran he allegedly said: 'Dude. I know it wasn’t your call but I told you no good come from me reaching out to morgan yesterday. I’m sorry man. You guys need to fire your press person though.'","A medical marijuana activist from Florida is accusing Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of attempted bribery .

"Tony Blair was able to parade a glittering line-up of star supporters from the worlds of film, music and television when he first won power – and even his successor, Gordon Brown, managed to gain the backing of Doctor Who and a supermodel. But with fewer than three months to go until polling day, Ed Miliband – who recently advertised for a new ‘celebrity endorsement’ adviser – appears to be struggling to win the backing of the celebrities his party could once count upon. The news comes after the previously ‘staunchly Labour’ TV presenters Ant and Dec said they could not picture him as Prime Minister. Scroll down for video . Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling (left) has stayed silent over whether she will back Ed Miliband at the next Election. Doctor Who star David Tennant (right) has not given a view . With fewer than three months to go until polling day, Ed Miliband (pictured) appears to be struggling to win the backing of the celebrities his party could once count upon . Lily Allen (left) had nothing to say when asked about her support of Ed Miliband. A spokesman for Fiona Phillips (right) said the ex-GMTV star 'doesn’t align herself to any particular political party' As the Labour leader prepares to woo the ‘creative industries’ by making a major speech on the arts tomorrow, The Mail on Sunday can reveal the results of its own investigation into Ed’s celebrity problem. We contacted ten public figures who enthused about Labour at the last Election. Of those, only one – the transvestite comedian and veteran Labour activist Eddie Izzard – said he would be backing Ed. Despite persistent approaches from this newspaper, previously pro-Labour stars were conspicuously silent. Among them was Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, who gave £1 million to Labour in 2008 when Mr Brown was leader. Supermodel Naomi Campbell (left) and business guru Duncan Bannatyne (right) failed to respond to requests for comment over whether they will be backing Ed Miliband . Actor Ross Kemp (left) did not offer a quote when asked for his endorsement of Mr Miliband. A spokesman for Mick Hucknall said they had ‘no idea’ whether the Simply Red singer would be voting for Mr Miliband . However, when asked about her current voting plans, her spokesman said: ‘J. K. Rowling is not planning to publicly announce who she will be supporting.’ It was a similar story with pop star Lily Allen, who said in 2010: ‘I can’t not vote Labour.’ However, when contacted last week, Ms Allen’s spokesman said: ‘No comment.’ In 2010, ex-GMTV star Fiona Phillips pledged: ‘I’m more Labour than Labour.’ This time, her spokesman said: ‘Fiona doesn’t align herself to any particular political party.’ At the last Election, Doctor Who star David Tennant said: ‘I would rather have Gordon Brown than David Cameron.’ But when asked if the same applied to Ed Miliband, Mr Tennant’s spokesman said: ‘We can’t reach David for a comment.’ Five years ago, ex-EastEnders actor Ross Kemp backed Labour. When Mr Kemp was asked last week for his endorsement of Mr Miliband, a spokesman said: ‘We may have a quote for you later.’ Ten minutes later, she said: ‘Sorry – no quote.’ Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson (left) failed to respond to requests for comment but transvestite comedian and veteran Labour activist Eddie Izzard (right) – said he would be backing Ed . At the last Election, Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall backed Mr Brown, but this time a spokesman said they had ‘no idea’ whether Mr Hucknall would be voting for Mr Miliband. A further three Labour backers in 2010 – former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, supermodel Naomi Campbell and business guru Duncan Bannatyne – failed to respond to requests for comment. Only Mr Izzard vowed to provide public support for Mr Miliband. Labour HQ appears to be concerned. The party has advertised for a £33,000-a-year endorsement officer ‘to forge new relationships with celebrities’. Yesterday, Labour said its well-known supporters included the artist Grayson Perry, the actor David Morrissey and the comic Ben Elton. A spokesman added: ‘We have a great spread of celebrity and high-profile figures supporting Labour.’ The Conservative Party has named footballers Sol Campbell and Frank Lampard, cricketer Darren Gough, artist Tracey Emin and Sir Michael Caine among its supporters. P.S. Even the man who's paid to impersonate the Labour leader says he has a 'fake image problem' If there’s one thing that everyone knows, it’s that Ed Miliband has an image problem, writes impressionist and comedian MATT FORDE. Even Labour supporters like me know it. It dogged him before his leadership and has only grown worse over the last five years. Lots of PR types bang on about how he needs to change his image to connect with the public, that his appearance and voice are a major barrier to people warming to him. He won’t change his image and neither should he, at least not in the way that some people think he should. I hope he doesn’t, because as an impressionist, he’s an absolute gift to me and if he becomes Prime Minister he’ll keep me in work for at least another five years. Poor political judgment is more damaging than a superficially bad image. Labour supporters who believe his problems are only skin deep need to ask themselves a simple question. If Ed radically overhauled his image, would it deliver a Labour majority? The answer is, of course, no. 'Absolute gift': Matt Forde as Ed Miliband . I’m not saying that Ed doesn’t have to change the way he handles himself, but there’s a difference between an image problem and not being yourself. Ed behaves in that way that so many modern politicians do. The faux-concern, shown by a slightly ruffled brow. The synthetic body language, complete with the thumb-point. It’s completely fake. A lot of it was borrowed from Bill Clinton and most of Ed Miliband’s physical routine is a poor imitation of Tony Blair. Ed should chill out a bit and be more of himself. Being nerdy in itself isn’t the problem that people think it is. There’s no merit in trying to label Ed Miliband as an underdog. This is politics, it’s not the 3rd round of the FA Cup. We want people who can lead and succeed. This is where Ed Miliband has a problem. He suffers from a lack of authority, caused by the lack of a coherent policy direction and bad judgment. Take his recent attacks on business. When Ed launched his attack on tax dodgers he should have had a host of business leaders sounded out beforehand and ready to do media rounds as part of a co-ordinated campaign to prove that Labour has successful friends who think he should be Prime Minister. This didn’t happen for one of two reasons. Either it wasn’t planned properly – which shows bad judgment – or it wasn’t possible because not enough successful business people were willing to support him. In terms of election manifesto, it doesn’t feel like Labour has anything really big to say. The cost of living crisis is genuine but it’s going to take more than freezing energy bills at an already high rate to reverse it. Ed Miliband should be talking about Britain beyond the deficit, about our hopes and dreams. Labour supporters like me want to hear about the jobs of the future and not just in an empty slogan. I want to know what they are and how Ed would get them here. The Coalition hasn’t made most people excited about the future, but Labour has completely failed to capitalise on this. I long to hear Ed Miliband talk the language of ambition – even if only in his nerdy voice – but he doesn’t. Like many other people, I long to feel inspired about the future of Britain and want to feel like the governance of the country is in safe hands. David Cameron or Nick Clegg don’t fit the bill. But the brutal truth is, I doubt Ed Miliband does either.

"Hapless Islamic State militants have vowed online to take over Rome - and 'throw homosexuals off the leaning tower of pizza'. In the message, posted by a Twitter account linked to the terror group, the ISIS supporter also threatens to bring sharia law to the Italian capital. It comes just days after masked jihadists warned of their intention to conquer the city in a video that showed the mass beheading of 21 Christians in Libya. But rather than spark widespread panic, the threats have triggered a flood of mocking responses - with dozens taking to social media to make fun of the jihadists and their takeover plans. Hapless: Above, the tweets posted today by an account linked to the Islamic State. In them, the user threatens to bring shariah law to Rome and 'use your leaning tower of pizza to throw off homosexual' In the threat posted today, Twitter user Abu Abdullah Britani, who openly publicises ISIS activity, wrote: '#We_Are_Coming_O_Rome with slaughter'. The message was soon followed by one that read:  '#We_Are_Coming_O_Rome, we will conquer & establish the justice of #shariah. We will use your leaning tower of pizza to throw off homosexual'. The terrorists have previously thrown men off of buildings for 'being gay'. Earlier this year, images emerged that appeared to show militants hurling one man off a  building in the town of Tal Abyad in Raqqa as supposed punishment for having a ‘homosexual affair’. This most recent threat appears to indicate the terrorists intend to bring their barbaric practices to Europe - and plan to repeat the horrific scenes off the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It appears the tweeter is unaware the tower is in Pisa, not Rome. The hashtag #We_Are_Coming_O_Rome has been used by Islamic State supporters to discuss plans to reach Rome after the city was mentioned in a sickening video released earlier this week.

The footage, which lasts five minutes, shows the Egyptian Christians dressed in jumpsuits being marched one by one along a lonely beach, each held by a fighter clad in black. The captives, their faces uncovered, are made to kneel before being forced to lie down. The masked jihadists then behead them simultaneously. In the video, one of the militants warned: 'Today we are south of Rome. We will conquer Rome with Allah’s permission.' They claimed their prisoners had been beheaded in Libya - just 220 miles south of Italy. In the wake of the threat, Italian security chiefs have approved plans to put 4,800 soldiers on the country's streets and post them to 'sensitive sites' to help prevent terrorist attacks. Response: Rather than spark widespread panic, the threats have triggered a flood of mocking responses - with dozens taking to social media to make fun of the jihadists and their takeover plans . Reports claim 500 will be deployed in Rome - where soldiers are already guarding diplomatic residences, synagogues and Jewish schools. The troops are also expected to be deployed at tourist venues such as archaeological sites and monuments. Meanwhile, the commander of Vatican City's 110-man Swiss Guard said his forces are ready to defend Pope Francis if ISIS attempt a strike . But some experts have claimed that 'Rome' could be being used as a symbolic term by the terrorists, and might refer to the United States, Turkey, or the West as a whole. Mocking: Some Romans offered advice to ISIS - with some warning them against travelling in rush-hour traffic (top) and another pointing out that the city already has a list of problems to address (above) Unconvinced Twitter users have taken to the social networking site to undermine ISIS threats with a number of tweets and mocking memes. Some played on the city's history as the home of fearsome warriors, with one user posting an image of Russell Crowe in Gladiator with the message 'So you are coming to Rome, let me entertain you'. Another posted a cartoon of men dressed in armour and shields with the caption 'Italian special units alerted to the threat of ISIS...' A number of Romans took the opportunity to offer advice to ISIS - with some warning them against travelling in rush-hour traffic and others pointing out there may be glass on the street. And one young woman politely asked the terrorists to stay at home, saying that the city already had a 'long list' of problems that needed to be fixed.","Message was posted by Twitter account used to publicise ISIS activity .

"Nasa has revealed that astronauts aboard the International Space Station use virtual reality to train for spacewalks. However, while Facebook's Oculus and Samsung are developing small, hi-tech solutions, Nasa has used the advantage of zero gravity to fashion a more low tech solution. Instead of a dedicated headset, astronaut Terry Virts posted a picture of the solution - a laptop strapped to his face. Nasa's system uses a standard laptop strapped to an astronaut's face. A prototype of Facebook's Oculus VR headset . His tweet revealed the system is being used to train astronauts in using a jet pack they use to get back to the station in the event of an incident that left them stranded. Essentially a 'life jacket' for spacewalks, SAFER is a self-contained maneuvering unit that is worn like a backpack. The system relies on small nitrogen-jet thrusters to let an astronaut move around in space. Its relatively small size and weight allow for convenient storage. However, its size was achieved by limiting the amount of propellant SAFER carries, so it can only be used for a limited time. That is why SAFER is intended primarily for emergency rescue, and not as an alternative to tools such as tethers and safety grips as a means of getting around the station. EVA crewmembers are required to use SAFER whenever the shuttle is docked to station and unable to fly over to recover a spacewalker who has become un-tethered and can't get back to the airlock. Astronauts control the SAFER device by using a hand controller attached to the front of their space suits. SAFER's propulsion, which is provided by 24 fixed-position thrusters that expel nitrogen gas, was first tested in 1994 by astronaut Mark Lee outside the Space Shuttle Discovery. According to David Homan of Nasa's virtual reality lab, the system is also used to train for spacewalks. EVA crewmembers are required to use SAFER whenever the shuttle is docked to station and unable to fly over to recover a spacewalker who has become un-tethered and can't get back to the airlock. If an astronaut would drift off, it provides free-flying mobility to return to the spaceship. It is worn on spacewalks outside the International Space Station (ISS), and was worn on spacewalks outside the Space Shuttle. So far, there has not been an emergency in which it was needed. Astronauts control the SAFER device by using a hand controller attached to the front of their space suits. SAFER's propulsion, which is provided by 24 fixed-position thrusters that expel nitrogen gas, was first tested in 1994 by astronaut Mark Lee outside the Space Shuttle Discovery. All of the space station and orbiter structures are graphically presented in the virtual reality helmets worn by the spacewalking astronauts. The structures are also displayed on video screens that simulate the actual camera views that crew members inside the space station or space shuttle would have. These views allow crew members to monitor the spacewalk activities as they would in orbit. 'The same software used in the training facilities on the ground is also used on the laptop computers on the station,' he said. 'The crews in space use the software to review upcoming spacewalks and robotic arm operations before actually performing the tasks. 'The program is also used on board during robotic operations to provide the arm operator a situational awareness view of the arm while it is in motion. 'The graphic arms in the program are driven by ""real"" data from the ""real"" arms during actual operations to provide the operator with a synthetic bird's-eye view of what's happening outside the station. Essentially a 'life jacket' for spacewalks, SAFER is a self-contained maneuvering unit that is worn like a backpack. 'New configuration data can be developed on the ground and uplinked to the computers on board the station at anytime to make sure the crews have the latest station configuration at all times.' A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits. Nasa is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear. The fault is linked to a 2013 emergency when water dangerously flooded a European astronaut's helmet causing a near-drowning. A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits. Nasa is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear . The first spacewalk by a pair of U.S. astronauts was supposed to occur tomorrow, but Nasa today bumped it to Saturday to complete a spacesuit investigation. The second spacewalk is now Wednesday; the third is March 1. The extensive, outdoor cable-routing work will prepare for the arrival of new commercial crew capsules in 2017. Two critical fan and pump units for the astronauts' spacesuits failed recently during routine maintenance in orbit. The spacewalks will be performed by Nasa astronauts Barry Wilmore (left) and Terry Virts (right) Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. Engineers suspect water seeped into the bearings, causing them to corrode and seize up. Both units were returned to Earth on the Dragon capsule last week. Spare units were put in the spacesuits, and those have checked out. Nasa says a pump failure would cut short a spacewalk, but not endanger anyone. An unrelated problem with the same component led to an astronaut's near-drowning in 2013. Kenny Todd, a space station manager, said earlier this week that the corrosion is likely the result of frequent water sampling put in place after the 2013 episode. Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts are the designated spacewalkers. The astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station. The ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017. The space agency would like to pull off all three spacewalks before Wilmore leaves the orbiting lab in mid-March. Private companies SpaceX and Boeing are working on crew capsules — under Nasa contract — to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. Nasa lost the ability to launch its own crews when the space shuttles retired in 2011, and is paying Russia for crew transportation. The issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano during a spacewalk in July 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered (shown here in this image from the ISS) - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water .","Astronaut Terry Virts posted a picture of the solution to Twitter .

"Two men and a woman have been arrested and charged over the alleged rape, murder and mutilation of a Washington state teenager, who had been missing for four months before his remains were found last week. The body of Jesus Isidor-Mendoza, 18, had been cut in half and put inside a duffel bag, which was found at the bottom of a ravine behind a dilapidated house in Tacoma on February 8. He was last seen leaving his mother's house in Lakewood to go to college on October 22. Wallace Jackson, 48, Darrel Arthur Daves, 49, and Crystal Share Jackson, 30, have now been charged in connection with the homicide,KVAL-TV reported. Brutally murdered: Police say Jesus Isidor-Mendoza, 18, was raped and drowned before his body was cut in half, wrapped in plastic, placed inside a duffel bag and thrown into a ravine in Tacoma, Washington . Detectives suspect the death was meth-related. 'This gruesome murder is a reminder of how violence the methamphetamine business can be,' Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said in a statement, according to The New York Daily News. Investigators believe that Isidor-Mendoza met the trio in the garage of Crystal Jackson's house on the night of October 22. Darrel Arthur Daves lived at the garage, and Wallace Jackson was also there. The two men are accused of raping Isidor-Mendoza, before drowning his head in a laundry bucket. Once he was dead, the two allegedly chopped the body in half, wrapped it in plastic and stored it in the garage. However after two days the cadaver began to smell. Wallace and Crystal Jackson - who are not related - are accused of putting the body inside a red duffel bag and throwing it down the ravine. A local then found the remains  after allegedly overhearing Wallace Jackson tell someone about how there was a dead body in the ravine, according to The Tacoma News Tribune. Scene: The 18-year-old's body was found in a ravine off the 3000 block of Delin Street, Tacoma . All three are now being held in Pierce County Jail. They were initially placed on a 72-hour hold as detectives continue to investigate the murder. Crystal Jackson allegedly confessed to police during questioning, having witnessed the rape and murder. All three have since been charged with first-degree murder. The defendants pleaded not guilty  in court on Friday afternoon, according to . Wallace Jackson and Crystal Jackson are being held on $2 million bail. Darrel Daves is being held in lieu of $5 million bail, according to The Bonney Lake Courier-Herald. Wallace Jackson and Daves are reportedly known drug users in the area.","Jesus Isidor-Mendoza, 18, went missing October 22 in Tacoma .

"Ed Miliband was warned by Lord Mandelson (pictured) that he risks opening a ‘credibility gap’ over his spending plans . Ed Miliband was warned he risks opening a ‘credibility gap’ over his spending plans as it emerged Labour has not agreed how it would pay for a cut to university fees. The Labour leader is expected to announce details of the party’s key policy to lower tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 within days, but has yet to reach agreement with shadow chancellor Ed Balls on how this will be funded. Lord Mandelson weighed into the row yesterday, admitting the policy was not yet finished and insisting Labour must say where it will find the money. Otherwise, he said, it would face a ‘credibility gap’ over its plans to cut the deficit. Lord Mandelson, who was Business Secretary under Gordon Brown and was in charge of universities, said it was ‘inconceivable’ that Labour could cut funding to the sector. He told an audience of academics and university administrators in London: ‘If any reduction in fees is announced, and I’m not assuming that it will be, it’s absolutely vital that replacement funding from taxation is identified and announced at the same time. ‘Not in a generalised way, but in a specific way. Because that will ensure that no credibility gap is opened up either around university funding or the Labour Party’s commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit.’ He supported Government claims that the rise in fees to £9,000 had not led to a fall in university applications, pointing out that even the poorest students were now more likely to apply. Lord Mandelson also said cutting fees for UK students could increase the rate at which universities recruit from abroad to plug the funding gap – potentially ‘at the expense’ of home applicants. When he campaigned for the leadership of the Labour Party, Mr Miliband proposed a graduate tax as an alternative to tuition fees. Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to announce details of the party’s key policy to lower tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 within days, but has yet to reach agreement on how this will be funded . But Labour is yet to agree on its stance ahead of May’s election. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said cutting fees to £6,000 would be ‘foolish’, costing the exchequer £10billion over five years. '[It] would be a populist gesture which would achieve nothing and do a lot of damage,’ he wrote in a letter to Mr Miliband. Critics of cutting fees point out that the benefits would mainly go to the highest-earning graduates because they would end up paying less. A Labour Party spokesman said its policy on university fees would be ‘set out shortly’. Lord Mandelson, who was Business Secretary under Gordon Brown (both pictured) and was in charge of universities, said it was ‘inconceivable’ that Labour could cut funding to the sector . ■A Pact between Labour and the SNP would be ‘the ultimate nightmare’ that could break up and bankrupt Britain, David Cameron warned yesterday. He accused Ed Miliband of betraying the Union for refusing to rule out an election deal with the SNP, who are on course for a landslide in Scotland. Speaking at the Tory conference in Edinburgh, he said it was ‘appalling’ that Labour wrapped itself in the Union flag last year and is now willing to ‘work with a bunch of people who would rip up that flag’.","Miliband has been warned he risks opening 'credibility gap' on spending .

"You might think twice before allowing a mobile app to have access to your location data. But it’s not just apps you need to worry about – hackers can now track your every move through your phone’s power consumption. Unlike GPS or Wi-Fi location tracking, power data is freely available to any installed app allowing anyone with the know-how ti track a phone location to 90 per cent accuracy. Many of us think twice before allowing a mobile app to have access to our location data.But it’s not just apps we need to worry about – hackers can now track our every move through our phone’s power consumption . Researchers at Stanford University and Israel's defence research group, Rafael, have named their technique 'PowerSpy', according to a report by Wired. The technique works because a phone's transmission requires more power to connect with a cell tower that is farther away. It also requires more power when obstacles such as block its signal. This means that temporary power drains, such as a phone call, will help highlight the type of environment the mobile phone user is in. It works because a phone's transmission requires more power to connect with a cell tower that is farther away. It also requires more power when obstacles such as block its signal. This means that temporary power drains, such as a phone call, will help highlight the type of environment the mobile phone user is in. 'A sufficiently long power measurement (several minutes) enables the learning algorithm to 'see' through the noise,' the researchers write. 'We show that measuring the phone's aggregate power consumption over time completely reveals the phone's location and movement.' The researchers collected power data from Android phones as they drove around California's Bay Area and the Israeli city of Haifa. Then they compared their data with the power consumption of an LG Nexus 4 handset as it repeatedly travelled through one of those routes. They were able to guess which route it was nine out of ten times. Someday, scientists claim spies could use PowerSpy to track targets, or apps could use its location tracking for advertising purposes . The technique only works if the person being spied on has travelled that route before, and hackers have measured how power consumption changes along that route. If they don't know your routine, that accuracy of location drop from 90 per cent to about 60 per cent. Someday, the scientists claim spies could use PowerSpy to track targets, or apps could use its location tracking for advertising purposes. 'You could install an application like Angry Birds that communicates over the network but doesn't ask for any location permissions,' Yan Michalevski, one of the Stanford researchers told Wired. 'It gathers information and sends it back to me to track you in real time, to understand what routes you've taken when you drove your car or to know exactly where you are on the route.' Last year the same group found that they could use the gyroscope in a phone as a basic microphone. The 'gyrophone' could recognise spoken digits and distinguish between male and female voices. Millions of people are being spied on by free apps they have installed on their mobile phones, security experts have warned. Many 'flashlight apps' which allow a device to be used as a torch also secretly record the most sensitive personal information. This may include the location of the phone, details of its owner and their contacts, and even the content of text messages. The data is then transmitted to market research companies and advertising agencies to track user's shopping habits, experts claim. But it is also suspected that criminal gangs, hackers and identity thieves have developed torch apps of their own to obtain personal data about consumers which could give them access to their bank accounts. The most popular flashlight apps for Android smartphones have been downloaded tens of millions of times. They include the Super-Bright LED Flashlight, the Brightest Flashlight Free and the Tiny Flashlight+LED.","Technique, dubbed PowerSpy, was created by US and Israeli scientists .

"George Osborne promised to prioritise tax cuts for middle earners yesterday as the economic recovery delivered the biggest boost to the public coffers since before the financial crisis. The Government recorded a surplus of £8.8billion in January – the largest for seven years – after a flood of tax payments. The boost rounded off a week of economic good news for the UK, in which inflation fell to its lowest level for 55 years, while the number of people in work reached a record high. George Osborne, pictured centre visiting London Underground workers upgrading the Tube network, promised to prioritise tax cuts for middle earners yesterday . Pay growth easily outstripped inflation for the fourth consecutive month in December, ending the squeeze on household incomes. Total average weekly earnings were 2.1 per cent higher than a year earlier, up from 1.7 per cent last month. The stock market has risen to a 16-year high and is on the verge of overhauling its previous peak, reached in 1999. Speaking yesterday as he visited London Underground workers upgrading the Tube network, the Chancellor said the figures vindicated the Coalition’s decisions on tax and spending, including the cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, which ‘sent a signal’ that Britain backed enterprise. And he vowed that further tax cuts, offering relief for those paying the 40p higher rate, and a new income tax threshold of £12,500 would be his ‘priority’ if the Conservatives remain in power. ‘I took a difficult decision to cut the 50p rate,’ he said. ‘That rate sent a message that Britain was an uncompetitive place to do business. The Chancellor watched overnight engineering works at Victoria station with Mayor of London Boris Johnson . ‘Today… the tax receipts show that actually, by reducing it to 45p we have not lost revenue.’ Britain’s highest earners now pay more than a quarter of the entire income tax bill, more than when the Coalition came to power. Nearly 300,000 taxpayers are forecast to contribute the equivalent of £45.9billion by the end of this year. The windfall puts the Chancellor on course to hit his borrowing targets for the year, and could even give him some room for pre-election giveaways in next month’s Budget. The Office for National Statistics figures showed Mr Osborne looks set to hit his target of reducing the annual deficit – which hit a record £153billion or around ten per cent of national income under Labour – from £97.3billion last year to £91.3billion this year or 5 per cent. Last month’s tax surplus was the biggest since 2008 and £2.3billion larger than in 2014. Self-assessment payments were strong because many high earners deferred bonuses from 2012-13 to take advantage of the cut in the 50p rate. Self-assessment receipts were £1.7billion higher at a record £12.3billion, corporation tax receipts were up £900million to £8.3billion and VAT rose by £200million to £10.6billion. Samuel Tombs, analyst at Capital Economics, said: ‘The recovery is finally having a positive impact on the public purse.’ Labour’s treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said the figures were ‘distorted’ by delayed bonuses and vowed to put the top rate back up to 50p. He added: ‘Our plan will make sensible spending cuts.’ Council house tenants will be given taxpayer-funded grants of £30,000 help them buy a home. The Right to Buy Social Mobility Fund is aimed at freeing people ‘trapped in social housing’, the Government said, such as those who want to downsize. Some £84million will be made available over two years.","Chancellor promised to prioritise tax cuts for middle earners yesterday .

"As any child of the eighties  will tell you, neon is a staple of any after-dark celebration- but two foodies from Melbourne have taken their love of it one step further to create a sweet treat that lights up the night. Steve Felice and Glenn Storey, the pair behind nitrogen ice-cream pop-up 196 Below, have designed glow-in-the-dark neon ice cream in a first for colour-lovers around the nation. The fancy fluoro treat is the brain child of Steve, a Melbourne-based patissier, who told Daily Mail Australia that his life has always 'revolved around neon'. 196 Below, a nitrogen ice-cream pop-up 196 Below, is launching a glow-in-the-dark neon ice cream range . 'I used to be a dance party child in the 1990's and early 2000's and I used to make party clothes out of neon material,' Steve said. 'I was in a cake decorating shop and saw UV-reactive food colouring, and thought ""wow, that would be really cool. I wonder if I can actually pull this off"",' he said. Steve, who started 196 Below 18 months ago with his business partner Glenn, said that he had been looking to do something really different and jumped at the chance. 196 Below specialises in nitrogen ice cream, a method which cools the dairy delicacy down quickly for a creamier texture and fresher flavour, Steve said this was a way to have a bit of fun. 'We do a lot of different events and festivals, and love playing around with the theme of wherever we are serving, so I thought I would experiment and see if it could be done,' Steve said. The gourmet ice-cream business is participating in White Night on Saturday evening in Melbourne, a festival that runs for one night each year from sun set to sun rise. Steve and Glenn started the nitrogen ice-cream business 18 months ago . The three brand new fluoro flavours are Redskin, pine-lime, and mango passionfruit . The pop-up ice-creamery will boast six UV floodlights at it's stall so that customers can see their sweet treat glow in the dark as it is being made . In keeping with the theme, the pair decided to launch three fluoro flavours- Redskin, pine-lime, and mango passionfruit. The UV-reactive liquid colouring is completely safe to consume, and have been certified by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia. 'Last Monday I bought some and tried few drops and it worked. I did a jig around the kitchen and wanted to unveil it immediately but I had to wait,' Steve said. When 196 Below announced the neon ice cream on their Facebook page, the reaction was overwhelming. 'We did a big unveiling, and it's been crazy. A lot of people have been commenting how cool and different it is,' Steve said. The pop-up ice-creamery will boast six UV floodlights at it's stall so that customers can see their sweet treat glow in the dark as it is being made. The range is being launched at White Night in Melbourne on Saturday evening . Steve Felice and Glenn Storey are the brains behind 196 Below and the new range of neon ice-cream . Nitrogen ice-cream is a method which cools the ice-cream quickly to create a creamy flavour . 'As we're churning it out people will be able to see it glowing. We also want people to have fun outside of the store and take pictures with their ice cream,' Steve said. 'We're more about taste than anything, but tonight it's about having fun and enjoying the night.' 196 Below will use over 500 litres of liquid nitrogen to make their ice-cream on Saturday night, and is hoping to make a lot of colour-loving customers happy. The organisers of White Night are expecting up to 800,000 people to attend, as the Melbourne CBD is overrun with revellers. Along with White Night, music festival Soundwave is also running, as well as celebrations for Chinese New Year and sport-loving cricket fans in town for the International Cricket Cup. 196 Below ice-cream costs $8.50 for a cone or cup, and popular flavours include salted caramel (created with hand-made caramel) and chocolate brownie. The ice-cream is made with only five ingredients, is vegan friendly and dairy free, and is made without preservatives. 'This is something completely new, so it's going to be an interesting 12 hours,' said Steve. 'On a good night we serve between 700 and 800 people, but considering the feedback we've been getting it could be even more.' 196 Below ice-cream costs $8.50 for a cone or cup, and  flavours include salted caramel and chocolate brownie .","Australia's first neon ice cream has been launched by 196 Below .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has inspected a live-fire artillery drill  near the sea border with the rival South in a show of defiance believed to be timed ahead of annual U.S.-South Korean exercises. The drill, which was reported by state media today, involved artillery and anti-ship rockets and was focused on striking and capturing an enemy island, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Analysts in Seoul said North Korea was attempting to demonstrate its military capabilities ahead of next month's U.S.-South Korean drills, which Pyongyang has condemned as a rehearsal for an invasion.

The military drills conducted near the border with the South involved artillery (pictured) and anti-ship rockets . Land to air missiles are launched into the air, in pictures broadcast by official state media . Analysts say North Korea's military drills are usually conducted to reassure citizens they are protected . The military exercise (pictured) was reported to have been a mock attack and invasion of an enemy island . The exercise involved the Korean People's Army's 4th Corps, which led the 2010 shelling of the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong that left four South Korean soldiers and civilians dead. Kim expressed 'great satisfaction' during the exercise and urged his army to be prepared for battle against the U.S., KCNA reported. The official Rodong Sinmun published photos of the tyrant watching the exercise with binoculars and projectiles being fired from what appeared to be multiple rocket launchers and other weapons. State media outlets did not disclose the exact time and location of the drill. The U.S. and South Korea have repeatedly said that their war games are defensive in nature, and they have no intentions of attacking the North. North Korea told the United States last month that it was willing to impose a temporary moratorium on its nuclear tests if Washington scraps the military drills with South Korea this year, but the allies have refused to cancel the exercises. North Korea routinely conducts drills in weeks prior to the U.S.-South Korea exercises and they are believed to be a significant burden for a country in desperate need of cash.

Rockets were fired as analysts said the drill was carried out to showcase the country's military technology . South Korean professor Koh Yu-hwan said the North's military drills were using fewer and fewer troops in recent years due to the excessive costs involved . Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said that the North had been reducing the number of soldiers in the drills in recent years and is instead increasingly focusing on showcasing its newer weapons in an apparent attempt at controlling costs. He said: 'North Korea considers it important to display its military capabilities ahead of the U.S.-South Korea drills to give its people the impression that it is well-prepared for an invasion attempt.' South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told reporters early this week that the U.S. was planning to send a larger number of soldiers than it did last year to the 'Key Resolve and Foal Eagle' exercises beginning in early March, but did not provide a specific number. About 12,700 American troops participated last year.","The North Korean tyrant watched a military drill near border with the South .
