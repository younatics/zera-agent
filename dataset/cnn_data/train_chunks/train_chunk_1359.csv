"The blasted-out building where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen died after an eight-hour siege by police has already become a macabre tourist attraction. These dramatic pictures show the print works on an industrial estate 19 miles north east of Paris where Cherif and Said Kouachi  made their last stand. The two-storey building, with every window shot out, was today the scene of ghoulish fascination as visitors posed for ‘selfies’ and families brought their children to gawp at the damage. Scroll down for video . Grim lure: People gathered today at the print works where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen made their last stand . History: From behind a police cordon, ordinary passers-by recorded the scene on their camera phones . One local said: 'We came here to think about everything that happened here. The atmosphere is heavy' Police had stormed the premises on Friday following an eight hour standoff after the gunmen took control of the small business taking owner Michele Catalano hostage. In front of the heavily guarded building was the grey Peugeot 206 that the extremist Islamist brothers hijacked in the forest on Friday morning before setting off on a frantic car chase along the Rue National 2. The front windscreen of the car was pierced by a single bullet hole while the back windscreen was completely shot out. Families took their children on a bike ride past the scene as dozens of tourists snapped pictures on their camera phones. One Italian tourist, Pio Pirolo, asked a bystander to take a selfie of him, saying: ‘I want to show everyone that I was here. Some day this will be history.’ Blown out: The windows of the print works were destroyed during the eight-hour standoff with police . The industrial estate is around 19 miles from the centre of Paris near the city's Charles de Gaulle airport . Damage: The religious fanatics had said they would only emerge from their hideout as martyrs . An elderly man taking pictures of his wife on his camera phone said: ‘We just wanted to see it in person, not just on the news.’ One local resident, who lives opposite the factory, brought his two sons to see the site after attending a march in the morning. Fabrice Bruneau, a recruitment consultant, said: ‘We came here to think about everything that happened here, to remember it. The atmosphere is heavy here.' The father-of-two said he spent the siege crouched in his shower room: ‘We hid in our bathroom the whole day watching the scene on smartphone TV. ‘At 6pm we heard explosions and the windows all vibrated. I was so scared because of our children. ‘There is no more liberty in France. People are too scared. ‘ . One resident who lives opposite the factory said: 'I was so scared because of our children' No change: The Peugeot 206 which the brothers hijacked on the morning of the siege remained outside . ‘We are living in a terrible age. We have a problem with integration. We need to do something. These people are a risk.’ Cherif Kouachi and his brother Said sparked global horror when they burst into the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and slaughtered 12 people last Wednesday, including a police officer outside the building. The extremists spent two days on the run until they were gunned down at the industrial estate in Dammartin, which is near Charles de Gaulle Airport. The end to the pursuit played out on live TV and social media as one hostage was eventually freed from the printing plant. Graphic designer Lilian Lepere, 27, who was inside the building, hid in a cardboard box and sent text messages to police after realising the Charlie Hebdo killers were holed up in his office. He told friends: 'I'm not a hero. I just did what anyone would do to save their own life. 'I just did what any normal person would do if they were in the same situation.'

"Indonesian divers on Sunday found the black box of the AirAsia plane which crashed in the Java Sea a fortnight ago with 162 people aboard, the transport ministry said. But they failed to retrieve it because it was stuck under debris from the main body of the plane, it added. 'The navy divers in Jadayat state boat have succeeded in finding a very important instrument, the black box of AirAsia QZ8501,' said Tonny Budiono, a senior ministry official. Scroll down for video .

The tail section of the the AirAsia plane is is taken away on Sunday aboard the Crest Onyx ship . The news comes a day after the tail section of the AirAsia aircraft was pulled from the sea off the coast of central Borneo on Saturday. Indonesian search teams now believe they have found the fuselage of the AirAsia airliner, and divers hope calmer waters on Monday will allow them to retrieve the black box flight recorders. Also on Sunday a photograph emerged of an AirAsia search team member who appears to be posing in front of the downed jet's tail, which was recovered from the bottom of the Java Sea on Saturday. In the picture taken on board a ship, the searcher looks to be smiling while a colleague holds up a smart phone to snap the moment.

The man standing in front of the tail, which was pulled from the sea off the coast of Indonesian island Borneo two weeks after flight QZ8501 crashed, is wearing a uniform. Indonesia AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lost contact with air traffic control in bad weather on December 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. None of the 162 people on the aircraft survived. So far 48 bodies have been recovered from the site, including at least two still strapped into their seats. Searchers have been hearing pings, believed to be from the aircraft's two black boxes near where the tail of the Airbus A320-200 aircraft was raised. Marsma Supriyadi, operations coordinator for the National Search and Rescue Agency, said earlier on Sunday a sonar scan had revealed an object measuring 10 metres by four metres by 2.5 metres on the sea floor. 'They suspect it is the body of the plane. There is a big possibility that the black box is near the body of the plane,' Supriyadi said in the town of Pangkalan Bun, the base for the search effort on Borneo. 'If it is the body of the plane then we will first evacuate the victims. Secondly we will search for the black box.' The tail was hoisted from the Java Sea on Saturday with inflatable bags from a depth of 30 metres . The find comes two weeks after the AirAsia flight crashed into the sea, with 162 people on board . 'Three ships have (recorded) the pings so we can confirm the coordinates of the location of the black box,' Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee investigator Santoso Sayogo confirmed. If weather conditions are conducive, 'hopefully they will recover the black box tomorrow (Monday) morning,' Santoso said. 'The coordinates show the bottom of the sea (in that location) is sand so the divers should easily be able to see it.' If and when the recorders are found and taken to the capital, Jakarta, for analysis, it could take up to two weeks to download data, investigators said, although the information could be accessed in as little as two days if the devices are not badly damaged. Bad weather has hampered the search efforts, making it difficult for divers to inspect the site . So far 48 bodies have been recovered from the site, including two that were still strapped into their seats . Separately on Sunday, a DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Indonesia's Trigana Air crashed on landing at Enarotali Airport in Paniai, Papua.

"He has long been accused of chillaxing on the job. Now it seems Larry the Downing Street moggy has had one cat nap too many for his owner's liking. In his second major reshuffle in two weeks, David Cameron has reportedly sacked his pet as Chief Mouser to the Cabinet after finally growing tired of Larry's lethargy. One chillax too many: Larry the Downing Street cat has been sacked as chief mouse catcher by David Cameron after a dismal performance this year . New predator: Mr Cameron has brought in Chancellor George Osborne's tabby Freya (above) as the chief mouser in place of Larry . It took Larry six months in the post before he made his first 'confirmed kill' last month and he doesn't appear to have made any since. The breaking point came on Thursday when the Prime Minister found Larry asleep on his chair in his Number 10 study as a mouse ran across the room, according to The People. He attempted to wake Larry to spur him into action, but all the feline could manage was to open one eye and duly didn't budge an inch. Mr Cameron has now drafted in Chancellor George Osborne's tabby Freya as the new Mouser of State to patrol Numbers 10, 11 and 12. Sources claim Larry will be completely sidelined and have described the new arrangement as a 'job share' to avoid any hurt feelings. Freya, who returned to Downing Street after going missing for three years, is thought to an altogether tougher and more street-wise predator. Lethargic: Larry prepares to ambush a mouse, but misses. He finally made his first 'confirmed kill' after six months in the job . Paw prowler: Larry was recruited last February to rid No 10 of its rodent problem, but swiftly earned a reputation for napping rather than ratting . Larry finally made his first kill last month in what has been a barren year for the five-year-old. Larry was recruited last February to rid No 10 of its rodent problem, but swiftly earned a  reputation for napping rather than ratting. Olly Grender, deputy director of communications at No 10, tweeted: ‘Just arrived at work. Larry the cat sitting proudly outside No 10 front door with a dead mouse next to him.’ She added: ‘Contrary to popular belief Larry is not a tart for the cameras and moved.’ In June, he was photographed soaking up the sunshine in the middle of Downing Street. But he soon found himself hoisted up by a police protection officer and dumped unceremoniously by No 11, where David and Samantha Cameron live. On the hunt: Freya was just a few months old when she went missing from the Osbornes’ home three years ago, but was returned to them earlier this year . Trading places: Freya lives with the Osbornes in . the flat above No 10 (right), while the Camerons and their cat Larry . live above No 11 (left) Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, was hailed as a ‘good ratter’ and having ‘a high chase-drive and hunting instinct’ when he first arrived in Downing Street. But his career has, until now, been less than successful. Indeed, last year a photographer caught him as he pounced for a mouse – and missed. Larry's life was turned upside down in June when Mr Osborne's long-lost cat Freya was found safe and well, raising concerns that a turf war may break out. Freya was just a few months old when she went missing from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill home three years ago. Mr Osborne, wife Frances and their two young children Luke and Liberty searched the streets of West London and put up ‘lost’ posters, but to no avail. They gave up hope long before moving into Downing Street last year, assuming the cat had got lost – or worse, been run over. So they transferred their affections to the family budgie, Gibson, named after RAF Dambusters hero Guy Gibson, and two goldfish. But earlier this year, Frances, an author, received a phone call telling her Freya was alive and well. She had been living as a stray in a garden a few streets away from the Osbornes’ Notting Hill house, lovingly fed and looked after by a neighbour who had not seen the posters.",PM drafts in Chancellor's tabby Freya instead .
"Prince Andrew's bodyguards were accused yesterday of turning a blind eye during his visits to a paedophile friend's 'house of sin'. Protection officers accompanied the royal to Jeffrey Epstein's Florida mansion where he allegedly partied with naked young women. Juan Alessi, who was Epstein's butler for 11 years, said: 'Andrew was with security. He had his two bodyguards from Scotland Yard. I can remember their names. 'The bodyguards were off duty and they slept in one of the guest bedrooms.' Hundreds of under-age girls are said to have been abused at Epstein's mansion and one woman says she was forced by the shamed financier to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, which is below the age of consent in Florida. Scroll down for video . Prince Andrew's (left) bodyguards were accused yesterday of turning a blind eye during his visits to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein's Florida mansion, pictured together in 2011 . The prince fiercely denies having any sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts, now 30. But there were calls yesterday for Scotland Yard to investigate whether Andrew's protection officers suspected or witnessed any criminal activity at Epstein's homes. A royalty protection source said: 'Epstein's Florida mansion appears to have resembled a five-star brothel. And Epstein behaved like a pimp. 'I would have expected protection officers to have advised the duke to leave immediately. 'If they did not, the big question is why? The problem is that protection officers are very well paid – some get up to £80,000 a year which is double their basic pay – because of overtime and special allowances. 'They can sometimes forget they are working for the police, not the royal household. Challenging a royal about their conduct, or the people they are mixing with, can result in a loss of trust and their removal from a very lucrative job.' Dai Davies, a former head of the protection unit, said the prince's bodyguards might be able to corroborate his account that he never had sexual relations with his accuser in 2001. But he added: 'I would have expected Prince Andrew to have been severely warned on the dangers of liaising with Epstein. This is an extraordinary case. I would have expected officers in royalty protection to bring matters to senior officers' attention far earlier.' Caroline Pidgeon, Lib Dem deputy chairman of the London Assembly police and crime committee, said: 'If royal protection security staff ever suspect that criminal activity is taking place at a venue they are present at, they have an obligation to take action. Turning a blind eye should never be an option.' Virginia Roberts, now 30, claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, which is below the age of consent in Florida . Jenny Jones, the Green deputy chairman of the same committee, said: 'The Met Commissioner should look into this as a matter of urgency. 'These are under-age sex allegations and I do have a problem with officers – that we, as taxpayers, fund – going to events like these alleged parties. 'The Commissioner needs to start asking questions about what these officers saw and what Prince Andrew did or didn't get up to.' A spokesman for the Labour group on the London Assembly said Scotland Yard had 'serious questions to answer'. He added: 'Those being protected at public expense have a responsibility to consider the situations they are placing those public servants in and a duty to ensure their actions do not bring their protection officers into disrepute. If what you've been told is true there are serious questions to be asked as it would appear to be an inappropriate position to put these protection officers in.' But Peter Prentice, who headed the royalty protection squad at the time of the Epstein parties, has defended the 'laissez faire' approach, saying it was 'not an offence for a man or woman to be naked in a private house'. He also suggested he would 'not expect a protection officer to question ages' of young girls because of the difficulties involved. 'Every day of the week, clubs or bars are being fooled and duped,' added the retired chief superintendent. 'Protection officers are there purely to ensure their [the royals'] safety. Their role does not include questions of morality. The only compromise to this is, of course, if there is a question of legality. Then I would expect the protection officer to take advice from a senior officer or supervisor.' The royal (left) with Virginia Roberts, then 17, (centre) and Ghislaine Maxwell (right) in early 2001 . Mr Prentice said no officer approached him with concerns about Andrew's conduct when he led the protection squad from 1998 to 2005. 'If a protection officer comes to a supervisor [about a royal's behaviour] we would advise them and not turn a blind eye,' he added. 'But if you never hear of anything you don't know if a blind eye has been turned [by the protection officer].' Andrew was pictured with Epstein in February 2011 after the billionaire was released from jail after serving time for paedophile offences. The ensuing scandal forced the prince to cut his ties with the American. But the controversy was reignited last week by the release of US court papers on the Epstein case. In the files, Miss Roberts claims Epstein forced her to have sex with Andrew three times in 2001 – in London, New York and on the billionaire's Caribbean island. She and other alleged victims want to overturn a deal that Epstein struck with federal prosecutors that saw him jailed for 18 months in 2008 for under-age sex offences. Buckingham Palace has repeatedly insisted that for Andrew 'any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue'. Mr Alessi confirmed that Miss Roberts, who is a mother of three, was a visitor to Epstein's Palm Beach mansion. His comments come from unpublished extracts of an interview with the Daily Mail in 2011. Hundreds of under-age girls are said to have been abused at Epstein's mansion, including Ms Roberts (pictured) Security sources suggest that Andrew's gallivanting around the world with Epstein, 61, cost taxpayers well over half a million pounds of public money. The duke allegedly spent several weeks at Epstein's Florida mansion and also visited his sumptuous property in New York and shared holidays with him in Thailand, New Mexico and the Caribbean. Sources confirmed the total bill in the decade up to 2011 is conservatively estimated to be £500,000. The figure is made up of business class air fares, hotel bills, salaries and overtime. Epstein has branded all his accusers liars and gold diggers. Scotland Yard declined to comment when asked whether royalty protection officers had raised concerns about Prince Andrew's conduct with Epstein or about his visits to the paedophile's Palm Beach mansion. It said: 'We do not discuss matters of security and protection.' Mr Prentice insisted it was not true that the generous pay protection officers receive would make them reluctant to jeopardise their position by challenging the behaviour of a royal or reporting it to a senior officer. 'That's high risk. When the truth comes out – and it always comes out - their days are numbered,' he said. Additional reporting: Andrew Levy and Rebecca Camber .

"Jennifer Lopez uses it as make-up remover, Beyoncé coats her eyelashes with it and, last week, actress Joan Collins revealed she dabs a little on her heels and elbows to soften her driest areas. So what is this miracle, multi-purpose product? Vaseline! Pots of the £1.99 petroleum jelly are a firm fixture in most of Britain’s bathroom cabinets and can be used for much more than soothing dry, chapped lips. Scroll down for video . Joan Collins (pictured) uses the petroleum jelly product on her heels and elbows to soften up dry areas . Here, we reveal the most unusual uses for this wonder product... BOOST EYELASHES . Instead of layering on lashings of mascara, follow Beyoncé and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini’s lead and apply a little Vaseline to lashes for a full and shiny look. This works especially well if you have naturally long eyelashes. If not, use a thickening mascara first, then apply the Vaseline on top. MAKE SKIN SHINE . Freida Pinto (pictured) is said to be a big fan of using Vaseline on her eyelids and cheekbones to give extra shine and glow . Make-up artist Mary Greenwell — whose Hollywood clientele includes actresses Uma Thurman and Cate Blanchett — is never without her trusty pot of Vaseline in her make-up kit. ‘If you want a really wonderful glowing look, it’s the perfect product, as it will pick up the light where you want it to. It gives just the right amount of shine and creates a glowing, gorgeous, nude effect,’ she says. ‘Build colour up before, then dab it on top of the eyelids and cheekbones to give extra sheen, shine and glow, without adding more colour.’ Bollywood beauty Freida Pinto is a fan of the technique to create her dewy look. PERFECT PARTY LOOK . Mixing eyeshadow and Vaseline can create some great make-up effects for a night out . Combine a touch of Vaseline with your favourite eyeshadow and the possibilities are endless. Apply a touch of the jelly on the top of the shadow on your eyelid and blend outwards: this allows the colour to ‘travel’, making a smoky, subtle effect. Or mix the shadow powder with Vaseline before you apply the colour to create a cream-based product, giving longer-lasting colour. MAKE YOUR LIPPY STICK . Beyoncé (pictured) is a big fan of using Vaseline on her teeth to stop lipstick smudging on them . Another firm favourite of Beyoncé’s is a quick and generous smear of Vaseline all over the front teeth. This isn’t to get a brighter smile — Vaseline doesn’t have any whitening properties — but the gel acts as a barrier to protect against the dreaded lipstick-to-teeth migration. FOR HAIRY MOMENTS . From frizzy to fried to fuzzy, Vaseline is the answer to all haircare conundrums. For pesky fly-aways after blow-drying or straightening, warm a little Vaseline in between fingers and smooth over the hair. Top hairdresser Lee Stafford also recommends the same trick to inject moisture into split-ends in need of a miracle. And don’t forget the classic trick of dabbing some on your hairline before dying your hair to avoid any fetching purple face stains, too. TAME UNRULY EYEBROWS . Try two bizarre beauty ideas in one — use the classic old toothbrush trick to comb through your brows, followed by a slathering of Vaseline to keep bushy hairs at bay. MAKE YOUR MANICURE LAST . Use Vaseline to smarten up a fading manicure by putting a quick slick on each nail to improve the shine . Any manicurist will argue the importance of soft and supple cuticles for a healthy, strong set of nails. All it takes is a Vaseline application directly to the nail bed once a week to keep your cuticles looking great. Nail polish losing its shine? A quick slick of Vaseline on each nail will freshen up your manicure in a flash. EASY HAIR REMOVAL . Want razors to last longer? Apply a thin layer of Vaseline to the blade to prevent moisture from the shower reacting with the metal, which causes the build up of rust. Or for those who prefer waxing, apply Vaseline to skin post-wax for a cooling effect. TREAT PSORIASIS AND ECZEMA . Supermodel Alek Wek (pictured) has struggled with psoriasis since she was a child and uses Vaseline to ease the skin irritation . The impenetrable moisturising barrier between the skin and bacteria that is created by applying layers of Vaseline makes the jelly the perfect skin saviour — for even the angriest of ailments. Supermodel Alek Wek has suffered from the itchy skin condition psoriasis since childhood and found Vaseline to be ‘the only thing that really worked’ to ease her irritation. The £2 tub has also proven effective in soothing flare-ups of nasty skin conditions, from eczema to nappy rash. STOP BLEEDING . American chemist Robert Augustus Chesebrough (pictured) discovered petroleum jelly in 1859 . When it was discovered in 1859 by English-born American chemist Robert Augustus Chesebrough, petroleum jelly was celebrated as a ‘wonder-jelly’ that miraculously healed cuts and burns. More than 150 years later, cosmetic doctor and skincare expert Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh believes the true wonder of Vaseline still lies with this original discovery. ‘It can be a temporary “healing plaster” after minor burns or abrasions injuries,’ he says. ‘Air does not pass through it, so it’s useful to seal wounds and help stop infections reaching the damaged area.’ Cosmetic doctor and skincare expert Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh says vaseline can be a 'temporary ""healing plaster"" after minor burns or abrasion injuries' He even recommends it as an effective therapeutic product for the aftercare of a cosmetic procedure — in particular, following laser peels. The lack of perfumes or colourants in the standard Vaseline formula means there’s a considerably reduced risk of irritation to any open wound. PS...AND YOU CAN EVEN USE IT TO SHINE YOUR SHOES! Vaseline’s uses go further than purely cosmetic. Use it to ease off rings stuck on fingers, or to open a tightly screwed-on nail varnish lid. You can also use it to remove chewing gum from wood and to add the shine back to patent-leather shoes.","Beyoncé uses it on her eyelashes and teeth while Joan Collins uses it to soften up dry skin .

"A young couple were left stunned after an elaborate wedding proposal ended with a surprise appearance from U2 frontman, Bono. Cliff Henry, 30, had arranged to pop the question to his childhood sweetheart Fiona Hehir during a trip to Killiney Hill overlooking Dublin Bay in Ireland. Unbeknown to Miss Hehir, Cliff had enlisted the help of Dublin-based band Keywest, who had agreed to perform a rendition of her favourite song, Raglan Hill, once the couple reached the top. Henry, a longtime fan of Keywest, ran into the group on Grafton Street in Dublin and after watching them perform told them about his plans to propose on October 29, which was Fiona’s 30th birthday. He had even organised a covert film crew to capture the moment. When Keywest dedicated the song to ‘Fiona and Cliff’, he went down on one knee.

"The new chef on the BBC's flagship programme 'Food and Drink' has ruffled feathers when he admitted to eating a puffin bird on a trip to Iceland. Tom Kerridge, 41, who landed the job as co-host for Food and Drink on BBC Two this year, revealed how he was 'en route to a puffin lunch'. He later said: 'Today I've eaten puffin, guillemot, whale and horse', before adding 'gotta love food experiences'. BBC TV chef Tom Kerridge has been criticised for admitting to eating a puffin bird on a trip to Iceland . The puffin is one of the world's favourite birds and campaigners blasted the chef for eating one in Iceland . This year, Mr Kerridge, 41, was promoted to become the new co-host for Food and Drink on BBC Two . But the TV chef, who began cooking as an 18-year-old commis chef in his native Gloucestershire, was blasted by animal campaigners last night. Mimi Bekhechi, of the campaigning group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, told the Sun on Sunday: 'He's showing himself to be colder than the weather in Iceland.' On Twitter, Donna Brown wrote: 'Puffins are endangered Tom, poor show mate even for a chef.' There are more than 15million puffins worldwide but numbers are declining rapidly. In the UK puffins are protected on the amber list of Birds of Conservation Concern. Bird charity the RSPB said puffins are 'protected at all times' - which means they are safeguarded by law. In a tweet to his 119,000 followers, he listed exotic foods he had eaten saying 'gotta love food experiences' He was criticised by campaigners and people on Twitter, such as Donna Brown who said it was a 'poor show' Another, Tracey Brooks, expressed disappointment at his decision to eat the protected bird in the UK . Since starting out as a commis chef, Mr Kerridge quickly climbed up the industry ladder and opened his own gastropub, the Hand and Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in 2005.

A total of 42 viewers complained to Ofcom in 2008 when Gordon Ramsay caught and ate a puffin on his Channel 4 show, the F word. Ramsay went 'sky fishing' for the puffins using a large net to 'fish' the birds out of the sky . Their necks were broken and they were skinned, with their hearts then taken out to eat. Iceland has the world's largest puffin breeding colony. In the country, whale meat is commonly found on menus to the consternation of some tourists. It is usually soaked first in milk to extract some of the oil and then served as medallions or streaks. Puffin and guillemot - which once saved destitute Icelanders from starvation - are now considered something of a delicacy. A particular favourite is smoked puffin, which is served up with a blueberry sauce. A spokesman for Mr Kerridge told the Sun on Sunday: 'Tom would never knowingly eat an endangered species. He is aware that puffin are not endangered in Iceland.' MailOnline has contacted the BBC for a contact.","Chef sampled Iceland's culinary delicacies saying 'love food experiences'

"The nation's highest-ranking military officer joined those calling for the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Fox News Sunday he believes that closing the prison is in the national interest.

'It does create a psychological scar on our national values. Whether it should or not, it does,' he added. Dempsey appeared on the show as Sunday marked the 13th anniversary of the opening of detention facilities at the base. There are currently 127 prisoners in the facility, though the US recently transferred a number of detainees as it tries to close the prison, a campaign pledge made by President Obama back in 2008. Dempsey said there about a dozen detainees 'simply will not be released' and stated what to do with them will come down to a policy decision for officials if they cannot be brought to the US. The Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman also touched on the ongoing conflict in Syria and Iraq involving Islamic extremist group ISIS, saying its own violent nature will eventually drive away its members. According to Dempsey, the US also had the capability to strike Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria if ordered by President Obama. He was cautious on the future of Afghanistan, saying 'there will be pockets of that country that change hands from time to time.' 'We’re going to have to keep an eye on them,' he said.

"Cheat: Susan Elaine Flanagan, 56, claimed £138,000 from the UK taxpayer despite living in Tunisia . A mother fraudulently raked in more than £138,000 from the UK taxpayer - while living in Tunisia with her two youngest children. Susan Elaine Flanagan, 56, even set up a blog called 'A Brit making a life in Tunisia', posting about a catering business she had set up. Flanagan claimed the benefits between May 2006 and November 2012 on the basis she was living in Prenton, Wirral, even though she had moved her family to the north African country. She claimed Income Support, Child Benefit and Disability Living Allowance in the UK - and later made additional claims for Employment Support Allowance and Child Tax Credit. After suspicions were raised in 2012 following a tip-off and her benefits were stopped, she returned to the UK and was arrested. Investigations showed she had taken her children out of school in 2006 - but when confronted over the blog posts she initially claimed they were 'a figment of her imagination', and said the content couldn't be relied upon. Flanagan insisted she only spent eight to 12 weeks at a time in Tunisia where she rented a property and denied doing anything wrong. It was only after lengthy investigations, carried out by the Department of Work and Pensions, which included translating stamps on her passport from Arabic and going through her bank account transactions - that she finally admitted her crimes. Flanagan has now pleaded guilty to five offences of failing to notify a change of circumstance and failing to disclose information. At Liverpool Crown Court on Friday, Philip Astbury, defending, said his client had not been living the 'life of Riley' in Africa. But Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said money goes a lot further in Tunisia than in Britain, adding that her blog suggested she ate out at restaurants, had people entertaining at her home and was living 'an enjoyable lifestyle'. The court heard Ms Flanagan - who arrived in a mobility scooter - began making legitimate benefit claims in 1993, including disability living allowance on the grounds she had extensive mobility restrictions. Flanagan, pictured  arriving at Heathrow Airport from Tunisia, was caught out after she returned to the UK, but when confronted over the blog posts she initially claimed they were 'a figment of her imagination' But they became fraudulent in 2006 when she took her two children out of school and moved from her home to start a new life in Monastir, Tunisia. Mr Slack said that over the following six-and-a-half years she continued living in Africa, with a pattern of spending several months to a year there at a time, with occasional return visits to her Prenton home, usually for a week or two before flying back out to Tunisia. In 2009 she submitted a claim for child tax benefit, filling in a form saying she lived in the UK. Two years later an Income Support review form was filled in to allow her to continue claiming, which the prosecution said appeared to have been completed by someone else at her request as she was in Tunisia at the time. In early 2012, Flanagan submitted a further form for Employment Support Allowance, on which she gave her Prenton address but declined to provide a mobile number - and also requested three weeks notice for any face-to-face assessment. Mr Slack said: 'She said she would need that time for a carer to accompany her to an interview. The crown suggests that was to allow her time to come back from Tunisia.' Defending, Mr Astbury said it was an 'unusual' case as she would have been entitled to those benefits if she had been living in the UK, and said it hadn't been a cynical and calculated plan but something she fell into and let continue. He said his client was a woman of previous good character who was remorseful, and said that due to her chronic medical condition a custodial sentence would be difficult to deal with. Sentencing, Recorder Paul Reid QC said Flanagan had chosen to abuse the system and enjoy that lifestyle choice with the assistance of benefits she was receiving in the UK, and said the picture her blog painted was of an enjoyable life in Tunisia. Rejecting the possibility of a suspended sentence, he jailed her for 12 months, reduced from 16 for her guilty pleas. She was also ordered to pay back £4,000, the only amount available for confiscation, within two months.","Susan Flanagan claimed  £138,000 in benefits while living in Tunisia .

"A group of North Korean journalists could cancel a trip to Britain because officials in the secretive regime are paranoid about the spread of Ebola, it is claimed. The group had been expected to travel to the UK to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the British media in a course part-funded by the UK taxpayer. But now North Korea's strict Ebola-control measures risk thwarting a project which had been criticised as simply teaching the regime's spin doctors how to more effectively peddle propaganda. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspecting a newly-built Mushroom Farm in Pyongyang: A plan for 46 North Korean journalists to visit the UK could be thwarted by the country's tight Ebola control measures . North Korea has been under effective lockdown for more than three months to keep the Ebola virus from crossing its borders, with all arrivals facing 21 days quarantine before they can enter the country. Since the Ebola measures were announced in late October, visas for nonessential travel have been halted and North Korean media has launched a daily barraage of constant reports depicting the dangers of the disease. North Korea's journalistic exchange trip appears to be the latest victim of the arguably over-enthusiastic health protection measures, according to a report in the the Sunday Express which cited 'Foreign Office sources'. The paper had earlier broken news of the expected visit by 46 journalists, who work in North Korea's tightly controlled state media and, its report claims, face execution if they dare criticise their country's regime. Lord Alton of Liverpool, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on North Korea, told reporters Caroline Wheeler and Alex Stevenson a cancellation could help the ministers avoid embarrassment . 'The Foreign Office might see it as a blessing in disguise if they can be given a reason for reconsidering giving a group of people whose speciality is propaganda rather than journalism the opportunity of coming to the UK,' he said. 'I think it has less to do with Ebola and more to do with the insecurity of the regime and their determination to try to prevent any influence by foreigners, aid workers or diplomats.' Kim gives field guidance to managers at the mushroom farm: The group had been expected to travel to the UK to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the British media . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office last month it is funding the project, which will be delivered by the Thomson Foundation and is called 'Inside Out: Working in North Korea to connect its journalists to an internet world.' It was claimed it could cost the UK taxpayer as much as £70,000, but the FCO said no figures for the course had been finalised, and said it was being run as part of the 'critical engagement' activities with the country. In a written answer to the House of Lords Baroness Anelay of St Johns said 'The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting.' North Korea is one of the most controlled media environments in the world. All news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored. There is just one news agency, the North Korean Central News Agency, that operates throughout the country. Internet access is poor, with many north Koreans only able to access a form of an intranet. Radios and televisions supplied to North Koreans come pre-tuned to Government-controlled stations such as Korean Central Television. Since Kim Jong-un took over from his father in 2011 there have been attempts to improve media access and information flowing from the country. This has included an interview Dennis Rodman gave to CNN after travelling to the country earlier this year, following a previous trip where he struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim Jong-un. But a lot of the news coming from North Korea appears to be tightly stage-managed. Information about the country's economic difficulties or famines are not generally reported to domestic audiences. She added: 'The project aims to expose participants to the UK media, instructing them on international reporting practices and the development of technical skills to build websites using a variety of international sources.' The students took part in a pilot workshop in Pyongyang in October and the study tour to the UK was expected take place in the coming weeks. North Korea has one of the most restrictive attitudes to the media in the world, precisely controlling information coming into and out of the country. Journalists have to be a member of the Workers' Party and prove that they come from families with reliable political backgrounds. There is just one agency service for the country. A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'The UK has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of horrifying human rights violations in North Korea. Last month, the international community condemned these abuses with a strong resolution in the United Nations. 'This project is an example of the type of international exposure recommended by the UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights in the DPRK. It is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in North Korea.' A United Nations report earlier this year found that North Koreans are not able to express opinions that are critical of the regime or its official ideology. It said: 'There is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association.' The report said that propaganda is used by the State to create obedience to the leader and that no expression of criticism of the political system goes unpunished, with public executions and people being sent to prison camps known as the 'ultimate' punishments. An example of the extent the state controls the press was seen when Kim Jong-il died in 2011, but it took two days for news of the death of the former leader to be released.","Ebola-control measures have put the paranoid state on total lockdown .

"Salvage experts believe that the AirAsia jet which crashed into the sea with 162 people on board exploded on impact. Suryadi Supriyadi, a director with the Indonesian national search and rescue agency, suggested initial analysis of the wreckage showed that the aircraft shattered because the cabin had not depressurised when it slammed into the water, Sky reported. Mr Supriyadi said: 'The cabin was pressurised and before the pressure of the cabin could be adjusted, it went down - boom. That explosion was heard in the area.' A team of navy divers earlier on Monday retrieved the flight data recorder from the wreckage. Divers have also found the second black box, but they have not yet been able to free it from debris on the floor of the Java Sea. Scroll down for video . Chief of the National Transportation Safety Board Tatang Kurniadi (left) speaks to the media while showing the flight data recorder that was retrieved from the first black box . Indonesian army and naval personnel look at the flight data recorder that was in the first black box . Associated Press reported that Mr Supriyadi confirmed the cockpit voice recorder was located on Monday just hours after officials announced that the other black box - the data flight recorder - had been brought to the surface. He said the second black box was stuck under heavy wreckage, and divers are now working to lift it. The flight recorder monitors data such as airspeed and the aircraft's heading, while the cockpit voice recorder stores radio transmissions and sounds from within the cockpit. Sky's Beijing Correspondent Mark Stone said: 'Experts will be looking at data which recorded the performance of the engines or other instrument in the cockpit. All of that will be taken to Jakarta and analysed in great detail. 'The conversations the crew had with ground control units in Singapore and Indonesia are already known, but they do not know what conversations took place on the flight deck. The flight data recorder that was in the first retrieved black box is placed on a table for the media to see . Indonesian military police carry the flight data recorder through Iskandar air base in Pangkalan Bun, Central Borneo . 'They know there was no Mayday issued and the cockpit recorder, when it is found, could reveal why.' Searchers began zeroing in on the sites a day earlier after three Indonesian ships picked up intense pings from the area. The flight data recorder was brought to the surface by four divers early on Monday morning. The cockpit voice and flight data recorders are vital to understanding what brought Flight 8501 down on December 28, killing all 162 people on board. Officials said last week when the recorders were found they would be taken to Jakarta for analysis. It could take up to two weeks to download data, investigators said, although the information could be accessed in as little as two days if the devices are not badly damaged. The news comes after the tail section of the AirAsia aircraft was pulled from the sea off the coast of central Borneo on Saturday. A photograph emerged on Sunday of an AirAsia search team member appearing to be pose in front of the downed jet's tail.

Indonesia AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lost contact with air traffic control in bad weather on December 28, less than halfway into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. None of the 162 people on the aircraft survived. So far 48 bodies have been recovered from the site, including at least two still strapped into their seats. Many of the other passengers are believed to be inside the wreckage of the plane's main cabin, which has not been located, due to strong currents moving debris around. At two weeks, most corpses will sink, said Anton Castilani, head of Indonesia's disaster identification victim unit, and there are already signs of serious decomposition. 'Divers have reached the tail part but ... the visibility was below one metre so they only managed to retrieve various debris,' said Bambang Soelistyo, chief of Indonesia's search and rescue agency. 'Now we are waiting for the speed of the current to ease. If it gets calmer later, they will go back to do another dive to determine whether the black boxes remained in the tail or were detached,' Mr Soelistyo said.

Mr Marsma Supriyadi, operations coordinator for the National Search and Rescue Agency said earlier on Sunday a sonar scan had revealed an object measuring 10 metres by four metres by 2.5 metres on the sea floor. 'They suspect it is the body of the plane. There is a big possibility that the black box is near the body of the plane,' Mr Supriyadi said in the town of Pangkalan Bun, the base for the search effort on Borneo. 'If it is the body of the plane then we will first evacuate the victims. Secondly we will search for the black box.' Families of the victims whose bodies have been recovered held funeral ceremonies to lay their loved ones to rest. Family members and friends buried their bodies and lay flowers over the graves, bringing photos of the victims to lay at memorial sites. The recovery operation comes as news that the families of the victims of the flight will be offered $US100,000 in compensation by the airline. An offer of $US24,000 was presented to family members, who were given a draft letter from AirAsia, which detailed its initial compensation deal, CNN reported.

Family members have been left confused about the letter's wording and raising issue with the airline approaching families separately in relation to compensation, the Wall Street Journal reported. But Indonesia AirAsia's director of safety and security defended the isolated discussions to The Strait Times on Tuesday, saying: 'We respect that [some] families are still hoping to see that their relatives survived, so we offered [compensation first] to those whose family members have been identified'. Captain Raden Achmad Sadikin added the airlines would be compensating families in line with Indonesian policy. According to the regulatory body that is responsible for Indonesia's finance sector, agencies that insure airlines were liable to give 1.25 billion rupiah for every one of the 155 passengers including 315 million rupiah to 750 million rupiah for the 25 passengers who bought flight insurance. Just before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic. No distress signal was issued. Indonesian aviation authorities have denied officials took bribes to allow airlines to alter their flight schedules amid allegations some were paid to approve unscheduled take-offs, including that of crashed AirAsia flight QZ8501.

"Three garages in the West Midlands have slashed petrol prices to 99.7p a litre - the lowest its been in five years . Motorists can buy petrol for less than £1 a litre for the first time in five years after three garages in the West Midlands slashed their prices to 99.7p. The owner of the independent Harvest Energy stations knocked 6p off the price of his petrol this afternoon after becoming fed up of supermarkets 'cheating' customers with rip-off costs. More stations are expected to follow suit over the coming days as the price of oil continues to fall. Dr Velautham Sarveswaran, who runs the three petrol stations in Redditch, Walsall and Birmingham with his wife Ananthi, told MailOnline he felt compelled to lower his prices after tiring of the supermarket fuel pricing 'scandal'. 'I will still be making money by cutting prices and my customers wanted to see me break the £1 barrier. My customers are happy,' he said. 'People travel as far as 20 miles just for my petrol prices. 'The supermarkets continue to make a fortune without passing the price cuts to their customers. It is a scandal. They are cheating people.' Dr Sarveswaran bought all three of his garages in 2002 after they had closed down, bringing the failed businesses back from the dead with a strategy of 'consistent low pricing'. 'The customers have been praising us for the low prices and our customer services and they keep coming back,' he said. 'We respect our customers and were willing to reduce the petrol to 99.7p. Happy customers make us happy and proud. It is a great feeling that we make the customers satisfied.' Dr Velautham Sarveswaran lowered his petrol prices to 99.7p after becoming fed up of supermarkets 'cheating' customers . More stations are expected to follow suit over the coming days as the price of oil continues to fall . The garage owner ran out of petrol three times over Christmas after lowering petrol to £1.05 and diesel to £1.12 a litre. However, the demand for his fuel is likely to be even higher after his petrol stations became the first to sell fuel for less than a £1 a litre in five years. Petrol last averaged less than £1 on May 31, 2009, when the price was 99.9p. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has fallen from $114 l in June to $49.95 on Friday – a drop of 56 per cent. The Government has demanded that petrol retailers pass on the fall in costs swiftly to consumers and petrol now averages about £1.10 a litre. The stations in Walsall, Redditch and Birmingham (pictured) lowered their prices following a steady reduction in the cost of crude oil . A graph showing the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol since 2010. Prices have been rising but began to fall from the beginning of 2014 . The wholesale price of fuel accounts for around 20 to 25 per cent of a litre of fuel at that price, with a further 57.95p in fuel duty, and VAT charged at 20 per cent, added on top. Supermarkets and fuel giants such as BP and Shell have reduced the price at the pump for the consumer however none have cut their prices to under a £1 a litre. On Tuesday Chancellor George Osborne warned airlines and power giants to pass on savings made from plummeting fuel prices to the consumer or face Government sanctions. Osborne insisted they should quickly follow the lead of petrol retailers and slash their charges following the fall in the price of oil. The Chancellor insisted it was ‘vital this was passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares’. Shock fall: After spending years mainly above $100 a barrel, oil has dived to $50 since the end of summer . The first case of swine flu had just been found in Britain, Bonkers by Dizzee Rascal was number one in the charts - and petrol cost less than £1 a litre. And while it may seem bonkers to believe, especially considering that petrol cost as much as £1.40 a litre not long ago,  May 2009 was the last time, on average, that petrol was sold at that price - until today. While  today's price cut is at just three stations, it could be a sign of good things to come. The RAC has warned since November that prices would fall below a £1 as the average cost of oil plumetted. Spokesman Simon Williams said: 'What’s currently happening at the pumps with falling fuel prices is something many motorists will not remember seeing before. 'Talk of prices going up like a rocket and falling like a feather could not be further from the truth as retailers have been quick to pass on savings at the forecourt since the RAC forecast on December 6 that prices were due to come down by 7p a litre for petrol and 6p for diesel.'","Price of petrol is slashed to less than £1 a litre for first time in five years .

The 25-year-old's newborn daughter Poppy was diagnosed with a liver disease, which only affects one in every 16,000 children, when she was just weeks old. And after undergoing a life-saving operation she may one day still need a liver transplant - which the primary school teacher,  from Darlington, is ready to give her. Doting Mum Rachel Gage has vowed that if her daughter Poppy, who suffers from a rare liver condition biliary atresia which causes inflammation of the bile ducts and liver, needs a liver transplant she will donate hers . The condition affects only one in 16,000 children and Poppy has already spent stretches of her  life in hospital . At just seven weeks old Poppy was diagnosed with biliary atresia, a rare condition in which the bile ducts in the liver become progressively blocked which leads to irreversible liver damage. And the prognosis is still uncertain, with medics saying there is an 85 per cent chance that Poppy will need a liver transplant in the next two years. Today, just a month after her operation, her mum Rachel Gage is hoping her own liver will be enough to save Poppy if she needs it. The primary school teacher, from Darlington, said: 'I would do anything for her and I would give her my liver if I could.' Poppy was born weighing just over 5lb and Rachel and her partner Dale Thomas, 26, noticed that her skin was jaundiced. Following several appointments with GPs, hospital medics made the diagnosis. Darling Poppy, who was only 5lb at birth, was diagnosed with the disease at just seven weeks old . Rachel and her partner Dale cradle their daughter Poppy who suffers from a rare liver disease . Rachel said: 'I didn't have a clue what it was then they started talking about the liver and I just broke down. 'No words could describe how I felt. We were both hoping it was something different. I just kept telling myself that everything was going to be OK.' In a harrowing moment parents Rachel and Dale kissed their daughter goodbye as they handed her over to surgeons to complete the operation. The Children's Liver Disease Foundation describe bilary atresia, which effects one in every 16,000 children, as: 'A condition in which inflammation develops within the bile ducts around the time of birth. 'The inflammation can occur in any of the bile ducts both inside and outside the liver. This leads to bile duct damage, reducing the flow of bile, which causes scarring of the liver.' The bile ducts carry bile, which is needed to digest fat in the diet, to the gut. Symptoms include pale stools, yellowed skin and potentially frequent nosebleeds. Those who suffer from bilary atresia will generally undergo the Kasai procedure'where the bile is drained from the liver into the gut. The reasons for the disease are unknown and even after the Kasai procedure is complete there is still a large risk of further issues such as bloody stools, itching and in some cases failure to thrive. 'It was awful,' said Rachel, 'We had to take her down to theatre and then we gave her a kiss goodbye. She's our little miracle.' Poppy, who is now 11-weeks-old, is doing well after the surgery to clear the build-up of bile from her liver and medics are pleased with her progress. The family are expected to be told if Poppy needs a liver transplant in the near future. Meanwhile, Rachel hopes that little Poppy's story will raise awareness of the disease.

"Inheritance tax should only be paid by the ‘rich’, George Osborne has said – in a new hint at the content of the Tory manifesto. The Chancellor suggested that the Conservatives are set to repeat the pledge made at the last election to cut the unpopular death duty. In 2010, David Cameron promised to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million, but has been blocked from introducing the policy by the Liberal Democrats as part of the Coalition agreement. George Osborne has suggested that the Conservatives are set to repeat the pledge made at the last election to cut inheritance tax . The Chancellor also repeated his insistence that – contrary to Labour claims – he has ‘no plans’ to raise VAT. Inheritance tax has remained unreformed for years and critics say that, while it was designed for the rich, hundreds of thousands of people with relatively modest properties have been dragged into the scope of the levy. The tax is now charged at 40 per cent of the value of any estate above £325,000. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Osborne said: ‘David Cameron has made it clear, as have I, that we believe inheritance tax is a tax that should be paid by the rich and we will set out our further approach closer to the election.’ Labour has repeatedly claimed that Mr Osborne is considering a post-election hike in VAT to pay for a £7billion income tax cut promised by Tories, for which no funding has yet been identified. But Mr Osborne insisted: ‘I couldn't have been clearer that our plans do not involve tax increases, including VAT, because our plans involve cutting public expenditure and saving on welfare budgets.’ Labour’s Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie (right) criticised the proposed inheritance tax reforms - while Ed Miliband (left) has accused the Tories of planning to raise VAT . Labour’s Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie criticised the proposed inheritance tax reforms. ‘The Tories are making more unfunded promises which add up to billions of pounds a year,’ he said. ‘These could only be paid for by even deeper cuts to public services or tax rises on working people. ‘George Osborne has still failed to rule out another Tory VAT rise. He simply says he has no plans to raise VAT, but that's exactly what the Tories said before the last election – a few weeks before the Tories raised VAT. ‘Labour will cut taxes for working people with a lower 10p starting rate – and we've said exactly how we'll pay for it.’","In 2010, Tories promised to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million .

"A West End play which opened this week claims Princess Diana (right) was pregnant with Dodi Fayed's (left) child when she died . A West End play which opened this week claims Princess Diana was pregnant with Dodi Fayed's child when she died in the Paris car crash. Controversial theories surrounding the Princess's life, and death, are raised in new 'factional' production Truth, Lies, Diana, which had its opening night in London on Friday. Among allegations aired in the show, which is centred on a fictional playwright investigating Diana's death, are claims she was pregnant with a 'Muslim baby' when she died on August 31, 1997. Jon Conway, who also directs and appears in the show, wrote the play using transcripts from the inquest into the Princess's death, leaked official documents and interviews with her former lover James Hewitt and butler Paul Burrell. Both are depicted in the play, which also features actors playing Dodi's father Mohammed Al-Fayed and Piers Morgan, as well as other members of the Royal family - although Diana herself is not seen on stage. Claims the Princess was pregnant were dismissed by at the inquest, but the play includes details from a testimony  Conway says was given to him by the ex-girlfriend of a doctor at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital where Diana was formally declared dead. In the play, 'Rose', a British forensic officer, is seen claiming the doctor, 'Yasser', had called another health worker on the night Diana died. 'Yasser said to him in Arabic, ""I can’t believe the news. Were you on duty?"" Then he said, ""Yes, yes... What? She was pregnant?"", she says in the play, according to the Sunday Mirror's Patrick Hill. 'The other doctor told Yasser he saw the foetus and was told never to mention it. Yasser said, ""Yes, imagine that, the King of England’s mother, pregnant with a Muslim baby"".' When asked why she and Yasser had not spoken out at the time of Diana's death because to protect their careers, but says she feels it is now time for 'the truth'. The play, which runs at the Charing Cross theatre until February 14, also includes claims  by Hewitt that Diana had discovered Prince Charles was having an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles days before their 1981 wedding, and had wanted to cancel the ceremony. Hewitt, who has given his blessing to his depiction in the show, is also seen claiming Diana knew that Prince Philip had alleged flings, but that he and the Queen had 'an arrangement'. The Princess and Dodi Fayed in the Ritz hotel on the night of the crash. The new play claims she was pregnant with a 'Muslim baby' at the time of her death - an allegation dismissed at the inquest . Jon Conway wrote the play using transcripts from the inquest into the Princess's death, leaked official documents and interviews with her former lover James Hewitt (left)  and butler Paul Burrell (right) Conway appears as writer Ray in the play, which has been described as 'semi-autobiographical' and 'factional', as well as playing Burrell - who has famously referred to himself as the Princess's 'rock'. Mohammed Al-Fayed, Morgan and Yasser are played by actor Barry Hester, while former Hollyoaks and Footballers' Wives star Kim Tiddy plays Ray's wife, an actress who helps with his research and reads out some of Diana's quotes as part of the story. Controversial theories surrounding the Princess's life, and death, are raised in new 'factional' production Truth, Lies, Diana . A summary of the show on its website states: 'A playwright uncovers secrets about Diana and her death, that the establishment have tried to keep hidden. As he does, his own life starts to unravel and he becomes paranoid, suspecting the wife he is devoted to, is being unfaithful. 'Is Ray being manipulated by the ‘men in grey’ that Diana had always maintained existed, or does no-one in their right mind believe Diana was murdered?' Conway  said: 'I think it’s important the public is able to hear the whole story. I call it the D-word as nobody wants to talk about it.' In a question and answer piece on Conway's website, he was asked 'why drag this up again now?' 'The last three years has seen dramatic reinvestigations into many old crimes, exposing covers and corruption in the past,' he said. 'Jimmy Savile, Steven Lawrence, phone hacking and so on, have vindicated witnesses previously presented as unreliable. None more relevant than the opening of a new Hillsborough inquest. This happened after the Police admitted they altered over 100 witness statements. Yet any questions about Diana’s death are swept aside or met with a wall of silence.' Respected Royal author Margaret Holder has described the claims in the play as a 'nonsense'. She said: 'I think this will put him back in the spotlight and it tells producers of reality TV programmes, “Hello, I’m here.” It’s a nonsense but it’s all a game.' Biographer Hugo Vickers said the play’s claims were not surprising given the people who had been interviewed by Conway. He said: ‘If you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle. They have an agenda of their own.’ The play had its opening night on Friday and runs at the Charing Cross theatre until February 14 .","Controversial claims made in 'factional' play Truth, Lies, Diana .

"Inflation is today set to drop below 1 per cent for the first time since June 2002 on the back of the falling price of food and fuel. The figures for December, to be published at 9.30am, will be hailed by ministers as evidence that the squeeze on family finances is finally coming to an end, with wages rising faster than prices. The fall in inflation will fuel speculation that interest rates could stay at 0.5 per cent until late this year or even until next year in a boost for millions of borrowers. Scroll down for video . Composing... Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, must write a letter to Chancellor George Osborne explaining why inflation has strayed more than one percentage point from the 2 per cent target . Bank of England governor Mark Carney must write an open letter to Chancellor George Osborne when inflation moves more than one percentage point away from the 2 per cent target. So this week he will be forced to explain why the figure is so low – paving the way for interest rates to stay at rock bottom for longer than expected. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ‘Inflation is likely to have been brought down further in December primarily by a marked fall in petrol prices … the ongoing supermarket pricing war should have continued to limit prices.’ He added: ‘With oil prices hitting new lows in January and likely to remain weak for a prolonged period and with the supermarket pricing war continuing, inflation could very well get down near to 0.5 per cent in the early months of 2015. ‘The government will be hoping that very low inflation and improving earnings growth improves its popularity in the run-up to May’s general election.’ The Bank set interest rates at 0.5 per cent for a 71st month in a row last week – prolonging the agony of low returns for savers but providing further comfort to over-stretched borrowers. Over the summer, it was thought the Bank could raise rates for the first time since 2007 before the end of 2014 or in early 2015. Happy time at the supermarket: The figures for December will be hailed by ministers as evidence that the squeeze on family finances is finally coming to an end, with wages rising faster than prices . But the sharp fall in inflation, the slowdown in the UK economy, and worries about the outlook in Europe and around the world, has dampened expectations of an early rate hike. Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, said: ‘You might have better luck picking the winner of the Grand National than you would predicting when interest rates might change. ‘The Bank of England seems content to hunker down and sit on interest rates, possibly until later this year or even early 2016.’ Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘Expectations about an early hike in interest rates by the Bank of England have cooled. UK policymakers will be in no hurry to start raising interest rates.'","Bank of England governor Mark Carney must now write to the Chancellor .

"Investigators found five guns and a laptop computer in the vehicle of a man suspected of killing three people in a shooting spree, a police chief said Sunday, but they hadn't yet uncovered any motive for the rampage. John Lee, 29, was arrested following a high-speed chase in nearby Washington state after the shootings Saturday. Police believe he opened fire at three locations in the western Idaho city of Moscow, killing his landlord, his adoptive mother and a manager at a restaurant his parents frequented. A Seattle man was also critically injured. Response: Ambulance workers rush one of the shooting victims allegedly gunned down by John Lee, 29, in Moscow, Idaho . Police: Heavily-armed officers are shown talking while comrades hunted for Lee, who was arrested after a high-speed chase . Investigators searched Lee's car and apartment late Saturday night, Moscow Police Chief David Duke said. They found two semi-automatic pistols, a revolver, a shotgun and a rifle in the vehicle, along with a laptop, he said. Ballistics tests were expected to help determine which weapons might have been used in the shootings. Authorities were seeking a warrant to search the computer, he said. 'There's still nothing to identify a specific motive as to why Mr. Lee took these actions,' Duke said. Police said Lee's killing spree began with Terri Grzebielski, 61, who had adopted him. He then allegedly tracked down his landlord, 76-year-old David Trail, and killed him too. Police say he also shot Michael Chin, 39, of Seattle during that portion of the attack. Trail died at Pullman Regional Hospital and Chin was listed in critical condition Saturday night at Gritman Medical Center in Moscow. The shooter then drove to an Arby's restaurant and asked for the manager. When she appeared, he pulled out a gun and opened fire. The manager, 47-year-old Belinda Niebuhr, died at the Moscow hospital. Duke said that Trail, the brother of a former Idaho state representative, was Lee's landlord. He said there were 'some issues' regarding the apartment, but didn't know of any eviction proceeding. Chin was discussing business with Trail when the gunman arrived. Duke said Chin was shot in the arm and leg, and would be flown to a Seattle hospital. Guard: One policeman stands outside an office where David Trail, 76, and Michael Chin, 39, were shot. Trail died from his wounds, while Chin is in critical condition in hospital . Investigators have yet to find any link between Lee and the Arby's manager. 'We know he didn't work there,' Duke said.  The chief said that the surviving workers did not recognize Lee. Kelsey Stemrich said she was working at a cafe near Arby's when she and a customer heard three gunshots and then saw people running from the restaurant. She says they took down the license plate number of a car seen pulling away from the Arby's and called it into police. Police in Washington spotted the suspect's black Honda and a chase involving multiple agencies ensued. Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins said the pursuit lasted nearly 25 miles and Lee's vehicle at times topped 100 mph before crashing off Highway 195 north of Colfax and rolling to a stop. Lee was taken to a Colfax hospital for treatment of minor injuries before he was booked into the Whitman County Jail on a charge of felony eluding. Investigators had yet to recover the gun. Duke said it was probably still in the car and detectives were awaiting a search warrant Saturday night before looking for it. Moscow authorities had yet to announce any Idaho charges late Saturday, saying the investigation remains active. Moscow is a city of about 25,000 people in northern Idaho. It's about 10 miles from Pullman, Washington. Help: Emergency medical technicians from the Moscow Volunteer Fire Department aid one of two men shot in the office building.

"The Skoda Fabia has been named Car of the Year in the motor industry 'Oscars'. The Czech company, part of Germany's Volkswagen Group, took the top prize in the awards organised by What Car? magazine, beating more upmarket rivals, including BMWs, Range Rovers, Mercedes-Benz and Porsches. The awards ceremony, at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, also saw the Fabia 1.2 TSI 90 SE, pictured right, named best small car, from a shortlist of 25. The honour repeats Skoda's feat of 15 years ago when its original Fabia won top prize. The Skoda Fabia (pictured) has been named Car of the Year in the motor industry 'Oscars' held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London . Judges praised the Fabia's turbocharged 1.2-litre petrol engine for combining 'punchy and flexible performance with impressive efficiency credentials'. It's thrifty — averaging 58.8 mpg and has emissions of just 110g/km, putting it in the road tax bracket B, which costs nothing in the first year and £20 a year thereafter. The judges said: 'It also beats its main rivals in the small car class — the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo — for both space and practicality. 'The technology that comes as standard on the Fabia includes a brilliant 6.5in touch-screen and a system that can sync with Android phones to provide satnav. 'It's one of the very few cars on sale that has no major weaknesses and when you factor in how keenly priced it is, you start to wonder how on earth Skoda turns a profit. It might not be the most exciting car in the world, but it is the most sensible.' Prices from £10,600. What Car? editor Jim Holder said: 'We've evaluated all its rivals and the Fabia is the most rounded small car on sale in the UK today.' Since VW took over the firm, Skoda has shed its joke reputation to become a serious player in the car market. And it was a double triumph for Skoda's blend of Czech style and German engineering, as its larger Octavia 1.2 TSI 105 SE was named best family car. High-end 4x4 wars have broken out as arch rivals Rolls-Royce and Bentley - both celebrating record global sales and exports - gear up to launch ostentatious off-roaders. More than 4,000 Rolls-Royces were sold last year, and boss Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes told me this week the BMWowned firm would make its final decision on entering the market this year. It is also set to launch a drophead coupe based on the Wraith. Then Bentley boss Wolfgang Duerheimer said the company had taken 4,000 pre-orders for its off-roader. Production will help propel the Crewe factory from last year's record 11,000 cars to more than 20,000 by the end of the decade, keeping German owner Volkswagen happy. Expect also a smaller 'baby' Bentley coupe and soft-top to take on the likes of Aston Martin and Maserati. Bentley's Geordie MD Michael Straughan, who this week was hob-nobbing with Germany's Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister David Cameron, has his work cut out. Watch out, too, for a much touted leap into the compact SUV market from Jaguar. Land Rover has announced a trio of limited editions of its classic Defender to mark the end of production in Britain. In December the last Defender will roll off the production lines at the firm's factory in Solihull. The Heritage edition, from £27,800, on sale from August, is inspired by the very first Land Rover and is a reinterpretation of the first pre-production Series 1 vehicle, nicknamed Huey, from 1947, taking its name from the registration plate HUE 166. Land Rover has announced a trio of limited editions of its classic Defender (pictured) to mark the end of production in Britain . The Adventure edition, pictured left, comes with expedition roof rack, snorkel and rear access ladder. Six hundred will be produced to go on sale from £43,495 in August. First out of the blocks in April will be 80 of the exclusive Autobiography range, from £61,845, for those who like to rough it in luxury. It has privacy glass, a full Windsor leather interior with ebony or ivory roof lining, and premium leather seats. To mark the launch, Land Rover also created the largest sand drawing ever in Britain — of the Defender — measuring 0.62 miles across. It was drawn by a fleet of six Land Rovers on the beach — Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey — where, in 1947, Rover's engineering director Maurice Wilks sketched out the shape of the original 4x4 to his brother Spencer, the firm's MD. However, Land Rover has reversed its original decision to kill off the much-loved classic Defender model. It will be built abroad, but outside the EU, possibly in India, South Africa or China.","The Czech company beat rivals BMW and Range Rover to win the title .

"Birds of a Feather actress Linda Robson has revealed how her son's mental health deteriorated after witnessing the fatal stabbing of his best friend Ben Kinsella. Louis, now 22, was holding 16-year-old Ben, brother of former EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella, in his arms when the ambulance arrived after the attack outside a bar in Islington, London, in 2008. Now, his mother has opened up on how the death of Ben affected Louis, and how she was told by a doctor that he needed to be sectioned. Tragedy: Linda Robson's son Louis was best friends with Ben Kinsella and present when the 16-year-old was stabbed to death in 2008, an event which sent Louis into a spiral of depression, anxiety and panic attacks . Linda Robson's son and Ben Kinsella had been best friends since the age of eight, and it was Louis  who called the ambulance and tried to stem the bleeding with his cardigan after Ben was stabbed 11 times outside a bar in Islington six years ago. ‘Louis went back to Ben. He was holding him in his arms on the floor,' Linda told the Daily Mail in 2011. 'Eventually they put him in an ambulance. Louis’s clothes were covered in Ben’s blood so he had to take them off. ‘Life changed from that day. It never goes away. You think about it all the time. Louis was diagnosed with depression and dropped out of college, but his best friend's death had affected him so profoundly that he began suffering panic attacks. Long way back: Linda and Louis, pictured on stage with Pauline Quirke, her son Charlie and Lesley Joseph in 2012, struggled in the years after Ben Kinsella's death . Murdered: Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death outside an Islington bar in 2008 . In 2013, Louis began living like 'a recluse' as his anxiety crippled him and his family. 'Me or my husband had to be around him all the time,' Linda told The Mirror. 'We couldn't go out - he'd panic if we weren't there.' A year later, Linda and her husband Mark visited a Harley Street doctor for help handling Louis' illness, and were told their son needed sectioning. 'The doctor said Louis needed to be locked up, send away and put on medication for a month.' Linda and Mark did not take up the offer, and instead sought alternative anxiety therapy for their son, who is now recovered and working on a music career. Star pupil and promising artist Ben Kinsella was stabbed 11 times in an Islington street after a night out celebrating the end of his GCSEs with a groups of friends, including Louis, in 2008. Thee men, Michael Alleyne, Jade Braithwaite, and Juress Kika, all in their late teens at the time of the stabbing, were jailed for the murder. Ben's sister, actress Brooke Kinsella, has since campaigned tirelessly for tougher knife-crime sentences since her brother was killed, working as a Government ambassador and helping to set up the Ben Kinsella Trust.","Linda Robson's son witnesses fatal stabbing of Ben Kinsella .

"A driver climbed to safety through the boot of his Mini Cooper after plunging into a freezing reservoir. Incredibly, the unnamed driver was unhurt after he swerved to avoid an object on a tight bend next to the Blue Lagoon beauty spot at Belmont, Lancashire. The car's roof could be seen above the water, with the boot open. A driver climbed to safety through the boot of his Mini Cooper after plunging into Ward's Reservoir in Belmont, Lancashire . Firefighters from Bolton North and Darwen stations and Lancashire Police went to the reservoir in Rivington Road at 10.40pm last night. When emergency services arrived the man was not in his car, but he later returned to the scene in another vehicle. Lancashire Police said the man ended up in the water after trying to avoid an object in the road and that there was no suggestion he had broken the law. The body of water, off Rivington Road, near Belmont, is officially called Ward's Reservoir, but is known locally as The Blue Lagoon. Resident Richard Guest said: 'This sort of thing happens regularly. The car's roof could be seen above the water, with the boot open after the driver swerved to avoid an object in the road . 'If you came to me every week and told me there had been an accident at the Blue Lagoon, it wouldn't surprise me. 'It's a really tight bend and if you are even slightly out of control, you're in trouble.' Another resident John Thompson added: 'It's a very dangerous road to drive on - it's terrible for vehicles, especially at night.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: 'We got a call from a member of the public at 10.40pm last night to say that there was a vehicle in the Blue Lagoon with its lights still on. 'The driver lost control of the car while trying to avoid an object in the road and the car has got into the water and sunk considerably. 'He has not suffered any injuries and there was no suggestion he had been drinking or speeding. 'We were at the scene for an hour.'

"Ministers are considering bringing out a 'beware of boar' road sign to warn drivers of the animals straying on to the road . Ministers are considering bringing out a 'beware of boar' road sign following a fatal motorway collision involving one of the wild animals last week. The new sign could be erected along stretches of roads near 'infested' areas, along with barriers to keep out the 20 stone animals. The plans, to be discussed by transport officials, follow the death of Raymond Green, who died when his car collided with a boar that had strayed onto the M4 in Wiltshire. The animal was then struck by an articulated lorry and led to the busy stretch of motorway closing for eight hours. Boars have caused crashes in the past, with France and Germany already using signs to warn drivers of the animals. The new road sign would show a red triangle with a large boar leaping across a road, the Sunday Times reported. There are already similar signs in place for warnings of cattle, wild horses or ponies, deer, ducks, toads and general 'wild animals' on the road. Roads minister John Hayes said Mr Green's death had shocked him and that he had asked transport officials to draw up a report on accidents caused by wild boar. He said: 'Road safety in the context of wild boars is an emerging issue that needs to be addressed. 'The addition of a warning sign for wild boar in areas with populations of the animals would be a sensible step to encourage people to slow down and watch out.' Scroll down for video . Boar have caused crashes in the past, with France and Germany already using signs to warn drivers of the animals . A man was killed when a boar strayed onto the M4 in Wiltshire and collided with a vehicle last week . The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates there are around 1,000 boar living wild in Britain, but some experts claim that the true figure is at least ten times that. Scientists recently found two populations of wild boar comprising up to 4,000 in the Forest of Dean Kent. Wild boar can run up to 30mph and weigh around 20 stone when fully grown. They can also jump 6ft. In 2013 people living in and around the Forest of Dean said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby. Wild boar dug up land where the ashes of loved ones were scattered at the Pan Tod Beacon beauty spot on Ruardean Hill outside Cinderford, Gloucestershire. The animals also destroyed grass verges in the area and in 2013 the Forestry Commission announced a cull on the population. In 2008 one had to be shot at Ruardean Primary School and two years later the animals destroyed a football pitch. And last week a prized Gloucestershire Old Spot pig owned by Prince Anne was killed by a boar after it broke into the pen at her Gatcombe Park estate near Avening in Gloucestershire. Wild boar were hunted to extinction in Britain several centuries ago. But their population has started to rise again after several programmes to reintroduce them in the last fifteen years. There are now thriving herds spreading out into the countryside. Boar are usually secretive and nocturnal and are likely to stay out of the way of humans. When fully grown a wild boar weighs around 20 stone and can jump 6ft. They can also travel large distances and reach speeds of 30mph. In medieval times, boar from the Royal Forest were supplied for the Royal table - there is a record of an order for 100 boar and sows for a Christmas feast in 1254. Boar are known to inhabit parts of the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean. The animals have roamed wild in the Forest of Dean in 2004, after a 700 year absence. They started to populate the wild in 1999 after several escaped from a farm and in 2004 a group of 60 were dumped - further boosting wild populations. Since then the population has grown steadily - with complaints about them digging up graveyards, gardens and grass verges. Farming of wild boar in Britain became fashionable in the 1970s and boar originating from the European mainland were kept under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976.","Transport ministers are considering a new 'beware of boar' road sign .

"Comedienne Margaret Cho was a prominent face at the 2015 Golden Globes, but not as herself. The Korean-American showed up repeatedly, alongside her co-host pals Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, in character as a North Korean general with a penchant for American entertainment. The general even got a photo op with Hollywood living legend Meryl Streep. But it couldn't save the bit from sparking outrage and ridicule. 'Still not funny. The Asian stereotyping bit still old, even pretending to be North Korean. Worst bit of the night,' tweeted @DaveSaitzyk. And his was just one of countless posts denouncing the bit. Scroll down for video . Too far? Margeret Cho appeared on the 2015 Golden Globes as a cartoonish North Korean general in love American entertainment named Cho Yung Ja . Stoking controversy?

Good sport Meryl Streep poses with Cho as Cho Yung Ja while Benedict Cumberbatch photobombs in the background during the awards show . There were giggles from Keira Knightley and Jack Black (right) but Salma Hayek did not look amused (left behind Meryl Streep) during the skit . It began at the top of the show when Fey and Poehler introduced the general. ‘The Hollywood Foreign Association comprises journalists from all around the globe and we would like to now introduce you to our newest HFPA member. A contributor to Movies Wow magazine and a North Korean army general; Cho Yung Ja. Welcome.’ Movies Wow, it turns out, features none other than supreme leader and the alleged vengeful mind behind the recent Sony email hacks--Kim Jong-un. As Cho Yung Ja, Ms Cho demanded a photo opportunity with Streep, who gamely stood with the faux soldier and smiled for a photo snapped by Michael Keaton. From behind, actor Benedict Cumberbatch leapt up for a photobomb. After the snap is taken, Fey said: ‘Thank you, crisis averted. God Bless.’ In a room full of movie stars - many affected by the embarrassing Sony hack - it all seemed like good fun. But then the Twitter reaction came. The Korean-American actress and comedian was called out on Twitter following the Sony-hack inspired bit . Cho has long imitated her South Korean immigrant mother, but some viewers were appalled by her act on Sunday night . Adding a bit of flare to her act, Cho goose-stepped off-stage following the second Cho Yung Ja bit . 'I've always loved margaret cho but she needs to stop shuckin' for white folk,' wrote @LordeBarrington. @HoJoLego agreed: 'This is the worst Margaret Cho joke ever. #GoldenGlobes' As did @BougieBlackGurl: 'Margaret Cho that was freaking awful. Is she going to shuck and jive too? #GoldenGlobes #whenthechecksstopcoming.' The tweets kept coming. Thanks for the eager naysayers, the Cho Yung Ja sketch did, too. Later in the show, Cho appeared onstage in costume and shared her thoughts on the lesbian plot line between Orange Is The New Black characters Alex and Piper, calling their relationship 'very toxic'. Margaret Cho had previously appeared in Tina Fey's creation 30 Rock as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il and his son Kim Jong-Un in 2011 (Cho is pictured left with Fey and right, with Tracy Morgan) Cho appeared in 30 Rock in 2011, the NBC comedy series created by Tina Fey. The 46-year-old actress played North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il in one episode for which she received an Emmy nominaton for Outstanding Guest Actress. She popped up again on 30 Rock, this time as the Supreme Leader's son, Kim Jong-Un. She then proceeded to goose-step off stage. And as their final act in their final Golden Globe hosting gig together, Fey and Poehler even gave Cho the last words of the entire show. 'Show over. I host next year. Good night,' she said in character as Cho Yung Ja while credits rolled.","Cho appeared repeatedly at the 2015 awards as Cho Yung Ja, an American entertainment-obsessed North Korean soldier .

Civil rights hero: The sale has sparked controversy within the family and the slain hero's friends . On Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney will either pass a deciding verdict, or let it go to trial. Martin Luther King III and Dexter Scott King, who control The Estate Of Martin Luther King Jr Inc, have agreed to sell the lucrative heirlooms to a private buyer. But their sister Bernice refused to hand over the items. Since she finally agreed to give the prize and Bible to a court in March 2014, it is believed the estate will likely win the case. This is at least the fifth lawsuit between the siblings in the past decade. But according to Bernice, but this one crosses the line. Speaking in February last year from the pulpit of historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where her father and grandfather preached, she said her father cherished these two items, which speak to the very core of who he was. Dispute: Martin Luther King III (left) and Dexter Scott King (right) say the estate needs desperate funding . Opposed: Dr Bernice King, who followed her father into preaching, said you cannot sell his Bible . The Rev. Timothy McDonald, who served as assistant pastor at Ebenezer from 1978 to 1984 and sides with Bernice but describes himself as a friend of the whole family, told The Associated Press: 'You don't sell Bibles and you don't get but one Nobel Peace Prize. There are some items that you just don't put a price on.' The estate's lawyers have not responded to requests for comment from the King brothers. At a hearing last year, a lawyer who represented the estate at the time said they want to sell the two items because the estate needs the money. Paying lawyers to enforce the rights to King's words and image is expensive, attorney William Hill reminded the judge, drawing chuckles. The estate is a private entity, so its finances aren't public, and court records don't elaborate on the estate's need for cash. Whether to sell the Bible and the medal is not up to the judge, or even part of the lawsuit, which is purely an ownership dispute. Lawyers for Bernice have argued, among other things, that King gave the Nobel medal to his wife as a gift, meaning that it is part of Coretta Scott King's estate. Bernice is the administrator of her mother's estate. Family dispute: The battle is the fifth to rip between the King family since Dr Martin Luther King Jr died . King's heirs have previously parted with parts of his legacy. They sold a collection of more than 10,000 of his personal papers and books in 2006 for $32 million, a collection now housed at Morehouse College, King's alma mater. Two separate appraisers, Leila Dunbar and Clive Howe, told the AP they would expect the medal to sell for about $5 million to $10 million, and possibly more, based on what other Nobel medals have gone for and King's place in history. Dunbar said she would expect the Bible to sell for at least $200,000 and possibly more than $400,000. Howe said it would probably go for about $1 million. If they are sold through a private sale, which can bring substantially higher sums from buyers who want to secure items before they get to auction, the medal alone could fetch $15 million to $20 million, Howe said. Both items have enormous societal value and should be on public display, said Barbara Andrews, director of education and interpretation at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. The Bible is important because of who King was, and the Nobel Peace Prize because of what it signified — that the fight for civil rights was being recognized on a world stage, she said. While museums and books can talk about the medal, being able to see it renders it tangible, 'more than a photograph, more than us just talking or writing about it,' Andrews said. 'We like to own things. We like to touch things. We like to see them with our eyes. It satisfies that need in us to see the physical manifestation of the award.' Even in the hands of Bernice, though, neither item has regularly been available to the public. Both 'are in the same places they have been for years. The Peace Prize medal is located in a safe deposit box in possession of the King family, and the King Bible is in a safe and secure location' known to Bernice and her brothers, her lawyers wrote in response to the lawsuit. A replica of the medal has been on display at the King Center for about 17 years, but it's unclear when the medal itself was last shown, King Center spokesman Steve Klein said. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis in 1968. Among his children, Martin III got his father's name, while Dexter got his looks. Other battles: The brothers have also tried to stop their sister using Dr King's image and memorabilia . Bernice followed her father into the ministry and shares his gift for public speaking. And the firstborn, Yolanda, was known as a peacekeeper. Even before she died in 2007, though, the siblings had taken their quarrels public and gone through periods where they didn't speak to each other. In December 2005, Bernice and Martin successfully fought a push by Yolanda and Dexter, who along with other trustees of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change wanted to sell it to the National Park Service. In 2008, two years after the death of their mother and a year after Yolanda died, a long-simmering dispute between the surviving siblings boiled over, with three lawsuits filed between them in as many months. In August 2013 — on the 50th anniversary of King's 'I Have a Dream' speech — the estate asked a judge to stop the King Center, where Bernice is the CEO, from using his image, likeness and memorabilia, arguing that the center wasn't caring for King artifacts properly. That case is pending.","Martin Luther King III and Dexter Scott King plan to sell their father's Bible and 1964 Nobel Peace Prize to a private buyer .

"Two members of the Tuskegee Airmen - the famed all-black squadron that flew in the Second World War - died on the same day, in the same city, both at the age of 91. Clarence E. Huntley Jr and Joseph Shambrey died on January 5 in their respective homes - both in Los Angeles. They were lifelong friends who joined the army together as teenagers. The men enlisted in 1942 and were deployed to a fighter squadron as mechanics, who kept the planes in combat-ready shape. Veteran: Clarence E. Huntley Jr, pictured above posing with a Mustang fighter plane in 2011, passed away on January 5, the same day as his war buddy . Same day: Joseph Shambray, pictured above in 2000, joined up with Huntley at the same time - and also died on the same day, at the identical age of 91 . Their families, who announced the deaths Sunday, described the men as devout patriots who cared deeply for their fellow soldiers and stayed close with many of their war buddies. Huntley and  Shambrey were part of the 100th Fighter Squadron in the Army Air Force's 332nd Fighter Group. They trained at the Tuskegee Army Airfield in Alabama, which gave the group their moniker. Huntley serviced Mustang, Thunderbolt and Aircobra fighters aircraft, and as crew chief was responsible for the plane of the squadron commander, Capt. Andrew D. Turner. Huntley's nephew, Craig, said: 'The life of his pilot was in his hands, and he took that very seriously,' his nephew said. History: The Tuskegee Airmen, who trained at the Tuskegee airfield in Alabama, were a famed all-black flying squadron . Air-ready: In the above archive photo , 20 airmen receive their commissions at a ceremony in Tuskegee, Alabama, before heading to Europe to fight the Nazis . Airborne: A bomber plane is seen above taking off from Fort Knox, Kentucky, on a training flight in 1944 . His concern led Turner to nickname him 'Mother,' Huntly said. In addition to facing danger, the Tuskegee Airmen faced racism. Shambrey's son, Tim Shambrey of Altadena, said his father recalled getting off a train in Alabama where a hospitality station was welcoming returning white troops with handshakes and free coffee. 'When he and his buddies came off, dressed in their uniforms, of course they didn't get any congratulations' and were asked to pay for their coffee, Shambrey said. They did so. Happy return: Seven servicemen are pictured above landing in New York City in July 1945, after the war in Europe had been won . Still going strong: This 2012 photograph shows four former pilots - Lt. Colonel Washington Ross, Lt. Col. Alexander Jefferson, Lt. Col. Harry Stewart and Colonel Charles McGee - posing in front of a Tuskegee fighter plane . 'The thing about those men is that they were very proud' and decided not to make a fuss, Shambrey said. 'They were already used to so much discrimination.' In later life, Shambrey didn't talk much about his war service but he held barbecues that sometimes drew 150 people, including a lot of his old Army buddies, his son said. Huntley also didn't talk much with his family about the war, said his daughter, Shelia McGee of Los Angeles. He told them: 'I was doing what I was supposed to do, and that was to serve my country,' she said. Shambrey was a National Guard combat engineer during the Korean War and later spent his career with the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation, his son said. Huntley was a skycap for more than 60 years at airports in Burbank and Los Angeles, his daughter said.","Clarence E Huntley Junior and Joseph Shambrey both died in Los Angeles .

"New York City bars have complained anti-booze campaigners are trying to drive them out of business on the Lower East Side. The group - who at the end of last year released a 12-minute video of drunken revelry and destruction in NYC's 'Hell Square' - are said to seize on every minor violation as an excuse to call in the authorities. The two blocks in the Lower East Side, saturated with bars, are a go-to destination for Manhattan dwellers on a night out. Infuriated with the 'demonic possession' of the area, the 12-minute YouTube video from December by neighborhood group LES Dwellers has been designed to drive the partygoers out. 'Hell Square': A video taken in New York City's Lower East Side at 3.30am displayed typical drunken antics . It is a campaign that has sparked outrage among bars between Ludlow Street and Rivington Street who claim the group is spoiling the fun and needlessly trying to hamper their business. Taken at around 3.30am on December 21, the video shows a street fight break out, a woman sprawled on the floor, and one man screaming 'PASTRAMI!' for no apparent reason. A couple slam against a wall after being refused entry to a bar, opting instead to entertain themselves. Police watch, unsurprised, as they systematically arrest people for brawling. And one man faces a difficult battle to publicly urinate while struggling to stay awake. Tumble: This woman could barely speak, had fallen over, ripped her jeans, and took two minutes to stand up . Say it like you mean it: Among the crowds, this man was screaming 'pastrami' for no apparent reason . Arrests: Three fights broke out in the space of 12 minutes leaving police to follow and make arrests . The group, which was founded in 2012, said in a statement: '[This] illustrate[s] how bad the Lower East Side's Hell Square continues as late night bars and clubs continue to foster a SantaCon-style environment of binge drinking, public urination and vomiting, brawls and arrests every weekend. 'What is depicted in the videos is not outside the norm but is the norm. The bars, lounges and restaurants in this area over serve alcohol creating a dangerous environment. 'This weekend was an outrage—ranking as one of the worst on record: It was SantaCon without the costumes. He's hit a wall: This man became embroiled in a difficult battle to stay awake while publicly urinating . 'Assaults and crime are up in our neighborhood due solely to the proliferation of late night liquor licenses in the neighborhood.' But Robert Bookman, counsel to the New York City Hospitality Alliance, told the New York Post, the LES Dwellers are not welcomed by all residents. 'They go for the jugular,' he said. 'They go above and beyond any other community groups I've ever seen. They'll bring up violations you had five years ago.'","Lower East Side neighborhood group LES Dwellers took 12-minute film .

"Much like finding a flattering pair of jeans, mascara is something we spend our whole lives trying to get right. But with new formulations and wand shapes promising everything from a false lash effect to a 360-degree curl, it’s hard to know which one is best for you. Here, Leah Hardy tests the new High Street and high-end mascaras. DRAMATIC DEFINITION . Max Factor created the mascara wand in 1958 and its new Masterpiece Transform, £9.99, has a slim, flexible wand with narrow bristles to coat each lash from root to tip. It clumps slightly at the root so takes a couple of coats to fan out my lashes, but the extra effort is worth it. I look as if I am wearing eyeliner because of the volume it creates. This mascara makes me look brighter and more awake, and lasts all day without flaking or smudging. However, it may be too much for daytime. 4/5 . OLD FAVOURITE . The updated formula of this make-up bag favourite, Maybelline Great Lash BIG, £4.99, in its distinctive green and pink packaging, has a bumper-size brush that promises bigger, more dramatic lashes. Yes, it gives long, defined lashes that take only seconds to achieve, but it’s not particularly volumising. The colour is jet black and clump-free, and it is a bargain price. However, this mascara does flake as the day goes on, and proves stubborn to remove. 3/5 . FABULOUS FLUTTER . Estee Lauder Sumptuous Bold Volume Lifting Mascara, £21, has tiny fibres that are said to plump lashes and a chunky, tapered wand designed to thicken and define. It creates, soft, feathery lashes as I layer it on. It looks as though I have more lashes, rather than simply thicker ones. I received lots of compliments when wearing this mascara — even from my husband! — and it lasted all day. My favourite. 5/5 . NICE AND NATURAL . The latest L’Oreal mascara, Volume Million Lashes So Couture, £10.99, promises to give you flexible lashes. Yes, the rounded, large wand leaves my lashes strikingly longer, but it is clumpy. I love the intense black colour, which is also slightly glossy, giving a luxurious look. However, it isn’t as volumising as I expected. The brush is tricky to manage — I end up with blobs of mascara around my eyes. However, it’s brilliant at emphasising lower lashes, gives a pretty natural look rather than a high glamour one and lasts all day. 3½/5 . SMUDGE PROOF . Mac False Lashes, £19, is a make-up artist favourite, but it doesn’t have the dramatic effect I was expecting. Though my top lashes certainly look separated and fluffy, it clumps on my bottom lashes — I look as if I’m going to a Sixties fancy dress party. Though it stays in place all day without smudging, and glides off when I remove, it doesn’t live up to its false lash name. 1/5 . CURL CREATOR . With an oddly shaped curved brush, which dips in the middle to catch inner lashes and curl outer ones, Rimmel Scandal Eyes Rockin’ Curves, £6.99, is designed to give volume and lift to your upper and lower lashes without clumps. The lengthening and curling is brilliant, but the volume is nothing to write home about. The curl also drops as the day went on, so I need to top it up a few times. 3/5 . DOLL EYES . Benefit They’re Real, £19.50, is the best-selling mascara, promising every-thing from length to full-on volume. It has a narrow, rubberised brush for zig-zagging between the eyelashes. And, wow, it looks as if I’ve had eyelash extensions — with only two brush strokes I have a super-long, curled, doll-eye effect. A few lashes stick together, but the overall effect is inky black and glossy. However, it takes a bit of rubbing to shift it at bedtime. 4½/5 . ULTIMATE GLAMOUR . Lancome’s Hypnose high glamour mascaras are firm favourites with beauty bloggers. The latest version, Grandiose, £24.50, has an unusual, bent ‘swan neck’ brush — which I found difficult to use — to lift and fan out lashes. It gives a false-lash effect, with instantly longer, thicker and fuller lashes that are jet black and glossy. My lower lashes look endless. It’s a bit much if you like a natural look and the thick formula means some lashes stick together. It lasts well, with minimal flaking, yet comes off easily with eye make-up remover. 4½/5 .","It's a make-up bag essential but it can be a nightmare to find the right one .

"Women at CNN are reportedly up in arms about the way the network permanently replaced one of its morning show anchors while she was on maternity leave. CNN announced Friday that Kate Bolduan, who has been on leave from New Day since September, would be permanently replaced by Alisyn Camerota, who was filling in as co-anchor in her absence. Page Six reports that staffers are upset that the network pushed out Bolduan while she was home with new baby and hold network head Jeff Zucker responsible for mishandling the switch. Out: CNN announced Friday that Kate Bolduan, who has been on maternity leave from New Day since September, would be permanently replaced by Alisyn Camerota . 'The manner in which Jeff did it is angering female staffers,' an unnamed insider told Page Six. 'They took [Bolduan] out while she was on maternity leave and buried it on a day when there’s serious news.' The Wrap reported the show was experiencing a ratings boost with Camerota joining co-anchors Chris Cuomo and Michaela Pereira. The gossip site began reporting back in August that CNN had been quietly testing new co-anchors to pair with Cuomo on New Day. Replacement: The morning show was experiencing a ratings boost with Alisyn Camerota joining co-anchors Chris Cuomo and Michaela Pereira . Visitor: Bolduan (second from right) was on set with her new baby girl, Cecilia, back in October while Camerota (left) was still considered a temporary replacement . The morning show had been consistently trailing Fox & Friends, averaging less than half of the Fox News show's ratings in the age 25-54 demographic. The problem was reported to be a lack of chemistry between the co-anchors, with insiders talking of bickering between the three. Still, it was expected that CNN would wait until Bolduan returned from spending time with new baby Cecilia to make any changes. Bolduan will be moving to day-time television after her return on January 26, joining John Berman at 11 a.m. on @ThisHour. CNN has not yet returned a request for comment.","The network announced Friday that Kate Bolduan would be permanently replaced by Alisyn Camerota, who was temporarily filling in .

"A gleaming green comet tore across the United States in its closest encounter with Earth to date. Comet Lovejoy lit up the night's sky on Wednesday, shooting north. It was the final burst for the newly-discovered meteor, which has already been seen rocketing over Europe and Asia. And the astronomer who first spotted the rare wonder said next time it may come even closer. Scroll down for video . Spectacular: Comet Lovejoy is currently whizzing northwards past Earth, leaving an incredible glowing green tail in its wake . 'It is very exciting from the point of view, not just from the point of finding a named object, but from the point of view the time spent developing the comet searching system has paid off,' Lovejoy told CNN. 'There is also excitement around what the comet might do, so there is a couple of days before it is possible to determine the future path of a comet which has a large bearing on how close it will get to us and how bright it might get.' For the past week, the comet has been getting brighter every day making it easier for those in the Northern Hemisphere to spot . Comet Lovejoy, is around 43 million miles from Earth and was thought to be travelling at around 15 miles a second. The comet, also known as C/2014 Q2, was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy, who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers. To date, Mr Lovejoy, from Queensland, has discovered five comets, all using relatively simple equipment compared to what's found at a professional observatory. It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world. Stunning: Views of the comet are expected to be best in around a week's time when it will be visible 'from light-polluted city suburbs' This graph shows how Comet Lovejoy's trajectory is taking it northwards outside our planet's orbit - it will be closest to us on January 7 . Comets are essentially piles of rock, gravel, and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice. As the comet nears the sun, its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight. They also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the Earth's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers. As the graph shows though, the comet's trajectory does not take it inside the Earth's orbit. At its current levels of brightness, Lovejoy can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult. A comet's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale, lower numbers indicate more intense brightness. At its current levels of brightness, Lovejoy can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult . It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks was  dramatically captured on camera by stargazers in Japan, above . Lovejoy started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5, the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope. As National Geographic reports, comet Lovejoy should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-January, which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet 'from light-polluted city suburbs'. Some observers were able to spot Lovejoy in late December as it reached magnitude 5.3. Lovejoy's  striking color is due to two gases emanating from the comet: cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green when sunlight passes through them.

"Jailed: RAF Corporal Scott Cuckoo was sentenced to 28 months behind bars after importing ecstasy tablets to sell online . An RAF corporal who sold ecstasy tablets online that he had imported between his tours of duty in Afghanistan has been jailed. Corporal Scott Cuckoo, who was described as an 'impeccable' serviceman, bought the drugs from the Netherlands before selling them on over the internet. The married 30-year-old faces being dishonourably discharged from the forces after being jailed for 28 months today. The talented serviceman, described as a high-flyer, first began using ecstasy as a means of coping with what happened to him in Afghanistan, Winchester Crown Court was told. Disgraced Cuckoo was rumbled when customs officers intercepted three packages from the Netherlands destined for his home address. They each contained 50 ecstasy tablets and were labelled with the false name 'Mr S Coombes', the court heard. Police called at his flat in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and the helicopter engineer admitted he had invented the alias and the packages were in fact his. Officers searched the property and found a further 139 tablets and 26.43g of the drug in powder form. They had a total street value of £1,600. The home was also filled with packaging materials, which were ready to send out to his customers who had ordered online. They were designed to look like they contained spare parts for machinery. Prosecutor Rebecca Fairbairn said: 'In April this year, a number of packages were intercepted by the UK Border Force, which were destined for Basingstoke. 'Each package was found to contain around 50 ecstasy tablets and were addressed to a 'Mr S Coombes'. 'The only residents of that address were Mr Cuckoo and his wife. On April 23, the police attended the address to speak to Mr Coombes, and Mr Cuckoo answered the door. 'Officers asked him the whereabouts of Mr Coombes and disclosed what their enquiry was about. Helicopter engineer: Corporal Cuckoo had completed eight tours of duty in Afghanistan, Winchester Crown Court heard . 'The defendant made it clear he was involved in the matter and was arrested. A large quantity of ecstasy tablets and powder were found.' Cuckoo has been in the RAF for ten years and worked as an aircraft engineer, fixing helicopters in Afghanistan. Some of the helicopters were used to repatriate dead or injured servicemen, and others on Special Forces missions, the court heard. Cuckoo completed eight tours of Afghanistan and spent seven months there last year alone. But he has now had to rent out his home and move back in with his parents after his drug dealing business brought his career to an abrupt end. Nicholas Rowland, mitigating, said: 'His seniors describe him as a highly skilled and motivated serviceman who performed admirably. Tours of duty: Corporal Cuckoo, a helicopter engineer, has been in the RAF for 10 years and spent seven months in Afghainstan last year alone . 'He was held in high regard in the squadron and his performance at home and abroad has been remarkable. 'His commanding officers say he has an impeccable skill set, and had a high-flying career ahead of him. But he got involved in this incredibly foolish enterprise and he has now lost his career. 'He will be dishonourably discharged and his pension will disappear. His personal life has been devastated by what he's done.' Mr Rowland added: 'Mr Cuckoo started to use ecstasy as a coping mechanism when he returned from Afghanistan. 'From using it as a coping mechanism, he somehow embarked on this project, which he did not need to do for financial reasons. 'He did it to help him cope with depression, which is a rather bizarre reaction to what had happened to him in Afghanistan. 'He saw many things on active service that others could not possibly imagine. Servicemen respond in different ways.' Judge Jane Miller QC said: 'You were quite clearly a very promising young man and this is a fall from grace. 'What possessed you to start importing drugs from abroad and start dealing, I cannot imagine.' Cuckoo fought back tears as he was led from the dock to the cells. He admitted one charge of possession of ecstasy with intent to supply.","Corporal Scott Cuckoo was caught when his drugs package was intercepted .

"Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims . Britain’s first elected Muslim Cabinet minister has said it is ‘lazy’ to claim Islam had nothing to do with last week’s terror attacks in France. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims. Mr Javid also called on British Muslims to do more to tackle extremism – claiming they had a ‘special burden’ because so many of the attacks were carried out by fanatics who claim inspiration from Islam. The former banker, who became the first Muslim Tory MP after being elected in 2010, attacked the ‘barbaric’ terrorists responsible for last week’s atrocities. Mr Javid said: ‘The lazy answer from people out there is to say that this had got nothing whatsoever to do with Islam and Muslims and that should be the end of that part of the debate. ‘That is lazy and that would be wrong. You can’t get away from the fact that these people are using Islam, they are taking a great religion, a peaceful religion of a billion people around the world, taking this religion and using it as their tool to carry out their horrible activities.’ Mr Javid said because of this there was a ‘special burden’ on Muslims to deal with Islamic extremism. He said: ‘All communities can do more to try and help and deal with terrorists, try and help track them down, but I think it is absolutely fair to say that there is a special burden on Muslim communities, because whether we like it or not, these terrorists call themselves Muslims. ‘It is no good for people to say they are not Muslims, that is what they call themselves. They do try to take what is a great peaceful religion and warp it for their own means.’ Mr Javid said that the Government's anti-terror legislation needed to be stronger. He said: ‘Actually, ever since 9/11, and the terrible bus bombings in London, Governments has taken this issue seriously. ‘There have been a number of measures to de-radicalise and prevent radicalisation in the first place, and the question is, does it need to be tougher? I think the answer is yes. Armed French military on the streets at Place De La Nation today - the end point of today's 'unity rally' against extremism . Up to a million people are expected to attend today's march in Paris following last week's terror attacks . The Culture Secretary also rejected the suggestion that Governments should step in on matters involving newspaper articles deemed to be offensive. The former banker said: ‘Most people would accept in our country just as in any free country, we have a balance of laws that are there to protect people but also to protect their right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. That is absolutely vital, that is something we can never let go of. ""When a newspaper decides to do, or a magazine or TV channel for that matter, it is up to them, it has got nothing to do with the Government. It never should have. ‘People can still object to something they don't like in a paper or magazine, but that doesn’t mean to say that it can’t be published. That is freedom, that is how it works. ‘There is no role for government to tell any media organisation what they should or should not publish. It is what makes us such a special society."" Home Secretary Theresa May (second right) was in Paris today alongside the French President Francois Hollande . Mr Javid ducked a question on whether the UK threat level was likely to be raised, saying those decisions were for security professionals. He said: ‘We remain vigilant at all times, naturally and if the threat level changes than that is a decision by the professionals. ‘What we have seen though in recent days as well is through Parliament we have had the counter terrorism bill going through, which I think is a demonstration of even while these acts were unfolding in Paris, we were debating these issues in Parliament and making sure our security forces, our police, have the tools that they need to do the job. ‘I think most people would accept that you need to make sure that the laws that you have, some that you have relied on in the past, are kept up to date, and especially in the face of modern technology.’","Sajid Javid says there is ‘no getting away’ from fact  terrorists were Muslim .

"A British man who rode a motorbike naked through Cambodia will be kicked out of the country tomorrow for 'violating the beautiful customs and culture' of the country. Crawford Brown, 24, a student from the University of the West of Scotland, spent the weekend in jail after being pulled over by police for riding naked. Police also caught 22-year-old Catarina Aarnio, from Finland, and Italian Giancarlo Allocca, 30, travelling naked with Mr Brown. Scroll down for video .

Chuon Chomkol said: 'I can't let foreigners act like this, even if they didn't know the traditions of our country' The trio had reportedly stripped off and rode in the Leuk Daek district, 50 miles south east of Phnom Penh. Officer Chuon Chomkol told the Cambodia Daily: 'We saw them drive in front of our commune police station and I then ordered my officials to follow them and stop them. 'They drove when they had no clothes on. It looked so indecent in public and in our country, so we needed to arrest them.' He added: 'I can't let foreigners act like this, even if they didn't know the traditions of our country.'

'The General Department of Immigration has asked the leadership of the Ministry of Interior to expel them from the country as punishment,' Sok Phal, head of the Ministry of Interior's immigration department, said.

"Raw milk used on skin and body as a cosmetic use could trigger serious health problems, an expert has warned. It comes after the Victorian Government announced tough new laws, forcing dairy farmers to turn raw milk unpalatable or treat it safe for human consumption from January 1. Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. But UNSW's Associate Professor of Food and Microbiology Julian Cox told The Sunday Telegraph that the sale of organic bath milk at selected retail stores was to avoid the ban. Scroll down for video . Raw milk used on skin and body as a cosmetic use could trigger serious health problems, expert has warned . Following the death of a toddler and four other children who fell seriously ill after it's believed they consumed raw milk, Cox said cows could pass on mastitis or 'milk fever' during the milking process. 'In mastitis, bacteria can be present at very high levels in raw milk,' Associate Professor Cox said. 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa is well known to cause problems with wounds and burns, high levels could be a problem even with topical or cosmetic use — without consumption.' Following the regulations, raw milk producers who breach the new rules will be slapped with hefty fines of $17,700 and could lose their license to produce dairy products, the Herald Sun reports. Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs Jane Garrett said the changes will help protect consumers from the serious risks of drinking raw unpasteurised milk. 'Unfortunately we have seen some young children become severely ill through the consumption or raw milk and it has been linked to the tragic death of a young child,' she said. 'The packaging and sale of raw milk as a cosmetic bath product is causing some confusion among consumers. 'Raw milk may be sold for cosmetic use as 'bath' milk and can appear similar to other milk products, but it must carry warning labels.' A three-year-old allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk . Regulators are considering whether raw milk labels mislead consumers, with the product often sold alongside consumable milk products. Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said some people were choosing to drink raw milk because they believed it was healthier than pasteurised milk. The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and its packaging looks similar to that of regular milk. There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier. They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. Dr Rosemary Lester (left) from Victoria's Department of Health has issued a health warning. The raw milk is often sold near pasteurised milk (right) However, Dr Lester warned that raw milk can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea. In addition 'only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said. She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. 'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.'","Raw milk used as a cosmetic use could trigger serious health problems .

"Election plan: David Cameron will today launch the six key themes of his party’s pitch to voters in May . Immigration will not feature at the heart of the Conservative election manifesto even though it is voters’ top concern, it emerged last night. David Cameron will today launch the six key themes of his party’s pitch to the voters in May, saying they will be the deficit, jobs, taxes, education, housing and retirement. But immigration, Europe and the NHS are conspicuous by their absence. This is despite the fact that last month pollsters revealed immigration is now consistently the most important political issue of concern to voters. YouGov said that since May 2014, people have in every month put it above or tied with the economy. The issue of immigration remains sensitive for the Tories, who have failed on deliver on their 2010 pledge to cut net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ every year thanks largely to an influx of workers from the European Union. Net migration is currently running at 260,000, according to official figures published last month. Nigel Farage’s Ukip is still polling about 13 per cent and now has two MPs following the defections of Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless to the Tories. And critics will point out that the absence of the NHS is no coincidence given that it is currently going through an A&E crisis. It remains a core Labour issue and one on which Ed Miliband feels he can still score points. Last night the Conservatives said that although immigration and the NHS are not due to be manifesto themes, it would be wrong to say they are being ‘ignored’. Tackling immigration is a key plank of the party’s long-term economic plan, a source said. Mr Cameron will launch his party’s themes in a speech this morning – concentrating on tackling the deficit. The inclusion of the deficit as his first key theme contrasts with the way Mr Miliband forgot to mention the issue at all in his conference speech last year. The Prime Minister will say that parents must ‘look at the children they love’ and decide whether they should be saddled with the huge debts that he claims a Labour government would entail. Latest polling shows that voters name the economy, health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family, with immigration a key concern for the country . Slip-up: The inclusion of the deficit as his first key theme contrasts with the way Mr Miliband forgot to mention the issue at all in his conference speech last year . He will insist the Britain of the future must live within its means – and will warn that if it does not, the country would be on the ‘road to ruin’. He will warn that a Labour victory could leave the UK with a ‘mountain of debt’ to the next generation that they could ‘never hope to re-pay’. ‘This isn’t just about the straightforward economic arguments,’ he will say. ‘It is about the values of this country – whether we as a nation are going to pass on a mountain of debt to the next generations that they could never hope to repay. ‘I say we have a responsibility to act. We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.’ He will say that dealing with the deficit is crucial to make sure the UK can carry on investing in hospitals, schools and strong public services – and cope with future shocks in the global economy. ‘This means Britain will have to run a surplus so that we start paying down our debts and keep our economy secure, reduce spending and cut out waste instead of increasing taxes on working people, control the welfare budget to save money and reward work, crack down on tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most do, and continue to increase spending on the NHS. ‘With the other parties, all you get is confusion; un-costed plans; the spectre of more debt. Yesterday Chancellor George Osborne (R) claimed Labour was planning a ‘tax bombshell’ equivalent to 3p on income tax or three percentage points on National Insurance . ‘With the Conservatives, you get the opposite: a strong and competent team, a proven record, and a long-term economic plan that is turning our country around.’ Yesterday Chancellor George Osborne claimed Labour was planning a ‘tax bombshell’ equivalent to 3p on income tax or three percentage points on National Insurance. In an interview yesterday, Mr Miliband repeatedly refused to say how much of the savings needed to tackle the deficit would come from cuts to public services and how much would come from tax rises. Mr Osborne claimed that Labour will be forced to put up taxes because it will not match his pledge to deliver the £30billion fiscal consolidation needed to eliminate the deficit through spending cuts and welfare reductions alone. The Chancellor told The Sunday Times any party rejecting his plan to balance the books purely through cuts was ‘either offering the country a tax bombshell or a borrowing bombshell or both’. He has asked Mr Miliband to make clear whether he is planning £15billion worth of tax hikes.","David Cameron will today launch six key themes of party’s pitch to voters .

"Recruits to the armed forces will be asked whether they are gay and about their sexual preferences. The measure has been introduced in a bid to foster greater tolerance within the armed forces, which only allowed gay soldiers to openly serve in 2000. Recruits can, however, choose not to make the declaration. There are no records kept on the number of gay recruits in the force, but the year before the ban was lifted 298 were dismissed. Recruits to the armed forces will be asked whether they are gay and their sexual preferences; pictured above is recruits going through basic training in Winchester, England, in 2005 . James Wharton, 28, who suffered beatings in the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals for being openly gay before being famously saved by Prince Harry, welcomed the move. The ex-Lance Corporal told the Sunday Mirror: ‘It’s fantastic news. But its important troops don’t have to reveal sexual preferences. I wasn’t ready to do that.’ The MoD has previously been forced to make human rights pay outs to gay soldiers. In 2009 they paid just over £124,000 to lesbian soldier, Lance Bombardier Kerry Fletcher, for harassment she suffered which led to her quitting the Royal Artillery. Recruits will also be asked to provide additional information on how open they feel they can be regarding their sexual orientation. The information will not be visible on individual personal records or to chain of command or managers, and will be anonymised before being collated to ensure no one can be identified by their personal diversity information. The Ministry of Defence believes the information will better help them understand the 'composition' of the armed forces and help them ensure their policies and practices 'fully support our personnel'; pictured above, recruits are put through an exercise at the Army Training Regiment near Winchester in 2007 . A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesman said the ministry ‘encourages diversity at all levels’. The spokesman said: ‘Service personnel are now encouraged to declare their sexual orientation. Although this is not mandatory, collecting this data will give us a better understanding of the composition of our armed forces and help ensure our policies and practices fully support our personnel.’ The move to encourage recruits to declare their sexual orientation was introduced last November. The armed forces said they believe the policy will shed new light on their workforce and help create a more inclusive organisation where everyone feels values - no matter their sexuality, race, religion or gender. Stonewall, a charity which campaigned against the discrimination of gay soldiers, welcomed the move saying the more the MoD knows about personnel, the more they ‘can support’ them.","The information will not be visible on individual personal records .

"'Unacceptable': David Davis, the former Tory home affairs spokesman, is leading demands in the Commons for the publication of the Chilcot report . MPs are to demand that the official report into the Iraq war be published in the next few weeks – amid new fears it could be delayed until after the election. The £10million Chilcot inquiry into the disastrous invasion, which led to 100,000 deaths, was set up six years ago by Gordon Brown but its findings have still not been published. A cross-party group of MPs is challenging an alleged ‘stitch- up’ said to be delaying publication of the inquiry’s report. The demand is being led by David Davis, the former Tory home affairs spokesman, who described the failure to publish the document after more than 2,000 days as ‘utterly unacceptable’. ‘Whatever the hold-ups and political wranglings that are delaying publication, the time has come to publish or be damned,’ he said. ‘The suggestion that the report will be delayed until after the election, if it is not ready to be published by the end of February, further damages the inquiry’s credibility and undermines the final report.’ The criticism comes a week after former Tory foreign secretary Lord Hurd said delays in the publication of the report were becoming a ‘scandal’. The Government says the timing of its release is solely the concern of Sir John Chilcot, who led the inquiry and heard evidence in public from more than 120 witnesses. But last week it emerged that if the report is not submitted to ministers before the end of February, the Government would not publish it before the election – claiming that there would not be enough time to debate it fully in Parliament. This argument is being questioned by a cross-party group of MPs including Mr Davis, former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve and former Liberal Democrat home affairs minister Norman Baker. Labour MP Fabian Hamilton and Elfyn Lloyd, the leader of Plaid Cymru’s Westminster representatives, are also part of the group. Mr Lloyd said he did not understand why the Government had imposed the February deadline – saying that as Parliament will not rise until the end of March, there would be plenty of time for a debate. He said he feared that Labour and the Tories – both of whose leaderships supported the 2003 war – had closed ranks to delay the report until after the election. ‘It could be a stitch-up between both benches,’ he said. Guilty conscience? Tony Blair, prime minister at the time of the Iraq invasion in 2003, looks drawn as he stands behind current Labour leader Ed Miliband at the Cenotaph for Remembrance Day last year . Mr Lloyd said he understood that a draft version of the report had been finished almost five months ago. ‘It looks to me as if not enough effort is being made to publish it,’ he said. ‘When things like war arise, you do have a closing-in.’ Mr Baker told the Observer that there were ‘serious questions that needed to be addressed and answered’ before the election. ‘If there are people blocking publication, the British people need to know why,’ he said. Part of the reason for the delay is that those people criticised in the Chilcot report have been given the chance to respond to the criticism before publication. But writing for The Sunday Times, Mr Davis said those facing criticism should not be allowed to hold back publication. He suggested that they be given a deadline of the end of January to give their response. ‘We are no more enlightened as to the failures in the lead-up to, during and after the Iraq War than we were in 2009 when Brown initiated the inquiry,’ he wrote. ‘The perception of politicians and elites colluding to hide the truth from the public is damaging to all parties at a time when politicians are already held in poor regard.’ ‘In any event this is not about personal culpability, of pinning the blame on a small group of individuals, but of collective and systemic failure. It is time to face up to whatever mistakes were made as a nation and consider how best we can avoid them in the future. ‘We cannot allow the sensibilities of our allies, or our current or past politicians, to delay such an important publication any further. ‘Whatever the ramifications, it is time to reveal the truth.’","The £10million  inquiry into Iraq invasion was set up six years ago .

"A nine-year-old schoolboy has been banned from classes because his 'extreme' short back and sides hair style is too long. Billy Eddleston, from Darwen, Lancashire, has been sent home for three days running over his hair, which his headmistress says is too long on the top. Billy, who says plenty of his friends at Hoddlesden St Paul's CE Primary School have the popular hair style, will not be allowed to return to classes until he has had his hair cut again. Billy Eddleston, nine, has been banned from school because the top of his short back and sides hair cut was deemed too long . 'Disgrace': Billy cannot return to Hoddlesden St Paul's CE Primary School until he has had another haircut, but the nine-year-old says his friends have the same hairstyle . His mother Connie Eddleston, 30, a self-employed painter and decorator, has branded the decision a 'disgrace'. She said: 'Billy has had the same haircut, in varying lengths, pretty much his whole life. 'I feel like Billy's been victimised, and he feels picked on. I feel like the school is failing my child. 'It won't stop him learning. If he gets it shorter he'll look like a thug. He's losing out on his education.' Mrs Eddleston first received a letter about Billy's hair before he broke up for Christmas. She admits that she tried to cut her son's hair herself, but she had to take him to the barbers to get it fixed because it was 'a mess'. Hoddlesden St Paul’s CE Primary School's prospectus says its rules on pupils hairstyles are: . 'Shoulder length hair must be tied back. 'We have a no extreme or ‘current trend’ hair policy at our school. 'Plain red headband/headwear for girls and no hair gel for girls or boys.' The mother-of-four said: 'He walked through the [school] doors on Monday and not a word was said. On Tuesday the head collared me and said it was still too long on the top and could I deal with it. 'I took him straight from school to the barbers and had it done. On Wednesday both the head and the deputy head were waiting for us and he was sent home. 'On Thursday and Friday I got him ready for school as normal, made him a packed lunch and put on his uniform and the same thing happened. I can't understand, it's just a short back and sides. 'He has to watch his sisters Isobel, eight, and Olivia, six, walk through the gate in the morning and the head teacher waits for him and tells him he can't come in. It's so trivial. 'I have considered getting his hair cut again, but it's the principle of the thing now. I want them to apologise to my son.' Billy's parents John and Connie Eddleston say the ban is unfair, with Mrs Eddleston branding the school's decision a 'disgrace' Billy, who has now missed three days of school, says he feels like his teachers are 'bullying' him . The school's prospectus states: 'Shoulder length hair must be tied back. We have a no extreme or 'current trend' hair policy at our school. Plain red headband/headwear for girls and no hair gel for girls or boys.' Despite this, Billy has not been allowed to classes and it is still unclear whether he will be able to attend on Monday morning. Billy, who also lives with his father, engineering manager John, 33, and brother Edward, two, said: 'I feel like the school are bullying me. There are other boys with the same hair design and they are allowed to stay.' Mrs Eddleston will meet with headmistress Bernadette Bickerton, as well as the school's governors and an educational welfare officer from  Darwen Council on Wednesday to discuss the matter further. Head teacher Bernadette Bickerton said: 'Billy has not been [permanently] excluded from the school and we hope to see him back in class as soon as possible so any disruption to his education is kept to a minimum. 'Both parents and pupils are made aware of our high expectations and aspirations before they choose the school and we have a very clear uniform policy.' Billy is not the first boy to be admonished for allegedly breaking the rules on hairstyles, but these two boys were punished for their short back and sides not being long enough. Kyle Gibbs was separated from his classmates and told he would not be allowed to socialise with his friends in December after teachers ruled that his short back and sides was not long enough. The Year 9 pupil, 13, at Churchdown Academy, Gloucestershire, had to work on his own in a classroom from 8am until 5pm until his hair reached an 'acceptable length'. His father Colin, from lmbridge, Gloucester, said the school's decision was 'madness' and insisted the young footballer's haircut is 'neat and tidy and totally unremarkable'. Kyle Gibbs, pictured with his father Colin, was made to work on his own because his short back and sides was not long enough . Meanwhile Jack Littlewood, 13, was punished with 'isolation' at his school in Wardley, Greater Manchester, in October, also because his short back and sides cut was deemed to be too short. His furious mother Amanda Brown insisted the youngster has thick hair and wears it short to stop it from becoming unruly. Despite the outrage of his parents, Kyle was told school policy stated that his hair cannot be any shorter than a grade two.

"David Cameron today hit out at the 'complete idiot' TV pundit  who claimed Birmingham was 'totally Muslim' and 'non-Muslims just simply don't go in', . Steve Emerson made the bizarre comments on Fox News in the US - also claiming there were religious police squads roaming the streets of London who 'seriously wound' people in non-Muslim dress. It sparked bafflement on Twitter under the hashtag #FoxNewsFacts, with users suggesting his theory was about as likely as Brummie TV presenter Adrian Chiles  being a radical cleric. Mr Cameron said he thought it must be April Fools' Day, adding: ‘When I heard this, frankly I choked on my porridge. This guy is clearly a complete idiot.' He added: ‘Now, he started with an apology – that’s not a bad place to start. But what he should do is actually look at Birmingham and see what a fantastic example it is of bringing people together of different faiths and different backgrounds and actually building a world class brilliant city.’ Scroll down for video . Grovelling: Terrorism pundit Steve Emerson (left)  apologised after  claiming Birmingham (right) was 'totally Muslim' and 'non-Muslims  don't go in'. He has now pledged a donation to the city's children's hospital . David Cameron said when he heard the comments he 'thought it must be April Fools’ Day', adding: 'I choked on my porridge' In reality, 22 per cent of people from Birmingham are Muslim, according to the 2011 census, fewer than half of the 46 per cent who regard themselves as Christian. Birmingham is the area with the ninth-highest Muslim population in Britain, beaten by four London boroughs alongside Slough, Luton, Bradford and Blackburn. Mr Emerson has now apologised to Birmingham's 1.1million people, insisting the city is 'beautiful' and pledging a donation to the Birmingham Children's Hospital. But he stopped short of offering any sort of apology directly to the city's 234,000 Muslims, who he appeared to lump into the same category as extremists in his rant. The 'expert' has run a group called The Investigative Project on Terrorism for 20 years and written books with titles such as 'Jihad Incorporated' and 'The Terrorists Living Among Us'. Critics have  accused him of inaccuracies and encouraging Islamophobia, yet he is still called upon regularly by news networks and  congressional committees in the U.S. Pundit: Mr Emerson (right) made the claim in an interview with Fox News. He has run a 'project on terrorism' for 20 years and is regularly called on by news outlets, though his critics accuse him of inaccuracies . Slight: In fact, Birmingham has twice as many Christians (46 per cent) as Muslims (22 per cent). Mr Emerson stopped short of apologising to the city's Islamic population, who he appeared to lump in with extremists . His blunder came in a wide-ranging Fox News interview about how to react to the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. 'In Britain, it's not just no-go zones,' he claimed. 'There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don't go in.' As the interviewer's eyes widened in surprise, he added: 'And parts of London, there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire.' Mr Emerson initially seemed happy with the factual accuracy of his performance, posting the entire interview on his website. But once told of his fairly significant error, he apologised. 'I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry,' he told ITV News. Bafflement: In time-honoured fashion, an ironic hashtag about the gaffe was soon circulating on Twitter . 'My comments about Birmingham were totally in error, and I am issuing an apology and correction on my website immediately for having made this comment about the beautiful city of Birmingham. 'I do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that I had relied on other sources because I should have been much more careful. 'I intend to make a donation to a Birmingham charity called the Birmingham Children’s Hospital.' Thousands of Twitter users were suggesting alternative 'Fox News facts' - with a similar level of factual accuracy - within hours of the gaffe. One suggested Cardiff had dispensed with cars and was now known as Diff, while another said all the walls in Cornwall were made from corn. Jokes: Commenters on Twitter said the theory was about as likely as TV presenter Adrian Chiles being a radical cleric, or Mecca bingo halls being a substitute for the holy city of pilgrimage . Because Birmingham was 'totally Muslim' it would have to remove 'ham' from its name, suggested other users. Factual accuracy aside, many defended the city against what they took to be a crude Islamophobic attack. Birmingham City Council Labour member Waseem Zaffar ‏wrote: 'Birmingham is a diverse city with people from 187 countries making it home since 2007'. And school deputy head teacher wrote: 'I live in a multicultural city. I work in a multicultural school. I feel at home. I love it. Birmingham is vibrant because it is diverse.' Mathew Hulbert, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Barwell, Leicestershire, added: 'Birmingham is a beautiful, industrious city at the heart of our nation. Fox News really are beyond a joke!'.","Claim was made on Fox News by terrorism pundit Steve Emerson .

"A bald eagle rescued by a nature photographer from central Illinois has recovered and been returned to the wild, yet the man credited with saving him faces four misdemeanor charges of interfering with wildlife. Steve Patterson has said he came across the two baby eagles and their nest knocked out of a tree in June 2013. One appeared to have been seriously wounded. So, he took them to his home in Oglesby, along the Illinois River, and called the nonprofit Flint Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation, which took them in. The second eagle is still in rehabilitation. Patterson's case has become a rallying point for those pushing for a state law to shield good Samaritans who help injured wildlife, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Free: Sam the eagle was released on New Year's Day. He and fellow eaglet Patty were collected by Steve Patterson after their nest fell out of a tree in June 2013 . Republican State Rep. Bob Pritchard, of Hinckley, has already filed Good Samaritan legislation for the session starting January 14, according to the newspaper. 'It's no different than a domesticated animal or even a human; if you have an injury and you can treat and rehabilitate, we ought to try and do that,' he told the Sun-Times. If convicted of all four misdemeanors, Patterson could spend 12 months behind bars, the newspaper reported. Steve Patterson's earlier trial had a hung jury - and his second, upcoming trial  is scheduled for February 23. Patterson is accused of violating the state's wildlife code by taking the eagle chicks inside his residence, the Sun-Times reported. Good Samaritan? Steve Patterson is accused of violating Illinois' wildlife code by taking two eaglets into his residence back in June 2013Patterson is accused of violating the state's wildlife code by taking the eagle chicks inside his residence, the Sun-Times reported. Patterson contacted the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) - but failed to tell the state agency the birds were inside his garage by the time it returned his call, the newspaper reported. The agency reportedly instructed Patterson to not disturb the eaglets. Patterson contacted Flint Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation before hearing from DNR, according to The Chicago Sun-Times. Dawn Keller, the director of Flint Creek, told the newspaper both eaglets suffered wing fractures. She stated that the male bird, Sam, was released on New Year's Day and and named 'in honor of the good Samaritan law that helped show us there was a dramatic need for.' Keller said Patty will likely be released further down the road. She told The Chicago Sun-Times the female bird was named for Patterson. However, La Salle County State's Attorney Brian Towne has condemned Patterson's actions. Speaking to The Chicago Sun-Times, Towne said 'He did more harm to that eaglet than he did good. Had Patterson not intervened with the experts dealing with the situation, that eaglet would not have had to be released after 18 months of incarceration.' Patterson was convicted in Wisconsin of tampering with wildlife and previously faced off against conservation police, according to Towne. 'I just didn't want to see these two birds die on the ground,' Patterson told the Sun-Times.","Steve Patterson is accused of improperly collecting two eaglets after their nest fell out of a tree .

As part of the NASA team exploring Mars with the Curiosity rover, Behar was responsible for a device that detected hydrogen on the planet's surface as the rover moved. 'His career was dedicated to better understanding Earth and the other planets,' JPL Science Division manager Michael Watkins in a statement. In 2010, he designed a camera that captured a tiny shrimp-like creature swimming deep beneath the Antarctic ice sheet, a highly unexpected find. Colleagues said he was valued for bridging the divide between scientists trying to study an inhospitable environment and engineers whose robots could survive there. As part of the NASA team exploring Mars with the Curiosity rover, Behar was responsible for a device that detected hydrogen on the planet's surface as the rover moved . 'From his submarines that peeked under Antarctica to his boats that raced Greenland's rivers, Alberto's work enabled measurements of things we'd never known,' NASA scientist Thomas Wagner said in a statement. 'His creativity knew few bounds. He is, and will forever be, sorely missed.' The cause of the crash remains under investigation.","Alberto Behar, 47, of Scottsdale, Arizona, died instantly when his single-engine plane nosedived shortly after takeoff Friday from Van Nuys Airport .

"A rare half-male, half-female butterfly has been discovered by staff at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. Now deceased, the unique creature was spotted upon emerging from its cocoon at the institution. Telltale signs are the wings, with the left wing containing a pattern typical of the male and the right displaying markings typical of a female. The lexias pardalis butterfly is a species that has strong sexual dimorphism - with female displaying brown wings with yellow spots and males show off with simmering black and blue wings.

Telltale signs are the wings, with the left wing containing a pattern typical of the male and the right displaying markings typical of a female . The body of the Drexel specimen is also split between male and female parts, a condition known as bilateral gynandromorphy, reports WPTV. Drexel's Academy of Natural Sciences will display the butterfly to the public beginning Jan. 17. While such insects are rare its difficult to tell just how rare they are as in most species the sexes look similar. Fifty-fifty: This is a female lexias pardalis butterfly, which shows yellow spots against brown wings . The male lexias pardalis butterfly is iridescent black and blue . This is a different condition than hermaphroditism, as that would show the outward characteristics of only a single gender. 'Gynandromorphism is most frequently noticed in bird and butterfly species where the two sexes have very different coloration. It can result from non-disjunction of sex chromosomes, an error that sometimes occurs during the division of chromosomes at a very early stage of development,' one researcher told reporters.","Telltale signs are the wings, with the left wing containing a pattern typical of the male and the right displaying markings typical of a female .

"Attack: A neighbour of killer Cherif Kouachi (above) said he headbutted him for listening to pop music . Charlie Hebdo gunman Cherif Kouachi once headbutted his neighbour for listening to 'infidels' music'. The extremist's violent past was laid bare by the man who said he was attacked by the 32-year-old and later threatened when he tried to press charges against him. The neighbour, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said Kouachi would often knock on his door and complain that he was listening to pop music, which he said was 'haram' or sinful. The younger of the Kouachi brothers lived above the man in a seven-storey block of flats in Gennevilliers, a suburb in the north of Paris, for about seven years. Kouachi, 32, rented the 300 Euro-a-month flat with his wife Izzana Hamyd, who was today released from custody. Kouachi, who was shot down in a hail of bullets on Friday, banged on the man's door two years ago and said: 'Don't listen to such music anymore. This is the music of the infidels.' The neighbour said Kouachi, who only listened to Islamic music and prayers, later confronted him in the street and threatened him, saying: 'Haven't you understood yet? You're still listening to infidels' music, you need to stop.' The neighbour said: 'I answered, saying: 'I'm paying my rent, I have the right to listen to whatever I want.' 'And then suddenly he headbutted me really hard. I told him: 'You should be ashamed, you're a Muslim and you're religion tells you to respect others and to not be violent.' Scroll down for video . The killer lived in the same block of flats as the neighbour in the Paris suburb of Gennevilliers (file photo) He reported Kouachi to the police but was deterred from pressing charges after he received another late-night visit from him. The neighbour said: 'When Kouachi found out that I'd reported him to the police he came back to tell me that if I went further with my complaint then I would hear from him. 'He told me: ""I'm not alone. We will come for you."" Later another neighbour told the man that Kouachi had made plans to beat him up again. Mrs Kouachi had confided in the woman saying that she had tried to prevent her husband from attacking him again. Tributes: A growing mass of candles and flowers today outside Charlie Hebdo's offices in Paris . Cherif Kouachi and his brother Said were gunned down in a stand-off with police on Friday after a two-day manhunt and siege. The extremists sparked global condemnation when they burst into the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and slaughtered 12 people, including a police officer outside the building. Cherif, the younger of the two, was radicalised in his years living in the impoverished Parisian enclave of Gennevilliers with his wife. With vast concrete blocks of state-owned flats and a population of around 10,000 Muslims, the vast majority of them from North Africa, the area has a history of tension with the French authorities. Mohammed Benali, the president of Cherif Kouachi's local mosque, said the problem was not with those who had immediately come to France. Solidarity: More than a million people paid their respects to the victims on the streets of Paris today . Instead it was those whose families had been there for several decades, but whom the authorities had made little attempt to integrate into wider society. Mr Benali told the Daily Mail last week: ‘They saw how their parents were treated and felt deeply resentful. 'After the 2005 riots I was among a Muslim delegation who met Nicolas Sarkozy (then interior minister) and I’ll never forget his words. ‘He told me that “to humiliate is to radicalise” – and that is exactly what came to pass. 'This second generation felt excluded, discriminated against, and most of all, humiliated. 'Added to which, they were deeply mixed up – they spoke and felt French, but were regarded as Arabic; they were culturally confused.’","Incident told by a former neighbour in Paris suburb of Gennevilliers .

"A mother who left her 12-year-old son in the care of a family friend when she went on a trip to Spain was dragged to court accused of child neglect and cruelty. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was eventually cleared by a Crown Court judge but said the episode had torn her family apart and left her battling depression. The boy, now 14, was taken away from his family and was allowed to see his mother only under supervision seven times in the 11 months before the trial. Now he has decided to remain living with a relative 300 miles away after starting his GCSE studies and settling in to a new school. The mother of a 12-year-old boy left home alone while she holidayed in Spain has had the case against her dropped but her son still doesn't want to live with her; she is pictured above with her husband, the boy's step father - neither of them can be identified . MPs have criticised the decision to prosecute the mother and have called on the Government to issue specific guidance on leaving children home alone. Currently the law fails to explain at what age or for how long a child can be left on their own. But parents face prosecution if they are deemed to have put a child at risk by leaving them unsupervised. The family’s saga began two years ago when the youngster declined to join his mother and stepfather on a trip to sort out some issues with a holiday home they own in Andalucia. Instead they arranged for the ‘independent, intelligent young man’ to be cared for by a ‘long-standing family friend’. The couple are now seeking compensation and an apology from social services over the case . However, the couple discovered that the boy had spent two nights alone, while he had told his teachers that he did not know who was meant to be looking after him. While they were away, the couple, one a teacher, the other a former social worker, received a phone call from police saying they would be questioned under caution over child neglect on their return. The parents rushed home but they were arrested and the boy was sent to live with a relative by the authorities. The law does not give an age when children can be left alone. But parents can be prosecuted under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 for wilful neglect if they leave a child unsupervised ‘in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health’ – a definition which police and social services are left to interpret. Punishment can range from a fine to ten years’ imprisonment. When the case was finally heard at Carlisle Crown Court, Judge Paul Batty directed the jury to return not-guilty verdicts. He said the man tasked with looking after the boy had given inconsistent evidence and that in other circumstances there was no suggestion the couple had been anything other than excellent parents. The mother told The Sunday Times: ‘I will have to live the rest of my life with this. There’s depression. It was so unnecessary and cruel ... One of the hardest things is seeing the children getting off the school bus every afternoon and my son not being among them.’ The boy is still in regular contact with his mother by phone and email but sees her only in the school holidays. Lib Dem MP John Hemming has tabled a parliamentary question asking the Government to issue guidance on when children can be left on their own and for how long. He said: ‘In this case the parents had done everything to make sure their child was looked after, so why did it take two years to work out they hadn’t done anything wrong?’ The Department for Education said: ‘The law is clear that parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health.’","The parents made arrangements with a neighbour to care for their son .

"Rev Al Sharpton has admitted to taking sex pill Viagra after police found a prescription with his name on it in the apartment of Sanford Rubenstein, the New York lawyer who was recently cleared of rape charges. Baptist minister Sharpton, 60, who has been married twice, confessed about the drug while speaking Saturday at the National Action Network in Harlem, The New York Daily News reported. 'They called asking about some pill,' Sharpton told his congregation of supporters. 'I said ''Yep, I took Excedrin, too! You got any other dumb questions?''' Excedrin is an over-the-counter drug for headache relief. The comments appear to be a way for Sharpton to overcome the Viagra controversy, which came to light earlier this week. 'Yep, I took it': Rev Al Sharpton admitted to taking sex pill Viagra at the National Action Network in Harlem Saturday (pictured) after police found a prescription with his name on it in the apartment of Sanford Rubenstein, the New York lawyer who was cleared of rape charges earlier this week . Moving on: Sharpton had earlier accused police of trying to embarrass him by leaking details of the prescription to the press after the Rubenstein case had closed . It was leaked that a Viagra prescription was found in Rubenstein's home after he was cleared of rape charges . On Monday, Rubenstein, 70, a high-profile civil rights attorney and friend of Sharpton's, was cleared of any rape charges following a three-month investigation. A 42-year-old woman had accused him of raping her last year. But rather than the case disappearing from the media spotlight, it was leaked that a prescription for Viagra – a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction – was found in Rubenstein’s apartment, made out in Sharpton’s name. Sharpton then hit out at police, claiming that they were trying to humiliate him. He said 'if the motive of the cop was to embarrass me, at 60-years-old, I am unembarrassable',The Daily News reported. He added: ‘I am not saying what I do or don’t do, I’m not going to invade my privacy for some cop. I have no knowledge of what was in (Rubenstein’s) apartment. But it’s not uncommon for men of all ages to use certain things.’ A 42-year-old executive from the National Action Network claimed Rubenstein attacked her in his New York penthouse apartment following Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party in October. The woman said she was drugged with cookies laced with marijuana before she was raped. But the Manhattan district attorney's office have said Rubenstein's case will not be sent to the Grand Jury following a three-month investigation because of a lack of compelling evidence. The 70-year-old was set to represent the family of Eric Garner after he died in a chokehold at the hands of police officers in Staten Island in July. However he removed himself from the case when the allegations surfaced. Rubenstein told the New York Daily News he was 'very pleased' with the decision and excited to get back to work. In a statement he said: 'I maintained from the very beginning that I did not violate the law. I am pleased that the system worked and that I have now been fully cleared.' 'I look forward to many more years of practicing law and representing victims.' In the clear: Sanford Rubenstein, a top civil rights lawyer, has been told he will not face charges after a woman accused him of raping her in his New York apartment last October . Allegations: Rubenstein maintained the encounter following Sharpton's 60th birthday was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams . Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, released a statement Monday saying: 'Over the past three months, the District Attorney's Sex Crimes Unit has conducted a thorough investigation into the incident that occurred on October 2 and was reported to authorities approximately 36 hours later. 'In keeping with standard procedure, prosecutors and investigators with decades of experience in such matters reviewed all aspects of the incident, including video surveillance, physical evidence, and medical records, and conducted extensive witness and expert interviews. 'The video evidence in this case included surveillance footage from before and after the incident, taken from the lobby and elevator of the suspect's apartment building, as well as from earlier in the evening at the Four Seasons restaurant. 'The investigation also included the collection and testing of multiple items of physical evidence, many pursuant to a search warrant executed at the suspect's apartment, as well as electronic devices and telephone records. 'A review of medical records was conducted by an independent medical expert. Experts at the National Institutes of Health and the FBI were also consulted. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner conducted toxicology and forensic testing, and further testing was performed at a second independent laboratory. Investigation: NYPD officers were seen taking 'biological evidence' away from Rubenstein's luxury penthouse in brown bags after the allegations surfaced last November. They included a mattress, bedding and a sex toy .","Rev Al Sharpton made the admission Saturday at a New York meet .

"It is known for undercutting its rivals with food at bargain prices. But despite being a discount supermarket, it seems Aldi’s graduate employees don’t come cheap. The chain is apparently paying bright students starting salaries of up to £42,000 to train as managers. According to research out today, the average starting wage for university leavers at Britain’s 100 leading employers will exceed £30,000 for the first time ever this year – with Aldi’s being the most generous declared wage outside of the City. Scroll down for video . Discount chain Aldi is apparently paying students starting salaries of up to £42,000 to train as managers . Almost a third of graduate jobs at these firms now pay more than £35,000, with four well-known investment banks offering basic salaries of between £45,000 and £50,000. The figures come amid the best prospects for student job-hunters in a decade. The first generation of students to pay £9,000-a-year tuition fees will graduate into a ‘buoyant’ job market this summer, with the most opportunities since 2005. However, leading employers were forced to leave 700 graduate jobs unfilled last year, as some struggled with a ‘lack of quality applications’. The figures, from the 10th annual Graduate Market study, also found that students with no work experience stand little chance of landing a job at nearly half of the top 100 employers. Almost a third of vacancies at these firms will be filled by graduates who have already done work experience or internships with them – rising to three quarters at City investment banks. The study, compiled by analysts High Fliers Research, revealed the vacancies and starting salaries at 100 of the country’s biggest graduate employers, including Goldman Sachs, the BBC, Google and MI5. Students gaining their degree this year will start work on a typical salary of £30,000, up from £29,500 last year. However, the study said it was unlikely that starting salaries have been raised in response to the rise in tuition fees – but rather to compete with rival companies. It found that they recruited 7.9 per cent more graduates last year and are likely to expand by another 8.1 per cent this year. The report noted: ‘This substantial increase in graduate vacancies for 2015 takes graduate recruitment beyond the pre-recession peak in the graduate market in 2007, and means that there will be more opportunities for this summer’s university leavers than at any time in the last decade.’ The research also revealed the universities where bosses are most likely to concentrate their talent-spotting efforts. Manchester was targeted by the most employers, with Nottingham, Warwick, Cambridge and Oxford making up the top five.","Average starting wage for university leavers at Britain’s 100 leading employers will exceed £30,000 for the first time ever this year .

"Murdered: Teenager Stephen Lawrence was killed in 1993 . The remarkable legacy of hope created in Stephen Lawrence’s name breaks new ground today with the launch of journalism scholarships sponsored by the Daily Mail. The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, founded by the murdered teenager’s mother in 1998, already has a track record of helping disadvantaged students into careers in architecture – the profession which A-level student Stephen dreamed of entering. As part of an initiative to expand its work into other professions, the trust has now joined the Mail to offer two aspiring journalists the chance to learn the trade on our renowned training course. Stephen’s mother Doreen Lawrence, now Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon, said: ‘I am delighted to announce the Stephen Lawrence trainee reporter scholarship in partnership with the Daily Mail. ‘The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust’s mission is to transform the career opportunities of aspiring, talented young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. ‘This rare opportunity to train in journalism via the highly sought-after “best course in the business” – on the Daily Mail – is an excellent example of how we demonstrate Stephen’s legacy.’ Baroness Lawrence said the trust’s aims and ethos are ‘watering the seeds of ambition’. Those from lower income households, or who attend or attended a non-fee paying school or are the first generation of their immediate family to attend university, are strongly encouraged to apply for the 14-month journalism course. The successful applicants will be paid a competitive salary while they train. The course starts at the end of August, leading to consideration for a full-time post after completion. Details of the scholarships are being sent to inner city schools, academies and universities. Stephen was stabbed to death at the age of 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993. The Mail campaigned to bring the killers to justice and published a landmark front page accusing five men of the murder. In February 1997, under the headline MURDERERS, we printed pictures of each of the suspects after they arrogantly refused to answer the most basic of questions at an inquest into Stephen’s death. The subsequent Macpherson Inquiry into the killing accused the Met of being ‘institutionally racist’. Two of the men named – Gary Dobson and David Norris – were eventually convicted of murder in 2012. Paul Dacre, Editor of the Daily Mail, said: ‘We share with Stephen’s family the wish that more hardworking students from disadvantaged backgrounds should also look to journalism as a career – just as Stephen aspired to become an architect before his life was so viciously cut short. 'We are delighted that we have been able to provide a substantial investment for these bursaries and bring them into our training scheme.’ Since it was founded, the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust has awarded more than 100 architecture bursaries, with many students going on to qualify as architects. d.wilkes@dailymail.co.uk .

"A shift in strategy during the Sydney Lindt cafe siege has reportedly caused tension among police as some officers believe a late decision to change tactics put hostages in greater danger. Police who were on the front line of the siege in Martin Place on December 15 are understood to be angry about the command strategy put in place when they stormed the cafe after a 16-hour stand-off with gunman Man Horan Monis, Fairfax Media reports. It follows revelations hostage Katrina Dawson was shot by a police bullet during the dramatic shootout. Cafe owner Tori Johnson was executed by the gunman. Scroll down for video . Police who were on the front line of the Sydney Lindt cafe siege on December 15 are understood to be angry about the command strategy put in place when they stormed the cafe after a 16-hour standoff . Police had drawn up a direct action plan as the siege stretched into the night, which would see them storm the cafe and take the gunman by surprise instead of waiting for him to act. While police had considered implementing this direct action plan, which is high risk and likely to result in some casualties, the strategy was overruled when the gunman fired his first shot at 2.03am after six hostages escaped. Police instead opted for a reactive emergency action strategy after the gunman shot dead cafe manager Mr Johnson forcing them to storm the cafe in a hail of gunfire. Some of the hostages of the Sydney siege were able to escape the Lindt cafe before the shoot out took place . Police investigations reveal Katrina Dawson (left) was hit by a bullet fired by police as they stormed the Lindt cafe after Man Haron Monis executed manager Tori Johnson (right) just after 2am . Among the shots fired by police, two ricocheted and killed Ms Dawson, a 37-year-old mother of three, according to Fairfax Media. There is reportedly now tension among some officers who are angry the direct action strategy did not go ahead. The direct action plan, which is normally a last resort, was reportedly ready several hours before police stormed the cafe. Police have to assess all the intelligence they have and weigh up the risks of implementing a direct action strategy. After six hostages escaped at 2.03am, police would have had to speak with the victims to find out the latest details from inside the cafe, . NSW Police would not comment. It is conducting an independent investigation into the incident. Police had drawn up a direct action plan as the siege stretched into the night, which would see them storm the cafe and take the gunman by surprise instead of waiting for him to act . While police had considered implementing this direct action plan, which is high risk and likely to result in some casualties, the strategy was overruled when the gunman fired his first shot . It emerged at the weekend that Ms Dawson was struck by a police bullet as a police investigation also revealed the gunman had enough ammunition to kill all of the hostages, news.com.au reports. Ms Dawson, 38, was not directly hit by a bullet but possibly a ricochet when officers raided the cafe. From initial lines of inquiry, it is believed Ms Dawson was struck in the heart by a ricocheting bullet while on the floor and again in her shoulder. The siege's second victim, Tori Johnson, was shot in the head from behind - at close range - by Monis before officers raided the cafe. The circumstances surrounding the 16-hour Martin Place siege is still the subject of a critical incident investigation by the homicide squad. Ms Dawson's cause of death will be determined by the NSW Coroner once that investigation is completed. Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson were both held hostage by Man Haron Monis at Sydney's Lindt cafe . Hostages were forced to hold Islamic flags in the windows of the cafe for hours on end . Police also would not confirm if bullets had been found in Monis' pocket following the end of the siege. The details of the final moments of the Sydney siege emerge days after it was revealed the gunman  was dropped from the national watch lists on the same year he was reported to federal police for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal. As more information comes to light about Monis’ violent and disturbing past, people continue to question why the man with a history of threatening behaviour was not being more closely monitored by authorities. It is alleged Monis repeatedly made threats to the principal of a South Sydney school, accusing him of being a traitor and a 'sell-out' for allowing the school to engage in interfaith activities, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Police instead opted for a reactive emergency action strategy after the gunman shot dead cafe manager Mr Johnson forcing them to storm the cafe in a hail of gunfire . There is reportedly now tension among some officers who are angry the direct action strategy did not go ahead . After sending about 12 abusive faxes, ranting about the school’s choice to associate with a Jewish school and for holding an inter-faith Anzac Day ceremony, Monis' messages became more sinister. 'People like you will get what's coming your way,' he wrote to Osman Karolia, who was the then-principal of Arkana College in Kingsgrove. Mr Karolia became concerned and asked if that was intended as a threat, to which Monis replied ‘yes’. Mr Karolia contacted Australian Federal Police, deeply concerned Monis was acting in a hostile manner towards himself and the school. Although Monis was investigated, police still elected to stop monitoring Monis by removing him from watch lists that same year.","Strategy shift during Sydney Lindt cafe siege caused tension among police .

"The UK's most senior police officer has said a terror attack in Britain is unlikely despite reports that the country is on the brink of raising the threat level to its highest in seven years. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said an attack was possible but called for the public to remain calm in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. He told Sky News: 'I don't think it's likely but I think we all know it's a possibility - the threat level is severe and so therefore that means a terrorist attack is possible. Scroll down for video . Claim: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said an attack was possible but unlikely . 'We do our best together with the security services to make sure the terrorists don't succeed and that we keep people safe. To date, that's broadly what we've been able to achieve.' Britain's threat level was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe' in August last year following the gains made by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The Sunday Times today quoted senior security sources who warned that Britain is poised to raise the terrorist threat level to 'critical' - the highest category. A 'critical' threat level means that a terrorist attack is expected imminently, while with 'severe' it is highly likely and 'moderate' means an attack is possible but unlikely. Armed police swarm the entrances and exits to the Hyper Cache in eastern Paris after several shoppers were held hostage for several hours during this week's terrorist aassault spanning over three days in Paris . Police officers protect themselves with riot shields as a fiery blast explodes at the entrance to the supermarket in Porte de Vincennes on Friday . The last time it was at 'critical' was in June 2007 following failed terrorist attacks at Glasgow airport and in London. Claims that the threat level may be raised again come amid fears that Islamist militants are planning a terrorist 'spectacular' in the West. Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, said on Friday that a group of core al Qaida terrorists in Syria is planning 'mass casualty attacks' against Western targets. He also stated that a terror attack in Britain is 'highly likely'.

By March last year, almost 4,000 people, 1,450 children among them, had been referred for possible inclusion to the programme, an increase of 70 per cent since 2013, The Telegraph reports. A total of 777 people considered at risk of terrorism had been introduced to Channel since it was founded, and the service is managing 'at least 300' active cases, according to providers. These include young people who have been intercepted at airports attempting to fly to Syria, others whose siblings or friends have travelled to the country, people radicalised in prison and even schoolchildren.","Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says attack is possible .

Government spokesman Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska said . officials would only comment after the recording is published in full. Wprost has only provided a transcript of excerpts of the conversation, which it said was recorded in the spring. The magazine has said the sound files will be published today or tomorrow. While the alleged Sikorski comments do not reveal any illegal actions, if confirmed, they would likely put Poland's top diplomat on the defensive. The prime minister's office said Tusk was likely to address the issue Monday. Diplomatic storm: It is the latest recorded revelation from magazine Wprost to rattle Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government . Wprost already last week set off a . political storm with the release of a recording of a conversation . between central bank head Marek Belka and Interior Minister Bartlomiej . Sienkiewicz. In the recording, the two discussed how the bank could help . the governing party win re-election in 2015, an apparent violation of . the bank's independence. Critics responded by calling on Tusk's . government to resign. Sikorski has been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and has strongly criticized Russian actions in neighboring Ukraine this year. In the past he was a strong supporter of the United States. But he has become more critical of Washington in recent years, especially after President Barack Obama's attempted 'reset' of ties with Russia in 2009 and the subsequent scaling-down of the U.S. missile defense plan for Poland and other parts of eastern Europe. Amid recent violence in Ukraine, Sikorski has been calling for a substantial U.S. troop presence on Polish soil. He has also been widely mentioned as a possible successor to Catherine Ashton as the EU's foreign policy chief. Poland officially put him forward as a candidate last month. 'The publishing of the tapes poses a threat to the social and political order of the state,"" sociologist Henryk Domanski said on TVN24 news channel. ""This will have repercussions for Sikorski and for his international career, but on the other hand, Sikorski is known in the world for his strong, extreme statements.' Wprost has not revealed the source of the recordings, other than to say that they were obtained from a businessman who did not make them. In Poland, secretly recording a conversation is a crime. Some Poles wonder whether Russia might have a hand in the revelations, on the argument that the Kremlin benefits from a destabilized Poland. While the source of the recording remains unclear, political analyst Rafal Chwedoruk said he believed that the case was about political fighting and 'internal games' — with international implications. 'But if indeed foreign intelligence was involved, that involvement would be so deeply hidden that we would not be able to track it down for years,' he told The Associated Press. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Radek Sikorski said to have made remarks during a private conversation .

"Some of the biggest names in music, sport and theatre are demanding the Government cracks down on 'unscrupulous practices' among websites reselling tickets - often at huge mark-ups. The managers of One Direction - The Agency Group -  and rock stars Nick Mason of Pink Floyd and Radiohead's Ed O'Brien, are among those calling for a change in the law to stop secondary ticket sellers over-charging customers. The National Theatre, the Lawn Tennis Association which hosts Wimbledon, and the Rugby Football Union have also added their names to an open letter calling for changes. Some of the biggest names in music - including One Direction - sport and theatre are demanding the Government cracks down on 'unscrupulous practices' among websites reselling tickets - often at huge mark-ups; the House of Commons are set to vote on a consumer right change to address the issue . The letter was published in the Independent on Sunday. Their public stand comes ahead of a key vote in the House of Commons tomorrow at which ministers will reportedly try to block a clause in the Consumer Rights Bill which would force sites reselling tickets to state its original face value. The letter states: 'As representative from the live-event industry, responsible for putting on shows ranging from international sporting fixtures and world-class theatre to intimate gigs, we are committed to ensuing that event-goers have the best experience possible at a fair price. 'The way the secondary-ticketing market is allowed to operate at present can seriously undermine that effort.' Campaigners claim some promoters are funnelling sought-after tickets onto secondary ticket websites which sell them at excessive prices. Nick Mason from Pink Floyd, left, and Ed O'Brien from Radiohead, have added their names to the campaign . They accused the Government of 'sticking up for' these websites and urged it to 'put fans first' instead. They also pointed to a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary, The Great Ticket Scandal, which 'exposed how secondary platforms court major ticket touts and take allocations directly from promoters to sell on above face value to customers'. The campaigners say change is long-overdue after a Metropolitan Police probe - Operation Podium - published a report in 2013 calling for legislation to tackle 'unscrupulous practices, alack of transparency and fraud' within the secondary market. A proposed amendment to the Consumer Rights Bill would force secondary sellers to tell customers how much the ticket initially went for, who they are buying it from, and whether it is being sold in contravention of its terms and conditions. The campaigners letter accused the Government of trying to 'strip' the clause out of the Bill and urged MPs to keep it in. A spokesman for the ticket resale website Viagogo said it was in favour of making information clearer on its website. However it opposed publishing the original seller’s identity or seat numbers, which would allow promoters to cancel tickets that were being resold - which, it said, was 'not in the consumer’s best interests'.","House of Commons are set to vote on law change over tickets prices .

"Disney have developed a new, wheeled robot that can create enormous drawings in the sand. The robot — called the Beachbot — works by dragging a set of pins through the sand, like a rake. Each pin is individually raisable, allowing the contraption to draw lines of varying thicknesses. A 'canvas' is created by setting down poles, which the robot uses as markers to calculate its position. Images are designed on an iPhone or tablet app which can then transmit the data to the machine. It then takes around 10 minutes to create the artwork. Disney have developed a wheeled robot called the Beachbot that can create enormous drawings in the sand .

"Kim Kardashian planted herself firmly on the fashion map with her second Vogue cover this week. Sashaying along a beach with her  trademark long dark tresses and smouldering stare, Kim was also rocking another signature look - an all-white outfit. The 34-year-old loves the cleanest of colours and whether it's a plunging gown, power suit or that famous post-baby selfie, there's only one colour Kim will choose. Scroll down for video . 'My February cover with Australian Vogue': Kim Kardashian  tweeted her  first solo Vogue cover this weekend . Kim wore a full white suit complete with  shoes while in Prague last May, and a pristine dress in 2012 . Kim rocked a white swimsuit in her famous 'belfie' shot after she had lost her baby weight from having North . She's rocked backless white frocks, high necked white dresses and even white swimsuits. But what is the inspiration behind her pure new look? Her rapper husband has taken a strong interest in his now-wife's look and since the pair became an item in 2012 has been open about her direction of her fashion choices. Kim's look is certainly sleeker and more stylish. Gone are the tight, brightly coloured frocks  and in their place are neutral tones and sharp tailoring. And this certainly seems to be influenced by her rapper husband as  Kanye is said to be a fan of this more paired-back look. It was even once reported that he would only allow baby daughter North to dress in neutral colours, with typical baby pink off the menu. Kim choose to wear white dresses for a personal appearance in 2012 (left) and for her birthday in 2014 (right) Kim rocked a white halterneck dress in November 2014, left, and wore a plunging number in Paris with Kanye . Even heavily pregnant in May 2013 Kim chose her favourite colour, accessorising with  perspex shoes . Kim is happy to admit that when it comes to fashion he is a big influence. She once said: 'Kanye and I always talk about my yellow jacket moment. 'There was this one time in Miami when I wore this yellow suede jacket and it was like tighter here and the sleeves got big, it was cropped. 'It was an over-sized jacket, it would have looked really cute on someone who was tall. It wasn't for my body type. We always say, 'This can't be a yellow jacket moment!' Kim is famed for wearing high waisted skirts and crop tops and has even worn them in white . Whilst out and about in LA Kim wore this all-white ensemble with a high waisted skirt and sleek tucked in top . Kim rocked this snakeskin white look in 2012, again matching her look with a pair of black heels . And she recently tweeted that the couple had been, 'up all night,' redoing her wardrobe promising a 'new 2015 vision'. It's not the first time either. In 2012 he was seen going through he closet on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, getting rid of hundreds of items. Furthermore Kim previously revealed that when it comes to fashion the most important thing to her is making sure Kanye likes her outfit. Kim is a fan of tailored white suits wearing a sculptural jacket with Kanye in Paris in 2014 (left) and this crushed white suit with flared skirt and rose gold coloured studded shoes in 2012 (right) Kim rocked this daring wool skirt at the end of last year along with a white crop top and black sandals . Kim wore this white swimsuit with gold detail on the beach in 2012 with a matching floating cover up . She said: 'You want your guy to think you're really hot. I'll put something on and he'll [Kanye] say, 'No, that doesn't look good', and I'll trust him.' Kim also revealed that after having North she was even more compelled to wear paler coloured clothing: 'I want to dress a little lighter colourwise. 'I think North looks cute in light colours, and then I want to wear light colours. North doesn't typically wear pink, though. 'She wears mauve or blush, not, like, typical baby pink.'

"It is one of the downsides of the technological age...the premature wrinkling around the neck suffered by those who constantly look down at their smartphones and tablets. But beauty experts have come up with the answer to combat the sagging skin and creases of so-called 'Tech Neck' – a £65 cream. YSL Beaute has created two products that use a special molecule to combat the loss of elasticity in the skin around the body's Y-Zone – the lower face, throat and decolletage. YSL Beate's Forever Youth Liberator Y.shape cream, left, and the concentrate product, right, which claim to combat sagging skin caused by looking down at smartphones and tablets . It claims its Forever Youth Liberator Y.Shape cream impregnates the skin with millions of micro-droplets, creating a cushion that smooths and plumps the skin. Tech Neck wrinkles are most often found in those aged 18 to 39 who have an average of three digital devices and peer at their screens up to 150 times a day, say experts. But this speeds up the loss of elasticity that would normally occur at middle age, while a constant downward gaze adds further lines and creases around the chin and neck. The two products that use a special molecule to combat the loss of elasticity in the skin around the body's Y-Zone – the lower face, throat and decolletage . Meanwhile, the company's Y.shape 'concentrate' product apparently restores the skin's elasticity to lift the area, re-plump the skin and boost lost volume. YSL claims one single application of the £65 product increases skin elasticity by nearly a third and skin firmness by 13 per cent. Dr Christopher Rowland Payne, consultant dermatologist at The London Clinic, said 'The problem of wrinkles and sagging of the jowls and neck used to begin in late middle age. Tech Neck wrinkles are most often found in those aged 18 to 39 who have an average of three digital devices and peer at their screens up to 150 times a day, say experts (pic posed by models) 'But in the last ten years, because of 'Tech Neck', it has become a problem for a generation of younger women. 'Neck skin is exposed to sun every day because of low necklines, especially in women, but people are less inclined to think of protecting their necks than their faces. 'If they do, they often apply insufficient cream on their necks to avoid getting it on their clothes.' Meanwhile Dr Thierry Michaud, dermatologist and member of the YSL Skin Science team, added: 'Many women I treat accept their wrinkles and fine lines but what they cannot accept is their new facial expressions. 'Inappropriate expressions are due to a loss of facial volumes - sagging skin, less defined contours, creased neck. 'Restoring the facial dynamic is respecting and correcting the emotional language for open features and a fresher look.'","YSL Beaute has created two products claiming to combat 'Tech Neck'

'It took a bit of guts to get in there and have a crack at it,' Mr James told Weekend Sunrise. 'My girlfriend's right into her footage, I thought I'd get this for her and she'll be happy.' But Mr James was not the only one curious about the whale and the sharks. One resident had come down to the beach with his daughter to check out all the action. The man's child barred him from taking a dip but it did not stop them from spectating along with tens of others. A local Broulee resident and his daughter were some of the crowd that gathered to watch the sharks feeding . 'The shark would come and chomp on the whale, swim away 20 minutes later roughly and come back and chomp on it again go digest it, come back. It was quite amazing,' he said. Shark experts closed off the beach until the sharks had dispersed. They said it was common for sharks to feed off a carcass as they were known as the 'garbage cleaners of the sea'. After first circling around, the sharks dive down to bite off pieces of the dead whale .","Michael James waded into the water at Broulee on the NSW south coast .

"Standing outside in rain is probably not most people’s idea of fun. But for one young toddler, it proved to be a fascinating experience. A father filmed his son splashing around in a puddle for the first time, perfectly capturing the child’s excitement as he jumps around in the water. The moment followed a storm outside their home in north California in December. The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube, shows the young boy struggling to maintain his balance as he spins around in the puddle. The child’s father said: ‘After weeks of rain in Northern California December 2014. My son was going stir crazy, he needed to go outside. ‘We have been experiencing the worst drought in decades and he had never been out in a rain storm, and the simple pleasure of splashing in a puddle was new to him.

"Gay rights activists are protesting new TLC show 'My Husband's Not Gay', claiming the show's stars are actively trying to advertise a discredited therapy program that claims to turn homosexual men straight. The show, which airs tonight, follows four men who admit they are attracted to other men, but are living as heterosexuals in order to follow their Mormon faith, which doesn't recognize gay marriages. Groups like GLAAD has called the show 'irresponsible' and 'dangerous' for portraying sexuality as a choice that can be changed with therapy programs. While TLC has staunchly denied that the show condones these programs, it has now been revealed that at least three of the stars are spokespeople for organizations which practice this discredited method. Scroll down for video . His 'choice': Preston and Megan Dalgren are one of the three married couples profiled on new TLC show 'My Husband's Not Gay'. The men on the reality show admit that they are attracted to other men, but have chosen to live as heterosexuals because of their Mormon faith . Promoters: It has now been revealed that the Dalgrens and co-star Jeff Bennion (pictured) are spokespeople for a group that promotes a therapy program to turn homosexual men straight . Outrage: As of Sunday, more than 123,000 people had signed an online petition to get the show cancelled. Network TLC has refused to back down, and the show is set to air tonight at 10pm . His story: Pret Dahlgren was the former chairman of Evergreen International, a Mormon group which promoted a therapy to help homosexual men ignore their urges and live as heterosexuals. Pictured above speaking at a conference on the issue in 2012 . GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis recently described what is so dangerous about these therapy programs in a recent interview. 'Basically, gay reparative therapy is the notion that you can take the gay out of somebody, which we know is not true,' Ellis told Entertainment Tonight . 'Medical experts have debunked that for ages now, and also it's illegal in a lot of states.' Married couple Preston and Megan Dahlgren have both acted as spokesmen for three such organizations - North Star International, Evergreen International and People Can Change. Before it was absorbed into North Star last year, Pret Dahlgren was the chairman of Evergreen International, a LDS organization that promoted 'reparative therapy' for those with 'same-sex attraction'. The therapy - pioneered by the group Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity - has not been supported in the psychological community which recognizes homosexuality as a normal human orientation. While it was still running, the group advertised therapy that helped people 'diminish...same-gender attractions and overcome homosexual behavior'. At a 2012 conference, Dahlgren even gave a speech about his own struggles with 'same-sex attraction' which he said 'are almost invariably rooted in deeper issues'. In another video from 2013, Dahlgren again promoted 'ex-gay' therapy, saying that he thinks it's possible to prevent these urges. When Evergreen shut down in January 2014, it became absorbed into North Star International, where Dahlgren joined the board.  His wife Megan has been actively involved in both North Star, Evergreen and another similar organization - People Can Change. The Dahlgrens (left) and Bennion (pictured with his wife Tanya, right) have all promoted the gay therapy programs through their respective organizations . Meanwhile, co-star Jeff Bennion,  who is also married to a woman, is the co-founder of North Star and has written many essays on the website. He has also defended 'sexual orientation change efforts'. TLC does not mention the Dalgrens or Bennion's involvement in these organizations in the special, which Salt Lake Tribune TV columnist Scott D Pierce calls a 'clear attempt to deceive the viewers'. It's also strange that the network doesn't mention North Star, since the group claims that all of the stars on the show are involved in their community in an online post. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 123,000 people had signed a petition to have 'My Husband's Not Gay' cancelled.  But TLC has refused to back down and the show is scheduled to air tonight at 10pm ET.","The show follows four men who admit they are attracted to other men, but choose to live as heterosexuals because of their Mormon faith .

"Three French jihadis urge their fellow countrymen to kill the enemies of Allah, 'spit in their faces and run over them with your cars', in the latest propaganda video from ISIS militants. In the seven-minute long video, the men symbolically burn their French passports. They appear bearded and without masks, clutching assault rifles and long-bladed knives. Addressing the camera in French, one of the jihadis exhorts French Muslims to fight unbelievers at home in France if they are unable to travel to Iraq or Syria, saying they have 'cars and weapons available'. The video says it is also possible to kill using poison in either water or food. Scroll down for video . Three French jihadis burned their passports in the latest ISIS propaganda video released on the internet . The first unmasked terrorist, described as Abu Osama al-Faranci, addressed the camera holding a rifle . His comrade Abu Maryam al-Faranci, warned the people of France he would cut off their heads . The video, which has high production values, is subtitled in both Arabic and English. The burning of a passport is a common ritual ceremony practiced by new foreign fighters who have left their homelands and travelled to fight for ISIS. It is seen as a sign of loyalty to the group and a renouncement of their nationality and old identity. Thousands of foreigners are believed to have travelled Iraq and Syria to join ISIS, the militant group also known as Islamic State that has captured a huge area along the borders of the two nations and is imposing brutal rule. Military forces fighting the militants are being supported by bombing raids by British, US, French and other countries forces. ISIS regularly issues chilling videos showing beheadings of captured prisoners, foreign aid workers and journalists and other atrocities. The videos condemn governments and urge Muslims to follow their extreme version of the religion. The latest video opens with a masked fighter speaking in fluent French, praising the Muslims who have travelled to Syria and Iraq and denounced the Western ideas of democracy and nationalism. The camera shows a small group of ISIS fighters standing in a circle around a fire. They smile as they throw their passports into the fire. Some of the men take their time to slowly place their passport in the fire, while others simply throw their identity documents into the flames. Only four don’t have their faces covered with a scarf. The French speaking masked fighter declares: 'You have oppressed us, fought our religion and insulted our Prophet (peace be upon him.) And today, we disbelieve in you and your passports, and if you come here we will fight you.' Abu Salman al-Faranci, centre, warned that people living in France were not safe from ISIS . He urged French Muslims to poison the water and food 'of at least one of the enemies of Allah' The group are then shown sitting down, with the three unmasked French men positioned in the middle. The three French men take it in turns to urge Muslims in France to travel to Syria and Iraq and fight for ISIS. According the video, which was released by the ISIS propaganda unit Al Hayat Media Center, the men are called Abu Osama al-Faranci, Abu Maryam al-Faranci and Abu Salman al-Faranci. Abu Osama al-Firanci declares that jihad is 'the path of Allah' and questions why all French Muslims haven’t joined ISIS. One of the terrorists appears to be holding a US-made AR-15 assault rifle, pictured . 'What are you waiting for?' he says. 'Why do you not perform Hijra? How do you accept to work in the land of Kufr (disbelievers) when Allah has opened a door for you to perform the best of deeds.' He continues to berate French Muslims for paying taxes and strengthening the economy, insisting the French government use the money to 'fight us, and kill our sisters, our women and our children'. He urges Muslims to leave France, warning that 'a day may come when the borders will be closed and you will be left only with tears and regret'. He goes on to praise the French nationals who have travelled to Syria, particularly the pregnant women who have made the dangerous journey. He added: 'The road is easy so there are no excuses for you.' He even claimed they should 'kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars' He warned that ISIS had weapons and cars available in France along with potential targets 'ready to be hit' Another French speaker, Abu Maryam al-Faranci, holding a large sword and an AK-47 assault rifle, boasts that ISIS fighters 'will not hesitate to cut your heads' if the French government keeps bombing Iraq and Syria. He warns that French civilians 'will even fear travelling to the market'. Abu Maryam calls on French Muslims to wage jihad. He refers to the banning of the niqab in France, declaring 'What are you waiting for? Do you not look around you?' He claims the Islamic State is 'ruled by the Shariah of Allah and gives every Muslim his due rights.' The final French fighter, referred to as Abu Salman al-Faransi, urged any French Muslim who cannot travel to Syria to wage jihad at home. Abu Salman says Muslims in France should target civilians on the streets and to use any means possible to cause maximum suffering. 'Terrorise them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror. There are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit. Even poison is available, so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of Allah,' he says. He said: 'Kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars. Do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them, for they deserve only this.' He ends the video by ordering women and children to come and live under Islamic State, vowing there will be 'generations who will fight you O crusaders.' One of the fighters in the video is seen brandishing a US-made AR-15 assault rifle. The video comes just days after a two French nationals were shown on video taking part in a mass systematic execution of 18 Syrian air force soldiers at an unknown site believed to be in the swathe of territory in northern Iraq and Syria captured by ISIS militants.","They urge Muslims to slay non-believers at home if they can't travel to Iraq .

"Learning a language has long been known to boost brainpower. But a new study suggests the effects extend to those who begin from the age of 10 . Learning a second language in early childhood has long been known to boost brainpower . But a new study suggests that the effects extend to those who learn a language from the age of 10 onwards. The research found that people who began learning English in middle childhood showed improvements in the structure of the brain's white matter. These 'higher levels of structural integrity' were in areas responsible for language learning and semantic processing. The findings mirror observations from previous studies that found these improvements in people who learned a second language at a much earlier age. Researchers studied brain scans from 20 people, all around the age of 30, who had lived in Britain for at least 13 months. They had all started learning English as a second language around age 10. Their imaging analyses were compared to 25 people of similar age who spoke only English. 'Everyday handling of more than one language functions as an intensive cognitive stimulation that benefits specific language-related brain structures by preserving their integrity, and therefore it protects them against deterioration in older age,' said the study led by Christos Pliatsikas of the University of Kent School of Psychology. Since previous studies had mostly relied on people who learned two or more languages beginning in infancy, scientists say more research is needed to close in on exactly when these positive brain changes begin to take root. The research follows a similar study in June which found that Learning to speak a second language at any point in your life could help keep your brain sharp as you age, a study suggests.

"Dressed in a white headscarf and hooded coat, this is France’s most wanted woman arriving in Turkey en route to the Syrian war zone. Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, reached Istanbul a week before her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, carried out the Paris atrocity at a Jewish deli store. In the video, released by the Turkish authorities yesterday, Boumeddiene and a male companion calmly hand over their passports to a border guard who stamps them, passes them back and sends them on their way. Video has emerged believed to show Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Amedy Coulibaly, at Istanbul airport . In the video, she is shown handing over her passport - Turkey's Prime Minister said she arrived on January 2 . The man is believed to be Mehdi Sabri Belhoucine, a 23-year-old Frenchman who is also on the intelligence services’ watch list. Described as armed and dangerous, Boumeddiene is wanted in connection with last week’s terror attacks on Paris which left 17 people dead. She is believed to have helped mastermind the plot, which saw Coulibaly shoot dead a policewoman and execute four hostages at the deli. Coulibaly, 32, was in the same terror cell as the Kouachi brothers – Cherif, 32, and Said, 34 – who killed 12 in the Charlie Hebdo magazine attack. The three men were killed minutes apart by the French security services. Intelligence sources in France believe Boumeddiene could have helped plan the attacks, possibly by supplying weapons. She was initially thought to have been involved in the siege at the kosher store last Friday but it has since emerged she had in fact fled Paris a week earlier, arriving in Turkey on January 2. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Boumeddiene arrived in Istanbul from Madrid on January 2 and crossed the border on January 8 . She is now thought to be in Syria with Islamic State fighters. The pictures were released as a close friend called for her to hand herself in to authorities and seek forgiveness. The woman, who went to school with Boumeddiene, said she did not believe her friend could have been involved in the attacks but may have been implicated because of her infatuation with her husband, a petty criminal radicalised in prison. Hayat Boumeddiene, the fugitive widow of the French gunman, who killed a policewoman and four hostages when he held up a kosher supermarket in Paris . Asked what she would say to her friend if she could speak to her, she told Le Parisian newspaper: ‘I would say, “If you’re part of it, give yourself in and returned to France”. She must repent and ask forgiveness for what has happened.’ The CCTV pictures show Boumeddiene arriving at Istanbul’s Sabiha Gokcen international airport on January 2, having taken a flight from Madrid. Once in Turkey, she and Belhoucine stayed at Bade Otel, a high-rise hotel in Istanbul, where rooms cost around £38 a night. They had posed as tourists in the ancient city. They then travelled more than 800 miles to the Turkish city of Sanliurfa, close to the Syrian border. She crossed into Syria on January 8, Turkish authorities said. On the same day in Paris her husband shot dead a 27-year-old trainee policewoman in southern Paris and seriously injured a street cleaner who tried to detain him. Turkish authorities tracked the pair listening in to phone calls and used the mobile data to plot the path they took. Turkey’s Yeni Safak newspaper reported that the country’s intelligence agency took action following reports that Boumeddiene was in Turkey and put her under surveillance due to her ‘suspicious behaviour’. Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey’s foreign minister, said: ‘We provided the French with the information as soon as we got it, without them even asking.’ The 26-year-old is now thought to be with her murderous Islamic State allies in Syria after fleeing France. The couple are pictured on a beach . Boumeddiene, posing with a lethal weapon in Murat, central France, in 2010. It has emerged that she and her husband were questioned over the failed escape of Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from prison . Boumeddiene is believed to have met Coulibaly, pictured left, in Juvisy-sur-Orge, south-east of Paris, while working as a cashier . Coulibaly first came to the attention of police as a teenager and was later convicted of a string of drug and theft offences. He was killed as commandos stormed the kosher supermarket in the French capital . The prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said Turkey should not be blamed for admitting Boumeddiene because there was no arrest notice. She and the three Paris killers were all known to the security services. Yet despite their fanatical hatred of the West and access to weapons, police decided to stop tracking them in July 2014 as they were considered low risk. Boumeddiene’s friend added: ‘Once when we were discussing religion, she advised me to leave France, where veiled women are sometimes insulted. She told me: “France is a country that is useless”. ‘Amedy was behind bars, she was alone, distressed and distraught. They were very much in love and spent a lot of time together.’","Hayat Boumeddiene was married to supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly .

"It is 11 years since it captured the imagination of a nation. Now, space probe Beagle 2 is creating excitement all over again. The UK Space Agency has announced it will be giving an ‘update’ on the ill-fated British-led mission to Mars on Friday – fuelling speculation that the dustbin lid-sized probe has finally been found. A speaker list that includes the mission’s project manager, a scientist who help choose Beagle 2’s landing site and the European Space Agency’s director of science, has only added to the mystery. Leading space scientist Professor John Zarnecki said that finding the probe would be ‘wonderful’. Scroll down for video . A picture depicting Beagle 2 on the surface of Mars which was released in May 2002. The probe was supposed to land on the Red Planet on Christmas Day in 2003 . Professor Pillinger, who died last year from a brain haemorhage, never lived to discover what had happened to his probe . A model of the Beagle 2 Lander craft, which was about the size of an open umbrella, at Sandy Quarry in Bedfordshire in southern England . The brainchild of Colin Pillinger, a maverick scientist with a gift for PR, and built on a shoestring budget, Beagle 2 was designed to search for signs of life, past or present on the Red Planet. Britpop band Blur composed the probe’s call sign and the ‘test card’ used to calibrate probes cameras was painted by Damien Hirst. Due to land on Christmas Day, 2003, the £50million spacecraft was last seen heading for Mars six days earlier on December 19, 2003. The Blur song was never relayed to Earth, the tiny craft was officially declared lost in January 2004 and nothing has been heard from it since. Experts concluded it had fallen foul of an extra-thin Martian atmosphere – leading to it travelling too fast on its approach for its parachute to deploy properly and hitting the ground too hard. However, those involved refused to give up hope. Dr Mark Sims Beagle 2’s mission manager and one of the speakers at Friday’s three-hour-long press conference, said at the time: ‘My nightmare is that Beagle is sat there on the surface of Mars still trying to talk to us and, for the sake of a broken cable, it’s not.’ Scientists operating the HiRise camera on Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) will take part in the press conference. The HiRise camera can scan the surface of Mars in high enough detail to spot missing spacecraft and has already helped to locate the twin Viking landers which touched down on Mars in the Seventies. They have been searching for Beagle 2 for several years. Blur members Dave Rowntree (left) and Alex James (right) with Professor Colin Pillinger (centre) and the Beagle 2 before its launch. Blur composed the probe’s call sign . Musician Damon Albarn of Blur painted the ‘test card’ used to calibrate  cameras on the probe . In 2005, Professor Pillinger called an impromptu press conference, convinced that a speck on a photo of the surface of Mars was his lost probe. Later, higher-resolution imagery from Nasa showed he had been mistaken. He never lived to discover what had happened to his probe. On his death last year following a brain haemorrhage, Professor Pillinger, 71, was described as ‘an archetype eccentric professor’ – and the Beagle 2 mission as an ‘heroic failure’. Last night, leading scientists said that the probe may, just may, have been spotted by craft orbiting Mars. Professor Zarnecki, a former Open University colleague of Professor Pillinger, said: ‘I don’t know what they will announce. All one can think of is that they might have got an image of the probe. ‘When dear old Colin was alive, he was seeing Beagle in single pixels. ‘None of us could see it - he was the only one who could. So if they really have found it this time, it would be wonderful.’ The Beagle 2 lander was designed to look for evidence of life on Isidis Planitia, a large, flat sedimentary basin on Mars . British scientists used the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in Macclesfield to search for signs of the Beagle 2 . The professor, who had his own experiment on board Beagle 2, a tiny weather station, said that while there is no chance the probe could still work, any find could provide important information about why the mission failed. Professor Zarnecki said: ‘One of the reasons why space missions on the whole are so successful is that we do learn from experience. It is similar to why flying by plane is so safe - we learn from failures.’ Dr Lewis Dartnell, a UK space agency researcher, said that if Beagle 2 is still fairly intact, it would be visible to craft orbiting Mars. Fragments of wreckage, however, would be much harder to spot. The UK Space Agency will only say that Friday’s announcement concerns Beagle 2’s landing – and will ‘definitely be of interest’.","Beagle 2 was due to land on Mars on Christmas Day, 2003 .

"Patients will be hit with a new $20 fee to see their doctor when changes to Medicare are implemented next week, with some doctors warning it could destroy free universal healthcare. The changes, introduced by the Abbott government to cut costs, will see Medicare pay $20.10 less for consultations under 10 minutes from January 19, Fairfax Media reports. These short visits lasting from six to 10 minutes are referred to as Level B consultations and can include patients after new prescriptions for regular medication. Medicare has paid $37.05 towards these visits for years but will now pay $16.95. Scroll down for video . The changes, introduced by the Abbott government to cut costs, will see Medicare pay $20.10 less for consultations under 10 minutes from January 19 . The change may prompt doctors to stop bulk billing these shorter consultations and start charging patients to cover costs. Medicare has paid a $37.05 rebate for a GP consultation under 10 minutes. This will change to $16.95 from January 19. Doctors will absorb the cost if they bulk-bill. If they don't bulk-bill, patients will receive a $16.95 rebate. This will change the out of pocket amount depending on what doctors charge. It comes alongside the $5 cut to Medicare rebates for non-concessional patients from July. People without a concession who see a doctor for under 10 minutes will receive an $11.95 rebate. A further $5 cut to GP rebates comes in from July 1, on top of a near-six year freeze on Medicare rebate indexation. While the Abbott government scrapped its plan for a $7 Medicare co-payment before Christmas, Australian Medical Association's vice president, Dr Stephen Parnis, said new changes were 'wrecking balls' that would effect the way general practice and medicine is conducted in Australia. 'They dumped the $7 co-payment fee and introduced three big changes that were a bit different,' he told the Today show. 'One was a cut in the nature of level A or level B payments, the $5 co-payment instead of $7 coming from July and a freeze on Medicare rebates until 2018.' Dr Parnis said the shift in costs would have a profound impact on the way GPs do their work. 'I think it's going to be devastating because it will discourage people from going to the doctor,' he said. Australian Medical Association's vice president, Dr Stephen Parnis, said new changes were 'wrecking balls' that would effect the way general practice and medicine is conducted in Australia . Dr Parnis said doctors were unlikely to absorb the change in cost and it's likely it will passed on to patients . 'They'll present later with more serious problems - it also means they might go to other parts of the health system such as hospital emergency departments.' Dr Parnis said doctors were unlikely to absorb the change in cost. 'Well if you're taking a cut of more than 55 percent with more to come in July, how can you possibly run a business? This is going to have a huge impact on access to care,' he said. 'There is nothing good about this.' The government says doctors who want to charge for a standard GP consultation will now need to spend at least 10 minutes with a patient to attract the standard Level B consultation rebate. The Australian Medical Association fears this will blow out GP waiting times. A spokesman for Health Minister Sussan Ley told Fairfax Media the changes to GP visits less than 10 minutes were designed to encourage longer consultations. 'Under the current rules, a GP can access Medicare rebates for up to 20 minutes, even if their patient is in and out the door in six minutes,' he said. A spokesman for Health Minister Sussan Ley told Fairfax Media the changes to GP visits less than 10 minutes were designed to encourage longer consultations . Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the government would ditch plans for the controversial $7 Medicare co-payment in December. Instead, an optional co-payment would be introduced at the same time the Medicare rebate to GPs is reduced by $5. It will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them. Incentives to bulk bill children under 16, concession card holders, pensioners and veterans will remain in place. The new measures will come into place from July. The latest change in GP costs comes alongside the $5 cut to Medicare rebates for consultations for non-concessional patients from July. People without a concession who see a doctor for under 10 minutes will receive an $11.95 rebate.","Changes to Medicare include a $20 cut to the Medicare rebate for GP Level B consultations lasting less than 10 minutes .

"A woman has lost 10 stone after being humiliated on her birthday by a DJ who shouted out 'Happy 21st birthday – and congratulations on hitting 21 stone.' But Gemma Howard, who actually weighed 25 stone, got the last laugh as she returned to the same club on her 30th birthday weighing 14st 10lbs. After spending almost a decade smarting from the cruel jibe, Gemma, 32, from Luton, Beds, decided to lose 10 stone in the year before she turned 30. Gemma Howard, 32, from Luton, weighed 25 stone when she turned 21 (left). She celebrated her birthday local nightclub where the DJ wished her happy birthday but also announced she had hit 21 stone. She vowed to lose 10 stone before returning. Gemma has since lost 12 stone (right) When Gemma approached the DJ, he did not recognise her – so she told him who she was. He gave her a bottle of champagne and apologised – admitting to the crowd what he had done. And he confessed she now weighed less than him. Recounting the original incident, Gemma, 32, of Luton, Beds, told how excited she was about her 21st in March, 2003. She said: 'We decided to celebrate at Flame nightclub in town. 'I was wearing a black mesh top and tiara. 'I wasn't a size 10 but I still thought I scrubbed up pretty well. 'The reality? I was 25 stone and bulging out of my outfit. I guess I was in denial.' Gemma at the nightclub on her 21st birthday, where she was taunted by he DJ over her weight . Growing up, Gemma ate all the wrong things - she loved fast food and big family meals. At school, the boys in her class would save up their lunches and throw sandwiches at her outside the school gates. Gemma would pretend she didn't care, but would go home and comfort eat to feel better. By the time she got to college, she was 23 stone. She said: 'I'd pretend to be bubbly and confident, but deep down I think I knew I was faking it. 'I spent a lot of time in gay clubs and bars - mainly because I wouldn't get rejected there! 'So for my 21st birthday we went to one, Flame. I'd been before and always had fun. 'When we arrived, my mate Ian bought a bottle of champagne and told the drag act DJ, Nick, it was my birthday. 'Nick then announced, ""Happy 21st birthday Gemma,"" while my friends cheered and raised their glasses. 'But then he laughed and said, ""And congratulations for turning 21 stone!"" 'People turned to stare, the humiliation was too much and I burst into tears, as my friends bundled me into the toilet to calm me down.' Gemma with her friend Ian, who has been her rock throughout her weight loss . Gemma tried to put on a brave face but her night was completely ruined. After that she avoided going back to that nightclub as she couldn't face seeing the DJ again. Gemma spent a lot of her twenties in other gay clubs though, feeling too self conscious to go out anywhere else. And when it came to boyfriends, she never felt good enough for anybody. She said: 'Those horrible words, ""Congratulations for turning 21 stone"" were always ringing in my ears. 'I tried dieting but I'd lose five stone then put it all back on - the idea of being fat when I turned 30 filled me with dread though. 'I was determined to have a better time celebrating than at my 21st.' Growing up, Gemma ate all the wrong things - she loved fast food and big family meals.At school, the boys in her class would save up their lunches and throw sandwiches at her outside the school gates . So in September 2011, Gemma started the Cambridge Weight Plan which involves shakes, soups and bars. She was determined to lose 10 stone in a year - before her 30th. Then her friend Ian suggested they celebrate it at that same nightclub - Flame. She said: 'Even nine years on, the memory of that night hadn't got any less painful. 'I told Ian I didn't think I could go, but then the more I thought about it, the more I realised it could be the perfect motivation - every time I craved a big packet of crisps, I thought of my humiliating 21st. 'I told all my mates who'd been there with me nine years earlier, and my new mates were all filled in on the story.' By March 2012, Gemma weighed 14st 10lbs - after losing more than 10 stone. Before her birthday night out at Flame, she treated herself to a new short red dress and had a spray tan. Gemma on her 30th birthday with the DJ who initially made fun of her weight . She said: 'When I walked into that club, I had my head held high. 'The same DJ was spinning the decks. Ian asked him to wish me happy birthday and pointed in my direction, ""'Happy 30th Gemma,"" he announced, ushering me up onto the stage. 'I was full of confidence as I strutted over. He said he hardly recognised me, and gave me a bottle of champagne. 'Then he announced to the room, ""Nine years ago I congratulated Gemma on being 21 stone, now she weighs less than me! You look amazing - congratulations and happy birthday!"" 'It meant a lot to me and I had a fantastic night. 'Since then I've lost another two stone and I'm still shedding the pounds. 'That humiliating experience may have ruined my 21st birthday, but it made my 30th my best yet.'","Gemma Howard, 32, from Luton, celebrated turning 21 at a local nightclub .

"A train operator's most popular morning commuter train to London did not run on time once in a whole year, statistics have revealed. Rail company Southern  failed to get the 7.29am Brighton to London Victoria train into the capital within its scheduled time on any occasion out of 240 attempts. The service is the most essential for commuters who live in Brighton, East Sussex, but work in London as it is scheduled to arrive at its final destination at 8.35am - just in time for a 9am start time. Delayed: Rail company Southern failed to get the 7.29am Brighton to London Victoria train into the capital within its scheduled time on any occasion out of 240 attempts last year . The revelation comes a week after commuters, some of whom pay up to £5,000 a year for a season ticket from Brighton to London, were dealt 2.5 per cent price rises on their rail fares from January 2. Trains either side of the 7.29 service to London Victoria, the 7.14 and the 7.44, only arrived in the capital on time on 1 per cent and 2 per cent of occasions, according to the new figures released by Network Rail. Nationally, more than a third of trains failed to arrive on time in the 12 months ending December 6, with 64.6 per cent reaching their destination within 59 seconds of their scheduled arrival. Only 50.3 per cent of Southern trains made it within the 59-second limit. Southern Rail deputy managing director David Scorey apologised for poor performance but stressed work was underway to improve the service. Questioned on whether commuters were getting their money’s worth last week, he declined to answer yes or no. Work: Southern Rail deputy managing director David Scorey apologised for poor performance but stressed work was underway to improve the service . 'I don’t think we’re delivering the level of performance customers expect,' he said. 'We are delivering in a lot of areas, including investment and innovation, but not on performance. We’re doing more in that area, that’s a major area we’re focusing on.' Southern say the poor performance of the 7.29 train and other services across the network is primarily down to high demand and congestion. However the 7.29 service was cancelled twice last week - on one occasion because of a faulty door lock. Asked what the problem was with the 7.29, Mr Scorey said it was 'all because of the balance between capacity and performance on the network'. He said: 'Our network is very busy and congested. An analogy that I’d use is the M25 at its busiest time. Our network is a bit like that and what we’re trying to do is run as many trains as we can because the capacity is needed. People want those trains, want seats on the trains, want trains to be as long as they can because there is demand for it. 'But it does mean that trains are running very, very close together - particularly as they approach London. If there is the most minor of problem or delay on a train, another train can be thrown off its path or slot on the network by a couple of minutes which can sometimes then snowball a little to five or six minutes late. 'We’ve identified some issues with the 7.29, with the way it interacts with other services, but the timetable and the capacity demand is so intense that some of the options of what we can do are quite limited.' Southern gained more than £700 million in revenue in 2013. Its parent company Govia - a firm jointly-owned by the French National Railway company Keolis - last year received more than £700 million in net public subsidies from taxpayers. Its shareholders also enjoyed more than £21 million in dividends. Mr Scorey added: 'There’s the delay repay system which compensates passengers for delays over a certain threshold, but I think it’s worth reflecting if you look back over the Southern franchise, that we’ve done a tremendous amount of work. Destination: Trains either side of the 7.29 service to London Victoria (pictured), the 7.14 and the 7.44, arrived in the capital on time on 1 per cent and 2 per cent of occasions, according to  figures released by Network Rail . Busy period: Asked what the problem was with Southern's 7.29 service, Mr Scorey said it was 'all because of the balance between capacity and performance on the network' 'I’d ask people to reflect on how the network has changed over the past decade, say. We’ve introduced a complete new fleet of trains, the Electrostar fleet, we’ve introduced extra seats from Brighton and in fact a lot of those trains still have spare capacity today. 'We’ve invested hugely in stations, and Brighton station is a great example of the work that’s been done. 'We will continue to work on performance but it’s about setting that off against successes as well that I think we’ve achieved on the network.' In an attempt to reassure customers, Mr Scorey concluded: 'There are a number of other changes coming this year, including a timetable recast in December. 'Southern becomes part of Govia Thameslink Railway in July and that gives us the opportunity to review the Brighton mainline timetable and to construct it in a better way. We’re out for consultation on that at the moment.' Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, who commutes most days to the capital from Brighton, has called for an urgent summit to address the ongoing rail misery impacting her constituents. Campaign: Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, who commutes most days to the capital from Brighton, has called for an urgent summit to address the  rail misery impacting her constituents . 'My constituents are fed up with unreliable, overcrowded and over-priced trains,' she said. 'I’ve been inundated by letters and emails from passengers who have had to experience cancelled trains, late running services, overcrowded trains and platforms, and pitiful communications systems. She added: 'Longer term, we need to fix the fragmentation of our railway system through bringing rail back into public ownership.' Commuters on the service also had their say on the delays, and offered their ideas for a possible solution. Train user Magnus Kemp, from Brighton said: 'I don’t expect to arrive on time. The train always slows down. The Brits put up with it but it’s always been the same, trains have always been bad in this country. 'Where is there a good train service in the UK? Should we renationalise? I mean, on certain levels yes. 'But I can’t see how doing that will make it a better service because when it was nationalised it was rubbish then as well. 'On a different level, maybe it should be but it won’t make a great deal of difference. Do Southern staff get performance-related pay? Maybe that will help.' Joe Casson, 24, from Brighton, said: 'You budget 10 to 15 minutes for the end of the journey on this train. It’s always late, it never fails. It’s a case of putting up with it as far as I’m concerned. 'You shouldn’t have to assume your train is going to be late every time, you should have dedicated times for your arrival so you can plan your commute to work. 'If targets aren’t met then some money back on a season ticket would be nice. 'You could also adjust the timetable so the arrival time is 10 or 15 minutes later. That way people won’t be misled and Southern will hit their targets. Just an idea.' Giles Wheatley, 44, from Brighton: 'To hear that this train never arrived on time in London at all last year is absolutely of no surprise to me. I can’t remember when it did. It’s frustrating. 'It’s scheduled to arrive at 8.35 which should be enough time to get to work for 9am. But what I have to do, if I have an important meeting, is get up earlier and get the earlier train. That is still late most of the time too but at least I can make work on time. 'There’s also a receptionist at my work in London who also gets this train from Brighton and I’ve heard from her myself that it’s a real problem for her too - like everyone else. It just seems to go slowly when it nears London and you lose time.' One of the best performing operators was the Chiltern train company, which ran 85.1 per cent of its services on time, but the same was true of just 39.1 per cent of services from CrossCountry. The right-time NR figures for the 12 months ending December 6 2014, also showed that Arriva Trains Wales, c2c, and London Overground all had on-time figures in excess of 80 per cent. Contrastingly, only 45.6 per cent of Grand Central’s trains were on time and only 50.9 per cent of Virgin Trains’ services were on time. NR’s performance is judged not on the right-time measure but on the public performance measure (PPM) which deems a commuter service is on time if its arrives within five minutes of scheduled time, with long-distance trains being on time if they arrive within 10 minutes. On this five-minute PPM measure, just 27 per cent of the 7.29am Brighton to London trains were on time last year. The PPM figures for all train companies showed that for the 12 months ending December 6 2014, a total of 89.3 per cent of trains were on time. Top operator was c2c with a punctuality figure of 96.4 per cent, while the worst-performing company was Southern with a figure of 83.4 per cent. A spokesman for Southern said: 'We acknowledge that the performance of the 7.29am Brighton to London Victoria service has been particularly disappointing. 'This is a train that we know has a poor PPM record and although we’re working hard to improve its performance, its planned path is extremely tight because the network is so busy.'","Rail company Southern's morning service failed to run on time last year .

"A teenage student was horrified to wake up after a drunken DIY tattoo party to find friends had inked a penis on her shoulder. Holly Aston, a self-confessed former 'wild child', said the embarrassing tattoo had 'ruined her life' as she cancelled holidays and postponed university because she feared it would be 'revealed'. She was just 17 when she allowed drunken friends to draw 'whatever they wanted' on her with a DIY tattoo gun she had bought on the internet. The teenager from Birmingham, now 20, kept it hidden from her parents for two years, but now the truth has come out. Scroll down for video . Holly Aston was horrified to wake up after a drunken DIY tattoo party to find friends had inked a penis on her shoulder (picture has been partially obscured) 'I had tattoo parties with my mates. We'd have some drinks and tattoo each other - it was stupid,' she said. 'It was during one of those parties that things got out of hand. I let my mates draw whatever they wanted. 'I have the word 'Dyke' on my ankle, and then one drew the penis on my shoulder. I knew what they were doing and didn't mind at the time. It was just a joke and I thought it was funny. 'But then I woke up the next day, looked at it and thought 'Oh God, what have I done?' 'I had to keep it covered up in the summer; if I went swimming I tried to cover it with plasters because I didn't want children seeing it. 'I turned down family holidays because I was hiding it from my mum and dad. I thought they'd kill me.' The self-confessed former 'wild child' also has a tattoo of Storm from X Men on her forearm . Miss Aston has a diploma in animal management and wants to study animal behaviour and welfare, but said she couldn't afford to remove it. 'I want to go to university this year and to be taken seriously without this silly tattoo, but I can't afford the thousands of pounds it would cost to remove it,' she said. She said it was easy to buy a tattoo gun off the internet for about £50, but there was no instructions about keeping it sterile. 'We were very lucky not to get an infection or blood poisoning,' she said. 'I had my first tattoo done by a qualified bloke who had turned part of his house into a studio. 'I had a large picture done on my forearm of a comic book woman. It's supposed to be Storm from X Men, although I just chose it out of a book because I thought it was cool.

"A top lawyer who hid his depression hanged himself on holiday after his bouts of drunken rage forced his wife to flee back to Britain with their two young children. Lahra Tyndall, a BBC Breakfast producer, had persuaded her husband Adrian to see a local doctor while they were away. But he began ranting in the taxi on the way to his appointment and stormed out of the car. After his wife left for the UK, she expected Mr Tyndall to follow her on a later flight. But instead she received a text message from him saying: ‘I came back to the villa and you were all gone. Adrian Tyndall, 44, (left), the lawyer husband of BBC Breakfast producer Lahra, 41, (right) hanged himself after his behaviour led her to leave him behind at their luxury holiday villa in Portugal, an inquest heard . ‘I can’t for the life of me remember what happened once we got in the car, just it was cruel. Try to forgive me. I’m not bad, just weak.’ Portuguese police were alerted but his body was found in their villa by its manager. Mr Tyndall, a specialist in employment law who ran his own practice, having previously worked with top law firm Eversheds, struggled with depression for years, an inquest was told. But he had tried to keep up appearances at home and work because he was ashamed about having the illness. Mrs Tyndall told the hearing: ‘Adrian viewed himself as weak but he wasn’t at all – he tried extremely hard to overcome his problems. The inquest was told that Mr Tyndall's outbursts eventually forced his wife (pictured after the hearing) to fly home to the UK, believing he would follow her . ‘We went to see the mental health nurse, and he was terrified of being sectioned. The nurses put him under the care of the crisis team. I raised with them his sense of shame that was holding him back from recovering. I also talked about his ability to cover things up, pretending he was OK when he wasn’t.’ To block out negative thoughts, Mr Tyndall began drinking heavily, putting a strain on his marriage. Two years ago his wife told him they would have to separate if he didn’t sort out his problems. They had marriage counselling but she later found his wedding ring and a suicide note on a shelf in the house. Then in April last year he was discovered on the bathroom floor of the family home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, with a knife and a bottle of gin. Mr Tyndall agreed to have five sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to address his depression. But his wife told the inquest: ‘He felt embarrassed and scared of his problems and had little or no faith in the CBT.’ The family’s three-week break to the rural area of Ourique in central Portugal was in August last year. But despite pleas from his wife and mental health team not to drink on holiday, Mr Tyndall hit the bottle soon after arriving. He also confessed: ‘I can’t go on like this. I’m too weak. I need to end it all.’ His wife then booked a taxi to take him to see a doctor. She eventually flew home when he became particularly aggressive. ‘Adrian had never behaved like that before,’ she recalled. ‘It was like dealing with a stranger.’ Coroner John Pollard recorded a verdict of suicide.","Lawyer Adrian Tyndall, 44, died last August at villa in Ourique, Portugal .

"Dogs stolen: Walter, 40, and Gemma Clay, 32, with their daughters Isabel, seven, and Robyn, one . A family of four have been left devastated after five of their dogs were stolen from their garden, with one of them on the verge of having a litter. Sisters Isabel, seven, and Robyn Clay, one, are upset after their pets were snatched in the night from their home near Bradford, West Yorkshire. Bella the Jack Russell, who is due to give birth to a litter today, was among the five bitches stolen in the raid, leaving the family distraught. Others taken included Schnauzer dogs Sugar and Mathilda, and Jack Russells Tiny and Ruby. The family are appealing for the thieves to hand themselves in after the pets were discovered missing from their kennels last week. Mother Gemma Clay, 32, said: ‘My daughters are devastated. They spend so much time with the dogs around the farm. They are really into them and can’t bear to be without them. ‘Isabel is gutted. She was beside herself when I picked her up from school and told her. She can’t understand why it happened. She keeps asking why bad men would be so cruel.’ The registered dog breeder added: ‘My one-year-old Robyn is also devastated. I don’t think she quite understands what happened. ‘She sits and plays with them all the time in the kitchen so to be without them is upsetting for her. She can’t talk properly yet but just keeps saying “woof, woof”, hoping they’ll answer.’ Mrs Clay, whose husband Walter, 40, is a full-time farmer, said the theft came to light when they found the kennels had been broken into and the canines’ beds empty on Thursday morning. Gone: Bella the Jack Russell, who is due to give birth to a litter today, was among the five dogs stolen . Tiny the Jack Russell: The family are appealing for the thieves to hand themselves in after the pets were discovered missing from their kennels last week . Concern: The family are particularly worried about Sugar, four, as she had recently had a litter or her own . Taken by thieves: The other missing Schnauzer from the Clay household is Mathilda, also four, who is grey . On a lead: Ruby is a rough-coated black and white dog aged three of the Jack Russell breed . She explained: ‘Walter had been working late the night before and everything seemed fine. But when he was out early the next morning he saw they were gone. ‘We have a back building where the dogs stay and one of the panels was missing. He thought it was just the wind, but when we both looked we saw someone had barged through three doors and taken our five girls. ‘Our other Jack Russell, Stanley, was running round wondering where his friends were. We are most concerned about Bella as she is about to give birth any day now, and you can see by looking at her swollen belly. I’m just heartbroken that someone would take a dog when she’s so vulnerable. ‘I don’t tell many people about our dogs because I know they’re valuable - I’ve been very careful about it in the past. Despite their value, they are all just lovely little dogs and so sweet-natured. Isabel with Sugar: The girl is devastated after her five dogs were snatched in the night from outside her home . Isabel with Bella: The family's dog has been described as a tan and white Jack Russell aged four . 'Gutted': Mrs Clay (left) said Isabel (right) was 'beside herself when I picked her up from school and told her' 'They love our girls to bits. They are all micro-chipped too. That’s probably why we didn’t hear them when they were taken - with our dogs no visitor is unwanted so they wouldn’t have put up a protest.’ Jack Russell pups can fetch £350 while miniature Schnauzers are worth £800. Bella has been described as a tan and white Jack Russell aged four, while Ruby is a rough-coated black and white  dog aged three of the same breed. The missing Schnauzers are Mathilda, four, who is grey, and four-year-old Sugar who has a fluffy white coat. Mrs Clay said they were also particularly worried about Sugar as she had recently had a litter of her own. She added: ‘We just want to make life as awkward as possible for whoever is responsible by letting them know how heartbroken we are - especially Isabel and Robyn. They just want their friends back safe on the farm.’ Sergeant James Firth, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ‘We would urge anyone with information about this offence or the whereabouts of any of the stolen dogs to call us.’","Dogs snatched from kennels outside Clay family home near Bradford .

"After rubbing shoulders at 18 with the heir to the throne and an actor now tipped for an Oscar, these Eton chums might have been afraid they would be outmatched at any school reunion. But pity them not, for after having the best start in life nearly half gone on to lucrative careers in the City - earning certainly more than enough to ensure their children can benefit from similar privileges. Of the 18 members of the year 2000 Eton Society not taking Hollywood by storm or waiting to be crowned king, eight have leveraged their early experiences of having lots money to get into jobs looking after other people's wealth. Scroll down for video . The Eton Society: Edward King (1), James Parry (2), Ivo Stourton (3), Alexander True (4), Ed Millais (5), David Ferreira (6), Tristan Rodgers (7), Matt Lowe (8), Harry Walsh (9), Alastair Balfour (10), Eddie Redmayne (11), Jamie Wrightson (12), Tomas Stael von Holstein (13), Dave Walston (14), Harry Aubrey-Fletcher (15), Tom Roberts (16), Vachan Kashyap (17), Hamish Barne (18), Tony Selwyn (19), Prince William (20) And from what can be gleaned about them online, the rest have also enjoyed their fair share of success in their chosen fields, from the academia to law to classical music. Prince William is second in line to the throne, while Eddie Redmayne, fresh from his Golden Globe win, is fast earning himself a place among Hollywood royalty. But they are not the only high profile alumni of Eton's class of 2000, with Matt Lowe - a music scholarship student and the Eton Society president - now regularly playing cello with some of the biggest names in classical music. The eight who have gone into finance are Alexander True, David Ferreira, Tristan Rodgers, Harry Walsh, Alastair Balfour, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Tom Roberts and Vachan Kashyap. Two more are lawyers (including one who combines that profession with a sideline in writing novels), one has recently left the army, one is a Cambridge academic, one works in shipping, one in engineering and another as an entrepreneur in the holistic wellness industry. Just one has totally renounced the path of corporate progression. Ed Millais abandoned a career as a barrister to become an apprentice in the Church of England and is now working in the inner city (but hardly gritty) parish of Kensington. As well as helping out with parents' evenings and school tours, members of the group upheld a centuries old tradition of the society - to wear their own individually designed waistcoat. Prince William can be seen in the photo, taken in 2000, in a waistcoat made from an Aston Villa shirt while Redmayne, recently named GQ Magazine's Best Dressed Man, is seen in a pink and black number. Eddie Redmayne won a Best Actor Golden Globe for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in the Theory of Everything at the awards last night . Redmayne stars as Stephen Hawking alongside Felicity Jones in the film, which deals with his motor neurone disease diagnosis and success . The actor previously told how he played rugby with Prince William at school, and described him as a 'wonderful man' who he reportedly felt sorry for, because everyone wanted to tackle the future King of England. While Prince William went on to study geography at St Andrews, Redmayne went to Cambridge to read History of Art - the same course as the Duchess of Cambridge. Eddie Redmayne took home a Golden Globe last night for best actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Redmayne, who shot to fame when he appeared in Birdsong, beat off competition from Steve Carell in Foxcatcher, Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler, Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game and David Oyelowo in Selma. The English actor, who was previously the face of Burberry, stars as real-life theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, in the James Marsh directed film. Eddie Redmayne picked up a best actor Golden Globe award last night . Eddie Redmayne was born and raised in London. He went to Eton College and was in the same year as Prince William. Redmayne went on to study History of Art at Trinty College at Cambridge. His first stage performance was in a West End production of Oliver! and in 2002 he appeared as Viola in Twelfth Night at Shakespeare's Globe. His appearance earned him many accolades, including being named the most outstanding newcomer by the Evening Standard in 2004. Redmayne has had a successful stage career,  appearing in Red at the Donmar Warehouse in London in 2009 which earned him an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The play transferred to Broadway in 2010 and Redmayne went on to win a Tony Award for his performance. In film he is known for his roles in The Other Boleyn Girl, My Week with Marilyn and Savage Grace. He has also appeared in a number of television productions including Birdsong, Tess of the d'Urbevilles and The Pillars of the Earth. Redmayne's talents have also extended to modelling and he modelled for Burberry in 2008, appearing with Cara Delevingne in 2012. The actor's appearance also led him to be named on the International Best Dressed List in the September 2012 edition of Vanity Fair. He was also recently named best dressed man by GQ magazine in recognition of his dapper outfits. He has also received a SAG Award nomination and his name is a favourite to be mentioned later this week when Oscar nominations are announced. The actor married Hannah Bagshawe less than a month ago and was seen on the red carpet, dressed in a velvet suit, with his new wife on Sunday evening. They married on December 15 after two years of dating, having become engaged on a romantic holiday in June that year. Bookmaker Coral has slashed the odds on Eddie Redmayne winning the Oscar for Best Actor next month, after his Golden Globe win. The British star is now the 11-10 second favourite to triumph, with his biggest rival being Michael Keaton who is edging ahead as the 4-5 favourite.

"Acid attack victim turned TV presenter Katie Piper has announced her engagement. The 31-year-old shared her happy news on Twitter this morning where she told fans her carpenter boyfriend James had got down on one knee. She tweeted: 'So excited to tell you all.............. I became someone's fiancé last night! I'm engaged to be married :)'. Scroll down for video . Katie Piper has announced her engagement to carpenter boyfriend James on Twitter this morning . She posted the tweet on Saturday morning where she told fans she is due to be married after proposal last night . It is thought the pair dressed up for a romantic evening and a three-course dinner at their home in London yesterday. She posted a picture on Instagram last night of her meal of baked cod capers, cooked by her now fiance and father of their baby daughter, Belle Elizabeth, who was born in March this year. Alongside the pictures she wrote: 'Pretending we are going out for dinner! Cooking 3 course meal, dressed in our best clothes- all taking place at our kitchen table! Parents night in/out #nobabysitterneeded.' With her second snap she posted: 'I think my boyfriend has potential as a chef! Baked Cod with Capers,' before making the big announcement on Twitter today. The presenter posted this image on her Instagram last night where she told fans she was enjoying a three course meal at home with her boyfriend . Katie gave birth to baby daughter Belle Elizabeth in March this year. Her due date was Thursday, March 27, 2014 - the date of the six-year anniversary of when she was raped by her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch . The couple met after being set up by friend Juliet, who gave James her number. They shared their first phone call, which Katie admits was 'nervous and stilted' but they soon started to relax, telling each other about their jobs. The pair arranged to meet up for a drink and a trip to the cinema. 'I figured that if he did turn out to be a starer, at least going to the cinema would keep his eyes elsewhere,' Katie said. 'James was chatty, witty and looked me squarely in the eye. He never once mentioned my burns, and because he didn’t, I didn’t either. 'He didn’t even stare at them, so I didn’t feel self-conscious. He had me relaxed and buzzing with confidence.' Katie, pictured at the TV Choice Awards in September, left, and at the Pride of Britain Awards in October, right . The couple soon started dating and became official before finding out they were expecting a baby in March, this year. Katie was just 24 when her ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch organised for a man to throw industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face. At the time, her modelling career was taking off and she had recently been crowned Miss Winchester in a beauty pageant. She had also begun presenting on small digital television channels, primarily shopping channels, and decided to leave her parents' home in Hampshire for the capital. It was here she met Lynch - a martial arts enthusiast - who had been tracking her media and modelling career closely. In October, the acid attack survivor was awarded an honorary degree at Anglia Ruskin University, in Chelmsford, Essex (left) and right pictured earlier this year . He approached her on Facebook and the pair decided to meet up in person in Reading, where Katie was working at the time. But two weeks into the relationship, the couple booked into a hotel in Bayswater following a meal out, where Lynch raped, beat her and stabbed her several times in the arms. After eight hours in the hotel they drove back to her flat in Golders Green and she later sought medical treatment, though she was too scared to tell doctors what had really happened. Two days later, he persuaded her to go into an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account, where outside her flat she was approached by a man in a hoodie. She thought the man - Stefan Sylvestre, who Lynch hired to carry out the attack - was going to ask for money but instead he threw the liquid in her face. Katie, pictured before the attack left, and right during her recovery after she had acid thrown in her face . Katie has gone on to present television programmes, while her ex Danny Lynch has been jailed for 12 years . Writing in the Daily Mail after the attack, she said: 'When the large cupful of acid hit my smooth, soft, line-free skin, trickling down my throat and partially blinding me, he almost succeeded in extinguishing the last of the old Katie. Almost. 'In the aftermath, I was horrified by my own reflection, barely recognising the image of myself in the mirror. I would play back memories of all the relationships I’d ever had, trying to ingrain in my mind what it felt like to hold hands, to kiss. 'I was sure I’d never be attractive to anyone again, never be intimate. Never be loved.' The attack was caught on CCTV and both Lynch and Sylvestre were arrested and given two life sentences - Lynch will serve a minimum of 12 years. She has since endured more than 100 operations to rebuild her face and set up the Katie Piper Foundation to raise awareness of the issues facing burns victims. Katie has also taken part in a number of documentaries and written her autobiography.","Katie Piper made her 'exciting' announcement this morning on Twitter .

"Cyprus Airways has reportedly flown its fleet of planes to a remote Welsh airfield in a bid to prevent them being seized over a row about paying back 65 million euros (£51million) in illegal state funding. The struggling airline flew its Airbus A320s to a 'secret storage location' in the UK after completing its last flights on Friday. But an online tracking website has shown the planes are at St Athan airfield on the outskirts of Cardiff. Cyprus Airways shut down services after a ruling that it repays state aid amounting to £51million . The move follows a European Commission ruling demanding the airline pay back the state aid it received. Aviation expert Julian Bray said: 'The aircraft if allowed to continue operation, possibly landing at commercial airports could be seized by court officers acting on behalf of creditors. That is why they have been flown to the UK.' EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Cyprus Airways had no chance of becoming viable without continued state subsidies, which means money paid out in 2012 and 2013 as part of a restructuring package would have to be recovered. The restructuring plan was 'based on unrealistic assumptions' the EU Commission claimed. The airline has reportedly hidden its fleet of Airbus A320s at an airfield in Wales . Under EU rules a company can only receive state assistance once every 10 years, and the airline had already been bailed out in 2007. 'The company has ceased being a viable entity... and cannot continue to operate,' Finance Minister Harris Georgiades told a news conference. He said the state would fully cover the cost of alternative flights for passengers who had already booked with the airline. Cyprus Airways is 93 per cent owned by the state and employs 550 people. It has a 10 per cent share of flights to the island, down from 30 per cent two years ago. Workers demonstrated against the ruling outside the Finance Ministry in Cyprus after the airline suspended its operations . St Athan airfield is owned by the Ministry of Defence and was once the UK's largest Royal Air Force station. In December, the RAF was due to hand over operational control of the airfield to private contractors Serco in a move towards converting St Athan into a civilian airfield by 2019. Situated less than three miles from Cardiff Airport it has a variety of hangar facilities and forms part of the St-Athan-Cardiff Enterprise Zone, offering an aerospace base for companies and airlines to use. Ryanair, which announced dozens of new routes within hours of the collapse of Hungary's Malev in 2012, said in a statement that it was temporarily cutting prices to the Mediterranean island to help stranded passengers. The airfield at St Athan, on the outskirts of Cardiff, is reportedly where the planes are being stored . But Ryanair has relatively little spare capacity due to expansion planned for the summer. Quickly covering the flights would also be complicated by the fact that about a third of Cyprus Airways' destinations are outside of the European Union and its routes are longer than Ryanair's average. The demise of the carrier is another blow to Cyprus, which was subjected to harsh bailout conditions in 2013 when it was saved from the brink of bankruptcy by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU. A small number of demonstrators gathered outside Cyprus Airways' Nicosia offices on Friday evening, but the reaction from staff was muted. 'It's pretty clear from the decision that the government didn't put a viable restructuring plan in place. Our union clearly says that was deliberate; you can turn any company around,' said Petros Souppouris, head of the carrier's pilots union. Both Ryanair and Greece's Aegean Airlines, have submitted applications to Cypriot authorities to create subsidiaries on the island.","Airline ceased operations after European Commission ruling .

"A man and woman who met when they were serving as a ring bearer and a flower girl in a wedding have married – 20 years after their first trip down the aisle as children. Briggs Fussy and Brittney Husbyn, of Mankato, Minnesota, married in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, on January 10, five years after being reunited in a college class. 'She turned around one day in class and said ""I think I have a picture of you on my wall at home,""' Briggs, now 22, told Fox 9. Here comes the bride: Briggs Fussy and Brittney Husbyn married in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, on January 10, five years after the couple reconnected in a college class . Flashback: The couple first met in 1995 while serving as a ring bearer and flower girl in a wedding . 'It's funny how God's plan came into place. I didn't even know her before she turned around in class and told me that.' Briggs and Brittney, who are students at Minnesota State University, Mankato, also shared what they remember of the wedding that first brought them together. 'I’m standing up there straight, and Brittney’s running around, making commotion,' Briggs said, adding that he recalls 'little glimpses' of the day that their respective relatives wed in 1995. Kiss the bride: The couple began dating five years ago, after Brittney recognized Briggs from a wedding photo and approached him in class . Fond memory: 'It's fun to have something special like that to look back on,' Brittney said of the 1995 wedding . Child's play: 'I’m standing up there straight, and Brittney’s running around, making commotion,' Briggs recalled of the wedding that first brought them together . It turned out that it wasn't just Brittney's family who had kept photos of the nuptials two decades later. 'It was funny, the first time I ever went over to his house his mom whipped a picture off her wall and said ""I've had a picture of you up in my house forever,""' said Brittney, who describes herself as the 'sappiest human ever'. 'It's fun to have something special like that to look back on,' she added. Happy couple: While their fairytale story prompted guests to wonder whether the flower girl and ring bearer in their wedding might one day tie the knot, Briggs said they're both Brittney's cousins . Briggs' father, Scott Fussy, observed: 'If crazy equals love, they won't have any problem because they're both a little crazy.' After Briggs and Brittney wrap up their remaining college classes, they plan to take a Caribbean honeymoon. While the couple's fairytale romance likely prompted guests to wonder whether the flower girl and ring bearer in their wedding might one day tie the knot, Briggs said that's not the case - as they're both Brittney's cousins. 'They're related, so it's not going to be the same story,' he said.","Briggs Fussy and Brittney Husbyn married in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, on January 10, five years after the couple reconnected in a college class .

"Police are investigating claims that deer are being illegally poached and decapitated in order to trade their heads for drugs. Farmers in the Gippsland area of south-eastern Victoria, have reportedly discovered piles of headless deer on their properties after smelling their decayed cadavers. Police authorities confirmed that the presence of the dead deer on farmland was linked to crime activity by an organised gang who exploited the  animals as a way to fund methamphetamine addiction. Farmers in the Gippsland area of south-eastern Victoria, have reportedly discovered piles of headless deer on their properties . 'These groups have been conveying the heads to Melbourne with an aim to either swap them for drugs or exchange for money to buy drugs,' said Benalla Detective Sergeant and Agricultural Liaison Officer Shannon Murphy. It is believed that the deer heads are being traded for drugs or sold for cash to buy drugs, with the heads fetching up to $300, Detective Sergeant Murphy told The Age. 'I wouldn't say it surprises me, we've got some good local hunters who have utilised their skills to support their criminal activities in the only way they can,' he said. Detective Sergeant Murphy said that the organised gang had been using lookouts, along with  encrypted two-way radios in order to capture and slaughter the animals. Authorities said that the gang had also been using spotlights on the deer, a species known as Samba, which freeze in the light. Police in Mansfield, Benalla and Wangaratta confirmed that at least six people have been charged with illegal hunting offences related to the decapitating of the animals. The deer heads are reportedly being traded for drugs or sold for cash to buy drugs, with the heads fetching up to $300 . Police in Mansfield, Benalla and Wangaratta confirmed that at least six people have been charged with illegal hunting offences . In the past 18 months the incidents have increased, with Game Management Authority officers reporting that up to ten reports had been recorded in the space of one night. Col Brumbley, Victorian State President for the Australian Deer Association, said that he had never heard of something like this before. 'The ADA completely condemns this kind of behaviour. It's this element of people who taint it for the rest of us,' said Mr Brumbley. 'The whole thing is deplorable. The minority of people who want to behave badly should have the full force of the law come down on them,' he said. 'Everyone from the organisation would have an issue with this. Farmers might have a poacher come in and accidentally shoot stock at night instead of deer, which gives us a bad reputation.' A farmer from Alexandra, in the Goulburn River region of Victoria, said that he had heard shotguns in the night and had found the headless cadavers of deer both on his property and near the road, reported The Age. 'To me, they (these illegal hunters) are no better than dogs that see a rabbit and kill it just to kill something,' he said. Police authorities confirmed that the presence of the dead deer on farmland was linked to crime activity by an organised gang who exploited the animals as a way to fund methamphetamine addiction . The headless deer have been found on properties in the Gippsland region of Victoria . The farmer said that there was an added danger of using high-powered rifles on farm land, as the guns could shoot houses from a thousand metres away. 'There is a bit of an ego thing for some people with killing deer with large antlers,' said Mr Brumbley. Between 2013 and 2014 approximately 50,000 deer were killed by hunters with licences, with a majority being the Sambar deer, a breed known for their large antlers. Police are continuing to operate patrols in the area and were fitting cameras to further their investigation, reported The Age. The ADA boasts nearly 6,000 members and takes an ethical stance on the organisations approach to deer hunting. 'We are good people. Hunting is a massive industry and I don't think we get the attention we deserve, and it's a shame that something like this draws attention to the minority,' said Mr Brumbley. 'We're not a bunch of yahoos running around with guns, doing the wrong thing,' said Mr Brumbley. 'This kind of behaviour makes us look like a bunch of rednecks, but most of us are educated beyond secondary school. What we do is a legitimate sport and we are just trying to do the right thing,' he said. It is believed that the heads are being sold without taxidermy, with Mr Brumbley estimating that taxidermy for deer heads would cost up to $600.","Victorian Police have launched investigation into headless deer found on farm properties around the Gippsland region .
They allege that an organised crime gang is decapitating the animals and selling their heads to fuel their methamphetamine addiction .

"Amid somber memorials to mark the fifth anniversary of Haiti's devastating earthquake, the remarkable survival story of five-year-old Jenny Alexis has emerged. The little girl was dug out from the rubble of a collapsed home in January 2010 after four days alone following the natural disaster. The four-month-old teetered on the brink of death for days with dehydration so extreme her veins had collapsed. No one knew her name and her parents were presumed dead after she had been found lying next to the body of a woman. Scroll down for video . Jenny Alexis, is now a bubbly five-year-old who loves princesses and lives with her parents and baby sister in Miami, Florida. Five years ago, she was dug from the rubble after four days in earthquake-stricken Haiti . The little girl was dug from the rubble of a collapsed home in Haiti after four days when she was just four months old during the natural disaster in 2010 . Doctors managed to evacuate her from Haiti for much needed surgery in Miami by flagging down a UN truck and convincing the aid workers to get her on a flight, CNN reported. Five years on from the disaster, which killed at least 300,000 people, the pre-schooler is thriving in her new home in Miami, Florida after she was miraculously reunited with her parents, who both survived. CNN medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, visited Jenny and her family this week. Cohen had watched doctors with Project Medishare battle to save the baby girl in a medics' tent in Haiti which was overwhelmed with the dying and seriously injured and had scarce supplies. Jenny spoke of her love of princesses, posed with sunglasses and wrote her name during the visit. Jenny's mother, Nadine Devilme, has since had another baby, a 17-month-old girl called Naima. Ms Devilme, along with Jenny's father Junior Alexis, were reunited with her in Florida months after the earthquake. The woman that the baby girl had been found lying next to was her babysitter. Doctors with Project Medishare work on the baby girl in Haiti in 2010 after she suffered from such extreme dehydration that her veins collapsed . The baby girl was found in the rubble of this home, four days after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit Haiti . Ms Devilme told CNN that the couple had explained to Jenny that the scars on her arm came from the earthquake in Haiti and that Jesus had saved her. Somber Haitians gathered early on Monday to remember the devastating January 2010 earthquake that left much of the capital and surrounding area in ruins in one of the worst natural disasters of modern times. Hundreds of people, most of the men in dark suits and the women in white dresses, attended a Catholic Mass just after dawn at a new church built alongside the ruined National Cathedral in downtown Port-au-Prince. 'This is the anniversary of the day I can never forget,' Gladys Lambard, who lost her husband and sister in the 7.0-magnitude earthquake, said as she walked into the church arm-in-arm with her 14-year-old daughter. 'The sadness of that day marked me forever.' President Michel Martelly and other dignitaries were presiding over a ceremony at a mass grave on the northern outskirts of the capital where authorities quickly buried thousands of people in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Miraculous: Baby Jenny was reunited with her parents, Nadine Devilme and Junior Alexis, in Miami months after she was saved from the Haiti earthquake . The earthquake struck just before 5pm, collapsing poorly-constructed concrete buildings by the tens of thousands in a densely-populated city. The government later said more than 300,000 people were killed but the exact toll is unknown because there was no systematic effort to count bodies amid the chaos and destruction. Following the earthquake, teams poured in from around the world to try to rescue people trapped in rubble and treat vast numbers of people wounded in the disaster. Carine Joiceus, a 44-year-old customs agency worker who attended the memorial Mass, had to have her arm amputated. She has since had two children and says she has learned to live with her injury. 'I remember just crying the first year after it happened,' Joiceus said. 'But since then, I'm moving ahead with my life and thinking of the future. ' For the country as a whole, the recovery has been uneven. The United Nations says Haiti has received more than 80 per cent of about $12.45 billion pledged by more than 50 countries and multilateral agencies since the disaster, a combination of humanitarian assistance, recovery aid and disaster relief. The capital is awash in new construction and the number of people in the cramped shantytowns and tent camps has dropped from around 1.5 million after the quake to around 80,000. But Haiti also remains a desperately poor country facing many of the same challenges as before the earthquake. The World Banks says more than 6 million out of roughly 10.4 million inhabitants live under the national poverty line of $2.44 per day. Meanwhile, a political standoff between Martelly and parliament that has delayed legislative elections threatens to undermine the country's political stability. Haitian President Michel Martelly speaks during an event at a memorial built in memory of the tens of thousands killed and buried in the mass grave at Titanyen during a service to remember the five year anniversary of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hitting in 2010 .","Jenny Alexis was dug from the rubble of a collapsed house in Haiti during the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in 2010 .

"A grandmother has been jailed for 25 years over the death of her three-year-old grandson who was suffocated to death using six blankets in a twisted punishment called The Wrap. Michael McMullen was 'tied like a mummy' with his arms pinned to his side and loose ends of fabric wrapped over his head for four hours - while he was eating a peanut butter sandwich - after displaying 'behavioral issues'. His grandmother Gale Watkins, 57, told the court in Fort Myers, Florida, she checked on the boy once, pleading with him to stop crying so she could get 20 minutes' rest. At one point she tried to untie the knots but she gave up after breaking a nail. Her friend then tightened the loose ends and put more pillows around him. Michael was found unconscious hours later, face down and 'soaking wet' with sweat. He died of suffocation, overheating and choking on the sandwich. Horrific: Gale Watkins, 57, (right) has been jailed for 25 years for the death of her grandson Michael McMullen (left) who was wrapped in six blankets and left for four hours until he died of suffocation and overheating . On Monday, Watkins became the third and final defendant to be convicted of aggravated manslaughter in the case, handing her a 25-year sentence with five years' probation. The jury took just 30 minutes to pass their verdict. Family friend Donella Trainor, 46, was jailed for 20 years and the boy's stepfather, Douglas Garrigus, 22, for 10 years for the same charge. 'The loss of Michael is the greatest I've ever felt,' Watkins told the court, according to Naples News. 'No one feels more remorse than I do.' Cruelty: The three-year-old boy cried and hyperventilated. At one point his grandmother tried to untie him but gave up after breaking a nail . Her daughter, Michael's mother, Samantha McMullen said she was distraught at losing both her son and her mother. 'My mom couldn’t even hurt a fly let alone a child or a person,' McMullen said. Trainor, a friend of the boy's grandmother, told investigators she had disciplined her own grandchildren that way, using a technique all three adults knew as 'the wrap,' Lieutenant Larry King said. King said the group pinned the boy's arms to his side and rolled him in a king-sized blanket. 'There were six layers of cloth over this child. The loose ends would be folded over his head and feet and tied into a knot, all in an effort to prevent the child from moving,' King said. 'You could use a mummy reference.' The boy, Michael Lee McMullen, screamed and pleaded to be released as he was wrapped and put in his crib for a nap in October 2013, the sheriff's report said. The boy's grandmother, and his stepfather, Garrigus, checked on him at . different times as he cried and struggled, the report said. At one point, Garrigus said he could hear the boy crying and hyperventilating, the sheriff's office said. Trainor returned, found the knot loose and retied it, then put pillows around the child, the report said. She later found him unresponsive and soaked in sweat, it said. Paramedics took him to a hospital in Fort Myers on Florida's southwest coast where he was declared dead, and the medical examiner classified the death as a homicide. Family friend Donella Trainor (left) was jailed for 20 years and stepfather Douglas Garrigus (right) for 10 . Trainor, Watkins and Garrigus were charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child. Trainor, 46, was also charged with aggravated child abuse 'for the torture and unlawful caging' of the boy, King said . Watkins had custody of her grandson because the child's mother had been involved in domestic violence, and Trainor was helping her care for him, King said.","Michael McMullen was wrapped in blankets after refusing to have a nap .

"Two passengers aboard a flight in China have been jailed after opening the plane’s emergency exit doors in protest at a lengthy delay. China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036 travelling from Chengdu to Beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45am on Saturday morning because of snow when crew began to de-ice the plane at the Kunming airport. Passengers were initially told the flight, scheduled to take off at 8.45pm, was being delayed until 11pm. However, the plane was only cleared for take-off around 3.17am, according to local news sources. The plane was taxiing on the runway when a man named  reportedly opened three emergency exits . Two passengers aboard a Chinese Eastern Airlines flight in China have been jailed after opening the emergency exit doors in protest at a lengthy delay . Passengers were said to have become angry when the plane's ventilation system was turned off for 30 minutes during de-icing work to prevent fumes from entering the cabin. Although the co-pilot had been dispatched to explain, passengers remained irate even after the plane left the gate and members of a tour group started arguing with the crew, according to police. The plane was taxiing on the runway when a man named as Mr Zhou reportedly opened three emergency exits to prevent the plane from taking off and forcing it to return to the gate. According to state broadcaster China Central Television, a total of 25 passengers out of the 153 onboard — all part of a single tour group — were held for questioning while the rest continued on to Beijing aboard a separate flight. The plane was taxiing on the runway when a man named as Mr Zhou reportedly opened three emergency exits to prevent the plane from taking off and forcing it to return to the gate . Kunming police said in an online statement that Mr Zhou and a tour guide named Li have been placed under 15-day ‘administrative detention’ for opening the doors. An investigation has been launched and the names of all those found to have been involved would be placed on a ‘national uncivilised traveller record’, administration spokesman Zhang Jilin said in a statement. Names can remain on such lists for up to 18 months, during which travel agencies can decide whether or not to accept them on trips. China's fast growing air travel market is the world's second biggest, but heavy traffic and tight military control of airspace have given it the world's worst record for flight delays. Kunming police said in an online statement that Mr Zhou and a tour guide named Li have been placed under 15-day ‘administrative detention’ for opening the doors . China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036 travelling from Chengdu to Beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45am on Saturday morning because of snow . Cancellations, delays and service complaints spark frequent incidents of air rage at airports and aboard flights, including those to and from foreign destinations. Brawls between passengers and attacks on crew are often filmed and posted online. Saturday's incident was the latest in a growing number of air rage cases involving Chinese travellers. Last month, a China-bound Thai AirAsia flight was forced to return to Bangkok after a female Chinese passenger threw hot water on a flight attendant amid a heated argument between her boyfriend and the cabin crew over service. The plane's ventilation system had been turned off for 30 minutes during de-icing work to prevent fumes from entering the cabin . Also in December, a brawl involving three women erupted on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong yesterday when two of them complained to a mother that her baby was making too much noise. Days later, a passenger on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu yanked open a door shortly before take-off to ‘get some fresh air’. Last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning Chinese travellers into ‘civilized tourists’.","China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036 travelling from Chengdu to Beijing .

"It has been revealed that under existing restrictions on free speech satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo could not be printed in Australia. After the massacre at its offices in Paris where 12 people were killed, the publication's cartoons overnight became a symbol of Western liberties worldwide. However, Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson told The Australian the restrictions contained in 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act would 'ensure it would be shut down' in Australia. Masses of demonstrators made their way on Sunday from 'Place de la Republique' to 'Place de la Nation' in the Unity Rally in Paris . Mr Wilson blasted those against proposed changes to the 18c Act, who are now suddenly embracing free speech, and warned that words needed to be backed up by definite action. If this did not happen it would clearly be hypocritical, he argued. 'The Charlie Hebdo attack is a wake-up call for a lot of people who rhetorically support free speech but when it comes to the nub would choose political advantage over sensible reform,' he said. 'This is where they have the opportunity to rise to the challenge, like the leaders of Europe are now doing, rather than being held out as hypocrites.' Over one million people converged in central Paris for the Unity March to show solidarity with the 17 victims of the terrorist attacks . Large pencils with 'JE SUIS CHARLIE' printed on them were carried during Sunday's march to commemorate the 12 people that were killed at the Charlie Hebdo offices . Although many of the religious-themed cartoons used in the likes of Charlie Hebdo would not contravene the discrimination act, Mr Wilson said that racial stereotyping of Jews and other ethnic groups would create too many legal issues for such a publication to continue in an Australian context. '18c only covers issues of race and ethnic origin, which would cover some of the material but not all of it,' he told The Australian. 'It would cover Jews and ethnic representations, but it wouldn't cover Muslims and other bits. 'In the end, the legal problems would essentially ensure it would be shut down.' People lit candles during a rally outside the French embassy on Sunday in Tel-Aviv, Israel . Mr Wilson believed that there were 'lots of different avenues for reform', but that there were more issues than 'just 18c to be considered'. On Sunday more than three million people have taken part in unity marches across France after 17 people died during three days of deadly attacks in Paris. Up to 1.6m are estimated to have taken to the streets of the French capital. About 2,000 police officers and 1,350 soldiers - including elite marksmen on rooftops - were deployed in the capital to protect participants. Marchers chanted 'liberte' ('freedom') and 'Charlie', in reference to the Charlie Hebdo magazine. Many thousands of others waved French flags, cheered, and sang the national anthem. Up to 1.6 million are estimated to have taken to the streets of the French capital on Sunday .","Under existing restrictions on free speech satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo could not be printed in Australia .

"'Security risk': Alanna Panas, 24, was thrown out of a Maryland casino for breastfeeding her daughter . A 24-year-old mother has claimed she was kicked out of a casino for breastfeeding her seven-week-old daughter in the lobby. Alanna Panas says she was thrown out by security at the Casino at Ocean Down in Berlin, Maryland, who told her she and daughter Lilly were a 'security risk'. Ms Panas says she had intended to feed her daughter in her car but did not have time to get the keys and as it was a cold, rainy January evening, the casino lobby was her only choice. Ms Panas, a mother-of-one from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, had been staying with her family at their beach home in Ocean City for the weekend, and has just visited the casino with her boyfriend. Her mother has been caring for Lilly while she was in the casino, but as the baby had gotten hungry, Ms Panas had left the casino floor to tend to her. 'It wasn't until my mom had left and I was standing in the lobby with Lilly that I realized I didn't have my car keys,' Panas told USA Today. The 24-year-old texted her boyfriend to leave the casino floor and come to the lobby with the keys, but as her baby was crying she began breast feeding in the lobby. According to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's website, 'a mother may breastfeed her child in any public or private location in which the mother and child are authorized to be.' She then claims she was approached by casino security and asked to leave the building because Lilly was under 21. 'They told me that Lilly was a security threat. 'But I didn't have my baby on the casino floor. Lilly and I were in the corner of the lobby.' Ms Panas explains further in a post on her Facebook page: 'I did what was best and began to breastfeed, the perfect nourishment for an infant. 'It was then that I was approached and told to leave immediately. I kindly reminded the security guard that Lilly was 7 weeks old and it was freezing cold and raining, I was not willing to leave and risk her health. 'I was still told I needed to leave with no where else to go but the cold and rain and was labelled as a situation. The Casino at Ocean Down in Berlin, Maryland, claimed they had asked Ms Panas to leave as they saw her and seven-week-old Lilly as a threat of sneaking onto the casino floor . A frustrated Ms Panas posted her story on the casino's Facebook page after which it gained support from breastfeeding support groups and went viral. Casino at Ocean Downs has apologised on social media, saying that it 'strives to make our guests' experiences enjoyable, and if any member of our team acted in a manner that did not promote that experience, we apologize.' However, Ms Panas says that the casino is not sincere in its apology. '[After the incident] I did receive a phone call from the Assistant Executive Director in which I was told I had been told to leave immediately because security saw Lilly and I as a threat of sneaking in. 'They denied it was due to breastfeeding. I was told they do permit children on the property and in the lobby since they do have family friendly events. However, since I was a ""threat"" they reserve the right to expand the gaming floor boundaries to wherever they please. 'I was never formally apologized to for how Lilly and I were treated.'","Woman kicked out of Maryland casino for breastfeeding in the lobby .

"A 22-year-old man tried to use his own five-month-old son as a human shield in a police shootout, officers said. Joseph Gonzales emptied his handgun into the windshield of a patrol car and sped around San Pedro, California, with his baby in the back seat in a deadly chase early Saturday morning, according to detectives. Officers from Long Beach Police Department were called to a domestic dispute at the suspect's home while he was out with the child around 3am. 'Human shield': Joseph Gonzales allegedly threatened to use his five-month-old child, pictured above, as a human . 'Shootout': Officer told how Gonzales exchanged several rounds of fire with officers. The above handgun was found in his car . Shots fired: Gonzales allegedly unloaded his handgun into the windshield of this patrol car. He has been booked for attempted murder, among other felonies . He was on his way back at the time, and reportedly called ahead threatening to shoot members of his own family, as well as police officers when he got back, Fox Los Angeles reported. A police spokesman said: 'He specifically stated he would harm the baby and use him as a shield against police.' He then allegedly pulled up in his SUV, opened fire, then fled with his son still in the car. Gonzales then drove from Long Beach to San Pedro - around 15 miles - before police said he exchanged more rounds of gunfire with officers.

"Execution: Death row inmate, Perry Austin, 55, (photographed)  asked an appeals court to drop all of his appeals and set an execution date as soon as possible . A Texas prisoner on death row for killing a 9-year-old boy more than 20 years ago is asking an appeals court to drop all of his appeals and execute him as soon as possible. Inmate Perry Austin, 55, wrote to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September making the request, KHOU reports, but he has yet to receive a yes or no. In 2001, Austin confessed to the 1992 murder of 9-year-old David Kazmouz. Austin was already serving a 50-year sentence for sexual assault of a child and stabbing an inmate when he confessed, according to the Houston Chronicle. In 1992, Austin had been out on parole for about a year for a 1978 rape, attempted rape, and aggravated robbery. The victims were his family members. Austin was living in Houston and working for a local street gang as a drug courier, the Chronicle reports. That is where he met young Kazmouz's brother Karrem Kazmouz, who was 16 at the time. Austin thought Karrem had stolen from him. So, in an act of revenge, Austin abducted 9-year-old David on Aug. 19 and allegedly injected him with Demerol -- a narcotic pain reliever similar to morphine -- and slit the boy's throat from ear to ear, according to the Chronicle. Eight month's later, authorities found the boy's remains in a landfill. Initially, Austin was a suspect in the boy's disappearance when he was reported missing, but there was not enough evidence to link him to the crime, the Chronicle reports. Instead, Austin was arrested and sentenced to 30 years in prison when the investigation into Kazmouz's death led authorities to discover that Austin, then 33, was in a romantic relationship with a 14-year-old girl. Murder: Austin abducted 9-year-old David Kazmouz (photographed), injected him with Demerol, slit his throat, and dumped his body in a landfill . When Austin confessed to murdering the boy in 2001, he was placed on death row but received a stay of execution in 2003. But now, the 55-year-old, imprisoned for a slew of crimes ranging from robbery to murder, is asking to be executed. Austin sent the letter to the appeals court in September and received a response Friday, KWTX reports. The appeals court is questioning whether Austin is competent to make the decision to volunteer for execution. They said there is evidence that raises questions about Austin's ability to make the request.","Death row inmate, Perry Austin, asked an appeals court to drop all of his appeals and set an execution date 'as soon as possible'

"The Conservatives have opened up their biggest lead over Labour since 2010 as voters become increasingly optimistic about the economy, according to a new poll. With four months to go until the General Election, the survey by Lord Ashcroft put the Tories on 34 per cent, six points ahead of Labour on 28 per cent – worse than their result under Gordon Brown. A regional breakdown suggested that in England, the Conservatives lead Labour by 37 per cent to 29 per cent, while in Scotland the resurgent SNP is on 48 per cent to Labour’s 24 per cent. The poll also supported others suggesting that Ukip’s position has been slipping in recent months, putting the party down three points on last month with 16 per cent. Scroll down for video . The latest opinion poll from Lord Ashcroft puts the Tories on 34 per cent, ahead of Labour on 28 per cent . The findings were at odds with those of Populus, another pollster, which put Labour five points ahead of the Tories, while a YouGov poll put both on 32 per cent. Meanwhile, as David Cameron put the economy at the heart of the Conservative election campaign, 38 per cent of voters said they were either benefiting from recovery or that the recession did not make them any worse off. There has been an eight-point drop since September in the proportion saying there is no recovery or that they are not feeling the benefits, and a seven-point rise in the total saying they are benefiting or are no worse off. And in a boost to Conservative hopes of a feel-good factor by the time of May’s election, mortgage rates fell to an all-time low and the price of crude oil crashed below $50 a barrel, its lowest since the financial crisis – signalling more likely cuts in petrol prices and energy bills. David Cameron used a speech today to set out six Tory election themes, as Labour leader Ed Miliband took questions in Stevenage . Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The success of the Tories’ economic message relies on people feeling that, at the end of the road to a stronger economy, there will be something in it for them.’ Mr Cameron yesterday said an additional £30billion would need be saved before 2018 so this generation does not pass on a ‘legacy of debt’ to its children. He was speaking ahead of a vote today on a new ‘fiscal charter’, committing the Government to eliminating the current structural deficit. Labour is expected to back the charter, while rejecting the Government’s timetable. Labour and the Conservatives may form a ‘grand coalition’ together after the election, a senior Cabinet minister has claimed. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party should prepare for being pushed out of government, as David Cameron and Ed Miliband could reach an extraordinary deal to share power. One senior Tory said there was ‘not a snowball’s chance in Hell’ of such an agreement with Labour. Meanwhile Mr Miliband refused to rule out a Labour coalition with the Scottish National Party. Chancellor George Osborne said: ‘Labour are in a chaotic position. 'If they vote for the charter and do accept that £30billion consolidation is required, then they are promising a tax bombshell because they accept our spending plans. ‘If they vote for the charter and reject the need for £30billion consolidation, then they are just pretending they don’t want to borrow or spend more when nothing has actually changed. 'They would be offering a grand deceit.’ Mr Cameron, who tried his hand at fixing tiles to a roof mockup in during a visit to J Wright roofing college in Nottingham, sought to cast the general election in May as a choice between security and chaos . The Prime Minister said that if the Conservatives remained in power, £12billion in savings would come from fresh welfare cuts, £13billion from a further squeeze on government spending and £5billion from a further crackdown on tax avoidance. Speaking at a campaign rally in Nottingham, he said the plans were ‘difficult but do-able’ – the equivalent of a family saving £1 in every £100 it spent. He rejected Labour’s warnings that Tory plans would mean returning public services to 1930s levels – saying spending would only be taken back to the level it was under Tony Blair – and challenged Labour to say where it would raise taxes. Mr Cameron also sought to counter Labour attacks over the Tories’ failure to make the NHS one of their six main election themes, announcing that the health service budget would be protected from cuts and increased in real terms if he remains in Downing Street. But Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Unless we have higher wages and living standards, we won’t get the revenue to reduce the deficit. Their plan will keep failing on living standards and therefore keep failing on the deficit.’ Latest polling shows that voters name the economy, health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family, with immigration a key concern for the country . The Ashcroft poll showed 52 per cent of people say Britain is going in the wrong direction, up three points since May last year. The figure is highest amongst Ukip voters (76 per cent) and lowest amongst Tory supporters (13 per cent). Almost a quarter (23 per cent) say the economy is still not recovering from the recession, while just 14 per cent say the economy is recovering from the recession and they are feeling better off as a result.","Ashcroft: Tories 34%, Labour 28%, Ukip 16%, Lib Dems 8%, Greens 8% .

"Guts, veins, brains and hearts have been revealed in gruesome detail using next-generation body scanners. The GE scanners, used by doctors in Florida, are currently involved in their first clinical trial aimed at making the process of medical scanning cheaper and easier.

"Ukip leader blamed Western foreign policy and mass immigration for ‘much of what has happened' Nigel Farage risked sparking fresh outrage today after claiming European governments bore some ‘culpability’ for the Paris massacres. The Ukip leader blamed Western foreign policy and mass immigration for ‘much of what has happened’. His remarks come after he was attacked by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg for claiming there was a ‘fifth column’ in Britain. But speaking in the European Parliament, Mr Farage brushed aside the claims he was ‘seeking to divide’ the country for political points. He told MEPs: ‘We need an honest admission that actually our political decisions have led to much of what has happened. ‘Just think about foreign policy – from Afghanistan through Iraq, through Libya and even the attempt to arm the rebels in Syria. ‘All of these we were told to make our streets safer, when in fact what we have done is stir up real resentments within the Muslim community and it’s had the very opposite effect.’ He added that ‘mass immigration’ had ‘made it frankly impossible for many new communities to integrate’. But Mr Farage said: ‘Perhaps worst of all we have been guilty of weakness – lack of courage – a lack of assertion of who we are as people. ‘We’ve turned a blind eye to many of our minority communities to practises that would not be tolerated in the rest of the population. ‘We’ve allowed preachers of hate to go around saying things that are totally unacceptable. Scroll down for video . ‘The result of all this is we have a fifth column living in our communities that is utterly opposed to our values and how we deal with that is vital for the future. ‘Unless we are prepared to admit our own culpability in much of what has happened we are not going to be able to find solutions. ‘We are going to have to be a lot braver and courageous in standing up for our Judeo Christian culture.’ Members of the European Parliament observed a minute of silence  in Strasbourg for the victims of the Paris attack . Ukip MEPs Patrick O'Flynn (left) and Tim Aker (right place placards reading 'Je Suis Charlie' on their desks . Mr Farage was last week criticised for 'inflaming' tensions after the Muslim Council of Britain insisted there can be no justification for the 'barbaric' attack on the office of a French satirical magazine. Mr Cameron said it was wrong to use the attacks to 'make political remarks or arguments' while Mr Miliband insisted: 'I don't think Nigel Farage or anyone else should be seeking to divide us in this way.' Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg said: 'I am dismayed that Nigel Farage immediately thinks, on the back of the bloody murders that we saw on the streets of Paris yesterday, his first reflex is to make political points.' Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims . He told LBC: 'If this does come down, as it appears to be the case, to two individuals who perverted the cause of Islam to their own bloody ends, let's remember that the greatest antidote to the perversion of that great world religion are law-abiding British Muslims themselves. 'And to immediately ... imply that many, many British Muslims - who I know feel fervently British but also are very proud of their Muslim faith - are somehow part of the problem rather than part of the solution is firmly grabbing the wrong end of the stick.' But Britain’s first elected Muslim Cabinet minister yesterday insisted it was ‘lazy’ to claim Islam had nothing to do with last week’s terror attacks in France. It comes after Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims. Mr Javid also called on British Muslims to do more to tackle extremism – claiming they had a ‘special burden’ because so many of the attacks were carried out by fanatics who claim inspiration from Islam. The former banker, who became the first Muslim Tory MP after being elected in 2010, attacked the ‘barbaric’ terrorists responsible for last week’s atrocities. Mr Javid said: ‘The lazy answer from people out there is to say that this had got nothing whatsoever to do with Islam and Muslims and that should be the end of that part of the debate. ‘That is lazy and that would be wrong. You can’t get away from the fact that these people are using Islam, they are taking a great religion, a peaceful religion of a billion people around the world, taking this religion and using it as their tool to carry out their horrible activities.’ Mr Javid said because of this there was a ‘special burden’ on Muslims to deal with Islamic extremism. He said: ‘All communities can do more to try and help and deal with terrorists, try and help track them down, but I think it is absolutely fair to say that there is a special burden on Muslim communities, because whether we like it or not, these terrorists call themselves Muslims. ‘It is no good for people to say they are not Muslims, that is what they call themselves. They do try to take what is a great peaceful religion and warp it for their own means.’","Ukip leader blamed Western government for ‘much of what has happened’

"Five years ago this week a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Port-Au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, all-but obliterating the city in the process. The tremor, the strongest to hit the island since 1770, killed 300,000, left 1.5million homeless and destroyed 60 per cent of the country's government buildings - including the National Palace. But despite £8.6billion being handed over in donations and foreign aid since the crisis began, much of the country still lies in ruins or is waiting to be rebuilt. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Five years have passed since Port-Au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, was all-but destroyed by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, but as this image of a street shows, little has changed there . Where the Beaux Arts-style National Palace once stood, there is now nothing more than an empty field with a solitary flagpole. The old structure has been cleared away, part of the 19million cubic metres of rubble which was removed after the disaster, but the new building has not been started yet. Elsewhere the city's cathedral is still nothing more than a series of half-demolished walls, just as it appeared in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. Thousands of desperate Haitians arrived in the days following January 12, 2010, to shelter under tarpaulins in the ruins of the holy building. The tent cities became a hotbed of cholera which spread among the ruins of Port-Au-Prince, which was at severe risk from flooding. Destroyed: Almost 1.5million people were left homeless, with many thousands taking refuge in the city's destroyed cathedral. Five years on, some of them are still there (pictured in 2010 above, and today below) While 95 per cent of those people have now been rehoused, the cathedral still lies in ruins, and there is also evidence of people still living up against its walls. In another set of images from a local market, little difference is visible between 2010 and today save that a few splintered power lines have been cleared away. Meanwhile the flattened Twins Market has been cleared away, though little more than a corrugated iron fence stands in its place. One of the few structures to have been fully rebuilt is Iron Market after one of Haiti's biggest employers, DigiCel, stepped forward to provide funding. Flattened: The National Palace was destroyed in the quake, along with 60 per cent of the country's government buildings. Today there is little more than a flagpole to mark where it once stood . The market's old green and red metal frame has been replaced, while the walls surrounding it have also been repaired and traders have returned to sell their wares. However, it is clear that officials who promised in the weeks after the disaster that the city would be 'built back better' have fallen woefully short of their target. Port-Au-Prince, a city in which the vast majority of people lived and worked in poorly-built concrete shanty-towns, was virtually razed to the ground when the earthquake struck in 2010. Eighty per cent of the city's schools were destroyed, the main hospital collapsed, and a quarter of all public servants perished. Even before the disaster, nearly three quarters of the population lived on less than $2 a day, with half having no access to running water or toilets, so after the earthquake the poverty was acute. All gone: This destroyed Twins Market building (pictured above in 2010) has now been cleared, but has been replaced by little more than an iron fence (below) making a mockery of promises to 'build back better' Poor sanitation lead to a cholera outbreak which killed an estimated 9,000 people as parts of the capital descended into a state of anarchy. Donations and relief workers flooded in from around the globe to help with the cleanup. Emergency food needed to be found for 4million people. Among the first projects to get underway were health clinics, schools and a new power plant to allow the city to function once again. However, five years on at least 200,000 people are living in hillside slums around the capital, little more than tin huts without access to running water or electricity. Despite the best efforts of the global community and officials in the impoverished country, there is still a long way to go. Rebuilt: One of the few structures to have been fully restored is the city's Iron Market, which was reconstructed after one of Haiti's largest employers, DigiCel, put forward the money (pictured above in 2010, and today below)","Port-Au-Prince nearly wiped off the map after 7.0 magnitude quake in 2010 .

"Her good looks and dancing talents clearly caught the eye of Prince Harry and now the royal ex's skills have landed her a major modelling job. Cressida Bonas has been snapped up to star in Mulberry's upcoming video.

Cressida will star in a new video by the British label, during which she shows off her  dance skills with a mixture of 'improvised' and rehearsed steps. Speaking about her coup, the blonde thespian told Yahoo Style: 'I think it was just about being free and happy, and having fun. 'The idea was, ""dance as if you're dancing in your kitchen"". It was more about a dance that was improvised, and not all about the steps. It was really just about having fun.' The blonde beauty - who appears in the short film alongside actor Freddie Fox - was cast in the ads after talent spotters at her final dance performance before her graduation from the University of Leeds were 'charmed by her movement which inspired the concept'.

"Apple is putting the finishing touches to its Watch ahead of an expected launch in March - and has released a test version of the software that will link it to an iPhone. The latest release of iOS 8.2, expected to be launched within weeks, includes references to the much anticipated watch. Apple Watch will link via Bluetooth and a special app on user's iPhone. Scroll down for video . The Apple Watch will link to a special app on the user's iPhone via Bluetooth. The Apple Watch will use three types of app. Notifications allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late. Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe. Full apps can use a developer's own interface. 'Inside of the Bluetooth Settings menu is a new panel specifically for pairing an iPhone with the Apple Watch,' said Mark Gurman of 9to5mac. 'Additionally, the instructions inside of the Bluetooth menu specifically indicate that Apple will release a dedicated 'Apple Watch app' for setting up and controlling the wearable device. Apple has previously said the timepiece will be controlled by a special app. Apple Watch users will install an Apple Watch app on their iPhone, which will be used to download apps onto the watch as well as manage Apple Watch settings. A user’s iPhone is also used to help with computational demands,a nd help preserve the watch's battery life. Sources familiar with the product's development say that the device is currently on track to ship in the United States by the end of March, . So far Apple has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released, although a statement made to Apple employees suggests the release will be in 'the spring.' It has previously been claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors. However, breakthroughs have been made in the number of successful yields for the watch's display and processor, according to Taiwan's United Daily News late last year. Now 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman says Apple Store employees are set to be trained in February. 'One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch,' he claims. The Apple Watch will be available in three versions: Watch, Watch Sport, and Watch Edition, a high end version made of specially developed precious metals. 'These training programs will take place between February 9th and February 16th.' The employees will then train the rest of their store's staff, it is believed. Unveiled on September 9 at Apple's iPhone 6 launch event, the Apple Watch is the company's foray into wearable computers. Samsung, LG, Motorola and Microsoft have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its watch. Quanta, which is building the watch, has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000. The initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches. Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches will be shipped during 2015, according to claims - and mass production will start in January . Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015, G for Games said. According to 9to5Mac, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores hinted at the release date when she told staff: 'We're going into the holidays, we'll go into Chinese New Year, and then we've got a new watch launch coming in the spring.' Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. He didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.' Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. A 'source close to Apple' told The Information last month that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Chinese New Year falls on 19 February next year, so Ms Ahrendts comments push it at least beyond this date. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission suggests the watch's battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging . Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would 'charge it at night.' During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch 'can be worn all day, for any occasion,' but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life 'is about a day now.'

A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple's other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will 'motivate people to be more active and more healthy.' Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging. Apple's silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time.","Beta version of iOS 8.2 sent to developers includes watch references .

"The father accused of throwing his five-year-old daughter to her death over a 60-foot bridge has made his second court appearance after a mental health assessment but refused to speak to the judge. John Jonchuk, 25, is charged with first degree murder after a police officer claims to have seen him parking on Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St Petersburg, Florida, before throwing Phoebe Jonchuk into the river. The cop said he heard the girl scream. Today, Jonchuk was brought before a judge and assigned an attorney, but was immediately escorted out after court marshals said he was refusing to speak. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Charged: John Jonchuk appeared in court for the second time over his daughter's death but didn't talk . In custody: John Jonchuk Jr, 25, (left) has been charged with murder after his five-year-old daughter Phoebe (right) was thrown to her death off a 60ft bridge in Tampa Bay . At his first appearance Jonchuk was asked if he had an attorney and he said he was 'leaving it up to God'. Candlelit vigils for Phoebe have stood in St Petersburg since her death last Wednesday. Child protection services have scrambled to overhaul their policies after it emerged they were alerted to John Jonchuk's delusional behavior hours before his alleged attack. It was one of two red flags waved at government agencies on Wednesday that went ignored. An anonymous caller told Florida's Department of Children and Families on Wednesday afternoon they had seen the 25-year-old driving around in his pajamas looking 'delusional and depressed'. But the call 'did not rise to the level of reasonable cause to suspect' according to the DCF's policies and the report was not investigated. Earlier that day, Jonchuk's attorney had called police warning that he was 'acting strangely' during a custody meeting, calling her 'God' and asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. Devastated: Jonchuck's mother and the girl's grandmother Michelle Lynn Jonchuck, has said she never wants to see her son again and claims she wishes it was him who had died on the bridge . Angelic: Tributes have been paid to Phoebe and a memorial set up for her near the bridge where she fell . Officers went to interview Jonchuk outside daughter Phoebe's day care but they found nothing suspicious. Hours later, Jonchuk was allegedly seen driving at 100mph to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and throwing five-year-old Phoebe to her death. She was pulled from the water 40 minutes later but paramedics could not resuscitate the child. The DCF has announced that all warning calls will now be investigated within four hours, and a notice will be issued to law enforcement, Click Orlando reported. DCF Secretary Mike Carroll said: 'The horrible nature of this little girl’s murder at the hands of her father is heart wrenching and demands our most immediate and thorough response.' His statement added: 'We have to do more for the children, like Phoebe, who depend on us to protect them.' On Friday, relatives and friends remained gathered around a memorial site for Phoebe. Jonchuk's mother, Phoebe's grandmother, Michelle Lynn Jonchuk has said her son should have killed himself instead. Speaking to Click Orlando, she also paid tribute to the youngster, saying: 'She always had a smile on her face, she loved to dance and she sung. First hearing: Jonchuk said he wanted to leave himself 'in the hands of God' when asked about representation . Troubled relationship: Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, said Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. She added that he had been diagnosed with bipolar . 'My angel': Paying tribute to Phoebe, Miss Kerr said: 'She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated.' 'I don't forgive him. There is no sense in this. He didn't have to do this to her. I just wish there was one thing God could do was to bring her back.' She added that she was supposed to pick Phoebe up from school on Thursday. The last time she saw her son and daughter together, she said everything was normal. Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, told the station that Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. 'She was my angel, I always called her my angel baby. She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated,' she said. 'He would only let me talk to her on the phone. He wouldn't disclose his location, so I didn't know where to go.' 'He was very, very bipolar,' she told Tampa Bay News. 'He was Jekyll and Hyde all the way.' Among other medication, Miss Kerr says Mr Jonchuk took regular doses of bipolar pills Seroquel and anti-depressives Zoloft. When they met, she added, Mr Jonchuk was her 'gay friend', until he told her he 'liked women too'. Soon after, Phoebe was born. Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records. On the last night she saw Phoebe, Miss Kerr said she and Jonchuck had a nice evening together, but later on he called child protective services and made a false abuse allegations. She added that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and had been admitted to a mental hospital on several occasions. 'He does the Jekyll and Hyde. It's just something that goes on in his head, he just wasn't wired right. 'He's not mentally stable, but he was mentally stable enough to take care of a child for five years, so he knew what he did. He cried, the detective said.' It has since emerged Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. With no fixed abode, the father and daughter have been living with John Jonchuk Sr for two months. But at midnight last night Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report. The officer who spotted the Cruiser gave chase and saw the driver reach the top of Dick Misener Bridge then enter the approach to the Skyway. The car was then seen to stop and a figure emerged, throwing a child over the side of the rail into the water off Boca Ciega Bay. The officer said he heard the girl scream as she fell. Issues: Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records . Scene: Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report . Jonchuk returned to the car and drove south but was stopped by Manatee County authorities about 30 minutes later. He was arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder. Jonchuk also faces charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding police. The girl was found 40 minutes later by divers from Eckerd College and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and her mother was informed. At Jonchuk's first hearing on Thursday, Pinellas County Judge Michael Andrews asked him if he wanted an attorney. 'I want to leave it in the hands of God,' Jonchuck said. Arrested: An officer who claims to have witnessed the incident chased Jonchuk and detained him . Behavior: Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish . Tragic: This is the car seat, recovered from Boca Ciega Bay, in which investigators found the dead child . The judge responded: 'I'm pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial.' Details have since emerged of Jonchuk's 'strange' behavior on Wednesday that prompted his attorney Genevieve Torres to contact police. Torres said she met with John Jonchuck on Wednesday to discuss the custody case for his five-year-old daughter, Phoebe. After their meeting, she was so worried about the father and daughter that she reported the odd statements to police. Officers interviewed Jonchuck and his daughter as he was picking her up from a church day care and both appeared to be in good health. Jonchuck said he didn't want to harm himself or anyone else, the documents said. 'She was smiling and appeared healthy, properly clothed and happy,' according to the documents. A little more than twelve hours later, police said Jonchuck threw his daughter over a bridge.","A caller warned child services John Jonchuk was acting 'delusional'

"Ivanka Trump marked off an important milestone in her daughter's life yesterday when she took the three-year-old ice skating for the first time. The 33-year-old shared a heartwarming picture of herself, her husband Jared Kushner and their young daughter at the Trump Rink on Sunday afternoon on her Instagram account. 'Today was Arabella's first time ice skating,' she wrote alongside the candid snap. 'Such fun! Even Joseph was cheering from the sidelines! a big thank you to the great team at the #TrumpRink in Central Park!' Scroll down for video . Talented trio: Ivanka Trump (R) and her husband Jared Kushner (L) took their three-year-old daughter Arabella for her first ice skating session in Central Park on Sunday . Baking up a storm: Earlier in the week, the three-year-old was busy in the kitchen making a birthday cake for her father, who celebrated his 34th on Saturday . In the picture, both Ivanka and Jared, 34, can be seen offering a supportive arm to Arabella, who is sensibly clad in a warm jacket, rose-colored mittens, colorful fuzzy hat and - most importantly - a protective helmet. And despite it being her first time on the rink, the youngster looks fairly at easy on the ice, happily standing alongside her parents, while her one-year-old brother Joseph watched from the sidelines. It was a busy weekend for the family, who spent Saturday celebrating real estate mogul Jared's 34th birthday. On Friday, Ivanka posted a picture of Arabella in the kitchen, whipping up what was no doubt a delicious birthday cake for her father, while wearing a costume inspired by Disney's hit animated movie Frozen. Alongside the image, Ivanka joked: 'A shockingly small amount of frosting actually made it past Arabella's lips and on to her daddy's birthday cake!' In between all of the family-focused fun however, Ivanka, who has been hard at work filming and promoting the current season of Celebrity Apprentice alongside her famous father Donald, and her husband managed to enjoy a rare night off from their parenting duties in order to celebrate Jared's birthday with a trip to the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club in Brooklyn. The entrepreneur shared a couple of images from their evening out on the town, one of which shows her looking incredibly focused on the game in hand - while dressed casually in a pair of black jeans and a knitted jumper.

'All the women I know, this next generation, they're working hard, not just in a professional capacity but really in all aspects of their life. They're not one dimensional. They're doing things outside of the office and inside of the office and living in this digital age where we really do just live one life 24 hours a day, and I wanted to celebrate that,' she said. 'There isn't this clear compartmentalization that used to exist, where it was work and home. Now it's just one life, and I think that's something really unique to my generation,' she added.

"Rumours about an upcoming Apple 'super' tablet are gaining more traction today after an image was leaked that appeared to be a mould for the device. The photo was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide. It follows a leaked sketch from last week that claimed to show one corner of the so-called megapad, iPad Pro or iPad Air Plus. The photo of the mould (pictured) was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China. Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). The latest image was posted on Chinese social network Weibo. If the rumours are true, the iPad Pro would be significantly larger than the current iPad Air 2. Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). By comparison, the iPad Air 2 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm). Name: Popular suggestions for the name of the supersized tablet include the iPad Air Plus - taking its lead from Apple's iPhone 6 Plus smartphone, and the iPad Pro. Size: The tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 inch screen, although other dimensions have also been suggested. Rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick. Design: The leaked 'sketch' suggests that the iPad Air Plus will be similar in design to the iPad Air 2, with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges. USP: The image differs from the smaller tablet however, because of grilles on the top of the shell, which suggest the device will include stereo speakers, as rumoured. Launch: Sources have suggested different launch times, but there is some consensus that the tablet may make its debut before the summer. The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen. This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's 12.2-inch Galaxy Note Pro, which launched in February. Last week's leaked sketch, also reportedly taken by an employee who works at Foxconn seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound. The image was released by French website Nowhere Else, which has previously leaked details  from unannounced smartphones and Apple gadgets which proved to be true, citing a Foxconn source. The source said that initial testing for the iPad Air Plus was stopped in the summer and Apple’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet. The sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the iPad Air 2 in design, with rounded corners and the same standby button, rear camera, microphone and volume buttons placement. However, seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound, there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell. Japanese magazine Mac Fan claimed in December that the iPad Air Plus will also feature a much faster A9 processor and is set to launch between April and June. By comparison, the iPad Air 2 (pictured) is 9.4 inches x 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240 mm x 169.5 mm x 6.1 mm). Sources have suggested different launch times for the iPad Air Plus, but the general consensus is that the supersized tablet may make its debut before the summer . A leaked photo of a sketch (pictured) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a Foxconn factory, where iPads are made, also suggests that the rumours of an ‘iPad Air Plus’ with a 12.2 inch screen, are true . Bloomberg and other publications reported that Apple was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015, while a recent report from The Wall Street Journal said the Californian firm had postponed mass production of the larger iPad from December 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch. These designs showed the gadget as just 7mm thick, but the size of the screen is uncertain, with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches. The first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the iPhone 6 Plus was impacting on iPad usage. The release of Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus means there is now only a 2.4-inch difference between the size of the phablet’s screen, and the display on its iPad mini. Analysis has revealed that as phones become larger, more people are using them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant. The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen.This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's Galaxy Note Pro, which launched last February (pictured) The iPad Air Plus is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger, dwarfing the iPad Mini with its 7.9inch screen (left) and iPad Air (right) with a 9.7 inch screen . A study by Pocket - an app that lets users save webpages, videos and other content for reading - recently found that people who upgraded to an iPhone 6 Plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before. It analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app, and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an iPhone 5, 5C and 5S and those who now own an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also looked at the use of tablets by the same people. A survey comparing the  before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users revealed that people with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55% of the time, but this increases to 72% for the iPhone 6 and 80% for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad, perhaps explaining why Aple is planning a larger one . Pocket also saw users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 (centre) opened 33% more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5S (left), and those with a 6 Plus (right) opened 65% more items than before . The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent. Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales. Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular. The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘The bigger your phone’s screen, the more time you’ll spend reading and watching on it,’ explained the researchers in a blog post. ‘In fact, the bigger your phone’s screen, the more you’ll read and watch as a whole.’ It discovered that users who upgraded to an iPhone 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time, up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen. Pocket also saw that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. But, a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and Pocket noticed that people with an iPhone 6 Plus read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. ‘This tells us that, at least for now, convenience and portability trump a better, and bigger, entertainment and reading experience.’","Mould photo is said to have been taken at manufacturer Foxconn's factory .

"Ford attempted to land a knock-out blow to its rivals at the Detroit auto show in revealing a dazzling new GT supercar on Monday. The glitzy presentation at the cavernous Joe Louis Arena was an attempt to grab the headlines at the United States' premier auto show, where power and luxury have roared back to the fore. Ford had given very little away in the lead-up to the first major international auto show of the year, but speculation had been rife that it had something special in mind. Scroll down for video . Praise: Car enthusiasts sprang forward to talk up the new Ford GT, unveiled Monday in Detroit, Michigan . Mighty: The sleek new model has 600 horsepower and twin-turbocharged engines . And it did not disappoint, unveiling a new GT model for next year - which that immediately won glowing approval from car enthusiasts. The new GT, an update to the legendary sports car last produced a decade ago before the US industry plunged into crisis, boasts 600 horsepower and twin-turbocharged V6 eco-boost engines. Ford did not reveal the exact pricing at the show, according to autoexpress, but said the it is likely to be similar to the price of the Lamborghini Aventador, which is £260,000 ($390,000). It signals Ford's readiness to put the years of austerity from the 2008-2009 recession behind it, when things like circuit-ready supercars were seen as expensive excesses. Brash: The powerful new car marks a return to confidence after the auto industry was rocked by the financial crisis . Gather round: Journalists and guests at the motor show crowded round the car as soon as it was unveiled . Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive, called the GT a showcase for Ford's most advanced efforts in lightweight materials, power-and-fuel conservation in its engines, and aerodynamics. 'We looked at how we were driving innovation through the company,' Fields said. 'And we said to ourselves, let's have a showcase where we can highlight that innovation and technology in a really dramatic way.' The GT will be available late 2016, Fields said, marking the 50th anniversary of the company's original high-performance racer, the GT40. But Fields was coy when asked if the new GT would be racing at Le Mans or Sebring. 'We have nothing else to talk about besides just presenting this great looking car.' Ford had already been in the spotlight in Detroit, snapping up the award for best truck, for the new aluminum F-150, while the Volkswagen Golf was named North American car of the year. Competition: Mercedes also showed off a concept car at the motor show - the F015, shown above .

"A nine-year-old boy became the youngest person ever to appear before Parliament today – and described it as being ‘like Hogwarts’. Alex Rukin was petitioning a committee of MPs investigating the case for a new high-speed rail link between London, the Midlands and the North. The primary school pupil has claimed the £40billion scheme will ‘ruin my life’ - because it will run past the back of his mother's home, spoiling his night's sleep. Scroll down for video . Alexander Rukin, nine, appeared in Parliament today with his father Joe Rukin, who manages the Stop HS2 campaign . Alex, whose father manages the Stop HS2 campaign, told MPs the new rail line was a 'stupid idea'. The young anti-high speed rail campaigner, who goes to Clinton School, in Kenilworth in Warwickshire, starred in a video last year informing people how to petition against HS2. Alex, who spends half his time in Kenilworth with his father and the remaining time in Balsall Common with his mother, questioned why HS2 was being funded when his school has to ask parents to donate money. Asked about what he thought of his famous surroundings in Westminster where he made history, Alex said: ‘It looks a lot like Hogwarts.’ Hogwarts is a fictional school of witchcraft and wizardry in the Harry Potter series of books. In his petition against HS2 Alex claimed the project’s bosses were ‘cheating on their sums’. He said: ‘People at HS2 Ltd are really, really bad at maths and make things up that aren’t true, your petitioner is worried that HS2 will cost lots more than the people are saying. ‘Your petitioner has been told that saying things which are not true is naughty, so does not understand why the HS2 people say things that are not true and get given lots of money.’ Alexander Rukin, nine - with his toy named Ellie - became the youngest person to address Parliament today . Alex’s father, and Stop HS2 Campaign manager, Joe Rukin (right) said his son was the 'youngest person to have ever appeared in an official capacity before parliament' Alex’s father, and Stop HS2 Campaign manager, Joe Rukin said: ‘As far as we can tell Alex will become the youngest person to have ever appeared in an official capacity before parliament. This makes sense to me, as apart from the specific instance of Hybrid Bill committees, I can’t think of any case when someone that young would have the opportunity, apart from maybe Edward VI. ‘After I explained what petitioning was, he said he thought everyone in the whole country should be doing it, He is committed to doing something about something he thinks is wrong, and I’m really proud about that.’","Alex Rukin appeared before MPs probing case for new high-speed rail link .

"Britain's two biggest airports were busier than ever in 2014. Heathrow passenger numbers last year rose 1.4 per cent to a record 73.4 million, while a total of 38.1 million were handled at Gatwick - a 7.6 per cent increase on 2013 and another all-time high. The Heathrow numbers were boosted by a record final month of the year which saw nearly six million passengers pass through the west London airport, which was a rise of 2.4 per cent on the December 2013 figure. Heathrow Airport passenger numbers were up for 2014 - to a whopping 73.4million, an all-time high . Gatwick's December figure of 2.58 million was 8 per cent up on the same month in 2013. And when it comes to most popular destinations, Latin America has seen a spike in interest. Heathrow's full-year total included a 6.3 per cent rise in Latin America traffic, with East Asia up 5.2 per cent and Middle East and Central Asia up 3.5 per cent. In December alone, Heathrow saw over 6 million passengers come through - a 2.4% increase on 2013 . Among the most popular destinations, Latin America saw a 6.3% rise in traffic. Pictured: Rio de Janeiro . At Gatwick, there was a 2.8 per cent growth in North America traffic, while other long-haul destinations grew 12.1 per cent. Bosses of both airports seized on the figures to support their case for being recommended by the Government-appointed Airports Commission this summer to be the site of a new runway. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: 'Only by expanding Heathrow can we add direct flights to the world's growing cities, increase our exports and connect all of the UK to global growth. 'Expanding Heathrow will help Britain win the race for growth.' Not to be outdone, Gatwick also had a record-breaking year, serving 38.1million passengers . Gatwick chief financial officer Nick Dunn said: 'Our record-breaking figures show an airport serving the widest range of travel and airline models - exactly what is needed from the decision about the UK's next runway.' London's third-busiest airport - Stansted in Essex - also had a good 2014, with passenger numbers rising 12 per cent to more than 19.9 million. This was Stansted's best year since 2008 and was rounded off by December 2014 passenger levels of more than 1.5 million, an 18.5 per cent increase on the December 2013 figure.","Heathrow passenger numbers rose 1.4% in 2014, reaching a record high .

"New pictures showing the inside of Charlie Hebdo's offices moments after terrorist gunmen stormed in and murdered the magazine's senior staff have emerged today. One desk is covered with the day's work - papers, water bottles, and a coffee mug - while underneath the swivel chair a large pool of blood has settled on the laminate wood flooring. A bag, packed full of what appears to be artist's drawings, sits next to it on the floor while notes are tacked to the surrounding walls. Tragic: A desk is still covered with the day's work, along with empty water bottles and a coffee mug, inside the offices of Charlie Hebdo - while underneath the chair there is a pool of blood . Investigators: This is the moment police first moved into the building in the Le Marais district of Paris after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed the senior staff on Wednesday last week . Bloodied footprints are visible leading away from the chair and in to the next room, as a pair of blue latex forensic gloves lie abandoned on the floor. Another image shows the moment forensic investigators moved into the building following the massacre which happened at around 10.30am on Wednesday morning. The magazine, and  its editor Stephane Charbonnier, known as Charb, was targeted for repeatedly printing cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. He was killed in the attack, along with some of France's most experienced and revered cartoonists, along with journalists and columnists, including Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac, Georges Wolinski, Jean 'Cabu' Cabut, Philippe Honore, Bernard Maris, Elsa Cayat, Mustapha Ourrad and Michel Renaud. Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, were responsible for the bloody assault, and died three days later after being cornered in a print works to the north of Paris by armed officers. The first picture to show the inside the offices of the satirical magazine, likened by many to Private Eye, emerged over the weekend. That images shows a corridor covered with yet more bloody footprints and crumpled papers stuck to the floor boards after those who had been working on them just hours before were killed. Like countless other offices, notes and cards adorn a corridor wall. But here, police tape has also been attached to a door. Massacre: This image, released last week, shows a corridor in Charlie Hebdo's offices covered with bloodied footprints and crumpled papers, while other sketches and notes are still pinned to the walls . Six of the Charlie Hebdo staff killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac . One of the cartoons on the wall appears to be the sketch for the controversial ‘Sharia Hebdo’ front page, which sparked the previous terrorist attack in November 2011. The firebomb – which destroyed the magazine’s computer system but failed to injure anyone – came after the publication ran an issue supposedly guest-edited by Mohammed, containing cartoons of the Muslim prophet and the slogan: ‘100 lashes if you don’t die of laughter’. The tragic scenes from inside No 10, Rue Nicolas-Appert, in the Le Marais district of Paris, appeared as France began mobilising 10,000 security personnel to protect 'sensitive sites' around the country. The move was announced by Jean-Yves Le Drian, the Minister for Defence, after a security briefing early this morning. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve also said that 5,000 officers would be sent to protect the country's Jewish schools, with troops deployed over the next two days as backup. The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls insisted the extra security was necessary because 'the threat is still present' after last week's attacks. Perpetrators: Said (left) and Cherif Kouachi (right) targeted the magazine after it repeatedly published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which some Muslims find deeply offensive . Attackers: The brothers fled Paris (pictured) on Wednesday last week then led police on a chase across northern France before they were shot and killed in a print works near the capital . Mr Valls told BFM television today that France is at war against 'terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam'. The news came as David Cameron was also briefed on the threat posed to Britain by security chiefs in Downing Street this morning. A No 10 spokesman said it had been agreed that future counter-terror training exercises will include scenarios similar to the Paris attack. French police also announced that they are hunting for another accomplice who they suspect helped deli attacker Amedy Coulibaly, 32, create his suicide video, before edited it and posting it online after the attacks had taken place. Coulibaly's girlfriend, Hayat Boumedienne, is also being hunted by police after it was revealed she crossed Europe and escaped into Syria in the days before her partner shot a policewoman dead, then killed four more in a Jewish supermarket.","Senior staff of Charlie Hebdo were killed by Said and Cherif Kouachi .

"Spotify added 10 million new users in the last two months of 2014, taking it to 60 million at the end of the year - despite its much publicised row with Taylor Swift. 15 million of those users were paying subscribers, up from 12.5 million in early November, when Spotify last released figures at the height of its dispute with the musician. However, it comes as Apple is believed to be preparing to relaunch the Beats Music service it bought alongside the headphone maker as an iTunes streaming service. Scroll down for video . Spotify added 10 million new users in the last two months of 2014, taking it to 60 million at the end of the year - despite its much publicised row with Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift removed her entire back catalog from music streaming service Spotify as she was promoting new album 1989, which sold 1.287 copies in its first week, just shy of Britney Spears' record for the biggest-ever album weekly sales by a female artist (1.319million). 'If I had streamed the new album, it's impossible to try to speculate what would have happened,' Taylor told Yahoo of leaving Spotify. 'Music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. And I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music.' 'We had an amazing 2014 at Spotify and owe it all to you, the music fans who listen, discover, share and celebrate music and artists with us every day of the yea,' the firm said. 'And before 2014 turned into 2015, we reached 15 million subscribers and 60 million active users! 'So as we set off into the new year, we want to send a giant thank you to all of you. We can't wait for the year in music ahead!' Late last year the firm revamped its pricing,offering people three months of its premium subscription service for $0.99, rather than the usual monthly cost of $9.99. The company also introduced its 'family plan' in November, enabling subscribers to add up to four family members with their own accounts on the service for $4.99 a month. 'More than 80% of our subscribers started as free users,' wrote Ek in his November blog post responding to the furore around Swift's removal of her music from Spotify. 'If you take away only one thing, it should be this: No free, no paid, no two billion dollars.' The latter figure related to the amount of royalties paid out by Spotify since its launch in 2008, including $1bn paid out in 2014 alone.

Late last year the firm revamped its pricing,offering people three months of its premium subscription service for $0.99, rather than the usual monthly cost of $9.99. In the United States, Iggy Azalea's 'Fancy' was the most streamed song of the year. Her album, 'The New Classic,' was the second most streamed album in America behind Sheeran's 'x.' Spotify said more than seven billion hours of music was streamed this year by more than 50 million users. It will reward listeners this month by offering new U.S. users a premium, three-month membership for just 99 cents. This year, Spotify experienced a shake-up when Taylor Swift decided to remove all of her music from the streaming service in late October. Some artists followed by removing some of their music from Spotify, including country star Jason Aldean. Behind Sheeran on the global list are Eminem, Calvin Harris, Avicii and David Guetta. On the U.S. tally, Drake, Kanye West, Lana Del Rey and Ariana Grande follow Eminem.

"ESPN host Hannah Storm was not quite ready for her close-up on SportsCenter on Sunday - and was caught wrestling her makeup artist out of the camera shot after realizing they were on TV. As a segment about Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers played during the show on Sunday morning, Storm used the brief break to get her makeup touched up. But when cameras returned to Storm, she was in the middle of having her lipstick reapplied - and saw no option but to strong-arm the woman off the screen. Caught on camera: A makeup artist was still in the shot touching up anchor Hannah Storm's lipstick when cameras panned back to the ESPN host during Sunday morning's SportsCenter . Heismanned: Storm promptly battled the makeup artist off screen after realizing they were live on air . Strong armed: She silently pushed the unidentified woman out of the live shot . The veteran anchor, 52, was clearly shocked at being caught and stared at the camera wide-eyed before she broke into a smile and continued her broadcast. But the slip-up didn't go unnoticed, with viewers rushing to social media to point out the error. Storm herself also took to social media to explain the mishap. 'The makeup artist (a good friend of mine) would have gotten in major trouble had she been seen on air. Hence, the stiff arm to protect her,' she claimed on Sunday morning. Storm was reporting from Texas, where the National Championship game will be played tonight. Oops: Storm looked shocked as she realized what had happened - before smoothly getting back to work . Explanation: After the mishap, she took to Twitter to explain that she had been protecting her friend . It comes a week after the anchor was praised for her professionalism as she announced the death of fellow anchor Stuart Scott, who passed away on January 4. He had been diagnosed with cancer in 2007. 'Today we choose not to say that Stuart lost to cancer at the age of 49,' she told viewers as she struggled to control her emotions. 'Instead, we’ll simply say we all lost Stuart.'

"An enormous impact crater thought to have been created by a meteorite the size of a house smashing into Earth has been discovered in the Antarctic ice sheet. Scientists conducting a routine aerial research flight above East Antarctica noticed a strange ring-like structure in the normally flat and featureless ice. It appeared to be a series of broken 'icebergs' surrounded by a 2km (1.24 miles) wide circular scar, surrounded by a few other smaller circular scars in the ice. Scroll down for video . The 2km (1.24 miles) wide ring above is thought to have been caused by a meteorite that smashed into the ice . The researchers later found two separate studies reporting that a meteorite fell in the area in 2004. The solar system is teaming with debris of ice and rocks in orbit around our sun. Occassionally these come close enough to the Earth to interact with the planets atmosphere, causing a streak of light in the sky. The debris that makes it to the surface are known as meteroites. They can vary in size from tiny grains to large boulders and form impact craters when they strike the surface at between 26,800mph 44,700mph. One of the largest meteorite found on Earth is the Hoba meteorite from southwest Africa, which weighs roughly 54,000 kg (119,000 pounds). Scientists predict that a meteorite around 30-50m (98 to 164 feet) across is capable of forming a 1km (0.6 miles) crater, will occur around every 1,000 years. However, the last impact of this size that we know of took place 55,000 years ago. Small but potentially devastating events such as the 1908 Tunguska impact in Russia are likely to occur every few hundred years. In February 2013, a meteor thought to be part of a family of asteroids orbiting around 93 million miles from our sun, streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk, Russia. It exploded with the force of 500 kilotons at a height of around 18 miles in the atmopshere, creating a bright flash and a cloud of dust. It is thought that some fragments made it to Earth, however, and small fragments have been recovered from impact craters made in the ice. An impact crater created by the meteor that exploded over Chelyabinksk in February 2013 . One reported a series of infrasound - low frequency sound capable of traveling huge distances below the limit of human hearing - detected on 2 September 2004. Six detectors around the world detected this infrasound thrown out by the exploding meteorite, allowing scientists to pinpoint it somewhere over East Antarctica. In a separate study, scientists at Davis Station, Australia's permanent base off the coast of East Antarctica, reported seeing a dust trail high up in the atmosphere around that time. They estimated that the falling object would have landed on the ice shelf. The findings suggests that a house-sized meteorite broke up in the atmosphere over Antarctica before the remains smashed into the ice sheet. Dr Christian Müller, a geophysicist from surveying company Fielax, was the scientist who first spotted the impact crater. He said: 'We were on a routine measuring flight near to the coast and we were flying above a small ice bluff. 'I looked out of the window and saw some unusual structures in the surface of the ice that were some broken ice looking like icebergs that is very unusual on a very flat ice shelf surrounded by a large wing shaped circular structure. 'I've never seen something like that before. My first thoughts were that it might be an impact structure from something from space like a meteorite.' The researchers, who are part of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, had been flying on a Basler BT-67 aircraft called Polar 6 over an area that is known as the Princess Ragnhild Coast of Queen Maud Land in Antarctica as part of a survey to study the rock beneath the ice. The aircraft, which was flying from the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Research Station, is equipped with ice penetrating radar that can map the geology beneath the ice sheet. They were also using magnetometers to measure small disturbances in the magnetic properties of the bedrock to help determine more about the terrain. As they flew over the Antarctic coast on 24 December 2014, Dr Müller spotted the large circular scar on the King Baudoin Ice Shelf, which forms over the ocean. The team then later returned to the site on 26 December, taking photographs and video of the site as well as using a laser to create a topographical map. They also used radar to help build up an image of the interior of the ice shelf beneath the circular structure in the hope of seeing what lies beneath it. The remains of the impact site was found on an ice shelf off the Princess Ragnhild Coast of East Antarctica. The researchers had flown from Princess Elisabeth Research Station while scientists at the Australian Davis Research Station had spotted debris from a suspected meteorite heading towards the area in 2004 . Six infrasound stations (marked by black triangles, detected the noise waves created by the meteor as travelled around the world, allowed scientists to pinpoint the source above East Antarctica as can be seen where the lines cross in the diagram above from a research paper in the Journal Earth Moon Planet . The scientists were flying in a Basler BT-67 aircraft called Polar 6 (above) from the Princess Elisabeth Station . They are still processing detail but Dr Graeme Eagles, a geophysicist and leader of the Alfred Wegener Institute's geophysical survey team at Princess Elisabeth Station, said that it appeared the ice and snow on the top part of the ice shelf had been disturbed. He said that this data should help to confirm that it was a meteorite that had caused the crater. He said: 'We can't say that with any confidence at this point. We can say we've found something very unusual. 'However, there are two very promising prior results - the infrasound data and the observed dust trail in 2004 - which support the hypothesis that this structure could have been created by a meteorite impact and certainly support the decision to collect more data for further analysis and investigation. 'The Australian study estimates that the body that left the debris they measured would have likely been about the size of a house and that it may have broken up on its way though the atmosphere. 'Interestingly enough, when we flew out to the circular structure in the ice on December 26th, we also spotted a number of smaller circular and sub-circular structures in the ice as well, which is consistent with the conclusion of the Australian study.' An image from NASA’s Aqua satellite of the meteor’s dust trail one hour after it is thought to have exploded above Antarctica in September 2004. The dust was spotted by Australian researchers in Antarctica at the time . Geophysicist Dr Christian Müller, above, spotted the impact crater from the window of the Polar 6 aircraft . Dr Müller and his colleague Tobais Binder (above) were conducting a survey on board the Polar 6 aircraft . Research by the Australian scientists after they saw the meteorite debris above Antarctica inn 2004 suggested that it was around seven to ten metres (23 to 33 feet) wide and weighted between 600 and 1,900 tonnes. They estimated that it exploded in the sky above Antarctica with the force of 12,000 tonnes of TNT and was travelling at a speed of 29,080 mph. The debris created by the explosion would then have crashed to Earth, smashing into the ice. Dr Eagles said that the team were now considering drilling down into the ice beneath the crater to see if they can find out more about what caused it. Dr Eagles added: 'if this object did break up before hitting the ice shelf, that perhaps some of the pieces were not travelling with enough energy to penetrate the ice shelf, and may have settled on or within it. 'We may find evidence of a dust layer in the ice surrounding the crater beneath 10 years of snow accumulation. I think that would be worth having a look at.' The scientists used radar carried in the nose of  Polar 6, seen above, to peer through the ice in the crater . Meteorites hit the Earth frequently, but few are big enough to cause any damage and occur in remote areas .","German scientists spotted the 2km (1.24mile) ring on a routine survey flight .

"Fraud and false claims for the state benefit that is most often abused has amounted to an astonishing £12.6 billion since the turn of the Millennium, MPs reported yesterday. The amount sucked out of Housing Benefit by welfare cheats, in exaggerated claims, and through straightforward bureaucratic blunders was the equivalent of around £1 billion a year for the first 13 years of the century. The loss to the taxpayer would pay the price of policing Britain for a year or cover more than four fifths of the bill for the road improvements that David Cameron has promised over the next five years. Scroll down for video . Nearly £12.6 billion has been spent on Housing Benefit overpayments since 2000 and that amount is going up . It would have paid the whole cost of four aircraft carriers instead of the two which have been developed for the Royal Navy since 2000. And the influential Public Accounts Committee, which acts as a public spending watchdog, revealed the amount of fraud and error in Housing Benefit is still going up. A report condemned the Department of Work and Pensions – which pays out for the benefit designed to cover the rent for people who cannot afford to pay their own – for failure to curb false claims, and added that MPs were sceptical of promises by civil servants to slash the losses by more than two thirds by this spring. Chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘Billions of pounds have been lost to the taxpayer as a result of the Department’s failure to tackle Housing Benefit fraud and error effectively. Around £12.6 billion has been spent on Housing Benefit overpayments since 2000, money that could have been used to improve the system. ‘The size of overpayments is going up not down.’ Curbing fraud and error in Housing Benefit has proved difficult for all governments over the past 20 years, partly because the benefit is handed out by local councils which have varying levels of efficiency in detecting dishonest or inflated claims. Public Accounts Committee Chairman Margaret Hodge said the billions wasted could have been used to improve the system . In the last financial year, 2013/14, losses amounted to £1.4 billion, more than £400 million higher than in 2010/11. Of this, £340 million was outright fraud and £900 million was claimant error, for example when someone who has been unemployed gets a job but forgets to tell the council that they have an income. The line between fraud and error is often blurred. Another £150 million was lost in mistakes by staff calculating and paying the benefit. Housing Benefit losses account for more than £4 in every £10 of everything lost by the Government in all false benefit claims. Officials working for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith have said they will cut the level of loss, currently 5.8 per cent of all the Housing Benefit paid out, to 1.7 per cent by this spring. Mrs Hodge said: ‘Given the lack of evidence that the Department is getting to grips with fraud and error, we view with scepticism the Department’s confidence that it will meet its target.’ She said the Department was expecting ‘significant’ benefits from a siwth to ‘real-time information’, under which Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will tell the DWP as soon as someone gets a job, rather than giving DWP officials updates on the earnings of claimants just once a year. Mrs Hodge said officials were ‘doing little else to tackle Housing Benefit fraud and error’.","Fraudulent and false claims have totalled £12.6billion since the year 2000 .

"Climbers captured spectacular pictures of ice appearing to glow blue as they descended 5,280ft into a glacier in Alaska. American glacier trekking guide Jared Carlson snapped the eerie pictures a quarter of a mile into the Mendenhall Glacier, in Juneau. The 36-year-old was joined by fellow climber Jason Nelson, 37, as the pair explored the moulin, which is a circular, vertical well-like shaft within a glacier. Scroll down for video . Climber Jason Nelson manoeuvres through Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska as the pair tackle a moulin shaft . The courageous climbers descended more than 5,000ft into the glacier in Alaska, snapping pictures as they went . Jason Nelson waves down to let Jared Carlson know he is safe as he prapres to descend a particularly difficult section of the vertical shaft . Jared, of Spokane, Washington, said: 'Moulins can be incredibly intimidating. Picture a vertical shaft in the ice, 40 stories deep, with a huge river of water falling into it, which could not be any colder unless it was ice. 'The sound of the falling water is deafeningly loud and the spray from the falling water spreads out the deeper you go, and it gets continually darker. 'Add to this the fact that your life is entirely and wholly dependent on your technical competence, with absolutely zero margin for error - if you screw up and fall, you will die. 'Combine all of these factors and you have an incredibly intimidating, yet astonishing, indescribably beautiful environment that is unlike anything else on earth. Jason appears to be in another world as he walks among the crystal caves created by the glacier deep underground . The pair described the climb as like dangling a rope into an enormous vertical blue cathedral that is constantly gushing with water . The two climbers spent a total of eight hours inside the huge crevasse before making the long climb back out . 'The best way I can describe it is hanging on a string in an enormous vertical blue cathedral, while being drenched by ice water, with the soundtrack of a freight train constantly assaulting your ability to think straight, it's intense.' From around 350 to 400 feet deep, it still took Jared and Jason three hours to ascend out of the moulin, after spending eight hours in total inside. Using several climbing ropes, lots of ice climbing screws and standard ice climbing equipment, they were able to make their way through the glacier in temperatures of four degrees Celsius. The glowing images disguise the danger the two men were in as they took on the climb, which could have seen them fall to their deaths . The climbers return each year to take on the glaciers and explore the daily changes that happen in the huge ice caverns . Jared says: 'The only consistency on the glacier is that it's always changing. 'So, with each shot, I'm recording a moment in time that will never exist again and all of the features that I have photographed no longer exist. 'Every time I think I've seen it all, that the glacier can no longer surprise me, I prove myself wrong. 'There's always something new to find and discover which keeps me coming back year after year.'","American glacier trekking guide made the dangerous descend with fellow climber Jason Nelson .

"A petrol station which became the first to sell fuel for less than £1 a litre since 2009 is about to run dry after being deluged by motorists desperate to fill up. The owner of the independent Harvest Energy station knocked 6p off the price of his petrol yesterday afternoon after becoming fed up of supermarkets 'cheating' customers with rip-off costs. But Dr Velautham Sarveswaran, who runs the cut-price garage in Birmingham, had just 500 litres of petrol left earlier this afternoon with four of his eight pumps running dry. Dr Velautham Sarveswaran lowered his petrol prices to 99.7p a litre yesterday but has already almost run dry . The cut-price garage in Birmingham had just 500 litres of petrol left earlier this afternoon with four of its eight pumps running dry . He is now hoping to receive an emergency delivery to keep up with demand, as motorists drive dozens of miles to fill up at his pumps. Dr Sarveswaran said: The next delivery would have been tomorrow morning but hopefully we will get another delivery around 4pm. 'I hoped it would last until tomorrow morning but we have already almost run out.' Drivers queued up this morning to fill up on the cheap petrol after the garage slashed its prices yesterday afternoon. One motorist Kathy Griffiths, 47, from Solihull, said: 'I drove past and was shocked, finally less than a pound a litre. I was going to go up the road to the Shell garage. I definitely pulled in because it was under a pound. It’s a no brainer.' A garage in the West Midlands has slashed petrol prices to 99.7p a litre - the lowest its been in five years . She added: 'I can’t remember it being this cheap. It seems like a lifetime ago.' Cusrtomer service advisor Dave Edwards, 35, from Kings Heath, said: 'I used to use a Shell petrol station but over the last month-and-a-half me and the wife have noticed that the prices here have been coming down gradually. 'We were on the internet last night when we found out that this is the first station to bring it down under a pound. That price is absolutely brilliant. Lowest price I’ve seen since I’ve been driving which is six years.' MailOnline revealed yesterday afternoon that Dr Sarveswaran was cutting his petrol price to 99.7p a litre - the cheapest fuel has been since May 2009. 'I will still be making money by cutting prices and my customers wanted to see me break the £1 barrier. My customers are happy,' he said. 'People travel as far as 20 miles just for my petrol prices. 'The supermarkets continue to make a fortune without passing the price cuts to their customers. It is a scandal. They are cheating people.' Dr Sarveswaran bought all three of his garages in 2002 after they had closed down, bringing the failed businesses back from the dead with a strategy of 'consistent low pricing'. 'The customers have been praising us for the low prices and our customer services and they keep coming back,' he said. 'We respect our customers and were willing to reduce the petrol to 99.7p. Happy customers make us happy and proud. It is a great feeling that we make the customers satisfied.' Drivers queued up this morning to fill up on the cheap petrol after the garage slashed its prices yesterday afternoon . The garage owner ran out of petrol three times over Christmas after lowering petrol to £1.05 and diesel to £1.12 a litre. However, the demand for his fuel is likely to be even higher after his petrol stations became the first to sell fuel for less than a £1 a litre in five years. Petrol last averaged less than £1 on May 31, 2009, when the price was 99.9p. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has fallen from $114 l in June to $49.95 on Friday – a drop of 56 per cent. The Government has demanded that petrol retailers pass on the fall in costs swiftly to consumers and petrol now averages about £1.10 a litre. The station lowered its prices following a steady reduction in the wholesale cost of crude oil . A graph showing the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol since 2010. Prices have been rising but began to fall from the beginning of 2014 . The wholesale price of fuel accounts for around 20 to 25 per cent of a litre of fuel at that price, with a further 57.95p in fuel duty, and VAT charged at 20 per cent, added on top. Supermarkets and fuel giants such as BP and Shell have reduced the price at the pump for the consumer however none have cut their prices to under a £1 a litre. On Tuesday Chancellor George Osborne warned airlines and power giants to pass on savings made from plummeting fuel prices to the consumer or face Government sanctions. Osborne insisted they should quickly follow the lead of petrol retailers and slash their charges following the fall in the price of oil. The Chancellor insisted it was ‘vital this was passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares’. Shock fall: After spending years mainly above $100 a barrel, oil has dived to $50 since the end of summer . The first case of swine flu had just been found in Britain, Bonkers by Dizzee Rascal was number one in the charts - and petrol cost less than £1 a litre. And while it may seem bonkers to believe, especially considering that petrol cost as much as £1.40 a litre not long ago,  May 2009 was the last time, on average, that petrol was sold at that price - until today. While  today's price cut is at just three stations, it could be a sign of good things to come. The RAC has warned since November that prices would fall below a £1 as the average cost of oil plumetted. Spokesman Simon Williams said: 'What’s currently happening at the pumps with falling fuel prices is something many motorists will not remember seeing before. 'Talk of prices going up like a rocket and falling like a feather could not be further from the truth as retailers have been quick to pass on savings at the forecourt since the RAC forecast on December 6 that prices were due to come down by 7p a litre for petrol and 6p for diesel.'","Price of fuel was slashed to less than £1 a litre for first time in five years .

"First Milk is delaying paying dairy farmers for two weeks after supermarket price wars saw the price of a pint of milk plummet to 22 pence last week . More than 1,000 farmers were not paid for their milk yesterday after a crash in prices plunged the industry into crisis. The biggest dairy co-operative First Milk delayed payments to its 1,300 farmer members by a fortnight – and cut the price it pays them. Campaigners warned it was ‘the worst crisis the industry has ever seen’, with little sign of matters improving. Global milk prices have plummeted in recent months, meaning some British farmers now receive as little as 11.4p a pint (20p a litre) – well below the average 15.9p a pint (28p per litre) it costs to produce it. Just a year ago farmers could expect to receive 19.2p a pint (34p a litre). The amount paid to farms is now at its lowest level for eight years, far lower than in 2012, when farmers blockaded milk processors in protest at the low prices they were paid. First Milk, which sells milk to be turned into cheese, butter, yogurt and powdered milk around the world, has increasingly struggled to pay farmers as the lower prices drive down its income. Its announcement comes after co-operative Arla and processors Dairy Crest and Muller Wiseman also cut their milk prices in recent weeks. More than 60 dairy farmers are now going out of business every month, according to the National Farmers’ Union. First Milk chairman Sir Jim Paice, a Conservative MP and former farming minister, said the dairy industry was going through a period of ‘extreme volatility’. Scroll down for video . Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland are selling four pints of milk for just 89p, while Tesco (pictured) is selling at £1 . He added: ‘We understand that the milk payment deferral will cause concern for members as direct debits and payments will have been lined up against milk cheques.’ He added: ‘We are aware that hundreds of UK dairy farmers are unlikely to find a home for their milk this spring. ‘Our priority is to make the business and our processing assets as secure as possible.’ Farmers have condemned supermarkets for cutting prices even further. Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland now sell four pints of milk for 89p, while Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose are not far behind at £1. The stores insist they are funding the price cut through their own profits and have not changed what they pay farmers. But farmers say selling milk more cheaply than mineral water is devaluing the product. Rob Harrison, of the NFU’s dairy board, said: ‘It looks like this is going to be the worst crisis the dairy industry has ever seen. Retailers are fighting over market share and they are driving farmers out of business. If they don’t support us there will be very few dairy farmers left in this country in six months’ time.’ NFU president Meurig Raymond warned that as farmers have been paid less and less, ‘farm costs remain some 36 per cent higher than they were eight years ago and the single largest cost component of a dairy farm, animal feed, is more than 50 per cent higher than 2007 levels’. He added: ‘This combination has left many producers under extreme financial pressure and fearing for the future of their dairy businesses. You only have to look at the number of dairy farmers now leaving the sector.’ David Handley, of lobby group Farmers For Action, said it was a ‘dire situation’, warning banks may ‘see this as a death knell’ and stop supporting some farmers, many of whom are already financially stretched. Campaigners fear the crisis will particularly hit small traditional farms, with large intensive farms increasing their market share.","Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland are currently selling four pints of milk for 89p .

"Pamela Anderson, a long-time and incredibly vocal advocate for animal rights, has reached out to an Australian celebrity who she thinks may be destined to forge the same plant-lined path. Anderson, 47, sent a hamper overflowing with cruelty-free products to model Lara Bingle, who recently announced she and partner Sam Worthington were living a vegetarian lifestyle. 'I hear you are following a plant-based diet', the Baywatch star wrote in a personal note accompanying the hamper. Scroll down for video . American actress Pamela Anderson sent a hamper full of vegan produce to Australian model Lara Bingle . Lara Bingle recently said in an interview she and partner Sam Worthington were living a vegetarian lifestyle . The hamper, sent via animal rights group PETA included a whole host of meat and dairy-free products . 'I'm sure you'll find it keeps you fit and healthy. I thought you might like to try some of these delicious vegan foods that my friends at PETA helped me put together,' Anderson continued. Bingle announced in an interview with Paula Joye's website The Joye that she and Worthington that she decided to make the change to vegetarianism in late 2013, saying yo-yo dieting over the years had a negative effect on her body. 'This change has made me feel stronger and healthier. My boyfriend Sam and I are both vegetarian, so we help each other. I cook a lot when we’re at home. We’re very ‘planty’ people,' the model told the website. Included in the hamper, filled with produce from Cruelty Free Products, was faux bacon, cheedar 'cheese' sauce, herb pate and a hot cocoa mix. Anderson recommended beach beauty Bingle try the chocolate truffles first . The Australian-born beauty has previously described herself as a 'planty' person . There was a note from Anderson herself attached to the hamper (not pictured) Organic chocolate, cacao nibs, quinoa crackers, risotto and a thai green curry paste were also included in the package, as was a PETA vegan starter kit. Anderson also wrote in the attached note: 'It's easier than ever to avoid all the fat and cholesterol in animal foods while indulging in great-tasting treats. The animal rights activist also recommended her favourite pick from the basket. 'The chocolate truffles are amazing – I'd eat those first.' Lara Bingle's publicist told Daily Mail Australia she is currently out of the country and therefore has not received the package. Anderson has been a member of PETA for decades, promoting veganism and campaigning against the use of real fur . Bingle's publicist said she had not yet received the package as she is currently overseas . Many other Australian personalities are known for their dedication to the plant-based lifestyle including singers Sia and Xavier Rudd, and actor Isabel Lucas. Anderson has been a member of PETA for decades, promoting veganism and campaigning against the use of real fur. She has appeared in many campaigns for the group, often stripping down to little or nothing to get her point across.","Pamela Anderson sent a hamper full of vegan goodies to Lara Bingle with the help of animal rights group PETA .

"An escaped rhea - a six-foot tall flightless bird capable of killing a human with a single blow - gave the police officers the slip again yesterday after almost a year on the run. The rhea, which is closely related to the ostrich, is believed to be one of three which escaped from a farm in February last year. The three giant birds, named Mary, Mungo and Midge, escaped from Graham and Julie Fleming's land in Wicken Bonhunt, Essex. Scroll down for video . An escaped rhea - a six-foot tall flightless bird capable of killing a human with a single blow - is on the run in Hertfordshire . The flightless bird was reported to the police on Sunday after it was spotted racing through a field, but when police arrived they were unable to catch it . Midge was captured in June last year, but Mary and Mungo remain at large, surviving in the wild for 11 months. The flightless bird was reported to the police on Sunday after it was spotted racing through a field in Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire. But when officers arrived they could do little but sit and watch as the bird, which can reach speeds of 40mph, raced past. East Herts Rural Police tweeted yesterday: 'PC Watson & PCSO Steve have located the rhea, the problem is they can't keep up with it. 'They've some video footage to share, it's very fast. 'We've managed to upload the video, you can just make out the Rhea running from right to left. It's quick.' The rhea, which is closely related to the ostrich, is believed to be one of three which escaped from a farm in February last year . Police officers filmed the escaped rhea dashing through a field at 40mph, but could not get near to it . It is the second time an escaped rhea has had the police in a flap, after one called Rita escaped from a farm in nearby Clavering, Essex. Rita - also known locally as Chris Rhea - was on the loose from March until May, when she was shot dead and turned into gourmet sausages. Mr Fleming said: 'This is one of our original three - Mary, Mungo and Midge - which escaped last February. 'I suggest they are left to live their life and not hounded and shot like the one that escaped last year. 'They are not a danger to the public and pose no greater threat to motorists than deer.' It is the second time an escaped rhea has had the police in a flap, after one called Rita (pictured) escaped from a far . Rita (pictured) - also known locally as Chris Rhea - was shot and turned into sausages after months at large in Essex and Hertfordshire . When Rita was on the run last year, the RSPCA warned the public to stay away from the escaped rhea. A spokesman said: 'They look nice but they are so strong it's unbelievable. They aren't listed as a dangerous animal but can kill you with one strike of their feet because their claws are six inches long. 'They will also go for your eyes with their beak.' The number of rheas bred in farms across the UK has increased in recent years as its meat is very low fat, containing just one per cent fat. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We will become involved if the birds pose a danger to public safety, for example if they went into a road. 'We advise the public not to approach the birds as, like any wild animal, they may become spooked and scared. 'This may cause them to run into a road or cause a danger to others.' The Common Rhea, also known as Rhea Americana or 'Nandu', is native to South American and often called the South American ostrich. In the wild, they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter, which means they are ideally suited to the changeable British climate. They can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone, with the males being larger than the females. They are omnivores but mainly eat insects, shoots, leaves and grasses. Rheas have six-inch claws on their feet and large wings that are used in courtship, mating and aggressive displays. Male birds can bite or knock out a person with one blow from their claws, while female rheas are unlikely to be aggressive. In South America, rheas, which can live for up to 40 years are farmed for their meat, while in the UK they are increasingly popular as pets.","Escaped rhea - a six-foot tall flightless bird - is on the run in Hertfordshire .

"From ancient mead-halls to modern pubs and clubs, it seems mankind has always enjoyed drinking - but the way we talk about alcohol has changed a lot over the centuries. Whereas once the words 'drunken' and 'inebriated' sufficed to describe over-indulging, now we resort to elaborate euphemisms such as 'squiffy', 'blotto' and 'wasted'. And in addition to modern slang for drinking, there are a host of now obsolete words once used to describe a heavy binge - the likes of 'bumpsy', 'suckey' and 'hit under the wing'. Scroll down for video . Historic: This 15th-century manuscript shows how excessive drinking has always been popular . Horrors: Gin Lane, by William Hogarth, depicts 18th-century drunkenness; a new book traces the way people have talked about alcohol over the centuries . The history of the ways the English language describes alcohol has been traced by eminent linguistics professor David Crystal using the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary. In a new book, the academic reveals that the vocabulary of drinking is richer than almost any other topic - and unites English-speakers across barriers of class, age and gender. During the Anglo-Saxon period, the words 'drunken' and 'fordrunken' were the most common ways of describing alcoholic excess, Professor Crystal writes in the book Words in Time and Place. However, in time there developed 'a universal trend to avoid stating the obvious', according to the author, and English-speakers began to resort to euphemisms when they discussed drinking. Fordrunken (Old English): First used in Alfred the Great's translations of Latin works, it continued in use throughout the Middle Ages and is found in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Tippled (1564): A 'tippler' was someone who sold ale in a tavern - the word is thought to be related to 'tap'. It later became attached to somone who drinks a lot. Bumpsy (1611): Apparently inspired by the way drunkards are more likely to bump into things because they cannot walk straight. The word 'bum' was also a children's word for a drink in the 16th century. Blootered (1805): A 'blooter' is a clumsy oaf in medieval Scottish slang, leading to the adjective meaning drunk which is still in use in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Up the pole (1897): A nautical term - the pole was the mast, so someone 'up the pole' would be in a dangerous situation. It first appeared in the dictionary after a judge asked what it meant during a court case. Poggled (1923): Military slang which has its origins in the Hindi word 'pagal', meaning a madman or an idiot. It was used particularly when a drunk person was behaving wildly. Tired and emotional (1981): A modern euphemism usually used in a comic setting. The OED first cites it in an episode of political sitcom Yes Minister. The earliest slang terms included the 14th-century 'cup-shotten', meaning overcome with liquor, 'inebriate', dating back to 1497, and 'bousy' - a forerunner of the modern 'booze', borrowed from Dutch and first recorded in 1529. Some words still in common usage have a long pedigree - for example 'intoxicated', which originally meant poisoned, was first used in relation to drink as far back as 1576. William Shakespeare and the King James Bible are commonly regarded as two of the greatest influences on the English language, and the situation is no different when it comes to phrases for drunkenness. 'In drink' was apparently coined by Shakespeare in the play Henry IV Part 1, where Falstaff uses it while talking to Prince Hal, and 'in their cups' makes its first appearance in the Bible's description of how alcohol affects the mood. Professor Crystal divides the slang terms into a variety of different categories, based on the ways they characterise the process of losing control. He writes in the book: 'One fruitful vein is to find terms that characterize drunken appearance (owl-eyed, pie-eyed, cock-eyed, lumpy, blue, lit) or behaviour, especially erratic movement (slewed, bumpsy, reeling ripe, towrow, rocky, on one’s ear, zigzag, tipped, looped) or lack of any movement at all (stiff, paralytic).' Over the years, some drinkers appear to have viewed drunkenness as similar to being cooked - 'stewed', 'boiled', 'pickled' and 'steamed' have all arisen since the 18th century. While the origins of many terms - such as 'rummy' and 'under the influence' - may be relatively obvious, others are rather more complex. 'Three sheets in the wind', for instance, is a naval analogy - 'sheets' are ropes attached to a sail, so when three of them are loose the sail will flap around and cause the boat to weave like a drunk person. Change: But events such as Munich's Oktoberfest uphold traditional ways of drinking - and getting drunk . Contrast: Now drinking increasingly centres on bars and clubs which serve shots of spirits such as tequila . Work: David Crystal explores how English has been adapted over time in his new book, pictured . A minority of words attempt the subtle task of describing someone who is only a little drunk, such as 'squiffy', popularised by the novels of P.G. Wodehouse, and 'half-shaved', used in the US during the 19th century. Most drinking slang appears to have developed organically, but some is promoted by the actions of governments - for example, since drink-driving was outlawed in Britain in 1966, the phrase 'over the limit' has been used to describe being drunk. Professor Crystal also points out that many words which originally described drinking have over the past few decades mutated and become attached to drug use as well. 'High', 'loaded' and 'stoned' all began as alcohol slang, even though now they would more naturally describe someone who had taken narcotics. Elsewhere in the book the author - one of the world's greatest experts on the English language, who is now Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor - also follows the development of words for topics such as dying, money, fooling around and going to the toilet. The work is based on the Historical Thesaurus, which uses the world-famous Oxford English Dicitionary to chart how different words meaning the same thing come into use before falling out of popularity. Words in Time and Place: Exploring Language Through the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary, by David Crystal, is out now published by Oxford University Press. Give up the ghost (Old English): This phrase dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, when 'gast' (ghost) was commonly used to mean spirit or soul. Pass (1340): To say that someone has 'passed' is considered sensitive language in North America - it first appeared in the 14th century, and was popularised by Shakespeare in King Lear. Bite the dust (1697): This phrase was also rendered as 'bite the ground' and 'bite the sand' when it was first used by writers such as Dryden and Pope. It is based on the image of a soldier falling to the ground during battle. Snuff out (1864): Based on the metaphor of extinguishing a candle. The phrase, transformed into 'snuff it', is now usually used in a casual context. Meet your maker (1933): Despite the apparently archaic nature of this phrase, it was first used by American crime novelist Dorothy L. Sayers. Privy (1225): Taken from the French 'privée', meaning private place. This was for many years the main word used to describe the toilet. Jakes (1530s): The etymology of this word is unclear, but it may derive from the name Jaques. It is now mostly heard in regional dialects. Water closet (1755): A euphemistic term, usually abbreviated to WC, which alludes to the small size of most toilets - comparable to a closet. Outhouse (1819): Originally meant any building outside, but became attached to toilets during the time when they were commonly installed in separate buildings near the main home. Loo (1940): Another obscure origin. It could be an abbreviation of 'Waterloo', or come from the French 'l'eau', as an allusion to 'water'. Commonly associated with the genteel middle class. Hoddypeak (1500): Based on an old word for a snail's shell. The horns of a snail were associated with the 'cuckold's horns' which denoted a husband whose wife was unfaithful. Nincompoop (1673): The suffix 'poop' was used as a verb meaning to deceive. 'Nin' could be a reference to the word 'ninny', or it could denote the name 'Nick'. Silly billy (1834): This rhyming phrase was often adopted by clowns who 'acted the fool' alongside a straight man. It became attached as a term of abuse to prominent people called William, most famously King William IV. Plonker (1981): Popularised by Only Fools and Horses, where main character Del Boy used it as a term of abuse for his sidekick Rodney. Earlier in the 20th century, the word was a slang term for penis. Numpty (1988): Possibly an abbreviation of 'numbskull', with the ending adapted by analogy with the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty. First used in Scotland. Money (1325): Even though this is by far the most common word today, it did not enter English until the 14th century. In the early days of banknotes, 'money' was sometimes used to refer only to coins. Mammon (1539): A name for the Devil in the Bible. It became the personification of greed, and for several centuries was also used to mean money or riches in a more general sense. Mopus (1699): Taken from a German word for bread, this was the name of a small coin. The phrase 'having the mopusses' is used now in the Midlands and North of England. Dough (1851): This ancient word became a slang term for money in the US during the 19th century, and was then imported into the UK by Arthur Conan Doyle and P.G. Wodehouse. Lolly (1943): 'Lollipop' was Cockney rhyming slang for 'drop', which referred to money given as a tip.","Professor David Crystal has used a historical thesaurus to trace the ways we talk about getting drunk in English .

"The ongoing eruptions from Indonesia's volcano Mount Sinabung have blanketed the nearby small town of Berastagi in tons of volcanic ash. Pictures from the rural north Sumatra village show rooftops and streets covered in the harmful substance, which is made up of tiny fragments of jagged rock, minerals, and volcanic glass. The 2,460-metre volcano has been issuing frequent small to medium explosions of hot ash, lava and gases – which spread out to around five kilometres - since September last year, leading to the evacuation of almost 25,000 people. Those who remain in the city are seen covering their faces with masks and scarves as they brave the abandoned streets and the toxic ash which can damage a person's lungs and cause suffocation. In August, the volcano erupted after lying dormant for 400 years, killing at least two people and displacing 30,000 others. An eruption in February this year killed 16 people. The latest series of eruptions began on October 5, forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes. In January this year, a number of explosions forced thousands of residents across three districts to flee their homes after ash spread as far as 35km, The Jakarta Post reported . Mount Sinabung is now among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The country is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.

"Keysar Trad, one of the Muslim leaders called to a meeting with Australian Federal Police as the Sydney siege unfolded, is in no doubt that gunman Man Haron Monis would have surrendered, if he had been allowed to talk with him. 'They could have let someone like me talk with him, someone who had met him before, I knew him and I would have got him to surrender, I am fairly confident,' Mr Trad said. He said neither his offer nor that of other community leaders made during the day, including that of Australia's most senior Muslim cleric the Grand Mufti, was accepted. Further, he added, they were not sought out for any advice as it dragged on. 'I was saying it all day, let us help.' Scroll down for video . 'He would have surrendered'. Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad is pictured on his way to a meeting with government officials last year to discuss the counter-terrorism laws. He says police should have involved Muslim leaders in negotiations with Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis . The same year in which Sydney Siege gunman Man Monis (left) was dropped from the national watch lists, it’s been revealed he was also reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal. Islamic Friendship Association founder Keysar Trad said police should have let him talk to the hostage-taker during the Martin Place Lindt cafe stand-off last month. 'This person was looking for someone to pull him out of it,' Mr Trad said. It's believed among those represented at the Monday morning (December 15) briefing with the Australian Federal Police, which was in relation to anti-terror raids and not the early stages of the siege, were representatives of the Islamic Friendship Association, Islamic Council of New South Wales, the United Muslim Women's Association, Lebanese Muslim Association, the Muslim Village and a former AFP official of Muslim background. Word of the drama in Sydney's CBD had begun to filter through to the 10am gathering at a Bankstown hotel in the city's south-west and those involved in the meeting say they made it known they wanted to be involved, if required. The official briefing was quickly wound up but Mr Trad, who is the founder of the Islamic Friendship Association, revealed that there were tense scenes even as the meeting came to an end. He said some at the gathering disagreed over the potential level of involvement from the Muslim community, saying 'we had an argument'.

On his side, he said, were younger members of the Muslim community, who were also present at the meeting: 'They were ready to go too, there were two of them dressed in their traditional robes and they agreed and said ""if it is a young person, we will talk to him"" and they were available at any time.' Mr Trad also wants answers, as to why officials were selective in who was told the vital information about Monis' identity as the day wore on. 'They told some community leaders (Monis' identity) and not me but I would have happily signed a letter taking responsibility,' he said. Heavily armed police stormed the Lindt cafe in the early hours of Tuesday morning after hostage-taker Monis fired shots. Two of his captors were killed, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson . Man Haron Monis pictured in 2009, bound in chains and holding an Australian flag outside Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney. He'd been charged with seven counts of unlawfully using the postal service to menace, after sending harassing letters to families of Australian soldiers. He would later be granted bail despite facing sexual assault and accessory to murder charges . The anguish of hostages taken by Monis inside the Lindt cafe was clearly visible, as the stand-off crippled the heart of Sydney last month . A decision on the future of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe has yet to be made by the owners, almost a month after the tragic events in Martin Place . 'I find it difficult to believe he knew what he was doing, he did not plan it, he had no idea what he wanted. 'Someone like that needs someone to talk to, talk him around and tell him ""let these people go"". 'I was saying it all day, that would have been the best way to deal with this guy was this way, I am certain.' More than 100,000 bouquets were placed at the shrine in Martin Place in the days after the siege. The flowers placed in memory of the Lindt cafe siege hostages will feature as part of a permanent memorial, after having been mulched . 'I had a couple of meetings with him and he just needed someone to guide him. We were all ready to help, even the Mufti offered to go and speak to him. 'This person was looking for someone to pull him out of it.' It's been revealed the Grand Mufti of Australia, Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammad, was ready to become involved but was not sought for advice nor involved at an official level, with senior police admitting at the time that even 11 hours into the stand-off there had been limited, if any, contact directly with the gunman. 'At the time I didn’t know it was him. I had met him before and if I had known earlier it was him I would’ve been happy to try and talk to him, I’m sure he wouldn’t have done anything to me at that stage,” Mr Trad said. While others suggest police erred in not taking advice from Muslim community leaders, Ahmed Kilani of the Muslim Village sees it differently saying 'I can't really find any fault in what they have done. They were being very, very careful not to risk people's lives' However, others present at the meeting on Monday morning weren't as critical. 'No one really knew, at that stage,' said Ahmed Kilani of the Muslim Village. 'I can't really find any fault in what they have done. They were being very, very careful not to risk people's lives, we don't know all that went on, it is a tricky situation. I knew who he was by 3pm that day. 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, isn't it?' Mr Kilani added.","Muslim leader insist Man Haron Monis 'would have surrendered'

"Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming, according to a new study. Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur-rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate. Scroll down for video . Eruptions of volcanoes like Tavurvur in Papa New Guinea in 2006  had a greater impact on the climate in the past 15 years than had previously been appreciated and may require climate models to be revised . However, the new study has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature. This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05°C to 0.12°C over the past 15 years. Instead of eruptions, some scientists claim one of the causes of the ‘plateau’ in sea-surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water. They believe this exchange is occurring between warm, surface waters and cold, deep waters below 2,300ft (700 metres) – as if the warming is ‘hiding’ underwater. Easterly trade winds of the Pacific Ocean have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths. Stronger trade winds blowing from South America to Australia have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1°C and 0.2°C, . This would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years. The warm water won’t hide below the surface forever: scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators, such as sea level or ocean circulation. Since 1998, the warmest year on record, the steep increase in global temperatures seen during the 1990s has levelled off, failing to match computer model predictions for climate change. This pause, or hiatus, has been blamed on weak solar activity and increased uptake of heat by the world's oceans. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year concluded that the deep oceans had been responsible for absorbing an increasing amount of heat, but warned that this could not continue indefinitely. However, in a paper published in November last year, atmospheric scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that small volcanic eruptions in the early 21st century, which had been largely overlooked, were responsible for up to a third of the hiatus in warming. Now researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in California, have found signs of the effects from eruptions from the late 20th century and early 21st century in the atmospheric temperature, moisture and amount of sunlight reflected from the atmosphere. They also found that the eruption of Pinatubo, a volcano on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, which last erupted in 1991, also caused a drop in tropical rainfall. 'The fact that these volcanic signatures are apparent in multiple independently measured climate variables really supports the idea that they are influencing climate in spite of their moderate size,' said Mark Zelinka, a climate scientist at Lawrence Livermore and one of the authors of the new study. This graph shows average land and ocean temperature anomalies between 1961 and 1990 around the world . Small eruptions from volcanoes like Japan's Mount Ontake throw sulphuric acid and aerosols into the air but many of these may have been accumulating unnoticed as a layer between the troposphere and stratosphere . The apparent mismatch between observed temperature increases and predictions from climate change models has led to some to claim that global warming has stalled, as seen by the black line in the graph above . 'If we wish to accurately simulate recent climate change in models, we cannot neglect the ability of these smaller eruptions to reflect sunlight away from Earth.' The findings confirm the work of Dr David Ridley, a climate scientist at MIT who was the lead author on the November study on volcanos. He found that droplets of sulphuric  acid and aerosols were accumulating at the intersection between the stratosphere and troposphere layers of the atmosphere. Using ground, air and space based instruments, Dr Ridley and his colleagues were able to get a better estimate of the aerosols accumulating in these layers, around six to nine miles above the Earth's surface. Globally, there are thousands of volcanoes, like this one in Russia, throwing aerosols into the atmosphere . Previously they had been missed as most satellite measurements of volcanic aerosols are restricted to the parts of the stratosphere higher than nine miles as cloud cover can interfere with measurements below that. This means, particularly around the poles where the stratosphere extends down to six miles above the surface, a significant chunk of volcanic aerosols were being missed. He estimated that that since 2000 volcanoes may have caused cooling of between 0.05 degrees C and 0.12 degrees C. Dr Benjamin Santer, who led the new study, said: 'This new work shows that the climate signals of late 20th- and early 21st-century volcanic activity can be detected in a variety of different observational data sets.' Professor Ross McKitrick, an environmental economist from the University of Guelph in Canada, said the results could mean that climate models that are used to inform policy decisions are inaccurate. If volcanic eruptions are masking some of the impacts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, then the climate may be more sensitive than previously thought, or changes in aerosols could be responsible for some of the temperature changes attributed to carbon dioxide. He said: 'If small variations in volcanic activity turn out to have larger and more persistent climatic effects than previously thought, this should have important implications for how climate models are parameterized and how greenhouse gas attribution studies are done. 'The study seems to me to raise the possibility that commonly-used historical reconstructions of volcanic dust forcing may not have been all that reliable. 'Climate modelers rely on dust veil indexes that use measures of known historical volcanic activity to estimate optical effects in the atmosphere. 'These are then used to estimate natural forcings over the 20th century, which are then used in greenhouse gas signal detection (attribution) studies. 'If the historical reconstructions weren't capturing the full magnitude of volcanic effects on the climate, as this study suggests, that presumably means those attribution studies need re-examination as well.'","Volcanoes may have cooled the Earth by 0.05°C to 0.12°C since 2000 .

"President Barack Obama started his presidency by removing a  bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office, sending the Queen of England an iPod filled with his own speeches and gifting a boxed set of 25 DVDs to then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown – which he reportedly couldn't play in the UK. There were no apologies for the Borat-like gaffes, leading pundits to predict that America's new chief executive would insist being president means never having to say you're sorry. Not so much. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . WORLD RECORD IN THE 40-METER  BACKTRACK: Obama apologized after comparing his performance on a bowling alley to the Special Olympics . I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU BUMPED: Obama's golf game displaced a military couple's wedding last month in Hawaii, bring another apology . REMEMBER THIS? Obama apologized in July 24 after he said Cambridge, Massachusetts police had 'acted stupidly' by arresting a black Harvard professor in front of his home . A list published by The Washington Post includes 13 Obama apologies, not including what his conservative adversaries consider an overall apologetic tone about America's position of dominance in the world. The list also omits the tepid mea culpa the White House offered Monday for sending no one of importance to a massive anti-terror rally held Sunday in Paris. 'I think it's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile' than the U.S. ambassador to France, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest conceded Monday. The words 'sorry' and 'apologize' didn't make cameos, but they have in the past, beginning just a few months into Obama's presidency. After comparing his awkward style of bowling to handicapped athletes who compete in the Special Olympics in March 2009, Obama called Special Olympics Chairman Tim Shriver to apologize personally. He made the comment on 'The Tonight Show,' and offered his mea culpa in the evening before the show even aired. Obama had told host Jay Leno that he was embarrassed after he scored just 129 on the White House's private bowling alley. 'It's like – it was like Special Olympics or something,' he said. Then-Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters the next day that Obama understood special olympians 'deserve a lot better than – than the thoughtless joke that he made last night, and he apologizes for that.' A more recent Obama slight brought a different kind of apology after his golf game in Hawaii forced an engaged military couple to move their wedding at the last minute. The bride's sister said it was 'emotional, especially for her – she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned.' Ultimately, she said, Obama called personally for a 'wonderful talk' and 'apologized and congratulated them.' On the world stage, the president has apologized to at least two heads of state. Following an incident in 2012 where American NATO troops were caught burning Qu'rans in Afghanistan, Obama apologized to that country's then-president, Hamid Karzai. The apology rankled some in the U.S. since violent protests after the holy-book burnings resulted in the deaths of two American soldiers. The Qu'rans had been confiscated from Muslim prisoners on a U.S. military base because it was feared they were using the books to pass information to each other. The soldiers failed to follow Army regulations covering the proper disposal of religious books. And in October 2013 German Chancellor Angela Merkel got a personal apology from Obama after it emerged that the National Security Agency had tapped her cell phone, beginning in 2002. He offered his hat-in-hand confession when Merkel called him – most likely on a land line – to discuss the unusual breach of trust. 'ENTSCHULDIGUNG': Obama apologized to German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the NSA tapped her phone . His fellow Democrats have had a few presidential admissions of guilt. California Attorney General Kamala Harris, now on the short list of likely Democratic contenders for the Senate seat soon to be vacated by Barbara Boxer, had hers in November 2013. Obama found himself behind the feminist 8-ball when he complimented Harris on her beauty. 'GOOD LOOKING': California Attorney General Kamala Harris was offended by a presidential compliment, and got an Obama mea culpa . 'She is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you'd want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,' the president said during a Democratic fundraiser in San Francisco. 'She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney general in the country. It's true! C'mon!' Jay Carney, then the White House Press Secretary, told reporters the next day that Obama 'did speak with Attorney General Harris last night, after he came back from his trip, and he called her to apologize for the distraction created by his comments.' Two apologies have come from the president following the initial debacles related to his Affordable Care Act. After Obama made at least 37 public promises that Americans who liked their medical insurance would be able to keep it under Obamacare, the opposite turned out to be true. Millions of Americans found themselves with canceled insurance policies. In November 2013, Obama apologized – but gave no quarter in insisting that the policy move forward as planned. 'I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,' he said during a television interview. His more heartfelt apology, though, was to Democrats who found his deception politically damaging. 'I feel deeply responsible,' he said during a White House press conference, 'for making it harder for them rather than easier for them to continue to promote the core values that I think led them to support this thing in the first place.'","US president has fallen on his sword more than a dozen times including apologies to the leaders of Germany and Afghanistan .

"The former bodyguard for Princess Diana has hit out against a new play suggesting that Prince Harry's real father is James Hewitt - but says that the prince will not care about the speculation. The West End production, believed to be endorsed by Mr Hewitt himself, has drawn criticism for its support of the rumours surrounding Harry's paternity, as well as a claim that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death. The princess' ex-minder, Ken Wharfe, has described the play Truth, Lies, Diana as 'tasteless', adding that there is no evidence to back up the allegations made by the production, which opened in London last Friday. Claims: A new play suggests that Prince Harry, left, is the son of former cavalry officer James Hewitt, right . Affair: The production claims Princess Diana began a relationship with Hewitt 18 months before Harry's birth . However, he said that Harry 'won't give a monkeys' about the repetition of claims that former cavalry officer Hewitt is his real father. 'Hewitt, actually, prior to this play has gone on record to say Harry isn't his son,' Mr Wharfe told the Daily Mirror. 'Harry knows exactly who he is and he's heard all this before. 'He won't give a monkeys about the play and won't see it. He will laugh it all off.' Rubbished: Bodyguard Ken Wharfe says that Prince Harry will not be concerned by the fresh speculation . The play, which was written by Jon Conway and is currently on at the Charing Cross Theatre, claims that Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other 18 months before the princess' second son was born in 1984. In one scene, the actor playing Hewitt says: 'Diana and I started our relationship more than a year before Harry was born. Now that doesn't prove that I am his father. It's just the inconvenient truth.' Hewitt has previously insisted that his affair with Diana started in 1986 - but he is friends with Mr Conway, and when asked about the play said he is 'sure that it is accurate'. The production also uses a notorious photograph of Prince Harry naked in a Las Vegas hotel room taken in 2012 - comparing it with a nude picture of Hewitt to reinforce the link between the two men. Mr Wharfe - who guarded Diana for seven years and later wrote a controversial memoir - told the Mirror: 'James Hewitt was captured naked, then 20-odd years later they tried to tie it up with Prince Harry in a hotel room in Las Vegas. 'What's the connection? Well there is no connection. It's totally tasteless, it has no relevance to this play at all.' Mr Conway told the Mail last year that he had spoken to Hewitt while researching the play, adding: 'I met him and he told me some quite remarkable things that have never been said in the public domain, particularly about when his relationship with Diana started. 'There is a startling revelation that James Hewitt makes and he has allowed me to make it in the play. This is the fact that his relationship with Diana started 18 months before Prince Harry was born.' Guard: Mr Wharfe is shown with Diana and her two sons as they left a restaurant together in April 1993 . Allegation: The play also claims that Diana was pregnant with the baby of her lover Dodi Al-Fayed, pictured with the princess on the night of their death . Theories: The new play is currently on at the Charing Cross Theatre in London's West End . He continued: 'We are not saying he is Prince Harry's father although the audience may take their own view on that. I don’t know if James Hewitt is Prince Harry's father and James Hewitt has always denied it either because it isn't true or out of some sense of loyalty.' Another extraordinary claim aired in Truth, Lies, Diana concerns the rumour that the princess was pregnant by her lover Dodi Al-Fayed at the time of the couple's death in a Paris car crash in 1997. A post-mortem examination showed that this was not the case - but in the play, a witness describes hearing one doctor being told that Diana had lost a baby in the crash which claimed her life. A scene shows the doctor on the phone saying, 'What? She was pregnant?' - then telling another character: 'Imagine that, the King of England's mother, pregnant with a Muslim baby.' Royal experts have rubbished the explosive claims made by the play, pointing out that there is no evidence to support them. Biographer Penny Junor told the Mail last year: 'I have spoken to people around at the time and they all say that James Hewitt wasn't in the picture before 1986.' And author Hugo Vickers added: 'If you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle. They have an agenda of their own.'","West End play Truth, Lies, Diana is believed to be backed by James Hewitt .

"The University of Virginia fraternity hit with allegations of gang rape in a Rolling Stone article will not be kicked off campus following a police investigation which turned up no evidence of the alleged sexual assault. Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, after Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year. All fraternities and sororities at the Charlottesville, Virginia campus were temporarily suspended in the wake of the controversial article, which provoked protests on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports. They're back: University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan has decided to let the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity remain on campus, after a police investigation yielded no evidence that a gang-rape happened at the house, as described in a November Rolling Stone article. The Phi Psi house pictured above after the story was published, as students gathered outside to protest sexual assault . However, the article later came into question when the Washington Post highlighted several discrepancies in the story - throwing doubt on whether the incident described by Jackie happened at Phi Psi, was orchestrated by a brother or even happened at all. Accuser: The Rolling Stone article featured a UVA junior named Jackie (above), who claimed to have been gang-raped by seven men at Phi Psi in 2012 . UVA President Teresa A Sullivan decided to allow end the fraternity's suspension after local police failed to find 'any substantive basis' to Jackie's claims. 'We welcome Phi Kappa Psi, and we look forward to working with all fraternities and sororities in enhancing and promoting a safe environment for all,' Sullivan said in a statement issued Monday, which marks the first day of the spring semester. Phi Psi's chapter President Stephen Scipione praised Sullivan's decision to re-open his fraternity. 'We are pleased that the University and the Charlottesville Police Department have cleared our fraternity of any involvement in this case,' Scipione said in a statement. 'In today’s 24-hour news cycle, we all have a tendency to rush to judgment without having all of the facts in front of us. As a result, our fraternity was vandalized, our members ostracized based on false information.' In the wake of the article, the fraternity was tagged with graffiti that read 'suspend us!' and 'UVA center for rape studies' and was the scene of mass protests. Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said his department is still investigating, but since they found no evidence of the assault, there was 'no reason to keep them suspended'. 'We welcome Phi Kappa Psi, and we look forward to working with all fraternities and sororities in enhancing and promoting a safe environment for all,' UVA President Teresa Sullivan said in a statement issued Monday, which marks the first day of the spring semester. Pictured above on June 26, 2012 . Phi Psi's reinstatement on campus means they will be able to hold parties at the house, and start new member recruitment - known as Rush - this semester. The fraternity's triumphant return to campus means they will no doubt be holding a party at the house this weekend, the first following winter break. If so, they will be holding the party under news rules instituted by the school in the aftermath of the scandal. These new rules include the banning of kegs and pre-made mixes of liquor at parties, and now requires beer to be served in closed can and wine to be poured in the open by a sober brother. Reviled: The Phi Kappa Psi house was tagged with graffiti in the aftermath of the article. The fraternity's president issued a statement on Monday saying: 'In today’s 24-hour news cycle, we all have a tendency to rush to judgment without having all of the facts in front of us. As a result, our fraternity was vandalized, our members ostracized based on false information' The campus's fraternities wrote the new guidelines themselves to help prevent the spread of date rape drugs, and Phi Psi was reportedly the first house to agree to the manifesto. Scipiano also said that he and the rest of the fraternity have undergone a sexual assault awareness program. 'We believe that in the midst of this ordeal, there is an opportunity for good,' Scipione said. 'This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in ensuring student safety.' The Rolling Stone article details the national issue of campus sexual assault, using UVA as a case study for how schools try to push these reports under the rug in order to protect the university's reputation. The story starts with Jackie's horrifying account of a date with a Phi Psi brother gone wrong. In the story, she claims she met a Phi Psi brother named Drew through her job at the campus pool and that he invited her to dinner and a date night at his fraternity just a few weeks after she started her freshman year in 2012. After dinner they returned to the frat, where he invited her upstairs for some time alone. But the date turned into a nightmare when she was smuggled into a dark room where a group of seven men proceed to rape her one by one for hours in what appears to have been an initiation ritual. Jackie said she passed out in the midst of the painful and traumatizing experience, and when she woke up she was alone and fled the house. She later met up with three friends - called Cindy, Andy and Randall in the article - who coldly weighed the pros and cons of reporting the incident to police,  fearing how it would impact their chances of getting into a frat and their social lives. Their side of the story: Three of the friends who comforted Jackie following the attack later came forward to identify themselves and reveal the fact that the Rolling Stone reporter never asked to interview them. They disputed several claims in the article . Just days after the story was published, Jackie's story began to unravel as the Washington Post found discrepancies in the article and her friends came forward with a very different account of events. Among the many issues revealed by the Post, was the fact that Jackie wasn't entirely sure what fraternity the rape happened at. She says found out the name of the house a year after the rape, when one of her friends pointed it out. The trio that helped Jackie the night of the rape, publicly came forward to identify themselves using their real names and said that the Rolling Stone reporter never even asked to interview them. If she had, they would have told her that Jackie's account of what happened at the fraternity was not the same as that reported in the article. 'Silence is violence': The article incited wide-spread protesting on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports . Though they believe something happened to her that night, the fact that her story has changed has led them to doubt her. Also, they said that on the night in question they insisted she talk to police and report the crime, but that she  refused and instead went to bed. In December, the fraternity issued a response to the story, saying no member of the fraternity was working at the pool at the time and that there was no event scheduled for the weekend Jackie says the incident happened. The avalanche of evidence calling into question Jackie' story caused Rolling Stone to apologize for the article. In their first apology, they said that their trust in Jackie had been misplaced, though they later edited that line out. The magazine has enlisted the help of the Columbia Journalism School to investigate their reporting process and what caused it to fail. (The school also named the story the worst piece of journalism for 2014.)","Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, following accusations of sexual assault published in a Rolling Stone article .

"Surgeons were forced to stop operating on a 'deceased' patient after discovering he was not brain dead. Doctors at a hospital in the Bremen area of Germany realised their patient was still technically alive after making an incision into his stomach. The team were due to harvest the man's organs for donation. But the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reports the operation was stopped as soon as the surgeons discovered their patient was not brain dead according to medical regulations. Surgeons operating to remove organs from a 'deceased' patient were forced to stop after discovering the man was not brain dead, according to medical regulations (file picture) An insider told the paper: 'It is quite possible that the man's brain was so damaged that he would not have been able to return to a normal life, but as long as he was not properly diagnosed as brain dead, nobody knows'.

Axel Rumia, director of the German Foundation for Organ Transplants, which reviews the accuracy of brain death diagnoses before organ donation, said the case it is of 'particular concern' that the diagnosis of brain death is 'performed with knowledge of medical science'. The GMA is also expected to investigate how doctors handled the discovery. Documents are said to state the operation was terminated due to the patient suffering cardiovascular failure. But investigators are now tasked with finding out if the patient's heart stopped by chance, or as a result of doctors changing oxygen levels when they discovered he may not be brain dead.

In fact, she said her fitness is often thanks to just 20 minutes of exercise a day. She said: 'I'm a big believer in doing 20 minutes of exercise a day. I love skipping with a rope because it's one of the hardest cardio exercises you can do, but it's so easy. I do three sets of three minutes; I'm always shocked at how sweaty I get.' She added in a separate interview with US Weekly that consistency is key to her maintaining her fabulous figure. She said people can't expect to have a body like hers unless they are prepared to make exercise a way of life - which doesn't mean it becomes all-consuming. She explains: 'I wouldn't say (I work out) a lot, just consistently. People think for some reason you have to work out for two and a half hours… but, it can be little. It can be 20 minutes, it could be 40 minutes. Keep fit: Kate will often do a mile run before a Pilates class . 'You can't do like two weeks and go like do two days and then take a week off and then do three days and then go, 'Why aren't I seeing results? I don't get it.' You know, you just got to do it - sad, like anything else in life!' She admits that like most people, she can struggle with motivation to work out so her key to success to get up and get it over and done with first thing. She said: 'I'm a morning person.

Explaining the benefits of Pilates, Nicole said: 'It primarily works your core, but not just the front. 'You'll work the entire body - front, sides, back, your whole midsection, trunk - it pulls everything in and together. 'You'll become tighter, more toned, and stronger. It makes you stand taller, makes you have more confidence, makes you more grounded. You'll lose inches and get that leaner, longer look. After the first 10 sessions, you'll feel different. After 20 sessions, you'll see a difference!' Kate has proved she's passionate about health and fitness and advocates everyone giving exercise a go, regardless of their current ability. She adds that women should not feel embarrassed about working out in public.

It doesn't matter what you do or where you come from, you just become a class and everybody's there supporting everybody, and you're all there for the same reason,' she said. The actress has founded the website Fabletics with the goal of getting more people active. Members of the site can gain access to fitness programmes and support from other users. She said: 'One of the reasons I love this company is that we are trying to make something affordable that could reach a demographic that don't necessarily have the means to go to a personal trainer every day, and to motivate people to just feel good in themselves. I think that all starts with being active.' Kate has also released an accompanying fashion range of fitness clothing which she says is functional and flattering for women of all shapes and sizes. As a mother to Bingham, ten, with ex-husband Chris Robinson. and Ryder, three, whose father, Matthew Bellamy, she split up with at the end of last year, Kate said getting the energy to exercise isn't always easy. So when she needs a good night's sleep, she calls on her mother Goldie Hawn to babysit. She revealed that diet is also an integral part of her health and wellbeing. 'Healthy food inspires me. It's important to know what you're eating because food is fuel, and we don't want to fuel our bodies in a way that could make them sick,' she said. But she added that she's not 'a health nut' as she'll tuck into M&Ms occasionally and loves to drink wine.

"China's bold plan to land a robotic spaceship on the moon and bring it back to Earth has moved another step forward. The service module of China's unmanned test lunar orbiter successfully entered an eight-hour orbit around the moon, state media reported. This brings it within 125 miles (200 km) of the lunar surface at its closest point, and out to a range of 3,293 miles (5,300 km) at its highest point. Scroll down for video . The service module of China's unmanned test lunar orbiter (artist's impression pictured) successfully entered an eight-hour orbit around the moon, state media reported . While the orbiter flew back to Earth in November, the service modules had been sitting in a position that brought in into sync with Earth's orbit, known as the second Lagrange point. The craft, loaded with support systems for operating a spaceship, will collect further data to aid planning of the 2017 Chang'e 5 mission, state broadcaster China Central Television said. Chang'e 5 is being designed to make a soft landing on the moon and collect at least 4lbs (2kg) of rock and soil samples before returning to Earth. If successful, that would make China only the third country after the United States and Russia to meet such a challenge.

China is also looking to mine the moon for the rare helium isotope that some scientists claim could meet global energy demand far into the future, according to a report in The Times. The lunar dirt brought back by mankind's first moonwalkers contained an abundance of titanium, platinum and other valuable minerals. But our satellite also contains a substance that could be of even greater use to civilisation – one that could revolutionise energy production. It's called helium 3 and has been dumped on the moon in vast quantities by solar winds. Now China is looking to mine the moon for the rare helium isotope that some scientists claim could meet global energy demand far into the future, according to a report in The Times. Professor Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, recently said, the moon is 'so rich' in helium 3, that this could 'solve humanity's energy demand for around 10,000 years at least.' Professor Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, recently said, the moon is 'so rich' in helium 3, that this could 'solve humanity's energy demand for around 10,000 years at least. Helium 3, scientists argue, could power clean fusion plants. It is nonradioactive and a very little goes a very long way. For instance, two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption. This would require mining an areas the size of Washington, D.C. The isotope is so rare on the Earth because our atmosphere and magnetic field prevent any of the solar helium 3 from arriving on the surface. The moon doesn't have this problem as there is nothing to prevent helium 3 being absorbed by the lunar soil. China's lunar exploration program has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes, and in 2013 landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard. None of those were designed to return to Earth. China also has hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, the only other country after Russia and the U.S. to achieve manned space travel independently. It also has launched a temporarily crewed space station. China's program has received Russian assistance, but has largely developed independently of America's, which is now in its sixth decade of putting people into space.

"The owner of a boa constrictor that frightened a public relations office when it slithered out of their toilet last week has come forward to apologize and claim his snake, though it will be going to a new home. The five-foot-long Columbian rainbow didn't stray far from home by lodging itself in the toilet at Vertical PR in San Diego. The snake's owner lives two floors up in the same building on G Street. The owner has not publicly identified himself, but has told the landlord and his neighbors that he assumed the snake escaped outside since his tank was near an open window. He had no idea it went elsewhere in the building. It's unknown how long the snake was missing, or if he reported it to animal control. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: Last Tuesday, this 5-foot-long boa constrictor popped out of the toilet in this San Diego, California PR firm, giving the employees in the office quite a fright. The following day, the snake's owner called animal control to claim it . Great neighbor: The snake's owner lived two floors up from Vertical PR in the same building in San Diego, California . Feisty: The owner will be taking his Columbian rainbow boa to live at a friend's house. The snake has been aggressive while in animal control's custody, nipping one handler on the wrist . Though he will face no consequences for the incident, the snake's owner has decided to relocate the boa to a new home. 'The tenant and I agreed the snake would be better at his friend’s house,' landlord Jason Zana told U-T San Diego. 'It was his idea first, and I agreed.' Zana said his mixed-use building is pet friendly and that he never had a specific clause about snakes before. However, he says he's thinking of implementing a new rule in the aftermath of the terrifying incident. The women at the PR firm have been incredibly understanding about the accident, despite the fright the boa gave them. 'I'm not upset. I think we can have a good chuckle over it, honestly,' Vertical PR partner Holly Wells told NBC. 'My partner, Stephanie, who's terrified of snakes, might think a little bit differently. But I think it's all fun and games.' Holly's partner Stephanie Lacsa was the first person to encounter the snake at their office in the Old City Hall building last Tuesday. Interesting day at work: Vertical PR partner Stephanie Lacsa (left) was the first to see the snake last week, as she was trying to plunge their mysteriously clogged toilet. She saw the snake's tongue and ran out of the bathroom, taping the door shut before telling partner Holly Well (right) about the invader . Facebook: Wells took to Facebook to describe the experience saying 'Happy New Years to us' The office toilet had been clogging up, and when Lacsa went to use a plunger, she saw the snake peak it's head out of the siphon. 'I thought my eyes were deceiving me,' Lasca said of the moment she saw the snake's tongue flicker in the toilet. Lacsa screamed and ran from the bathroom, taping the door shut before she called animal services, FOX news reports. An animal services employee arrived to find the Columbian rainbow boa curled up behind the toilet. The animal services employee was even shocked, telling NBC the situation was 'the stuff of urban legends.' Animal Services Deputy Director Dan DeSousa told NBC that when in the care of animal services, the snake got 'nippy' and bit its handler. The snake's owner came forward to claim the pet the next day. Since the snake is molting, it's believed it slithered into the sink to soak his skin for the shedding process.

"A happy childhood means healthier hearts and circulation in adulthood, new research found. Children brought up in a loving home who do not go without, eat healthier foods, have friends and have learnt to control their aggression and impulsiveness have better cardiovascular health in later life than deprived children. The Finnish study found those with 'favourable psychosocial experiences' gained additional advantages that saw them through as adults. The study published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation found participants with the most psychosocial advantages in youth scored higher on an ideal cardiovascular health index in adulthood than those with the least psychosocial advantage (file photo) These included a 14 per cent greater chance of being at normal weight as an adult, a 12 per cent greater chance of being a non-smoker and 11 per cent greater chance to have a healthy glucose level. Dr Laura Pulkki-Råback at the University of Helsinki said: 'The choices parents make have a long-lasting effect on their children's future health, and improvement in any one thing can have measurable benefits. 'For instance, if an unemployed parent gets steady employment, the effect may be huge. 'If he or she also quits smoking, the benefit is even greater. All efforts to improve family well-being are beneficial.' The study published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation found participants with the most psychosocial advantages in youth scored higher on an ideal cardiovascular health index in adulthood than those with the least psychosocial advantages. It involved 3,577 children aged from three to 18 and measured their socioeconomic status, emotional stability, parental health behaviours, stressful events, self-regulation of behavioural problems and social adjustment. The Finnish study found those with 'favourable psychosocial experiences' gained additional advantages that saw them through as adults. These included a 14 per cent greater chance of being at normal weight as an adult and a 12 per cent greater chance of being a non-smoker (file photo) Of the group, researchers assessed 1,089 of the participants 27 years later when they were aged between 30 and 45 to determine their level of ideal cardiovascular health. It found favourable socioeconomic status and self-regulatory behaviour, meaning good aggression and impulse control, in childhood were the strongest predictors of ideal cardiovascular health in adulthood. The study also highlighted the importance of early life stages - periods during which other studies have proven cardiovascular diseases begin to root. Dr Pulkki-Råback added: 'Scientific evidence supports the fact that investing in the well-being of children and families will be cost effective in the long run because it decreases healthcare costs at the other end of life. 'The knowledge is out there, and now it is a question of values and priorities.'","Kids with 'favourable psychosocial experiences' gained advantages that carried on through adulthood, a Finnish study found .

"A historic castle complete with its own watchtower, 14th century ruins and resident ghost has gone on sale for less than the price of an average semi-detached home in London. Blenkinsopp Castle in Greenhead, Northumberland is on the market for just £325,000 despite boasting four bedrooms, two reception rooms, and the chance to own a piece of history. While interior pictures show what could be any family home, views from the outside show the castle's turreted walls and stone masonry. Scroll down for video . On the market: Belnkinsopp Castle, which comes complete with its own watchtower, 14th century ruins and resident ghost, has gone on sale for less than the price of an average semi-detached home in London . King of the castle: The Castle in Greenhead, Northumberland is on the market for just £325,000 despite boasting four bedrooms, two reception rooms, and the chance to own a piece of history . Sense of history: Included in the price are a set of 14th century medieval ruins that could have come straight from the set of a Hollywood film . Heritage: The castle was built in 1399 by the Blenkinsopp family, and has been used as a family home for centuries . According to Rightmove, the average price of a semi-detached home in London is £522,248, meaning homeowners who wanted to swap the city for the rolling countryside of Northumberland would come away with nearly £200,000 in change. And included in the knock-down price are a set of 14th century medieval ruins that could have come straight from the set of a Hollywood film. Built by the Blenkinsopp family in 1339, the Castle - which is around a mile from Hadrian's Wall - has served as a family home for centuries, while a hotel was added to it by William Lyle Blenkinsopp Coulson in the 1880s. It comes complete with a Pele tower - a type of fortified watchtower that was added in the 19th century and is nestled in a tiny hamlet of 70 homes. Look out: The castle comes complete with a Pele tower - a type of fortified watchtower that was added in the 19th century and is nestled in a tiny hamlet of 70 homes . Members of the ancient Blenkinsopp family are said to have first taken possession of the land on which the castle was built prior to the Norman conquest. After the invasion, when land was shared out amongst the Normans no one wanted this particular area so the sitting tenant, Blencan, was allowed to keep it. The land is thought to have once been known as 'Blencan's Hope', meaning valley. A Randolph de Blenkinsopp was recorded in the Pipe Rolls of Northumberland as owning land in the Haltwhistle area in 1240, and it is thought that he lived in a fortified manor house. The castle is thought to have been built in 1339, and historical documents show that Thomas de Blecansopp was given a licence to crenellate, or fortify, the property in 1340. One of the family's medieval patriots, Bryan de Blenkinsopp, who held the castle some 600 years ago, was said to have a lust for wealth, and married a French woman who was plain, but possessed a chest of gold so heavy it took 12 men to carry it. However, she would not tell Sir Bryan where she and her servants had hidden it, eventually causing him to quit the castle, leaving her behind. Legend has it that, tortured by her actions, she was doomed to haunt the castle, and is known as the White Lady. Members of the Blenkinsopp family lived in the castle for several centuries, but when it began to decay in the 16th century they left for their other properties at nearby Bellister Castle, near Haltwhistle, and Dryburnhaugh, near Greenhead. By 1727 the castle was in ruins, and at around this time the Coulson family from Jesmond took ownership of the estate through marriage. A new house was built on the site in the 1830s and the castle was rebuilt between 1877 and 1880 as a mansion, before it became a hotel. The building burned down in 1954 and although it was rebuilt, some of the ruins attached to the house had to be demolished as they were unsafe. The castle even has its own ghost, and is said to be haunted by the widow of money-hungry Bryan de Blenkinsopp, who left her when she refused to tell him where she had buried her treasure chest. The chest was never found and The White Lady is still said to roam the corridors. Despite being ravaged by a fire in 1954 when it was a guest house and having to be partly demolished, the castle has been lovingly restored and is now a Grade II listed imposing house fit for a lord or lady. Hidden comfort: From the inside the castle, which boasts this large castle, could be any well-appointed family home . Room with a view: The occupants of this bedroom, one of four in the castle, can wake up to views across the Northumberland countryside . A place to rest: The castle has two living rooms, including this one which also boasts views of the rolling countryside . Facilities: The castle has two bathrooms, one of which is an en-suite, and is described as a 'beautiful and practical family home' 'It’s an incredible property,' said Ailsa Mather from estate agent Andrew Coulson. 'The history of the place alone makes it worth the very ordinary price as well as the fact that it’s a beautiful and practical family home. 'I’m expecting a flurry of viewings as soon as people see what an amazing opportunity it is to own and live in a castle.' Put your feet up: The castle's large sitting room has ample space to sit back and relax in front of a roaring fire .

"It is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) will take America to deep space - and blazed through its first successful test at Nasa's Stennis Space Centre near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The RS-25, formerly the space shuttle main engine, fired up for 500 seconds on the A-1 test stand at Stennis, providing NASA engineers critical data on the engine controller unit and inlet pressure conditions. Scroll down for video . Four RS-25 engines will power SLS on future missions, including to an asteroid and Mars. The SLS system will use four of the giant rockets when it blasts off to deep space . There will be two versions of the rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. This is the first hot fire of an RS-25 engine since the end of space shuttle main engine testing in 2009. Four RS-25 engines will power SLS on future missions, including to an asteroid and Mars. Scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017, the SLS is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs. The initial flight-test configuration will provide a 77-ton capacity, and the final evolved two-stage configuration will provide a lift capability of more than 143 tons. The rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station, and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system. 'The potential use of SLS for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'SLS has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos.' Nasa has made major modification to the shuttle engines for its new role. 'We've made modifications to the RS-25 to meet SLS specifications and will analyze and test a variety of conditions during the hot fire series,' said Steve Wofford, manager of the SLS Liquid Engines Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, where the SLS Program is managed. 'The engines for SLS will encounter colder liquid oxygen temperatures than shuttle; greater inlet pressure due to the taller core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and their position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles.' How big the rocket is: Nasa's new SLS dwarfs the Saturn V in terms of thrust - and the larger version will also dwarf it is size. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration of the SLS will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Testing will resume in April after upgrades are completed on the high pressure industrial water system, which provides cool water for the test facility during a hot fire test. Eight tests, totaling 3,500 seconds, are planned for the current development engine. Another development engine later will undergo 10 tests, totaling 4,500 seconds. The second test series includes the first test of new flight controllers, known as green running. The first flight test of the SLS will feature a configuration for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit to test the performance of the integrated system. The first flight test of the SLS will feature a configuration for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit to test the performance of the integrated system. As the SLS is upgraded, it will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons) to enable missions even farther into our solar system. Nasa has signed a $2.8 billion contract with Boeing to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space. 'Our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the Space Launch System (SLS) – the largest ever - will be built safely, affordably and on time,' said Virginia Barnes, Boeing SLS vice president and program manager. 'We are passionate about NASA's mission to explore deep space. 'It's a very personal mission, as well as a national mandate.' This milestone marks NASA's first CDR on a deep-space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961, when the Saturn V rocket underwent a similar design review as the United States sought to land an astronaut on the moon. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . Currently under construction, NASA's Space Launch System will be the world's most powerful launch vehicle. Designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations, including an asteroid and Mars, SLS is working toward a first launch in 2017. For that first flight test, the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons (77 tons) of payload into low-Earth orbit, almost three times what the space shuttle could carry. From there, SLS will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons (143 tons), more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry. 'While many people think of the Space Launch System in terms of human exploration, SLS could have a wide application in a lot of other areas, including space science,' said Steve Creech, assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for SLS. 'For missions to the outer planets, for example, SLS could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible, such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times.' Nasa's previous rockets, the Saturn, Shuttle and right, the smaller configuration of the new SLS . Agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft, such as the Europa Clipper, a proposed mission to one of Jupiter's icy moons, on the SLS rocket, and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system's outer planets, rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed, reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles. In the case of the Europa Clipper, for example, the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles. 'For as long as people have been launching rockets into space, mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width,' Creech said. The pieces that make up Nasa's mega-rocket in its first configuration . 'Depending on how large you make it, it can only go so fast, which in some cases limits where you can go. 'Today, if you want to send a mission to the outer planets, you have to be able to make it fit within that box. With SLS, we're about to make that box much larger. 'With the space shuttle, for example, we were able to launch missions like NASA's Hubble Space Telescope that were about the size of a school bus. 'With SLS, you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried Hubble. 'It's going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions.' 'The Space Launch System could be really game-changing for space science,' said ACO manager Reggie Alexander. 'For some missions, it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out. 'A Mars sample return mission, for example, could be flown using only one rocket instead of three. 'But for other destinations, SLS lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of Saturn's moon Enceladus.'","Construction of the Space Launch System has already begun .
Rocket will eventually be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds .
Will be powered by four RS-25 engines - previously used to send space shuttle into orbit .

"An expat benefit cheat who swindled £60,000 from British taxpayers has been ordered to repay just £1 - because his house is in Spain is in his wife's name. Jimmy Rickner was branded a 'financial parasite' by a judge after claiming to be a penniless pensioner in Britain when in fact he was married and living abroad. He claimed pension credit and disability living allowance for eight years by lying about where he lived and his marital status. Rickner had said he was living on his own in Exeter, Devon, when he was actually living in Cartagena and Almeria. Jimmy Rickner claimed to be a single penniless pensioner living in Exeter, when he was actually married and living in Cartagena, pictured, and Almeria in Spain . The false addresses were actually owned by his wife's daughter. The 73-year-old was jailed for six months last year but returned to Exeter Crown Court for a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing. There, he was told he must pay just £1 after his publicly-funded barrister told the judge he had no recoverable assets and the £80,000 villa where he lives in Spain is in his wife's name. The court heard Rickner married Jennifer Wicks in 2005. Within months, the couple had sold her house in Exeter, making a £191,000 profit, which they used to start a new life in Spain. Recorder Mr Nicholas Hall told the court Rickner had benefited by £60,353.58 from crime - but there were no available assets to seize. He added the Crown will be able to pursue Rickner for the money if he ever returns to Britain and has assets of his own. He said: 'If Rickner were to return to this country to take advantage of our wonderful NHS, the prosecution could have another go in the future. 'This is not an attractive position for the court to adopt and frankly one has the feeling the Rickners have done rather well in the way they have managed things. 'The court is presented with a dilemma. In plain terms, Rickner has ended up with no assets and his wife with a property in Almeria. 'It leaves the court a most unsatisfactory position. Rickner has enjoyed the benefit of accommodation for a considerable period of time. 'It is accepted by the Crown there is no prospect of a finding being made against him which can be enforced. 'I have taken some time to explain this order because sometimes these things are controversial and difficult for the public to accept. I have expressed my own concern that the court has been left in this position.' The Recorder explained that Spanish property laws are different from those in Britain, meaning that as a husband Rickner has no stake in the house in Almeria because it is solely in his wife's name. He said even if the couple were to split up and return to Britain he would have very little claim on the proceeds of the sale of the Exeter house in 2006 because it had been his wife's property and was sold shortly after they married. The 73-year-old was jailed for six months last year but returned to Exeter Crown Court. pictured, for a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing . James Taghdissian, prosecuting, said it is accepted the only tangible assets now remaining are the house in Almeria, which is in the sole name of Mrs Rickner. He said the amount which Rickner obtained by benefit fraud was £48,000 but the figure had been increased to £60,000 through the addition of interest. Lisa Hennessy, defending, said the couple had lost money on their first home in Spain and then moved to their current address, where the current valuation is also less than the 105,000 Euros (£82,000) Mrs Rickner paid in 2010. She said Rickner has no realizable assets in his own name and said the only option open to the court was a nominal order to pay £1. At his original hearing Judge Barry Cotter, QC, told Rickner: 'You were a financial parasite who lied repeatedly. 'The public view dishonesty of this sort at a time of financial austerity as behaviour which demands and calls for significant punishment.'","Jimmy Rickner was branded a 'financial parasite' and jailed for six months .

"George Zimmerman, pictured in a mug shot taken on Saturday, allegedly threw a bottle at his girlfriend . George Zimmerman became so enraged when his girlfriend tried to break up with him that he threw a wine bottle at her head, according to a police report about his latest arrest. The wine bottle did not hit the woman, who fled the house in her car and was later pulled over by officers who had seen her leaving the home. Zimmerman has denied throwing the bottle and disputed another claim that he had destroyed her cell phone, according to the report, which chronicles his latest run-in with police since he was acquitted of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2013. The former neighborhood watch volunteer was arrested Friday in Lake Mary, Florida and charged with aggravated assault in the January 5 incident. He was released Saturday on $5,000 bond. In the report, officers said they had been patrolling the neighborhood where Zimmerman lives when they heard the sound of glass shattering, and saw the former girlfriend drive out of the driveway. They pulled her over for a traffic stop a few streets over because she didn't have her lights on. She explained that Zimmerman became angry after she told him she didn't want to take the relationship further. She added that they argued over a painting she had that he wanted returned. Zimmerman made threats and threw the wine bottle, which didn't hit her, she said. In court: Zimmerman, 31, is pictured wearing handcuffs during his first appearance at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida on Saturday after he was charged with aggravated assault with a weapon . Denial: Zimmerman denied throwing the bottle at the unidentified woman's head. She told police they had fought after she broke up with him and he demanded she give back a painting that he owned . When detectives found her inside the car, she was 'extremely emotional, crying, mad and upset' and called her former boyfriend 'that psycho, George Zimmerman'. She said she should have known better than to get involved with him. The ex-girlfriend, whose name is redacted, told investigators that she had had an 'intimate relationship' with Zimmerman since the end of last year. 'She indicated that this began at a time when she was emotionally vulnerable,' the report said. But the officers added that she became reluctant to cooperate when she realized that officers might be conducting an investigation. Zimmerman was arrested at his house on Friday, four days after the confrontation. Detectives said in the police report that he refused to come to the door for more than two hours despite their repeated knocking. They said they could hear the television on and a dog barking. Zimmerman eventually came outside after police officers agreed to allow him to keep his attorney on his cell phone with him while he was interviewed, the report said. Fights: Shellie Zimmerman (left) and Samantha Scheibe (right) have both claimed and retracted accusations of abuse. The woman in the latest incident said she should have known better than to go out with him . Speaking to officers, he insisted he was only trying to prevent her from entering his home. Before he was released, he was also told by the judge to stay out of Volusia County, where the woman lives. The judge ordered Zimmerman to pack up any personal belongings his girlfriend may have left at Zimmerman's home and give them to his lawyer. He is scheduled to appear back in court on February 17. After the arrest, his attorney Don West admitted his client 'has not been lucky with the ladies.' Both his ex-wife, Shellie Zimmerman, and his ex-girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, called 911 to accuse him of domestic violence. Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013 of a second-degree murder charge for shooting Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. The Justice Department has yet to say whether it will file federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who said he shot Martin in self-defense during a confrontation in February 2012. Relatives of Martin accused Zimmerman of racially profiling the teen. November 2013: He was arrested on charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief after his then-girlfriend said he pointed a gun at her face during an argument, smashed her coffee table and pushed her out of the house they shared. Samantha Scheibe decided not to cooperate with detectives and prosecutors didn't pursue the case. September 2012: He then was accused by his estranged wife of smashing an iPad during an argument at the home they had shared. Shellie Zimmerman initially told a dispatcher her husband had a gun, though she later said he was unarmed. No charges were ever filed because of a lack of evidence. The dispute occurred days after Shellie Zimmerman filed divorce papers. Zimmerman has also been pulled over three times for traffic violations since his acquittal .","George Zimmerman was arrested on Friday after the unidentified woman told police officers that the 31-year-old threw a bottle at her - but missed .

"A Delta airlines flight from Cleveland to New York City was so badly delayed that by the time it took off there were only two passengers left to get on board. The scheduled 7:15am service from Ohio to New York's LaGuardia airport was hit by delay after delay throughout Monday, and didn't take off until around 6pm that evening. By that time almost everybody had been moved to other flights - at one point leaving just one man on board the service with a full flight crew, who gave him a personal in-flight safety drill.

Quiet ride: O'Leary appreciated the flight for its lack of loud music and screaming children. He also had a whole flight crew to himself, one of whom took this photograph . Chris O'Leary, a media strategist from Brooklyn, was told of the ongoing delays by text, so waited in his hotel until the flight was finally ready to leave. In the mean time, other passengers who had gone to the airport were booked onto different New York-bound flights, ABC News reported. O'Leary was almost the only passenger on the flight, but another man arrived to board seconds before the plane turned down the runway. The other man slept for the length of the plane journey, making for a very quiet ride. O'Leary told ABC: 'It was definitely the most memorable flight I've been on in recent memory...

"Just one month after Skype unveiled the ability to translate conversations between Spanish and English in real time, Google has announced its own voice translation service. The mobile translation app will automatically recognise speech in a number of widely-spoken languages to translate it into text in a user’s native language. The move builds on Google's Translate feature, which offers written translation of 90 languages as well as enabling people to hear spoken translations in a handful of languages. Google is tipped to extend its Google Translate app (logo pictured) by adding a feature that automatically recognises speech in a number of popular languages and translates conversation into text in a user's native language, potentially making awkward mis-communication problems on holiday, a thing of the past . The Android app will let people converse in different languages, offering a running commentary on what is being said on the screen of a smartphone or computer,The New York Times reported. When the update will be rolled out and how the technology works is unknown, but MailOnline has contacted Google for comment. Google told the newspaper that its Translate app has been installed 100 million times on Android handsets and that most of these apps will get the speech update. Macduff Hughes, the engineering director of Google Translate said: ‘We have 500 million active users of Translate every month, across all our platforms.’ Users of Google's text translate service which works with 140 languages will be familiar with this screen, but the new app will let people converse in different languages by offering a running commentary on what is being said, instead of a quick translattion in a 'box' Rumours of the Google update come a month after Microsoft released a preview of Skype Translator (shown). It lets people of different languages talk to each other on video calls. The software translates Spanish or English into text and speech, using a Windows 8.1 device . Word Lens uses augmented reality to translate text including road signs, menus, newspapers, and more by pointing a phone’s camera towards it. Supported languages include Russian, Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese. Google bought the technology by acquiring California-based developers Quest Visual in May last year. 'With Word Lens, we've seen the beginnings of what's possible when we harness the power of mobile devices to 'see the world in your language,' the firm said. 'By joining Google, we can incorporate Quest Visual's technology into Google Translate's broad language coverage and translation capabilities in the future' Available on iOS, Android and Google Glass, users choose the language they want to translate to and from, before holding a camera up to text, such as a road sign or menu. Word Lens automatically translates the text and overlays it on the same image on the phone's display. He believes that because 80 to 90 per cent of the web is written in 10 languages, being able to interpret different languages is a critical learning tool for millions of people. Google will also launch a freshly branded app that translates foreign text into a user’s native language using a smartphone camera. The ability to do this already exists via an app called Word Lens, whose parent company, Quest Visual, was acquired by Google in May 2014. Users can hover their smartphone camera in front of text – a street sign for example - to see a translation magically appear on their screen. Last month, Microsoft's Skype released a beta version of its live translation tool, which translates speech instantly into both text and spoken translations. While it currently only interprets between English and Spanish, it will eventually offer 40 languages, which will mean people from different countries will be able to converse with ease. ‘Skype is now removing another barrier to make it possible for people to communicate irrespective of what language they speak,’ Microsoft’s Gurdeep Pall wrote in a blog post. ‘Skype Translator relies on machine learning, which means that the more the technology is used, the smarter it gets.’ Initial reports from Skype's beta version (shown) say it is good, although not perfect. ‘For Skype Translator to work properly, there is a little mental conditioning involved,’ reported Gizmodo. They say you need to speak slowly, and now 'um' or 'ah' too much . ‘We are starting with English and Spanish, and as more people use the Skype Translator preview with these languages, the quality will continually improve.’ Initial reports about Skype's beta version say it is good, but not perfect. ‘For Skype Translator to work properly, there is a little mental conditioning involved,’ reported Gizmodo. ‘For one, you must speak slowly. Skype Translator's speech recognition is good, and plenty fast, but that accuracy decreases as you speed up in words per minute. ‘""Hey, how is it going?"" can change to ""Hey is going?"" pretty quickly.’ It’s also recommended that the speaker doesn’t ‘um’ and ‘ah’ too much, as this can confuse the translation tool. A breakthrough by the Skype and Microsoft Translator teams in neural network-based speech recognition reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent, meaning that it is more accurate than ever before. Google will also launch a freshly branded app that translates foreign text into a user’s native language using a smartphone camera. The ability to do this already exists via an app called Word Lens, in which users instantly see a translated sign, for example (pictured), on the screen of their phone .

"Two cars in U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's motorcade have been involved in a crash in India. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the collision happened as Mr Kerry's motorcade was heading to the airport in Ahmedabad. Mr Kerry's vehicle was one of those caught up in the crash, but there were no injuries. The crash resulted in some damage to both cars, one of which was substituted, and the motorcade continued its journey to the airport. Mr Kerry was in Ahmedabad for a long-scheduled appearance at an international investment conference and to prepare for President Barack Obama's trip to India later this month. Crumpled: One of the two cars from John Kerry's convoy that were involved in a crash while the Secretary of State was being escorted to the airport in Ahmedabad during his tour of India . Escaped unhurt: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry walks out of the Vibrant Gujarat summit in Gandhinagar, India, hours before he was caught up in a car crash on the way to the airport in Ahmedabad . In a statement, Psaki said: 'During the drive to the airport in Ahmedabad, India, two cars in the motorcade had a minor traffic accident resulting in some damage to both cars. 'Secretary Kerry was in the first of the two vehicles. He sustained no injuries nor did any staff or personnel. 'One vehicle was switched out and the motorcade proceeded to the airport without further incident.' Clarifying, Psaki told reporters on Kerry's plane that he did not get out of his car and that the vehicle switched out was the one behind him. Earlier, John Kerry confirmed he would now travel to Paris after the U.S. government was shamed for not joining a rally yesterday for victims of the French terror attacks attended by 40 world leaders and a million people. It came as a staggering 3.7million people gathered across France today to stage further defiant marches in a moving tribute to the 17 people killed in hostage sieges last week. The Secretary of State said at a news conference that U.S. officials, including himself and President Barack Obama, had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities almost immediately after the first attack occurred and had offered intelligence assistance. The car was left at the roadside and replaced before the motorcade continued its journey to the airport . Diplomatic mission: Mr Kerry (centre) was in Ahmedabad for a long-scheduled appearance at an international investment conference and to prepare for President Barack Obama's trip to India later this month . As to criticism about the lack of a senior official at Sunday's March, Kerry said: 'I really think that this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched. 'As everybody knows, I have been here in India for a prior planned event,' he added. 'I would have personally very much wanted to have been there but couldn't do so because of the commitment that I had here and it is important to keep these kinds of commitments.' He said as soon as he heard about the march, he asked his team what the earliest time was that he could go. While in Paris, Kerry will be meeting with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and pay tribute to the victims of last week's attacks, which killed 17 people. Kerry is a fluent French speaker, has a well-known affinity for France and has visited Paris more than a dozen times since becoming secretary of state. Kerry will arrive in Paris on Thursday after stops in Sofia, Bulgaria and Geneva, Switzerland.","Crash caused damage to two cars in convoy, one of which was replaced .

A recent snowfall in the middle eastern country saw Saudis eagerly building snowmen and even snow camels . Mohammed Saleh Al Minjed decreed that building snowmen – or indeed creating any living creature out of snow – was an insult to the Islamic religion . He declared that inanimate objects such as ships and buildings could be imitated – or food – but not animals, according to Gulf News. He wrote: 'God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on.' The fatwa - or religious ruling - was given a frosty reception on social media sites by some people. Blogger Mishaal complained that the ruling took the joy out of the unusual weather.

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year. Last year the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment (GAIAE) in the UAE issued a fatwa against living on Mars. The committee argued that an attempt to dwell on the planet would be so hazardous as to be suicidal and killing oneself is not permitted by Islam. The astronauts, the committee said, would end up dying for no 'righteous reason' and would face the same punishment in the afterlife as someone who'd committed suicide. The GAIAE has issued around two million Fatwas through its Official Fatwa Centre since its inception in 2008. In Malaysia, meanwhile, Muslim clerics have issued fatwas banning everything from yoga to Valentines Day in a bid to stop the influence of Western culture. To ensure Muslims can keep pace with the rules, an 'e-fatwa' site has been started the Globalpost reports. The issue recently came to a head at a dog-petting festival for Muslims, with the organiser receiving threatening phone calls. Muslims are taught that canines are unclean. Malaysian activist Zainah Anwar, recently wrote that Muslims are 'sick and tired of being told, yet again, of more categories of Muslims and practices to be denounced, hated and declare deviant'. Her women's rights group, Sisters in Islam, has also been targeted. It was issued with a fatwa for pushing 'liberalism'. It had pushed for Muslim women to be able to enter beauty pageants. The group were challenging the ruling. The list of fatwas now includes, Halloween, which is said to be too Christian and black metal because it is 'powerful enough to force a Muslim to forsake his faith'. Botox is banned, but can be used if medically necessary.","Recent snow in Saudi Arabia saw Saudis eagerly building snowmen .

"A disgruntled woman is selling her ex-husband's Porsche for a measly $20,000 as payback for him cheating on her so she can have her own fun with men on a European jaunt. The jilted woman from Templestowe, in Melbourne's northeast, placed an advertisement titled - Ex-husbands precious Porsche 911 - on the Revenge Sales website with the justification behind her vindictive plan. 'I have been married to this unfaithful poor excuse for a human being for over 25 years and yes we are wealthy,' she firstly pointed out about the 2010 Carrera 997 model that is worth about $150,000. Woman advertises the sale of her ex-husband's 2010 Porsche 911 Carrera 997 for $20,000 for being unfaithful . The daring woman then went onto explain how she discovered her man, that she had committed to for quarter of a century, was doing the dirty. 'I had hunches that my husband was cheating so I followed him out on what he said was a 'guys poker night' to find him at a 5 star restaurant cuddling up to this young blonde woman (cliché),' the ad says. 'So to pay him back, as I have rightful ownership of his precious Porsche, I have decided to sell it for a specific price of $20,000.' And she ends the post with the clincher on how she plans to spend the money. 'I figured $20,000 is just enough for a return flight/accommodation to Europe so I can fondle with all the wealthy European men!' The jilted ex-wife plans to spend the money on a European holiday to' fondle' all of the wealthy European men . The advertisement naturally caused some colourful responses from interested buyers of both the sports car and its female owner. 'It's a bit of a ride from the east coast of the USA, but if your offer is legit, I'll be happy to make the trip, respect and pay your $20K asking price, and take you to dinner,' Greg posted. 'ill [sic] come pick it up now and ill take you too if you want but seriously ill come buy it now,' Jayden said. The lucky woman already has a place to stay in France on her European trip . 'I'm happy to give you $20000 in cash and a free accommodation in Paris, Amath offered. The ballsy move of the woman was praised by some on the revenge sales site who could empathise after going through a similar experience. 'YOU GO GIRL!!!:)YOU KICK HIS ASS.YOU ARE WOMAN,.......WE HEAR YOU ROAR;)' Ash said. 'Good on you. This would make a great present for myself as my wife I found out has been doing the same. Think I need to treat myself. Please email me,' Damien said. 'I am not rich but also went through the exact same thing with my first husband who was cheating on me with any woman that would give him the time of day,' Karen posted. 'What I can never figure out is why these men get married to be in a committed relationship if they do not plan on staying committed. 'I applaud you for hitting him where it hurts the most, which is his wallet! I wish you all the best, and the sooner you get away from this two timer, the better your life will be!!!!! :)' The ad attracted some responses by people asking out the woman while others empathised with her situation . While there were others who doubted the post was a legitimate advertisement. 'More like a bogus ad to draw crowds to this site. Try finding another Porsche or Mercedes or anything on here lol why wouldn't this be on carsales and why doesn't it have KM's or a rego plate? Surely with the unbelievable low k's it should still have number plates,' one person questioned. 'I see you removed the plates for the photos, you must know what you are doing.... I call BS on this, so many things don't add up,' Jacques says. 'Is this for real??? I suppose that you have had a heap of people chasing this up but keen to learn more,' David said. 'I walked in on my now ex wife ""on the job"" so to speak.' While another doubter aptly called 'Really' with the following reply. 'ya'll still think this is real / even if it was the car has been sold. STOP DREAMING! LOL.' While other people even doubted that the post was a legitimate advertisement on the Revenge Sales website .","Woman sells ex-husband's porsche for $20,000 as payback for cheating .

"An experimental U.S. penny struck to test a design in 1792 sold at auction for almost $2.6 million - and the man with the winning bid also spent approximately $2.2 million on a quarter from the same year, it has emerged. It has been reported that the man spent around $4.8 million for his two coins. Heritage Auctions in Dallas said the 1792 penny sold Thursday for $2,585,000 to a California man. A Heritage official says the coin is called the 'Birch cent' after engraver Robert Birch. The official calls it the 'finest' of only about 10 known surviving examples of the pennies struck to test a design depicting 'Miss Liberty,' surrounded by the words 'Liberty Parent of Science & Industry.' That motto wasn't adopted for circulating coins. Kevin Lipton had the winning bid for the penny, The Los Angeles Times reported. 'It’s like our very first penny,' he told the newspaper. 'It’s such a spectacular coin. It’s so important, so rare.'

The 55-year-old first spotted the penny inside an auction house in 1981, the newspaper reported. However, Lipton told The New York Daily News he didn't pay much notice, saying 'I didn't understand coins like that back then. Now I understand the greatest American coins are the ones that represent where we started.' Lipton paid $2,232,500 in order to get a 1792 quarter from the Orlando auction where he forked over the millions for the penny, The Los Angeles Times reported. That means he spent around $4.8 million total for 26 cents, the newspaper explained. The Los Angeles Times reported that Lipton first collected coins at the age of 12 and started a coin business at the age of 17. 'They are a great store value, and will only be worth more in the future,' Lipton told the newspaper of his new purchases. 'They are literally Mona Lisas of our coinage.' The penny's sale took place a day after another rare penny sold for $2.35 million at the same collectors' convention. A U.S. penny from 1793 sold Wednesday for $2.35 million.

"It has been long assumed that sharks are one of the more primitive forms of fish. But new analysis of a 415 million-year-old fossilised fish has shed doubt on the idea that sharks are the primitive forerunners of modern jawed vertebrates. Modern-day sharks have internal skeletons made of cartilage, and don't have any bony armour on the outside of their faces, unlike other fish living today. A fossilised 415 million-year-old fish called Janusiscus (shown above) provides critical evidence for a well-developed external skeleton (shown in blue) in the shared ancestor of bony fishes and cartilaginous fishes such as sharks. This means that sharks are not as primitive as assumed, experts say . Now researchers from the University of Oxford and Imperial College London have suggested that modern sharks shed their bony skeletons early in their evolutionary history. When examining the fossil, they found it suggested that the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates, was not very shark-like. They used X-rays and CT scans to look inside the skull and found that the structure surrounding the brain was reminiscent of cartilaginous fish (chondrichthyans) such as sharks and rays. The fish fossil’s ‘two faces’ led to it being named Janusiscus after the double-faced Roman god Janus. Modern-day sharks have internal skeletons made of cartilage, but don't have any bony armour on the outside of their faces, like other living fish. A blue shark accommpanied by a pilot fish is pictured . The team of researchers from the University of Oxford used x-ray micro CT scanning to build up a 3D image of the fossil enabling them to 'see' inside the skull and brain case. By comparing the fossil to others from both bony and cartilaginous fish such as sharks, the team saw that it had features from both branches of evolution and additional features which are seen in much more primitive fish. The dual-sided nature of the specimen led them to rename it Janusiscus, after the two-faced Roman god Janus. Although it's rare to find a surviving brain case from this period, Dr Brazeau says the fossil isn’t a 'missing link' in our understanding of vertebrate evolution. ‘It's misleading to think of evolution as a ladder which we reconstruct with “missing links”’ he said. ‘It's more accurate to think of it as a family tree, and research into evolution is like solving a puzzle. Each new piece you find throws the surrounding pieces into context and helps you to understand them better.’ Because of its external features, experts had wrongly thought it belonged to the bony fish family, osteichthyans, a group which includes familiar fish such as cod and tuna as well as all land-dwelling creatures with backbones. Dr Matt Friedman of Oxford University’s Department of Earth Sciences said: ‘This 415 million year-old fossil gives us an intriguing glimpse of the ‘Age of Fishes’, when modern groups of vertebrates were really beginning to take off in an evolutionary sense. ‘It tells us that the ancestral jawed vertebrate probably doesn’t fit into our existing categories.’ The scans revealed Janusiscus lacks a division across the bottom of its brain case, which places it an early stage of evolution - but it also has a bony external skull. It shares features with two distinct evolutionary branches of early fish: those with skeletons of cartilage, like sharks, and the bony fish that went on to become land vertebrates and, ultimately, humans. Chondrichthyans, such as sharks, have often been viewed as primitive, and treated as proxies for what the ‘ancestral’ jawed vertebrate would have looked like, largely due to their lack of bony skeleton, according to the study, published in Nature. Dr Friedman explained: ‘This mix of features, some reminiscent of bony fishes and others cartilaginous fishes, suggests that humans may have just as many features that you might call “primitive” as sharks. ‘Losing your bony skeleton sounds like a pretty extreme adaptation but with remarkable discoveries from China, Janusiscus strongly suggests that that the ancient ancestors of modern sharks and their kin started out just as ‘bony’ as our own ancestors.’ The fossil was previously thought to belong to the bony fish, osteichthyans, a group which includes familiar fish such as cod and tuna (illustrated witha  stock image) as well as all land-dwelling creatures with backbones, but is now known to be an ancestor of the sharks too . The fossil was found in Siberia in 1972 and is currently held in the Institute of Geology at the Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia. Dr Martin Brazeau from Imperial’s Department of Life Sciences spotted its potential in providing new insights into the period of evolution. He said: ‘I knew straight away that this was a fossil that merited further investigation. ‘Although Janusiscus does have a bony skull - which led to it being first classified as a bony fish - it lacked many other features you’d expect in that group. ‘It also lacked a feature seen in both early bony fishes and sharks, which is a division across the brain case. This clearly places it at an early stage of evolution, before the two branches split. ‘It shows that fish from this time, which are ancestors of both sharks and bony fish, had bones too, and sharks must have lost them at a later point. ‘Janusiscus has helped us to look at sharks differently and will ensure they are no longer dismissed as being “frozen” at a primitive stage of evolution.’","Researchers from the University of Oxford and Imperial College London have are-examined a 415 million-year-old fossilised fish found in the 1970s .

The Lingzhi has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years. It is very distinctive looking as it is flat, with a conspicuous red-varnished, kidney-shaped cap and, depending on a caps's age, is white with brown pores underneath. It has no gills on its underside and releases its spores through fine pores. When fresh, it is described as 'soft and corky'. Store owner Wei Fangning showed the giant mushroom (pictured) - also known as ganoderma lucidum - off at his shop in Hezhou city, in China's south-west Guangxi province.

Based on a 'basic' bag of Lingzhi powder priced at $30 (£20) for 0.56lbs (250 grams), however, the giant mushroom is worth around US$894 (£592). The Lingzhi mushroom is sought after in medicine because it is associated with long life. There are said to be around a 1,000 compounds found in the mushroom. It is said to boost immunity thanks to active compounds called polysaccharides, which can increase the activity of white blood cells, according to one herbalist. Experts at the Chinese Academy of Sciences also claimed that the polysaccharides and triterpenes – hydrocarbons - in the lingzhi are the key ingredients to maintaining a physiological balance within the human body. It is used to help lower blood pressure and relieve symptoms of allergies as well as coughs and asthmas. Some herbalists think it can even slow down the ageing process. Scientists have suggested that beta-glucans, which are complex sugars found in Lingzhi, may also stop the growth and spread of cancer cells. The Lingzhi has been recognised for its medicinal properties for over 2,000 years and some modern scientists have documented its powerful effects. The mushroom was documented in ancient scripts and its first known depictions in art, in 1,400 AD, are associated with Taoism. The images extended beyond religion to appear in paintings, furniture and even women's accessories. The first book wholly devoted to medicinal herbs was Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing written in 25 to 220 AD. In it, it describes some health benefits of the Lingzhi. In updated volumes, the mushroom was attributed with therapeutic properties, such as enhancing vital energy, strengthening cardiac function, increasing memory, and even anti-ageing effects. Wild Lingzhi is rare and before it was cultivated, only the nobility could afford it. It was believed that the sacred fungus grew in the home of the immortals on the 'three aisles of the blest' off the coast of China.

"The working class are being squeezed out of high-end resort towns as America's rich-poor divide worsens, according to a new report. Indeed, Loly Garcia, 49, told the Associated Press that she was forced to move to a mobile home park 23 miles west of Aspen after getting married because she couldn't property in the luxury ski spot, dominated by millionaires. As a result of the grueling commute, she gave up her hotel job and took on lower-paying work closer to home. Many low income workers are said to be facing similar situations. 'It's hard to live here,' Garcia said of residing in Aspen, where the average property sale is now $5 million. Rich-poor divide: Loly Garcia, 49,  was forced to move to a mobile home park 23 miles west of Aspen because she couldn't afford property in the luxury ski spot dominated by billionaires . The city dramatically demonstrates an unnerving trend: Across the country, the rich are getting richer while the rest of the country is essentially treading water. From 2009 to 2012, inflation-adjusted income for the wealthiest one per cent of U.S. households surged 31per cent, according to economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley. For everyone else, income inched up just 0.4per cent. In Aspen, the division is especially stark because it goes beyond mere money. The wealth gap is also a geographic divide. The people who clean the vacation homes, maintain the mansions' gardens and work in the hotels must find housing in mobile home parks or subdivisions squeezed into the few acres of developable space dozens of miles to the west. A lucky few - about half of Aspen's year-round population of 6,700 - are able to score units in the town's unusual affordable housing program that, on the open market, would sell for millions of dollars. Meanwhile, residents who struggle to find affordable real estate watch an increasing number of houses in town become rarely inhabited vacation properties. 'It's a mirror image of Detroit, where wealth, not poverty, is driving population down,' said Mick Ireland, a former three-term Aspen mayor. Aspen's dilemma is similar to that of other resort towns, from Nantucket, Massachusetts, to Park City, Utah, especially those nestled in the jagged terrain of the western United States. In the West, vast tracts of public land and sheer mountain faces prevent the easy development of suburbs to house workers, pushing clusters of more affordable housing many miles away. The jobs in these communities are largely in the lower-paying service industry, yet the resort towns are a destination for the global upper class, said Bill Hettinger, author of Living and Working in Paradise, a book on resort towns. 'In New York City, you can house your resort workers in the Bronx or Queens. But in Aspen, they're in Rifle, (about 70) miles down an icy mountain road,' Hettinger said. 'That's the problem any resort community faces. It has no middle-income base to build on.' Aspen's median family income of $71,000 is higher than the state average. But the further 'down-valley,' or to the west, you drive, the more incomes drop until you hit Glenwood Springs, 51 miles west, where the median family income of $54,000 is below average and carpenters, plumbers and other laborers regularly spend hours commuting to Aspen. The situation would be worse had Aspen not gone to extraordinary lengths to try to avoid being hollowed out by the departure of middle-class and working-class residents. Financed by a 1.5per cent charge on real estate sales and a mandate that any new projects include affordable housing, the city and county run a 40-year-old program that allows people who have worked for one year or longer in Aspen to rent, or buy, cheap residences. Growing concern: Resort towns like Aspen dramatically demonstrate an unnerving trend: Across the country, the rich are getting richer while the rest of the country is essentially treading water . Some of these properties are in prime position, like one-bedroom ski-in, ski-out units at the base of the lifts downtown, added to a new development to comply with the city's regulations. The properties are allocated in an online lottery. Before the Internet age, the whole town was riveted by suspense over who would win a cherished affordable home. Names were drawn out of a hopper, and the event was broadcast live on the local radio station. Doctors and lawyers, as priced out of most homes here as carpenters and bartenders, take advantage of the program. Everyone in town praises the program for maintaining a critical mass of year-round families that give Aspen a more lived-in feel than many of its competitors. 'Most ski towns are 20 and drunk, and 75 and retired,' said Adam Frisch, 47, an Aspen city councilman, father of two and former banker who was able to buy a house outside the affordable housing program - what's referred to as a 'free market' property. The housing program has helped maintain part of Aspen's legend, a place where ski bums and teachers rubbed shoulders with rock stars and millionaires in the 1960s and 1970s - and today with billionaires and hedge fund titans. But many in town grumble about inequality. The mordant joke is that the billionaires are pushing out the millionaires. Cheaper eateries frequented by locals are relentlessly replaced by upscale restaurants and high-end shops, and even the Aspen realtor's association office was pushed out of town because it couldn't afford to pay the skyrocketing rents. Frisch said he doesn't feel the town has changed, just income inequality nationally, which shows up here in a concentrated form. 'In the 1970s, that upper, upper, upper echelon, they were making ten times more than the $40,000-a-year teacher,' Frisch said. 'That same group that shows up here, they are 100 times wealthier than the painter, than the teacher, than the ski bum, than they were in the '80s. The homes are bigger, the jets are bigger.' Ireland, however, warned that Aspen's feel is different than a decade or two ago, when year-round residents lived in all parts of town. 'When I moved to town, you could rent a room one of those houses on the west end, and the owner would come out for the music festival in the summer,' said Ireland, who arrived in 1979. 'Now the guy doesn't need your $400-a-month and doesn't want you trampling on the carpet.' Some here say living amid rampant inequality is just the price one pays for residing in what locals sometimes call 'Disneyland for adults.' Elizabeth Milias, a former official in President George W. Bush's administration who writes a blog critical of Aspen's political establishment, said she has grown tired of complaints. 'There's that sense that, my God, their lives would have been so much better if they lived in Cleveland,' she said. 'Aspen can't exist without high-end tourists. They signed up for that.' That's why Jose Herrera moved to these mountains from Mexico. The 25-year-old construction worker can't afford the prices in town and lives dozens of miles away in a mobile home park. But he doesn't resent the wealthy. 'The company where I work builds houses for rich people, and because of that it pays well,' Herrera said. 'One way or another, we help each other out.'","From 2009 to 2012, inflation-adjusted income for the wealthiest one per cent of U.S. households surged 31per cent, according to economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley .

"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said immigration 'complicates things' in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris. Mr Sarkozy, 59, was speaking after he joined leaders from across the world - and linked arms with political rival Francois Hollande - during yesterday's march in Paris in a defiant show of unity. Seventeen people were killed in a terrorist attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, police officers and a kosher supermarket.

Protesters waved pencils and flags at Place de la Nation at the rally in Paris in a show of defiance . Mr Sarkozy has said immigration 'complicates things' in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris . Mr Sarkozy, who was the first French president not to be re-elected for a second time since 1981, said:  'The question of immigration will be the subject of an extremely deep debate because we cannot continue like this. 'Immigration, which we have such problems coping with, creates the problem of integration, which creates communitarianism, where people identify with their own community. 'And people like those who carried out the attacks which killed 17 people last week can conceal themselves within this communitarianism.' Mr Sarkozy, the son of a Hungarian immigrant and a French mother of Greek-Jewish origin, has long taken a hard stance against immigration. As interior minister he notoriously talked of hosing down troubled housing estates, describing young delinquents in the Paris suburbs as racaille, or rabble. Later as president he pushed through measures to curb illegal immigration - including the highly controversial mass deportation of Roma Gypsies. Mr Sarkozy joined world leaders for the march in Paris - there were almost two million people in the capital . Mr Sarkozy said: 'The question of immigration will be the subject of an extremely deep debate because we cannot continue like this' His comments came as the French government admitted 'we are at war' and prepared to hold an anti-terrorism crisis meeting today. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said there would be a clampdown on 'home grown' killers. 'We are involved in a war against terrorism, against radical Islam, against Jihadism,' Mr Valls said, as he pledged new measures to fight the growing menace. Mr Valls admitted to 'clear failings in the system' which saw surveillance on three Paris-born killers dropped six months ago because they were considered 'low priority'. Mr Sarkozy, stood to the left of current President Mr Hollande, has long taken a tough stance on immigration . The violence in Paris began on Wednesday when Cherif and Said Kouachi, both heavily armed, attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine. The brothers then went on the run, before becoming surrounded by police at a warehouse in Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) north of Paris, on Friday. They were eventually killed after exchanging fire with police. On the same day, another gunman Amedy Coulibaly, took several hostages at a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris on Friday. Four hostages died - Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen, and Francois-Michel Saada. Coulibaly is also believed to be behind the killing of a policewoman in southern Paris on Thursday. His widow Hayat Boumeddiene - who flled to Syria from Turkey today - is now the most wanted person in France. It is believed Boumeddiene evaded capture in Istanbul because French intelligence services did not share details of her identity with their Turkish counterparts. A source told MailOnline: 'She just slipped through the net. It is that simple. It should not have happened. 'She should have been on the radar of French intelligence, and they should have told their contacts about her movements – but they failed to do that. 'If the security services had done their job properly, they would never have let her leave the country. 'But once she left France and arrived in Turkey, she had the opportunity to go anywhere. It is unbelievable she has got away so easily.' An estimated 3.7million people marched across France yesterday, the majority gathering in Paris (above) It was also revealed that the Kouachi brothers were on UK and US terror watch lists and Coulibaly was convicted for plotting to free a known militant from prison. He met Cherif Kouachi while in jail, and the three soon formed into a terrorist cell which was able to get hold of automatic rifles and other weapons with relative ease. Despite their criminal convictions and clear links to IS and other terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, they were given free rein to strike. Michel Thooris, a Police trade union leader, said: 'Somewhere along the line the suspects fell through the cracks. 'Either the judicial system did not sentence them strongly enough, or there was a failure in police surveillance. This was a military strike against civilians by individuals at war, in a country at peace.' Security services on both sides of the Channel have warned further attacks are 'highly likely' and Prime Minister David Cameron is consulting senior intelligence officials in Downing Street.","Sarkozy says immigration will be the subject of 'extremely deep debate'

"It was an excruciating moment that left some wondering whether Joe Biden was acting a little strange. Having leaned in towards the already awkward-looking teenage daughter of a senator, he tries to kiss her on the head - to which she recoils. But 13-year-old Margaret Coons insists she doesn't think the Vice-President is creepy. The incident was among a number of awkward moments at the swearing-in ceremony of the new Congress last week. Pained: After posing with the family of Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware (left), Biden leaned down to whisper something to Coons's daughter Margaret. She did not seem to enthused by what he had to say . Turned away: Perhaps the most excruciatingly awkward part of the ceremony was when Biden tried to kiss Coons's daughter Margaret on the head and she turned away . Miss Coons's father, Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, said of his daughter: 'No, she doesn't think the vice president is creepy. 'He's known my kids their whole lives. Joe was just being thoughtful.' He told Fox News Sunday that Mr Biden was simply leaning forward to offer her support for what would be a busy day in the public eye. He said: 'I could hear him. 'He was whispering some encouragement to her about how when he was sworn in and his own daughter Ashley was 13 and she felt awkward and uncomfortable and he was encouraging her about how to get through a day with lots of cameras and lots of folks watching. 'He was being Joe. He was being thoughtful and he was being sweet.' Margaret Coons with her father, Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, and family at home . Stale jokes: Biden later used the same line when he met freshman Senator Joni Ernst's (in red) teenage daughter Libby (left) Earlier, Biden's humor had taken a somewhat creepier tone when he was introduced to Utah Senator Orrin Hatch's teenage granddaughter Emily. Biden commented: 'I hope you have a big fence around the house!' The comment was made as Biden posed with the 80-year-old Republican senator's large family, on the day he officially became president pro tempore of Congress. Biden thought the joke about the girl's good looks so funny, he whipped it out again when he met the daughter of freshman Senator Joni Ernst. Pictures from the event show Biden with his arm around the republican's daughter Libby as Senator Ernst places her hand on a Bible to be sworn in. Getting close: Biden was pictured with his arm around Libby as her mother was sworn in. The VP probably didn't make a great impression on Ernst, since he called her by her husband's name - Gail (in red tie) - when they met last week . He probably won't be calling Senator Ernst up for favors anytime soon. In addition to the strange comment towards her daughter, Biden also got the senator's name wrong at first - calling Joni by her husband's name, Gail. Throughout the rest of the day, Biden continued to throw out flattery left and right. 'As they say in southern Delaware, 'Boy, you married up,'' he told the husband of Maine republican Susan Collins. Biden has spent more than three decades in the senate.","Margaret Coons recoiled when Biden leaned in to kiss her at ceremony .

"After receiving a call from a gay man who said he suffered homophobic abuse on a train in Luton, two radio presenters decided to conduct an experiment. BBC Three Counties DJs Iain Lee and Justin Dealey walked through the town to gauge the public reaction to an openly gay couple. A 23-year-old called Nick had told them he was used to being insulted by strangers when he and his boyfriend held hands. Scroll down for video . Radio presenters Iain Lee and Justin Dealey conducted the experiment after a caller said he suffered homophobic abuse on a train . The pair pretend to be a gay couple and walk through the town to gauge the public reaction to a gay couple . And after the two presenters walked the streets of Luton doing so, they were shocked to be told: 'It's disgusting'. In the video, the men walk down a street and as they pass a group of men, each one turns to stare at the supposedly gay couple. Mr Dealey says: 'We've walked about three or four minutes and we've had looks, we've definitely had looks.' And Mr Lee says: 'I saw a dad usher a child away from us, did you see that? 'Yeah, there was a dad walking with his kid, he clocked the hands, clocked us, and then said, 'Come on, love. Come on.' Mr Dealey says: 'We've walked about three or four minutes and we've had looks, we've definitely had looks' As they pass a group of men in hi-vis vests, each one turns to stare at the supposedly gay couple . But then they approach a teenager after overhearing him say 'urgh' after noticing their entwined hands. They approach the boy and ask him to elaborate on his comment and are told: 'I thought it was disgusting.' Asked why, he repeats: 'Because it's disgusting.' A woman, who was with him at the time, says: 'He doesn't obviously agree with homosexuality. He's got a stigma. He's a teenage boy.' And when asked for her own views, she says: 'I'm not against it, but I don't like it in my face to be honest. 'It does make me feel a little bit embarrassed if you two were to embrace in a kiss, I would feel a little bit awkward but that's about as far as it would go.' She adds she is not 'narrow-minded' but says: 'Especially in Luton you don't see that. You wouldn't see that.' And the boy then repeats: 'I just think it's wrong for two men, I think it's disgusting in my opinion.' At the end of the experiment, Mr Lee concludes: 'It certainly felt uncomfortable. Whereas I know if you'd been a girl and I was holding your hand, there would have been nothing. He adds: 'I'm surprised and disappointed.' They approach a teenager : 'I just think it's wrong for two men, I think it's disgusting'","Radio presenters Iain Lee and Justin Dealey decided to conduct experiment after a caller said he suffered homophobic abuse on a train .

"A 19-year-old man charged with killing his newspaper publisher father, his mother and sister has been transferred to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to serve a sentence on another charge. Alan Hruby was moved from the Stephens County jail to the Department of Corrections’ facility in Lexington on Friday to begin a three-year sentence for fraudulently opening a credit card in the name of his grandmother. Hruby pleaded guilty to the charge in January and was placed in a delayed sentencing program. Alleged murderer Alan Hruby, 19, (pictured left) was moved to prison on Friday to serve three years for opening a credit card in his grandmother's name. He is pictured right in his latest prison mugshot . However that was revoked in October after Hruby was charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of his father, John Hruby; his mother, Tinker Hruby; and his sister, Katherine Hruby. John Hruby was publisher of the weekly newspaper The Marlow Review. Earlier this month, a life insurance company had asked an Oklahoma judge to decide whether they should be forced to hand over $20,000 to the teen, who allegedly murdered his entire family in order to cash in on the policy. The self-proclaimed shopaholic, who was drowning in debt, reportedly confessed that he had gunned down his family in October in the hope of paying off a $3,000 loan shark debt. Hruby is facing the death penalty. Last week, American Fidelity Assurance Co. petitioned a judge to disqualify him from receiving the policy proceeds. The company said it can deny Hruby the money because of his alleged role in his family members' death, but needed the judge's approval. The payout would come from two American Fidelity policies held by Hruby's rural newspaper publisher father, NewsOK reported. His father, John Hruby, named his wife Tinker as the main beneficiary. In the event of her death, the money was to go to Alan and his sister Katherine Hruby, 17. Authorities said Alan Hruby admitted he murdered his family to become the sole heir after he was cut off by them financially. The insurance company asked Stephens County Associate District Judge Brent Russell to decide whether or not they must pay out the policy. Without the petition, the company said it will be forced to make good on the payment despite Hruby's confession. Prosecutors in Duncan, Oklahoma, filed three charges of first-degree murder against University of Oklahoma student Hruby. Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks said Hruby owed money to a loan shark. Hicks did not say why Hruby had so much debt, only that his spending was out of control. Alan told police that he murdered his father, John, 50 (center); mother, Tinker, 48 (right); and his 17-year-old sister Katherine (left) in October in order to claim the money from a life-insurance policy . Hruby's social media posts would routinely boast of his expensive lifestyle and he was a self-proclaimed shopaholic . 'The reason we were given for the murders was that he was having financial difficulties,' Hicks said at a news conference in Duncan. 'He felt if he murdered (his family) he would be the only heir to the estate.' Hicks said Hruby shot his mother and father twice each and his sister once. He later left the family's house and disposed of the gun and a disc from a home security system. Hruby then traveled to Dallas for the weekend, where he stayed at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, Hicks said. Hicks said Alan Hruby acted 'very nonchalant' and 'cold and callous' when he arrived at the home where the bodies of his parents were discovered by the family's housekeeper on Monday. 'I tend to think this is a very heinous and atrocious crime,' Hicks said. 'This shows the fact there was no remorse; this shows this was an evil person. 'Any tears that were shed (by Alan) were crocodile tears,' he said . John Hruby was the publisher of The Marlow Review, a weekly newspaper with a circulation of about 3,500. His wife also worked at the paper. Hruby was also publisher of The Duncan Banner until 1997, when his family sold that paper, and was vice president of the Oklahoma Newspaper Foundation Board of Trustees, a part of the Oklahoma Press Association.","Alan Hruby, 19, shot dead his mother, father and sister on October 9, according to investigators, for life-insurance payout .

"Paul Ryan announced Monday he won't be running for president in 2016, while both Mitt Romney and Chris Christie continued to inch closer to throwing their hats into the ring. Ryan, a nine-term Wisconsin congressman and the Republican Party's last vice presidential nominee on Romney's ticket, thanked those who encouraged him to seek the presidency, but said he wanted to focus all of his attention on his new role as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 'After giving it a lot of thought, I’ve decided not to run for president,' Ryan said in a press release. 'Our work at the House Ways and Means Committee over the next few years will be crucial to moving America forward, and my job as Chairman deserves undivided attention. He's out: Paul Ryan, the Republican Party's last vice presidential nominee, announced he won't be running for president in 2016 . The Wisconsin congressman stated he wanted to focus all of his attention on his new role as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . 'It’s clear our country needs a change in direction. And our party has a responsibility to offer a real alternative. So I’m going to do what I can to lay out conservative solutions and to help our nominee lead us to victory.'. Ryan was among those Romney, his running mate in 2012, personally telephoned over the weekend to gauge their support for a third campaign. Romney's possible 2016 campaign was barely on the horizon at this time last week and would be the first return engagement of a losing major party nominee in decades. 'It is no secret that I have always thought Mitt would make a great president,' he told NBC News. 'As for his plans for 2016, I don't know what he is ultimately going to do and the last thing I want to do is get ahead of his own decision making process.' Asked by AP Monday if he would back another Romney bid for the White House, Ryan, 44, demurred, saying, 'It's premature for any of that.' The former Massachusetts governor shocked former staff, supporters and donors on Friday when he told a private gathering in New York that he is again seriously exploring a campaign, a change for Romney after several months of insisting his career in politics had comes to its end. The next day, he and his wife, Ann, began reaching out to others as members of their inner circle started to revive a political operation that had begun to move on. 'We had a great conversation. He made it clear to me he is seriously considering the race,' said Jim Merrill, a top Romney staffer in New Hampshire during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns. 'When you get a phone call like that at close to 9 on a Saturday night, it means something.' Calls from Romney also went to several boldface names in Republican politics, including Ryan; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich; New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and the state's former governor, John Sununu; former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who ran for president in 2012; Meg Whitman, chief executive at Hewlett-Packard Co.; Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz; two former senators, Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Jim Talent of Missouri; and David Kochel, Romney's senior Iowa strategist in both of his previous campaigns. Third time's the charm? Mitt Romney is reaching out to former staff and supporters as he considers a third run for president. Romney and his wife, Ann, phoned former backers in the early voting states over the weekend . Ally: Asked if he would back another Romney bid for the White House, his former running mate Ryan said it was too early to tell . Said former New Hampshire volunteer Chris Wolfe, who backed Romney's first two bids, 'All we're really waiting for is somebody to pull the trigger and say, ""We're in.""' Former aides suggested Monday that Romney could easily become a force in the coming contest, pointing to the more than $1billion he raised and 60 million votes he garnered in the last election. Yet he would face far greater challenges in the next presidential contest than he did in the last, particularly in the early primaries against a crowded field expected to feature more than a dozen Republicans with legitimate White House resumes, including several sitting governors and US senators. None threatens Romney's prospects more than former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, an early establishment favorite who has already begun to draw from the same pool of Republican donors who fueled Romney's last campaign. Bush has yet to formally launch a campaign, but has been among the most aggressive would-be candidates in recent weeks, having launched a fundraising operation and attended a series of private meetings with donors across the country. Romney could also face another establishment favorite, New Jersey Governor Christie, who is sending new signals that an announcement about his presidential plans could be imminent. The Republican National Committee's top fundraiser, Texas-based Ray Washburne, is preparing to join Christie's team. He told the AP Monday, 'I won't be the national finance chairman at the end of the week.' Crowded field: Romney could face former Florida Governor Jeb Bush (left) and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (right), who is sending new signals that an announcement about his plans could be imminent . He declined to comment further because Christie has yet to announce his 2016 intentions. Washburne was a leading fundraiser for Bush's brother, former President George W. Bush. Christie's team is expected to start making moves to raise money for a prospective presidential campaign by the end of the month, according to a person who has been in touch with Christie's team, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the plans publicly. That could include the potential formation of a political action committee to begin raising cash that can be used to support a prospective campaign, the person said. Christie's chief political adviser, Mike DuHaime, declined to comment. Meanwhile, a handful of other prospective presidential contenders were preparing Monday to appear later this week at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in San Diego. The agenda includes former neurosurgeon and conservative favorite Ben Carson, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and outgoing Texas Governor Rick Perry. The summit will take place close to Romney's southern California home. A spokesman did not immediately respond when asked if Romney or his representatives would attend the meeting. In New Hampshire on Monday, former three-term New York Governor George Pataki capped a two-day trip to the early voting state sounding very much like a politician ready to jump into the race. He told the AP in an interview he's again considering a White House campaign because the nation can't risk electing another Democratic president. 'That's one of the reasons I think the outcome of this election is so important, and I'm so much more inclined to get involved,' Pataki said.","Ryan stated he wanted to focus all of his attention on his new role as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .

"Early learning programs may help children stave off obesity along with helping them do better in school, a new study suggests. Researchers from the University of Michigan looked at the BMIs of 19,023 children enrolled in Head Start - a federally-funded pre-school education service for low-income families. After a year, almost three-quarters of the 16per cent who were initially obese had a become a normal weight. Similar patterns were seen for overweight infants on the course. Early learning: Head Start programs have been shown to help poor children do better in school, but they may also help them fight obesity, a study suggests . This trend did not apply to children from Medicaid families and only slightly so with those from wealthier, privately insured families. Lead author Julie Lumeng says there a several factors of Head Start that could have a positive impact on a child's BMI. The quality of federally-regulated food provided may be higher than that in other child care facilities and pupils could have more opportunity for physical activity. Researchers say the potential benefits are important because obesity is so hard to treat and disproportionately affects low-income children. Dr. David Ludwig, a Harvard Medical School pediatrics professor and director of an obesity prevention center at Children's Hospital Boston, called the results 'encouraging'. Head Start is a federal pre-kindergarten program offered free in every state to low-income families. It often involves full-day preschool, focusing on school readiness, healthy eating and physical activity. Many programs provide children two daily meals, and give families health and nutrition advice. More than 1 million U.S. children participate. Nationwide, about eight per cent of preschoolers are obese, but the rate was mostly higher during the 2005-13 study. The recent piece of research was published online Monday in Pediatrics.","Researchers from the University of Michigan looked at the BMIs of 19,023 children enrolled in Head Start .

"A student was jailed for three years for declaring himself an atheist on Facebook in Egypt . An Egyptian court has sentenced a student to three years in jail for 'contempt of Islam' after he admitted being an atheist on Facebook. Karim al-Banna, a 22-year-old engineering undergraduate, was arrested in November in the Nile delta city of Idku and jailed on Saturday. It follows a crackdown by the military government on 'immoral behaviour'. Mr Banna's neighbours read the Facebook post and invited him to talk about it at a café, where they secretly called the police, according to Fatma Serag, a lawyer with the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression which is representing the student. Another lawyer Abdel Nabi said his client's father testified against his son during the trial as he 'was embracing extremist ideas against Islam'. Atheism is not illegal but Mr Banna was found guilty of insulting the Muslim faith under the Egyptian penal code which criminalises defamation of the three recognised religions of Islam, Christianity and Judaism. His sentence could be suspended until a verdict is issued by the appeals court if he pays bail of £93. The case follows a steady rise in 'contempt of religion' cases since the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood . Massive protests across Egypt against President Morsi's rule led to his ousting in July 2013 . There has been an increase in 'contempt of religion' cases since the Muslim Brotherhood and President Mohamed Morsi were overthrown. In December 2012, 27-year-old blogger Alber Saber was sentenced to three years in jail on charges of blasphemy. And last June, a Coptic Christian man was sentenced to six years in jail for insulting Islam. Fatma Naoot, a writer, is standing trial after allegedly criticising the traditional slaughter of sheep during the Muslim holiday of Eid, while the poet Karim Saber was jailed last year for his short story collection entitled Where is God. The military-backed authorities have stepped up measures to prove they are more Islamic than the previous regime they brought down during the Arab Spring.","Karim al-Banna, 22, was arrested in November for 'contempt of Islam'

"Antique jewelry made out of real human hair is once again being worn by collectors who are intrigued by the deeply personal keepsakes, which were originally created as a sign of affection or mourning. Wearing an accessory crafted out of a loved one's hair may sound creepy, but wearing jewelry containing the lopped-off locks was a common practice in the United States and Europe throughout the late-Georgian and Victorian eras - and now, it seems, the trend is back in fashion. 'I think part of the reason people are fascinated by it is that it does repulse on a certain level,' jewelry collector Evan Michelson told Racked. Hairy situation: Jewelry made out of human hair was widely popular throughout the late-Georgian and Victorian eras . Morbid memento: Mourning jewelry, created out of a deceased person's hair, was worn to remember the dead . 'It's powerfully charged because hair really affects people on this visceral level.' Ms. Michelson, who co-owns antiques store Obscura Antiques, added that buyers are often drawn to the slightly morbid pieces because of the strange emotions that they evoke. Mourning jewelry fashioned out of the hair of the deceased was worn as a part of the grieving process. Victorian hairwork was also seen as a token of affection for a lover, a family member or a dear friend, similar to a locket or a friendship bracelet. Collector, jeweler and scholar Karen Bachmann agrees. 'When I wear hair jewelry, people that know the genre will appreciate it and admire it,' she said to the outlet. 'But people that don't know it will look and wonder what it is. That also, in a perverse sort of way, is what interests me.' Cant' get enough: Evan Michelson (left) and Karen Bachmann (right) are avid collectors of Victorian hairwork . The sentimental pieces were created out of elaborately woven hair typically set in glass and adorned with gold or gemstones. Throughout the 19th century, human hair was used to create everything from braided bracelets to brooches. Ms. Michelson compared the 'obsessive' attention to detail to 'prison work'. 'Victorian hairwork is just so well done,' Ms. Michelson explained. 'It takes years of dedication and practice - it was a real craft. 'The labor involved makes you appreciate the difficult aspect of working with it. I can imagine how working with hair would be an act of devotion, turning these precious relics of someone you love into something more precious.' Strange love: Wearing hair from a lover, family member or friend was seen as a token of affection in the Victorian era . The collection of hair jewelry has gained popularity, although Ms. Michelson noted that a one time, 'you couldn't give hairwork away.' She recalled that when she first started looking for the unique pieces, she learned that many dealers were disposing of the hair and only selling the expensive antique frames. Ms. Bachmann said she was interested in the 'esoteric and odd' when she was an undergraduate student at Pratt and fell in love with Victorian hairwork during that time. Both women are avid collectors of hair jewelry. 'I just can't get enough of it,' Ms. Michelson said. 'It's so beautiful.' Ms. Bachmann noted: 'The more I collect it and the more I see the forms that can be made, the more interested I am.' Hair club: The Victorian Hairwork Society is an internet based organization that brings together those interested in the art of hair jewelry . Both women are personally involved with the Morbid Anatomy Museum in Brooklyn, which opened in June 2014. Ms. Bachmann is an artist and scholar-in-residence at the museum, while Ms. Michelson is on the board of trustees. Pieces from their personal collections are a currently on display as apart of 'The Art of Mourning' exhibit, which showcases decorative arts relating to mourning culture from the 18th to the 20th century. 'It's given me a place to speak about my passion for hair jewelry,' Ms. Bachmann said of the institute. For those who are fascinated by hair jewelry but live outside New York City, the Victorian Hairwork Society is an internet based organization that brings together those interested in the history, preservation, restoration and continuation of the art.","Mourning jewelry made out of the hair of a deceased friend or family member was worn to remember a loved one .

"Baroness Williams has said the downfall of her marriage, prompted by her husband's affair, was that he was 'vulnerable' to 'hopeful women' Her first husband cheated on her then deserted her. But far from feeling bitter, as many women would, Shirley Williams insists she was partly at fault. The veteran politician also blames the split on women who ‘pinioned’ Bernard Williams, saying the philosophy professor succumbed to their charms because he was too ‘vulnerable’ to resist. Baroness Williams says her burgeoning career – she was a Labour shadow minister at the time – played a part in the collapse of the marriage and urges other women whose husbands leave them to look at themselves with a critical eye. She rejected 12 proposals before marrying Sir Bernard, once described as the most brilliant and most important British moral philosopher of his time, in 1955. They had a daughter in 1961 but ten years later he left her for Patricia Skinner, the young wife of a fellow academic. She is said to have offered to sacrifice her career as a rising political star if he stayed but to no avail and their divorce was finalised in 1974. ‘He [Bernard] was a wonderful man, a brilliant man but he was always a bit… vulnerable, put it that way,’ said Baroness Williams, now 84, yesterday. ‘And of course because he was rather good-looking as well as frighteningly clever, he was pinioned by quite a number of – I have to say – hopeful ladies.’ The Roman Catholic added: ‘I’d been brought up with the view that if you were going to get married, then you had to be faithful – and you only got divorced in the most extreme circumstances.’ Her mother, the feminist author Vera Brittain, initially applauded her decision to marry Williams, telling her: ‘Of all the men you might have married, Bernard obviously has far and away the best mind, and he is also the only one who is capable of putting you before himself.’ Baroness Williams was happy in her second marriage to Harvard historian Richard Neustadt, who died in 2003 – the same year as Sir Bernard. But reflecting on what went wrong the first time, more than 40 years ago, she told the Radio Times she had stopped herself being consumed by anger by asking herself: ‘If your spouse indicates that they feel the time has come to break up, what did I contribute to that?’ She said: ‘You’ve got to understand how it is that he – who you loved – decided to leave you. And if you don’t begin to understand what you have contributed to it, your life will be destroyed by a sense of vengeance, anger, fury, injustice – and, you know, that’s not the way to go. Sir Bernard Williams left his politician wife for Patricia Skinner (pictured above, left following his divorce from Baroness Williams) ‘You’ve got to come to terms with that single question – what did I contribute to this? And only when you have the answer to that can you actually then seriously think about why you broke up. ‘You mustn’t kid yourself that you’re the one who’s been badly treated – you just have to understand how it happened.’ Many regarded Baroness Williams as the woman likely to become Britain's first female prime minister . A former journalist before entering Parliament in 1964, Baroness Williams rose via the Shadow Cabinet in the early 1970s to become Secretary of State for Education and Paymaster General – holding both positions at the same time – as the only woman in James Callaghan’s 1976 Cabinet. Many at the time regarded her, not Margaret Thatcher, as the politician most likely to become Britain’s first woman prime minister. After losing her seat in 1979, Baroness Williams left the Labour Party in 1981 as one of the ‘Gang of Four’ who founded the Social Democratic Party, before becoming a Liberal Democrat peer in 1993. Asked if she encountered sexism in Parliament, or was patronised, she replied: ‘It was more subtle than that. 'It was much more being treated as though you weren’t worth listening to. ‘That was one of the real problems but, to be fair, people like, not just Margaret Thatcher, the usual example but Barbara Castle even earlier, were quite substantial figures and they stood up for what they believed in and argued the case. 'They did not fit into the agreeable, supportive woman concept. It’s about being taken seriously and not being treated as an ancillary figure.’ Meanwhile, a film version of Baroness Williams’ mother’s 1933 book, Testament of Youth, opens this week. Miss Brittain, a pacifist and feminist, was inspired to write it by the deaths of her fiancé, brother and two closest male friends during the First World War. It was adapted for TV in 1979.","Baroness Williams described former husband as 'brilliant' and 'wonderful'

Scroll down for video . Cagle said his client was entitled to use the level of force he did, and should be reinstated as a police officer. He told the Victoria Advocate that Robinson, who plans to appeal the dismissal, acted constitutionally within the law. Robinson stopped Pete Vasquez for an expired vehicle inspection sticker, and video captured him grabbing Vasquez's arm and pushing him onto the police cruiser. The footage didn't show what happened between the two after falling on the ground. Cagle said Vasquez kicked the officer, and that the level of resistance was a basis for using the stun gun and arresting Vasquez. 'There's nothing unreasonable at all about that level of force,' said Cagle, adding that Vasquez 'wasn't injured. He scratched his elbow and hurt his feelings, but those aren't injuries in the constitutional sense.' Victoria Police Chief Jeff Craig has said Robinson violated policies that included conduct and the use of force. He also personally apologized to Vasquez. A criminal investigation into the traffic stop was completed by the Texas Rangers, who turned their findings over to local prosecutors for review. Cagle is an attorney for the Texas Municipal Police Association. Kevin Lawrence, the group's executive director, said it has become more common for administrators and politicians to not stand behind police officers. 'Why we're not giving them more benefit of the doubt today, I don't know,' Lawrence said. 'I think it's a very dangerous path we're on.' Robinson had been with Victoria police for 18 months. 'If you think he could have done it different or better, then that's a training issue,' Cagle said. 'I think he deserves his job back, and that's what we're going to try to do.'","Nathaniel Robinson, 23, was caught by dash-cam tussling with senior .

"An artist was forced to have 25 stitches in each of her eyes after they both burst - with one splitting during a driving lesson. Liz Hodgkinson, from Mold in Wales, was driving along a dual carriageway with her driving instructor when she began to suffer pain and having problems with her sight. After being took back home, Miss Hodgkinson was then rushed to hospital where consultants discovered that her cornea had split and diagnosed her with Keratoconus, a degenerative eye disorder. Liz Hodgkinson, who was diagnosed with Keratoconus, a degenerative eye condition, after one of her eyeballs burst during a driving lesson . The 30-year-old explained: 'It was painful, but I just thought I had something in my eye. 'We were on the A55 dual carriageway at the time, so the instructor told me to get off at the next slip road. He took over the pedals and I kept steering as well as I could. 'The hospital patched me up and told me how to keep it clean.' Miss Hodgkinson then had surgery on her left eye and was still recovering from the first operation when her right eye then burst five months later. After having surgery on her left eye, five months later her right eyeball also split, meaning she had to have 25 stitches in each eye . She recalled: 'The second time I was watching a film. 'The consultants were stunned - it was the most severe case they had ever seen.' She has since had cornea transplants in both eyes and was given 25 stitches in each eyeball during operations that each lasted for three and a half hours at Abergele Eye Hospital. The artist added: 'Fortunately I was under general anaesthetic, otherwise I think I would have had a panic attack. 'It was quite an embroidery project for them.' Most of the stitches have been removed but she now has four stitches in each eye, which may be left in place permanently. Her condition is genetic and her mother and brother are both affected and they believe her great-grandfather, who used to wear an eye patch, also suffered from it. Experts believe the degenerative disorder, which causes the front of the eyeball to thin and bend out of shape, affects between one in 500 and one in 2,000 people, but difficulties with diagnosis make it hard to give an accurate estimate. The condition can cause distorted vision, including multiple images and streaking, as well as sensitivity to light, and is usually diagnosed in teenagers. Miss Hodgkinson explained: 'I knew it could run in the family, so I was always aware of it, but I never realised my eye could actually burst. Most of the stitches have now been removed and the 30-year-old now has four stitches in each eye, which may be left in place permanently. She is pictured after having surgery on her left eye . Miss Hodgkinson has now had to re-learn her art techniques and adapt her style of painting after her vision was affected by her condition . 'My mum Sue suffered with the condition for 25 years, whereas for me, it happened out of the blue.' As a professional artist, the 30-year-old depends on her eyesight to earn a living and has had to adapt her style of work. She mostly works in oils and paints in the traditional Venetian style, which involves huge attention to detail. 'I am not able to see as well as I could and to some extent, I have had to re-learn my techniques and adapt my style', she explained . 'I would not trust myself with portraits anymore because of the finer features of the faces.' She now focuses on landscapes and has recently opened the Moss Piglet Art Gallery, in Ruthin, north Wales, with her friend Rachel Ilsley, who specialises in jewellery. Keratoconus is a condition which causes the cornea in the eye to progressively thin, meaning a cone-shaped bulge develops. It is a genetic disorder and is more common in people with asthma and Down's Syndrome. The thinning and the change in shape of the cornea means the eye is often unable to focus and can therefore impair a person's vision. If it is diagnosed early, treatment can include wearing glasses or contact lenses to correct vision. In more severe cases, a cornea transplant may be needed.

"A Harlem man who spent more than 21 years in jail for murders he did not commit has died, less than a year after being released. Sharrif Wilson, 38, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital. His lawyer Adam Perlmutter said his client had been at the hospital since the end of December suffering from breathing problems. Mr Perlmutter said Wilson suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome, something made significantly worse by his years in prison. Sharrif Wilson, who spent more than 21 years in jail for murders he did not commit, died on Saturday less than a year after he was released . He told the New York Daily News: 'He was a young healthy man when he went in and he was a sick unhealthy man when he came out.' Mr Perlmutter said Wilson's family had begun the process filing civil lawsuits against both the city and the state for his incarceration. Wilson was jailed along with Antonio Yarbough, 40, for the 1992 murders of Yarbough's mother, 12-year-old sister and another relative, also aged 12 The trio had all been choked with electrical cords and stabbed. Wilson initially confessed to the crime and testified against Yarbough in exchange for a lighter sentence. However, he later changed his plea and claimed police had coerced his confession. Wilson and Yarbough were released in February last year. The charges against them were dropped after new evidence surfaced. Members of Wilson's family said they were heartbroken to have lost him. Wilson's co-accused, Antonio Yarbough, left, released a statement saying Wilson's death was 'heartbreaking' His sister Tiffany Wilson, 28, told the paper: 'It felt like my heart was without my chest.' She said Wilson had worked hard to reintegrate after being release and had become obsessed with modern technology like cellphones and social media. Yarbough has reportedly said of Wilson: 'I find it heartbreaking that a boy could serve (21) years for a crime he didn't commit and finally come home and have only 11 months to spend with his family.' In the statement released by his lawyer, Yarbough added: 'My heart breaks for the family and the mother that lost her son not once but twice.'","Sharrif Wilson was jailed along with another man for three murders .

"Anthony McHale set up six fake accounts to claim £32,000 in benefits from Wolverhampton Council . A council benefits assessor created several fake identities to fraudulently claim £32,000 in housing benefits he was not entitled to. Anthony McHale, 55, was branded a 'dishonest, fraudulent crook' by a judge after it was revealed he used his intimate knowledge of the benefits system, learned in his role at Wolverhampton City Council, to set up six fake accounts and funnel the money into his bank. McHale abused his position - one he had held for 24 years - to pocket a total of £32,326.60 in housing benefits between August 1, 2012 and September 8 last year. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison, suspended for two years. At a hearing at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Mary Stacey said: 'You are a dishonest, fraudulent crook who used your specialist knowledge to commit this crime.' The court heard McHale fraudulently claimed the cash while working as a benefit assessor at Wolverhampton City Council, where he was responsible for processing and managing claims. He set up six fraudulent benefit claims under fake female identities with false national insurance numbers, managing the accounts so he could claim the cash himself. McHale used real addresses for the accounts and his scam was only uncovered when a member of public called the council telling them they had received a letter addressed to a claimant who did not live there. The council's fraud department started an investigation into the discrepancy and McHale confessed what he had been doing, saying he needed the cash to pay off his debts. McHale, of Willenhall admitted six counts of fraud. He must also carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. He lives in a two bedroom house in an area of Willenhall where homes are valued at £150,000. Oliver Woolhouse, defending, said McHale had built up massive debts by 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' with five or six credit cards but had kept this secret from his wife. David Elliott, Acting Head of the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service' Crown Court Unit, said after the hearing: 'Anthony McHale was employed by Wolverhampton City Council in a position of trust which involved him dealing with and ensuring the correct benefits were paid to those who were entitled to it. 'However, he abused this trust and through his knowledge of the system, he began to defraud the council by creating fictitious claims and paying housing benefit to himself. McHale used his intimate knowledge of working at Wolverhampton City Council to carry out the fraud . 'Over a two year period McHale defrauded the council out of £32,326.20 which he used to pay off personal debts which he had built up. 'The CPS will now take steps to recover from him the amounts stolen.' Councillor Paul Sweet, Wolverhampton City Council's cabinet member for governance and performance, said: 'The employee was suspended as soon as the allegation came to light and a disciplinary investigation is underway. 'Wolverhampton City Council expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from all of its employees. 'We will not allow people to commit fraud against the council and we will work tirelessly to bring perpetrators to book. 'The city council operates a zero tolerance policy on fraud, corruption and bribery and takes all allegations extremely seriously.'","Anthony McHale was a benefits assessor at Wolverhampton city council .

"An 87-year-old Maryland man has been killed by his pit bull at home as he took down the family Christmas tree, according to police in Frederick County. Police and animal control were called to the home of Eugene Smith on Wednesday last week and found the 84-pound rescue dog still mauling him. They managed to pull the dog off from the attack but it was too late for Smith, who was taken to hospital where he he later succumbed to his injuries. The dog was taken to an animal shelter where it was later destroyed. Scroll Down for Video . Animal lover: Eugene Smith is pictured here with his milk delivery truck. The 87-year-old was popular in the neighborhood and known for taking in stray animals . The Frederick County Sheriff's Office said that Smith was lying on the ground taking the tree down when the dog attacked him. Deputies said that the dog was a stray who Smith had taken in to his rural home, where he lived with his son and his son's fianceé. Smith, who still worked as a milk delivery truck driver, was said to love his canine companion and his friends told WJLA that it would sometimes sleep in the same bed as him. Sgt. David Luckenbaugh with Frederick County Animal Control said that they had no complaints from neighbors about the dog. 'We had no call history to that address, no complaints involving that dog and the dog didn't come in through our shelter,' said Luckenbaugh to the Frederick News Post. 'Our initial indications are that the attack was unprovoked, the victim didn't do any specific thing to cause that to happen.' Attack: Eugene Smith was fatally mauled on Wednesday while he attempted to take down the family Christmas tree . Frederick County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Deputy First Class Amanda Hatcher describes the dog attack that killed  87-year-old Eugene Smith . His colleagues said that Smith, or Smitty had worked for more than 60 years and that the animal lover would keep a stash of biscuits for all the cats and dogs that lived along his route from Maryland to Wisconsin. Medical examiners said that Smith suffered severe injuries to his head and upper body. Luckenbaugh told the Frederick News Post that his officers were working to discover where Smith took the dog in from and who previously owned it, but said that there would be no charges. According to Opposing Views, pit bulls are more than six times as likely to attack their owner as any other breed. This is known as Pit Disloyalty Phenomenon (PDP) and has been known about by the canine lobby for 25 years. However, the pro-pit bull lobby has said that this is nonsense and the breed suffers from poor PR.","Eugene Smith was fatally attacked by his rescued dog on Wednesday .

"Council bosses have been accused of 'vandalising' one of the most beautiful medieval villages in Britain by ripping up its cobbled streets and replacing them with mass-produced paving stones. The historic paths are considered iconic in the village of Dunster in Somerset, which is featured in the Domesday Book and may date back to the Iron Age. But residents are furious after the cobbles - said to be a danger to pedestrians - were removed in favour of a dull grey pavement, which some say looks like 'a new housing estate'. Transformation: The cobbled streets of Dunster, left, have been replaced with bland paving stones, right . Fury: Local residents say the renovations are out of character with their historic surroundings . Although the centre of the roads have long been paved with tarmac to allow cars to drive on them, their edges were until recently made from historic cobblestones. Following complaints about pedestrians slipping on the uneven surfaces, the councils responsible for the village decided to replace them with a smoother pavement. But even those locals who supported the removal of the cobbles say that the new surface is completely inappropriate for its picturesque context. Arthur Ell, who has lived in the village his whole life, said: 'They look like concrete, nothing like the red sandstone that the whole village is built from, and they're machine cut with no history.' The 70-year-old added: 'The understanding was that it would be like what was done in the High Street, which has weathered down and looks fine. 'These are very different stones and everyone in the street is up in arms, we are really upset, it looks like a path on a new housing estate.' Works: The cobbles are being ripped out after pedestrians complained that they were dangerous . Controversy: In 2011, another set of cobbles, left, were replaced by new paving stones, right - but locals say the new project is even worse . Shop owner Jeni Fender called the move 'an act of deliberate vandalism,' adding: 'Dunster is a national treasure and this is a national disgrace.' The village attracts hundreds of visitors every year because it is so well preserved, as well as being home to a 400-year-old castle. In 2011, the local council sparked a national outcry when it replaced the cobbles flanking Dunster's High Street with paving stones imported from China. However, residents say that the new project - centred around the older West Street - is even worse than the previous controversy, as the stones are more homogenous than those used four years ago. Shop owner Jeni Fender said: 'Dunster is probably England's largest and most intact medieval village,' she said. 'It is a national treasure and as such we are unique. 'We don't want the more expensive, perfectly cut stone which just doesn't fit with our charming and quirky village.' Picturesque: The village, shown here in the 1990s, is considered one of the best-preserved in Britain . Christine Oliver, chairman of the parish council, said that the issue would be debated at a forthcoming meeting. Because of the village's historic status, English Heritage has to be consulted over many major planning decisions  - prompting many villagers to blame the conservation body for the botched renovations. But a spokesman for the organisation insisted that it was only consulted on matters required planning permission, and had therefore not been asked to weigh in on the project. Jenny Chesher of English Heritage said: 'We have only just become aware of the replacement of cobbles to pavements in West Street, Dunster and had not received any request for our advice on the works from the local authority. 'We have therefore expressed no opinion on either the principle of the works or the detail of how they would be undertaken, including the selection of stone.' The scheme was apparently proposed by the Dunster Working Group, which includes West Somerset Council, Somerset County Council, Exmoor National Park Authority and the local parish council. A spokesman for the county council said: 'We are fully aware of the historical importance of Dunster and the decision to replace some of the cobbles is in response to local concerns over safety and accessibility. 'The materials being used are locally sourced and fully approved by conservation officers, and the appearance of the stone will change as it weathers.' Dunster is located near the site of two Iron Age hill forts, Bat's Castle and Black Ball Camp - their exact age is unknown, but they could be as much as 3,000 years old. The village itself was first recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book, the first ever thorough land survey of England, and was originally known as 'Torre', meaning 'hill'. It is thought to have gained its full name thanks to a link with a local Anglo-Saxon landowner named Dunn, but after the Norman Conquest it passed into the hands of powerful noble William de Moyon. The Norman landlord built the original Dunster Castle on an outcrop overlooking the village, but it was largely rebuilt in the 17th century as a Jacobean-style manor house, and thoroughly renovated in the Victorian period. Dunster was for centuries a major centre for the wool trade, making its own variety of the material which is particularly thick. The importance of the trade in village life is shown by the Yarn Market, above right, a distinctive 400-year-old building standing in the centre of Dunster.","Historic village of Dunster has kept its cobbled-lined streets for centuries .

"Police believe Pratibha Khan, 19, was dragged from her home by her father and brother before being beaten with bricks and strangled to death . A teenage girl was stoned to death in India and had her face 'smashed beyond recognition' by her father and brother after she was caught dating a boy from a neighbouring village. The bloodied remains of Pratibha Khan, 19, were found by friends in the fields near her home in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state. Investigators say she was dragged there by father Jagpal, 65, and oldest brother Pradeep, 36, who were angry she was dating a boy from a nearby village, before being attacked. Officers believe the girl was beaten with bricks and stones before being strangled to death, and that more injuries were inflicted after she had died in an attempt to hide her identity. Alia Modi, 18, a friend of Miss Khan, said: 'I was walking home through the fields when I saw a body lying on the ground. 'It was covered in blood and when I looked at the face it was so badly damaged I didn't recognise it as Pratibha's. It was only later that I learnt who it was and I was simply horrified.' A police spokesman said: 'The post-mortem report showed that while the cause of death was strangulation, it appeared that she had been repeatedly struck by bricks and stones. 'Perhaps to hide her identity, some of the blunt force injuries to her face were made after her death, but most weren't.' 'It looks like the brother and father dragged her to the fields and assaulted her with bricks and stones. They then strangled her and went on to smash her face beyond recognition.' Speaking about the arrests, the spokesman added: 'An analysis of her mobile phone records pointed to the involvement of her family members, in particular the brother and father. 'Initially, her brother Pradeep was questioned and claimed she was killed by her lover. Miss Khan's older brother Pradeep, 36 (left), and father Jagpal, 65, have been charged with her killing. Today another of her brothers, Prabhat, 33, said he was 'neither sorry nor surprised that my sister is dead' 'It was only later when we interrogated Pradeep and his father Jagpal separately that we were able to find inconsistencies in their statements. 'Eventually they admitted that they had killed her because she was in love with another boy from a nearby village.' One of the girl's other brothers Prabhat, 33, said: 'I am neither sorry nor surprised that my sister is dead.

"Former Marine: Ian Couch, 54, of Cambridgeshire, sent the offensive messages in a drunken rage . A former UK Independence Party candidate faced jail today for emailing racist slurs to a mosque and posting a photograph of a pig’s head on Facebook. Ex-Marine Ian Couch, 54, sent the offensive messages in a drunken rage after becoming angry at TV reports of the beheading of journalist James Foley by ISIS militants. Couch, a former counter terrorism operative, also posted racial slurs on Facebook alongside a picture of a pig’s head he kept in his fridge. Police seized the head when they raided his home in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, and Couch claimed he had bought it for his dogs. The court heard Couch made anti-Muslim comments such as ‘your religion is a disgrace’, ‘how many heads do you have as a trophy’ and ‘the sooner we destroy Islam the better’. And among his posts on Facebook was one that said: ‘Isn't it funny that they can cut off women and children’s heads but can't touch a pig's?’ Couch denied two counts of sending offensive messages and claimed he had a right to freedom of expression. But magistrates rejected this in Cambridge last Thursday and told Couch he faced jail. Presiding magistrate Marisa Johnson said his actions were ‘indefensible’. She said: ‘We find the email was offensive. We are offended by it and it had the intention of causing offence and distress to the people who received it. Image: A  pig's head photo posted on Couch's Facebook page. The court heard his actions were 'indefensible' 'You are in a very serious situation, particularly at these volatile and serious times. We consider it a hate crime and are looking at a custodial sentence with a six-week starting point. ‘We can’t tolerate this kind of behaviour from anyone which is likely to make matters worse for people in the community.’ Joe Bird, prosecuting, said Couch had stood as a Ukip candidate for South Cambridgeshire District Council last May but failed to be elected. Ms Johnson added: ‘You knew full well when you sent that email that it’s something they would find grossly offensive.’ Taxi driver Abdul Muquith, who volunteers as a receptionist at the Omar Faruque mosque in Cambridge, received the email in question. Another pig image posted on his Facebook page: Couch denied two counts of sending offensive messages . Couch had become angry at TV reports of the beheading of journalist James Foley (above) by ISIS militants . He told the court: ‘I was scared and very upset because we are quite a close-knit community in that area and we are responsible for the well-being and safety our congregation. Statement: A tie with pigs on it that Couch wore to an earlier court hearing linked to the offence. He claimed he had a right to freedom of expression . ‘I was shocked because we’d never received any emails in the past in that kind of language. We were scared that something might happen in the morning when he arrived.’ Mr Muquith then discovered a string of racist slurs on Couch’s Facebook page when he looked him up after receiving the initial email. He added: ‘There were pictures and a lot of language which was against Muslims and Islam and a lot of statements about putting pigs’ heads in the mosques. ‘There are no words to describe how shocking it was for me to see things like that on a Facebook page.’ After the case Paul Bullen, Ukip group leader for Cambridgeshire County Council, confirmed Couch was no longer a member of the party. He said: ‘When the party became aware that he was anti-Islamic and that he didn’t have our standards we asked him to leave, which he did immediately. ‘I believe his conviction is correct and his actions are damaging to the community. You can’t judge a religion on a few fanatics.’ The case was adjourned for sentencing at the same court at a future date.","Ian Couch, of Cambridgeshire, sent offensive messages in drunken rage .

"Health officials are investigating a sudden fall in life expectancy amongst the elderly which is particularly stark in women. There is concern it has been triggered by declining hospital care, a lack of GP appointments and cuts to home-help. The alarm was raised by public health bosses in the North West who noted that that life expectancy aged 85 was ‘going backwards’. Public health bosses in the North West noted that life expectancy aged 85 was 'going backwards'. In one local authority, it had dropped from living a further 6.8 years aged 85 in 2011 to just 6.5 years (file photo) And the trend was particularly pronounced for elderly women where, in one local authority, it had dropped from living a further 6.8 years aged 85 in 2011 to just 6.5 years. Public Health England – the Government agency responsible for preventing early death – confirmed the fall in women’s life expectancy had occurred across the country and it was carrying out further analysis to establish the reasons. But senior doctors and MPs are worried it is the beginning of a long-term trend brought about by cuts to the NHS and social care. The email which triggered the investigation – leaked to Health Service Journal - was sent by Dominic Harrison, Director of Public Health in Blackburn with Darwen council, to Public Health England at the end of last month. It reads: ‘I just wanted to alert you to the fact that it may now be likely that in many LA (local authority) areas in the NW (North West)/England are no longer living longer.’ ‘This effect is statistically significant, sustained and (probably) preventable!’ It goes on to warn that such a ‘sustained’ reduction in life expectancy is ‘extremely unusual’ and should send out a public health ‘alarm’. The email lists possible causes such as cuts to basic fall-prevention services and meals and wheels as well as worsening GP and hospital care. Senior doctors and MPs are worried it is the beginning of a long-term trend brought about by cuts to the NHS and social care (file photo) Senior doctors are unsure as to why the fall has occurred in women and not men but believe it could be the start of a long-term trend affecting both sexes. Dr John Middleton, vice president of the Faculty of Public Health , which represents 3,000 doctors and other specialists said: ‘I am concerned about these figures. ‘The obvious concern is about shortcomings in social care which is related to the current debate on accident and emergency . Liz Kendall MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Care and Older People, said: ‘This Government’s cuts to adult social care are having a devastating impact. Half a million fewer people are now getting vital care services, which means more are ending up in hospital or getting stuck in hospital when they don’t need to be there. Professor John Newton, Chief Knowledge Officer at Public Health England acknowledged that although there had been a fall in life expectancy in women in 2012, early analysis suggested it hadn’t continued into 2013. Figures from the Office for National Statistics for England show that life expectancy aged 85 for women has dropped from 6.85 years in 2009-11 to 6.83 years in 2011-13. For men it has continued to rise – although at a slower pace than previously - from 5.81 years to 5.83 years over the same period (file photo) Referring to possible causes, he added: ‘[It is] influenced by many factors and has fluctuated from year to year in the past. ‘However, Public Health England is currently conducting further analysis of these trends and we hope to make the findings available in the near future.’ Figures from the Office for National Statistics for England show that life expectancy aged 85 for women has dropped from 6.85 years in 2009-11 to 6.83 years in 2011-13. For men it has continued to rise – although at a slower pace than previously – from 5.81 years to 5.83 years over the same period. But in certain areas including Blackburn it fell last year in men from 5.8 years in 2010-12 to 5.6 years in 2011-13. The figures are calculated as an average for three years – for example the most recent 2011-13 data being the average life expectancy for 2011, 2012 and 2013.","Dominic Harrison, Director of Public Health in Blackburn with Darwen council, sparked an investigation after an email of his was leaked .

"A widower was left devastated after losing a sentimental recording of his late wife’s voice in a phone service upgrade. Stan Beaton, 68, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, said he had been assured by Virgin Media that his much-treasured answer machine message form his wife, Ruby, was safe. However, following technical changes to his landline, the recording had disappeared from the system last December. Mr Beaton was shocked after being told the message, which was recorded on the machine over 14 years ago, had been deleted and was lost forever. Stan Beaton lost a precious recording of his late wife Ruby's (in photo) voice after Virgin Media upgraded his landline despite the company assuring him the voicemail message was safe . Mr Beaton was left devastated after being told Ruby's message, which was recorded on the machine more than 14 years ago, had been deleted and was lost forever. She died from stomach cancer in 2003 . 'Anytime I felt low, I knew I always had her voice near but now it is gone,' Mr Beaton, a retired forklift truck driver, said. 'I could not tell you how many times I listened to the message. It was just nice to hear her voice once again. In the early days, it would be every day but the hurt eases but it never goes away,' he said. When Virgin made some alterations to his service on December 20, Mr Beaton called technical support and was assured his wife's voice was safe. He later found out that he had been misinformed by the company and his wife's simple answer machine message, which asked callers to leave their name and number, was gone. Mr Beaton said that losing the recording of his wife was especially difficult to take since it happened just before Christmas, with the festive season bringing back fond memories. His wife Ruby, who worked at Fox's Biscuits in Batley, died from stomach cancer in May 2003, aged 63. She had previously recovered from breast cancer. Ruby had recorded the phone's welcome message two years before her death, and it was stored on the couple's landline phone. Mr Beaton's late wife Ruby (right) recorded the phone's welcome message two years before her death. 'Anytime I felt low, I knew I always had her voice near. But now it is gone,' said Mr Beaton, a retired forklift truck driver . Mr Beaton had even refused to move from Virgin Media, despite a better deal elsewhere, due to the fact the answer phone message would have been deleted. He said: 'Her death left a void in my life. I always used to come in and dial 1471, just because I felt like listening to her but I am unable to do this anymore. I tried to record it myself over the years but I am not the most technical person and could never hear Ruby's voice when I tried. 'To lose something so precious, ""sorry"" doesn't mean a thing. These big companies say they care about their customers but they don't really care about you at all. Virgin Media has called Mr Beaton to apologise while confirming their engineers tried everything to recover the message . 'I know I won't be the only one who this may have happened to. However, they say their engineers are unable to recover Ruby's message which is something I just simply have to accept.' Virgin Media have called Mr Beaton to apologise while confirming their engineers tried everything to recover the message. Mr Beaton has been offered Sky Sports channels free for a year and the company pledges to make a donation to Mr Beaton's favourite charities to make amends for the deletion of the message. He named Cancer Research, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital and cleft palate charity Operation Smile, all of which he donates to regularly. A Virgin Media spokeswoman said: 'The voicemail message was lost when we migrated the service to a new platform during a planned upgrade. 'One of the agents in our contact centre incorrectly advised Mr Beaton his voicemail message was safe. 'We've apologised to Mr Beaton for this and for any distress the loss of this message has caused.' Mr Beaton says he is still waiting to hear confirmation regarding the donation to his charities.","Stan Beaton's late wife Ruby recorded their phone's voicemail 14 years ago .

"If you are looking for somewhere to buy a holiday cottage abroad, Catalonia has been named the best place to buy, with high rental yields and great tourism. The Spanish region ranked high for return of investment alongside Orlando in Florida and New York City both in the US. Online holiday home insurance provider Schofields have compiled the most visited countries 2013, based on tourism figures and looked into the costs of purchasing property suitable for a family holiday let. They took into consideration house prices of the most popular destinations, the average rental income to work out return on investment for such a property. Phil Schofield of Schofields Holiday Home Insurance said: 'For those looking to invest in property, a holiday home is a great choice, especially abroad. Not only can you make money from rental incomes, but it also offers you an option to have somewhere to stay when you want a holiday. 'The returns of investment we found were good, especially when you consider how long you keep the property. Obviously when looking for property abroad, you need to be aware of local laws and any costs that might be incurred in the country you’re buying in.' The Village of Llessui near Sort in Lleida province in Catalonia would be a solid choice for buying a cottage . Orlando, Florida offers a great return on investment, at 16.7% after 25 weeks after purchasing based on rental and selling criteria . When looking into the best places you can buy a holiday home abroad, the research found that Catalonia in Spain ranks top for return of investment. Spain consistently sees high tourist numbers year after year, coming in third place in 2013 with 60.7 million visitors to the country. They also looked at the most popular regions for tourism in Spain for 2013 which were; Andalucia, Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Canary Islands. In Catalonia they found you could get 18.59 per cent return of investment on a holiday home property, the highest return of investment (ROI). Investors could see a potential gross rent each year of £26,215 which is based on occupancy over 25 weeks. This equates to an average of £1,048 weekly rental price, taking into consideration high and low season. The average two bed property suitable for a holiday let in Catalonia will cost in the region of  £140,981 (€177,000). The final figure does not include expenses for maintaining the property or local property charges in the region. These Victorian cottages in Thousand Island Park on Wellesley Island, New York may cost a fair amount, but the long-term will see solid income . In second place was Orlando, in Florida with a ROI of 16.7 per cent and potential rental income (gross) of £9,510 and an average weekly rental price of £380. The USA saw the second most visitors in 2013, with 69.8 million and the most popular states in the US for tourism include; Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and Orlando. In Orlando you would only need to spend around  or £56,791 ($91,000) for a two-bedroomed property suitable for a family holiday rental. Although France saw the most tourists in 2013 with 84.7 million visitors their return on investment was not as favourable, with the best region for rental yields is Provence (Marseille) with ROI being 9.67 per cent. The worst place for rental yields was China, although it saw 55.7 million tourists in 2013, possible rental income for its most popular regions is significantly lower than many other places. For maximum return of investment in China you would have to buy in the Xian region which offers 3.79 per cent ROI. The data was collected using tourism figures from 2013, average house prices for two bedroom, houses or apartments (depending on the region) and return of investment made before expenses for the holiday home being occupied for 25 weeks of the year. The figures also don’t include any possible tax being charged for the property or profits made.","Spanish region's cottages will offer more in the long-run to buyers .

"A couple booking a two-week holiday to Greece were left £600 out of pocket after they paid extra for a holiday bungalow, only to be put in a hotel room on arrival. Ken  Marlow, 68, and his wife Dorothy, 58, wanted to stay at the Belvedere Hotel on the Greek island of Skiathos, but were disappointed to be told by Thomas Cook that the rooms were fully booked. Instead, the holiday company offered the couple, from Moorside, Sunderland, a stay in a bungalow on the property for £578.86 more. Ken and Dorothy Marlow have received a full refund after they were overcharged by more than half of the overall booking for a bungalow they never even got to stay in . However, when the couple arrived at the resort, they were told the bungalows were fully booked and they would instead be placed in a double room. The Marlows complained when they got home and despite admitting the brochure was 'confusing', Thomas Cook initially refused to refund the full amount. Mr Marlow was contacted by Thomas Cook's customer relations department which admitted the brochure description was 'really confusing.' The pensioner was offered just £260 in vouchers or £209 in cash in a full and final settlement but neither amount covered what he had been overcharged. However, after local newspapers took up the battle, the couple have now been given an apology, refund, and compensation from Thomas Cook. The couple have accepted £700 after the company blamed a 'technical fault' for charging too much. The Marlows have been given a full refund, plus compensation after the booking blunder . Mr Marlow said: 'I went to the Thomas Cook shop to book a holiday with a twin/double room at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece. 'The sales assistant told me no twin/double rooms were available on our chosen dates. 'There was, however, a family bungalow for three or four persons but I would have to pay extra for under occupancy. 'Having studied the brochure we decided the Belvedere was where we wanted to stay, so I agreed, and looked forward to having a bit more room to spread out.' On arrival, however, it was a completely different story. Mr Marlow, said: 'We were told that no bungalows were available and that we would have to stay in a double room. 'This, of course, was what we had wanted all along but a holiday that should have cost £1,118 cost me, somehow, £1,696.86, meaning I was overcharged by £578.86. 'It seems Thomas Cook and the Belvedere were not using the same data and, therefore, there was wrong information in the brochure.' The company admitted in email correspondence that the brochure was 'confusing' but refused to compensate to the amount Mr Marlow had been overcharged. The Marlows, from Sunderland, arrived at the Belvedere Hotel & Bungalows at Achladies, Skiathos, Greece to be told their booking for a bungalow was not possible . A spokesman for the company said: 'At Thomas Cook we pride ourselves on offering the best value holidays in the market. We would like to express our apologies to Mr Marlow for the inconvenience of additional charges incurred while on holiday. 'These were due to a pricing discrepancy caused by a technical fault at the time of booking. 'Thomas Cook would like to reassure customers that such pricing errors are rare and a full investigation has been carried out to ensure that there are no further issues of this nature. 'We can confirm that Mr Marlow has now accepted a full refund for the extra costs and has stated that he is looking forward to booking his next holiday with Thomas Cook.' Thomas Cook said that that the difference between what Mr Marlow was charged and what he should have been charged had been fully refunded - despite the earlier refusal - and they had also offered a gesture of goodwill by way of apology. Mr Marlow said he was delighted with the result. 'They have refunded what I wanted all along and rounded the amount up to £700,' he added.","The Marlows booked holiday bungalow with Thomas Cook .

"A rising number of pregnant women in Brazil are choosing to give birth via Caesarean section to prevent permanent changes to their sex lives. The South American country's Ministry of Health is launching a crackdown on the so-called 'C-section epidemic' after new figures revealed 52 per cent of births are Caesareans. The National Health Agency (NAS) figures reveal 84 per cent of these deliveries take place in private hospitals, and are funded by health insurance policies. In state hospitals, 40 per cent of deliveries are via C-section. Figures from Brazil's National Health Agency reveal 52 per cent of births are via Caesarean section - almost four times the rate recommended by the World Health Organisation (file picture) The World Health Organisation recommends C-section delivery rates are no higher than 10 to 15 per cent of all deliveries. As with all surgery, C-sections carry a certain level of risk - the wound could become infected and the baby could develop breathing difficulties, for example. The rise in C-sections is being driven by womens' concerns over their sex lives post delivery, and unscrupulous doctors promoting the procedure to earn more in health insurance cases, experts said. Vera Fonseca, director of the Brazilian Federation of Gynecological Associations, told Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo: 'The Brazilian woman is concerned with her sexuality and fears that giving birth will alter the perineum [the area between the vagina and the anus], which is a myth.' In the US, just over 32 per cent of all births are Caesareans, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Arthur Chioro, Brazil's minister of health, called the country's obsession with C-sections a 'public health problem'. He said: 'The epidemic of Caesareans we see today in this country is unacceptable and there is no other way to treat it than as a public health problem. 'What's normal are normal births.' Mr Chioro added: 'We cannot accept C-sections performed on the basis of economic power or convenience. 'There is no justification (whether) financial, technical or scientific, that you can (argue for the) high rate of Caesarean sections in health insurance. Experts in Brazil said women are becoming increasingly concerned about their sex lives after giving birth, which is causing them to opt for C-sections (Rio de Janeiro is pictured) 'We have to reverse this situation that has developed in the country. The Caesarean epidemic today is unacceptable and there is no way to treat it merely as a public health problem.' In a bid to crackdown on doctors promoting the procedures to line their own pockets, health bosses now require all medics to inform the government of prenatal information on all births. And they will now no longer be able to book elective C-sections, only choosing the delivery method after a woman has gone into labour. Doctors will also be obliged to give patients information of the risks of performing C-sections, International Business Times reports. Under the requirements Mr Chioro announced, health insurance companies will have to provide patients with information about the percentage of Caesareans performed by individual doctors and hospitals. Failure to do so within 15 days will result in large fines. The new rules, which take force in six months, will affect the nearly 24 million Brazilian women who have private health plans that cover obstetric services.","In Brazil 52% of all births are via Caesarean section, figures have revealed .

"The leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia has refused to condemn the brutal attacks at the Charlie Hebdo offices this week, claiming his response should be a cause for celebration, not condemnation. In a statement released to the media, entitled We Will Not Abandon Our Prophet, the Hizb ut- Tahrir leader, Ismail Alwahwah, said the group's refusal to 'succumb to the woeful moral ambivalence of the West' should be seen as good news for Muslims, who must resist the vile and racist views of many European powers. He said the political response to the massacre in Paris was unprecedented and disproportionate when compared with how many lose their lives everyday. He also claimed that some political leaders have used the terrorist attacks for their own agenda. Uthman Badar, Hizb ut-Tahrir’s spokesperson, took said Muslims should ignore publications such as Charlie Hebdo .

While most Australian Muslims leader in Australia have criticised the massacre Hizb ut-Tahrir said Muslims 'do not need to be lectured about the sanctity of human life' and the political response shows a 'callous and calculated exploitation' to the recent attacks. The group previously supported Sydney siege hostage taker Man Haron Monis . In a Facebook post, Hizb ut- Tahrir's media representative br Uthman Badar claims Muslims should ignore provocative publications such as French magazine Charlie Hebdo and scholars and activists seeking to ridicule The Prophet. 'We should not fall for the provocative and bullying tactics of magazines like Charlie Hebdo and engage in vigilante style attacks. They are wrong, unwise and counterproductive. They fall into the trap of being used to further demonise Islam and justify draconian policies and an unjust foreign policy,' he said. The radical Islamic group had also previously supported Sydney siege hostage taker Man Haron Monis after he was convicted of sending hate letters to the families of dead soldiers. Uthman Badar agrivated many with his appearance on Lateline and his refusal to condemn the Islamic State . The group has refused to condemn the terrorist attacks on Paris this week .

"An obese mother was shocked into shedding a seven stone after a neighbour told her she looked like Buddha. Natalie White Doodson, 28, from Glossop, Derbyshire, wore a dress size 22 and weighed 17 stone 2lb when she was compared with the spiritual figure, often depicted as a tubby cross-legged man. But eight months after cutting out processed food, sugar and her crisps and chocolate habit she slimmed to a size eight and now weighs just ten stone. Scroll down for video . Natalie White Doodson was shamed into confronting her weight gain when a neighbour called her a 'Buddha' The property developer, hear on her wedding day with husband Gavin, hadn't weighed herself for five years . She said: 'I was so shocked when I heard the words ""fat little Buddha"" I knew I needed to do something about my weight. 'Now I'm a whole new person. It's the best feeling in the world knowing I'm not ""the fat one"" any more.' At her largest, Natalie was terrified of breaking furniture or getting stuck on swings at the playground because of her giant frame, even though she's only 5ft 5in. She even believed that her five-year-old daughter was embarrassed when she stood next to other mums, who were sometimes half her size, in the playground. The property developer had not weighed herself since her daughter was born and was self-conscious in front of her husband Gavin. But when in April 2014, as she rested on a wall, a neighbour said the words, 'You look like a fat little Buddha sitting there', she knew she had to act. Natalie's slim frame is swamped by her old clothes after losing seven stone on the Cambridge Weight Plan . Before dropping from a size 22 to a size eight, Natalie felt that her size embarrassed her young daughter . Natalie said: 'Just taking my little girl to the playground used to be a struggle - I was scared that I would get wedged on a slide or break a bench under my weight. 'I couldn't be the mum I wanted and I think my daughter was embarrassed that I was the fat mum at the school gates. 'When my neighbour nipped over and just said 'You look like a fat little Buddha sitting there Natalie,' it was the final straw. 'I know it wasn't meant to be cruel, it was just an off-hand comment, but it really hit home that I needed to take action. 'I signed up to do the Cambridge Weight Plan the next day and I've never looked back. I can't thank him enough now.' A neighbour's off-hand comment that she looked like 'a fat little Buddha' kickstarted an eight-month diet . Since going on her diet plan, Natalie has cut out all processed food, sugar and her unhealthy snacks . Natalie had tried Weight Watchers and a juice diet before to no avail but since a friend had slimmed down with the Cambridge Weight Plan, she signed up on the spur of the moment. 'I knew it would be hard but I cried when I got on the scales for the first time in five years and my consultant Caroline Robinson read out that I weighed more than 17 stone,' she said. BEFORE .

'But it really has turned out to be so simple. I don't know why I didn't do it before. 'I look at the labels on the things I used to have in my cupboards - all the chocolate, crisps and sweets - and can't believe I ever ate them. 'I used to think that all the bad stuff tasted so good. I've had to completely change the way I think to challenge my diet.' In the first week she lost 8lb after cutting out processed fats, sugars and snacks. In eight months she has dropped more than seven stone  and now has no fears about the being compared to a fat little statue. 'I still feel like a size 22 inside sometimes and I have to remind myself that I'm not. I don't look like a fat little Buddha any more - everyone says I look great. 'The weight came off so quickly that all my clothes were too big and I had nothing to wear. 'My friend runs a clothes shop called Girls and Curves and she donated outfits to fit my new figure.

"These are the four men killed in a drive-by shooting shooting as they sat in a stolen car in an upscale part of San Francisco. Authorities named David Saucier, 20,  Yalani Chinyamurindi, 19, Harith Atchan, 21, and Manuel O'Neal, 22 as the victims shot dead in Hayes Valley on Friday night. Police are yet to name any suspects in the killings, which police say involved shots fired from at least two and as many as four different guns. Victims: David Saucier, 20, (left) and Yalani Chinyamurrindi, 19, were both gunned down Friday . Shot dead: Harith Atchan, 21, (left) and Manuel Oneal, 22, (right) were also shot in the attack . Extra police patrols are in place, and the San Francisco Police Department's gang task force was put into action after well-heeled residents spoke of their shock at violence plaguing their neighborhood. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle, local Landon Fabianski said: 'I thought it was more of an upscale neighborhood. I never thought there would be a shooting of that nature here.' Heather Houston, 33, concurred, saying: 'It seems like such a nice, safe neighborhood.' The four men were shot dead a few blocks from San Francisco's golden domed City Hall where trendy cafes, antique stores and popular restaurants continue to open in a neighborhood long plagued by gang violence. Ten men and a woman are currently in jail awaiting trial on federal charges of murder, racketeering and a host of other counts connected to a gang authorities say is based in the neighborhood. It is not clear whether the gang is involved in these killings. Community leaders assembled at the African American Culture Center Monday said parents and residents were afraid of more violence in reprisal for the killings and were keeping their children inside. Attack: The men were sitting in a car, shown left with bullet holes, when the attack came. Police now say the vehicle was stolen . Emergency: Police and ambulances are pictured above responding to the shooting . 'Our community is bleeding,' said Mattie Scott, a community activist whose 24-year-old son was slain in the same neighborhood in 1996. 'Fear is a major issue right now.' A makeshift memorial of candles, flowers and handwritten signs appeared on the sidewalk next to where the shooting occurred across the street from the Samovar Tea Lounge and the San Francisco Zen Center. Two bullet holes remained visible in an empty store front. Graffiti mourning one of the men slain was spray painted on a nearby apartment building. A prayer vigil was scheduled for late Monday at the center. Yalini Chinyamurindi's mother told the Chronicle her son was at the 'wrong place at the wrong time.' Asale-Haqueenyah Chandler said her son worked at a nearby Japanese restaurant, was on his 30-minute break, and was headed to a liquor store to cash his paycheck. 'He called his friend to pick him up,' Chandler said. 'He only had a half hour. He wanted to give me some money toward our rent and save money for a car.' Witnesses reported more than a dozen shots were fired into the double-parked car. 'I heard 'pop, pop,' about 15 times in quick succession,' said Jason Palmer, who was walking his dog two blocks away when the killings occurred. Palmer, an actor who moved to San Francisco 18 months ago, said the neighborhood is plagued with graffiti and crime.","Four named, including David Saucier, 20, and Yalani Chinyamurindi, 19 .

"A 23-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly killing his girlfriend's two-year-old son by jumping up and down on his chest, shaking him and slamming his head into a window sill. Mirsad Hamidovic reportedly attacked the toddler, named Lorenzo, at an apartment complex in Kansas City, Missouri, in the early hours of Friday morning while the child's mother was at work. He repeatedly jumped on the youngster's chest 'with his forearms in front of him', crushing him, possibly knocking his head into a window sill and causing him to vomit blood, police said. As Lorenzo  lost consciousness, Hamidovic then allegedly violently shook him to wake him up. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Mirsad Hamidovic (left), 23, has been arrested after allegedly killing his girlfriend's two-year-old son, Lorenzo (right), by jumping up and down on his chest, shaking him and slamming his head into a window sill . Following the alleged assault, Lorenzo was rushed to hospital with serious head and brain injuries, including bruising on his brain,  court documents state. He was also suffering from a lacerated liver. The boy was placed on life support. But despite medics' best efforts, he passed away on Sunday. While Lorenzo was dying in hospital, Hamidovic was arrested and charged with two counts of felony child abuse and two counts of first-degree domestic assault, according to KCTV 5. These charges will likely be upgraded now that the boy has died. Tragic: Mirsad Hamidovic reportedly attacked Lorenzo (pictured) at an apartment in Kansas City, Missouri, in the early hours of Friday morning while the child's mother was at work. The boy passed away on Sunday . Scene: In an interview with police, Hamidovic apparently admitted to jumping on Lorenzo's chest at least twice as the boy lay on his back on a bed at the apartment on the 1700 block of Washington Avenue (pictured) In an interview with police, Hamidovic apparently admitted to jumping on Lorenzo's chest at least twice as the boy lay on his back on a bed, with his head partially on a window sill, at around 3am. 'The suspect jumped up in the air and came down on the victim's chest and the victim's head may have hit the window sill,' according to court documents obtained by the news station. 'The suspect said the victim was on his back on the ground when the suspect jumped off the bed up in the air and came down on the victim's chest with his forearms in front of him. 'He did this twice. The suspect stated the victim was coughing up blood and he cleaned the blood off the victim's mouth in a panic.' The toddler then fell unconscious, it is reported. When Lorenzo failed to wake up, Hamidovic allegedly started violently shaking the toddler, causing his head and arms to flail around, before placing him under a cold shower. In a panic, he then ran down the hallway at the Nottingham Apartments, situated on the 1700 block of Washington Avenue, shouting for help, with Lorenzo lying limp in his arms. Several neighbors tried desperately to resuscitate the toddler before paramedics arrived. It is not clear whether Hamidovic, or one of his neighbors, dialed 911. Neighbor: Several neighbors tried desperately to resuscitate the toddler before paramedics arrived at the scene. One, Gena Gutierrez (pictured) said of Lorenxo: 'He wasn't breathing, so I started breathing into him' Resident Gena Gutierrez, who performed CPR on Lorenzo, said: 'The baby was stone cold, turning blue. I put him on the ground and he wasn't breathing, so I started breathing into him.' She added: 'It breaks my heart. God knows I tried to do what I could. I feel real sorry for the mom.' Hamidovic, who has three biological children that he often sees, is being held on a cash-only $500,000 bond, according to KSHB. He is due to appear in court on January 28.

"They have graced the silver screen for many years. Watching them at the Golden Globes, however, you might have mistaken them for young ingenues. Despite being well into their forties and beyond, with their plump cheeks and smooth complexions some of Hollywood’s elder stateswomen look suspiciously younger than their years. Julianne Moore, who picked up the Golden Globe for best actress for her performance in the film Still Alice, barely seemed to have changed since her first victory at the ceremony 21 years ago.

Miss Lopez said last year that she is ‘terrified’ of plastic surgery and vowed to never go under the knife. Miss Zeta-Jones, who is married to Michael Douglas, has been dogged by persistent rumours of plastic surgery but these have never been fully confirmed.

"Traffic flowed again Monday on the Golden Gate Bridge, after a weekend closure to install a safety barrier designed to reduce dangers of head-on crashes. The bridge reopened at 9:30 p.m. Sunday, more than six hours ahead of schedule, said Priya Clemens, a spokeswoman for the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District. For the longest period in its nearly 80-year history, the bridge was closed early Saturday to all but pedestrians, cyclists and buses to install the barriers on the 1.7-mile-long bridge. Previously, only yellow plastic tubes offered protection from opposing traffic. Since 1970, there have been 128 head-on collisions on the bridge - resulting in 16 deaths, according to Clemens.

Bridge officials said early Monday that traffic was moving over the bridge with no problems. A survivor of a 2008 head-on crash on the bridge spoke earlier Sunday from her wheelchair to help inaugurate the new barrier, made of steel-clad concrete blocks that can move across the span's six lanes to accommodate traffic demands. Dr. Grace Dammann, who pushed for a safer median barrier since becoming paralyzed from the crash, said she decided to drive in the 'suicide lane' because she and her daughter were running late. Brian Clark, who was driving in the opposite direction, had just learned his father had terminal cancer. 'He passed out at the wheel, crossed over and hit my car,' Dammann recalled. She said she and Clark became friends as they urged the district to approve the $30 million barrier. 'I am so grateful,' said Dammann, who came to the ribbon-cutting ceremony with Clark. 'Brian and I thank you.' The suspension bridge opened in 1937, and previously has closed only for shorter periods, including for celebrations and work projects. Ahead of her speech, Damman told The New York Times  'Life turns on a dime. And if we can make it a gentler landing for people, that’s good. That’s my prayer.' The bridge's closing caused problems for some weddings and birthday parties, as well as businesses, the newspaper reported. 'Having this barrier here — you hate to say never — but it prevents head-on collisions,' bridge manager Kary Witt told SFGate ahead of the ribbon-cutting completed by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). The website explained that the 'suicide lane' is the lane closest to the left, and that Zipper Trucks will shuffle the barrier around as needed. The barrier measures 11,500 feet in length and features 3,517 pieces, SFGate reported. Rep. Speier (D-San Mateo) was quoted by the website as saying  'You can’t prevent all automobile accidents, but you can prevent head-on automobile accidents and serious injuries and deaths on the Golden Gate Bridge.

"Should the day ever come when I am asked to perform an after-dinner party trick, I have just the thing prepared: a word-perfect rendition of Master Of The House from the musical Les Miserables. All 125 lines of it. If the assembled company want an encore — and they won’t, for I cannot sing in tune — I could also do I Dreamed A Dream, One Day More, Do You Hear The People Sing? and A Heart Full of Love. If Les Mis weren’t to the party’s taste, I could do a medley of numbers from Cats, Oliver!, Miss Saigon, Phantom Of The Opera or any of a dozen West End musicals. For there are few things I enjoy as much as a high-kicking, leotard-slinking, barricade-mounting, chandelier-crashing, helicopter-blade-whirring, big-budget West End musical. Meryl Streep plays the Witch in the new film version of Stephen Sondheim's  Into the Woods. Emily Blunt and James Corden also star. Freeman said the big show-stopper Children Will Listen makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up . While others may flee up the aisles at the first sign that an adorable urchin is about to break into song, I am slap-bang in the middle of the front row clutching my programme, tapping my foot to the music and singing under my breath. It doesn’t have to be a stage show. A Disney or Rodgers and Hammerstein film — The King And I, The Sound Of Music — will do the trick. Or just the soundtrack listened to through headphones, causing least distress to others. There has rarely been a better time to be a fan of musicals. We are enjoying a particularly purple patch. It was announced recently that producer Cameron Mackintosh is to make a new film of the musical Oliver! with star ballet choreographer Matthew Bourne. Meanwhile, the musical adaptation of the film Made In Dagenham, starring Bond Girl Gemma Arterton as a factory worker crusading for equal pay, has been nominated for a host of awards at the Adelphi Theatre in London. Cats has opened to rave reviews (‘Mi-wow!’, ‘Purr-fect!’ ‘The cat’s whiskers!’) at the Palladium, with The X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger singing Memory, the show’s big ballad. Nicole Scherzinger stars in the cast of Cats at the London Palladium. The show has opened to rave reviews . The Stephen Sondheim musical Assassins has just opened at London’s Menier Chocolate Factory, starring comedian Catherine Tate. Imelda Staunton — a veteran of Sweeney Todd and Guys And Dolls — is soon to arrive in the West End as Mama Rose in Sondheim’s Gypsy after an acclaimed run at the Chichester Festival Theatre. An updated Annie with a hip-hop soundtrack opened in cinemas on Boxing Day, which was followed last week by Into The Woods, a film adaptation of another Sondheim great — the Broadway musical sending up traditional fairytales. It stars Meryl Streep as the Witch, Johnny Depp as the Big Bad Wolf, and James Corden and Emily Blunt as the hapless Baker and his Wife. Musical heaven! I cannot remember a time when I didn’t love musicals. The person to thank, or possibly blame, was the wonderful nanny, a proper Poppins, who came when I was three and my brother was one, and stayed for a decade. She arrived, not descending from the sky holding a parrot-headed umbrella, but in a little white Vauxhall with a glovebox full of cassettes. It was she who introduced us to the soundtracks of Les Mis (still my favourite), Cats, Oliver!, Kiss Me, Kate, Grease, West Side Story, My Fair Lady, Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Bugsy Malone, Evita and Blood Brothers. We listened to them on the school run until the tapes unspooled. I have never, however, suffered the delusion of The X Factor auditionee. There was not a moment, even when I was very young, when I thought I could be Grizabella or Eva Peron, Tallulah or Nancy. Disney's Frozen, released in 2013 and starring Idina Menzel, is the highest grossing animated film of all time . Freeman grew up in a decade when Disney produced some of its greatest musicals, and understands hy little girls today watch Disney’s latest musical Frozen dozens of times and sing its anthem Let It Go . But I have always loved listening to those who can sing the socks off an audience. I was lucky to grow up in a decade when Disney produced some of its greatest musicals. The Little Mermaid opened in 1989, when I was two. Beauty And The Beast followed in 1991 and Aladdin in 1992. In 1995, The Lion King won awards for best score and best original song (Elton John’s Can You Feel The Love Tonight?) at the Oscars. Hercules was in cinemas in 1997, Mulan in 1998. And then, the studio went off the boil. Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Wall-E were all hits in the Noughties, but not one was a musical. Disney didn’t come up with another film you could really sing-a-long to until Enchanted in 2007. Hollywood starlet Amy Adams plays Giselle, a cartoon princess who wakes up in modern Manhattan. When Giselle sings an aria to summon the dear little birds and creatures of the forest in the traditional Disney princess manner, she finds herself surrounded by the city’s rats, mice, pigeons and cockroaches. Amy Adams in Enchanted. Disney didn’t come up with another film you could really sing-a-long to until the 2007 film. Freeman went to see it in the cinema four times because the songs were so hummable . The songs were so hummable I went to the cinema to see it four times — the only time I’ve made multiple trips to see one film. I can understand why little girls today watch Disney’s latest musical Frozen dozens of times and sing its anthem Let It Go, which has been watched nearly 300 million times on YouTube, until their parents beg for mercy. When it comes to the musicals that endure on stage, there is a curious truth: the more improbable the source material, the greater the success. The writers of The Producers got it spot on when they imagined a pair of shysters putting on a musical about the rise of the Nazi party that is certain to fail, in order to make off with the investors’ money. The best-laid plans inevitably go awry and Springtime For Hitler is a smash hit. Les Miserables is based on a 1,200-page Victor Hugo novel about the wretchedness of the poor in 19th-century France. Cats was inspired by a collection of children’s poems by T. S. Eliot, whose most famous work The Wasteland, an epic modernist poem, has baffled scholars for decades. Oliver Twist, which inspired the musical Oliver!, is one of Charles Dickens’ nastier books. The death of Nancy is particularly brutal, and there’s not a word about singing milkmaids or dancing pickpockets. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in the 2012 movie adaptation of Les Miserables. Freeman believes the curious true of musicals is that the more improbable the source material, the greater the success . Anne Hathaway as Fantine. The film is based on a 1,200-page Victor Hugo novel about the wretchedness of the poor in 19th-century France . The really great musicals — those that run for 25 years and sell hundreds of thousands of albums — have a peculiar alchemy of music and lyrics. They send you home singing. When I saw Matilda, the fizzingly brilliant musical adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s book, I had the show’s big number, When I Grow Up, on my mind for weeks after. Of the current crop, I had most been looking forward to Into The Woods. Last month, I inveigled my way into a screening. I walked home afterwards, hardly noticing the Christmas shoppers, singing (quietly) to myself the whole way. Sondheim’s score whips along. The lyrics are witty and ludicrous — only he would try to find a rhyme for ‘arugula’, a type of salad leaf. The big show-stopper Children Will Listen makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. I cried with laughter when, from the top of a waterfall, Hollywood pretty boy Chris Pine, playing a dim-witted Prince Charming, belted out Agony, a lament about being thwarted in the pursuit of his Cinderella. It isn’t perfect. Depp is no tenor and nor is Corden. Meryl Streep, a veteran of the Abba musical Mamma Mia!, falls short of Bernadette Peters, who played the Witch in the first Broadway cast. I’ve had the original album for years. Some of the songs — according to my computer — have been played more than 300 times. The joy of a musical — and this is the test for all those opening in the coming months — is that it should send you home humming, tapping your feet and, in the best Gene Kelly manner, even swinging from lamp-posts while singin’ in the rain.","There has rarely been a better time to be a fan of musicals .

"Tragic: Police say Southeast Missouri State University student Bobby Christman was gunned down after engaging with an armed carjacker early Sunday . A 19-year-old was shot in the head and killed when he tried to stop robbers from taking his girlfriend's purse in downtown St. Louis, police say. Authorities say Bobby Christman was unconscious when officers arrived early Sunday morning to the scene. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the Southeast Missouri State University student was sitting inside a parked car with two other people. Authorities say a vehicle pulled up next to their car and a man got out with a handgun. Police say the armed man opened a door and tried to grab a purse belonging to Christman's girlfriend, leading to a tug of war with the criminal. 'She offered some level of resistance,' said St. Louis Metropolitan Police Captain Michael Sack told Fox2Now. 'At that time the front right passenger had said something. He had made some kind of remark and at that time the suspect filed a single shot at that front right passenger.' Christman's 17-year-old brother also witnessed the horrific murder. According to KSDK, the suspects subsequently engaged police in a gunfight in nearby Washington Park. Three suspects then escaped on foot. Now police are using evidence gathered from the silver getaway car, which they have recovered, to try and find clues to who killed Christman. Bullet casings were found inside and the car is being dusted for prints. Christman, right, was killed while trying to stop robbers who were after his girlfriend's purse . Perished: Authorities say Christman said something to the gunman, who then fired the shot that struck Christman. They say the gunman jumped into his silver car and fled.

His heartbroken fraternity brother Paul Wibbenmeyer said, 'We're going to miss a great role model...It just breaks my heart' Police say the suspects' car had been stolen in a carjacking days before. They are looking to businesses in the area in hopes of finding footage of the thieves or a witness to their crimes. Christman belonged to the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at SEMU. His fraternity brother there Aaron Clite told KDKA he wasn't completely surprised to hear of Christman's bravery. 'I was happy I got to see him in his final day. He was just such an amazing person. He fought, he held on and for someone to survive even an event like that and be able to hang on as long as he did, it was amazing. He fought for his life and he did it all the way to the end,' he said. Another fraternity brother, Paul Wibbenmeyer, told KFVS: . 'We're going to miss a great role model,' he said. 'It just breaks my heart.' Christman's university has also issued a statement on the tragedy. Photos from Christman's Facebook reveal a fun loving teen whose adult life had only just begun. Among the family he left behind was a 14-year-old sister and 17-year-old brother who reportedly witnessed the crime . The incident occurred early Sunday morning on the streets of downtown St. Louis when a thief leaped from a stolen car and demanded Christman's girlfriend give up her purse . 'This is a tragic loss of life and we deeply mourn the death of Robert. We ask that everyone keep his family in their thoughts and prayers,' executive director of university communications and marketing at Southeast Missouri State Jeff Harmon said. Christman's father Bob Christman II told STLToday that his son died trying to protect his friend. 'He was very protective,' the Christman said.

"Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has compared the  attack on French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo to the Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany. The 62-year-old said the Charlie Hebdo attack and the hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in Paris last week 'draws a parallel to the horrors of the Nazis'. Weinstein also appeared to be defending the US's sometimes controversial anti-terror measures, writing that we 'must sympathise with the Secret Service' even though there will be 'casualties'. Film exec Harvey Weinstein, pictured at last night's Golden Globes After Party with Taylor Swift, Este Haim, Jaime King, and Lorde, has compared the Paris attacks to the Nazi attacks against Jews during WWII . In a column for entertainment-trade magazine Variety, the film producer and executive, who was raised in a Jewish family in New York, writes: 'The tragedy in France is a stunning blow against freedom of speech and freedom of joy. 'It draws a parallel to the horrors of the Nazis and their mad attempt at Kristallnacht to destroy books. 'These are the works of fanatics - irrational thinking and scapegoating to compensate for misappropriated ideas. This has become a fight, good versus evil. This is a time for nations to unite, to share information and realize we live in a world where technology has evened the score and made the bad guys even more dangerous.' Harvey Weinstein, pictured last night with wife and Georgina Chapman, also defended the war on terror . In defence of the war on terror, he continued: 'Now we have to use our technology and share things to make the good guys better, more capable, more efficient. 'No one's talking about torture or the violation of human rights, but for God's sake we have to sympathize with our Secret Service and the other organizations of men and women protecting our safety daily. 'We have to know there will be mistakes and casualties along the way, but we the people have to support those who protect us, more than ever. 'Let the humor, the wisdom, of Charlie Hebdo live, by us winning the war that they fought on the pages of their beautiful newspaper. 'Laughter and satire will never disappear, and will always be the most effective tools for a free world. Weinstein's column was published the day after one of the surviving Charlie Hebdo cartoonists said the publication 'vomit on all these people who suddenly say they are our friends'. Bernard Holtrop, who uses the pen name Willem, was not in the office during the massacre on Wednesday which killed eight of his colleagues and four other victims. 'It really makes me laugh,' he told the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant. 'A few years ago, thousands of people took to the streets in Pakistan to demonstrate against Charlie Hebdo. They didn't know what it was. Now it's the opposite.' Jihadist brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi shot dead eight members of staff and many of the magazine's top cartoonists, in the attack against Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday. Editor Stephane Charbonnier, known as Charb, a guest editor, a maintenance worker and two police officers were also gunned down. The pair were killed during a stand-off between police on the outskirts of the city on Friday after they took refuge in a printworks.","Harvey Weinstein compares Charlie Hebdo attack to Kristallnacht .

"Many people are guilty of oversharing on Facebook, but even the most reserved users may be giving away more about their personality than they realise. By ‘mining’ for Likes on the social network, software has been developed that can accurately predict how open, conscientious, outgoing and neurotic an individual user is. And, in the majority of cases, these predictions were found to be more accurate than those made by close friends and family.

Analysis of the data revealed which Likes equated with higher levels of particular traits. The results of the computerised character assessment were then compared with judgements of friends and family members made using a shorter version of the personality test. Given enough Likes, the software was able to match people’s self-reported personality traits more closely than siblings, parents or friends. In particular, the researchers found their software could to predict a participant’s personality more accurately than a work colleague from analysing just 10 Likes. Inputting 70 Likes allowed it to obtain a truer picture of someone’s character than a friend or room-mate, while 150 Likes outperformed a parent or sibling. It took 300 Likes before the programme was able to judge character better than a spouse, though.

Given that an average Facebook user has about 227 Likes, the researchers said this kind of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to know us better than our closest companions. ‘In the future, computers could be able to infer our psychological traits and react accordingly, leading to the emergence of emotionally-intelligent and socially skilled machines,’ said Ms Youyou. ‘In this context, the human-computer interactions depicted in science fiction films such as Her seem to be within our reach.’ In Her, starring Joaquin Phoenix, a man develops a close relationship with an intelligent computer operating system called Samantha, personified by a female voice. But the scientists admit there may be concerns about privacy as such technology develops, and say they support policies giving users full control over their digital footprint. Analysis of the data revealed which Likes equated with higher levels of particular traits. For instance, liking Salvador Dali (picutred) , TED talks, or pages about meditation revealed a high degree of openness. The results of the computerised assessment were compared with judgements of friends and family members . The software predicted a participant’s personality more accurately than a colleague using just 10 Likes. Inputting 70 Likes allowed it to obtain a truer picture of character than a friend, while 150 Likes outperformed a parent or sibling. It took 300 Likes before the software could judge character better than a spouse, though . The work, reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, builds on a previous study by Cambridge University scientists which showed that a variety of psychological and demographic characteristics can be predicted through Facebook Likes. Co-author Dr David Stillwell, also from Cambridge University, added: ‘The ability to judge personality is an essential component of social living - from day-to-day decisions to long-term plans such as whom to marry, trust, hire, or elect as president. ‘The results of such data analysis can be very useful in aiding people when making decisions.’ People with higher levels of extraversion commonly Liked reality TV star Snooki (pictured), and pages about dancing, according to the research. Given that an average Facebook user has about 227 Likes, the researchers said this kind of software has the potential to know people better than their closest companions . Lead researcher Wu Youyou said: ‘In this context, the human-computer interactions depicted in science fiction films such as Her seem to be within our reach.’ In Her, starring Joaquin Phoenix, (pictured) a man develops a close relationship with an operating system personified by a female voice, called Samantha . Phd student Ms Youyou continued: ‘Recruiters could better match candidates with jobs based on their personality; products and services could adjust their behaviour to best match their users’ characters and changing moods. ‘People may choose to augment their own intuitions and judgments with this kind of data analysis when making important life decisions such as choosing activities, career paths, or even romantic partners. ‘Such data-driven decisions may well improve people’s lives.’","More than 86,220 Facebook users completed a personality questionnaire .
