"(CNN) -- Today they are lawmakers, professors and grandparents. But 50 years ago, they were the young faces of the civil rights movement, who headed to the nation's capital -- even if it meant hitchhiking -- to be a part of history. These men and women joined nearly a quarter of a million others from across the country to take part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. Some even had chance encounters with civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The most famous moment of the march was King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, which he delivered from a podium at the Lincoln Memorial to a crowd of an estimated 210,000 people. Photographer captures faces of the march . Many thought the event would descend into violence, but it did not. There were 5,000 police officers, National Guardsmen and Army Reservists present, but no marchers were arrested, and no incidents concerning marchers were reported. The march was the culmination of the civil rights movement, and it is credited for helping spur lawmakers to pass the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. There were civil rights leaders, Hollywood celebrities and thousands of ordinary people who knew it was time for the United States to give the same rights to everyone, regardless of race. CNN caught up with a few of those marchers today. Bernice King's difficult journey . Patricia Worthy . Patricia Worthy was a college student just looking for a summer job when she got hired as the receptionist at the March on Washington planning office. ""I don't think I had a title,"" Worthy recalled. ""I answered the phones."" She had 10 phone lines to answer, and they rang from the time she walked in until she left for the day. ""I recall one day I'll never forget, I heard someone say, 'Where is this young lady who handles the phone?' And finally I looked up, and there he was -- Dr. King -- and he said, 'I want to meet this young lady. She has put me on the hold twice, and hung up on me once, and I want to know who she is.' "" Worthy said she was ""so embarrassed,"" but then the civil rights icon gave her a hug. By the day of the march, she was so tired, she dozed off and accidentally slept through the historic march and the ""I Have a Dream"" speech. After a career practicing law -- including a case involving the government's wiretapping of King -- Worthy has been a law professor at Howard University since 2004. Lessons from successful movements . John Lewis . At 23 years old, John Lewis was the youngest speaker at the March on Washington and probably the most controversial. He had just been elected to lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Lewis' father was a sharecropper in rural Alabama, where he grew up and went to segregated schools. According to his biography, Lewis ""was inspired by the activism surrounding the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., which he heard on radio broadcasts."" His prepared text for the March on Washington included a threat to march through the South like Gen. William Sherman during the Civil War unless there was progress on civil rights. That didn't sit well with his fellow civil rights leaders. ""On the night of August 27, 1963, I received a note under my door from (march organizer) Bayard Rustin saying, in effect, that there was some concern about my speech,"" Lewis said. ""My speech was pretty strong."" Another march organizer, A. Philip Randolph, also asked Lewis to edit his speech. ""And Mr. Randolph came and said, 'John, we come this far together. Can you change this? Can you delete that? Let's stay together,' "" Lewis recalled. So he did. Today, Lewis, 73, is the only surviving speaker. He has represented Georgia in the U.S. Congress for 14 consecutive terms. Some days, he still walks down to the Lincoln Memorial to stand where they all once stood. MLK memorial ready for anniversary . Robert Avery . Robert Avery knew the dark side of the civil rights movement. A month after the student protests in Birmingham, Alabama, turned violent, Avery -- 15 years old at the time -- joined anti-segregation demonstrations in Gadsden, Alabama. Police responded with force, cracking down with batons and prods, and arresting more than 460. Avery still lives with burn scars from a cattle prod. Months later, Avery and two of his friends were determined to get to Washington for the March on Washington. They couldn't afford to make the trip via traditional means, so they decided to hitchhike the 700 miles between Gadsden and the nation's capital. They walked at least a dozen miles up a dark highway before they got their first ride. After three days of hitchhiking, they arrived in Washington a week before the march. The three youths were put to work making signs for the march at the local headquarters. That weekend, a civil rights leader walked in and asked for them. He had been in Gadsden the night before, and their parents wanted him to check on them. King sat down with the three and talked to them for perhaps 20 minutes, asking them about their dreams. Today, Avery continues to serve as a city councilman in Gadsden, a position he has held since 1986. The only class MLK taught . Harry Belafonte . Harry Belafonte, a popular actor and Grammy Award-winning singer in the 1960s, used his star power to help bring other celebrities to the March on Washington. ""For myself personally -- beyond raising money, beyond speaking at events that helped to raise money to bring citizens to the Mall -- my task, my larger task, was to organize a cultural contingency to come to the March on Washington,"" Belafonte reflected. Besides reaching out to the stars themselves, Belafonte went to many of the studio heads in Hollywood to get prominent actors and actresses temporarily released from their duties so they could participate. He was successful. The Hollywood list of attendees that day read like a who's who of A-listers: Marlon Brando, Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Sammy Davis Jr., Charlton Heston and Burt Lancaster, who also gave a speech. But having the Hollywood stars there wasn't just for show or for increased media attention. It also helped calm President John F. Kennedy's nerves about the march. ""I believe that their presence did a lot to assuage people who are preoccupied with the fact there could be violence,"" Belafonte said. ""One of the things that I said in my conversations with the Kennedys in discussing why they should be more yielding in their support of our demonstration was the fact that there would be such a presence of highly profiled artists -- that that alone would put anxiety to rest,"" he added. ""People would be looking at the occasion in a far more festive way."" Belafonte continued his acting and singing career, and today, at 86, he is still an activist for human rights causes. At the March on Washington: The anger, fear, love and hope . Rachelle Horowitz . Rachelle Horowitz took a break from her job at the Worker's Defense League in 1963 to be in charge of March on Washington transportation -- despite the fact she couldn't even drive. ""And I was totally horrified and frightened about this notion,"" she said. ""And I said something that also in retrospect seems fairly silly. 'How can I be the transportation director? I can't drive,' which I couldn't. I was a New Yorker. And also I had lost my bus on every previous march."" But with the encouragement of her mentor and future lifelong colleague, march organizer Bayard Rustin, Horowitz proceeded to organize all the buses, trains and planes for the more than 200,000 people who attended the march that day. In a time long before e-mail and Facebook, this was no easy task. Horowitz used a system of 5x3 index cards and massive lists attached to the office walls to keep track of all the various travel options. After her months of tedious work came to fruition with a well-attended and successful march, Horowitz reveled in the moment at the end of the day. ""All of us who had worked on the march,"" continued Horowitz, ""were just incredibly happy and pleased with what had happened. And we all linked hands and sang 'We Shall Overcome.' "" Horowitz went on to be Rustin's assistant and eventually served as the political director for the American Federation of Teachers.","Wednesday marks 50 years since the March on Washington .

"(CNN) -- Soldiers dropped huge sandbags from army helicopters Tuesday as part of efforts to stem devastating flooding in northern Germany after the swollen Elbe River breached flood defenses. A sea of muddy brown water has flowed through two broken dikes in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people from their homes. The situation is stabilizing in the flooded village of Fischbeck, near the town of Stendal, which was left largely submerged after a dike there broke Sunday, officials said. The flow of water pouring through a gaping breach nearly 50 meters (160 feet) across is now slowing, and water levels have dropped slightly across the state, Saxony-Anhalt Interior Minister Holger Stahlknecht said Tuesday. An electricity substation was threatened in nearby Sandau, but the situation has now been stabilized, the flood crisis team at the Interior Ministry in Saxony-Anhalt said. A dike on the Elbe at Schoenebeck, south of Magdeburg, is secure, but a protective evacuation of homes has been carried out, it said. The water level around Stendal has dropped about half a meter (20 inches) since its peak Monday morning, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, and should drop another 20 inches in the next 24 to 48 hours. The peak surpassed 8.2 meters (26.9 feet), breaking the 2002 record of 7.68 meters (25.2 feet). Police shut down the center of Wittenberg on Tuesday, a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited to meet volunteers and see flood prevention efforts for herself. The crest is occurring around Wittenberg and the water should continue to rise farther to the west around Boizenburg and Hamburg in the coming days, Miller said. About 4,000 German soldiers have been deployed in Saxony-Anhalt, with some dispatched to drop the huge bags of sand from the air. Three people died in the state last week in connection with the flooding. Another five deaths have been reported across the country. Volunteer patrols . Dikes are holding so far in Lower Saxony, northwest of Saxony-Anhalt, as the water level on the Elbe reaches 8 meters (26 feet,) state Interior Ministry spokesman Philipp Wedelich said. About 8,000 volunteers are patrolling the dikes and aiding flood prevention efforts, he said. The critical areas are Lueneburg and Luechow-Dannenberg, he said. No deaths have been reported in Lower Saxony. The surging Elbe River, which last week brought flooding to the state of Saxony, to the south, is making its way northwest toward the North Sea. The town of Lauenburg, in Schleswig-Holstein, has been evacuated as a precaution as the river is expected to peak there by Thursday as it nears the sea, the European Commission's emergency response center said. In Saxony, the water levels are falling but 12,000 people are still unable to return to their homes, the state's Interior Ministry said. Work is still being done to strengthen dikes because they could weaken if the waters recede slowly, it said. The mighty Danube . Over the past 10 days, floods on the Elbe and other rivers including the Danube have also affected southern Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. They are the worst since flooding in 2002 devastated the region. The Czech Republic is now focused on draining the flood waters and cleanup efforts, Czech fire service spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova said. Eleven people have died nationwide as a result of the floods, she said. Heavy rain Monday complicated the recovery efforts and caused more flash flooding, she added. In Austria, river levels are dropping, but the mighty Danube, normally an important transit route for freight and passengers, is still closed to river traffic, the European Commission's emergency response center said. The crest on the Danube reached a record high in Hungary's capital, Budapest, late Sunday, but the city's flood defenses held and levels there are now dropping. The river is expected to peak Tuesday in Paks in central Hungary, and a day later in Baja in southern Hungary. Flood precautions are now under way in Serbia as the Danube starts to rise there, with some evacuations already taking place. The region's rivers were filled to bursting by torrential rain at the start of the month, after a wet spring left the ground saturated. CNN's Rick Noack and Ivana Kottasova contributed to this report.","NEW: The crest on the River Elbe is moving northwest through Germany, now near Wittenberg .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of demonstrators in eastern Baghdad marked the eighth anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime with a protest Saturday against the American troop presence there. The demonstrators, followers of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, rallied in Mustansriya Square, where they called all U.S troops to withdraw from Iraq at the end of the year. The protesters carried Iraqi flag and banners, with some chanting ""Baghdad is a free country, America get out!"" and ""No for Occupation, No for America."" One banner read ""No, no America,"" while another said, "" Yes, yes for Quran."" American troops are scheduled to depart from Iraq at year's end under a bilateral agreement between the Iraqi government and the United States. But if violence increases and instability persists in Iraq, it is possible both countries could agree to keep some U.S. troops in Iraq, which now has about 47,000 American soldiers. The figure is down from a high of 171,000 in 2003. That prospect of American troops staying in Iraq disturbs many citizens, including the thousands who support al-Sadr, a cleric with grassroots appeal in Iraq's Shiite cities and neighborhoods. Sheikh Salah al-Obaidi, a cleric who read a statement to demonstrators on behalf of al-Sadr, raised the prospect of American troops staying in Iraq into next year and beyond. ""What if the invading forces decide not to leave our country? What if they decide to stay? What if American troops and others decide to stay in our lands? .... Will you keep silent? "" al-Obaidi said, reading al-Sadr's statement to chants of ""God is great."" ""If they decide to stay in our country, then we have to do two things: first is to escalate armed resistance and lift the freeze on Mehdi Army,"" al-Obaidi said. He was referring to the August 2007 suspension of the activities of the Mehdi Army, al-Sadr's militia. U.S. military commanders have cited that move as a major reason for a decline in violence across Iraq, where Al-Sadr's forces fought American troops during the height of the war. Emotions on the street were fueled by the remarks of U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who made an unannounced visit this week to Iraq and discussed American troop presence with top officials, including Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. ""My message to them was if there is to be a presence or they still need help, we are open to that possibility. But they have to ask, and time is running out in Washington because we have a lot going on around the world and we've got to make some decisions,"" Gates said. ""It obviously would be a presence that's a fraction of the size of the one we have here now but it's really up to the Iraqis at this point."" On Friday, street protesters in Baghdad and other provinces also focused on the fall of the Hussein regime and grievances stemming from war, including an opposition to the U.S. troop presence. That was a change of theme in recent weeks when demonstrators in Iraq have rallied over the same bread-and-butter issues that have prompted street protests across the Arab world. People have been upset over corruption, unemployment, the lack of basic services and restrictions on freedom of expression. Protesters in the Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya called for the release of detainees and compensation for ""the victims of the occupation."" ""Some of the protesters shouted, 'No to occupation, no to foreign troops,'"" witnesses said. In Baghdad's Tahrir Square, nearly 300 protesters carrying banners and Iraqi flags, shouted, ""We will not accept life in an occupied country anymore."" One of the banners read, ""No to American and Iranian occupation!"" That includes a reference to Iran's influence with the Shiite masses and the Iraqi government. Women carried pictures of their sons and husbands who are missing or were killed during the war. ""During this war, so many women lost sons and many others became widows, not only Iraqi women but also American women. We are the ones who paid the price of this war,"" said Shima Kareem, who was among the protesters. Hundreds also turned out in Falluja, in the largely Sunni Anbar province in the west and in Samarra, in Salaheddin province in the north to demand the release of detainees, compensation for victims' families, and the departure of American troops. Since 2003, 4,421 U.S. troops have died in Iraq, according to the military figures counted by CNN. A U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 led to the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime on April 9. The iconic toppling of the former ruler's statue in Baghdad's Firdous Square symbolizes the regime's fall.","Protesters want U.S. troops out .

"(CNN) -- Under the guise of making check-in as seamless a process as possible, airlines have strived to put as much in the hands of the passenger as possible. The baggage-drop has been the one sticky area that continues to demand a level of interaction with staff. That is slated to become a thing of the past, however, as more carriers opt to handover that responsibility to flyers. Last month, Iberia launched MyBagTag, a system of print-at-home luggage tags aimed at shaving minutes off the check-in process. Iberia is the first European carrier to introduce such a process. ""It's like the fast track at McDonald's,"" says Dimitris Bountolos, Iberia's customer experience director. ""Everything is more or less organized by the customer. They manage themselves, and it allows us to manage them faster."" Passengers weigh their bags at home, fill in the weight and measurements online, then print out the tags on an A4 piece of paper, which they fold in fourths and stick in a reusable plastic sheaths (available for free at any Spanish airport). The extra effort at home pays off, says Bountolos. ""Traditionally, we get congested during the summer season. Customers can wait ten to 15 minutes to check in their bags,"" he explains. ""We've brought that down to 30 seconds per customer."" Go inside an Airbus A380 on Google Street View . A handful of other airlines have been experimenting with self-bag tag over the last year. Alaska Airlines, American and Air Canada are a few of the carriers that have started to set up bag tag kiosks throughout a handful of airports. More are expected to embrace the concept in the next few years. ""It's a trend we'll see broadly across the industry over the next ten to 20 years,"" says Hunter Keay, a senior airline analyst at Wolfe Research. ""It certainly reduced the bottleneck at check-in, though ultimately it's about reducing costs for the airlines,"" he says. A savings, he adds, that could ultimately be passed on to customers. Infographic: Which airlines have on board wi-fi? British Airways, meanwhile, has taken a more technical approach, and is planning to introduce reusable electronic baggage tags by January 2015. The tags, in Kindle fashion, use e-ink, and customers upload their travel itinerary by checking-in using British Airways' smartphone app and holding their phones over the tag. Once at the airport, they can then drop-off their bags and go. ""It's not just about saving time, but giving customers choice,"" says Finola O'Sullivan, Birtish Airways' customer service delivery manager. Though she estimates the times savings are little more than a minute, it's the psychology of the thing that flyers value. ""When they're doing things themselves, it feels like time passes quicker than when they're standing around waiting for somebody,"" she says.","Iberia is first European airline to allow passengers to print own luggage tags .
Process could be seen as time-saving for customers and cost-saving for airlines .
British Airways and U.S. airlines also experimenting with self tagged bags ."

"London (CNN) -- A new window on your life may soon be opened from space -- in high quality video and in almost real-time. The resolution might not be clear enough to pick out individual faces but if the simulation footage proves accurate then a video camera soon to be attached to the International Space Station (ISS) will be able to show high definition movies capable of detailing your car moving on the highway. UrtheCast, the company behind the idea, aims to stream the video for free over the web and make the data open source so you can integrate it into your own applications. ""To track and see people moving from space is 100% unique,"" said UrtheCast president Scott Larson. He explained that their images will have more pixels than most computer screens so the streaming footage will appear somewhat ""downgraded."" But he said those who choose to pay for a subscription will have access to higher quality raw imagery from which they can glean detailed information. UrtheCast says the video will be available between 30 minutes and two hours after shooting and the high quality footage will have a resolution down to a meter. Google currently provides similar quality still images for some parts of the world which are made up from satellite pictures and aerial photography. It declined to comment on the resolution but points out that it upgraded its service in June. The American space agency NASA provides real-time video from the space station, except when it's out of communication. NASA spokesman Joshua Byerly says the footage is typically of the ISS laboratories in the day, and outside the station in standard definition when the crew goes to sleep. Larson said the UrtheCast imagery will be useful for monitoring crop growth and disease, water resources and the rate and scale of deforestation. The company website also shows how the data could be used to help in the wake of disasters by, for example, showing emergency response teams the safest, fastest access routes. ""Developers will think of far more creative applications than we'd ever be able to, which is essentially the Internet model ... let the developers and users drive its effectiveness,"" said Larson. Scientists from Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in England built two cameras for UrtheCast (one medium resolution and one high resolution) at a cost of several million dollars. They are due to be launched on a Russian spacecraft from Baikonur Cosmodrome in November, and the team hopes to see them in action in 2014. Ian Tosh, the ISS camera project manager at RAL, told CNN: ""The key thing about this video camera is that it's on a platform outside the space station which can point on two axes so when the space station comes over the horizon you can point the camera to a target on the ground and track it for two to three minutes -- that's never been done before. ""You may think the military are doing this all the time -- that they can read number plates and newsprint -- but that's not the reality. You can't see faces; you wouldn't be able to recognize someone lying naked in the back garden, so we're not going down the route of blanking out faces because you can't see them. ""What you will definitely see is cars going down the motorway. You'll still be able to see lines on runways and crowds of people."" Space expert Stuart Eves, who worked on the Earth observation satellite ""TopSat,"" said he admired the ambition of the project but highlighted some limitations. He pointed out that ISS has ""an orbit repeat cycle of three days, and doesn't get back to the same lighting conditions for more than 60 days. ""The video element is really for entertainment value -- it's nice to watch,"" he said. But he added that delays in getting the imagery back means that you can't use it for practical real-time applications like vehicles moving along a motorway, and underlined that the space station is only over a specific target for less than 10 minutes as it moves overhead. The issue of privacy may worry some -- knowing that they can be filmed from space -- but Larson argues that many of us are already closely monitored by CCTV and can be tracked by the signals from our cell phones. ""It's less invasive than that,"" he said, adding that there will be some restrictions on the imagery that can be released to the public. According to Ian Tosh, the Russians won't allow data of their territories to be released. Producing a camera that can survive the rigors of space is technically challenging. The lenses have to be made with fine precision, able to survive the degradation caused by radiation in space, the vibration at launch and keep their shape despite the extreme ranges of temperature in orbit. ""Polishing [lenses] hasn't changed much since Galileo -- it's still a grinding process,"" said Tosh. ""The optical surface has to be good to 60 billionths of a meter deviation from the ideal surface. We've got to have a thermal system that can keep the temperature uniform in the telescope and within certain bounds so that we can stay in focus."" If the mission can overcome the technical hurdles and survive the hazards of launch, UrtheCast says its cameras will capture an area of the globe so large that it contains the majority of the world's population.","Footage from cameras due to be fitted to the space station will be streamed on the Internet .
UrtheCast says the video data could be used to help in the wake of disasters .

"(CNN) -- A 35-year-old father found to be sane when he killed his three young daughters last July was sentenced to three life sentences without the possibility of parole Monday. St. Croix County Judge Howard Cameron said the lives of sisters Amara,11, Sophie, 8, and Cecilia, 5, were each so important that Aaron Schaffhausen had to serve each sentence consecutively. ""Each child has to be recognized as an individual girl,"" Cameron said. ""To make it concurrent would diminish what happened to those young girls."" Schaffhausen and his wife Jessica had recently divorced when he came to spend the day with his daughters last year. According to the criminal complaint, Jessica -- who was not home at the time -- told police that two hours after Schaffhausen went to see the girls, he called her and said, ""You can come home now because I killed the kids."" Jessica, who was in court Monday, was quiet throughout the proceedings. But her sister, Mary Elizabeth Stotz, called Schaffhausen an ""evil coward"" who ""should rot in hell"" during the victim impact statements. ""Aaron Schaffhausen, the man who helped genetically make those girls and shape them ... Aaron became the darkness, the boogeyman, and the monster under the bed,"" Stotz said. ""He was so evil that he took their unconditional love for him and used their love to lure them close enough so he could kill them. Their last memory is what an evil killer their dad was."" Stotz also expressed fear that if Schaffhausen was allowed to be released on parole, he would get revenge on her family. Schaffhausen sat through the proceedings with no visible emotion, avoiding eye contact and almost inaudibly saying ""no"" when the judge asked him if he had anything to say. His attorney, John Kucinski, emphasized that his client suffered from a ""rare mental illness"" who committed a ""rare catathymic homicide."" ""Nobody wins in this case,"" Kucinski said. ""Both families suffer, Jessica suffers, uncles, aunts. ""You can say, 'Three young girls are dead, we've lost their lives, he did it because he hated Jessica, let's get our revenge.' Or you can try to actually take a look at mental illness and prevent things in the future,"" Kucinski said. A large photograph of the sisters stood by the judge, who finished his sentencing by saying, ""People in general, there is sometimes an evil, and there is goodness,"" Cameron said. The girls' aunt remembered them as ""amazing people.""","Aaron Schaffhausen killed his three daughters, ages 5 to 11, last year .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Blair Brettschneider didn't experience war or genocide as a young girl in suburban Michigan. She has never received a death threat, and she has never seen a family member murdered. But the 49 teenagers she helps every week have. Brettschneider, 24, runs GirlForward, a nonprofit that provides support to young female refugees who have been resettled in the Chicago area. ""Mostly, they are just normal teenage girls. We talk about celebrities and movies and books,"" Brettschneider said. ""But then at the same time, a lot of them have lost parents who've been killed. They've seen bombs in their city. They've lost people to disease and grown up in really dire conditions."" And when they arrive in America, often from war-torn places such as Iraq, Ivory Coast and Myanmar, they face major challenges in building their new lives. ""It's hard enough to be a teenage girl in the United States. ... It's even harder to be a refugee teenage girl,"" Brettschneider said. ""Girls are, along with the rest of their family, learning the language, adjusting to a new culture, trying to get used to school. At the same time, they are usually in charge of taking care of their siblings or grandparents. They have to translate all the mail that comes, any bills, help go to doctors' appointments."" GirlForward mentors these young refugees to help them adapt to their new surroundings, and it teaches them the skills they need to become successful, independent young women and productive members of society. All of the girls in the program are in the country legally, Brettschneider said. Most arrived with their families through the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a government agency that offers assistance to refugees of special humanitarian concern. Many of the families have fled religious or ethnic persecution, sometimes even torture. Brettschneider first saw how hard it is for young teenage refugees when she worked with Domi, a girl who came to the United States at 16. Because of war, Domi and her family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo when she was 3. She lived in a Tanzanian refugee camp along with her six siblings and her mother until they moved to America. But when Domi arrived, she didn't know the language, and she struggled to adjust to her new surroundings. ""It was so cold. I didn't have a jacket,"" said Domi, now 20 and attending college. ""I didn't speak English. I couldn't talk to other friends. ... I was sad, angry, freaked out."" Domi desperately needed extra help in school, as well, and that's when she met Brettschneider, who was volunteering as a tutor with an organization called RefugeeOne. Brettschneider had been interested in helping refugees since she'd been involved with the Save Darfur movement in high school, and she started working with the group after college. But because of Domi's domestic responsibilities, it was hard to meet consistently. ""She always got there really late and had to leave early to go home and cook dinner and take care of her younger siblings,"" Brettschneider said. ""So I asked if I could start tutoring her at home."" Brettschneider began making house calls to help Domi, even using her own money to take her out for fun. ""We went to the Museum of Science and Industry, the Shedd Aquarium; she asked me if people eat the fish, which I will always remember,"" Brettschneider said. ""Early on, she really hadn't been to many restaurants, and she was really nervous about it. ... We also went to the movies and to see (the musical) 'Hair' when it came to Chicago."" As they spent more time together, Brettschneider realized that Domi had dreams and passions but no idea how to make them a reality. ""Domi wanted to be a nurse, but (she) didn't know what that meant or how to get there,"" Brettschneider said. ""There's just so much that you grow up with in the United States that you don't even think about having to learn, like, 'What is college? What is a community college? What is financial aid?' "" Brettschneider realized there were so many other girls like Domi. So in 2011, she used a $2,000 gift from her grandparents to launch a support group for refugee teens. She started with about 10 people, and the group quickly grew into what GirlForward is today. The nonprofit offers educational programs and job training to the girls, as well as a summer camp with field trips and fun activities. Brettschneider often brings in guest speakers, such as nurses and financial advisers, who can bring practical knowledge to the girls. ""We had people from a bank come and talk to girls about financial literacy,"" Brettschneider said. ""This was informal, like what savings is and why it's important."" It's programs like these, as well as Brettschneider's hands-on touch, that make her group appealing for families, many of whom are unaccustomed to promoting girls' education and independence. She even visits families at home to discuss the details of the group in person. ""In the beginning, sometimes families are skeptical of what we're doing,"" Brettschneider said. ""But we've seen parents really come on board and like that the girls are coming here, because they learn important things about safety and they make friends."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . One of Brettschneider's early initiatives was to provide each girl with her own mentor to work with their individual needs. By October, she will have 20 pairs. These one-on-one relationships can be a valuable source of information and emotional support. ""My mentor and I go to new places to learn about new cultures,"" said 15-year-old Sara, whose family fled Iraq. ""She also helps me learn about transportation. We go do fun activities, but she also helps me when I have school projects."" Sara said meeting the other girls has been incredibly helpful, too, because of the common bond they share. ""We talk about new movies, shopping, stuff like that,"" she said. ""But we also talk about some of the stuff we go through here every day, how we miss our home and what we would like to be in the future."" The group's headquarters -- a cozy and colorful office space -- has become a place the girls can call home. ""They often are sharing bedrooms with grandparents, younger siblings,"" Brettschneider said. ""And this is a place where you can come and relax and read a book or use the computer and, you know, be around girls your own age."" Brettschneider said it's inspiring to watch the girls learn and grow. Ultimately, she wants to help them enjoy their new lives and fulfill all of their dreams. ""It is really important that the girls be able to go to college, but that's not just the one goal,"" she said. ""It's also about making friends and learning how to adjust to a new city and doing all these other things. ""What I see is what all of the girls can accomplish and everything that they can do -- and that's really why all of this exists."" Want to get involved?

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, the former enlisted man who earned his sergeant stripes as a grunt in the jungles of Vietnam, is cutting the budgets of the Pentagon's top brass by 20%. And he's sharing the pain, cutting his own office budget by a like amount. ""Early estimates indicate that the total savings could be in the range of $1.5-$2 billion,"" Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement released Tuesday night. Much of the money savings will come from a cut in the number of people working for the Department of Defense leaders, but there's no word yet on how many people might lose their positions. ""Personnel reductions associated with these savings will be determined during the development of detailed execution plans,"" Little said. The plan goes into effect in October 2014 and will last until 2019. Budget cutting has been a main priority at the Defense Department for several years, even before Hagel took over. The Pentagon said this is not one of the budget issues that can be reversed when sequestration goes away. ""These cuts will be implemented even if Congress lifts sequester-level budget caps,"" Little said.","Hagel wants to tighten spending at Pentagon .

"(CNN) -- For those that live and work in the Middle East, Ramadan is a period of considerable downtime. In many countries, special laws require the working day is reduced to accommodate those fasting (observers are meant to abstain from food, water, cigarettes -- even gossip -- during the daylight hours of the month-long holiday). As a result, TV consumption goes up, and with it, TV advertising budgets. ""It's like the Super Bowl and Christmas combined, only instead of one week or ten days, it lasts all month,"" explains Khaled Gadallah, the managing partner at Dubai-based advertising firm Tonic International. While many countries in the region lack metrics to measure the ratings, there are several indicators that viewership spikes dramatically. An audience measurement system called Tview was introduced in the UAE last year prior to Ramadan, and found that Emirati viewers watched TV for an average of six hours and nine minutes a day during the first ten days, 32 minutes more than during the first six months. ""Average viewership is a couple of hours during normal days. On Ramadan, it is double that, because people have more downtime; more me- and we- time,"" says Vatche Keverian, the CEO of J. Walter Thompson's Middle East headquarters (JWT MENA). Read more: Innovation gets a kick-start . As a result, it is not uncommon for companies in the region to spend a third or more of their advertising budget over Ramadan, according to the Pan Arab Research Center (PARC). If advertisers can hitch themselves to the right program, the benefits can extend well beyond the season. ""Past trends indicate that television media that performs well during Ramadan carry their ratings earned for months to come,"" explains M Shaharyar Umar, PARC's marketing director. Coca Cola and Pepsi are among the biggest spenders in the Middle East during the month, with telecommunication companies often bringing up the rear. In 2012, Pepsi spent $91 million on Pan-Arabic television spots, Coke $40 million, and telephone companies like Vodafone and Etisalat spent between $40 and $50 million each. A good portion of Ramadan commercials are rife with clichÃ©s, says Gadallah. ""You can expect to see a lot of star-studded skies, night time, lanterns, and some sort of Islamic motif in the background,"" he says. Traditionally, he adds, breaking the mold can prove challenging. ""What stops a lot of agencies from pushing the envelope is this fear of offending people with a new idea."" Watch: Backstage at Iraq's hottest TV show . In 2006, Gadallah decided to try something different with Nando's, an international fast food chain that wanted to gain more traction with Arab youth. They decided to take a humorous approach to the ritual of fasting, and depicted a man hovering over a Nando's drumstick, waiting anxiously for the sun to set before taking his first bite. ""The beauty of it was that we showed Muslims have a good sense of humor and enjoy having a good laugh. We didn't rely on a local idea that only people from the region would understand,"" he explains. Though it's been several years since the Nando's ad first launched, it remains the most viewed ad during the Ramadan season, thanks to its internet presence. ""The PR Nando's gained from the ad was great. It was not geographically limited to the Middle East, but went across the globe."" It is not uncommon for an exceptional ad to take on a cult status during this time of year. JWT MENA accomplished a similar feat last year with a series of commercials for Vodafone Egypt featuring the country's most famous soap actors. Despite the advert's kitsch-value, Keverian notes that the themes, which revolve around values and the spirit of giving, rarely change. ""The idea is always caring and sharing. You can show that in the expected way -- using traditional families, moons and smiles -- or you can do it in the unexpected way,"" he adds. Last year, JWT MENA created some community service spots for Zain's, a telecommunication company. The commercials addressed issues like litter clean-up and respectful line formation. Far from saccharine, however, they depicted people losing their patience and entertaining The Incredible Hulk-like fantasies before reigning in their temper and engaging in the forgiving spirit of Ramadan. ""One of the things that's so peculiar about Ramadan is that all Muslim countries live the same routine of life for a month; they go back to the traditional values of their culture -- I would say that's what's at the heart of it,"" notes Keverian. In spite of the holiday's unifying properties, Gadallah notes that regional differences shape the types of ads that run. ""In the Gulf region, you still don't really have the freedom to explore new ideas when it comes to Ramadan because it's still a bit more conservative. In cultures such as Egypt, where the season is a lot more festive, you find a lot more engaging content than anywhere else in the world,"" he says.","Islamic holiday of Ramadan seen as opportunity by advertisers .

"New York (CNN) -- The family of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson can't help but count the days since he vanished during a business trip to Iran's Kish Island on March 8, 2007. Saturday marked 2,024 days since he's been gone. ""Every day I miss him,"" said Christine Levinson, his wife of 38 years. ""I wake up and his side of the bed is empty."" She left her Florida home this week to travel to New York in hopes of making a personal plea to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is attending this week's U.N. General Assembly. Levinson is convinced Ahmadinejad can help in the search for her husband. ""In the past he has said that he will investigate and he will have his people investigate,"" Levinson told CNN. ""He has promised to help us. So we need to get him in touch with whoever can help us get the job done and get Bob home."" Feds still hunting for missing FBI agent who vanished in Iran . The Levinson family says Robert was working as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling in Iran when he went missing. The State Department has repeatedly denied he was working for the government and has urged Tehran to find him. Last year, the Iranian government said it would make inquiries about Levinson but did not know what happened to him. Digital billboards were posted in Times Square this week with Levinson's picture and a message to U.N. delegates asking for help in finding him. ""Because the U.N. General Assembly is here, we can get the world to help us,"" Christine Levinson said. The FBI has offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his safe return. His wife has also met with President Obama. ""He said that he would help any way that he could,"" and that ""he would put the full force of the U.S. government behind helping to get Bob home,"" she said. It's believed Levinson, now 64, is being held captive. U.S. officials believe he is somewhere in southwest Asia. It's unclear who is holding him. ""There is every reason to believe based on all the evidence that Levinson is alive and well,"" a source with knowledge of the case said. The source would not provide further details. In a so-called ""proof of life"" video released last year but apparently made two years ago, Levinson appears about 50 to 60 pounds lighter. He stares and blinks as he looks into a camera and says he ""is not in very good health."" He refers to 33 years of service to the U.S. government and asks the United States to ""answer the requests of the group"" that has been holding him. Who the group is and what they want is unknown. ""Please help me get home,"" Levinson says on the tape. Christine has sent several emails to the address where the proof-of-life video came from to ask the senders what they want. ""They have not responded. We have not heard back from them since then and that was almost two years ago. So it's very difficult,"" she said. Levinson said she sees her husband's determination every time she looks at that video. ""It gives me hope that I'll see him again soon. And comfort that I can at least say to the picture, 'I love you.'"" The Levinsons have seven children and two grandchildren. One daughter was married last year. Her brother stood in for their father and walked her down the aisle. Levinson has also missed a son and daughter's high school and college graduations. ""They both wore yellow ribbons and carried pictures of Bob to the graduations just to keep him in our prayers,"" Christine Levinson said. She said she hopes to deliver this message to Iran's leader: ""Please help my family to become whole again. We need Bob home as soon as possible.""

"(CNN) -- Climbing the world's highest mountain is challenge enough, but for Raha Moharrak, it also meant breaking a taboo. The 27-year-old graphic designer is from Saudi Arabia, an ultra-orthodox country which only officially allowed sport to be played in private girls' schools in May. But Moharrak, who had been raised by her parents to aim for greatness, wanted to test her limits and that also meant challenging her culture. Mountaineering seemed like the perfect pursuit but getting her father, who still maintained conservative views, to agree was going to be the first hurdle. ""I told him the idea and he was like 'you want to do what? Ah very interesting. Why don't you leave it until you get married?'"" Moharrak recalls. Fuming and determined not to give up on her dream, Moharrak then wrote her father a long email arguing her point and then waited for three agonizing days for his response. ""I was so scared of his reaction,"" she says. ""And after the three days of silence to me he sent me one line -- 'I love you. You are crazy. Go for it.'"" Since then, Moharrak's family has supported her every step of the way. She began climbing in November 2011 and in the space of a year, conquered eight mountains including Kilimanjaro. Everest, by the numbers . Then on May 18 this year, she stepped into the history books by becoming the first Saudi woman to climb to the summit of Mount Everest. She was also the youngest Saudi to reach the top of the world and was part of the first Arab team to make the climb. ""When I finally got there I was thinking 75% of people die on the way down, so I was thinking celebrate but not too much because you still have to get down."" Moharrak had trained hard for the expedition and promised herself that if she was at risk of losing fingers and toes to frostbite, she would abandon her attempt. Many doubted she would make it. ""One person actually said 'What is Barbie doing on the mountain?' and I said: 'Don't let the Disney princess hair fool you.'"" Raha Moharrak's triumph on Everest is the latest in a growing number of milestones for women in Saudi Arabia. She follows the path of America-based Sarah Attar who became the first Saudi woman to compete in an Olympics at the London Games last year and Dubai-born Elham al Qasimi who became the first Arab woman to reach the North Pole in 2010. ""I did not set out to be a poster child for anything,"" Raha Moharark she says. ""I saw a mountain. I wanted to climb it."" Moharrak's only hope is that her achievements will help change the perception that Saudi women have of themselves and cites an email she received from a young fan. ""I think she was 13 or 14 years old ... saying 'I just wanted to tell you that after hearing your story I found the courage to ask my father for a bicycle.' I thought if that young lady had the courage to buy a bicycle today and to ride it, what is she capable of tomorrow?"" For Moharrak, the achievement is not being the first Saudi woman to conquer Everest, but to ensure she is not the last.","Raha Moharrak, 27, is the first Saudi woman to conquer Everest .

"LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN)  -- Bolivian police Thursday foiled a plot to assassinate President Evo Morales, the country's vice president and other top government officials, Morales said in Venezuela, where he is attending a summit. Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera, left, and President Evo Morales appear in La Paz earlier this week. The plot involved Irish and Croatian nationals as well as Bolivians, Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera said at a separate news conference in La Paz. When police moved in to arrest the five suspects at a hotel in the eastern Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, they became embroiled in a 30-minute gun battle, Morales said. Three of the gunmen were killed and two were arrested. Officials recovered heavy armaments at a nearby warehouse that authorities said belonged to the gunmen. The five are suspected of involvement in the bombing of Catholic Cardinal Julio Terrazas' house in Santa Cruz a day earlier, Garcia Linera said. No one was injured in that attack. Garcia Linera called the suspects ""a dangerous gang of mercenary terrorists."" Morales said he traveled to the summit of leftist Latin American leaders in Venezuela although he ""had information that there would be an attempt."" Opposition leaders in Santa Cruz were unconvinced a plot existed, saying the government was trying to use the apparent danger to silence critics. The leaders pointed to previous alleged assassination plots based on what they called flimsy evidence. ""These things happen when the president is not in the republic,"" said critic Luis Nunez. ""They're trying to scare those who think differently."" Santa Cruz, an opposition stronghold, is about 340 miles (550 kilometers) east-southeast of La Paz, the Bolivian capital. Morales made the announcement in the seaside city of Cumana, Venezuela. He was flanked by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who had his arm around Morales' shoulders, and Cuban leader Raul Castro.","Assassination plot reportedly against President Evo Morales, other Bolivian officials .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- On North Korea's national airline the sound system blares patriotic music at passengers from the moment they get on the plane until the moment they step off the aircraft. The volume is so loud that earphones fail to drown out the socialist anthems. Even in the tiny bathroom, there is no escape. Next to the sink, a speaker continues to blast occupants with paeans to the people's paradise. The inescapable soundtrack aboard the Air Koryo plane is a fitting metaphor for my recent five-day trip to Pyongyang. It was a tightly-restricted, carefully stage-managed tour rich with propaganda and political theater and little else: It offered virtually no insight into what life is like for ordinary citizens who live in this rigid dictatorship. For a foreign journalist it was like trying to peer through a keyhole -- and being left to guess at the hidden world on the other side of the door. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . The North Korean regime invited more than a dozen television crews from around the world to see its lavish celebration of the 60th anniversary of the signing of the armistice that brought an end to the fighting for the Korean War. In a characteristic burst of revisionist history, Pyongyang refers to this as its ""grand victory against US imperialists in the Fatherland Liberation War."" This was the image the North Korean leadership wanted to present to the outside world: endless parades of goose-stepping soldiers and military hardware, accompanied by huge demonstrations of popular support for Kim Jong Un, the twenty-something leader who inherited the dynastic throne when his father died in 2011. North Korea's Kim Jong Un honors country's war veterans . The relatively inexperienced grandson has a striking -- some say deliberate -- resemblance to his grandfather Kim Il Sung, the long-dead founder of communist North Korea. ""They're trying to connect Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Un,"" said Han Park, a professor of International Relations at the University of Georgia. Park spoke to CNN after the grandson inaugurated an enormous new Korean War museum, dominated by giant portraits and statues of a youthful Kim Il Sung. The sight of the corpulent Kim Jong Un touring the gilded new museum contrasted sharply with appalling statistics recently released by the United Nations. Last month, the U.N.'s World Food Program called for donated foreign food aid to be distributed to 2.4 million North Korean women and children for ""the prevention and cure of moderate acute malnutrition among children (6 months -- 4 years old) and their mothers."" Those 2.4 million people amount to roughly 10% of the Korean population. Up to a million North Koreans are believed to have died in a famine when this country's state-controlled economy all but collapsed in the 1990s. The visit to Pyongyang marked the most strictly controlled foreign assignment of my journalistic career. North Korea was more restrictive than previous reporting trips to Iran and even Moammar Gadhafi's Libya at a time when his regime was trying -- and ultimately failing -- to survive a NATO bombing campaign. We were not allowed to leave the confines of the Yanggakdo International Hotel unless we were riding a government bus. During my five days in North Korea, the authorities did not even allow me to see what the country's currency looks like. Cosmetic change, but no real reform, in North Korea . Two unfailingly polite government minders -- one junior, one senior -- were assigned to remain at the side of our three-man television crew at all times. Aside from arrival and departure from the airport, I estimate our buses remained within a roughly five square-mile perimeter in the center of Pyongyang for five days. This bubble of cityscape consisted of gleaming monuments to the Kim dynasty, Soviet-style apartment buildings, tidy streets largely empty of vehicular traffic and manicured lawns. On several occasions, I saw kneeling North Korean laborers trimming the lawns by hand. At night, the city was eerily dark. Electricity appeared to be in short supply. On the pitch-black night-time drive from the airport to the hotel, our bus briefly illuminated pedestrians walking in the darkness on the shoulder of the highway. They didn't even have flashlights. The authorities made no pretense of allowing us to film freely. The elder of the two government guides routinely instructed us to stop taking pictures. At one point, when I asked why I couldn't shoot photos of pedestrians from the window of our moving bus, our senior minder told me: ""We don't want journalists spreading vicious propaganda about our country."" ""When you search on the internet, it is full of photos of North Koreans wearing rags,"" our senior minder explained, revealing that he was one of the elite few allowed access to what was said about North Korea in the outside world. The North Korea we rarely see . For five days we were taken to a series of government ceremonies: the opening of a new veterans' cemetery, the mass Arirang Games -- a truly mind-boggling performance boasting a choreographed cast of thousands -- and the most surreal event of all: the Kimjongilia and Kimilsungia Flower Festival. The celebration focused on a red blossom and a purple orchid which were named after the two former rulers of the country. Organizers had erected floral pavilions, interlacing flowers with images of the two leaders and pictures of missiles, tanks, and other North Korean war machines. ""When you look at these flowers we feel great yearning for our leaders,"" said Ri Su Jong, a 21-year old woman who worked as an official guide at the festival. She said there were more than 20,000 flowerpots at the exhibit. When I asked her which flower she preferred, Ri immediately answered: ""I love both."" Sadly, I believe I failed to have a sincere, open conversation with a single North Korean during my time there. The discipline and control exhibited by the government in Pyongyang was almost complete. It was a sharp contrast to my experience in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, when foreign visitors had easy access to black market traders greedy for Western cigarettes, chewing gum and blue jeans outside government hotels. In Pyongyang, interviews with veterans and parade-goers quickly turned into fervid denunciations of U.S. imperialism, before we were whisked away by our minders. Veteran POWs recall misery of North Korean captivity . I did learn from a group of schoolchildren, who had been brought to bow before the final resting place of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, that they liked swimming in the ocean and roller-blading. But when I asked a 12-year old boy about his favorite TV shows, he answered: ""Cartoons and documentaries about Kim Il Sung."" It is possible that all of the school children in North Korea love and adore the founding father of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But one exchange with our junior minder suggested that some North Koreans had an appetite for more than biographies about their leaders. ""Which movie stars do you like?"" the 21-year old asked me over a tasty Korean lunch of locally-brewed beer and cold buckwheat noodles. Our junior minder liked Brad Pitt. He went on to tell me that he had been allowed to watch several Hollywood movies in his university English class. With the exception of the thriller ""Se7en"" and the comedy ""Big Daddy,"" they were mostly historical period pieces: ""Troy,"" ""Gladiator,"" and ""The Sound of Music."" He asked: ""Do you know the song 'Eidelweiss'?"" The young minder was at his happiest when he borrowed my iPhone. Some North Koreans now have access to cell phones. But the government prohibits ordinary North Koreans from using Internet, e-mail or even making international telephone calls. However, he knew how to navigate my cell phone and quickly immersed himself in several iPhone games. ""Do you have Bluetooth?"" he asked, since I could not e-mail him a photo I had taken of him. In Pyongyang, the government mask briefly slipped on the day of the military parade celebrating the war's anniversary. It was scorching hot and humid in the North Korean capital on July 27. Octogenarian veterans wearing uniforms bristling with shiny medals packed bleachers overlooking the parade grounds. They waited for hours under the hot sun until Kim Jong Un made his appearance in a shaded grandstand overlooking the square named after his grandfather. Soldiers and citizens then spent the next several hours, goose-stepping and cheering in the summer heat to the music of a military marching band. Finally, sometime around noon, the Respected Leader waved goodbye. The moment he left, both parade participants and spectators crumpled to the ground. Many were clearly victims of heat stroke and exhaustion. I saw a soldier, wearing the full dress uniform of his marching band, nearly unconscious in the tiny spot of shade made by his stand of cymbals. An elderly veteran sat gasping on the sidewalk in another spot of shade, visibly distraught. CNN's cameraman David Hawley ran to a civilian woman who lay heaving on a curb, handing her our last bottle of water. She took the bottle as two of her friends helped carry her away. There was no other apparent source of water or hydration for the masses of people who had been performing in the square. The organizers of this spectacle of North Korean military might did not appear to have taken into account the inevitable dehydration of their citizens. That night, the government summoned foreign dignitaries and its most elite supporters for yet another show of patriotism. After making the crowd wait for hours, Kim Jong Un occupied a throne at one end of a park next to his guest of honor, the vice president of China. They watched as a spectacular fireworks display erupted above the newly-inaugurated ""Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum."" I looked at the crowd of North Koreans. In nearly every row, it seemed there was at least one exhausted spectator fast asleep, oblivious to the victory fireworks exploding in front of their faces.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian security forces stormed two sit-ins orchestrated by supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy early Wednesday, bulldozing tents and escorting away hundreds of protesters, CNN correspondents say. At a makeshift hospital, CNN's Reza Sayah described walking through the blood of the injured. ""We have witnessed scores of injured brought on stretchers before us. Many of them were in bad shape. It looked like many of them had been shot,"" he said. ""I have personally never seen this much bloodshed in what, according to what we've seen over the past six weeks, had been a peaceful demonstration."" Egypt's interim government and Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood are reporting scores of people have been killed in what's being dubbed the country's bloodiest day since the 2011 revolution. CNN correspondents described bloody scenes as security forces clash with Morsy supporters. ""I think what we're seeing right now is just the beginning of what is promising to be a very, very long and bloody battle as the interim government and the security forces try to regain control of the streets,"" CNN's Arwa Damon reported. The Egypt raid: At a glance . Arriving earlier at one of the entrances to the Rabaa al-Adawiya Square encampment, Sayah said the scene resembled ""a war zone."" Thick plumes of black smoke were rising through the air from where it was understood security forces had entered the area and pro-Morsy supporters were facing off against those forces, he said. Protesters were breaking bricks and gunfire could be heard, while tear gas was filling the air. ""Up above there are military helicopters and this is just an all-out fight and I think this is what a lot of people were concerned about -- this kind of violent scene,"" he said. ""There's heavy tear gas being used. A lot of people are emotional, we've seen women cry, we've seen people appear to lose consciousness because of the tear gas and now we just wait to see what happens. ""This is going to be an incredibly difficult demonstration to clear out. Not like (the Nahda camp) that was cleared out earlier today by security forces -- this is a much larger sit-in."" As Sayah spoke to CNN, he described protesters barricading the street where his television crew had arrived and where fighting had broken out. It was unclear whether the clash had involved security forces or residents opposed to the sit-in, he said. ""That's not unusual for residents who are against the Muslim Brotherhood -- against the former president -- to get in on these fights."" The protesters appeared to be surrounded on all sides, he said. ""This is the most intense gunfire that I've personally heard during these clashes over the past six weeks. Clearly some of it automatic weapons, some of it sounds like it's coming from rooftops. ""I haven't seen any weapons on this side -- I haven't seen any protesters firing weapons but they are breaking bricks, throwing rocks -- it's not clear what they're throwing at. But there's a lot of chaos here."" Two hours later, Sayah said the outcome of the gunfight had been ""incredibly bloody."" ""Over the hours we've seen one body after another pass through to a makeshift clinic."" Egypt explained: 6 key questions . On the other side of the square, Damon said riot police had been firing tear gas ""as groups of pro-Morsy demonstrators tried to break through police lines to join the encampment."" Military units could be seen behind the riot police, she said. ""At least four ambulances passed through the police lines on their way toward the site of the sit-in.

In the chaos of the raids, it has been impossible for CNN to verify the claims and counterclaims of protester casualties. State TV reported that at least 149 people had been killed and more than 1,400 wounded. The Muslim Brotherhood said earlier that 200 Morsy supporters were killed and more than 8,000 were injured.

"(CNN) -- There's no need to worry about another Hurricane Sandy. The name has now been retired from the official list of names for Atlantic tropical storms, the World Meteorological Organization said Friday. Officials decided Sandy caused so much death and destruction when it hit the Caribbean and the U.S. East Coast in October last year that the name should be removed from the rotating list, according to organization spokeswoman Claire Nullis. Starting in 2018, the next year that Sandy was due on the list again as the ""S"" name in the annual alphabetical rundown of storm names, the name will be replaced with Sara, Nullis said. The World Meteorological Organization is a U.N. agency that maintains the list of Atlantic tropical storms and decides which names to retire. Names are removed from the list ""if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity,"" according to the U.S. National Weather Service. Other names on the retired list include Igor, Gustav, Ike, Paloma, Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan and Wilma. Hurricane Sandy developed last October and moved through Jamaica and Cuba before hitting Haiti, where it left 51 people dead. The storm was downgraded to a tropical storm but strengthened again to a Category 2 hurricane as it crept up the U.S. East Coast. Sandy was a huge storm, with winds extending 175 miles from its eye, making it much larger than most storms of its type. Much of the damage it caused was while the storm was still out at sea. By the time Sandy did make landfall again -- as a post-tropical cyclone, on the southern coast of New Jersey -- it had become known as Superstorm Sandy for the combination of weather events and disasters that it brought about. The storm killed at least 113 people in the United States and 18 in Canada and is one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","The World Meteorological Association decides to retire the name .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Some state-run enterprises in China have opulent headquarters more suited to the court of Louis XIV of France, while other local government-owned buildings even replicate the home of the President of the United States. Clearly, in recent decades, money has been no object in the world's second biggest economy. But Beijing's bean counters, a more socially-aware bunch in recent times, have decided enough is enough and imposed a ban on the construction of new government buildings, according to state media. A yawning gap between rich and poor and a social media-led backlash against corruption and official excesses, has made the ruling Communist Party led by President Xi Jinping all too aware of the perils of continuing down such a corrosive path. Opinion: Corruption as China's top priority . And so the General Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued a directive that calls for an across-the-board halt to the construction of new government buildings, training centers or hotels in the coming five years, the Xinhua news agency reported. The directive accuses some departments and localities of breaking building regulations when approving, and calls on all CPC and government bodies to be ""frugal and ensure that government funds and resources are spent on developing the economy and boosting the public's well-being,"" Xinhua said. Expensive and unnecessary renovations will also be prohibited, with only projects that ""erase safety risks"" or ""restore office functions,"" allowed. Ominously, the directive says officials who approve banned projects should be ""harshly punished."" Perhaps the best example of the type of extravagant constructions being targeted is in northeastern China, where the state-owned Harbin Pharmaceutical Group has its main offices. The remarkable complex is modeled on the Palace of Versailles outside Paris, France and features incredible ornate hallways with crystal chandeliers and gold paneling along the walls. Since coming to power late last year, President Xi has made corruption and excess his chief targets. In several speeches since he officially took over the reins of the Communist Party in November, he warned that corruption could lead to ""the collapse of the Party and the downfall of the state."" He has repeatedly urged officials to ""build a clean government, show self-discipline and restrain their relatives and associates."" According to Xinhua, the new building ban is an important part of ""building a more transparent government and strengthening ties between the CPC and the public."" ""In order to let the people live comfortably, the government has to tighten its belt and cut its own spending,"" said Professor Wang Yukai from the Chinese Academy of Governance, in quotes carried by Xinhua.","China has imposed a five-year ban on the construction of new government buildings .
State-owned pharmaceutical company has HQ that rivals Palace of Versailles .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The Costa Concordia, a half-submerged carcass of a cruise liner, still sits in the harbor where it ran aground. It looks out of place amid the calm blue waters, which belie the chaos of a year ago. One year ago Sunday, the luxury liner struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio, killing 32 people. Several hundred survivors of that wreck and residents plan to commemorate the disaster by holding a memorial Mass and observing a minute of silence. Also, at 9:45 p.m. local time, the moment of impact, they will light and release 32 lanterns -- one for each of the victims. About 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members were on board the ship that night. Many were attending a magic show and some thought, when the lights first went out, that the sudden darkness was part of the performance. According to passengers' accounts, chaos erupted as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard; remaining members seemed helpless to handle the melee. The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, could face charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship. Other Concordia executives and crew members also could face trial. Schettino has said that managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area. Meanwhile, the liner is still sitting in the water. More than 420 people are working 24-7 to secure it, but salvage efforts are taking longer than expected. Officials now hope to have the ship upright by late June or early July and to tow it to some port by September. That represents a delay by a few months. ""We are working round the clock to get the job done as fast as we can,"" said Nick Sloane, head of salvage operations. ""There is a lot of calculating, recalculating and validating the calculations in an operation like this,"" he told CNN. ""There is no room for mistakes."" The workers, of whom 110 are divers, live on a floating barge. There is the constant buzz of generators and drills in Giglio's harbor. The search for two people who remain missing will continue alongside salvage operations, said Franco Gabrielli, head of the Italian Civil Protection agency. The Costa Concordia cannot stay in its current position, as it represents a danger for the environment, said Gabrielli. A portion of Giglio's coastal waters is designated as a protected marine habitat.","Several hundred passengers are in Giglio to commemorate the anniversary .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's new First Lady is poised to impress--and burnish China's image overseas. Peng Liyuan, wife of China's new president Xi Jinping, made her debut as China's First Lady this week accompanying Xi in his first overseas trip as China's new state president. Wearing a belted overcoat, accented by a stand-up collar and a light-blue scarf, she stood next to Xi when they arrived in Moscow, the first stop of Xi's three-nation trip. Smiling radiantly, she shook hands with the Russian hosts, a step or two behind her husband. ""We've always looked forward to having an elegant First Lady that's presentable to the outside world,"" a Chinese official told me. ""Now we have one."" Many Chinese are similarly enthused.: ""The U.S. has Michelle (Obama), we have Peng Liyuan,"" wrote micro-blogger @mlxftmilixiaofantuan. Peng, 51, hardly needs help when it comes to public relations. She is a popular soprano, widely known in China for her soaring, glass-breaking voice and patriotic folk songs. Her top hits include ""People from Our Village"" and ""On the Plains of Hope."" Will she be as good a First Lady as she is a soprano? ""Of course,"" the Chinese official replied. ""She looks elegant, she is a successful professional and she comes from a modest background."" Peng was born to a family of artists in Shandong Province. Her mother was a member of a local art troupe; her father was a curator of local museum. In a TV talk-show interview a few years ago, Peng recalled the time when as a child she first saw a camera brought home by her father, who refused to take her picture because the camera was ""state-owned,"" not a family property. Later, her uncle secretly took her picture that became her only childhood portrait. At age 14, Peng enrolled at a local university of art and design. Four years later, she joined the arts troupe of the People's Liberation Army as a soprano. She holds a master's degree in traditional ethnic music and now serves as the dean of the Art Academy of the People's Liberation Army. She holds the rank of a major general. Peng became a superstar in 1983, when she sang in the first Lunar New Year's TV extravaganza, broadcast nationwide by state-owned China Central Television (CCTV). The gala show was big hit and has since become the most watched and lucratively sponsored TV show in China, comparable to the annual Superbowl in the United States. Peng had performed in the annual TV gala show almost every year until 2007, when Xi was promoted into the top-tier of the Communist Party, making him the presumptive paramount leader of China. Peng quietly faded from public view. She has taken up charity-related positions with limited exposure. In those roles, political analysts say, Peng has helped soften Xi Jinping's public image. She became an ambassador for tobacco control in 2009. Last year, she was appointed as the ambassador for the fight against tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS for the World Health Organization, an initiative aided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Chinese analysts think Peng can similarly help burnish China's image overseas by projecting a softer touch. ""I believe Peng has the prerequisites and the ability to contribute to China's diplomacy,"" said Liu Guchang, a former ambassador to Russia. Still, the idea of a high-profile Chinese First Lady conjures the ghost of Jiang Qing, Chairman Mao's fourth wife. A film starlet who later rose to the pinnacle of political power during the Cultural Revolution, Jiang was often depicted as an Iron Lady who rode on the coattails of her omnipotent husband. Before she was arrested and jailed in the late 1970s, Jiang Qing was the high-profile cultural czar during the last years of Chairman Mao's rule. She sat in the elite communist party politburo and served as the final arbiter of political correctness in China's art and culture. I had never met Jiang Qing, but I do remember seeing her inside Beijing's Capital Theater one night in November 1971, when we watched the ""Red Detachment of Women,"" a revolution-themed ballet she had co-produced. A few minutes before the show started, the theater lights dimmed and a group of VIPs took the front seats. She was one of them, it turned out. All through the show, I saw her giving show-related instructions to the officials beside her. In contrast to Jiang Qing, China's First Ladies in the 1980s and 90's kept a low public profile. Deng Xiaoping's wife, Zhuo Lin, stayed in the background even when she accompanied Deng during his travels in and outside China. Wang Yeping rarely tagged along Chinese president Jiang Zemin, in part because of her frail health. Liu Yongqing, wife of former president Hu Jintao, rarely appeared â€” and almost never spoke â€” in public, even inside China. Many Chinese expect Peng Liyuan to break the old mold. ""Her human touch will get Xi closer to the people,"" wrote microblogger @Laiyingutou. ""Compared to former first ladies in China, she will definitely get more attention."" Li Yinhe, a sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the Communist Party would be wise to use Peng as a ""soft weapon"" at home and abroad. ""If people see that Xi has such a beautiful wife, it would make the (communist) party seem more human and less robotic,"" she told the New York Times. Still, Peng's fans have one slight worry. ""Our only concern is, she might unintentionally upstage our No. 1 leader,"" said one.

"Jinan, China (CNN) -- The trial of disgraced Chinese Communist Party high-flyer Bo Xilai concluded Monday with a dramatic final flourish as he accused the former police chief who brought about his downfall of having a crush on his wife. Bo's politically sensitive corruption trial has brought forth a plethora of rich, eye-opening details about the apparently lavish and emotionally fraught life of his family and inner circle, giving Chinese people insights into how some of the ruling elite live. But at the same time, doubts have arisen about the completeness of the account of court proceedings provided by Chinese authorities. Still, over the past five days, the court has heard allegations of adultery, a punch to the head, squabbles over a villa on the French Riviera and attempts to cover up the murder of a British businessman. Was Bo's trial truly transparent? As the trial wrapped up Monday, the prosecution called for Bo to be strictly punished over the charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. The court in the eastern city of Jinan said the verdict would be announced at a later date. Bo, a charismatic and divisive leader when he was in power, has kept up a steady attack on the case against him throughout the hearings. In comments Monday published by the court, Bo complained that ""not even the worst TV script writers could come up with such plots"" as some of the bribery accusations. But he then proceeded to describe a storyline worthy of a soap opera, suggesting a romantic link between two figures who played central roles in the drama that ended his political career. The people in question are Wang Lijun, Bo's former police chief in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, whose failed attempt to defect to the United States in February 2012 precipitated the crisis that shook the Communist Party to its foundations; and Gu Kailai, Bo's wife, who is now in prison after a court convicted her last year of murdering Neil Heywood, a British businessman and associate of the Bo family. Prosecutors accuse Bo of threatening and improperly firing Wang after learning of Gu's suspected involvement in Heywood's murder. Five things not to have missed . A punch or a slap? Wang, who is now serving a 15-year prison sentence for multiple offenses, said in testimony over the weekend that upon learning of the suspicions, Bo punched him in the head, bloodying his mouth and causing a ""discharge"" from his ear. Wang told prosecutors that Bo's physical violence against him, as well as the disappearance of his aides and investigators, led to his decision to seek refuge in the U.S. diplomatic mission in Chengdu. Bo denies punching Wang, claiming it was just a slap. And over the weekend, he questioned Wang's reliability, saying ""this man has extremely bad character and lies on the spot."" In his statement Monday, Bo offered a new explanation for Wang's attempted defection. ""The true reason of Wang Lijun's flight was because he had a crush on Gu Kailai and he couldn't get over it,"" Bo said, alleging that Wang had confessed his feelings to Gu and ""slapped himself eight times."" In written and video testimony shown in court last week, Gu linked Bo to some of the crimes the prosecution alleges. Bo responded by suggesting that as she'd already been convicted, she lacked credibility and was seeking a more lenient sentence. The allegation of Wang's feelings for Gu added a fresh layer of intrigue to the case, which has drawn widespread interest on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblog service. The court's official Weibo account, which provided updates on developments inside the courtroom, now has more than half a million followers. How and why Chinese politician veered off script . Doubts about the court's reporting . But with journalists from the international news media denied access to the courtroom, the comprehensiveness of the court's version of events is in question. The official microblog reported only selected parts of what transpired during the trial, two individuals with detailed knowledge of the court proceedings told CNN. The microblog leaves out some parts that may put Bo in a good light, they said. Some of Bo's courtroom comments expunged from the official account include his detailing of threats made against him and his family by investigators, the sources told CNN. During his incarceration, according to those sources, Bo said investigators warned him of the possibility of his wife's execution and his son's arrest, and told him about the cases of other prominent officials -- one of whom confessed and was spared and another who did not cooperate and was executed. Bo spoke for almost half an hour on Monday, much longer than what the court transcripts show, according to the sources. They said after Bo delivered his closing remarks, five family members in court stood up, clapping and saying: ""Well said, Xilai! We will always be with you."" Despite the restrictions on the flow of information, Chinese state-run media have highlighted the microblog disclosures as a new level of transparency. ""They see this as an opportunity to present China as a country where rule of law is developing and where the judicial system is becoming more mature,"" said political commentator and columnist Frank Ching. ""But at the same time, they want to have some control."" Timeline: Bo Xilai scandal . 'A good legal mind' Based on the information that the court has divulged, Bo has come across as a combative defendant, denying allegations against him and attacking the credibility of prosecution witnesses. ""I think he has performed very well in court,"" Ching said. ""He seems to have a good legal mind and has been able to argue his own case very well."" But despite his assertive performance, many observers still expect him to be convicted in a legal system where the Communist Party controls police, prosecution and courts. Bo appeared to acknowledge his likely fate during his final statement Monday. ""There are times when I felt weak, because I know I'm doomed and there's no escape for me,"" he said. ""Ending up in prison, I have mixed feelings toward the rest of my life."" Trial by social media . The rise of a princeling . Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. With the help of Wang, he was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing. Bo's populist policies drew admirers and detractors, but he ultimately ran afoul of party power brokers. Long underwear from the 1960s . His high profile and connections among the nation's ruling elite have made his case an extremely delicate matter for Chinese authorities. The court hearings have included plentiful details about the jet-set lifestyle led by Bo's wife and youngest son, which prosecutors allege was funded by rich businessmen to secure influence from Bo. The favors mentioned include a villa in the South of France, and trips to destinations around the globe for the son, Bo Guagua, who is now living in the United States. Bo Xilai has denied he knew details about where the money was coming from. And on Monday, he sought to play up his Spartan credentials. ""I have no interest in clothing,"" he said. ""My thermal long underpants were bought by my mother in the 1960s."" Nonetheless, the portrait that has emerged of Bo, his family and their former position near the top of the Chinese system has proved revealing. ""Since the founding of the Communist Party and the People's Republic, this has been the only time that connections among the party, government, judiciary, politicians' private lives, as well as power and interests, are explained in such a clear, public and entertaining way,"" the dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei wrote on his Twitter account. CNN's Steven Jiang reported from Jinan, Jaime Florcruz reported from from Beijing, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's David McKenzie in Jinan contributed to this report.","The trial concludes after five days of hearings in the eastern city of Jinan .

"(CNN) -- Cold and shivering, Habiba Ahmed Abd Elaziz exchanged worried texts with her mother Wednesday morning as Egyptian security forces moved toward and blocked roads leading to a protest camp in Cairo. ""The crowds are massive and on high alert. Pray for us, mother."" ""I entrust you to God the Almighty,"" her mother responded. ""I'm heading to the platform in a little while. There are tanks there,"" Elaziz replied. It was her last text. Elaziz, 26, was one of the scores of people killed as security forces stormed Rabaa al-Adawiya camp filled with supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. It was not clear who fired the bullet during clashes between the two sides. The dramatic text exchange, published by The National, was confirmed to CNN by Elaziz's younger sister, Arwa Ramadan. A staff reporter with the United Arab Emirates-based Xpress weekly newspaper, Elaziz was in her native Egypt in a personal capacity, having celebrated the Eid holiday. She was assisting the injured at the camp, according to Ramadan. Bloodiest day since revolution marks new 'beginning' for Egypt . Elaziz joined Xpress as an intern in September 2011 and later took a full-time position, according to Dubai-based Gulf News, a sister publication. ""It's hard to believe she's gone,"" said Xpress deputy editor Mazha Farooqui. ""She was passionate about her work and had a promising career ahead."" Clashes turn square into bloody 'war zone' Without knowing what had happened, Elaziz's mother, who lives in Sharjah, an emirate in the United Arab Emirates, texted a prayer to her daughter and wrote a message of support for protesters in Egypt. ""God I entrust to you with my husband Ahmed and my daughter Habiba. May we not be bereaved over any of them. God empower them and support them and keep them steadfast at the moment of encounter today."" And then this text: . ""Habiba, please reassure me. I've called thousands of times. Please, my darling, I'm worried sick. Tell me how you are."" The mother called Elaziz's phone around noon. Someone picked up the phone and told her the young journalist was dead.

"Washington (CNN) -- A hotly debated measure that offers a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children won approval Wednesday from the U.S. House. The 216-198 vote, mostly on partisan lines, sends the so-called DREAM Act to the Senate, where it was uncertain if supporters had the votes to overcome a certain Republican filibuster against it. The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act -- or DREAM -- would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in America for at least five years, obtained a high school or General Education Development diploma and demonstrated ""good moral character,"" according to a White House fact sheet. Even then, only a six-year conditional status would be awarded, and before moving to the next phase, the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years, and passing criminal background checks. Proponents, including President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders, say the bill offers legal standing to young people brought to the United States who have bettered themselves and served their new country, while opponents claim it is a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants. Before Wednesday's House vote, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano joined congressional Democrats at a news conference to urge Congress to pass the bill. ""These are not the individuals that are a threat to our public safety or our security,"" Napolitano said. ""This is an area where ... our nation's immigration laws have not kept up with our nation's needs."" The White House has touted the bill as a measure that will strengthen the nation's military and its economy. A potential beneficiary is Cesar Vargas, a soon-to-be law school graduate with a 3.8 average who wants to serve in the U.S. military. Under current law, Vargas won't even be able to hold a job after he graduates, much less enlist. He is in the country illegally after being brought to New York from Mexico as a child. ""All I want is the opportunity to serve my country and to give back to the country that has given me so much,"" Vargas said. ""... We're not a problem. We're the solution."" However, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the bill could grant amnesty to more than 2 million illegal immigrants. ""Mass amnesty is not the only problem with the DREAM Act,"" said Smith, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. ""The bill allows illegal immigrants to receive in-state tuition at public universities, placing them ahead of U.S. citizens. The bill also is a magnet for fraud."" The White House disputed that the bill will give amnesty, noting in a fact sheet that ""it requires responsibility and accountability of young people who apply to adjust their status under the DREAM Act, creating a lengthy and rigorous process."" It also points out that DREAM Act beneficiaries would not be eligible for federal grants, such as Pell Grants, to attend college. ""Undocumented youth adjusting to lawful permanent resident status are only eligible for federal student loans which must be paid back, and federal work-study programs where they must work for any benefit they receive,"" according to the White House. ""This is not some dream road, easy-picking concession of the Congress of the United States, of the government, to American citizenship,"" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, who delivered an impassioned plea on behalf of the measure. ""No Pell Grant. I'd like to see you get through college without a Pell Grant. No government assistance ... no health care. Nothing. Nothing but your own faith and your own determination and your own work to get you through school. And nothing but your own work, your own determination to join the military."" Beneficiaries will receive in-state tuition in their state of residence, the same as any student, he said. The Congressional Budget Office has said the measure would cut the federal deficit by $1.4 billion and increase government revenues by $2.3 billion over the next decade. Young people who do not fulfill the act's requirements will lose their legal status and would be subject to deportation, according to the White House fact sheet. DREAM Act applicants would be responsible for paying the processing fees associated with their applications, and would be subject to ""rigorous criminal background checks and reviews."" DREAM Act beneficiaries would not be able to petition for legal status for their family members until after they had satisfied all the requirements. They would also be subject to waiting periods. ""The bottom line is that it would take many years before parents or siblings who previously entered the country illegally could obtain a green card,"" the White House said. CNN's Jim Barnett and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: The House votes 216-198 to pass the DREAM Act .

"(CNN) -- Iran's top human rights official said the Islamic regime is reviewing a sentence of execution by stoning for a woman convicted of adultery. ""Sentences such as stoning will be closely reviewed and probably changed,"" Mohammad Javad Larijani told Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. Larijani was referring to the well-publicized case of Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani, who faces the possibility of execution after being convicted in 2006 of adultery. Her lawyer, Mohommad Mostafaei, told CNN that Ashtiani confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. She later recanted that confession and has denied wrongdoing, he said. Her conviction was based not on evidence but on the determination of three out of five judges, he added. She has asked forgiveness from the court but the judges refused to grant clemency. Iran's supreme court upheld the conviction in 2007. Ashtiani's case has drawn international attention and many human rights activists have called for the sentence to be changed. In London, England on Saturday, protesters waved flags and chanted anti-government slogans to the beat of a drum in front of the Iranian Embassy. They condemned executions in Iran -- by hanging and stoning. ""Stop the hanging in Iran -- now, now, now. Stop the stoning in Iran -- now, now, now."" But Larijani said protests from outside Iran will not affect Ashtiani's case. ""The Western attacks have no effect on the opinion of our judges,"" he told the news agency. Larijani's comments seemed to contradict Iran's first public statement on the case made Thursday by the Iranian Embassy in London, England, which suggested Ashtiani would not be stoned. It said ""this mission denies the false news aired in this respect and ... according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in Iran, she will not be executed by stoning punishment. ""It is notable that this kind of punishment has rarely been implemented in Iran and various means and remedies must be probed and exhausted to finally come up with such a punishment,"" the embassy said. Ashtiani's son, who appealed Wednesday to Iran's courts to spare his mother's life, said he won't accept any decision short of his mother's freedom. Through human rights activist Mina Ahadi, Sajjad Mohammedie Ashtiani said she would be satisfied only when Iran's judiciary officially drops the charges against her. Ahadi has told CNN that only an international campaign designed to pressure the Islamic regime in Tehran could save Sakineh Ashtiani's life. ""Legally, it's all over,"" said Ahadi, who heads the International Committee Against Stoning and the Death Penalty, earlier this week. Ashtiani's son wrote in an open letter to government officials that there was neither evidence nor legal grounds for his mother's conviction and sentence. He said the family has traveled six times from their home in Tabriz to Tehran to speak with Iranian officials, but in vain. ""So I have no option but reaching out to them this way,"" he said earlier in the week. Why, he asked, has an accused been twice prosecuted on the same charge when Islamic criminal law allows prosecution only once? Sajjad Ashtiani told CNN that he visits his mother every Monday in jail, never knowing whether that meeting will be their last.","Sakineh Mohammadie Ashtiani was convicted of adultery .
She was sentenced to be stoned to death .

"New York (CNN) -- A leading philanthropist and cosmetics tycoon plans to donate 78 Cubist works to the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, a gift described by the institution as ""truly transformational."" Leonard A. Lauder will donate 33 works by Pablo Picasso and 17 by Georges Braques, two iconic artists considered pioneers of the Cubist movement. He will also give the Met 14 pieces by Fernand Leger and 14 others by Juan Gris, according to the museum. Lauder's collection, approved by the museum board Tuesday, was acquired over nearly four decades. The four artists were on the cusp of the radical Cubist movement in the early 1900s, a period underrepresented in the Met's current exhibition encompassing more than 5,000 years of art history, according to museum officials. In a news release, the museum said Lauder's collection, ""unsurpassed in the number of masterpieces and iconic works critical to the development of Cubism,"" will fill the spaces where representations of modern art had been lacking. Cubists focused on the two dimensional picture plane, attempting visual deception by combining geometric shapes to portray real objects, oft incorporating fragments of reproduced pop culture. The Cubist movement annihilated the traditional illusionism style that triumphed in years prior. It provided a gateway to abstract expression, historians say, changing the very definition of art. Forbes values the collection at $1.1 billion. ""This is an extraordinary gift to our museum and our city,"" Thomas P. Campbell, director of the museum, said in a news release. Campbell said the Met has ""long lacked this critical dimension in the story of modernism,"" noting that the pieces are transformational to the museum. ""Now, Cubism will be represented with some of its greatest masterpieces, demonstrating both its role as the groundbreaking movement of the 20th century and the foundation for an artistic dialogue that continues today,"" Campbell said. Lauder said he hopes his gifts will draw more people to the museum. ""This is a gift to the people who live and work in New York, and those from around the world who come to visit our great arts institutions,"" Lauder said in a news release Tuesday. Lauder has long been entwined with New York City's art institutions, serving as president and chairman of the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as various committees at the Met since the 1980s. He said he chose the Met because ""it's essential that Cubism -- and the art that follows it for that matter -- be seen and studied within the collections of one of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world."" The collection will be presented for the first time in an exhibit due to open in the fall of 2014, according to museum officials. The highlights of the historical collection include Picasso's provocative ""Woman in an Armchair (Eva),"" (1913), an erotic image of Picasso's mistress Eva Gouel, according to the museum's review. Lauder's collection includes early works believed to have been inspired at Cubism's inception. Braque's ""Terrace at the Hotel Mistral, L'Estaque"" (1907) marks the icons transition from fauvism to Cubism, the museum said. Braque's ""Trees at L'Estaque"""" is thought to have inaugurated Cubism, officials say. Picasso's ""The Oil Mill"" (1909) is also historic among the landmark works. It was one of the first Cubist pictures printed in Italy in the Florentine journal La Voce, according the museum's overview of the collection. It prompted modernization from Italian futurists who sought to rival their French peers. Along with the collection, the Met announced the creation of the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art to serve as a mecca for scholars and curators studying Cubism. Lauder is the chairman emeritus of the Estee Lauder Co. and son of the late cosmetics queen by the same name.","Leonard A. Lauder will donate 33 works by Pablo Picasso .

"London (CNN) -- David Bowie always did have impeccable timing. He released his song about a doomed astronaut, ""Space Oddity,"" just days before the 1969 Moon landing. Four years later he killed off his most famous creation, the other-worldly ""Ziggy Stardust,"" just at the point it threatened to overwhelm him. More than 130 million record sales later, Bowie is back after a relatively quiet decade (he underwent emergency heart surgery in 2004). He celebrated his 66th birthday in January by releasing ""Where Are We Now,"" his first song for more than 10 years, without any warning. His 27th studio album, ""The Next Day,"" is riding high at the top of UK charts, earning critical acclaim. This weekend the doors will open on an extraordinary exhibition of Bowie's life and career at the V&A Museum in London. ""David Bowie Is"" chronicles the rise of an unknown singer called David Jones from the south London suburbs through his ""Ziggy Stardust"" heyday and his later ground-breaking years spent holed up in Berlin. It also takes in his many acting roles and acclaimed fashion designs over the years. Read why Bowie is back to his mysterious best . The exhibition's curators, Geoffrey Marsh and Victoria Broackes, have had full access to the star's archives, which means they have almost everything worth having. ""Most bands go bust or split up,"" says Marsh, ""so to find a collection in one place which represents 40 or 50 years is pretty rare. ""There's a whole generation which has grown up with him and although they find the idea of him in a museum a bit strange I think the fact that he can do that and produce a successful new album at the same time actually shows what a remarkable person he is."" The exhibition features for the first time more than 300 objects from Bowie's life, from amazing stage outfits to rare photographs from the early years, videos of outstanding live performances screened in a thunderously loud surround-sound cinema, Bowie's own musical instruments, record cover designs and paintings. ""When you see the costumes close up it is really thrilling,"" says Broackes. ""Nothing beats it really in this age -- when you can do so many things in other ways -- actually seeing the real thing. You might have seen it on TV, you might have seen it on stage or on film, but to see for example the 'Ashes to Ashes' costume close up it's pretty fantastic. We've also got the Ziggy costumes and they're amazing."" The exhibition is creating almost as much of a buzz as Bowie's new music, reflecting the unique position he holds in the British arts and music landscape. As Broackes says: ""Bowie's permeated every area of our culture. He is no ordinary pop star."" ""David Bowie Is"" at the V&A in central London, and runs from March 23 until August 11.","Doors to open on exhibition of life of David Bowie at V&A museum in London .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Even in the best of times, running a charity isn't easy. Try doing it during a recession. ""Individual giving has declined. Foundations, which give us funding, have lost money and can't give what they have in the past,"" said Jim LoBianco, executive director of StreetWise Inc., a Chicago nonprofit that assists men and women who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. ""We're struggling."" LoBianco's job got easier, however, once he met Judson Kinnucan. Kinnucan, 37, has made it his mission to collect donated goods in Chicago, sort through them and get them to charities in need. For LoBianco, help came in the form of free toiletries for the shelters that StreetWise works with. Now, every month, Kinnucan delivers about 200 pounds of donated shampoo, conditioner and lotion and about 1,000 rolls of toilet paper. During the three years they've worked together, LoBianco estimates, Kinnucan has brought them more than $20,000 worth of products -- for free. ""Judson builds these relationships with donors, gets these products and then brings them to us,"" LoBianco said. ""Having someone that is willing to do all the legwork is essentially saving an agency like us a full-time employee. I can't stress how invaluable he is."" More than 200 charities across Chicago have benefited from Kinnucan's unique brand of assistance. Since 2009, he has collected 145,000 pounds of goods -- estimated to be worth more than $1 million -- through his nonprofit, Bin Donated. The idea is simple. He places 55-gallon bins across the city, in residential areas and businesses such as dental offices and hotels, where people can deposit reusable goods. Then, every weekend, he gathers the donated contents, sorts them with the help of volunteers and distributes the goods to local nonprofits that need them. ""When people come up to a bin, I have signage that says exactly what's needed. ... I make sure everything is very focused,"" Kinnucan said. ""I do my research and find out what they need and collect that, or find places that need what I have."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Russell Eiermann, director of housekeeping at Chicago's Drake Hotel, was always bothered by the half-empty toiletries the housekeepers had to throw away at the end of each guest's stay. He'd tried to find groups to come and pick up the items, but for various reasons, it had never worked out. Then he found Kinnucan. Now, Eiermann's staff collects the used amenities on their carts and puts them in Bin Donated barrels at the end of the day. When the bins are full, Kinnucan picks them up. ""For (him) to actually take this and give it to somebody that needs this is a relief,"" Eiermann said. ""It's nice knowing that my staff is supporting that and there's people getting to benefit from it instead of just tossing it away."" Most charities don't mind receiving partially used goods. ""It's not about aesthetics for our clients,"" LoBianco said. ""Things may not look as pretty as they do if you go into a retail store and buy it over the counter. The fact is that those items, whether it's soap or shampoo or half a roll of toilet paper, (are) critical to the men and women that StreetWise serves."" Kinnucan came up with the idea of Bin Donated when a friend was having a ""clean out the closet"" event. The friend asked Kinnucan whether he knew anyone who would pick up all the donations. He didn't, but he had an epiphany. He had recently left his job as a recruiter, where he had matched people with the right job. Maybe he could do something similar for charities. ""I would be the middleman. Find the goods, pick them up and drop them off,"" he said. ""I would be able to save time and money for these charities, and in turn, they could focus on what they do."" Hygiene products, like those provided to StreetWise, make up the majority of Kinnucan's donations. But over the years, he has collected and distributed thousands of pounds of food as well as school supplies, toys and books. He is also known locally as the man who will accept any and all donations. When a sales company had 8,000 pencil sharpeners to contribute, Kinnucan brought them to charities that work with school-age children. One company donated 150 alarm clocks; Kinnucan gave them to a nonprofit that provides housing to people with mental illness. And when a local hotel was replacing 75 ice buckets and 55 coffee makers, Kinnucan parceled them out to various nonprofits in the area. ""The idea behind a donation drive has been around for eons,"" Kinnucan said. ""The difference is, I'm collecting for everybody."" There's another benefit to Kinnucan's work: By delivering goods to those who need them, he's also keeping the items out of landfills. ""For a lot of companies or individuals, it's easier to just throw it away -- out of sight, out of mind,"" he said. ""So really, the concept behind Bin Donated is to reduce, reuse, recycle and get another opportunity to have someone to use that item, whatever it might be. ""It's a win-win situation. We help the charities and the environment at the same time."" After working full-time on the project for nearly two years, Kinnucan is now working as a recruiter again and keeping the organization going on weekends. Having sunk his entire savings and 401(k) into the nonprofit, he would love to take his idea national one day. ""Listen, if I won the Lotto, I would do this bigger,"" he said. ""But (right now) I can't, so I'm going to keep on helping the people of Chicago. ""I get dirty and sweaty, and it's back-breaking work, but it's fun, and it makes me happy. I set out to make a difference, and that's what I'm doing."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Money's tight and gas prices are high, but a change of scenery is good for the soul. As much of the country tries to balance prices at the pump with the all-American summer vacation, we asked six reporters across the country to share easy road trip recommendations from their stomping grounds. CNN's Reynolds Wolf filled up a gas-guzzling Ford Expedition for $99 and traveled east from Waycross, Georgia, to the coastal islands and up to Spanish moss-draped Savannah in a day. Watch the video above to check out that adventure and read on for five more one-tank trip ideas. On a budget? Take a road trip . MINNESOTA . From: Minneapolis, Minnesota To: Brainerd, Minnesota Average price/gallon of regular gas in Minneapolis: *$3.52 ($2.73 a year ago) Miles, round-trip: about 250 miles Travel time: About 2½ hours each way . If you call the Twin Cities of Minnesota home, the chain of lakes up near Brainerd makes for a great change of pace, perfect for anyone who needs a little break from summer construction and traffic jams in the metro area. The Brainerd Lakes Area, home to more than 450 lakes, is about 125 miles from Minneapolis -- a doable one-tank trip. Skip the hotels or fancy lodges and try logging on to the website Vacation Rentals By Owner for a cabin tailored to your needs. These lakes are home to hundreds of cabins, suitable for families large and small. It can be very economical, not to mention convenient, to have a little house all to yourself. I found a little cabin on Upper Gull Lake with its own stretch of beach and free use of the owner's canoe. The cabin was essentially one large room with a nice queen-size bed, a sitting area with TV, a kitchenette and a bathroom. As for dining, if you want a fun family atmosphere where you can literally pull up your boat and order, check out Zorbaz on the Lake. It has a big kid-friendly menu and unique adult beverage concoctions, too. This spot can be a little touristy, so if quiet time is a priority for you, just bring something to throw on a grill or makeshift campfire by the beach. There's plenty of fishing in the area, as well as golf, trails and swimming, and at night you'll have no problem hearing the occasional call of the loon. Not a bad way to spend a night -- or even two. -- Chris Welch . WASHINGTON . From: Kingston, Washington To: Rialto Beach, Olympic Peninsula Average price/gallon of regular gas in Seattle: $3.83 (price a year ago $3.00) Miles, round-trip: About 260 Travel time: About three hours each way . When summer finally arrives in Seattle there's not a moment to spare to take full advantage of the long days and spectacular natural beauty. Everyone here knows how quickly the grey and drizzly weather can return. Luckily you can drive in any direction from Seattle and come across amazing scenery. My favorite trip is to head West to the Olympic Peninsula, which lies between Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean, and is home to towering snow-capped mountains and Olympic National Park. With temperate rainforests, mountains and amazing camping and fishing, there are more activities in the Olympics than one tank of gas can carry you to. I try to branch out when I go, but one spot I always come back to is Rialto Beach near the Peninsula's westernmost edge. The trip begins with a short car ferry ride across Puget Sound from Edmonds, just north of Seattle. Depending on the size of your gas tank, this trip might be a bit of a stretch on one tank, but it's worth it. You can fill up in Kingston, Washington, when you get off the ferry. From there it's about a 130-mile drive to Rialto Beach. Along the way, the town of Sequim offers lots of small-town charm and a few good options for food. I recommend the Alder Wood Bistro, which serves delicious locally caught seafood. If you plan on camping, stop along the way in Port Angeles at the Wilderness Information Center to pick up permits. National Park Service guides are happy to point out camping spots and explain the tide schedule to help with hiking along the beach. I also recommend picking up a bear canister to store your food in away from your tent. As you arrive at Rialto Beach, you'll forget you're only hours from a major metropolis. It's possible to spot bald eagles and the occasional seal along the wild coastline. Thick woods literally come to the ocean's edge. Rock towers that the wind and tides have carved over the centuries jut from the Pacific. Pitch a tent and make a fire at one of the small camping areas along the water's edge, and take in a truly beautiful sunset. -- Patrick Oppmann . GEORGIA . From: Atlanta To: Athens, Georgia Average price/gallon of regular gas in Atlanta: $3.49 ($2.68 a year ago) Miles, round-trip: 144 miles Travel time: An 1½ hours each way (two hours in heavy traffic) Athens is one of those must-see college towns. Home to the University of Georgia, Athens has a small-town feel with all the great, quirky college elements: endless live music, boutique shopping, delicious (and cheap) food and a thriving downtown scene. Drive down the cost of your next road trip . Athens has three main districts: Downtown, Five Points and Prince Avenue. Each has a unique flavor to its funky shops. Wuxtry Records and Heery's Clothes Closet are downtown mainstays, while Prince Avenue's vintage shop Ohh, Boy! and Five Points' antique stores also beckon with unique finds. Stroll through the university's expansive campus to soak up some Athens lore and see Sanford Stadium (home of the Georgia Bulldogs football team), or enjoy a walk through the nearby State Botanical Gardens. A Classic City tour of downtown reveals Athens' intriguing history. Forgo seeing a summer blockbuster and take in an independent film at Ciné downtown, live entertainment at historic Morton Theatre or an aerial trapeze show at Canopy Studio. A trip to the Classic City isn't complete without catching a concert at clubs like the 40 Watt, Caledonia Lounge or the Rialto Room. Sample some of the local flavor. Cali N' Tito's, the Last Resort, La Dolce Vita, Transmetropolitan, the Terrapin brewery and Farm 255 are a nice blend of the unique food culture in Athens. Plan your trip around an event like the Twilight Criterium bike race, a UGA football game or the annual AthFest celebration of local music. -- Ashley Strickland . PENNSYLVANIA . From: Philadelphia To: Doylestown, Pennsylvania Average price/gallon of regular gas in Philadelphia: $3.68 ($2.78 a year ago) Miles, round-trip: About 50 miles Travel time: Less than an hour each way . A short drive from Philadelphia, Doylestown is host to sites tied to two of the area's most famous native sons: author James Michener and tile maker Henry Chapman Mercer. Michener endowed the James A. Michener Art Museum dedicated to the art and heritage of Pennsylvania's Bucks County region. The museum opened in 1988. Currently on view are a Pennsylvania folk arts show and an exhibit dedicated to the museum's first two decades of collecting. The other notable figure is tile maker Mercer, an archaeologist, artist and writer and a leader in the Arts & Crafts movement. Mercer's legacy is reflected in three sites: the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, where the iconic Mercer tiles are made; his fanciful concrete castle, Fonthill; and the Mercer Museum, known for its collection of Early American artifacts. For more shopping, especially crafts, and entertainment check outPeddler's Village, roughly a 10-minute drive from Doylestown. The Colonial-style village features the Giggleberry Fair family entertainment center, charming stores and gardens and an array of restaurants. -- Sarah Hoye . FLORIDA . From: Orlando To: St. Augustine, Florida Average price/gallon of regular gas in Orlando: $3.40 ($2.63 a year ago) Miles, round-trip: About 200 miles Travel time: A little under two hours each way . Need a break from Orlando's castles and fairy princesses? Head to the oldest city in the United States. The city of St. Augustine is just a 90-minute drive from central Florida's amusement park mecca. Founded in 1565 under the orders of King Phillip II of Spain, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously settled city of European origin in the nation. One of Old Town's main attractions, St. George Street, was a thoroughfare in the old Spanish town and today is accessible only on foot. Shops line the street selling everything from shells, hats, kites and candles to crystals. Stop in at the Old School House near the city gates to see what's reputed to be the nation's oldest wooden schoolhouse, built more than 200 years ago. Explore the tight alleyways and stop at Denoel French Pastry Shop for incredible desserts and coffee before heading to the city's historic fort. Construction of the fort, the Castillo de San Marcos, started in 1672 to protect the Spanish city. Now the Castillo is managed by the National Park Service, which offers ranger talks and maps and brochures for self-guided tours . Cross over the ornate Bridge of Lions and head toward the St. Augustine Lighthouse. The eight-story, traditionally black-and-white-striped structure was completed in 1874. Be ready for the 219 steps that will carry visitors to the top of the structure. Once at the top, walk out for a spectacular view of the beach to the east and the city to the west. To end the day, head back to the old town center where restaurants wait to fill up hungry guests before the drive back to central Florida to see Harry, Mickey and Shamu. -- John Couwels . *All fuel prices are AAA average prices on Thursday, June 30, for a gallon of regular gas.","For a peaceful getaway in Minnesota, rent a cabin in the Brainerd Lakes Area .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Wearing a purple polo and stylish Ray Ban sunglasses, Osama Morsy strolled into the interview room calm, confident, and defiant. ""What do I see in the coming days? That the revolution will succeed and that the legitimate leader will return,"" he said. ""The Egyptian people will never again be scared or petrified of a tank or terrorized by detention."" A little more than a week ago, Osama's father, former President Mohamed Morsy, was forcibly ousted by the Egyptian military and swiftly replaced with a civilian transitional government. ""This is a coup of the revolution, a coup on democracy, a coup on the constitution and the will of the people. The defense minister is essentially saying to the millions that voted in presidential elections and on the constitutional referendum, 'you don't know what is best for you. I know what is best for you'."" Despite the younger Morsy's outrage at his father's ouster, the new government is continuing to fill posts. Interim Prime Minister Hazem El-Beblawi said that 70% of the choices for ministers and ministerial posts have been completed, according to the state-run al-Ahram news agency. The final formation of the government is expected to be announced Monday, according to al-Ahram. Experts predict Egypt's future . For the millions of Egyptians who packed the streets in a nationwide revolt on June 30 and screamed ""Leave!"" at Mohamed Morsy, the word ""coup"" is an insult, a dirty term that denigrates what they believe is revolution redux, but Osama vehemently disagrees. ""June 30 was not a revolution! And history will never record it as a revolution. And no one, not the American administration or anyone else, can call it a revolution. Why? Because there is no revolution in the world that brings military rule. There is no revolution in the word that cancels the ballot box."" That sentiment was echoed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan Thursday at a dinner in Ankara, according to Turkey's semi-official news outlet Anadoly Agency. ""Every military coup, regardless of its target, country and reason, is the murderer of the democracy, people and the future of the country,"" Erdogan said, adding that protests in Tahrir Square did not legalize the coup. With a 48-hour deadline imposed by the military looming, Mohamed Morsy spoke to his son for the last time before addressing the country on state television on July 2. ""I asked him on a personal level, as a son, for him to remain defiant and move forward and not retreat in the face of the armed forces,"" he said. ""The Mohamed Morsy that I know is a point of pride as a son, so the Mohamed Morsy that would back down or flee would be shameful to me, even if he stayed president."" Former President Morsy is currently being held in an undisclosed location for his ""personal safety,"" Egyptian armed forces spokesman Col. Ahmed Ali told CNN, but for a son missing his father, these reassurances are meaningless. ""Don't worry about his personal safety. No one, not the defense ministry or interior ministry, should worry about his personal safety,"" Osama said sarcastically. ""If the situation is to hold him in this immoral and illegal detention, then he must be released! And if it is a legal detention, then I welcome that, and let us follow the law."" Reporter notebook: Morsy a victim of Egypt's revolution . The green-eyed father of two had refused to speak in his broken English until the moment he was asked whether he tried to contact his father in custody. ""I am a part of the revolution and I am stronger than asking one of (the military), 'please let me speak to my dad.' No! We are in a revolution. A new wave of the January 25 revolution ... our democracy path, we will not let it go."" The January 25 revolution of 2011 led to the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters remain in detention, and the public prosecutor has issued dozens of arrest warrants for top leadership, but the younger Morsy chose to meet in broad daylight at one of the most recognizable mosques in Cairo. ""The revolution will succeed. The revolution that ended the Mubarak regime will continue strong. We know no other way than success,"" Osama continued. ""This is a peaceful revolution against a bloody coup, but this revolution will be even more important than January 25 because it will strike at the root. This time the revolution will confront the apparatuses of Mubarak, not just the man himself."" More than two years after a popular uprising toppled former President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year dictatorship, Egypt's various political factions struggle for the ownership of their beloved ""thawra,"" or revolution, a faceless and leaderless movement both the Brotherhood and its organized opposition seek to co-opt. ""We elected (Morsy) and succeeded him so he can confront challenges by the principles of the revolution, the concepts of a democratic transition, with sound democracy, and in this transition, individuals are not as important as the will of the masses."" Over and over again, the 30-year-old judge repeated the well-being of his father is secondary to the principles of democracy and the demands of thousands of pro-Morsy supporters staging a sit-in just outside the window. On Thursday, Morsy supporters continued their sit-in at Rabaa El-Adawiya and has planned to break their Ramadan fast there, Nile State TV reported. ""Mohamed Morsy, even though he is the president and even though he is elected and the legitimate leader, and despite his international standing and his role in the revolution,n he is not more important than the people killed at the Republican Guard,"" Osama said, referring to the deaths of 51 people in clashes earlier this week. Despite his bold resilience, Osama longed to reach out to his missing father. He turned, looked straight into the camera and delivered this message: . ""Dad, you are the legitimate leader, you are the elected leader and elected president. We back any decision you take, even if you decided to leave the office. Your family, we are all proud of you. God bless you."" CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Ali Younes, Mohammed Tawfeeq and journalist Sarah El Sirgany contributed to this report.","NEW: 70% of ministerial posts filled, interim prime minister says, state media reports .

"London (CNN) -- Malala Yousufzai, the Pakistani teenager who defied Taliban attackers to promote education for girls, says she's ""feeling all right"" after two weekend surgeries. Doctors attached a titanium plate to her skull and implanted a cochlear device to restore hearing to her left ear. Read more: The girl the Taliban wanted dead . ""I'm happy that both of the operations are successful,"" she said Monday from her bed at a Birmingham hospital. ""I can walk a little bit and I'm feeling better."" She hopes to be fully recovered in about a month, she said. Malala ""has no long-lasting brain injuries"" after being shot in the head by Taliban gunmen last October, her brain surgeon, Dr. Anwen White, said Monday. Read more: Malala's journey from near death to recovery . ""She won't need any further surgery,"" White said. The five-hour operation took place Sunday at a Birmingham hospital. After surgeons attached the titanium plate and inserted the implant, the 15-year-old Malala was ""very focused and enthusiastic,"" White said. Shortly after the shooting, Malala's brain swelled dangerously, so doctors in Pakistan extracted a section of her skull about the size of a hand. Otherwise, the pressure in her cranium would have caused severe brain damage, likely killing her. Doctors then temporarily implanted the skull piece in her abdomen -- a common procedure to preserve bone fragments for later use. The skull piece would have no longer fit properly without the addition of some titanium parts, as her head and the bone fragment have changed. Titanium also has a low incidence of infection and can be handcrafted to near perfection, doctors said. Pakistan's Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . On Saturday, before the surgery, Malala credited her survival to ""the prayers of the people.""

""She's already talking about furthering her cause,"" said the hospital's medical director, Dr. Dave Rosser. The terrorists have said they will target her again. Malala had become deaf when gunfire from the attack broke the delicate bones that help turn sound into sensory impulses to the brain. The cochlear device will not allow her to hear completely naturally, Rosser said. But it will restore enough function to the damaged ear to allow her to hear things such as an approaching car, which obviously is important for safety.","Malala Yousufzai says she's feeling all right after double surgeries in the UK .

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- More than 300 inmates were killed in a prison fire in central Honduras, officials said Wednesday, as families clamored to learn whether their loved ones were among the victims. The fire was one of the worst tragedies of its kind in decades in Latin America and focused renewed attention on the often poor conditions of prisons in the region. Authorities offered differing reports of how many prisoners died in the fire. Honduran government officials said more than 300 inmates were killed, while the National Human Rights Commission said as many as 356 inmates were unaccounted for and may have died. Forensic teams removed more than 150 bodies from the facility by Wednesday evening. ""Everyone ran for their lives,"" said one survivor who spoke briefly to local television cameras. Watch an iReport of the fire . Prisoners awakened to the screams of fellow inmates and forced themselves out of the prison any way they could, he said. Authorities were investigating what caused the blaze, which broke out late Tuesday in a minimum-security prison in Comayagua, Honduras, about 40 miles northwest of the capital, Tegucigalpa. About 200 meters away from the prison, Carlos Alfredo Garcia Zepeda said he was inside his home when he heard a series of blasts, like a bomb. ""I didn't pay much attention, because we have a lot of fireworks,"" he said. ""Then I heard them screaming. ... I went outside and couldn't believe what I was seeing."" As bright orange flames and thick plumes of smoke filled the night air, the 21-year-old recorded a video of what he saw, which he submitted to CNN's iReport. Gunshots rang out. The flames raged for about an hour, he said, but a few minutes after he started recording, the cries for help stopped. ""It's an outrage. It happened so quickly. I guess they couldn't do anything anymore,"" he said. As word of the fire spread, Honduran officials pledged to take swift action to determine what caused it. ""This is a day of deep pain for Honduras,"" Honduran President Porfirio Lobo said in an address to the nation Wednesday. He announced the suspension of the Comayagua prison administrators and the entire prison chain of command up to the national level. ""We are going to review the conditions in all the penitentiary centers to see how we can improve the overcrowding conditions that exist in many of our prisons,"" Lobo said. The prison was built to house 250 inmates, but 852 inmates were behind bars there at the time of the fire, the Honduran National Human Rights Commission said in a statement. Five of the prison's units -- more than half of the facility -- were affected by the fire, said Jose Turcios, a spokesman for the Comayagua fire department. The country's prison commissioner said authorities were looking into whether a short circuit sparked the fire or if a prisoner set a mattress alight. Authorities have not determined what caused the fire, but the nation's electric utility will review wiring in all prison facilities as a ""preventative measure,"" Lobo said, ""because that can be one of the causes of these types of disasters."" Before dawn Wednesday, families of the prisoners gathered in front of the prison gates and authorities' offices, demanding to know if their loved ones were among the survivors. Hundreds of relatives pressed against the gates as an official read aloud the survivors' names. ""I understand the worry and demands of the people, but we have to abide by the law,"" said Pompeyo Bonilla, the country's minister of security. ""We have the best intention to give answers to the families as soon as possible."" The president said Chile was sending forensics experts to Honduras to help with identification. It was the third fatal prison fire in recent years. In 2003, 61 prisoners were killed in a fire at a prison in La Ceiba. In 2004, 107 died in a fire at a San Pedro Sula prison. The U.S. State Department published a report last April painting a damning portrait of conditions in Honduras' 24 prisons. Prisoners ""suffered from severe overcrowding, malnutrition, and lack of adequate sanitation,"" the report said, citing human rights groups. ""Authorities did not provide adequate food or other basic necessities. The ready access of prisoners to weapons and other contraband, impunity for inmate attacks on nonviolent prisoners, inmate escapes, and inmate threats against prison officials and their families contributed to an unstable and dangerous penitentiary system environment,"" the department said in its 2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. Human rights groups also alleged that prison officials used excessive force against prisoners, the State Department said. As of December 2010, the total prison population in the country was just under 12,000, about 400 of whom were women, the report said. Honduran officials told CNN that overcrowding in the country's prisons is the result of an increase in transnational organized crime. Honduras, and the world, will have to decide how to respond to the security crisis in the poor nation, Foreign Minister Arturo Corrales said. ""We do not produce drugs, nor are we the main place where they are consumed. But we suffer from the scourge of the extreme increase in violence in our country because of drug trafficking,"" he said. Danilo Orellana, the director of prisons in Honduras, added that the prisons in general were in crisis. ""The situation is grave, and we have said on many occasions that the prisons in the country are failing and that investments are necessary from the state,"" he said. Mariano Castillo reported from Atlanta and Elvin Sandoval from Tegucigalpa. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark in London and Rafael Romo and Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: Witness: ""I went outside and couldn't believe what I was seeing""

"(CNN) -- Revolutions devour their young. That lesson became well-known after the French Revolution, and it has proven itself true many times since then. Now the Arab Spring -- whose very name summed up the idealistic, democratic expectations of the activists that launched it and the optimistic reception their movement engendered around the world -- looks like it may well join the long list of popular uprisings that failed disastrously to meet those aspirations. It has turned out that mass movements would not swiftly sweep away entrenched dictators and replace them with pluralistic democratic rule. In Tunisia, where a street vendor set himself on fire in December 2010, igniting the region, someone has been assassinating liberal politicians, raising tensions between the Islamist-dominated government and an increasingly restless opposition. In Syria, what started as a peaceful uprising against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad has turned to civil war. More than 100,000 Syrians are dead. Millions more have fled, further destabilizing a fragile region. Al-Assad, with the support of Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, has stopped the opposition's momentum. The democratic movement has been invaded by radical Islamists, including al Qaeda loyalists. The country is falling apart and could well end up as a failed state, run by warlords and split along sectarian lines. There are serious troubles also in Libya, and few if any signs of democratic progress anywhere else, not in Bahrain, Jordan or Saudi Arabia. Is the Arab Spring over? Is there any hope for the people of the Arab Middle East to enjoy true democracy, equality, respect for human rights, freedom of the press and of religion? All eyes are now on Egypt, the Arab world's most important country, a state whose political example has proven a regional trendsetter over many decades. As in the other struggling Arab Spring nations, democracy here has also found toxic soil. But the cause is not hopeless. Despite the setbacks for revolution, something has changed in the region, and it is in Egypt where the movement will live or die. It was in Cairo's Tahrir Square where liberal groups launched their movement for democracy, only to see their vision hijacked by the Muslim Brotherhood. And it is in Egypt where last month they made a push to save their revolution from Islamists, only to be outplayed yet again, this time by the military and its leader, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The highly disciplined Brotherhood won the first wave of democratic elections, but its intentions differed sharply from those of the Tahrir protesters. President Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected president, set on a course to give his Muslim Brotherhood steadily expanding control of the country. The Brotherhood repeatedly broke promises and started to create a country dominated by its loyalists, firing critical newspaper editors, blocking opposing views from the writing of the new constitution, naming Brotherhood members as provincial governors, allowing laws and practices that were disastrous, even deadly, for Christians, Shiites and women. Making matters much worse, the economy started spiraling down, creating enormous hardships for the Egyptian people. Then the Tamarod (rebellion) movement gathered millions of signatures calling for the president's resignation and new elections. On June 30, millions of Egyptians took to the streets. Within hours, the military put an end to the Muslim Brotherhood rule. Morsy has been held in an disclosed location since then, but the European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, met with him for two hours Monday. Egyptians by the millions are exhilarated by the end of the Muslim Brotherhood experiment, intoxicated with gratitude to the military, grateful for removing the president. Al-Sisi's profile is rising. He's clearly in command and exploiting the popular adulation. But is this what the Arab Spring was supposed to do, replace an unelected dictator with a general and his hand-picked prime minister? In a highly suspicious move, al-Sisi called for a mass demonstration in support of the military on Friday, summoning his backers to the streets, even as thousands of Morsy supporters continued a sit-in outside a mosque. On the day of the protest, as if to provoke the Islamists to confrontation, Morsy was charged with murder and espionage. With the strong show of popular support, security forces took on the Islamists. In the clashes, which have been replicated in other cities, scores of Brotherhood supporters have been killed. Liberal Egyptians are getting worried. Al-Sisi's own words should be cause for concern. He has defended the military's outrageous ""virginity tests"" on female activists as a way to ""protect the girls from rape."" The military has promised a return to democracy next year, but al-Sisi has written about the need to introduce another version of Islamist rule to Egypt. Authorities are reviving Mubarak-era institutions of repression amid an atmosphere of swelling nationalism and adulation for the military. This is a steep, seemingly impossible, challenge for liberals. The military saved them, but it could easily bury them. What they have in their favor is that the Arab Spring introduced the concept of democratic legitimacy into Egypt. A government that strays too visibly, for too long, will ultimately face the wrath of the people. What activists should do, and the world should help them do, is stress the fundamental values of liberal democracy and publicly demand that the military affirm its own acceptance of those values -- which the Brotherhood was criticized for violating -- including freedom of thought, freedom of the press and equal rights under the law for all. The killing of Muslim Brotherhood supporters is a shameful violation of those principles. Egypt needs to develop democratic institutions, political tolerance, real political parties and politically educated citizens. It's a tall order. But it's the only way to keep the revolution from devouring the ideals on which it was launched. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","It's long been known that revolutions devour their young, Frida Ghitis says .

"(CNN) -- When I was young, one of my best friends lived in my grandmother's village. I saw Chrissie every weekend as we made our way through childhood -- she in the village school and I in the town school. We finally came together as students in secondary school. Sadly, Chrissie studied with me for only one term, as her parents could not afford the school fee of $6. She returned to her village, married early and had more than a half-dozen children. She lives there still, locked in poverty. My parents, on the other hand, could afford the school fees, and I was lucky enough to finish my schooling and eventually to run a successful business. Now, I am president of Malawi. On Wednesday, I take the floor of the U.N. General Assembly as the second female president of an African country, and one of about 14 in the world, I am honored to bring my message of hope for Malawi and for Africa to the world. When I travel through my country and talk to the people, I see myself and Chrissie in the children I meet, who are bursting with intelligence and creativity and joy. But when I take the stage at the United Nations to represent my country, I also represent the parents of Malawi's children, the women who fear the dangers of giving birth and the men who search desperately to find work to pay for their families' basic needs. The bad news about Malawi is not news to anyone. About 85% of Malawians live in rural villages in extreme poverty; AIDS and malaria are rampant. A single crop failure can ruin so many. These development challenges are intertwined in the lives of Malawians, and we must fight for progress on many fronts if we are to lift my country from poverty. The journeys of women in my country -- and in countries all over the developing world -- are never easy. The health of our women in particular is central to many of our development challenges, and is an issue to which I have been devoted since I almost lost my life delivering my fourth child. It was only because I was fortunate enough to have access to a specialist in a hospital that I am alive today. Last year, I visited a hospital where a baby had just died. Born in the dark of night with no electricity, that child had the cord wrapped around her neck and no one had seen it. In clinics I see women waiting to give birth on the floors of the corridors because there is no other place. When I took office, I launched the Presidential Initiative for Maternal Health and Safe Motherhood, a project that I hope will reverse the poor access to reproductive health services for women in my country. Our girls, 15- and 16-year-olds, are having children themselves; they should be going to school, and we must support them and provide them with family planning education. When we empower women with education and access to reproductive health services, we can lift an entire nation. Women who can choose when to have children and how many they will have are more likely to complete their education, start small businesses and participate actively in society. And as I witnessed with my friend Chrissie, education itself is vital to give women that choice in the first place. This is why efforts to improve the lives of women and children reinforce efforts to strengthen our economy and reduce poverty. After the speeches of the world leaders are over, the U.N. General Assembly will come together to determine how it will tackle poverty and set benchmarks to measure progress in economic development. I will do everything I can to make sure that women's reproductive health remains a central focus. We cannot afford to squander the potential of girls such as Chrissie any longer.

"(CNN) -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday visited Malala Yousufzai -- a 15-year-old schoolgirl and girls' education advocate who was targeted by Taliban militants in Pakistan's restive Swat Valley. Yousufzai is currently being treated in the United Kingdom at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, after she was shot in the head by gunmen in October in retaliation for her advocacy. Zardari went ""to see for himself the health condition ... and also to pay tributes to her for her courage and steadfastness,"" his office said in a written statement. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, though may not have anticipated the level of condemnation the attack would provoke as outcry spread across Pakistan's political spectrum. Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban redoubt in northwest Pakistan near neighboring Afghanistan. On her blog, the schoolmaster's daughter wrote about her life in the region, a center of militant activity where girls' schools were shuttered and strict Islamist rules imposed. In her writings, which earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, Malala encouraged young people to resist the Taliban, and was later featured in two documentaries.","Malala Yousufzai is being treated in the United Kingdom at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital .

"(CNN) -- The fight against sexism has suddenly become all the rage among politicians. How curious. How timely. How suspiciously convenient. It took one politician, a woman, to put it all in perspective. If you have not heard the speech from Prime Minister Julia Gillard on the floor of the Australian House of Representatives, do yourself a favor. This is one for the ages. Nobody has unmasked political hypocrisy with such fire, with such passion, in a long, long time. We have heard the poll-tested, calculated claims by politicians around the globe. We hear it in presidential debates in the United States, where the election may depend on the support of female voters, and we've heard it in places like Pakistan, where politicians want to benefit from the outrage over the shooting of 14-year-old Malala Yousufzai after assassins tried to kill her for defending every girl's right to an education. In Australia, the political battle revolved around a very unique, rather strange, set of circumstances. But Gillard's words crystallized the source of the unease that hangs over so many people as they hear politicians courting them. How much can we believe what they say? Much became clear after the speech in Canberra, when Gillard unloaded a sizzling rhetorical barrage on Tony Abbott, the leader of the opposition, who had presented a motion he claimed was motivated by his own support of women's equality. Gillard would have none of it. ""I will not be lectured about misogyny by this man. I will not. Not now, not ever,"" she intoned, pointing directly at Abbott, who sat in his chair trying to keep a plastic smile on his face, no doubt hoping it would all end soon. But Gillard was just getting started. The Australian prime minister, glancing only occasionally at a sheet of notes, eviscerated her opponent's claim that he had a sincere interest in standing up for women. You could detect a brief wince of anguish in Abbott's tense brow when Gillard suggested ""Let's go through the opposition leader's repulsive double standards."" She went on to list, one by one, instances that demonstrate a track record of disdain for women by the opposition leader. Abbott was claiming to be offended by crude, sexist text messages, sent by the speaker of the House, who happened to be a supporter of the prime minister. The speaker eventually resigned his position. But Gillard, to the consternation of some Australians, would not support Abbott's motion to fire him. If Abbott thinks misogynists are not suited for high office, she said, he should take a piece of paper and write out his resignation. ""If he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives,"" Gillard charged, ""he needs a mirror."" Checkmate. Gillard's now-famous ""Misogyny Speech"" became such a worldwide hit that publishing house Macquarie decided to update its definition of ""misogyny."" The old definition is ""hatred of women."" Macquarie said it will add a new meaning, ""entrenched prejudice against women,"" reflecting the word's modern usage. The speech became a hit because of its raw eloquence and visceral emotion. But it would not have ignited a fast-spreading fire if it had not touched flammable material. Gillard's words resonated because we have all heard hypocritical politicians make claims that have the tinny ring of untruth, an echo of political consultant and focus-group regurgitation. The phenomenon becomes more prevalent, not surprisingly, when elections approach. In Pakistan, for example, the country is preparing to hold elections this year. The attempt to kill Malala by the supremely misogynistic Pakistani Taliban came just in time for politicians to try to fuel their campaigns with popular sentiment. The populist Imran Khan, a former cricket superstar who has entered politics, rushed to Malala's bedside and was quick to condemn the attempted murder, as were many politicians. But, like many others, he refused to blame the Taliban, even though the group openly admitted to the hit and vowed to try again to kill her, reaffirming its revolting anti-women ideology. A closer look at Khan's views, despite his show of support for Malala, indicates that he is unlikely to challenge the Taliban, even if that means sacrificing women's rights. In the U.S., the last presidential debate came just after a Gallup poll showed Republican Mitt Romney tying President Obama in likely swing state votes from women. Obama had relied on an advantage with women to stay ahead in the polls. Not surprisingly, the two men came out prepared for a full-on joust for the women's vote. By one count, the two mentioned women 30 times in the last debate, with Obama wrapping himself in his support for equal pay legislation and Romney making his much-maligned claim to have relied on ""binders full of women"" to find qualified candidates for high office while he was governor of Massachusetts. Cardona: Romney's empty 'binders full of women' I am not arguing that the ""binders"" are a fantasy, nor am I saying that Obama or Romney are sexist. What I do say is that, increasingly, what we hear from politicians is carefully calculated. It is not calculated for accuracy; it is calibrated for effect. That means women, and those who want to see the realization of a vision of equality, of an end to sexism and misogyny, need to consume the words of politicians with a large serving of skepticism. Every claim, every promise, must be checked against a track record to find whether it's true and whether it is a good predictor of what they would do after the election, when standing up for women's rights may not prove as timely and convenient as it does today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Fiery speech by Australia's leader slams a politician's newly found support of women .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani teenage activist shot in the head by the Taliban for demanding an education has left her beloved country for specialized medical treatment in Britain. The Taliban's attempted assassination last week of Malala Yousufzai, 14, has sparked outrage inside Pakistan and around the world, transforming the young blogger into an international symbol of defiance against the radical Islamist group that continues to wield influence in parts of Pakistan. After Tuesday's attack, Malala was treated immediately by Pakistani doctors who later removed a bullet lodged in her neck. She was airlifted Monday to a hospital in Birmingham, England, that treats the country's war casualties. There she will be treated by neurosurgery specialists. Her recovery could take months, doctors said. Authorities in Pakistan said they are moving forward with their investigation into the attack. The country's interior minister, Rehman Malik, offered a $1 million bounty Monday for Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan. Most Pakistanis consider the Taliban murderous ideologues, and the young girl's willingness to risk her life to attend school -- despite the Taliban's opposition to education for girls-- has struck a nerve. Read a profile of Malala Yousufzai . One of the largest rallies supporting Malala took place Sunday in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, where men, women and their children held signs that said, ""Shame on you, Taliban."" Others held signs condemning terrorism. Massive posters and billboards said, ""Malala, our prayers are with you."" At another rally in the capital of Islamabad, protesters held candles and prayed for the girl's recovery. iReport: Your views on girls' education . Malala began gaining international attention in 2009 as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region of Swat, a Taliban-heavy valley in northwest Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. Malala's father operated one of the few schools that defied the Taliban by keeping its doors open to girls. At 11 years old, Malala started writing a blog for the BBC about what it was like to try to get an education under the constant threat of death by Islamist extremists. Her touching diary earned her both national and international praise. ""I had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taleban,"" she wrote. ""I have had such dreams since the launch of the military operation in Swat. My mother made me breakfast and I went off to school. I was afraid going to school because the Taleban had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools."" Millions of children face Malala's fight for an education . Now, Malala's supporters are demanding the government thoroughly investigate who stopped a van carrying Malala and her classmates, as they returned from school in the Swat Valley last Tuesday. Gunmen jumped inside the van and ordered students to point out Malala. Horrified, they did. The men began shooting, hitting Malala in the head and neck. Two other girls were also wounded. In recent days, as Malala breathed with the help of a ventilator in Pakistani medical facilities, the Taliban trumpeted its responsibility for the shooting. They vowed that if she survives, they'll come after her again, and next time finish her. 'I am Malala' Malala's story of defiance and survival has triggered an online flurry of petitions and support pages rallying for Malala and her fight for girls' education. An online ""I Am Malala"" petition, signed by celebrities and leaders, is demanding that girls get better access to education. The petition will be presented to Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Another online petition telling authorities to arrest Malala's attackers and end ties between the government and extremists had more than 10,000 signatures by mid-day Monday. ""All our law enforcers, intelligence agencies are hunting all those who were involved. I have got some other names which I would not like to mention on record because it may damage the investigation. But let me (as)sure my Pakistani nation, and the entire world, that we will get them very soon,"" Interior Minister Malik told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. He said the attack plan was hatched in Afghanistan, and vowed to hold those responsible to account ""very soon."" Attack galvanises anti-Taliban feeling . ""Four people came from there. ... One of the guys, we have identified and (a) few of his associates have been arrested. One of -- the fiancee of one of the terrorists has been detained, and all possible leads which we have developed ... we are following it,"" the minister said, adding that the government has provided security to Malala's family and to two girls who were wounded in the same attack. The name ""Malala"" has been trending on Twitter and has mobilized a large following on Facebook. She also has attracted the attention of international leaders, including former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who wrote in a CNN commentary that the attack on Malala highlights the plight of ""61 million young children like Malala who will not go to school today or any other day."" And, last week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioned Malala's bravery at a gathering of Girl Scouts in Washington. She said the attack on the teen should inspire support for other young women around the world who ""struggle against tradition and culture and even outright hostility,"" to lay claim to their rights. Even Madonna shouted Malala's name at a Los Angeles concert last week to the wild applause of fans and dedicated her hit ""Human Nature"" to the girl. In Pakistan, young girls are wearing ""I am Malala"" T-shirts to show their solidarity with the teen activist. Attack on teen blogger consumes Pakistan . Malala is expected to be hospitalized for ""weeks if not months,"" said David Rosser, executive medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham. Rosser declined to discuss details of Malala's condition, but said the decision to fly her to the United Kingdom from Pakistan was a sign that her medical team hopes she will pull through. ""They wouldn't be going through all this, if there wasn't a good hope of recovery,"" he said. When Malala was rushed to a hospital in the northwestern city of Peshawar after she was shot, doctors tried to reduce swelling in her brain and removed the bullet in her neck. She was later transferred to a military hospital in Rawalpindi outside Islamabad. At Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, she will need to have the damaged bones in her skull repaired or replaced as well as intensive neurological rehabilitation, the Pakistani military said Monday. Malala's family has been kept up on every step of her treatment, officials say. On Amanpour: The Malalas you'll never meet . ""Malala will now receive specialist medical care in an NHS hospital,"" said British Foreign Secretary William Hague, referring to the country's National Health Service. ""Our thoughts remain with Malala and her family at this difficult time."" 'I have the right' Malala spoke to CNN last year about her blog and her brave assertion that girls should go to school. ""I have the right of education,"" she said. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Opinion: One girl's courage in the face of Taliban cowardice . Her writing earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize and encouraged young people to take a stand against the Taliban -- and to not hide in their bedrooms. But the instability of the region was highlighted late Sunday in an attack by scores of militants on a police outpost that killed six officers, police said. On her blog, Malala often wrote about her life in Swat Valley, a hotbed of militant activity. The valley once attracted tourists to Pakistan's only ski resort, as well as visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. But that was before militants -- their faces covered -- unleashed a wave of violence in 2003. They demanded veils for women, beards for men and a ban on music and television. They allowed boys' schools to operate but closed those for girls. Learn more about how you can help at CNN Impact Your World .

"(CNN) -- They spend their days beside a dusty freeway scratching a living by selling an unusual roadside snack to passing motorists: barbecued mice on sticks. But when no cars are in sight and the trade in mice kebabs is slow, this group of childhood friends bring out their rudimentary guitars and put on an impromptu performance. And that's how Ian Brennan, the American Grammy-winning producer famous for his work with nomadic rockers Tinariwen, came to unearth his latest music gem: the Malawi Mouse Boys. Two years ago, Brennan embarked on a mission to discover hidden musical talent in Malawi, just as he'd done before with many other bands. However, after more than two weeks and over 2,000 kilometers of fruitless driving along bumpy tracks, Brennan had found nothing. But his luck changed one evening when he spotted a young man strumming his battered guitar by a two-lane highway in rural Malawi. Not thinking twice, the producer immediately did a u-turn, went up to the young man, named Alfred, and asked him to play a song. What followed was a glorious moment, bathed in the flaming colors of the setting sun casting a soft orange glow in the evening air. ""It will stay with me forever,"" recalls Brennan. ""The sun was going down and a group of around 20 children, ranging from toddlers to teenagers, had gathered around. Alfred was so shy, the song was nearly inaudible. But when he hit the chorus, all of the kids joined in -- it was true surround sound. ""I realized that I had stumbled on a micro hit, isolated on this one corner of this one stretch of road."" Songs of love and faith . That ""micro hit"" ended up on ""He is #1,"" the debut offering from the Malawi Mouse released last year. The album, a joyous collection of 14 self-penned gospel songs combining uplifting harmonies with rhythmic guitar playing, was recorded entirely outdoors in just two days using Brennan's portable studio. Read this: 10 must-see African films . But minus a few unexpected intrusions -- tiny spiders kept causing problems by finding their way into Brennan's hard-drive -- recording on the clay ground next to the band members' huts allowed the honesty and soulfulness of the performance to shine through, as well as a few unusual contributions from passing animals and local children. ""In those situations that are outdoors there's always variables,"" explains Brennan. ""Wind is always going to be present; in this case children and animals were on the recording but sometimes the children and the animals contribute -- they tend to be very on time."" But while their songs have been described as echoing ""mid-20th century American gospel music,"" the Malawi Mouse Boys had never even heard recordings in that genre. ""There are a lot of parallel things on, but it's not that they are influenced by American music,"" says Brennan. ""It's quite different to that; they're playing the very music that were contributing factors or maybe even the source of American music."" Tough existence . Malawi, a beautiful landlocked country in southern Africa, is one of the world's poorest nations, ranking 170 out of 187 countries surveyed at the Human Development Index. Living without electricity in a tiny village near the town of Balaka, the Malawi Mouse Boys have defied adversity by making music together since they were children. Completely self taught, they write their jubilant songs on homemade instruments -- from four-string guitars crafted from scrap metal to makeshift tin-can drums. Read this: Somali rappers defy bullets . But to make ends meet, they rely on standing by the highway almost around the clock trying to tempt travelers to buy their roasted mice. ""It's a very dangerous work,"" says Brennan. ""They're hunting the mice themselves; they clean them and then they boil them and grill them. They do all this work and maybe they will end up with one stick which will sell for the equivalent of somewhere between half a euro or a euro. It's quite a tough existence."" Giving voice to the unheard . ""He is #1"" marked the first time an album had been released internationally in the language of Chichewa, a fact Brennan describes as ""unjust"" and ""absurd"" and ""mirroring society's greater inequities."" ""How can it be just that tens of thousands of 'artists' from cities like Los Angeles and London are given platforms, but entire countries are left voiceless globally?"" he asks. ""When we listen to people sing in another language, we are forced to listen to what they mean rather than what they say. And when we listen to each other, there is a chance for understanding and empathy to grow."" Remarkable to see . Late last month, the band broke new ground with their first-ever performance outside Malawi, when they brought their authentic sounds to the world-renowned Womad Festival in the UK. The band's uplifting set, performed on their DIY instruments, was one of the festival's major highlights. ""It was remarkable to see,"" says Brennan. ""Having never even been on a stage before, never sung with amplified microphones before, to going all the way to really putting on a show,"" he adds. ""To see them perform it's quite a unique thing."" Brennan says the band's success stems from their level of commitment and a lack of self-consciousness, a rare quality in today's entertainment industry. ""We're so used to seeing people that are hyper conscious about how they appear and often times their volitions are filtered through a myriad of media influences that they have absorbed,"" he says. ""This is a very different thing; this is something that's more akin probably to music before the advent of television,"" he adds. Brennan says the band has already recorded its second album, which it is planning to release next year. He also says that he hopes to help them tour overseas again. But while he was very keen on hearing the band's music, Brennan was much more reluctant to sample a taste of their other line of work. ""I am a vegetarian,"" he says, when asked if he'd tried the mice kebabs. ""I have the perfect excuse.""","Malawi Mouse Boys is an eight-member gospel band .

"(CNN) -- Scientists said Wednesday that they had discovered a new particle whose characteristics match those of the Higgs boson, the most sought-after particle in physics, which could help unlock some of the universe's deepest secrets. ""We have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature,"" said Rolf Heuer, the director general of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which has been carrying out experiments in search of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest particle accelerator. ""The discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe,"" Heuer said. The particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist Leon Lederman reportedly wanted to call his book ""The Goddamn Particle."" But he truncated that epithet to ""The God Particle,"" which may have helped elevate the particle's allure in popular culture. More: Why the 'God Particle' may be key to universe . Announcements by scientists about their analysis of data generated by trillions of particle collisions in the LHC, which is located beneath the Alps, drew avid applause at an eagerly awaited seminar in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday. Finding the Higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass, one of the open questions in physicists' current understanding of the way the universe works. The researchers stressed the preliminary nature of the results they were announcing Wednesday. ""A more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the LHC provides the experiments with more data,"" the nuclear research organization, known as CERN, said in its statement. But despite the words of caution, the scientists' mood and many of their comments were brimming with enthusiasm about the potential scope of what they had discovered. ""It's hard not to get excited by these results,"" said Sergio Bertolucci, the research director at CERN. The announcements by the CERN researchers come two days after scientists in Illinois said they had crept closer to proving the existence of the Higgs boson but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion. The U.S.-based scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year. Fabiola Gianotti: The woman at the leading edge of physics . They passed the baton onto their counterparts using the LHC, which is much more powerful than the Tevatron. Located 328 feet underneath the border of France and Switzerland, the LHC cost $10 billion and has been sending particles smashing together in 17-mile tunnel for the past 18 months. High speed proton collisions generate a range of even smaller particles that scientists have been sifting through in search of a signal in the data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. The elusive particle is part of a theory first proposed by physicist Peter Higgs and others in the 1960s to explain how particles obtain mass. Higgs boson is like... a Justin Bieber fan? The theory proposes that a so-called Higgs energy field exists everywhere in the universe. As particles zoom around in this field, they interact with and attract Higgs bosons, which cluster around the particles in varying numbers. Imagine the universe like a party. Relatively unknown guests at the party can pass quickly through the room unnoticed; more popular guests will attract groups of people (the Higgs bosons) who will then slow their movement through the room. The speed of particles moving through the Higgs field works much in the same way. Certain particles will attract larger clusters of Higgs bosons -- and the more Higgs bosons a particle attracts, the greater its mass will be. While finding the Higgs boson won't tell us everything we need to know about how the universe works, it will fill in a huge hole in the Standard Model that has existed for more than 50 years, according to experts. ""The Higgs boson is the last missing piece of our current understanding of the most fundamental nature of the universe,"" Martin Archer, a physicist at Imperial College in London, told CNN.

"(CNN) -- The father of Malala Yousafzai, the teenager whom the Taliban tried to kill, has been given a job in a Pakistan consulate in Birmingham, England, where she is recovering from gunshot wounds to her head and neck, Pakistani officials said Wednesday. Ziauddin Yousafzai has been appointed education attache and will function as head of the consulate's education section for three years, the Pakistani government said. His job could be extended two additional years. At the time of his daughter's shooting, Ziauddin Yousafzai ran a school in Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls -- in defiance of the Taliban. The Taliban forbid girls in the classroom and have threatened to kill anyone who defies them. Malala was shot by gunmen last fall for her crusade about girls going to school. She had blogged fearlessly about girls' education and accused the Taliban of thriving on ignorance. Her father's employment fulfills a pledge by Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, who visited Malala in December and assured her father that the government would meet ""all expenses of Malala's treatment and all the needs of the family while in UK,"" a government statement said Wednesday. ""In light of that, the present appointment has been made,"" the statement said. On October 9, Malala was on a school van in Swat Valley when Taliban gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them who was Malala. They identified her. Malala was then shot, as were two other girls who survived the attack. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" a Taliban spokesman said after the shooting. He vowed to come after her if she managed to live. Islamic militants also threatened to kill journalists covering her story. Since her shooting, Malala has become an international figure. She was selected as runner-up for Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2012. CNN and Time are owned by Time Warner Inc. Malala arrived at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham on October 16. A bullet that hit her left brow didn't penetrate the skull but traveled the side of her head under the skin and into her neck, the hospital said. The shock wave shattered the thinnest bone of her skull, and fragments entered her brain, the hospital said. The teen had been in critical condition, but doctors removed the bullet and she has no major brain or nerve damage. Physicians said she will need reconstructive surgery. Malala is walking, writing and reading again. The Islamic militants behind the Taliban continue to repress women in northwest Pakistan. Last month, Malala asked a graduate school not to name its institution after her. Girls were afraid that attending the Malala Yousafzai Post Graduate College for Women in the Taliban-dominated Swat Valley would attract the attention of fighters such as the ones who shot Malala and the two other girls, said Kamran Rehman Khan, a top official in the Swat Valley. The Saidu Sharif Post Graduate School briefly changed its name to recognize Malala's brave campaign for girls' education in Pakistan. Several students told Khan that they respect Malala but were concerned about their safety, he said. Khan told CNN that Malala called him last month from her hospital room in England and asked the school to remove her name. But she wished for people to continue to fight for girls to go to school, he said. ""I was so impressed that despite having threats against her life, she was talking about girls' education in the region and against militants,"" Khan said.

"London (CNN) -- It's hard to believe that this area of east London was once a dilapidated and neglected quarter of the UK capital. With shiny new stadiums and visitor facilities nestling among the lush landscaped grounds, every detail of the 500-acre Olympic Park has taken into account environmental concerns, prompting 2012 organizers to bill it as the first sustainable Olympics. David Stubbs, head of sustainability for the London 2012 Games, was part of the original team that drafted London's successful bid. Sustainability was a key reason why London was chosen, he says, and provides a golden opportunity to show what can be achieved. ""If you can put sustainability at the heart of a project which is the largest logistical exercise in peace time -- across 26 different sports, with thousands of people attending and millions watching -- then you can do it anywhere,"" Stubbs said. See more: CNN's Aiming for Gold . Many of the park's bridges have been constructed using gabion walls (steel mesh filled with stones and rubble) providing a visual reminder of the Games' green goals. ""There's a huge emphasis on reuse and recycling,"" says Stubbs. ""All the buildings that were knocked down, all that rubble was sort of crushed up and used as the fillings of these gabions for the new bridges."" The River Lea and several canals which wend their way through the park used to be badly polluted, he says. Today, after an intensive program of clearing and widening, wildlife is being encouraged to return. Watch: London's new ""Green Park"" ""Creating a shallower profile in the wetlands further up (the river) has allowed larger areas of wildlife habitat to be created. At the same time that's providing flood mitigation benefits to thousands of properties in the local area,"" Stubbs says. In addition to over 300,000 wetland plants, organizers have planted more than 4,000 trees and 130,000 plants and bulbs. ""One of the key things about this site is how you've got natural park lands as well as more formal gardens. Unlike previous games people are going to really feel they are in a park,"" Stubbs said. London 2012 organizers are also proud of the park's sporting arenas built for the Games. Behind the velodrome's timber-clad frame, cyclists will race for gold round a track made from sustainably-sourced Siberian pine, while Zaha Hadid's striking wave-shaped roof on the Aquatics Center has been temporarily adorned with ""wings"" providing seating for 15,000 spectators. ""That's great for the games, but after we'll bring it down to 2,500 seats for legacy mode, as it turns into a facility for the local community,"" he said. Temporary seating and venues, like the 12,000-seat Basketball Arena, will accommodate nearly 300,000 spectators during the games -- a figure without precedent at any previous Olympics, according to organizers. All eyes will be on the Olympic Stadium come the opening ceremony on July 27 with the 80,000-seat arena being the sustainable centerpiece of the Games. Constructed using just a tenth of the steel required to build Beijing's ""Bird's Nest"", the stadium weighs in at just 4,500 tons, becoming the lightest Olympic Stadium ever built. Parts of the tubular steel roof has been built using surplus gas pipelines, Stubbs says. He and his team have used recycled materials wherever possible, which is not only cheaper but also cuts carbon emissions and energy costs. The complexities of the addressing sustainability have been a constant challenge Stubbs says, but his efforts appear to have paid off. London 2012 ""can build the confidence to wider society that sustainability is not a theory but infinitely do-able,"" said executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, Achim Steiner during a visit in April this year. ""Thrilled"" at the results he and his team have managed to produce, Stubbs is hopeful the park will be attracting visitors long after the Olympics has left town. ""It's not about two weeks ... It is what this site will be like 20 to 30 years down the road,"" Stubbs said.","London 2012 organizers have placed sustainability at the heart of their planning for the Summer Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . First of all I have to say: Congratulations! We have all come a long way from once being mistakenly called the inferior sex. I remember the first time I read Aristotle's view that a female is an incomplete male, ""or as it were, a deformity."" I was really offended and furious. The first thing that popped in my mind was, ""We have to prove all our detractors wrong."" But we definitely can't do that with 60 million of our girls out of school! So yes, we have come a long way, but we are still not there yet. A wise friend recently told me: No child in the developing world has died directly due to the lack of education. They die due to illness, during childbirth, due to violence, poverty, etc. -- which is probably why the world hasn't yet understood the gravity of having more than 100 million children not in primary school, of which 60 million are girls. If you really think hard, you will realize that the way to end the cycle of poverty, reduce the number of teenage pregnancies and early marriage and many other ills that befall our girls is through education. An educated girl will marry later, will have fewer and healthier children, will educate her daughters and without a doubt her sons, will be self-sufficient and, most importantly, will have a voice. She will not only dream but also realize her dreams of becoming whoever she wants to be. I am writing this letter to all of you girls, but especially appealing to those who have had the privilege of going to school. We need to use our educated voices to raise awareness in our families, communities, countries and the world and say we cannot and will not ignore our sisters anymore. They have the same rights as we do, and there can be no discrimination. We can and must hold our governments accountable and ask them to give us the answers and results we deserve. I am also writing this letter to all the boys -- fathers, brothers and husbands, friends who have supported us. I am grateful that you see us as just as important to the human race as our male counterparts. Your support and belief in us keeps us encouraged to keep powering on. Please keep it coming and please spread the word. Finally, I write to those we want to affect with our voices positively: You have the right to an education. You have the right to grow up healthy, in safety, and with equal access to opportunity. I, and millions of your supporters across the globe, stand with you in the pursuit of equality. Change is coming; the world is listening. I know that this movement -- your movement -- will grow in influence and scope. My promise to you: I will continue to use my voice as your voice. Together, we can ensure that girls everywhere can go to school and stay in school. You hold our future in your hands. I believe in you. With love and hope, . Freida Pinto .

"(CNN) -- Ziuaddin Yousafzai spent much of his life believing that girls should get an education. He always made sure his daughter Malala understood that. Months after Taliban militants gravely wounded the 15-year-old with a bullet to the head for being vocal about that belief, he thinks more people around the world and in his home country agree with him. Last October, the teenager was riding home in a school van in the Swat Valley, a Taliban stronghold in Pakistan, when masked men stopped the vehicle. They demanded that the other girls identify Malala. The trained their guns on their target and fired. Then they shot another girl, wounding her. Malala was treated by Pakistani doctors in the initial days after the shooting. The prognosis was dire. As international outrage grew, Pakistanis took to the streets. Shooting a little girl? The Taliban had gone too far this time. The government had better do something. Around the world, more people began learning about how the Taliban, years earlier, had ordered that all girls leave school. Malala ""is the daughter of the whole world,"" her father told CNN on Friday. ""The world owns her."" She has become an icon of education, a symbol of girls' rights. ""She has made a difference,"" said. Malala is getting stronger by the day, and ""recovering very well, very fast,"" he added. The teen was discharged from a hospital in Birmingham, England, in February and is receiving rehabilitative care. A team of international doctors who took over Malala's care from Pakistani providers certainly did amazing work in saving her life. They addressed her brain swelling. Her skull had fractured in tiny pieces from the gunshot at close range. She has endured numerous surgeries. But apart from top-notch medicine, sheer force of will that has aided in Malala's recovery. Her attitude has won over people worldwide. In February she was walking, and talking -- and saying she was going to get back to her advocacy for girls' education. ""God has given me this new life,"" she said at the time, in her first on-camera interview. ""I want to serve the people. I want every girl, every child, to be educated."" Ziauddin Yousafzai was an educator for many years and first inspired his daughter to take a stand. But how likely will Malala's work and physical sacrifice actually lead to greater access to quality education for girls in Pakistan? It's unlikely for her own safety that Malala will ever be able to return there, and unlikely for her father as well, say observers who know Pakistan well. iReport: Your messages to Malala . CNN put that question to Ziauddin. Pakistan's government has appointed him education attachÃ© in the Pakistani Consulate in the United Kingdom. Ziauddin responded to the question by first pointing out that before his daughter was attacked, regular Pakistanis would call and tell him that they'd seen Malala speaking out on television and, inspired, enrolled their daughters in school. She'd received a huge amount of global attention, especially from western media, after writing a blog for the Guardian when she was 11. She described her fear that the Taliban would keep her from learning. After Malala was shot, stirring international condemnation, Ziauddin was heartened. ""When this tragic incident happened, small kids, they had posters, banners [with Malala's face and message] and they [related to and knew about] Malala,"" Ziauddin said. ""I think it was a big change."" There have been developments in Pakistan, but it's difficult to call them victories. A university in Pakistan changed its name to include Malala, but then students protested out of fear that Malala's name would draw unwanted and potentially dangerous attention. Malala asked them to remove it. In March, two of Malala's friends were honored -- but those honors would not have been granted had they not been on that bus with Malala. In an interview with CNN, one girl, Shazia Ramzan, said ""God forbid something like that would happen again."" She said she cannot go to visit her uncles or aunts like I used to."" But both girls said they want to be doctors and are going to continue their studies. Time magazine selected her to be runner-up in this year's Person of the Year. This year, Pakistan will observe Malala's 16th birthday as ""Malala Day."" Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown joined Ziauddin in the interview. Brown, now the United Nations special envoy on global education, has been pushing Pakistani authorities to follow through in meaningful, practical ways that will improve girls' access to quality education. Brown in his own words about girls' education in Pakistan . ""I was there in Pakistan at the time [of Malala's shooting],"" Brown said. ""I think 2 million people have signed a petition calling for universal free education."" Brown met with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari, who had visited Malala in the hospital in the U.K. and vowed to stand up for girls' education and fight extremism. Beyond Pakistan, Brown said there seems to be a new passion internationally for ensuring girls' rights. Opinion: Girls' courage, Taliban cowardice . Girls and women are saying, Brown believes, that they are not ""prepared to take this anymore."" Brown noted the cultural complacency toward rape of women in India that was brought to light when a woman was gang-raped in New Delhi in December. She died of wounds from the attack. Demonstrators in Nepal are protesting the severely limited rights of women there, Brown said, and Bangladeshi girls have formed safe zones in which children will never be forced to marry adults, a common practice. Who are the Pakistani Taliban? But inside Pakistan and other parts of the world, change comes slow. ""We thought we would have a 'Malala moment' but that never happened,"" said Pir Zubair Shah, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He was a reporter for the New York Times in Pakistan, working in the Waziristan tribal area along the border with Afghanistan. Ziauddin hosted Shah when he wrote about Malala. ""No one has said, 'Let's slash the defense budget and allocate it to education,'"" Shah said. ""No one has been arrested in the attack on Malala. You have the girls' school who didn't want Malala's name."" He said he doesn't believe there's an heir-apparent for Malala in Pakistan and that safety concerns would make it impossible for her or her father to return. ""You need someone on the ground to lead social change,"" he said. ""It's not the job of Brown or people sitting outside. You have to be there among the people. And right now there is no political leadership who can do that."" The military has failed to chase after militants, the journalist said. And then there's the complex issue of Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban, he noted. ""The government had a chance, an opportunity [in the days after Malala's shooting],"" he said. ""I don't want to be pessimistic, but I'm afraid that chance is probably gone.""","Malala Yousafzai is ""recovering very well, very fast,"" her father said Friday .

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . I was a 12-year-old girl living in the center of Cotonou, Benin, in West Africa. Music was all around us, with the traditional singers and their drums and with the radio blasting songs from the entire world. Singing had always been my passion. My mom even told me I sung before I spoke. One day, I discovered an uplifting song that made everyone dance. It was called ""Pata Pata."" The power and beauty of the voice singing it mesmerized me. I had to get the 45 rpm single right away. That's when I first heard the name of Miriam Makeba, the famous South African singer. I also learned her struggle against apartheid and her success all over the planet. Even though at home I could see the respect that my father had for my mom, I could feel the world was unbalanced and that it was so hard for girls and women to succeed. Many of my girlfriends at school were dropping out at an early age as the social pressure was huge. Most of them could not choose their own destiny. It was as if they would always be the daughter, the wife or the mother of someone. But looking at Miriam's smile on the cover, her confidence and the respect she inspired, I started to dream. If an exiled African woman born from a poor family had been able to accomplish so much, there might be a little chance for me to follow her steps. Lost in my thoughts, lying on my bed, listening to her music for hours, learning by heart the lyrics of all her songs -- in my imagination, I was already traveling with her, singing with her, meeting world leaders and advocating with her for the freedom of her people. That dream has never left me. I grew up and I experienced much rejection, many obstacles, but Miriam's voice was always singing in my head. I started to have some success singing on the national radio. One day, on the way back from school, a group of teenagers recognized me and insulted me, calling me a whore because I was a singer. I came back home, crying, and wanted to give up singing for good. Mama Congo, my maternal grandmother, happened to be home. She asked me why I was crying so much. Once I explained, she gave me a piece of advice that I have never forgotten and that I want you to remember when you feel your dreams are shattered. She told me: ""Do you want to be a singer?"" ""Yes, Grandma"" ""Then, you can't let the opinion of other people discourage you. Don't give up on your dreams, don't allow them to define who you are or they would have won!"" Many years passed. I left my country like Miriam had done. I worked hard, listening to constructive critics and ignoring the naysayers, keeping Miriam's songs close to my heart. Then, in a different decade, in a different country, the day finally came when I was asked to sing as the opening act of my beloved idol. I could not believe it.

"(CNN) -- The calendar is overflowing with occasions to mark. It seems like there's a special day for almost everything. For example, September 19 is celebrated by some as International Talk Like a Pirate Day. But the surplus of observances shouldn't detract from the really important ones, like Friday, March 8, International Women's Day. The first International Women's Day was held in 1911, but it was international only in the technical sense that women in four European nations marched. These activists were ahead of their time in thinking about women's economic and political equality; they may not have been so far ahead of their time that they envisioned what it has come to mean for many of us today. Now, International Women's Day represents a movement that is for every woman and girl, no matter where they live. This year, Malala Yousafzai became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history by risking her life for the cause of universal girls' education. Her courage has inspired women across the world. Some of the bravest, most revolutionary voices about empowerment are coming from women and girls like Malala who are calling the world's attention to social norms that prevent women from realizing their full potential. I just spent some time visiting the poorest parts of Northern India, where I met a courageous woman named Sharmila Devi. Because the government has invested in its basic health system, she received a visit from a trained health worker who told her that spacing her pregnancies was safer for herself and her children. Sharmila decided to use contraceptives despite the opposition of her mother-in-law. In India, husbands and mothers-in-law have been at the core of family decision making power structures for generations. Sharmila's courage in seeking outside information and defying her parents-in-law as a way to determine her own future and improve that of her children represents a huge leap forward for women throughout the country. Here is the reality we must confront on International Women's Day: The decisions women make about their families are the key to improving life for many of the poorest communities in the world. The evidence shows that in the developing world, women play a different role than men and are more likely to take care of their family's health care and nutrition, things that children need to become productive adults and contribute to the economic and social development of societies. In fact, research has shown that a child's chances of survival increase by 20% when the mother controls the household budget. Yet in many places, women, especially young women, have very little decision-making authority to be able to effect this kind of change. The work of making sure that women and girls everywhere can seize their potential is about making specific changes that will set into motion these longer term outcomes. For me, it means making sure they have access to the contraceptives so many women tell me they want and need. It's also about harder to measure changes like whether they have the information and the power to plan their families on their own terms. When I try to imagine the future, I am optimistic because I see women demanding information and opportunities in the face of social norms that say they're not permitted to do so. I'm also optimistic because no matter where I go, people ask me, ""What can I do to help?"" Malala and Devi aren't the only heroes. Millions of peopleâ€”men and womenâ€”stand by the conviction that empowered women are a source of progress, and they want to take action. That's why I'm proud to announce the launch of my team page on Catapult.org, a crowd-funding platform dedicated to supporting women and girls. I identified these three great projects from GirlUp, Breakthrough, and Jacaranda Health and hope you can join Catapult to help fund them. Our foundation will match every dollar donated to these projects. Together, we can help women and girls determine their own future, no matter where they're from. To me, this is why marking International Women's Day is important. It's a chance for so many people to move beyond ""celebrating"" and take action to create meaningful and sustainable change for women and girls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melinda Gates.","Melinda Gates: International Women's Day started small a century ago .

"(CNN) -- Recalling her father brings tears to her eyes. ""I cried and I cried,"" says Senna, remembering the day her father passed away. Senna, 14, lives in La Rinconada, Peru. Her father died after spending years toiling in the town's mines. He never had the chance to go to school, but dreamed one day of becoming an engineer. A dream that he passed on to his daughter. It is his words that bring her strength today. ""Don't be like me,"" he would tell her. ""Make a better person of yourself, Senna. Study."" But like everything in La Rinconada, getting an education is tough. This mining town of about 30,000 people sits three miles in the air and is considered to be the highest city in the world. Living conditions are harsh. Besides the altitude, the town has no running water and no sewage system. ""Education is really very low on the sense of priorities. There are no laws, no police, no one seeing that children are going to school,"" says ""Girl Rising"" writer Maria Arana. In the Puno province, where La Rinconada is located, nearly 68% of the population lives below the poverty line. The men work in the mines. Women sell goods, look for gold in discarded mine rocks or make money from prostitution. ""This is not a place for kids,"" says Senna . Even where schools are available, many parents need their children's help with work. ""If mother is mashing rock, she may want help,"" says Arana. ""There are no rules in La Rinconada."" According to CARE, nearly 29% of indigenous children in Peru do not attend school. But CARE is trying to change that. In 2003, the aid organization began working in La Rinconada to educate people about need for formal education and the dangers of child labor. Now, over 23,000 children receive assistance at the kindergarten, elementary and high school levels. Senna is one of these students and is now on the path to do something that no one in her family has done -- go to college. ""I have various dreams.

Watch a preview of 'Girl Rising' Academy Award nominee Richard Robbins, who directed ""Girl Rising,"" talks about why he made the film, how crowd-sourcing was key and why the word ""revolutionary"" kept sticking with them, in this interview, edited for length and clarity. CNN: Why did you decide to make the film? Richard Robbins: I started reading about some of the new research about girls' education in about 2005, 2006, and I thought at first that it was just information that was new to me. That somehow I had missed this incredible fact about how powerful educating girls could be. And then over the course of a couple of months in my research, it became clear that this is not a widely known fact. Although it was well-known inside the development community, out in the general public, it didn't seem to be well understood. As a filmmaker, that's an opportunity that's hard to pass up. When you come across something that is clearly important and unequivocally proven and yet not widely known, you pay attention. CNN's 'Girl Rising' CNN: How would you define the making of? Robbins: One of the great luxuries we had in making this film was time. The time to go to each of these countries three times to really spend time thinking about what the issues were and what we wanted to say in each place and how we wanted to say it. On the first trip to each country ... we went and did dozens and dozens of interviews and tried to find the right girl to be the focus of the film, although those choices about which girl it would be were ultimately made by the writers. It felt important to me that the writers who were going to write their stories choose for themselves who they felt most compelled to write about. And then the second trip, we went back and spent time with the writer and the girl together. ... It wasn't until the third trip that we actually sat out to try and make each piece. So, we got to know each girl very well. That was a real virtue for us. Sometimes, when you're working on film and television projects, you sort of parachute in and spend a couple of days and then leave. But coming back for the second and the third time, I felt like we really earned the trust of both the girls and their families and their communities. ... There's more to come for each of these girls. I do think we want to protect them. We're very concerned about their safety going forward. And we are careful in the film not to talk about these girls' last names, not to talk too specifically about where they live. ... In both Egypt and Afghanistan, there were safety concerns for the girls themselves, so we ended up using actresses in those two chapters because we just wanted to be sure that the girls who were telling their stories were safe. CNN: What is the message you want this film to communicate to the world? Robbins: Well, I think there are sort of two key messages in my mind, and one is intellectual, and one is more emotional. The intellectual message is simple: Educating girls works. We know it works; we know why it works; we know how it works. And unlike a lot of big global problems that we face in the world, whether it's global warming or religious conflict or the AIDS epidemic, we actually know what the solution is to this problem. We know how to educate girls. Most of us know what a good school looks like, a good teacher looks like. So this is change we can really create in the world. And I think that's really important. But even for people who know that information, for people who understand how powerful education can be, we want them to understand that these girls out there are not victims, they're opportunities. They just need a little bit of help, and they are going to be more determined and work harder than any of the rest of us have to work to help them achieve their goals. ... Ultimately, they're just like the girls that we know: our girls and our sisters and daughters and friends. You know, I think so often, we tend to see people out there in poor parts of the world as so different from us because their world looks different from the one that we live in. But they're really not. You know, at the end of the day, they're just kids, and they're kids who want to learn. CNN: ""Girl Rising"" had its theatrical release beginning in March. How did crowdsourcing play a role in the project? Robbins: We really opened up the filmmaking process to people out there who were interested in this issue. And we posted videos, photographs and blog posts (because) we really wanted people to get engaged long before there was even a film to show. And then once we got to the place where there was a film, it became clear to us that we had an incredible team of supporters and fans out there in the world. And that they were a very powerful resource to get the film out into the world. So we had partners, we had campus groups, we had our nonprofit partners in the field, and we had regular folks who had been following our progress either on Twitter or on Facebook. We reached out to them and said, 'Look, the film is done. We really want as many people as we can to see it. We don't have a huge advertising budget, so lend a hand, be an organizer for us.' We almost modeled the distribution of this film like a political campaign. We thought of it more as a movement than as a piece of entertainment. So if we could get people out there to host a screening and do a little bit of the leg work to organize it, publicize it, sell tickets and bring it to their community, that was an asset that I think most films don't have, and that was completely invaluable to us. CNN: In ""Girl Rising,"" one of the narrators, Meryl Streep, says a line about how there's a single moment between what is and what could be. Do you think a girl somewhere will see this film and have that singular moment and it propels them to do something as well? Robbins: When we were making the film, we talked a lot about the idea that these girls really did feel like revolutionaries. And we had a lot of talk about that word: revolutionary. And the reason it kept sticking with us is because when you meet these girls you realize that their goals, the things that they want to change, are not just about their own lives. It's about changing their entire community, their family, the world for the better. So often, we think of young people, particularly in the United States, as being very self-interested, but over and over again, we found girls who wanted to create change not for themselves but for everybody around them. ... So, it really is a forward-thinking push from those girls and from the film. The idea that we really do, as individuals, have the power to create change in the world. I think so often, we are led to feel helpless because of the forces that play in the world are big and overwhelming and very challenging. But small-scale change, cumulatively, can be incredibly powerful. We saw it in the lives of each one of these girls and with our incredible partners that were doing amazing work in the field to help girls go to school. That idea is really at the crux of this film, which is that change is possible, we know how it works, and it's within our reach. It's not some impossible dream. We really can make this happen. We understand how to do it, and we just need the will to make it a reality. CNN's 'Girl Rising' Write an open letter to girls of the world .

"(CNN) -- Eulalia goes to school on a motorcycle. The 10-year-old girl lives in the Puno region of Peru with her parents and six siblings. There is no school near Eulalia's home, so on Mondays, her father gives her a ride down the mountain on his motorcycle to a boarding school run by the humanitarian organization CARE. She attends school during the week and comes home on the weekends. For Eulalia, this ride to school is a journey into a promising future that is hard to come by in Peru. She is one of nearly a million indigenous children who struggle to get an education. According to CARE, 73% of indigenous kids in Peru are behind in school for their age and nearly 30% don't go to school at all. Most people in the Puno region live in poverty and parents have no choice but to have their children work to help support the family. Child labor is often used for illegal gold mining in the area. Eulalia's father is a poor alpaca shepherd, but he wants his daughter to have a better education than he had and he has made it a priority. The school doesn't charge Eulalia's family for school fees, but her parents try to contribute in other ways such as with crops or labor. Soon, her little brother will also be attending the school. Eulalia's favorite subject is math but her father says she likes ""everything."" When she grows up, she wants to be a teacher. Eulalia's loving spirit is what endears her to the people at CARE. ""I can tell you, she is the sweetest of them all ... quite shy, but at the same time very loving once she knows people a bit. The first time she visited our office, she gave big hugs to all my colleagues, and that's how she is remembered here, as 'the little hugger',"" says Elsie Ralston of CARE. Eulalia studies a bilingual curriculum with CARE's Education Program. The school is a private project founded by a company that wants all its workers to be able to provide education for children in the area. CARE's Education Program in Peru promotes proper schooling for children and adolescents in vulnerable conditions, as well as the elimination of discrimination in all its forms. ""The innovative bilingual and intercultural approach allows us to empower girls in urban and rural areas. CARE seeks to address the barriers Peruvian boys, but especially girls, face, while actively advocating the investment of public resources to education,"" Ralston says. CARE has similar educational programs around the world to assist and empower girls and young women. You can help CARE continue to help girls like Eulalia in Peru.

"Swat, Pakistan (CNN) -- Driving in Pakistan's Swat valley, a region located close to the border with Afghanistan, I can sense the difference immediately. The faces of young children, women and families who walk around seem relaxed. The streets buzz with an air of calm. Swat is full of life once again. It's a marked difference from the previous times I've been here. The last time was shortly after Malala Yousafzai was shot. Back then, a sense of sorrow and shock hung in the air. Everything felt still and drained. The town was in mourning. In these past nine months, we have written and read so much about Malala. It boils down to this -- a 15-year-old schoolgirl was shot at point blank range for encouraging girls to go to school. In pictures: Malala's road to recovery . The residents have not forgotten the horrific events of October 2012 -- especially the young people who had to return to school. In most places going to school does not mean risking your life, but in Swat -- that's exactly what young girls and boys have been doing. They defy threats from the Taliban. Global view . The Pakistani Taliban ran a ruthless campaign of bombing girls' schools and carrying out public executions in 2007-2008. Then, the shooting of Malala last year brought the world's attention to the issue. But how are other young women and Swat dealing with the impact of events? I traveled to the Swat valley to find out. In pictures: The world's other Malalas . It wasn't easy finding somewhere to film. I contacted several schools and colleges. CNN asked to film at Malala's school but the principal declined. She wants to encourage young girls to continue going to school, she does not want them to become a target. Malala's shooting put the spotlight on Swat and the young women there. Not everyone enjoys that focus. They fear reprisal attacks. They fear the Taliban will attack them simply for picking up a school book. I visited a girls' college in Swat soon after Malala's shooting last October. The young women I spoke to were adamant they would continue with their education. Their college was due to be renamed the Malala Yousafzai College in her honor. But days later authorities changed their minds -- the girls and their parents said they would be too scared to attend if it was associated with Malala. Girls defiant . We were given permission to film at a women's college for science and technology. Most of the girls were local, but some had come all the way from Peshawar to study in Swat. It's a sign of how things are changing here. Years of Taliban brutality both in Swat and the surrounding areas have clearly left a lasting impact on the people there. The young girls I spoke to have not forgotten the images of death and destruction. They tell me about what they saw, how it filled them with fear and dread. They hug me and thank me for coming to see them. Uzma Sajad, 17, speaks confidently at first, but when asked about the Taliban, the psychological impact is visible. She is breathless and nervous, but determined to speak out. ""It was a real crisis all over -- especially girls were not allowed to get educated, now it's completely freedom,"" she says. ""Everything has changed. We are free to go to our schools or colleges, wherever we want, it's freedom all over. ""It makes me really proud and really happy."" Dreams of educated future . I ask another girl, named Sara, if her fear of the Taliban ever made her think twice about coming to school or college. She looks me in the eye and says with conviction, ""We should not stop education because of someone else. Or because of the scare [fear] of something."" She has dreams that extend beyond her education. ""I want to be an engineer in future,"" she says. ""I love engineering. I don't know why, but I hope to be an engineer. "" People around the world have heard of Malala, but she is not alone. She is not the only one fighting for female education. Every girl I met in those classrooms, every single one is defying the Taliban simply by going to school. Some are breaking new ground for their families as the first women to make it to college or plan careers. Others are breaking cultural taboos. All of them are standing up for their rights. ""Yes, there was a time when young girls couldn't get an education, but women didn't give up hope or strength,"" says Anam. She is just 17, but her confidence and wisdom belies her young age. ""We studied in our homes, we hid and came to school in secret. Pakistan's females are very strong, and brave,"" she says. Family support . Of course this would not be possible if their parents did not make the bold and brave decision to send their daughters to school. With a smile on her face, she says that they ""supported me in every field of my life. They told me that whatever job you like you can do it."" I asked Uzma why an education was so important to her. She told me confidently, ""I want to be independent. I want to be myself, I don't want to be dependent on somebody else -- my parents or anybody. That's why I want to be educated. "" The experiences of these young girls have clearly molded them to be mature beyond their years. ""We are not scared now,"" Uzma adds. ""We want to seek knowledge and learn more and more, and Insha'Allah if God is with us, we will do it."" ""I'll realize my dreams, as well as my parents' dreams. I'm strong, my friends are strong and I think all girls of Pakistan are strong and we'll prove it.""","CNN's Saima Mohsin returns to Swat valley where Malala was shot .

"(CNN) -- Sal Dimiceli has spent decades helping people get back on their feet. Through a local newspaper column and his nonprofit, The Time Is Now To Help, Dimiceli assists about 500 people a year with food, rent, utilities and other necessities. He concentrates most of his work in the Wisconsin area where he lives. CNN asked Dimiceli for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: How does it feel to be selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Sal Dimiceli: I'm ecstatic. I want to cry thinking that CNN and people recognize the poverty that is out there so we can help even more people. I hesitate to talk about myself. My heart is about giving, helping, not receiving. This is such a great, great honor. At the same time, the help I provide is from my desire, my heart, to ease the pain and suffering and fear of the poverty-stricken. I find myself in tears. For many years, I felt alone making money, giving it away helping the less fortunate, and now I'm being recognized for doing what I vowed to do. I'm in shock. I thank God and CNN for telling the world: ""Yes, something can be done. Yes, together we can make a difference."" CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to The Time Is Now to Help? Dimiceli: I hope it will bring an awareness of what's going on in our great country behind closed doors and show how more than 50 million Americans are desperately suffering the pains of poverty. By showing how we are coming together, networking with people to find solutions for helping them, I pray that other areas around the U.S. will come together with their local people to make a difference. My biggest prayer is that our government will put aside their differences and exercise the simple solutions that do exist for any problem they presently have. ... The one thing I keep trying to grasp is the fact that the global news media, CNN, is recognizing the philanthropy and love all over the world and the solutions we are presenting. CNN is my hero for taking all of us to the forefront, recognizing that we are making a big difference in the world around us. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Dimiceli: I'm going to put that right into the charity (and) use that for immediate funding. That's why it's called The Time Is Now. I can never catch up with the requests for help financially. And with this recession right now, there are a lot of people in extreme desperate need. People who are homeless, we'll help them get shelter; people who are hungry, we're going to feed them; people who have utilities off, we're going to turn them on; people that need transportation, we'll help fix their cars. Every penny is going to help our fellow creations in dire need, and I'm going to do it as expeditiously as I can. We're going to utilize all of our several hundred volunteers to make sure we can end their pain and suffering and show them there are people that care. We want to give them hope and show them that we do have a love for all people. I can't wait. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Dimiceli: Everything that I did to help others would not be possible if it wasn't for my mother. I grew up as a little boy watching her cry through our utilities being off, of us being evicted, of us having little food, and with her pride of not letting people know. It's because of all those tears I saw on and off for many years. If it wasn't for my dear mother, I wouldn't be doing this. I made a promise to God at 12 years old. I'm 60 now, and I'm going to keep that promise for as long as I can breathe. Read the full story on CNN Hero Sal Dimiceli: .

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . Some of you will be familiar with the childhood rhyme, ""What are little girls made of? Sugar and spice and all things nice, that's what little girls are made of."" Marketing and stereotyping combine to have us believe that you're also made of pink dresses, pigtails, dolls, ringlets, ribbons, bows and tiaras. That you like cupcakes. That all you will want to be are wives and mothers. That you're more ""inclined"" to the arts and ""better suited"" to caring professions like teaching and nursing. And, maybe, that's true for some. But my daughter Salma teaches me every day that there's so much more to you -- and for you. Salma is 13, and I can count, on one hand (in fact, on one finger!), the occasions she's worn a dress -- and they've never been pink! Dolls always stayed on the shelf. She's happiest dribbling a soccer ball past her brothers and scoring goals or building model airplanes with her father. She dreams of being an engineer. That's my Salma; that's why I love her. So, when I think about girls rising, I think of girls like her and her sister, Iman. I think of the millions of courageous girls all over the Arab world and beyond who, every day, summon inner strength, surmount barriers and make a difference in their communities. Let me tell you about 16-year-old Wafa Al-Rimi. Some days in Yemen, there's less than one hour of electricity, so studying is tough. ""We were tired of darkness,"" Wafa said in an interview. Rather than accept defeat, though, she built foundations under her dreams. With help from business mentors, she formed an all-female company that created solar-powered lights. They won INJAZ Al-Arab's Best Company of the Year in November. Wafa and her friends are part of a new generation of independent-thinking Middle Eastern girls: torch-bearers and trail-blazers. Today, almost as many girls as boys attend primary and secondary school. In the majority of Arab countries where there's data, women outnumber men at university, and more women than men study science. I see and I hear that determination to succeed every day in Jordan. Recently, I visited a girls' school in the south of Jordan where 12-year-old Noor told me about her grandmother, a famous storyteller who narrated other people's stories. Noor was proud of her ""teta,"" but she had her own dream. ""I want to be mayor,"" she said. ""I want to build a library full of books; I want to build a park so that children can play safely."" Noor wanted to write her own story. I knew then that she, and girls like her, would write a new chapter for our region. It won't be easy. We have a long way to go. Increases in girls' attendance at school and university are not yet reflected in politics, the job market or society's mindsets. And there are still 5 million girls out of primary and secondary school across the Arab world. But as the political, social and economic plates shift and settle around our region, there's never been a better time for girls to rise up and share their talents with society. And, girls! Society has never needed you more. We know that in every country around the world, healthy, educated girls can play a crucial role in stabilizing societies, resolving conflicts, bolstering democracies, strengthening economies and nurturing healthy and educated children. But they can't do it alone. Role models can inspire. Campaigns can motivate. But if we want all girls everywhere to rise up, then we must find them, befriend them and support them. That means going outside our comfort zones. Maybe they're recovering from civil war in Sierra Leone, like Mariama -- now educated and a popular radio DJ. Maybe they're trapped in servitude in Nepal, like Suma -- now an activist working to free others. Maybe they're living in slums in India, like Ruksana -- now strong and in school. (Find out more about their stories.) And it means using our voices to speak up for those who cannot yet be heard. Lobbying for girl-friendly policies. Working with governments, non-governmental organizations, U.N. agencies and the private sector to create momentum for change. Will it be easy? No. Will it be as hard as studying in the dark or sleeping on a pavement? Enduring slavery or rebuilding a life after war? Going to school hungry and still achieving good grades? Certainly not. And if we falter in our resolve, let's remember the strength and dignity of Wafa, Noor, Mariama, Suma, Ruksana and girls everywhere who, every day, fight for their right to education and opportunity. If one girl with courage is a revolution, imagine what feats we can achieve together. -- Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah .

"(CNN) -- ""The stupidity is simply staggering,"" Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, told Roll Call. He was referring to the political miscalculation of anti-abortion forces in the House Judiciary Committee who insisted this week on reviving the culture wars, years behind us, still again, with yet another proposed abortion bill. This bill, championed by Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks, sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide, with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. ""I'll be very frank: I discouraged our leadership from bringing this to a vote on the floor,"" Dent said. My e-mail box was flooded with headlines that began ""This again?"" and ""This ... is the GOP's idea of outreach to women? Really?"" and ""He said what?"" The latter referred to a remark by Franks, chairman of the committee, that ""incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low,"" as a justification for the bill ignoring rape and incest victims. Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were apparently willing to allow the time when an abortion is legal to be reduced by one month. They sought to add exceptions for rape, incest and the woman's health -- all of which were rejected by Republicans on the panel. But it appears the House Republican leaders, recognizing a train wreck, added the language to the bill anyway to avoid an embarrassing defeat. The bill will also include an exception for a medical emergency in which the woman might die. This new altered version goes before the Rules Committee on Monday. There are, by the way, 22 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. All men. Not a single woman. It's hard to avoid inflammatory remarks when discussing rape. And the line between inflammatory and insulting is thin. It's also porous. So if Franks thought he had to address the issue of rape, he should have done so judiciously. His remark says to women impregnated by rape: You don't count. There aren't enough of you to matter. That's not just insensitive; it's immoral. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, first pounced on the statement's factual inaccuracy. ""I just find it astonishing to hear a phrase repeated that the incidence of pregnancy from rape is low,"" she said. ""There's no scientific basis for that."" Then Lofgren, one of five women among the Democratic minority on the committee, added, ""And the idea that the Republican men on this committee can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous."" It might be that Franks' argument, such as it is, echoed a comment by Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin, who claimed during his Senate campaign last fall that women's bodies have a built-in mechanism to prevent impregnation from ""a legitimate rape."" Aiken's candidacy went into a tailspin from that misinformed remark, and never recovered. Fact checkers have pointed to studies that indicate Franks' claim is as suspect as Akin's. One study by St. Lawrence University found that pregnancies resulting from rape were higher than from other instances. Franks later walked back his low-pregnancy-from-rape argument, saying he was not claiming it was harder to get pregnant from rape. Franks apparently based his claim on there being fewer pregnancies from rape than from consensual intercourse. Even so, that's a ""Duh, do the math"" excuse. GOP aides now say Rep. Marsha Blackburn will be managing Franks' anti-abortion bill. Given her record -- ""no"" votes on major equality or women-protection legislation and ""yea"" for issues like ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood -- that's hardly an improvement. And it misses the point. It's not the who, it's the what -- the argument itself does not stand. During the Judiciary debate, Franks said, ""When you make that exception, there's usually a requirement to report the rape within 48 hours. And in this case that's impossible. ... And that's what completely negates and vitiates the purpose for such an amendment."" So, Franks' argument then became a technical one, that if a rape wasn't reported, a decision after 20 weeks to abort was made too late. But why is it too late? Does psychological trauma have a timetable? Each case of rape that produces a pregnancy is as individual as the woman who was raped. And the ordeal -- psychological, emotional, physical, spiritual -- is not term-limited. The issue of abortion raises real and poignant moral questions. Franks made many remarks that show his obvious, deeply felt, conviction that abortions after 20 weeks are wrong. But majorities in Congress and of Americans, also with deep conviction, came to a different conclusion: They feel compelled to support exceptions for rape, incest and health. Franks' outrageous comment and the viewpoints of other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee illustrate that when one party becomes so narrowly composed that it represents a particular religious culture, we're headed to what people in other countries face when a ruling party begins making laws from religious theology, without regard to a democratic, secular society -- thus excluding other religious viewpoints and dismissing those who suffer as too few to matter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Judiciary Republicans sought anti-abortion bill with no exception for rape, incest .

"Beijing (CNN) -- When Hu Jintao steps down as leader of China's Communist Party this month, not everyone will view his record over the last 10 years favorably. All told, it's a record of rapid social and economic changes punctuated by political turmoil, disaster and crackdowns. Working in tandem with Premier Wen Jiabao, the 69-year-old Hu is credited for solidifying China's position as a rising global power. But Hu also has his share of critics. ""Although the reform and opening has given the party huge fortune, the distribution of wealth has been extremely uneven,"" said Zhang Ming, from the Department of Political Science at Renmin University in China. Many ordinary Chinese agree. ""China as a nation has become richer and stronger,"" said Li Yong, a white-collar worker in Beijing. ""But many people are not feeling rich and strong. It seems prosperity has not trickled down much."" ""Guofu, minqiong""-- the nation has become richer, the people poorer -- this is one popular assessment of Hu's time in office. That rings ironic, observers say, given Hu's image as a populist politician. An engineer with extensive experience in China's poor, underdeveloped interior provinces, Hu worked his way up the ranks of the party through the Communist Youth League (CYL), a training ground of party cadres that now boasts about 70 million members. From the CYL, Hu was appointed as party chief in China's impoverished western provinces of Guizhou and Tibet. In 1992, he was singled out by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping for promotion as the ""core"" of the younger generation, strategically given a place in the elite Politburo. Five years later, he became the youngest member of the Politburo's Standing Committee -- the country's elite decision-making body -- lining him up as the presumptive leader of the ""fourth generation."" He took charge at the 16th Party Congress in 2002 when he succeeded President Jiang Zemin as Communist Party chief, before taking over as state president the following year. Hu has tried to carve out his legacy by championing the country's ""scientific development,"" a catchphrase for his policies, which sought more balanced, equitable and sustainable development, rather than breakneck economic growth as pursued by his predecessor, Jiang. Hu's program called for increased social spending to help poor or unemployed farmers and urban workers to ensure social stability, or ""weiwen."" In the last party congress five years ago, Hu managed to amend the party's constitution to include his scientific development mantra. It was widely viewed as a sign that he had consolidated his power five years after succeeding Jiang. Under Hu's watch, China has become the world's second largest economy. The World Bank estimates its GDP to be $7.318 billion, as factors such as low labor costs and an undervalued currency combined to boost economic growth between 2003 and 2007. He is also credited with improving the country's military and boosting national pride. In 2008, China hosted the Olympic games, putting the spotlight on China's emergence as a world power. In June this year, China completed its first manned space docking -- a significant milestone in its bid to construct a space station -- and sent its first female astronaut into orbit, only the third country ever to do so. In October, China sent its first aircraft carrier to sea, emblematic of China's growing ability to project its military power beyond its borders. But Hu has always advocated China's ""peaceful rise,"" which observers take to mean building a prosperous and ""harmonious society."" Critics say he has failed to achieve this goal. ""In these 10 years, China is nothing close to harmonious,"" said Zhang. ""Conflicts and contradictions have become worse. In fact it is reaching a crisis point."" When faced with ethnic unrest in Tibet in 2008 and the restive Xinjiang province in western China in 2009, Hu showed his steely side by cracking down harshly, using the police and the military, and censoring related content on the Internet. Hu's regime likewise showed little tolerance towards political opposition, rounding up the most vocal dissidents and social activists, putting them in prison, under house arrest or making them disappear for weeks. The most prominent victims of political repression include Nobel peace laureate Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia, Sakharov Prize awardee Hu Jia, artist Ai Wei Wei, and blind activist Chen Guangcheng. Under Hu, China has kept a tight control of the media, especially the country's huge social media community. In March, for example, Internet regulators required the 300 million microbloggers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service, to register their real names on posts to make then more accountable. ""Post-2007, Hu strengthened the coercive arm of the state,"" said David Zweig, political professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. But Hu has failed to narrow the country's widening wealth gap. Speaking at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil in June, China's Premier said his country still has more than 100 million people living below the poverty line -- despite the size of its economy. A study earlier this year by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in China found that China's top 10% of households surveyed have 57% of the total income and 85% of total assets. Recent years have seen a growing rural-urban disparity with millions moving to cities to improve their income prospects. Meanwhile, those who believed Hu would open up China's political system would be likewise disappointed. He has called Western-style democracy a ""blind alley"" and has resisted pressure to pursue even the most modest reform of the political system. With little transparency, accountability and pluralism, the Communist Party under Hu has made little progress in curbing endemic corruption in the party and the government. ""Hu is seen to have been weak leader, missing opportunities, and putting excessive concern for order, his so-called 'hexie shehui' (harmonious society),"" said Zweig. ""Criticisms (of Hu's rule) have even come from the Central Party School, where Xi Jinping is president."" Xi, the state's current vice president, is expected to take over from Hu as General Secretary of the party at end of the 18th Party Congress. Yet the months leading up to the congress have brought fractious back-room bargaining among the party elite, which is divided between informal ""elitist"" and ""populist"" factions. Xi's ability to enforce unity at the top will determine how the new leadership will manage China's emergence as a global superpower and how it copes with its domestic problems. ""Demand from below for change is great,"" said Zweig. ""But Xi Jinping may have to wait until he consolidates his power before he could push his own reform package."" That, he added, may take the 59 year old several months, or even one or two years.","Hu Jintao will be stepping down as China's leader at the 18th Party Congress .
Likely to be replaced by his current vice president, Xi Jinping .
Hu presided over China as it became the world's second biggest economy .
However critics point to growing rich-poor divide, corruption, authoritarian rule ."
"(CNN) -- Purnima lives in Nepal. She wants to be a nurse. But because she is a girl instead of a boy, she is more likely to go to work than go to school. In Nepal, government schools start charging tuition in the sixth grade. But Purnima was selected to be part of the Girls Education program with the nonprofit Room to Read and was able to continue her education. ""I am the first person getting an education in my family and my brother and sisters did not get the chance due to our family background ... we are from a poor family so we cannot afford to go to school,"" says Purnima. Purnima lives with her family in a room above the carpet factory where her older sister works. Her father is paralyzed. Her mother became blind when Purnima was 2 years old. All her siblings stopped going to school after the fifth grade. Purnima is 17 and has just finished secondary school at the top of her class. In fact, she was at the top of her class every year. Purnima is about to start two years of Nepal's post-secondary school and she plans to go on to college. For a long time, she wanted to be an eye doctor. Now she says she is going to be a nurse and she may have a good chance to do just that. According to Room to Read, about 76% of its graduates go on to some kind of university, college or vocational training after secondary school. The nonprofit Room to Read start working in Nepal more than 13 years ago. The organization now works for gender equality in education and overall literacy in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Vietnam and Zambia. ""Help them see their dreams and put them on the path to success ... with the life skills, drive and understanding, we get girls to the next step,"" says Rebecca Hankin of Room to Read. Room to Read works to develop literacy skills and a habit of reading among all schoolchildren. But it also tries to ensure girls have the skills and support needed to complete their secondary education. More than 7 million children have been given access to education through the nonprofit's network of libraries and schools. Kamlari - Nepal's modern slavery . Another obstacle for girls trying to get an education in Nepal is Kamlari. An illegal but still widely accepted tradition in Nepal, Kamlari is a system in which parents contract their daughters into indentured servitude for several years, often when the girls are as young as 5 or 6. They work long hours and are often physically and emotionally abused. Purnima was never sold as a Kamlari. In Nepal's Bardiya district, more than 600 ex-Kamlari girls are enrolled in Room to Read's Girls Education program. How you can help Kamlari girls and girls like Purnima in Nepal: . Give . You can help girls like Purnima go to school and chase their dreams by donating to Room to Read's Girls Education program. Thousands of girls in Nepal and other countries have been helped through school with books, school fees and mentorship. According to Room to Read, 96% of girls in the program advance to the next grade. Get involved . Volunteer for Room to Read in your community.

"(CNN) -- A Chicago couple never planned to turn their trip to Cambodia into a mission to help educate girls. But that's exactly what happened. Bill and Lauren Smith had traveled to the Southeast Asian country often. During a 2002 visit, a taxi driver asked the Smiths if they wanted to see ""the children."" Not really knowing what he meant, they agreed. The driver took them about 25 minutes outside the capital of Phnom Penh. On their arrival, they saw hundreds of people on giant mountains of garbage. ""There were flies everywhere,"" Bill said. ""There were snakes and rats and the stench; you were just gagging."" His wife added, ""I had to breathe through my mouth not to smell it."" But they said they were most shocked by all the young children going through the garbage. These kids were scavenging for metal, plastic, glass and anything else they could sell to a recycler to make money. Each child would make about $10 a month at the dump to help out their families, Bill said. A photographer for Chicago sports teams including the Bears and Blackhawks, Bill started snapping pictures of the dump. But the experience haunted him and his wife. ""We were just tourists,"" he said. ""But we thought we could help one person."" They came back the next day and decided to focus on a child to save from the dump. One girl stuck out in Lauren's mind, she said. ""I remember seeing this little girl with the red hat. And I don't know if it was the red hat or it was her eyes ... these big eyes (that) ... just looked kind of hopeless."" Through their driver, who spoke some English, they found out the girl's name was Sreyna. They drove her home to talk to her mother about a way to get the 10-year-old out of the dump and into school. When they arrived, they met her sister Salim, 12, and decided they would help them both. They made a deal with the girls' mother. ""We're going to pay you whatever they would make at the dump,"" Bill recalled telling the mother. ""We're going to make sure you have food at the table, and in exchange for this you have to promise us that you'll make sure they go to school every day. You'll make sure they stay in school, and you'll make sure they never go to the dump again."" The mother agreed, and the Smiths gave their trusted driver money to fund the plan for the girls for the next six months. The couple also found two other girls they decided to sponsor during their trip. Returning home to Chicago, the Smiths showed their photos to friends and family and told them what they were doing with the girls. Many decided they wanted to help, too, and gave the Smiths money to fund more children. Bill also started doing fund-raisers with a slide show called ""From the Sports World to the Third World."" He would show his photos of the sports teams he covered and then scenes of orphanages, landmine survivors and the children at the dump in Cambodia. ""By now, the whole room's in tears,"" Bill recalled. A newspaper wrote an article about what the Smiths were doing, and soon they were getting donations from all over the country. They ended up starting a nonprofit organization called A New Day Cambodia. Today, the organization has two centers where they house about 100 girls and boys. And the concept is the same as it was from the start. The group pays the parents what their children would make at the dump in exchange for the kids going to school. And these efforts are paying off. Today, the sisters the Smiths initially helped are attending Harold Washington College in Chicago. Sreyna is studying hospitality, with hopes of working in the hotel and restaurant industry. Salim is studying English and wants to become a teacher. Over the years, they became close to the Smiths, spending a lot of time together traveling. Salim says she feels like they are her second family. Without the Smiths and an education, it's hard to say where the two girls would be now. ""Education is really important to me personally, because I see it as a bridge,"" Sreyna says, adding, ""Education to me is like a second life.""

"(CNN) -- Over the past year I've revisited a host of Southeast Asian countries I first began traveling in more than a decade ago. The region's progress has been remarkable both in terms of overall economic growth and the promising opening of formerly isolated nations like Myanmar. With China's slowing growth and rising wages, investors and exporters are searching for new long-term opportunities and sites of production. The time of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has come. Last month in Laos, I met a Malay-Laotian couple with modest backgrounds who met while on fellowships in Japan. After their respective graduate degrees, they reunited in Vientiane where they advise government agencies, donors and NGOs. Their cross-border mobility is a symbol of an entire new generation of upwardly progressive Southeast Asians who view their success as intimately connected to the broader region rather than their smaller home nations alone. While much attention is paid to President Xi Jinping's articulation of a ""China Dream,"" quietly an ""ASEAN Dream"" is also being born. Read more: ASEAN 'cornerstone' of Japan's Asian diplomacy . While obviously far from integrated in the ways the European Union is, ASEAN now has a momentum that Europe's regional project lacks. Despite their historical differences and rivalries, ASEAN countries have been pushing forward rapidly with cross-border investments, commercial integration, and intra-regional trade that has kept them growing fast -- averaging more than 5% -- even as the major export markets like Europe lose steam. With about 600 million people, ASEAN has only half of India's population but already a larger GDP. Research firm IHS projects that ASEAN's GDP will reach $4.7 trillion in 2020, not far off where Japan is today. Strategic location . ASEAN countries have strategic geography on their side as well. The region forms the crossroads of China and India, with deep infrastructural links re-emerging gradually through Myanmar. It is also the main conduit, via the Straits of Malacca, for most of the world's oil flows between the Near East and Far East. Now is the time for ASEAN to move from size to coherence. Over the past 50 years, Southeast Asia has experienced colonial liberation, the traumatic Vietnam War, internal rivalries between Indonesia and Malaysia, various forms of strongman rule, and diplomatic self-isolation through non-alignment. Today the region can be considered largely stable save for the simmering South China Sea dispute. This is ASEAN's chance to assert its collective voice, with American backing, vis-Ã -vis China and ensure that no single power dominates these crucial waters. The same applies to the issue of China's rampant upstream damming of the Mekong River, which threatens the stability of downstream flows on which ASEAN's heavily agricultural nations depend. Read more: ASEAN chief: South China risks becoming 'Asia's Palestine' Continued economic integration is also a strategic imperative. ASEAN is expected to launch an Economic Community (EAC) by 2015 that can either boost the region's growth potential or reveal deeper protectionist firewalls in both strong and weak economies. As much as Vietnam and Thailand stand to gain from even greater access to Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, a community worth its name needs a vision to help develop its poorest members. The top priority both to promote integration and assist weaker ASEAN nations must be infrastructure investment. Besides Singapore, which has already become a first world city-state, only Vietnam and Malaysia have significantly invested in nationwide infrastructure. Coupled with significant political and regulatory reforms, their second wave is under way. Other major ASEAN countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines are finally ramping up in terms of allocating greater shares of the national budget and overall GDP to infrastructure. Crucial gateway . Far too often flooding and other mishaps take critical sectors of their economies offline. Indonesia is now focused on roads, Thailand on railways, and the Philippines on ports. If they execute on these critical projects, the current growth rates will be far more resilient in the years ahead. Furthermore, with their high savings rates, dynamic private sectors, and growing interest from international markets, much more indigenous and foreign capital can be allocated towards public-private investment pools that can finance long-term infrastructure needs. We should remember that ASEAN's integration and development is as fundamentally a social as an economic or political issue. Around the world, urbanization is bringing never-before-imagined opportunities to more than 50 million people per year who move into cities -- but it has also exacerbated inequality, fueling unrest from Sao Paulo to Istanbul. For inclusive growth to occur, urbanization must be strategically conceived as a vehicle for employing -- and training -- tens of millions of youth in construction, hospitality, healthcare, education, and other services. Furthermore, the large rural poor populations of Myanmar, Cambodia and Indonesia need the basic health and education systems, as well as more advanced agricultural equipment that open borders can bring. For decades ASEAN has been thought of as a second-tier regional body. Now it has a chance to be the crucial gateway between powerful regions, a network of sustainable cities, and a thriving pillar of the century of Asia.","ASEAN economies have been growing at an average of more than 5%, Parag Khanna says .

"(CNN) -- At least 49 inmates broke out of a prison in Tunisia on Sunday night, the country's state-run Tunis Afrique Presse reported. Security forces have detained 13 of the escapees, according to the report, which cited a security source. The incident occurred in Gabes, in the southeastern part of the North African country. It is the latest mass prison break in the turbulent Muslim world. Recent prison breaks have been cited by analysts as one of several reasons the United States heightened its security and closed various embassies last month. Prison breaks occurred last July in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya, and have been a known strategy of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Details are not known about who escaped from the Tunisian prison, but there are longstanding fears that militants are focusing on springing their fighters and leaders who are incarcerated. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said that al Qaeda ""actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults, a couple of which have been quite successful."" Interpol last month issued a global security alert, asking member nations to help determine whether the recent escapes are linked. It cited ""suspected al Qaeda involvement in several of the breakouts which led to the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals.""","Thirteen of the escapees in Tunisia have been detained .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the Senate this week casts its first round of votes on immigration reform, a divided Republican conference on the other side of the Capitol may be a roadblock to any immigration measure passing Congress this year. And that internal split will soon pose a critical test for House Speaker John Boehner. One side of the divide was clear during a closed meeting last week among House and Senate conservatives -- the first time they've sat down to talk about a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. Immigration reform clears key Senate hurdle . Two of the Senate's GOP ""Gang of Eight"" members -- Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona, who are pushing the Senate's bipartisan plan -- faced off with well over 100 Republican members of the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC). Rubio is considered key to bringing conservatives on board, and Flake used to be a member of the RSC. Navarrette: Rubio's wild immigration ride . The meeting only seemed to harden conservative opposition. Rubio distances self from immigration plan he helped draft . Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks summed up the reaction of many House GOP members who attended the session, telling CNN those senators explaining the merits of that plan ""were doing their best to put lipstick on a pig."" Georgia Rep. Tom Price, a leading conservative, told reporters it was ""highly unlikely"" the majority of House Republicans would vote for a bill similar to the Senate deal that permits citizenship after a series of conditions are met because he and GOP colleagues don't trust the Obama administration to enforce the laws currently on the books. Ayotte backs Gang of Eight immigration plan . Bipartisan House plan on the rocks . While many House conservatives agree immigration reform is a critical priority for Congress, they part with President Barack Obama, Senate Democrats, and some in their own party who believe allowing eventual citizenship to those in the country illegally is part of the solution. They vow that they won't support any bill that adds to the deficit and they want to see a tougher approach to border security. 5 things you should know about immigration reform . But there is a bloc of House GOP members -- including 2012 vice presidential candidate Rep Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- that is pushing for a similar bipartisan approach that the Senate is taking up this week, which includes a path to citizenship. The group represents a minority within the House GOP conference. That bipartisan effort suffered a significant setback last week. A working group, similar to the Senate's ""Gang of Eight,"" has been on the verge of unveiling legislation for months, according to multiple sources. But Rep. Raul Labrador, one of the four GOP members in the group, abruptly dropped out. Like Rubio, who is needed to attract Republican votes in the Senate, reform backers hoped Labrador would play the same role in the House. Labrador was frustrated he couldn't get support for his detailed proposal laying out how undocumented workers in the U.S. would be barred from any taxpayer-funded health care benefits. Labrador leaves House bipartisan immigration group . Labrador told CNN his decision to leave the group and Rubio's call to add tougher border security measures to the Senate bill ""means maybe what we'll get is real immigration reform with conservative ideals that most Americans want."" Bipartisan House immigration talks foundering . Florida Rep Mario Diaz-Balart, who is still part of the group and has been involved in immigration negotiations for more four years, tried to downplay Labrador's exit, praising him and saying ""this has always been a very difficult issue,"" and said he remained committed to pushing ahead. Boehner repeatedly stresses that he supports the work of the House bipartisan group, but he won't weigh in on any policy details. He has vowed any legislation would follow ""regular order,"" meaning any bill will go through committees. 'A special path to citizenship is very problematic' After backlash from many of his rank and file members for cutting ""backroom deals"" on the debt ceiling and other issues, the Speaker wants time to educate his members on immigration reform and gain some buy-in for any bill or set of bills. That approach means House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia will wield significant power in the coming weeks. Goodlatte disagrees with the Senate Democrats' strategy to move one comprehensive bill, saying he prefers to move a series of discrete immigration measures through his committee. Goodlatte has focused his attention on the border security and employer verification aspects of reform and told reporters he has major concerns with moving legislation that sets up a process eventually allowing those already in the U.S. illegally to become citizens. ""A special path to citizenship is very problematic"" Goodlatte said. Obama: No one will get everything in immigration reform . Given the internal divisions Boehner has been careful not to signal whether he will move immigration in one package or allow votes on separate bills. But the Speaker appears to be prodding his members to get moving. He told reporters at his weekly news conference last week he expected the Judiciary panel to have ""some vehicles"" to move by the end of the month. Reform advocates worry that if the House breaks up any comprehensive bill and moves it in pieces it could kill momentum for immigration this year, but the process is important so that Boehner can say the House has input and Democrats are open to different options. When immigration efforts shift to the House it's notable that the political dynamic is much different that it is in the Senate. After Latinos went overwhelmingly for Obama in the 2012 election, many Republicans conceded the party needed to soften its stance and back legalization for undocumented workers this year to attract more Latino support. Many Senate Republicans feel pressure in states with high Hispanic populations to reverse their previous opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, or else suffer major losses among minority voters. But House districts have become more solidly red and blue after redistricting so there is less concern among most House Republicans that opposing immigration reform would hurt their chances at re-election. If the Senate passes legislation with a significant bipartisan vote there will be intense pressure on Boehner to act. He and other top House GOP leaders recognize passing major immigration legislation helps their party's long-term electoral prospects and could be a major issue in recapturing the White House in 2016. But the Speaker risks antagonizing many of his members by proceeding with a bill that would ultimately need a majority of Democratic votes to pass. How Boehner decides to proceed with immigration in the House could affect his political fortunes. Brooks gave a warning to Boehner as he considers the next step, telling CNN, ""If the Speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in the passage despite a majority of the Republican conference voting against it, then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election.""","Conservatives oppose any plan with path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants .
Boehner could be straddling divide if Senate passes bipartisan immigration bill .
House Conservatives see no pressure to pass bill because of they represent solidly red districts .
Boehner's future threatened if he allows vote on bill that conservatives will reject ."
"Jinan, China (CNN) -- Fallen Chinese Communist Party heavyweight Bo Xilai kept up his vigorous defense against corruption charges Friday in China's most politically sensitive trial in decades. Bo's glittering career, in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery. His high profile and connections among the nation's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for Chinese authorities. It's taken more than a year, during which time the Communist Party underwent a major leadership change, to bring him to trial. Timeline: Bo's fall from grace . Many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a preplanned script, seeing the trial's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between Bo and China's top leaders. But as he often did in his political career, Bo has so far stolen the show, mounting a robust attack on the prosecution's case and ridiculing witnesses' testimony. That has left China watchers trying to figure out how far he's veered off script. Bo calls wife 'insane' He began his counterattack after the trial opened Thursday amid tight security in the eastern city of Jinan. He said he had made an earlier confession to party investigators ""unwillingly"" and described testimony by a former associate as ""an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul."" He continued his offensive Friday, calling his imprisoned wife ""insane"" after the court was shown video testimony in which she implicated him in a murky property deal in the South of France. Bo, 64, is on trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. Journalists from the international news media haven't been allowed inside the courtroom. But the court's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside, attracting more than 350,000 followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. CNN hasn't been able to verify precisely how accurate and comprehensive the court's version of proceedings has been. But many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close, albeit filtered, account. Court adjourned for the day Friday and will resume at 8:30 a.m. Saturday. An 'eloquent' defense . ""In my view, Bo Xilai has decided not to cooperate, but not completely. Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems,"" said Cheng Li, a China expert at the Brookings Institution. The prosecutors were ""terrible,"" Li said, while Bo was ""clear, focused, articulate and eloquent."" His courtroom display appears to have been striking enough to prompt a personal attack against him on the website of the People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper. ""Bo Xilai's righteous and forceful performance in court makes one marvel at his superb acting and lying skills,"" the op-ed article said, citing an unidentified ""media personality who attended the trial."" ""His cunning arguments are only going to prove his extremely poor character and not going to help him evade punishment under law,"" the article quoted the person as saying. Conviction still seen as likely . Although the effectiveness of Bo's performance so far doesn't mean the court will acquit him, it may make it tougher for it to mete out a heavy sentence. The conviction rate for criminal trials and their appeals in China -- where the party controls police, prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report cited the Supreme People's Court as saying. ""Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous,"" Li said. ""But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charge and how poorly they've conducted this trial."" It remains to be seen if the prosecutors' performance improves as the case continues. China leaves nothing to chance for Bo Xilai 'trial of the century' Flaws revealed . Much of the fallout from the Bo scandal came before the trial opened. ""The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse,"" Li said. Members of the Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping, have described corruption as an existential threat to the Communist Party. But they have so far been reluctant to pursue it too aggressively. Analysts say that is largely because it is so rampant. Bo's case might have been a chance to make an example of a senior official. But his trial so far suggests that top leaders are unwilling to delve too deeply or punish him too severely. ""The leadership wants to move forward. They want to put it behind them and move onto other issues,"" Li said. ""That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system."" A dramatic downfall . Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Mao Zedong and former leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policymaking body of the Communist Party. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February of last year and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was an accomplice in a murder case, a glittering political career began to unravel. Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts. A court found Gu guilty last year of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in 2011. A family employee, Zhang Xiaojun, was also convicted in the killing and sentenced to nine years in prison. The following month, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Dispute over a villa . Bo's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal. Authorities haven't said how long it will last. But with only part of the charges addressed so far, it appears it could go on for longer than the two days some observers had predicted. Some of the testimony Friday concerned accusations that Bo was complicit in a complex deal Gu carried out to buy a villa in Cannes, France. A dispute over ownership of the villa resulted in a falling out with Heywood, Gu said. In her video testimony, Gu said that Bo was aware that the purchase of the villa had been funded by Xu Ming, a businessman in the northeastern port city of Dalian, where Bo was once mayor. But Bo contested her accusation that he knew how the villa was paid for and poured scorn on her reliability as a witness. ""What's the credibility of Gu Kailai's testimony? She has changed, she is insane, and she often tells lies,"" he said. ""She has been under severe pressure from the investigators to turn me in."" Three indictments . Under the bribery indictment, prosecutors accuse Bo of using his political posts to secure influence for others. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi ($3.6 million) in bribes from Xu and another Dalian businessman, Tang Xiaolin. The embezzlement charge alleges that Bo and Gu transferred 5 million renminbi of public money from a construction project in Dalian to a private account through a law firm in Beijing. And the abuse of power indictment relates to Bo's actions after he was informed about his wife's involvement in the killing of Heywood and Wang's attempted defection to the United States.

The former Communist Party chief of the sprawling southwestern metropolis of Chongqing has denied abusing his power -- the third and final charge being heard in court in Jinan, eastern China, long after he was stripped of his posts and expelled from the party. Prosecutors accuse Bo of threatening and improperly firing his former police chief Wang Lijun after learning about a murder investigation involving Bo's wife Gu Kailai, who is currently serving a suspended death sentence for killing British businessman Neil Heywood. On Sunday, Bo insisted that Wang was lying throughout his court appearance, and said his words lacked any credibility or legal standing. Wang took the witness stand Saturday, providing the first opportunity for the two former allies to confront each other since Wang's attempted defection to the United States in early February 2012. Analysis: How, why Chinese politician veered off script . Wang told the court he fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu because he feared for his safety following a tense encounter in Bo's office, just one day after Wang told Bo about his wife's suspected involvement in murder. ""He started verbally assaulting me... and about three minutes later, he walked around the left side of his desk and stood in front me. He suddenly attacked me with his fist, hitting on my left ear -- it was not just a slap,"" Wang recalled, according to a court transcript. On Sunday, Bo said: ""He said I didn't just slap him but punched him. I never practiced martial arts -- I don't possess such striking power,"" according to a transcript released by the Jinan Intermediate People's court. Bo added: ""After being convicted for abuse of power and defection, he still argued that he didn't defect but engaged in diplomacy in accordance with regulations. ""All this shows this man has extremely bad character and lies on the spot."" The trial was adjourned after the Sunday morning session and will resume Monday morning. During trial, Xilai keeps up his counterattack . The story behind the 'slap' On Saturday, Bo conceded he had made mistakes but denied he broke the law to protect his wife. ""I have made mistakes. I feel regret and I'm willing to take responsibility,"" Bo said. ""But whether or not I've committed a crime is a different issue."" ""I didn't bend the law to protect Gu Kailai,"" he said. ""I didn't force Wang Lijun out or force him to defect to the United States."" Bo did acknowledge slapping Wang in the face -- a key moment long considered a turning point in the two men's relationship -- during the office confrontation, claiming he believed Wang was trumping up charges against Gu and thus furious at his ""double-faced"" deputy who had faked his loyalty to the Bo family. According to a court transcript, Wang said it was more than a slap and that the blow had caused a ""discharge"" from his ear. ""My body shook a little... and I found blood at the corner of my mouth and discharge in my ear,"" he continued. ""I wiped the blood off with a tissue, but when he heard me calmly tell him again that he had to face the reality, he threw a glass on the ground while saying 'I'll never accept it.'"" Wang told prosecutors that Bo's physical violence against him as well as the disappearance of his aides and investigators led to his decision to seek refuge in the U.S. diplomatic mission in Chengdu. When Bo was allowed to question the witness, Wang revealed in an exchange that Gu had told him about her intention to kill a day before the murder. And when Bo asked Wang: ""Did you think I was forcing you out in an attempt to cover up (my wife's murder) case?"" Wang replied: ""Yes."" The trial by social media . Embezzlement and corruption charges . Earlier Saturday, Bo kept up his vigorous defense against embezzlement charges and, as he did Friday on corruption charges, and dismissed testimony from his jailed wife as a desperate attempt to reduce her own sentencing. Gu was sentenced last August for killing Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in November 2011. She gave her testimony to the court via video and said that Bo was well aware of multi-million dollar dealings to fund their and their younger son's jet-setting lifestyle. ""I have feelings for Gu Kailai,"" Bo said Saturday morning, after admitting to an extramarital affair. ""She is a vulnerable woman... and who else could she turn in? That's why all accusations against me originated from her."" Prosecutors allege that Bo received five million renminbi ($820,000) of public funds from a local urban planning official in Dalian, Liaoning Province, in the early 2000s when he was mayor and later the provincial governor. Bo slammed the allegations as ""contradictory"" and denied that he needed to take the money as his wife earned millions of dollars from her five law firms. Under the bribery indictment, prosecutors accuse Bo of using his political posts to secure influence for others. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi ($3.6 million) in bribes from businessmen in Dalian. Bo Guagua hopes father can 'answer his critics' Bo's fall from grace . Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo -- with the help of Wang -- was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing. Bo's glittering career, in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, corruption and betrayal. Wang's attempted defection precipitated Bo's political demise. After Gu's sentencing last August, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Bo's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal. His high profile and connections among the nation's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for Chinese authorities. It's taken more than a year, during which time the Communist Party has undergone a major leadership change, to bring him to trial. Many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a pre-planned script, seeing the trial's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between Bo and China's top leaders. But as he often did in his political career, Bo has so far stolen the show, mounting a robust attack on the prosecution's case and ridiculing witness testimony. That has left China watchers trying to figure out how far he's veered off script. Journalists from the international news media haven't been allowed inside the courtroom. But the court's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside, attracting more than half a million followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. CNN hasn't been able to verify how accurate and comprehensive the court's version of proceedings has been. But many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close, albeit filtered, account.

"(CNN) -- It was a rare bright spot on an otherwise hazy, smoke-filled horizon. An evacuation advisory was lifted Thursday for residents in Tuolumne City, a picturesque community in northern California threatened by an historic wildfire, as firefighters worked to get a grip on the blaze. Known as the Rim Fire, the conflagration has charred nearly 200,000 acres, cost the state more than $39 million to date and is threatening 5,500 structures, of which 4,500 are residences. It's the sixth-largest wildfire in California history. On Thursday, it was in its 12th day and it had only been contained 32%, according to Cal Fire. Because of the approaching flames, officials have shut down electricity generators, and San Francisco -- more than 120 miles to the west -- temporarily is getting power from elsewhere. While the Yosemite Conservancy says the Rim Fire has consumed tens of thousands of acres inside Yosemite National Park, it has so far had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the park's iconic attractions, including the El Capitan rock formation. Firefighters hope to keep it that way. Nearly 5,000 people have been assigned to the blaze. ""This is going to be a tough fire,"" said Tom Tidwell, chief of the U.S. Forest Service. ""It's going to continue for a few more weeks."" 'It looked like a thunderhead cloud, but it was smoke' The blaze has created challenges not only to firefighters and utility providers, but also to people who were in the park on long-planned explorations and expeditions. That group included people such as David Hermanson and his friends. They were on a 10-day trek through the wilderness, just four guys and six llamas. Expecting to commune with nature, they instead faced its sheer, raw power when their hike was cut short by the huge wildfire ravaging northern California. Hermanson, a 30-year-old artist and air conditioner repairman from the San Diego area, knows Yosemite National Park like the back of his hand. ""Me and my dad have been hiking Yosemite every year since I was seven,"" he said. Stoked to be back in the park again, Hermanson and three of his buddies loaded up the llamas and embarked August 20 on what was to have been a 60-mile hike from Leavitt Meadows to Lake Eleanor. The group was at Dorothy Lake -- about halfway into their trip -- when clouds started to roll in. At least that's what they seemed to be. ""It looked like a thunderhead cloud, but it was smoke,"" Hermanson said. ""It was just amazing. It looked surreal."" Wildfire threatens 90-year-old cabin . Time to turn around . Hermanson used a satellite phone to call his dad, who kept the group apprised as the wildfire gobbled up acres by the thousands. ""It was pretty bad in the evening,"" Hermanson said. ""You couldn't see the other side of the lake, the visibility was maybe 100 yards."" Dad said it was time to turn around. The fire was spreading to the end of the trail. ""We didn't feel endangered,"" a disappointed Hermanson said. ""We were just engulfed with smoke. It seemed like the smoke got worse as it progressed."" What you need to know about wildfires . 'A lot of work to be done' Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation. ""There's a lot of concern, and there's a lot of work to be done,"" U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley said. Firefighters have been able to build fire lines in several locations, officials say. The forecast is looking favorable as daytime highs sink into the 70s over the Labor Day weekend, a break from the temperatures in the high 80s firefighters were facing Wednesday. More than 20 helicopters and air tankers were aiding the efforts. Truck burns . Herman says the group's decision to abort their hike was a good one. The rendezvous truck they had left at the end of the trail was nothing by a burnt shell after the fire roared through Lake Eleanor. The group made it out safely on Monday. Hermanson's dad provided the ride home for the crew. And the llamas? ""They were sneezing a lot. I think they may have been bothered by the smoke."" Yosemite fire: Blaze spreads to national park .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has confounded expectations by delivering a cool, considered denial of charges leveled against him during a keenly-anticipated corruption trial that has captivated China. So far, the public has heard more details of the case than many anticipated. Live tweets from the court house in Jinan, Shandong, are now being followed by more than 460,000 people and this number is expected to rise. After the first full day of testimony, CNN asked prominent China analyst Cheng Li, from the Brookings Institution in Washington, for his thoughts on how and why the trial has veered so dramatically off-script. CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case. What has been the most surprising twist? Cheng Li: There were two surprises. One is that Bo has rejected all allegations so far, and said he ""unwillingly"" accepted the charge when he was being questioned by the central disciplinary commission investigation team. The second surprise is that the prosecution has performed very poorly in trying to make a strong case against him; it seems to be falling apart. All of a sudden, in my view, Bo has decided not to cooperate, but not completely. Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most. CNN: Did Bo and his legal team wrong-foot the leadership? Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable. If you reviewed his career he always surprised people. He has always played the wildcard. It will be the authorities' problem if they didn't prepare for that. When you have a semi-open trial you need to prepare. There's a lot of praise in Chinese social media for the judge for his professional manner, but the prosecutors are terrible. Bo has rejected virtually everything in a very effective way. But that means even the leadership can't rely too much on the promises or deals made by Bo. CNN: Do you think a deal was done before the trial and does that appear to be unraveling? Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges. The deal is they dropped some of the most severe charges against him. If you look at September 28 when they arrested him and expelled him from the Communist Party -- there were about six or seven charges, including obstruction of justice and womanizing and, probably most importantly, during the investigation of the murder of Neil Heywood they allegedly found some other criminal activities. In July, they put forward only three charges: Bribery, corruption and abuse of power. CNN: What's the problem for the leadership strategy to focus on corruption? Bo was the wrong person to focus on corruption because he was famous for being anti-corruption during his tenure in Chongqing. And relatively speaking, at least in people's perception, he's not that corrupted. He made a lot of people nervous about his self-promotion campaign -- that's the real reason, not about corruption. Bo Xilai's real ambition is not about the money. He wants to be a top leader, or the top leader. By that time the whole country would be his. That's the fundamental dilemma for the leadership. Now the leadership is in an awkward position -- the charges of corruption will not resonate too well and they can't go back to the other charges. So what kind of verdict will they give him? Certainly it will not be too severe. If it's too lenient they'll receive other serious criticism so it's really a no-win situation for the leadership. CNN: What do you think the reaction will be in the leadership after this ""change of script""? Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him. In my view he was clear, focused, articulate and eloquent. Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did. I think the authorities' case is not in good shape on day one. CNN: Has the leadership's tactic backfired? Could Bo have gained more support than he's lost in the past 24 hours? Li: Absolutely. There are a lot of rumors that he was very emotional and out of control in jail. But he presented himself very well. He was very respectful, reasonable, had a human touch, he cared about Dalian, he cared about its people. He claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys. He made a clear cut with his wife; blamed many things on his wife, especially the things that he claimed he did not know. Also, his defense lawyer did an excellent job to use very clear language to undermine a lot of the accusations. Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise, in many ways. CNN: Did you find it surprising that he seemed to turn on his wife, Gu Kailai? Li: A line has been drawn. His defense lawyer kept emphasizing her unstable mental status and most of the people in China believe that. If you look at the pictures before her arrest and in the court, it looks like there's a problem. Of course the prosecution didn't buy that, but when people judge, at least the civilian people, they buy that argument. So Bo has successfully drawn a line between him and his wife and used it to undermine her testimony. CNN: There was a lot of talk when the scandal emerged -- and in subsequent months -- that the case would shake-up Chinese politics. Is it that the case, or will it be business as usual after the verdict? Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse. So this case already has a strong impact. In 18 months a lot has changed; there's been a leadership succession, Wen Jiabao's retirement, and the princelings have consolidated their power. The leadership wants to move forward. They want to put it behind them and move onto other issues. That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system. CNN: Given the apparent troubled nature of the prosecution's case, is there any chance Bo could be in the 0.1% of Chinese suspects not convicted at trial? Li: Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous. But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they've conducted this trial. So there are difficulties for the prosecution unless there are dramatic twists and turns in the following days. I think certainly the sentencing won't be the death penalty, probably not even the death penalty commuted to life. The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years.","China expert Cheng Li: Bo Xilai trial takes number of surprising turns .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray became the first member of the so-called Big Four in men's tennis to flinch at the U.S. Open. He lost a set to Argentina's Leonardo Mayer on Friday. But the defending men's champion in New York had an easier time in sweltering conditions Sunday, dispatching German Florian Mayer 7-6 6-2 6-2 to move into the fourth round. Women's defending champion Serena Williams progressed, too, defeating Sloane Stephens 6-4 6-1 in a rematch of their thriller at the Australian Open. Even though Murray's serve wasn't fully firing, he didn't get broken and struck 42 winners -- double his unforced error count. It was especially impressive given Mayer's ability to throw off opponents with his change of pace and quirky forehand. Mayer, ranked as high as 18th and now the world No. 47, needed to claim the opening set to have a chance of upsetting the Scot. Once Murray took it in a tiebreak, and convincingly, Mayer's shoulders slumped and he proceeded to win four games the rest of the way. Murray was happy he didn't have to spend too long on court -- under two hours -- in the draining conditions. ""It cooled down a little bit towards the end but the first and second sets it was very hot,"" he said in an interview on court afterwards. ""It was very tough conditions and he's a very tricky opponent,"" Murray continued. ""He plays strange shots and he takes your time away. It's tough to get into a rhythm. ""I'm really glad to come through in three sets."" Murray's next foe is Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin, who topped steady Italian Andreas Seppi in five sets. Looking further ahead, Murray could meet the dangerous Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals and the Czech had an even easier time than Murray on Sunday. Berdych conceded a mere five games to Frenchman Julien Benneteau. The 31-year-old Williams, bidding to become the oldest U.S. Open women's winner in the Open era, captured eight of the last nine games to see off Stephens and book a spot in the quarterfinals. Stephens sent Williams packing in the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, although the latter was injured in the match, and some regard the 20-year-old as the future of American tennis. The pair were friends, fell out when Stephens criticized Williams but are now back on good terms. Williams next plays Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro, who upset Germany's Angelique Kerber in a third-set tiebreak.","Andy Murray beats Germany's Florian Mayer to reach the fourth round at the U.S. Open .

"London (CNN) -- The British Wildlife Photography Awards 2013 are celebrating the beauty of Great Britain's nature. A photo of a dolphin surfing in the waves off Northern Ireland is this year's overall winner. Titled ""In the Living Room,"" it was taken by photographer George Karbus, a Czech photographer who is based in Ireland. Karbus was diving with his camera off the coast in Northern Ireland when he spotted a bottlenose dolphin. ""I've had quite a few encounters with dolphins there before but that day I was just looking to capture some underwater rolling barrel shots when I got a present of this incredibly playful dolphin, which joined me for some underwater body surfing for a few waves and then left,"" he said of the winning picture. ""My favorite place on Earth is Ireland,"" he said. ""After nine years of living here I still get amazed by its coastal beauty and everything it has to offer."" Other pictures include owl chicks peeking out of a tree hole, tiny fungi in front of massive trees, eerie underwater world inhabitants, and a deer in a housing estate. The photographs are exhibited at The Mall Galleries in London until September 7. A book featuring all images from the awards will be published later in September. The British Wildlife Photography Awards were established four years ago to recognize the talents of wildlife photographers working in Britain and raise awareness for the country's biodiversity and habitats.","British Wildlife Photography Awards showcase nature's beauty .

"(CNN) -- For millions in the United States, daily activities like going to work or school are accompanied by bothersome gastrointestinal problems, such as abdominal pain or constipation. You may think these symptoms are too embarrassing to discuss with anyone. But trust me, these are common problems, and you your doctor wants to hear about them! It's important to be candid with your physician about all your GI symptoms and how frequently they are occurring. You may have a chronic GI disorder such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or celiac disease. Or you may have a functional bowel disorder; two of the most common are irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). What are IBS-C and CIC? IBS-C is one of the four major subtypes of IBS, a chronic functional GI disorder that arises from an abnormal functioning of the GI tract, not from structural or biochemical abnormalities. Symptoms of IBS-C include abdominal pain or discomfort, hard and infrequent stools, and incomplete bowel movements. The cause of IBS-C is not known, but it may be related to a number of factors such as hypersensitivity of nerves in the intestines, dysfunction of brain-gut communication, or altered GI tract motility and water imbalance. CIC has similar symptoms, such as hard stools, and infrequent and incomplete bowel movements, but is usually not associated with pain. Although ""idiopathic"" means the cause is unknown, potential factors may include changes in water balance and motility in the colon. Who is affected by the conditions? Though estimates vary, as many as 13 million adults in the United States may suffer from IBS-C; 35 million adults may suffer from CIC. How are IBS-C and CIC treated? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis and treatment is to have an open conversation with a physician, telling him or her how you feel. Let the physician know the details of any symptoms you experience, how often and what you've tried in the past to help alleviate them. There is no cure for IBS-C or CIC, but there are ways to help manage symptoms: . Change your diet. Increasing fiber in your diet may help create softer stools that are easier to pass. Try eating more foods that are high in fiber, including fruits, vegetables, beans and bran flakes. Be careful to add fiber to your diet slowly to reduce the risk of gas and bloating. Avoid fatty foods, alcohol and caffeinated drinks like coffee or soda, which are commonly known to worsen symptoms. In addition, some people with IBS may have intolerances to certain sugars such as fructose or lactose. Limiting intake of foods containing these sugars may be helpful. Drink plenty of water. Drinking six to eight glasses of water per day is important to stay hydrated, which may help pass stools more easily. Increase exercise, reduce stress. Stress and anxiety can trigger symptoms of several GI conditions. Increasing exercise like walking or yoga, and learning relaxation techniques may help you deal with stressful situations. However, be sure to talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. For some, changing diet and lifestyle may not be enough. Physicians may also recommend appropriate treatment options for patients based on the nature and severity of their IBS-C and CIC symptoms. It's important that patients inform their physician about treatments that have or have not worked for them in the past. Over-the-counter products. OTC treatment options such as laxatives and stool softeners are available and approved to treat occasional constipation. These products are not intended for long-term use without supervision of a physician and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for IBS-C or CIC treatment. Prescription medication. There are prescription medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of IBS-C and CIC. GI health should be a part of your daily life. I encourage patients to speak to their doctor about their symptoms, sparing none of the nitty-gritty details.","As many as 13 million adults in the United States may suffer from IBS-C .

"Washington (CNN) -- A new rule requiring airlines to include government taxes and fees in their advertised price is continuing to cause turbulence in the travel industry -- and a congressman said Monday he'll introduce a bill to overturn it. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Georgia, said Monday he will introduce a bill to cancel the U.S. Department of Transportation rule, which took effect last week. The rule requires airlines to roll mandatory per-passenger taxes and fees into the advertised fare, but allows them to break down the costs elsewhere in the advertisement. Before the rule, airlines frequently advertised low base fares on online sites and added taxes and fees later in the shopping process. The DOT and some consumer advocates argued the airlines were hiding the true cost of air travel. But Graves and some airlines said the new rule allows the government to hide government taxes and fees. ""If the American people can't see these costs clearly, I fear it will be easier (for) these fees and taxes to be raised without their knowledge,"" Graves said in a statement. ""If the goal of the DOT's rule is to prevent companies from deceiving passengers about the total cost of their ticket, why is the department mandating that airlines hide the taxes, surcharges and government fees in the fine print?"" Graves said. ""Transparency and honesty in ticket pricing should apply across the board."" The clash between the DOT, the airlines, consumer groups and others has been loud and brash. Spirit Airlines has configured its website with a big ""Warning!"" pop-up sign. The message: ""New government regulations require us to HIDE taxes in your fares. This is not consumer friendly or in your best interest. It's wrong and you shouldn't stand for it."" The DOT's top lawyer responded with a letter calling the ad campaign ""misguided and disingenuous."" ""Contrary to its direct assertion that the rule requires airlines to hide the amount of government taxes and fees, the rule does not prevent carriers from disclosing the amount, type, and nature of government taxes and fees that are associated with air travel,"" DOT General Counsel Robert Rivkin wrote. ""Carriers are free to describe the components of the full price, including government taxes, so long as the description is not deceptive,"" he wrote. The move to introduce legislation was commended by Airlines for America, the trade organization that represents the major U.S. airlines. ""We support this effort to require DOT to return to its previous regulation, which does not artificially distort the base price of an airline ticket, and ensures that customers always know exactly how much they are paying in federal aviation taxes and fees before they decide to purchase,"" said Steve Lott, vice president of communications for Airlines for America said in an e-mail. ""Federal taxes and fees now constitute $61, or over 20%, of the cost of a typical $300 domestic round-trip ticket, putting aviation at a higher tax rate than alcohol, beer, cigarettes and firearms."" CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","As of last week, airlines must highlight total fare, including fees and taxes .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- One of the most dramatic developments from the trial of disgraced senior politician Bo Xilai isn't what was said in court, but that the arguments were revealed at all. The public received updates released on social media -- a first in a country where most court proceedings are held in secret and the outcome far from doubt. While official state media has given cursory coverage to the trial, Chinese netizens fed an online frenzy of commentary about the case, which was the top trending topic Thursday on Sina.com's Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like microblogging site. ""The live coverage of Bo's case on Jinan Intermediate Court's Weibo feeds is awesome and a huge progress for media coverage on trials!"" wrote Weibo writer Youyoulaihaiyouqu. Followers of the Jinan court's Weibo account jumped from less than 10,000 on Wednesday to more than 330,000 by Friday morning as the court fed updates of the bribery case against Bo, whose downfall last year was laced with tales of murder and corruption, creating the Communist Party's biggest political crisis in decades. ""While it's difficult to say whether Beijing censored the material -- foreign journalists were not allowed inside to cover the trial, so it's unclear how closely the official remarks hewed to what actually went down in the courtroom -- it is certainly China's first live-microblogged show trial,"" noted Isaac Stone Fish in Foreign Policy. Once heir apparent for a place at the top of China's political elite, Bo is on trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. His wife, Gu Kailai, was convicted last year of murdering a British businessman in a case that began Bo's downfall. On Thursday, Bo gave a spirited defense against the bribery charges -- which in itself surprised observers. According to posts by the court, Bo contested the claim that he had taken bribes from Tang Xiaolin, a businessman in the northeastern industrial city of Dalian, where Bo used to be mayor. After watching a video in which Tang detailed how he sent Bo money, Bo remarked, ""I saw an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul,"" the court said. There were two surprising elements from the dispatches Thursday from the court, according to Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution. The first was that Bo has dared to reject the allegations against him, and the poor performance of the prosecution which Li described as ""terrible."" He said any deal that had been done before the trial appears to be unraveling. ""All of a sudden, in my view, Bo Xilai has decided not to co-operate, but not completely. Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most,"" Li said. While official state media offered little commentary on the proceedings, Chinese netizens weren't afraid to wade in. ""After reading the whole transcript of the trial, I realized that the prosecutors actually failed to offer direct proofs of Bo taking bribes. Instead, they talked a bunch of issues that don't really have much to do with the accusations,"" wrote Yuxin. Shudongjunaishudong: ""Bo Xilai thought high of himself, abusing the power for personal gains and fooled the public. But he didn't know that those who misuse the power which granted by people will be severely punished according to the discipline of the Party and the law of the country."" Still, many supporters on Weibo applauded Bo's tenure as mayor of Chongqing, where he made his name as an anti-graft crusader. ""You (referring to Bo) will always remain a great secretary in the eyes of Chongqing people!"" wrote Suzui. Some heralded the live-blogged trial as turning a page for transparency in China; others wondered whether Bo's defense itself was blessed by the state, as evidenced by the court's release of his statements. But the court's feverish stream of dispatches on Thursday had slowed significantly on Friday, adding to the belief that the outcome of the trial in China -- where only 0.1% of cases return a not guilty verdict -- is of little doubt. ""I never care about politics but I think it's worth following right now because of Bo Xilai, but I can tell the result has been scripted, now is only a process to make people think that our country is fair and transparent,"" wrote Xiao Kui Kui-Cindy.

"(CNN) -- Living amid the garbage-strewn sewage canals, residents of Haiti's Cite Soleil endure a grim battle for survival every single day. The shantytown in the northern reaches of capital Port-au-Prince is one of the countries poorest areas, blighted by poor sanitation and violence. Shacks, on average, house nine people and around half the population earn less than $0.50 a day. It's little wonder then that life expectancy isn't much more than 50 years, according to the healthcare NGO, Haiti Clinic. But one man is hoping to challenge this statistic, planting the seeds of a healthier future for the district's 250,000 population by transforming a garbage dump into a vibrant urban garden. ""Growing up in Cite Soleil we have the situation where people think it's somewhere nothing good can happen,"" says local resident Daniel Tillias. ""But myself and some members of the community wanted to have something to turn it green and nothing could be better than a garden."" The results are extraordinary. Jaden Tap Tap (Tap Tap Garden) covers half-an-acre and is the largest urban garden in the country. Teeming with plants and people planting and picking them, the garden is hugely popular with locals. ""We grow about 20 different vegetables in the garden,"" explains Tillias. Founded in 2011, the garden has an abundance of vegetables and herbs: eggplants, peppers, chard, radishes, potatoes, parsley, basil. It's a cornucopia of healthy green vegetables that rivals any community farm in the world. ""People get in mind that it's not possible to garden in Haiti -- the soil is no longer good, we don't have water. But you see we have accomplished something really amazing,"" says Tillias. The bulk of the produce is used for the local soup kitchen providing much needed nutrition for the community. Whatever is left is sold at market. It's not just the plants which catch your eye, but also the recycled pots and containers. Old tires, shoes, footballs are filled and planted. Even toilet bowls and old suitcases have been put to use. ""We use whatever we can find. The whole point is first we want the kids to feel connected with what seems like nothing much, because this is something that would just float in the canal. We say: 'No! It could grow parsley,'"" Tillias says. ""I want them to be able to eat, to make money out of the garden and to feel more peace through the garden. If I can see these three things happen, I would feel as if I had fulfilled my dream.""","Community garden project a symbol of hope for Haitian shantytown .

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- It was no ordinary football match Tuesday in the capital of Ghana, in West Africa. Partisan fans crowded the stands and players in colorful jerseys competed on the field at Accra Sports Stadium. One team was comprised of retired players from the Ghana Black Stars. The other team was unusual, made up of members of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC); the primary opposition party, the New Patriotic Party (NPP); and the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). The game was dubbed ""Peace Match 2013."" Its purpose: A show of unity, and a cooling of tensions, two days before the Ghanaian Supreme Court rules on a sweeping challenge to the December 2012 presidential election. The famously easy-going people of Ghana are on edge, awaiting Thursday's decision. The drama pits incumbent President John Dramani Mahama of the NDC against his main challenger, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of the NPP. The IEC declared Mahama the winner of the December 2012 presidential election with 50.7% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a runoff. He was sworn into office in January. The NDC has acknowledged there were some irregularities, but contends they were minimal. But Akufo-Addo and two other NPP officials sued, alleging widespread mismanagement and voting irregularities at more than 10,000 polling stations, and are asking the Supreme Court to annul millions of votes. The NPP maintains Akufo-Addo should have won the presidency. Analysts say the court has three choices: It could throw out all the NPP's election challenges and validate Mahama's election. It could uphold some or all of the NPP allegations, triggering a recount without the disputed votes and realigning the percentages, putting Mahama or Akufo-Addo in the presidency if one or the other tallies 50%+1 or more. Or it could call an entirely new election. No one seems ready to confidently predict what the court will do. Nine Supreme Court justices spent 48 days hearing the case, which has riveted the nation. The proceedings were broadcast live on Ghanian television and radio, the first time the court has allowed such broadcasts. They have been immensely popular. ""Ghanaians are very politically drunk,"" says MultiTV and Joy Radio presenter and Eastern region tribal chieftain Nana Ansah Kwao. ""We all thought it would be a two-week case. So when it started, everyone was glued to the tele and the radio and every dial was on the court."" Across the capital, calls for post-decision calm and national unity are on billboards, banners, across the airwaves and in published statements from both parties and a host of political and social groups. Mahama and Akufo-Addo were to meet to mutually call for calm and respect for the decision, whatever way it goes. Ghana is one of Africa's fastest-growing economies. It is the world's second-largest cocoa producer, after Ivory Coast, and the continent's second biggest gold miner, after South Africa, according to the United Nations. But critics say that despite the rich resources that bring billions of dollars annually, the wealth is not trickling down to the rural poor who live on the land where the gold is mined. Ghana has been largely free of election bloodshed . There is a lot at stake Thursday. In March 1957, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan European colony to declare independence from a colonial ruler, in its case, Britain. It endured four military coups in the first 14 years, after one of which, three former presidents were executed. Then, in the election of 2000, it had its first peaceful transfer of power between civilian presidents. The incumbent won a second term in 2004, but term limits prohibited him from seeking a third term in 2008. In that election, John Atta Mills of the NDC narrowly defeated Akufo-Addo. But Mills died in office last year, elevating his vice president, Mahama to the presidency. Last December, Mahama ran for a full term against Akufo-Addo, setting off the Supreme Court battle. The decision and how Ghanaians react to it is significant far beyond its borders. Unlike its neighbors, Ghana has held successful elections and power transfers since 1992 without descending into bloody chaos. Just next door, Ivory Coast's 2010 presidential election led to a bloody conflict that left some 3,000 people dead. In Mali, a coup last year opened an opportunity for Islamic insurgents to capture much of the north, leading to a French invasion. Sierra Leone and Liberia have had bloody civil wars. But Ghana has seen none of that violence, particularly in recent years. Although Ghana's 25 million people represent more than eight tribes and while predominently Christian, has more than 4 million Muslims, it has no history of partisan or religious violence. Experts credit Ghana's system of sending high school students to boarding schools in other parts of the country for their education, which exposes Ghanaians to other communities and cultures, for creating tolerance and cooperation. For many Ghanaians, the reaction to Thursday's ruling will test that. But most think the reaction will be peaceful. If that happens, Kwao says he hopes it will resonate across the continent. ""I think it would be an extremely good message and that all leaders should look at and by all means emulate,"" Kwao says, ""because as a continent I think we've done ourselves in too long, mostly because of political disagreement. So if we can take this to the Supreme Court and we can accept it, I think the other 52 or 53 nations should look up to it say this is the way forward."" There is one thing Kwao predicts with confidence. When the Supreme Court convenes on Thursday and the live nationwide television and radio broadcasts go on air, ""I think 98% of Ghanaians will be glued to it.""","Ghanaian Supreme Court set to rule on massive presidential election challenge .

"(CNN) -- In 2011, Yani Tseng surprised the world with a feat that neither Tiger Woods nor Jack Nickalus could accomplish. On August 1, aged 22, the Taiwanese became the youngest golfer to win five major championships. Nini, as her friends call her, has two Women's British Open, two LPGA Championship and one Kraft Nabisco Championship trophies in a special case set at her Lake Nona home, which she bought from her long-time idol Annika Sorenstam. In her first five seasons as an LPGA member she earned 15 titles, 10 of them between 2011 and 2012. Her accomplishments took her to the top of the Rolex Rankings and she stayed there until March 2013, when American Stacy Lewis ousted her. But those achievements must feel some way away with Tseng going through her least successful season since 2009. After leading women's golf for two years, Tseng sits 14th in the rankings. She has not won a single tournament since March 2012 and, for the first time since she joined the LPGA, she missed five cuts consecutively. ""I think when you played that well and you get to a certain level where you are above everybody else you feel you are flying so high,"" Gary Gilchrist, Tseng's swing coach since 2010, told CNN . ""Being No. 1 at a young age is very tough and you still have a lot to learn about yourself; suddenly you win two tournaments and bang you are No. 1 in the world."" Europe crushes U.S. to retain Solheim Cup . Tseng is one of the most committed players on the LPGA Tour. She knew that playing her best was not enough and so she perfected her English to have a better relationship with sponsors, media and fans. Her life seemed like a dream-come-true, but the truth, according to Gilchrist, is that she felt a little bit out of her comfort zone. ""As she kept on winning it was fine, then she started to struggle a little bit with her game because she felt like 'hey, being No. 1 is not all that is made out to be'. ""It is like you don't live your own life, you live the life according to being No. 1 in the world."" At last March's LPGA Founders Cup, Lewis was closer than ever to become the best golfer on the planet. ""It will be a good release for me,"" admitted Tseng when asked about the possibility of being usurped in the rankings. Five months after her revelation, Tseng is outside the Rolex Rankings top 10. From January to August 2013, she has earned $273,743. Two years ago, in that same period, she grabbed $1.7 million. Getting back to where she used to be will be a tough task. Especially since Inbee Park has taken the game to a whole new level, having won the first three majors of the season, something only Babe Zaharias had previously accomplished back in 1950. ""All she has to do is recommit and motivate herself to get to that level, she needs to go back to the things that made her be No. 1,"" said Gilchrist. That includes working in her personality. Gilchrist describes her as an ""outgoing, fun and true to herself"" kind of person, but she is an aggressive player. So, is this a mental or a technical issue? ""She's always had an unorthodox golf swing but she has won 22 times,"" answered Gilchrist. That means she has more titles than many golfers ever get in a lifetime, and she just needs to grab the U.S. Women's Open to complete the career grand slam. ""She is not scared of competing with anybody and finds new ways to challenge herself,"" Gilchrist said of his 24-year-old charge. The $64 million question is: can she come back? In 2011, Tiger Woods sat 52nd in the men's rankings, today he once again leads men's golf. ""You don't want to put too much pressure on her, you want to give her time to grow and learn,"" continued Gilchrist. ""This may be a difficult time for her but I think this is going to cause great growth in her. ""She has to go out there and be Yani. The more she can be Yani the better she is going to be. She plays with her heart, she has great determination.""","Yani Tseng is the youngest golfer in history to have won five majors .

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Among the fearless young men carving scars into the faces of towering waves, is the ""King of Surfing."" At 41, Kelly Slater is old enough to be the father of some of his competitors on the Surfing World Tour. But the 11-time world champion -- dubbed ""King Kelly"" -- is far from washed up. At a time when his friends are settled down with families, the original surfing pin-up boy is still scoring perfect 10s on the international circuit. ""Friends that were on tour with me 20 years ago, 10 years ago, are now family guys married with kids,"" he said. ""They say 'I can't believe you're still doing it, that you're looking for waves every day.' ""But I want to surf better tomorrow. I want to surf better in 10 years. When I'm 50 I want to be a better surfer than I am now -- for me it's a lifelong journey."" Rise to the top . For Slater, it's a journey that began as a child growing up in the surfing town of Cocoa Beach, in Florida. Aged 20 he became the youngest person to win the Surfing World Championship, smashing the record books again when he also became the oldest person to win the title at 39. Watch video: Looking for the perfect wave . Indeed, Slater is one of the few professional surfers to have transcended the niche sports magazines to the society pages, appearing in dozens of films and starring in hit 1990s TV show Baywatch. ""I wanted to be [the actor] Steve Martin when I was a kid. I wanted to be a comedian,"" said Slater. ""When I was eight or 10 years old I didn't know that I could have a career from surfing. There were pro surfers who were my heroes, but those guys weren't rich. They were just surfing and traveling and that's really been the goal my whole life."" Spiritual surfing . Surfing is more than a career for Slater -- it's a spiritual experience, providing solace and filling him with a sense of wonder at nature. ""Surfing is my religion, if I have one,"" he said. ""The barrel [the hollow of a breaking wave] is really the ultimate ride for any surfer. It's the eye of the storm. Some guys say it's like being in the womb. ""For me it's sort of like time slows down. You become hyper aware of a lot of different things -- the way the wave is breaking, timing, putting yourself in the right part of the barrel. It takes all of your mental capacity to do it just right."" Despite being one of the oldest competitors on the international circuit, Slater has lost none of the grace, skill and fearlessness that made him the most successful surfer in the history of the sport. He scored a perfect 10 for a jaw-dropping reverse flip at notoriously treacherous Bell's Beach in southern Australia last year. ""This section came at me, and I just launched myself, kind of a 'Hail Mary,'"" said Slater. ""I didn't know if I was going to land it, or if I was going to break my board, or if I was going to break an ankle."" Daredevils . But along with the thrills come huge dangers, with Slater admitting that many of his friends have drowned while surfing. ""It makes you think about what it's worth. But what's life worth? Life's worth experiences and it's worth the people in your life too,"" he said. ""I'm sure it's different once you have a partner in your life or kids -- maybe that one wave's not that important any more."" And as technology develops, the mega waves which decades ago surfers could only dream of riding, are now within reach. Today, thrill seekers are towed by jet ski into colossal waves that would once have been out of bounds. But the dangers are just as large, with surfers risking being pushed up to 15-meters below the water. ""Big waves are a whole different ball game,"" said Slater. ""You're riding a wave with an immense amount of speed and power, generally over 10 meters. On the face of the wave, obviously life and death thoughts start to happen."" Same ball game . Slater has been chasing waves his whole life. And you get the feeling his obsession with the water has little to do with the $3.5 million in prize money he's earned. ""The other day we were watching this dog chasing a ball, and I was like 'God wouldn't it be so great if you could do the same thing over and over and over again your whole life and it's still as fun?'"" he said. ""And I'm like: wait! That's what we do. We travel around the whole world just to do that. So waves for surfers are like balls for dogs. We're just constantly chasing them."" He may have been playing the same ball game over more than four decades, but when it comes to surfing, Slater's love is as deep as the ocean.","""King Kelly"" Slater is the most successful pro surfer in history .

"(CNN) -- What do you get when you combine a hotel and a boat? Inevitably, you get a boatel. Catering for those who seek the romance of the high-seas without sacrificing the creature-comforts of dry land, an increasing number of enterprising hoteliers are converting historic vessels into over-night stays. From old lifeboats to classic military ships, these are our top five. The American dream . For many new immigrants arriving in New York last century, the first glimpse of their new home would have been from the Ellis Island ferry. The 1907 Yankee Ferry was one such boat, shuttling passengers from the immigrant inspection station to the bustling American metropolis. Now the oldest ferry boat in the country has a permanent home moored on the Hudson River -- and a psychedelic new interior. Renovated by artists Richard and Victoria Mackenzie-Childs, the five-bedroom vessel features an eclectic collection of vintage furniture with carnival-esque flourishes. Floating beside a vegetable garden and with a family of chickens strutting on deck, the Yankee is a bohemian oasis overlooking the glittering Manhattan skyline. A real lifesaver . In her former life, the Harlingen Lifeboat Hotel worked for Britain's Royal National Lifeboat Institution between the 1950s and the 1970s. The handsome red and white wooden vessel, then christened Lilla Marras, carried out more than 100 rescue operations along the notoriously rough North Sea and saved 45 people from drowning. Today Lilla has a much gentler existence, permanently moored in the quiet fishing town of Harlingen in the northern Netherlands. The renovated 14-meter boat includes a double bedroom, dining room and two-person wooden bath. Fit for a queen . From Hollywood heartthrob Clark Gable to stalwart British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the who's-who of the 1930s chose to rest their heads on luxury liner, Queen Mary. Boasting five dining lounges, two cocktail bars, a swimming pool, ballroom, squash court, and even a small hospital, the whopping 310-meter cruise ship set a new benchmark in transatlantic travel when she was launched in 1936. During World War II, the historic vessel was stripped of her luxurious amenities and painted a camouflage gray as she transported more than 16,000 troops across the world. Fast forward to today and the Queen Mary has been restored to her former art deco glory, though her sailing days are long over. Instead, guests can stay in one of 314 original staterooms and nine suites, in her permanent home in Long Beach, Los Angeles. We all live in a silver submarine . History buffs can experience life as a World War II sailor -- without the combat -- aboard the historic USS Silversides submarine. The mighty military vessel sank 23 Japanese ships during the war, making her the third most prolific U.S. submarine of the time. No longer patrolling key enemy shipping routes, today the Silversides is moored in the Muskegon Channel, Michigan. The 95-meter vessel, popular with school groups, features 72 bunk beds, giving youngsters the chance to step back in time and dream of life as a wartime sailor. Guests can also take part in a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) design class, including lessons on building their own underwater robot. An adjoining museum also features artifacts from the Pearl Harbor attack and a 70-seater theater screening archival naval footage. Room with a view . Not all boatels have to float on water though. Perched on top of London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, this fantastical boat looks out over the city's River Thames, Big Ben and St. Paul's Cathedral. A Room for London is a one-bedroom installation intended to be a space for artists, writers and musicians, to stay for one night and create new works inspired by the great city rumbling beneath them. The building is based on the Roi des Belges, the riverboat that author Joseph Conrad sailed up the Congo in 1889, and later used as the inspiration behind his famous book Heart of Darkness. The modern reincarnation however, includes a crow's nest, octagonal library and a cabinet of visual curios. ""With its combination of painted wood and hand-worked gold and silver coated metals, it seems to echo the simplicity of a Japanese tea-hut or the rural haphazard quality of a midwestern farm building,"" said organizers.","Enterprising hoteliers are converting historic vessels into over-night stays .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to notable water attractions, the humble lake has a hard time keeping up with the swelling oceans, seas and rivers of this world. But for many a water-faring holidaymaker, these picturesque, calm and often overlooked expanses can offer an interesting -- even challenging -- alternative to the their more voluminous counterparts. Indeed, tourists wishing to combine a sailing holiday with other cultural and sightseeing activities may consider an inland boating getaway the perfect vacation solution. See also: The best tropical island sailing spots . So, with the big-lake holidaymaker and landlocked sailor in mind, we bring to you a selection of the world's most spectacular lakes tailored especially for the boating enthusiast. Lake Baikal . The deep Siberian hinterland may not seem like the most likely hotbed of adventure sailing activity. But it is here that Lake Baikal offers potent sailing challenges against the inspiring backdrop of one Russia's most treasured national parks. The largest and most biologically diverse lake in the world, Baikal hosts 45 islands and contains roughly one fifth of all freshwater on the earth's surface. Charter companies offer private yachts for hire, throwing in all manner of scuba and diving equipment for use during the summer months. As the winter temperatures drop below freezing however, diving gear may be swapped for fishing equipment and winter warms for on-board activities. These additions may come in handy in April 2013 when visitors will be able to attend the Baikal Ice Yachting Championships. Lake Garda . A tourist hot-spot since the days of the Roman Empire, Lake Garda is today one of Italy's premier water-sport destinations. Azure blue waters and strong winds mean the lake is an attractive base for many a professional sailor, while regattas and races, such as the popular Centomiglia and Intervela, attract crowds and competitors alike. See also: Incredible racing images from the sea . For those seeking a less competitive sailing getaway however, Lake Garda still offers plenty to see and do. Idyllic lakeside towns and water-sport resorts offer extensive cultural and adventure activities and the well preserved Grotte di Catullo ruins on the lake's southern shores provide a spectacular example of Italy's Roman past. The Netherlands . Barging, sailing or wind surfing; there's always something happening on Holland's bustling inland lakes. Could anything else really be expected from the small, low-lying country where nearly every town is accessible by water? The Frisian, de Kaag and Vecht Lakes all offer fantastic sailing, swimming, rowing, water-skiing and surfing facilities. In the summer months, regattas and boat races are also a common site here and all along the country's nearby North Sea Coast. A jaunt along Hollands extensive canal system meanwhile enables sailors to venture further towards the country's cities and pretty interior. Lake Titicaca . Straddling the border region between Bolivia and Peru, Lake Titicaca is the second biggest lake in South America. At more than 12,000 feet above sea level in the Andean mountain range, it is also one of the highest navigable lakes in the world. Tour operators have long offered Titicaca boat trips and cruises but a number of companies now charter yachts and catamarans. See also: Charter a superyacht like a billionaire . Visitors to the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca can stop of at the mystical Isla del Sol (Island of the sun) and Isla del Luna (Island of the moon), taking in spectacular vistas of the surrounding lake. The ancient ruins of Inca towns and villages can also be found on these islands, enabling the archaeologically inclined to drop anchor and explore. Lake Geneva . Part Swiss, part French (where it is known as Lac Leman), Lake Geneva is the largest of Europe's Alpine lakes. Sailing and yacht clubs for boating enthusiasts abound, but there are also water-borne activities for beginners and thrill seekers. Numerous sailing schools cater for children and first-timers while the more confident can try their hands at water-skiing. Those looking to experience the beauty of the lake at their own pace can cruise the 46 mile long on stretch of water stopping of to sample the delights of picturesque towns such as Montreux along the way. Summer visitors meanwhile can catch a glimpse of the Bol d'Or Mirabaud, one of the most important inland races in the world. Where did we miss?

"(CNN) -- As a gung-ho supervisor, Stephen Jackson was so adept at finding and photographing sleeping airport security guards that colleagues called him the ""Nighttime Ninja,"" he says. Now the 38-year-old former U.S. Marine says he has been fired in retaliation for repeatedly bringing attention to the sleeping habits of subordinates who were supposed to be protecting New York's JFK Airport. Jackson said he reported to his bosses about a half-dozen instances in which guards fell asleep on post during his six months at the airport. But he says his employer -- FJC Security Services -- only took action in one case, suspending a guard who he had documented twice falling asleep. ""At JFK, they didn't want to know about it. They didn't want to deal with it,"" said Jackson. ""I was told that, 'Listen, You fly under the radar here. You don't have to be so gung-ho.'"" Jackson this week provided the New York Post and CNN with photographs that he says show security guards asleep at JFK posts. An official with FJC Security, which provides security for JFK, painted Jackson as a disgruntled employee who released the photos to damage the company after he was fired for misconduct. FJC vice president and chief security officer Matt Horace said the photos were ""never brought to the attention of FJC. Had he taken the proper steps as supervisor, those employees would have gone through the proper steps up to and including termination."" FJC provides security under a contract with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, operators of JFK. #Avgeeks: The new warriors on terror at the airport . While the Transportation Security Administration provides the high-profile job of screening passengers and baggage, airports are responsible for providing perimeter security under plans that undergo TSA scrutiny and approval. Most large airports contract with private firms for that security work. Jackson, of Staten Island, said he informed supervisors about sleeping guards and showed them photos. But he says he met resistance. ""My complaints fell on deaf ears, or at least somebody who didn't want to be bothered,"" he said. Jackson said FJC responded differently if sleeping guards were discovered by the Port Authority or by other FJC officials. Those discovered by the Port Authority were fired, he said, while those discovered internally were not. In May, a TSA inspector ""found one of our guards sleeping"" at the airport's ""H post"" -- an access point to an airport operations area -- and reported it to the company, Jackson said. But the company ""made no issue of it,"" he said. A TSA official said the validity of that claim could not be immediately determined. The Port Authority on Monday said it ""immediately directed FJC to permanently remove from Port Authority premises the guards shown sleeping in photos and/or on video as well as any other guards caught sleeping at our facilities."" ""The Port Authority will not tolerate unacceptable performance from its vendors,"" the statement said. Jackson was fired May 28 for ""gross misconduct and security infractions,"" the FJC's Horace said. Jackson allowed an off-duty guard to photocopy log entrees. ""When we became aware of it, an investigation was pursued and Mr. Jackson was terminated."" Jackson told CNN the guard was a union shop steward and that he and another supervisor ""challenged"" him. But Jackson said they were told the steward had permission and that he reported it ""about an hour or so after the fact."" ""They suspended the other manager and fired me,"" Jackson said.","Stephen Jackson says he was fired for exposing guards sleeping at JFK airport .

"(CNN) -- In 1916, British polar explorer Ernest Shackleton managed to save his entire crew after they had been stranded in the Antarctic for almost two years. Now, nearly a century later, Australian explorer Tim Jarvis and his team of five adventurers have set sail Thursday on a voyage to emulate Shackleton's epic survival journey, using almost exactly the same equipment and rations. During the original, grandly titled ""Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition"", Shackleton had attempted to cross the Antarctic and reach the South Pole with a crew of 27 men on his ship, the Endurance. But, after little more than a month, temperatures dropped so dramatically that the ship froze solid in the ice and eventually sunk. So began the long mission to survive, culminating in what is regarded by many to be one of the most astonishing rescue journeys in history. After abandoning ship and finding land on the inhospitable and remote Elephant Island, Shackleton set out with just five of his men in a small open lifeboat to seek help for the rest of his crew. Braving 20 meter-high waves, they rowed for two weeks across 800 nautical miles (1,482 kilometers) of icy ocean to the island of South Georgia. There they trekked 32 miles along the island's mountainous interior, eventually securing vital assistance at a manned whaling outpost. Attempts to repeat Shackleton's rescue mission have been done before, but Jarvis' journey has a special twist. In the name of authenticity, they will reenact the whole thing on a replica of the original lifeboat and use only equipment and rations available in the early 20th century. ""Nobody has managed to do it the way Shackleton did it -- with the same gear and the same boat,"" said Jarvis, who believes it's the most challenging expedition of his life. ""It's not to be taken lightly,"" he added. The only modern adjustments on board are the emergency gear and radios. Apart from that, the crew are facing exactly the same privations as their predecessors -- right down to the handmade reindeer skin sleeping bags, unpalatable but nutritious Pemmican (a concentrated mixture of fat and protein) and Shackleton's favorite whiskey ""Whyte & Mackay"". Jarvis and his crew have just left Elephant Island and are now sailing the rough Southern Ocean in their replica of the James Caird, a wooden lifeboat only 6.85 meters (22 feet) long; the size of a typical six-seated mini bus. They will then attempt the climb using only one small section of rope and a carpenter's adze -- just as Shackleton did. As the centenary of Shackleton's journey approaches, the motivation for this expedition is in large part to honor the great explorer's legacy, even if it means risking life and limb and overcoming some enormous challenges. ""There is a certain amount of luck involved, as well as the skill of the crew and the preparation of the boat,"" explained Jarvis, in an interview before he left for the Antarctic. The team's skipper Nick Bubb is concerned about the technical difficulties of operating an antiquated yacht. ""The boat doesn't have a keel, which means it will capsize easily. And since we are relying on celestial navigation, a cloudy sky will make it more difficult knowing where we are,"" he said. For the worst case scenario, there is a modern boat trailing them, ready to pick them up if disaster strikes. And, unlike Shackleton and his men, this crew hasn't already spent over 500 days abandoned in the Antarctic. Polar historian and author Dr Huw Lewis-Jones thinks this reenactment is an excellent way of resussitating interested in the early 20th century period known as the ""Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration"". ""We need people like Tim Jarvis to do things like this that bring history alive,"" Lewis-Jones said. ""Anyone who has ever been to the Southern Ocean knows how awesome Shackleton's journey was. It's quite rightly called an epic,"" he added. ""The human will to survive is strong and in Shackleton it found its perfect exponent. The man was a legend,"" Lewis-Jones said. As an environmental scientist, Jarvis also wants to draw attention to the climate change affecting Antarctica since Shackleton's time, which he attributes to global warming. Most of all, however, he wishes to honor the spirit of Shackleton's philosophy. ""One of his key messages was the importance of team work,"" Jarvis said. ""We need to all act together in this world today, to overcome our problems.""","Adventurers set to re-enact polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's epic journey.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's military-backed government signaled Wednesday that it plans to disperse supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy camped out at sit-ins in Cairo, raising fears it will trigger violent confrontations. Citing a threat to national security and traffic congestion, interim Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim was authorized to take ""all necessary measures to face these dangers and end them,"" Information Minister Durriya Sharaf el-Din said in a televised speech following the weekly Cabinet meeting. ""The acts of terrorism and the blocking of roads are no longer acceptable and represent a threat to national security and terrorize citizens,"" Sharaf el-Din said. The statement is being widely interpreted by local media outlets as a green light for security forces to disperse the thousands of protesters at the sit-ins at squares in Rabaa al-Adawiya and Nahda Masr. The announcement comes just days after more than 150 people died in clashes in Cairo and Alexandria, killings that were widely condemned by world leaders and the United Nations. Protesters accused police of opening fire and killing 72 people during a pro-Morsy demonstration in Nasr City, an area of Cairo where the Muslim Brotherhood has made its base. Amnesty International called the announcement ""a recipe for further bloodshed."" ""Given the Egyptian security forces' record of policing demonstrations with the routine use of excessive and unwarranted lethal force, this latest announcement gives a seal of approval to further abuse,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. The Interior Ministry is studying the appropriate measures for dealing with the protesters and any weapons and ""external elements"" in the two squares, state-run EGYNews said, citing a high-level security source. The source said forces would approach the mission according to the law and in phases, beginning with a warning, then use tear gas until the need for legitimate self-defense. Since Morsy was ousted from office on July 3, hundreds of people have been killed and thousands more wounded. The former Muslim Brotherhood leader became Egypt's first democratically president in June 2012 but quickly found himself at odds with the opposition before the military removed him from power and detained him this month. He has not been seen publicly since he was overthrown. Morsy is being held in relation for a jailbreak that took place during Egypt's 2011 revolution but well before he came to power, state media reported. One protester downplayed the Cabinet statement. ""It would be ridiculous to assume that the military is waiting for permission from government,"" Reda Abdelaziz, a member of the pro-Morsy Anti-Coup Alliance, told CNN. A doctor at the Muslim Brotherhood field hospital in Rabaa al-Adawiya said his entire family is at the sit-in and they're prepared for the worst. ""We will never leave. All the families are coming here, and we will stay,"" said Hesham Ibrahim. Several Egyptian human rights groups demanded in a statement released Tuesday the the interior minister resign over Saturday's killings and demanded that government forces refrain from further violence. Muslim Brotherhood officials said on the group's website that they will continue protesting until Morsy is put back in office. Also, prosecutors have extended the detention of top Muslim Brotherhood leaders for 15 days over charges of inciting to kill protesters in front of the Muslim Brotherhood office in the days before the July 3 military coup, state-run Nile TV said. They include Khairat el-Shater and Mohammed Rashad Bayoumi. AU delegation visit . A high-level African Union delegation working to ease tensions in Egypt met with Morsy and the leaders who replaced his Muslim Brotherhood-backed administration after coup, the AU said Wednesday. This comes amid international efforts to forge stability in a country seething with political tension and reeling from spurts of sporadic and deadly violence after Morsy was toppled on the heels of mass protests against his rule. Opinion: Morsy holds key to Egypt's future . The three-person AU group is sitting down in Cairo with a range of people in the same week that Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, met with current leaders, Muslim Brotherhood members and Morsy -- now held at an undisclosed location on a variety of criminal charges. ""The establishment of the Panel and its current visit to Cairo are part of the AU's efforts to assist Egypt in addressing the challenges confronting the country and ensuring that the legitimate aspirations of its people are fulfilled,"" the AU said in a statement. Opinion: How to rescue the Arab Spring . ""In so doing, the AU is acting on the basis of its relevant instruments and in the spirit of African solidarity, as Egypt's challenges are also Africa's challenges. A stable, democratic and prosperous Egypt constitutes a tremendous asset for the AU, as it strives to achieve its stated objectives."" The delegation consists of three former leaders: former Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare, former Botswana President Festus Mogae and former Djibourti Prime Minister Dileita Mohammed Dileita. Along with Morsy, the panel met with acting President Adly Mansour, interim Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei and Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the man who led the coup. Interactive: Africa's rocky road to democracy . It also sat down with Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby and representatives of several political movements. It plans to meet with the pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church, a women's group and diplomats. U.S. Senate acts . The Senate on Wednesday defeated a proposal to cut off U.S. aid to Egypt. The measure was pushed by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, after the military takeover in Egypt. Before the vote, Paul noted that the law is clear: Aid must end to a government where there is a military coup. But the measure, which would have shut off $1.5 billion in aid to Cairo, got the backing of only 13 senators. CNN's Schams Elwazer reported from Cairo. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Bibi Aisha, a young Afghan wife whose ears and nose were cut off by her husband, is heading to the United States on Wednesday for reconstructive surgery. Aisha made headlines and was on a recent cover of Time magazine, showing the plight of women in Afghanistan. ""When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out,"" Aisha said, describing the attack. ""It felt like there was cold water in my nose. I opened my eyes, and I couldn't even see because of all the blood."" But she survived. With the help of an American provincial reconstruction team in Oruzgan province and the organization Women for Afghan Women, she finally received the help and protection she needed. And now she is on her way to the United States, where the Grossman Burn Foundation will provide her with reconstructive surgery and a new life. Read a behind-the-scenes with Aisha then and now . Aisha says her mutilation was an act of Taliban justice for the crime of shaming her husband's family. At 16, she was handed over to her husband's father and 10 brothers, who she claims were all members of the Taliban in Oruzgan. ""I spent two years with them and became a prisoner,"" she said. Read more about Aisha's story . She eventually ran away but was caught by police in Kandahar. And although running away is not a crime, in places throughout Afghanistan, it is treated as one if you are a woman. Eventually her father-in-law found her and took her back to her abusive home. She was taken to a Taliban court for dishonoring her husband's family and bringing them shame. The court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off, an act carried out by her husband in the mountains of Oruzgan, where they left her to die. After Aisha's story was exposed to the world through various news organizations, offers of help poured in. But there are many more women still suffering. The United Nations estimates that nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan's women face some sort of domestic abuse. This in a country where there are fewer than a dozen women's shelters providing sanctuary from the cruelty they face. And all of them are privately run. ""Bibi Aisha is only one example of thousands of girls and women in Afghanistan and throughout the world who are treated this way. Who suffer abuses like this -- like this and worse,"" Women for Afghan Women board member Esther Hyneman said. In 2001, the situation of Afghan women and Taliban brutality received lots of attention. Now, organizations like Women for Afghan Women say, the international community is strangely silent on the issue. And with the Afghan government's plans to negotiate with some of the Taliban -- supported by many in the international community -- many fear that it will be the women who will pay the price. Hyneman says that not enough is being done to help the women in Afghanistan, and that feeds into the hands of the Taliban. Aisha is reminded of that every time she looks in the mirror. But at least now she will be going to the United States for a chance at a new life. And just like the iconic picture of an Afghan girl on a 1985 National Geographic cover brought the plight of Afghan women under Soviet oppression to the world's attention, many hope Aisha's face can show the new plight under the Taliban.","The Afghan woman whose ears and nose were cut off is heading to the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Controversial remarks by the last white president of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk, in which he validated the origins of ""separate but equal"" nation states, have been used by critics ""unfairly out of context,"" his foundation said. ""The FW de Klerk Foundation regrets that the comments that FW de Klerk made in his recent interview with Christiane Amanpour of CNN have been taken so unfairly out of context,"" the foundation said in a statement Friday. ""The question that she asked related to the policies that he had supported when he was a young man -- and his reply centered on his view that, though idealistic at the time, they had resulted in the unacceptable injustices of apartheid,"" said the foundation, whose founder and chairman is de Klerk. In the CNN interview, de Klerk would not back off his belief in the validity of the original concept of ""separate but equal"" nation states. That remark provoked criticism, including on Twitter where some South Africans said de Klerk isn't worthy of the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize he shared with Nelson Mandela for ending South Africa's apartheid regime. Said de Klerk on CNN this week: ""I don't apologize for saying that what drove me as a young man, before I decided we need to embrace a new vision, was a quest to bring justice for black South Africans in a way which would not -- that's what I believed then -- destroy the justice to which my people were entitled. My people, whose self-determination (was) taken away by colonial power in the Anglo-Boer War."" That, de Klerk said, is how he was raised. ""And it was in an era when also in America and elsewhere, and across the continent of Africa, there was still not this realization that we are trampling upon the human rights of people. So I'm a convert."" The foundation's subsequent statement elaborated on de Klerk's position, saying ""there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the idea that the problems of territories that include different peoples should be addressed on the basis of territorial partition. ""This, after all, is what has happened in such societies all over the world -- in the territorial divisions of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and more recently in Sudan. It is the solution that has long been advocated for Israel/Palestine,"" the foundation said. South Africa's apartheid system was born out of ""by the loss of the right of Afrikaners to self-determination in the Anglo-Boer War,"" the statement said. ""However, as De Klerk pointed out, the National Party's application of territorial partition was a complete failure because the territorial division was manifestly unfair (something that De Klerk opposed as a young politician),"" the statement said. ""The Amanpour interview dealt with De Klerk's views as a young man. He tried, as frankly as he could, to explain what motivated him at the time. What motivated him as a young man ceased many years ago to motivate him as a political leader,"" the statement said. ""Since the mid-eighties he has accepted that the policies that he supported as a young man were wrong and that there was not any possibility of justly settling South Africa's complex problems on the basis of territorial partition."" CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","F.W. de Klerk stirs controversy about the origins of ""separate but equal"" nation states .

"(CNN) -- Today we can tell the remarkable story of Shazia Ramzan, a 15-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl. Last October Shazia was travelling home from school with her friend Malala Yousafzai when a Taliban gunman boarded their bus and shot both of them. Malala suffered head and facial injuries and had to be rushed to hospital in the UK. Shot in the neck and arm, Shazia spent a month in hospital while her deep wounds healed. Both were attacked by terrorists who wanted to stop girls going to school. Shazia dreams of being a doctor. Fighting back from her injuries, she attempted to resume her schooling at home in the Swat Valley. So keen was she to return to school at the earliest opportunity that she ignored continuing threats to her life from the same Taliban terrorists who shot her and Malala. For months she has had to be escorted to school each day by two armed guards. Her home has had to be protected by police. Sadly, the more that Shazia spoke up, the more the threats escalated, making it difficult for her and her family to remain secure. And in the past few weeks violence has escalated across Pakistan. A female teacher was gunned down in front of her young son as she drove into her all girls' schools. A school principal was killed and his pupils severely injured when a bomb was thrown into a school playground in an all-girls school in Karachi just as a prize giving ceremony began. Only ten days ago, in a massacre which will long be remembered as the single worst terrorist assault on girls' education in recent years, the bus in which 40 female students were travelling from their all-girls college campus in Quetta was blown up by a suicide bomber. 14 girls were killed. So violent was the terrorist attack that another group followed the injured girls to hospital and opened fire on them again. Despite the public revulsion against the violence, the attacks have continued. Only this weekend two schools were blown up, while another two girls were murdered for posting a video in which they were filmed dancing in the rain. It is because of events like these that, with her family's support, Shazia feels forced to leave the country if she is to have the education she needs. Tomorrow she will resume her schooling in the UK after being flown over to Birmingham last weekend and reunited with her lifelong friend Malala. I first spoke to Shazia last November, a month after the attempted assassination. She told me then of her determination to persevere and to speak up for a girl's right to education. She called education the light that brightens up girls' lives. And when I met her off the plane from Islamabad on Saturday night, she told me that she wanted every girl to have the chance of an education. Her dream, she said, was to build schools so that every out-of-school girl could develop their talents and fulfil their potential. According to UNESCO, 700,000 school-age children in Malala and Shazia's home province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) are not at school today - and 600,000 are girls. They are some of the 32 million girls worldwide denied a place at school. In total, 500 million girls of school age will never complete their education. This makes the battle for education for every girl the civil rights struggle of our generation. And until we provide both the resources and security for girls to travel to school and feel safe from the Taliban, then many of Pakistan's schools will remain closed. The biggest force for change today is the courage of Malala and now Shazia and girls like them, who are no longer prepared to acquiesce in their subjugation. It is their courage that we will celebrate when at the United Nations on July 12th, the day of Malala's sixteenth birthday, we will hold Malala Day. A youth resolution will be passed demanding that world leaders provide the resources to get every child to school. Now with a new petition launched by Malala on A World at School, young people themselves from around the world are becoming more vociferous in fighting for their right to education than the adults who for centuries have been charged with delivering it. Go not just to Pakistan, where I met many of the million-strong Malala demonstrators demanding a girl's right to school. Travel to Bangladesh and you'll find girls who have created 'child marriage free zones', preventing themselves being kept from school in a loveless marriage they did not choose. Visit Nepal, where girls are fighting child slavery with the Common Forum for Kalmal Hari Freedom. Attend the marches in India led by child labourers, demanding not just an end to this form of slavery, but the delivery of their right to learn. PHOTOS: Malala's journey from near death to recovery . We saw how in the wake of the attack on Malala and Shazia, over three million people -- including a million out-of-school Pakistani children -- signed petitions calling for children to be able to go to school. This powerful movement is supported by international campaigns such as Plan's Because I am a Girl and Girls not Brides, started by Nelson Mandela's The Elders group. As we shift from the 20th century movement of women's emancipation to the 21st century campaign for women's empowerment, girls sense that the future is theirs. And it is this new liberation movement, led by girls, that we will celebrate in ten days' time when Malala addresses the United Nations. November 2012: Malala spurs school-for-all vow, now deliver .

"(CNN) -- Three monkeys dressed in suits crouch on bulging sacks of money, striking the symbolic pose of ""hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil."" At more than 10-meters tall, the imposing chimps are the size of a three-storey building, dwarfing onlookers gazing up at their grim, spray-painted faces. The menacing monkeys are joined on all sides by similarly fantastical and macabre creatures -- from skeleton divers to slobbering pigs -- and you get the feeling that out here, in the desolate British marshlands, no one would hear you scream were they to come alive. Welcome to the Duke of Lancaster. A hulking, rusting, abandoned ship on the Dee Estuary in north Wales, which has become a canvas for some of the most renowned graffiti artists from across Europe. Read related: Ghostly underwater art gallery breathes new life to sunken ship . ""It's got the potential to be the biggest open-air art project in the world,"" ship co-ordinator, Paul Williams, said. ""The quality and size of the pieces is spectacular -- there aren't many places in the world that can accommodate artworks 10-meters high."" Work of art . At a whopping 137-meters long, seven storeys tall, and weighing 4,500-tons, the former cruise liner is an awe-inspiring sight in the deserted countryside. It was this remarkable setting which prompted graffiti collective DuDug -- a word play on the Welsh for ""black duke"" -- to approach the ship's owners with the innovative idea of turning the abandoned vessel into a thriving arts destination. With the owners' approval, artists from across Europe began spray painting the decrepit ship, using cherry pickers -- a type of hydraulic aerial work platform -- to reach its towering walls. They are now campaigning to have the site reopened to the public as the centerpiece of an arts festival. ""When the pieces first started appearing, we had some people say 'that's no way to treat the ship.'"" Williams said. ""But there's no doubt that what they're doing is art -- the key definition between art and graffiti is graffiti is done illegally. This, however, is done with the owner's knowledge and accommodation. ""And if it's the catalyst for regeneration, it's got to be a good thing,"" added Williams. More from Mainsail: World's top five 'boatels' Vibrant vessel . The surreal artworks of punk geishas and bandit businessmen have an anarchist aesthetic inspired by the history of the ship -- particularly the owners' struggle with the local council to keep it open. The largest of these pieces is ""Eduk the Diver"" -- a skeleton in a retro deep-sea diving suit -- which is 18-meters tall and 14-meters wide. Hailing from across Europe, the top graffiti artists include France's GOIN, who created the impressive Council of Monkeys image, and Latvian KIWIE who painted the creepy pirates on the ship's bow. ""The first phase of artists chose the theme of corruption to work with and their artworks certainly portrayed this,"" Dudug co-ordinator, Maurice Blunt, said. ""I can see no better way to bring the historical plight of this beautiful old lady to the world other than creating a true landmark -- the largest open air gallery in Europe."" From ferry to funship . It's the latest reincarnation for a ship which began life as a British passenger ferry in 1956. Built in the same shipyard in Belfast as the Titanic, the Duke boasted an opulent interior, silver service restaurant and spacious cabins. ""She was one of the finest vessels afloat at the time,"" Williams said of the ship, which also operated as a luxury cruise liner during the summer months. In 1970 the Duke was converted into a car ferry and by 1978 she was destined for the scrap yard when four entrepreneurs bought her in the hope of turning her into a land-based leisure and retail complex. And so in 1979 the Funship, as she was known, was permanently beached on the banks of the Dee Esturay and equipped with a mall, cinema, game arcade, restaurant, nightclub and hotel rooms. Eerie inspiration . But the fun times would be short lived. The council withdrew support for the ship due to safety concerns, and it closed in 1985. ""After many years of long-running disputes with the council, the owners decided to lock the doors, walk away and concentrate on other business ventures,"" Williams said. ""John Rowley (one of the owners) always wanted to see the ship have a purposeful use and has continued to fight tirelessly to make that happen. ""Inside, it's like a time capsule. Other than some minor vandalism, it's immaculate."" The untouched interior adds a ghostly quality to the historic ship, which cuts an impressive figure on the deserted quay. ""It's a very eerie place,"" Williams said. ""But that's part of the reason why it captures people's imaginations.""","Grounded ship, Duke of Lancaster, attracts graffiti artists from across world .

"London, England (CNN) -- Nestled in a sheltered bay on the English Channel coast, Weymouth is one of Britain's most picturesque seaside towns. As the home to the Weymouth and Portland British National Sailing Academy it was the obvious choice to host all sailing events during the London 2012 Olympic Games. Located in the English county of Dorset, and smack bang in the middle of what is known as the ""Jurassic Coast"" -- a rocky and dramatic 153 kilometer coastline dating back 185 million years -- this area is arguably one of the most historically interesting regions in the UK. In 1348 it played a pivotal role in the spread of the Black Death, it was a major departure point for the settlement of the Americas and a critical location for Britain's defense during World War II. See also: Beheaded Vikings found at Olympic site . It also has a great cultural heritage and its spectacular vistas and dynamic seas have inspired many great British novelists such as Thomas Hardy and Ian McEwan, who even chose one of Dorset's beaches, Chesil Beach, as the title for one of his most celebrated novels. Throughout the summer, Weymouth and the surrounding towns and villages, are hosting countless events to celebrate the homecoming of the Olympic Games. To make your life easier CNN has selected some of the most interesting events and must-see tourist attractions right here. Weymouth & Portland Live . For anyone visiting Weymouth during the Olympics a trip to the Weymouth & Portland Live site is a must. Located in the center of Weymouth and overlooking its golden beach, the venue will show all sailing and other major Olympic events live on two giant 60 square meter television screens. During the Games 15,000 people are expected to visit the area each day. The free site opens its doors on Friday July 27 when it will be showing the Olympic opening ceremony, followed by a big firework display in Weymouth Bay. Interactive sports arena . If watching sports doesn't tire you out then a visit to the interactive sports arena might. Targeting the more active sports fans this venue lets visitors try out some of Britain's favorite sports including football, rugby, volleyball, cricket, bowling, sailing and kayaking. It is located right next to the Live Site and will be open July 27 - August 12. Maritime Mix . Branded as the ""London 2012 Cultural Olympiad by the Sea"" the Maritime Mix is one of the most ambitious cultural events ever put on in Dorset. It is an official part of the UK-wide London 2012 Festival which celebrates the best of British cultural life during the Olympic year. There are more than 80 free separate events featuring visual arts, music, choral performances, outdoor theater and circus, earth sciences, sound installations, video projection, dance and participative street celebrations. The Bayside Festival . For those who want to enjoy a bit of fun, light entertainment and plenty of cold beers during the Olympics, the Bayside Festival is likely to be the a popular pit stop. Located on the Weymouth peninsula the festival, which has a capacity of 9,000 people, will feature a wide range of music and entertainment along with lots of shops, food stalls and bars. For history buffs there's the Olympic Sailing Heritage Exhibition, military displays and a chance to board the classic cruise ship MV Balmoral for a tour of the Jurassic Coast. See also: Olympic sailors test waters for 2012 Games . Sea Life Tower . Rising 53 meter over Weymouth's Festival Pier this newly opened tower offers some stunning bird's eye views over the Olympic sailing arena. On a clear day the tower's slowly revolving observation deck reveals panoramic views of Weymouth Bay, the English Channel and the Jurassic Coast. b-side festival . For the third year in a row this contemporary art festival is being held in Weymouth, and this year it runs throughout the Olympics and Paralympics. The b-side festival features cutting edge British and international artists from Europe, the U.S. and China who are showcasing new commissions on the theme of ""margins, boundaries, portals and departure points"" using visual art, digital media, performance and film to display their work. According to organizers the aim of the festival is to ""delight and provoke in equal measures"" and with a program featuring ""misguided"" tours, telepathic drawing experiments, sound installations, film programs and interactive signage located in pubs, churches, alleyways, swimming pools and car parks it sounds like it will stay true to its word. Jurassic Coast . For those adventurous enough to go sightseeing around Dorset there is plenty to see even after the Olympics. The Jurassic Coast was England's first UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a must see attraction for anyone visiting Dorset. It covers 95 miles of dramatic coastline and features rocks dating back 185 million years -- spanning the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The coastline has plenty of fossils, dinosaur prints and geological marvels such as the 28 kilometer long barrier beach Chesil Beach and Lulworth Cove, which attracts half a million tourists a year. One of the best ways to see the Jurassic Coast is by sea so if you left your own boat at home you can easily hop on a boat trip from any of the gateway towns along the coast. For those who want to explore the coast by foot the 1000 kilometer (630 miles) long South West Coast Path National Trail offers plenty of coastal adventures. Inside Out Dorset festival . Held on the limestone island of Portland a few kilometers south of Weymouth, the Inside Out Dorset festival is free event that has been running since 2005. It aims to make art accessible and less ""intimidating"" and this year it runs from August 31- September 9. One of the year's highlights is the Harmonic Fields -- a sensory art installation featuring an ensemble of 500 instruments being played by the strong Dorset wind. Camp Bestival . Camp Bestival is the ""little sister"" of the very popular music festival Bestival, both organised by radio DJ Rob Da Bank. Held annually at the end of July at the majestic Lulworth Castle it is not the average raucous British festival but one for music-loving families with small children. It won the Best New Festival in the UK Festival Awards in 2008 and this year bands like Happy Mondays, Hot Chip, Kool & the Gang, Jimmy Cliff and Rolf Harris are performing.","Weymouth and Portland are hosting all sailing events during the London 2012 Olympics .

"(CNN) -- ""Cartoons are about doom and disaster -- and you don't get more doom and disaster than in a German prisoner of war camp,"" says Mike Peyton, the man uniquely hailed as the world's greatest yachting cartoonist. As a teenage illustrator from the British mining town of Durham, Peyton was captured by World War II German forces while drawing maps of the north African desert for the Intelligence Corps. Yet amid the horrors of his prison camp - the 91-year-old recalls eating Nazi guard dogs that had been clubbed to death - Peyton carved a unique space for laughter by drawing wry, darkly humorous cartoons. Published in a prisoner-run newspaper, the drawings poked fun at camp life, offering Peyton a distraction from the everyday brutality and his fellow inmates a rare source of joy. They would also spark the beginnings of a career spanning seven decades, more than 20 books and the birth of an unusual new genre in illustration - nautical cartooning. It's a genre that Peyton has dominated for 70 years, amassing followers across the world with his trademark, roughly scribbled drawings of rain-sodden sailors naively headed for impending doom. If the leap from a 1942 prison camp to hopeless yachtsmen lost at sea seems huge, Peyton has the answer: ""The secret to cartoons is you always need something going wrong."" Following the war, the then 24-year-old continued sketching his droll observations of everyday life. But it wasn't until Peyton bought a boat in his late 20s, setting up a business offering charter cruises, that he began to turn his illustrations to sailing. Now a retrospective of his work - ""The World of Peyton"" - published this week, features 150 of his favorite sketches. Read related: 'Queen of yachting' captures sailing's golden era on film . Sadly it will also be Peyton's last book, after gradually losing much of his eyesight. ""Mike has reached the point now where he is going blind,"" Janet Murphy, publishing director at Adlard Coles Nautical, said. ""It seemed such a cruel disability for a cartoonist to have their eyesight shot down. So we asked Mike to put together his best cartoons for a final retrospective."" Having been published in a plethora of British magazines ranging from Yachting Monthly to the Church of England Times, Peyton admitted it was a huge undertaking whittling down his immense collection of work. Science and technology periodical New Scientist paid tribute to the man who began drawing for them in the 1950s, claiming he had ""seen off more editors than anyone else at the magazine."" It added: ""His sharp eye and satire often contrasts with a softer, gentler approach when the subject warrants it."" But It is among sailing enthusiasts that Peyton's name brings most smiles. As Janet explained: ""Mike is synonymous with nautical cartoons."" ""He is on a pinnacle all on his own -- Mike is the one yachting cartoonist people think of. He's got a unique skill of seeing the funny side in a typical situation -- whether it's people huddling under waterproof gear or wives looking forlornly out the window as they lose their husbands to sailing in the snow on Christmas Day,"" she said. ""There's no one who can touch him, both because he's been going for 70 years and because he's been so prolific over that period."" Before Peyton, there simply were no yachting cartoonists, she argued: ""He blazed a trail. There was humorous writing around sailing but up until the war it was still quite an elitist pastime, which people took very seriously. ""It's quite hard to keep humor going year after year. But that's Mike's skill. Those everyday sailing mishaps such as tweaking bits of rope or relying on the weather strike a chord with people all over the world."" After the war Peyton pursued his love of drawing, heading to Manchester Art School where he met future wife and now successful children's author Kath Peyton. The penniless newlyweds spent their honeymoon sleeping rough across Europe, paying their way by collecting waste paper en route. ""I reckon I am the only bride that ever had to collect salvage in Paris to earn her fare back across the Channel,"" Kath recalls in Dick Durham's autobiography on Peyton, titled -- naturally enough - ""The World's Greatest Yachting Cartoonist."" Returning to the UK, the couple set up home in rural Essex on the River Crouch. But instead of spending their hard-earned savings on renovating their dilapidated cottage as planned, Peyton bought a boat -- much to his wife's dismay. His reason? ""You can't sail a house,"" he told CNN. When not drawing, the father-of-two worked as a sailor; taking out charter parties, racing boats and delivering yachts everywhere from London to the Baltic Sea. ""I didn't have to think up cartoons -- I saw them happen. They're all based on real life,"" he said. ""I remember years ago I thought I'd run out of ideas. But I never have.""","""The world's greatest yachting cartoonist,"" Mike Peyton, began career in German POW camp .

"(CNN) -- A line of sailors teeter on the edge of a giant yacht, peering down at the blazing orange island reflected on its lurching hull. The sailboat slices through the gray Mediterranean, passing the Italian island of Capri at just the right moment to catch a dazzling silhouette on its exposed underbelly. It's an incredible image, captured by Malta photographer Kurt Arrigo as he leaned out of a low-flying helicopter during the Rolex Volcano Race earlier this year. Arrigo has just been named winner of the prestigious World Yacht Racing Forum Image of the Year competition in Gothenburg, Sweden, chosen from an elite pool of internationally renowned sailing photographers. Arrigo said of the winning picture: ""The weather had been bad all day, but the sun suddenly came out for a short while."" ""We were leaving the area but I asked the pilot of the helicopter to fly back briefly over the leading boat -- that's when I took this photograph."" Veteran racing photographer Christian FÃ©vrier said the image would have been impossible 20 years ago, as film cameras would have struggled to capture a yacht racing so quickly with the same stunning level of clarity. ""The reflection at twilight in the hull was interesting. But the importance of the crew creates a second point of interest,"" he said of the lauded image. The fifth annual competition, sponsored by Mirabaud & Cie Private Bankers, is only open to professional photographers, this year attracting 46 of the best racing images from 2012. The spectacular photos captured some of the biggest events in the sailing calendar, from brutal waves bombarding competitors in the America's Cup to the festive atmosphere of the London Olympics. Competitors were judged on technical elements such as clarity, lighting, composition, and also originality. ""If you look at the images, hardly any could be taken by someone who's not heavily involved in the industry,"" Bernard Schopfer, one of the organizers of the event, said. ""Very often you have to be hanging out of a helicopter with no door or on board the racing boat in extremely violent conditions. It's also an investment to have the right equipment that can withstand the salt water."" The impressive images were whittled down to the top five by delegates from the World Yacht Racing Forum. The difficult task of choosing a winner was then decided by a panel of industry heavyweights. Judges included two-time sailing Olympic gold medalist and CNN Main Sail broadcaster Shirley Robertson. Ben Ainslie, who won his fourth sailing Olympic gold at London 2012, also sat on the panel, adding that the moving photographs had ""paid a great tribute to the variety and richness of the sport of sailing."" Arrigo, who has already published two photography books on his native Malta, was awarded a trophy at the event.","Malta photographer Kurt Arrigo wins World Yacht Racing Forum Image of the Year .

"(CNN) -- After less than a week at sea, the Vendee Globe single-handed round the world yacht race has lived up to its moniker as ""the world's toughest race"" -- with nearly a quarter of the field crashing out in the first few days. Earlier this week, 20 sailors set off from Las Sables d'Olonne in France to begin the 38,700 kilometer circumnavigation -- in which they are expected to battle everything from fierce storms in the Southern Ocean to the dreaded doldrums of the equator, with just themselves and an 18 meter yacht for company. In the six editions of the race, first held in 1989, only half of the competitors have ever completed it. So it is yet another testament, if one were needed, to the Vendee Globe's notorious difficulty that after five days, four competitors have already pulled out. French skipper Marc Guillemot retired on the first day after his boat Safran broke her keel, just 95 kilometers off the coast of France. Guillemont, 53, had been one of the favorites to win this year's Globe after finishing third in the last race, held in 2008-2009. Day two was similarly dramatic with compatriot Kito de Pavant, 51, also pulling out after his yacht Groupe Bel was struck by a fishing boat off the coast of Portugal. ""I went to sleep at the wrong time,"" De Pavant told organizers. ""I am not angry at the fisherman but at me because it should not have happened. You can't anticipate this,"" he said. Skippers are pushed to the limit, sleeping in snatches as they first sail the Atlantic, then the Southern Ocean, round Cape Horn and head back through the Atlantic to France -- all in the hope of winning $190,600 in prize money. When Sir Robin Knox-Johnston made history as the first person to sail non-stop around the world in 1969, the epic voyage took him more than 10 months. Fast forward 20 years and the Globe's competitors are expected to complete the course in just 90 days. French sailors have won all previous races, held every four years, with Michel Desjoyeaux taking the last one. But the third casualty was another Frenchman, Vende Globe first timer Louis Burton who, like his compatriot De Pavant, endured a dramatic collision with a shipping trawler on Wednesday. Finally, hoping to have made history as the only woman to ever win the race was Briton Samantha Davies, the only female sailor in this year's competition. But the mother-of-one, who finished fourth in 2009-2009, announced Thursday that the mast of her Open 60 Saveol yacht had come crashing down in rough seas north of Madeira in the Atlantic. Both Davies and Burton are prevented by race rules from stopping at the nearest port to make repairs with a return to Les Sables d'Olonnes the only option under the rules for a repair and continuation. In both cases, however, their boats are too badly damaged to make the six-day journey back to France. For the remaining 16 contestants -- currently led by 35 year-old Frenchmen Armel Le Cleac'h -- it's just the beginning of what is shaping up to be another drama-packed Vendee Globe.","Vendee Globe around the world yacht race sets sail from Les Sables d'Olonne, France .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's Health Ministry reported Tuesday finding radioactive materials at levels ""drastically exceeding legal limits"" in 11 types of vegetable grown in Fukushima Prefecture, including broccoli and cabbage, according to Kyodo News Agency. None of the vegetables has been shipped since Monday, it said. The news agency, citing the ministry, said, ""If a person eats 100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) of the vegetable with the largest detected amount of radioactive materials for about 10 days, it would be equal to ingesting half the amount of radiation a person typically receives from the natural environment in a year. ""If a person keeps eating the vegetable at the same pace, the amount of radiation intake could exceed the amount deemed safe."" Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Ibaraki Prefecture -- near the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant -- to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Wednesday. And the government of Fukushima Prefecture told residents not to eat leafy vegetables, he added. ""Even if you do eat these food items now, it's not going to cause any human health problems right away, and these levels are not high, so it would not cause any health problems over the longer term,"" he said. But, as the radiation levels continue to rise, ""we are looking at the possibility of levels reaching levels that may harm human health,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it has issued an import alert covering milk, milk products, fresh vegetables and fruit from any of four prefectures near the Japanese reactors -- Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma. Under the alert, those products will be prevented from entering the United States. Other food products from one of those prefectures will be diverted for testing, she said. But the Environmental Protection Agency said its air monitors -- three in California and one in Washington -- have detected levels of radiation that were ""millions of times below levels of concern."" Meanwhile, the process of getting Americans out of the stricken region continued Tuesday. Seven charter flights left Japan Tuesday carrying about 1,800 military dependents voluntarily evacuating from Atsugi Naval Air Facility, Yokoda Air Base and Mesawa Air Base. Some of the flights were bound for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and the rest to Travis Air Force Base in California. As the Navy continues to distribute potassium iodide to personnel, the service is instructing sailors who have come within 100 miles of the damaged reactor to take the pills, said Cmdr. Danny Hernandez. That recommendation clashes with one issued Monday by the State Department, which said it was making available supplies of the pills to U.S. government-related personnel in Japan, but that the distribution was being carried out only as a precaution. ""No one should take KI at this time,"" it said, referring to the salt by its chemical formula. The State Department did not immediately return a call seeking an explanation for the divergent recommendations. The salt protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine but can result in side effects, especially among people with allergies to iodine and shellfish and those who have kidney disease, certain skin disorders and thyroid problems, according to the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response. The National Police Agency reported Tuesday that the disaster has killed at least 9,301 people and left at least 13,786 missing, many of them killed when a wall of water swept over them after the quake. Another 2,722 were injured. Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been checked for radiation levels. TV Asahi aired what it said were the first interviews with workers, which were conducted Tuesday from Iwaki City in Fukushima Prefecture, where they have been billeted. ""It has settled down quite a lot compared to the beginning and we could even begin to see a bright hope that maybe it would somehow work out in a little bit,"" said one man. ""We are constantly switching over all the time, since the work cannot be stopped,"" said another. Neither man was identified by name. As for the plant's six reactors, Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency official Hidehiko Nishiyama said Wednesday that power had been connected to reactor No. 1 and fire trucks were being used to inject seawater into the core to cool it. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported Tuesday that coolant in the unit was covering only about half of the fuel rods in reactor Nos., 1, 2 and 3 and that Japanese officials believe their cores have been damaged. In the No. 2 reactor, power had not been restored, but the core was stable and workers were continuing to inject seawater into the spent-fuel storage pool, he said. The IAEA said that, after an explosion March 15, officials expressed concern that the containment vessel may no longer be intact. In the No. 3 reactor, electricity has been restored to the central control room and the Tokyo Fire Department was expected to start spraying water into the spent-fuel storage pool beginning at 4 p.m. Wednesday, Nishiyama said. The No. 3 reactor has been a priority for authorities trying to contain damage to the plant and stave off a possible meltdown. Its fuel includes plutonium mixed with the uranium in its fuel rods, which experts say could cause more harm than regular uranium fuels in the event of a meltdown. In the No. 4 reactor, power was connected to the control board; because the reactor has no fuel rods, the focus was on continuing spraying rods in the spent-fuel pool, he said. Power has also been connected to the No. 5 and No. 6 reactors, he said. Officials say some radiation has been released from the crippled plant since the quake and tsunami. And with the nuclear plant's six reactors in various states of disrepair, concerns have mounted over a potentially larger release of radioactive material from the facility, located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Restoration of power may not solve the cooling problems. TEPCO said Monday the quake and tsunami had damaged pumps and other gear at units No. 1 through No. 4. The company said spare parts were being brought in to make the repairs. The coolant pools contain used fuel rods that are radioactive and generate heat. Authorities have been working to keep the pools full to prevent the rods from being exposed and releasing radiation. About 660 workers were at the site Tuesday, TEPCO said. About 330 of those were employees of the power company. Several countries, including the United States, have urged citizens living within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the plant to evacuate or stay indoors.

"(Mashable)  -- Kimmel used Wednesday's episode of his Jimmy Kimmel Live show to declare November 17, 2010 National UnFriend Day [NUD] -- a new holiday he hopes will inspire Facebook users to unfriend the social networking contacts that aren't real friends. Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel believes Facebook is cheapening the meaning of friendship. ""NUD is the international day when all Facebook users shall protect the sacred nature of friendship by cutting out any 'friend fat' on their pages occupied by people who are not truly their friends,"" according to the show's website. Admittedly, Facebook friending does seem to be out of control. Facebook was once the social networking site we chose over MySpace to connect with our real friends; but over the years, many of us have accumulated dozens, if not hundreds, of Facebook friends that are, in fact, not actually our friends. Kimmel may have a point, but this rather funny joke of a holiday seems to be more a late night comedy sketch than an event manufactured out of real concern for the status of friendship. Still, National UnFriend Day is good natured -- at least for those not being unfriended -- and we might even take the day to cut some friend fat of our own. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Civilian casualties in Afghanistan increased 23% in the first six months of this year, the United Nations said in a report released Wednesday. The rise in the number of ordinary Afghans killed and injured reverses a decline in 2012. That was the first drop in civilian casualties since the U.N. began publishing the figures in 2007. The increase in deaths and injuries so far this year was mainly driven by the stepped up use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said in its report. Civilian deaths increased 14% from the first six months of 2012 to 1,319, the report said, while injuries rose 28% to 2,533. ""The violent impact of the conflict on Afghan civilians marked by the return of rising civilian casualties in 2013 demands even greater commitment and further efforts by parties to the conflict to better protect civilians who are increasingly being killed and injured in the cross-fire,"" said Jan Kubis, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Afghanistan. Nearly three-quarters of all civilian casualties in the first half of the year resulted from actions by anti-government groups, notably the Taliban, the U.N. report found. The remainder were caused by pro-government forces (9%), ground engagements between pro- and anti-government forces (12%) and unattributed factors like unexploded ordnance (5%). The report singled out the devastating effect of the use of IEDs, which caused 35% of deaths and injuries. The devices killed 443 civilians and injured 917. That's a 34% increase in overall casualties from the first half of 2012. ""The increase in the indiscriminate use of IEDs and the deliberate targeting of civilians by anti-government elements is particularly alarming and must stop,"" Kubis said. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan welcomed the report, saying it had taken ""a number of positive steps to reduce the number of civilian casualties in this country."" ""Unfortunately, the Taliban's demonstrated lack of regard for human life has resulted in nearly 90 percent of all civilian casualties so far this year. By continuing the indiscriminate use of improvised explosive device attacks despite the huge toll on Afghan men, women and children, the Taliban proves it does not take their pledge to protect innocent civilians seriously,"" ISAF said. But the Taliban criticized the report, saying it was ""in favor of Americans and part of the propaganda against the Taliban."" CNN's Brian Walker and Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","NEW: The Taliban criticize the U.N. report, saying it's ""in favor of Americans""

"(CNN) -- Tamara Rojo is so often described as the greatest dance actress of her generation, it might possibly be true. Prima ballerina with London's prestigious Royal Ballet for over a decade, the Spaniard's presence on a cast list is guaranteed to fill any theater in London, New York or Paris. Her graceful adagio combinations and perfectly formed arabesques may have wowed audiences across the globe, but how would the 37-year-old fare when parachuted into a dance culture she'd never encountered? This was the challenge for Rojo's ""Fusion Journey."" Over the course of 10 days, the classically trained ballerina traveled from London to Beijing to immerse herself in the traditions of Chinese dance and create a brand-new piece inspired by this meeting of east and west. Guided on her trip by a local rising star of Chinese contemporary dance, 34-year-old choreographer Fei Bo, Rojo said the experience will change how she thinks about performance forever. In her own words, this is the story of her journey. Tamara Rojo: Ballet affects everything I do. On a physical level it impacts what I eat and drink, how much I sleep, when I go out. But it also affects how I see the world. When I read a book, watch television, go to the theater, I think to myself: ""How can I assimilate that into my art form? How would that be translated on the stage into a ballet?"" This is one of the reasons why the thought of traveling to Beijing was so exciting for me. Classic ballet is based on very particular notions of beauty, much of which is derived from the Greek concept of harmony: Nothing too much or too little, all in perfect proportion, everything in a good relation to everything else. See also: See Beijing's hidden culture, before the bulldozers get there . But of course, other art forms and cultures have quite different notions of beauty. The first thing I noticed about the Chinese ballet is that it is much more influenced by philosophy than physicality -- there was a lot more emphasis on meaning. These ideas are typically expressed with little gestures of the hand or head. Such movements might not be the most beautiful to my eye, but because they have a shared cultural meaning -- a meaning that is understood by onlookers because it is part of their tradition -- it's beautiful to them. One of the main challenges I experienced out there was trying to understand this complicated and subtle language. While I could always admire Chinese and Asian dance from a distance, I felt that I could never really understand the depth of meaning -- and everything that comes with it -- until immersing myself in the culture first hand. I discovered that Chinese ballet is a relatively young art form. It was introduced by Madam Mao during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) and, until recently, it was used as a form of propaganda for the communist regime -- with communist heroines being saved by communist heroes and so on. But that part of history is viewed with mistrust by the younger generation, so at the moment ballet is going through a sort of reinvention. What's really surprising is that the youth of China are now obsessed with incorporating traditions from before the revolution. Unfortunately, a lot of that has been lost, and when they can't find what they're looking for, they invent it. So what they call classical Chinese dance is really only 10 or 20 years old and has bits of traditional ballet, a little bit of Kung Fu, a bit of contemporary dance, a bit of everything. After a mere two days immersed in Chinese culture, Fei Bo and I combined our influences from east and west to create something new: a fusion of dancing cultures. See also: Keeping the world's greatest dancers on their toes . The piece was choreographed by Fei Bo. He wanted to create something about a philosopher who had a dream and when he woke up he wasn't sure what reality was anymore. And then I remembered a very famous Spanish play by Pedro Calderon de la Barca called "" La Vida es Sueno"" which means ""Life is a Dream."" And it was funny that exactly the same saying exists in Chinese, in Spanish and in English, so we thought that it was the perfect fusion, the perfect combination of cultures for the title. While the choreography was made by Fei Bo, the interpretation was made by me. Imagine a performance of Hamlet by a Chinese theater company; the actors would interpret the text through their traditions and what they know acting is supposed to be, but those words are still, of course, intrinsically English. So, in a sense, it wouldn't be English and it wouldn't be Chinese. My performance of ""Life is a Dream"" is just the same. I was doing steps created by a Chinese contemporary choreographer and I am a classically trained European dancer, so my interpretation is where the fusion occurred. I'm not going to pretend that in one week I understand all the depth of Chinese culture or that I can really move my hands like a traditional Chinese dancer -- that would be naÃ¯ve and arrogant of me. However, I found that the need for human beings to understand the world through art and story telling is universal; we just have different vocabularies. I like to think that, in the future, my own performances will be enriched by new ways of communicating.","Royal Ballet principal ballerina Tamara Rojo travels to Beijing to create dance fusion .

"(CNN) -- Sudan's Deputy Chief Justice recently made the alarming announcement that his government might start training judges to cut off the hands and legs of convicted criminals, if doctors refuse to carry out amputations as punishment. Abdul Rahman Sharfi said non-cooperation over the use of such amputations would be punished. Adopting a defiant posture, he denied his government had ever stopped the use of one of the most severe forms of ""hudud"" punishments, which are based on an interpretation of Islamic law. Sharfi revealed that 16 people had been subjected to amputations since 2001, although the first reported case was that of Adam al-Muthna, 30, whose right hand and left foot were amputated by three doctors on 14 February. Al-Muthna had been found guilty of highway robbery. The amputation prompted a public outcry, particularly by the Sudanese Doctors' Union, which complained that doctors were horrified to have to break the Hippocratic Oath -- to protect patients, and not harm them -- in order to comply with government orders. Amputations are just one form of cruel punishment carried out in Sudan. Since 2005 thousands have been sentenced on counts of adultery, which carries the punishment of flogging, and, in some cases, stoning. Layla Ibrahim Issa Jumul was 23 years old and the mother of a six-month-old infant when she was sentenced to death by stoning on counts of adultery by a Sudanese judge last July. He didn't mind that she didn't have a lawyer to defend herself, or that she didn't understand what ""stoning"" meant. The second woman to be sentenced to death by stoning in 2012, she spent two months shackled, alone with her baby, in Omdurman prison, near the capital Khartoum. Both women were eventually released on appeal, following intense campaigns by Sudanese and international human rights organizations on their behalf. Others, though, are less fortunate. Almost every day in Sudan, someone is given 20 to 100 lashes on a court order for minor offenses, and following a summary trial. Many such floggings are carried out in public. These punishments are cruel, inhuman, degrading and may amount to torture. They are a clear violation of international human rights law and Sudan's own international commitments, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They are highly controversial within Sudan, which explains in part why the authorities have been unable to enforce them systematically. But for those affected, the suffering is real -- and revolting. As Sudan reviews its constitution, it is imperative that the authorities respect their international commitments, and address the issue of corporal punishments and the death penalty as a matter of priority. Such cruel punishments can no longer be tolerated. And laws need to be enforced and respected to put an end to them once and for all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Netsanet Belay.","Sudan threatens to train judges to cut off hands, legs of convicted criminals .

"(CNN) -- While those about him have lost their heads, Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has been a model of consistency. Whether it is players falling foul of the law, refusing to play, or simply getting swept up by the revolving door at the club's Etihad Stadium, Kompany has seen a number of teammates and managers come and go during his five years in Manchester. But the Belgian has led the line for City both on and off the pitch. The 27-year-old is captain of both club and country and his leadership helped City clinch a first English championship in 44 years in 2012. His stellar performances and articulate interviews have made Kompany an idol among fans and a respected figure within the media. Kompany's level head is something he credits to his education and his parents, who kept him grounded even when it became clear he was destined for sporting stardom. ""I couldn't go anywhere without finishing my studies,"" Kompany told CNN reflecting on the years he spent combining football and his education. ""I always remember playing in big games, millions of people watching, and the next day coming back at two o'clock in the morning. ""At eight o'clock I was just sitting on the bench with all my classmates and I was just a normal guy, but it's always given me the right balance. ""I thank my mother every day and my father every day for pushing me in that direction. They've never ever said to me, 'You're a great footballer. You've made it now just focus on your football.' ""They've always said keep other things at hand and I guess I still have this in my life now."" Blog: Is Gareth Bale worth $120m? Kompany's present is a far cry from his parents' past. His parents fled Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo, during the regime of president Mobuto Sese Seko, heading to Belgium where Kompany was born and raised. ""They've given us so much love when we were younger, but I guess like any modern family as well, we've had our problems in the fight,"" said Kompany of his parents. ""We've had financial difficulties like any normal family would have, but I think that the biggest lesson for me is that we've always come back to that education, the strength to do our own thing ... knowing that we would be okay even if we didn't have any money because we knew exactly how to handle situations."" Despite the success he has enjoyed since signing for City in 2008, Kompany continues to have numerous extracurricular interests. British newspaper the Daily Mail reported in January 2012 that Kompany had signed up for a three-year Business Administration course, while he also purchased a football club in his hometown and renamed it BX Brussels. The team, which plays at the bottom level of the Belgian football pyramid, is Kompany's attempt to ensure up and coming players are given the best possible start to their careers. ""I played football for Anderlecht from the age of 6 to the age of 20 so that has had a big impact on my life, at the same time as my parents and the schools I went to,"" he explained. ""I really believe that the interactions between all of those different assets led me to be better. ""I want to make a very strong link into the schools, maybe sometimes even the life at home for the kids. ""I think a part of the reason why a lot of young kids fail is because they don't have the support from home that they need to."" One obstacle faced by some modern footballers is racism. The key to tackling discrimination, according to Kompany, is also education. While Kompany pays little heed to the abusers, he still says it is important for the game's governing bodies to clamp down on the vocal minority. ""It's a very sad life, it's a very sad way of behaving so I wouldn't give them too much attention,"" he added. ""But at the same time, as much as I wouldn't teach my kids to give them too much attention, I hope the governing bodies will be extremely hard and extremely exemplary in the way that they deal with those situations.""","Vincent Kompany joined Manchester City from Hamburg in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- It's been a year of mishaps, but Boeing finally has some good news. The Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer announced over the weekend it had completed its first 787-9 Dreamliner. A larger incarnation of the 787-8, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is 206 feet long -- 20 feet longer than its predecessor -- and holds 40 more passengers. Its range is also greater, at 8,000-8,500 nautical miles, versus the 787-8s 7,650-8,200 nautical miles. Like the 787-8, the new plane uses 20% less fuel than other planes its size. Pre-debut . The new plane rolled out of the factory in Everett, Washington, and is in the flight line awaiting its first flight by Boeing teams. The plane will be delivered to Air New Zealand, its first customer, in mid-2014. More: What's so special about the 787 Dreamliner? This year, Boeing has had a total of 82 orders to date for the 787, with the largest order of 42 planes coming from American Airlines. Singapore Airlines has the second largest order for 787s with 30 planes ordered. Approximately 40 percent of all 787 orders to date (not just this year) are for the 787-9. Boeing's second and third 787-9 planes remain in final assembly. The company says the schedule is ""on track."" A troublesome year . The announcement is one of the few celebratory moments for the company in recent months. The four-month global grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet after an ANA flight was diverted following a battery fire in January was the first such global grounding in 30 years. The grounding was lifted at the end of April. Since the dramatic ANA incident, Dreamliner's list of problems have gone on to include a United Airlines emergency landing in Houston due to brake problems, a fire on an Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner at Heathrow Airport and plane groundings and investigations into a faulty fuel pump indicator, an electric panel, a plane oven and emergency beacons. As well as being lighter and more fuel efficient than other similar aircraft, the Dreamliner's in-cabin experience is different too. It has bigger, dimmable windows (out go the pull-down shutters), it has LED mood lighting and is pressurized at 6,000 feet rather than 8,000 feet, making air sickness less likely. ""We are working with our supplier partners to continue to introduce improvements to the 787-8 to enhance reliability, just as we do for all of our airplane models,"" said Boeing's communications representative Julie O'Donnell. ""As the 787-8 and 787-9 share a high degree of commonality, we will apply relevant improvements to the 787-9 as appropriate.""

"(CNN) -- A dislocated shoulder suffered in the warm-up wasn't enough to stop Marc Marquez from competing at the British MotoGP but the surging rookie saw his winning streak snapped by Jorge Lorenzo in a thrilling finish. Marquez overtook Lorenzo during the final lap at Silverstone only for the reigning world champion to slip inside his fellow Spaniard after he uncharacteristically went wide on a turn. Marquez, who began on pole, thus failed in his bid to claim a fifth consecutive victory. ""As usual Marc pushed in the last laps and overtook me but I didn't want to lose this race,"" Lorenzo told the BBC. ""When he overtook me three corners from the end, I thought it was over. ""But he opened a little space and I said, 'Now or never.' I'm very, very pleased."" The race was similar to last week's Czech Grand Prix, when Honda's Marquez stayed behind Yamaha's Lorenzo before making a late charge. On Sunday Lorenzo moved ahead of Marquez yards after the start -- they appeared to make contact side by side -- and held the advantage until he was passed with three laps remaining. Lorenzo quickly regained the lead but it looked as if Marquez would once again come out on top as the racers neared the finish line. Lorenzo ultimately had the last word. ""Anyway the battle was so nice with Jorge,"" Marquez told the BBC. ""Just the last corner I went a little bit too wide because I went too fast."" Despite the second-place result Marquez increased his lead in the individual standings to 30 points over teammate Dani Pedrosa, who settled for third. Lorenzo's deficit with six races to go was reduced from 44 points to 39. Marquez's spot on the grid was in doubt when he crashed in cooler conditions ahead of the race but he was soon patched up and ready. He said, though, that the injury made things difficult when he changed direction. Lorenzo and Pedrosa have had to contend with their own shoulder injuries this season, helping Marquez. There was drama, too, in the battle for fourth, with crowd favorite Valentino Rossi passing Alvaro Bautista in the late stages. Another crowd favorite at Silverstone, home hope Cal Crutchlow, came away disappointed after coming seventh. He started third on the grid.","Jorge Lorenzo ends the winning streak of Marc Marquez by capturing the British MotoGP .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Congress is tasked with debating U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, a common refrain from lawmakers is to follow the advice of military commanders. It has been repeated dozens of times, for instance, by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, when discussing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""We urge the administration to work urgently with Iraqi authorities to reach an agreement that reflects the best military advice of U.S. commanders on the ground,"" he wrote in a news release in 2011 about reducing the U.S. military footprint in Iraq. He said something similar in a 2012 statement about Afghanistan. Now that Congress will have its say on U.S. intervention in Syria, it has testimony and documents from top members of the military to reference, and some of the testimony falls short of an enthusiastic endorsement of U.S. involvement. Concerns exist within the ranks of the military over the outcome of such strikes, and those concerns are coupled with worries about strains on an already stretched military. Dempsey: Intervention in Syria could cost billions . A frank assessment of the risks . In a series of communications with Congress over the summer, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified and wrote letters to Congress about the risk of U.S. military involvement in Syria. Chief among them is the challenge that a limited strike remain limited in scope. In an assessment to Sen. Carl Levin, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on July 19, Dempsey outlined possible scenarios and the risks they bring. Dempsey said U.S. involvement, even if it's limited in nature, would probably lead to an extended stay. ""Once we take action, we should be prepared for what comes next. Deeper involvement is hard to avoid,"" he wrote. Dempsey explains that risks include retaliatory attacks by the al-Assad regime, civilian casualties and ""extremists"" -- including al Qaeda, Hezbollah and Iran -- gaining more control and access to weapons, including chemical weapons. Two days before the alleged chemical attacks in Syria, Dempsey replied to a request from New York Rep. Eliot Engel on Dempsey's assessment of different military options in Syria. The general outlined a difficult path for U.S. success in Syria. ""In a variety of ways, the use of U.S. military force can change the military balance, but it cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict,"" Dempsey wrote. ""It is my belief that the side we chose must be ready to support their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not."" Another high-ranking member of the military urged extreme caution. According to the Washington Post, Gen. James Mattis, former head of U.S. Central Command, said at a security conference in July that ""this is going to be a full-throated, very, very serious war"" if the U.S. becomes involved. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon said he has concerns about the ongoing strategy after an attack. ""I'm concerned about more the military aspects, what are we expecting Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, their other allies in the region to do. What are we doing about any attacks that might happen to Israel or Jordan or Turkey, other areas in the region,"" said McKeon, R-California. ""For that matter, our embassies around the world. Are we doing everything we can to make sure we're able to protect ourselves should they do any kind of counterattack?"" Overstretched military . Any U.S. involvement will not be cheap. The U.S. is coming off a decade-long war in Iraq and is still fighting a 12-year-long war in Afghanistan. Additionally, tight budgets caused by forced spending cuts are concerning to those both inside and outside the military. The most likely scenario in Syria would be cruise missile strikes followed by a bomb damage assessment, with additional strikes on what was missed or not destroyed. Additionally, if the U.S. goes after chemical weapons capabilities, airstrikes would necessitate taking out Syria's air defense and command and control capabilities. Dempsey wrote in his July letter that using ""lethal force to prevent the use or proliferation of chemical weapons"" could cost ""well over $1 billion per month."" He also wrote that controlling chemical weapons would require more resources than just air and cruise missile strikes. He said it would need to be coupled with ""thousands of special operations forces and other ground forces"" to secure critical sites. President Obama, however, has said he would put ""no boots"" on the ground in Syria. The $1 billion price tag could take a hefty bite out of a slimmed-down military budget. Members of the military have testified before Congress and released statements about the crippling effect that the forced spending cuts has had on the military. Military operations will be ""significantly and adversely affected,"" an August 10 Defense Department news release said. The military requested and the president proposed a budget of $526.6 billion for 2014, which is 8% more than what the Defense Department is currently operating with. Defense Department Comptroller Robert F. Hale told Congress that that request ""supports national security interests in a time of very complex challenges."" But it's unclear whether the military would get its wish. Congress has not overturned the forced spending cuts, which would slash $52 billion next year. As the military points out, the sequester's impact in 2014 would be 40% greater than 2013. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, said the U.S. simply can't afford to get involved in Syria. ""We're in a position right now where we don't have the assets to get involved in another intervention,"" he said on CNN's ""The Lead"" last week. McKeon had similar concerns about the forced spending cuts. ""That is the thing that really concerns me is, sequestration on the backs of our military is making it very difficult for them to carry out mission after mission,"" McKeon said. Congressional hawks tie Syria to budget cuts . In addition to budget cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have strained the military but also taught military leaders valuable lessons. Dempsey wrote: ""We have learned from the past 10 years; however, that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state. ... Should the regime's institutions collapse in the absence of a viable opposition, we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control."" Rep. John Garamendi, D-California, echoed Dempsey's sentiment. ""The past decade has amply demonstrated the folly of military commitments poorly conceived,"" he wrote in a statement. Secretary of State John Kerry dismissed that argument. ""Fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility,"" he said Friday. Despite concerns, support exists . However, some former top military leaders are coming out in support of a military strike. Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme commander of NATO who led military forces in the Kosovo war in 1999, laid out a grim assessment. ""At a time when the U.S. faces many other security threats, not to mention economic and political challenges at home, it is tempting to view action against Syria's regime as a significant distraction. Certainly, it also carries risks. ... You can't always control the script after you decide to launch a limited, measured attack,"" he wrote in an opinion piece Friday in USA Today. Despite his measured tone, he said the humanitarian crisis is the U.S.'s responsibility. ""President Obama has rightly drawn a line at the use of chemical weapons. Some weapons are simply too inhuman to be used. And, as many of us learned during 1990s, in the words of President Clinton, 'Where we can make a difference, we must act.' "" Dempsey has not made any public statements about U.S. intervention. He's scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.","Budget cuts, cost of fighting two wars have stretched the military thin .
Dempsey wrote that U.S. forces can change the military balance, not what's fueling the conflict .
Trying to prevent further use of chemical weapons could cost $1 billion per month, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Nothing drives home the luxury lifestyles of the rich and famous quite like images of them lounging on a sun-drenched superyacht. But even wealthy yacht owners -- who often use their magnificent boats for just a few weeks a year --are not averse to making some extra cash by renting them out. And if you're willing to splash out, you could be cruising the waves in the very same vessels used by A-list pop stars, royalty, and world leaders. From Beyonce to Grace Kelly, CNN takes a look at the most beautiful celebrity yachts available for hire. Beyonce on board . When Beyonce performed at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009, the soulful songstress was left high and dry without a luxury vessel -- until she chartered 30-meter superyacht Asfar. At $109,000 per week, the sleek boat features three elegant suites, with room for 11 guests. Four crew members -- including a chef, a captain and deck hands -- were also on board to cater to their elite guest's every whim. ""Beyonce had a great time, sailing around the beautiful west coast of Abu Dhabi,"" said the CEO of an Abu Dhabi charter company which hired out the plush yacht. ""She just wished she could have stayed longer."" Old school Grace . From modern day divas to past princesses, you could be sunning yourself aboard Grace Kelly's iconic honeymoon yacht M/Y Grace -- as it tours the Galapagos Islands. The charming wooden yacht was given to Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco as a wedding present from shipping mogul Aristotle Onassis in the 1950s, with the royal couple spending their honeymoon sailing it along the stunning Italian coast. Today the iconic boat has been refitted with nine luxury staterooms and a top deck hot tub. Guests can enjoy fine dining as they meander past Ecuador's remarkable islands teeming with unusual wildlife such as giant tortoises and marine iguanas. A week in the master suite will set you back $6,600. P. Diddy's iPad superyacht . When rapper tycoon P. Diddy goes on holiday, he doesn't do things by halves. The Grammy Award-winning musician relaxes on one of the most luxurious and high-tech superyachts in the world -- Solemates -- which even boasts an iPad-controller. From the luxury of their top deck jacuzzi, guests can control practically everything but the captain's steering wheel -- all with a leisurely brush of their ipad. The 60-meter yacht also features an aromatherapy shower, James Bond-style underwater hovercraft, and a gym which converts into a disco. The price is similarly spectacular -- around $685,000 per week during the height of summer. All the presidents' yacht . When former American President John F. Kennedy wanted a few hours rest from the White House, he would supposedly slip away on the Potomac River for a leisurely cruise on his yacht, Honey Fitz. Built in 1931, the pretty wooden vessel has served five American presidents, including Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and of course JFK -- whose wife Jackie installed the boat's very first color TV in the 1960s. The recently renovated 70-passenger yacht is now completing a charity fundraising tour around the U.S., but is still available for private hire, costing around $5,000 for four hours. Richard Branson's Belle . If anyone knows spectacular modes of transport, it's Virgin business mogul Richard Branson. The British billionaire's 32-meter catamaran -- Necker Belle -- includes four luxury suites, each with its own ensuite and flat screen TV. Thrill seekers can also enjoy the sleek vessel's roof-top diving board, scuba diving equipment and three-person mini submarine, dubbed ""Necker Nymph."" Guests can cruise the Caribbean in the grand yacht for a cool $110,000 per week.","Looking for a holiday with celebrity glitz and glam?

"(CNN) -- It was a rare bright spot on an otherwise hazy, smoke-filled horizon. As firefighters worked to get a grip on one of the largest wildfires in California's history, an evacuation advisory was lifted Thursday for residents in Tuolumne City, a picturesque community threatened by the blaze. In a further sign of progress, authorities also withdrew similar advisories for two other northern California communities close to the flames, Soulsbyville and Willow Springs. Known as the Rim Fire, the conflagration has charred nearly 200,000 acres, cost the state more than $39 million to date and is threatening 5,500 structures, of which 4,500 are residences. It's the fifth-largest wildfire in California history. On Thursday, it was in its 12th day and it had only been contained 32%, according to Cal Fire. That's a slight improvement from the 30% containment the day before. Because of the approaching flames, officials have shut down electricity generators, and San Francisco -- more than 120 miles to the west -- is temporarily getting power from elsewhere. 5,000 firefighters battle the blaze . While the Yosemite Conservancy says the Rim Fire has consumed tens of thousands of acres inside Yosemite National Park, it has so far had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the park's iconic attractions, including the El Capitan rock formation. What you need to know about wildfires . Firefighters hope to keep it that way. Nearly 5,000 people have been assigned to tackling the blaze. ""This is going to be a tough fire,"" said Tom Tidwell, chief of the U.S. Forest Service. ""It's going to continue for a few more weeks."" The blaze has created challenges not only for utility providers, but also for local firefighters, who fill in for state and federal fire teams. ""It makes more work for us. Everybody has to work more, whether they are up there or not,"" Art Ray, chief operator for the Stockton Fire Department, told CNN affiliate KCRA. Some firefighters get little sleep, working four straight days, he said. ""We have to work 72 or 96 hours in a row, and being away from your family with little sleep and physically demanding takes a toll,"" Ray said. 'A lot of work to be done' Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation. Wildfire threatens 90-year-old cabin . ""There's a lot of concern, and there's a lot of work to be done,"" Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley said. Firefighters have been able to build fire lines in several locations, officials say. The forecast is looking favorable as daytime highs sink into the 60s in Yosemite National Park over the Labor Day weekend, a break from the temperatures in the 80s firefighters were facing earlier in the week. More than 20 helicopters and air tankers were aiding the efforts. Firefighters battle blaze near Yosemite .

"(CNN) -- The Hoh Rain Forest doesn't let visitors see far into the trees. Its annual rainfall exceeds 12 feet, providing the fuel to grow thick canopied foliage that once stretched continuously from Alaska to Central California. But the Olympic peninsula isn't just home to some of the last slivers of temperate rain forest in North America. Eastward through the impenetrable trees stands glacier-capped Mount Olympus and to the west is Washington state's rocky coast. Olympic National Park celebrated its 75th anniversary on June 29. From the 600-foot deep Lake Crescent to the Douglas firs at Staircase, the park's nearly one million acres is one of the last stretches of untouched wilderness in North America. Park stats: Olympic National Park was the seventh-most visited national park in 2012. It has averaged nearly 3 million visitors a year since 2008. The location: The park is on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, about two and half hours northwest of Seattle. The Washington State Ferry system offers a variety of ways to access the Olympic Peninsula. William R. Fairchild International Airport, the closest airport to the park, is in Port Angeles, the closest city. If you go: Park admission is $15 a vehicle. Individual passes are $5 (hiker, bicycle, motorcycle) and children 15 and younger are free. Passes are valid for seven days. Backcountry visitors must purchase a Wilderness Camping Permit. The cost is a $5 registration fee plus $2 for each camper. Reservations are required for camping in certain areas. Olympic National Park's nearly 1 million acres consist of mountains, rain forest and beaches. Each area has unique weather patterns that can be unpredictable. Be sure to check tide charts and trail conditions before planning adventures. Meet our ranger: Barb Maynes is the public information officer at Olympic National Park. Originally from New Jersey, Maynes, 57, says her infatuation with nature started earlier than she can remember because her family took yearly camping trips in national parks. When Maynes was 13, they spent six weeks exploring national parks in the Southwest. At the Grand Canyon, Maynes says she befriended a ranger. ""He had quite a bit of patience with me, answered all the questions I had,"" she says. ""By the end of the four days, I decided I wanted to be just like him when I grew up."" Maynes worked as an intern at Shenandoah National Park during college. After college, she applied to Grand Canyon ""on a lark"" and was hired as a winter employee. She spent eight years working as a seasonal ranger in six national parks before landing her first permanent job at George Washington Birthplace National Monument. Maynes came to Olympic National Park in 1988. ""Olympic has a little bit of everything, and it is extremely diverse,"" she says. ""Whatever your mood is, you can do that here -- be on a mountain top, walk through a sheltered forest or walk on a beach."" For a day trip, don't miss: Seeing the sunrise from Hurricane Ridge, driving along Lake Crescent, visiting the Hoh Rain Forest and heading toward the coast. ""(Hoh) is the place where you can experience a temperate rain forest, and it's a pretty rare sort of ecosystem,"" she says. ""In spring, there are days when it really does look like the air is green."" Favorite less-traveled spot: An approximately seven-mile hike on the Grand Ridge Trail between Obstruction Point Road and Deer Park Road. Maynes said both roads are gravel and are at high elevations. They do not require a four-wheel-drive vehicle, she says, but don't try driving an RV on them. ""They tend to have 10 to 12 feet of snow during the winter and don't typically open until part way through the summer, so it's really a treat to get out there,"" she says. Favorite spot to view wildlife: Coastal tide pools during low tide. The pools feature a variety of wildlife including star fish and anemones. ""It's kind of a whole new world and a whole new picture of wildlife,"" she says. Most magical moment in the park: Fourth of July on Rialto Beach. Maynes went with friends to the beach to watch fireworks set off from the Quileute Indian Reservation (It is illegal to have fireworks in national parks). As the fireworks began to wane, she noticed the waves started to glow with bioluminescence. ""Wherever we walked and put pressure on the sand, our footprints were glowing behind us,"" she says. ""We (also) had these phenomenal natural fireworks that were happening in the water."" Funniest moment in the park: Stumbling upon a black bear in the Elwha Valley that was eating elk intestines like spaghetti noodles. ""I was thinking about bears, and I was thinking about how it was the time of year that you have a fairly good chance to see one because they are emerging from their dens,"" she says. ""That was closer than I wanted to be to a bear."" Oddest moment at the park: Her daughter falling into a tree well while they were snowshoeing on Hurricane Ridge. Maynes says the winds that whip over Hurricane Ridge create massive snow drifts. But the snow does not accumulate at the base of trees, creating a well where you can sometimes see all the way to the ground around trees. ""I was trying to introduce her to being an outdoors gal, and we went up to have a closer look at the trees,"" Maynes says. ""She said 'Mom,' and I turned around and she wasn't there. Thankfully, she wasn't hurt. We do caution people to stay away from the tree wells."" A ranger's request: Pack in anticipation of varying weather patterns. ""It might seem intuitive,"" she says. ""But I think it's a little hard to overestimate how changeable the weather is and to be really be prepared for anything."" Another park she'd like to visit: Buck Island Reef National Monument in the Virgin Islands. The island is surrounded by a coral reef. ""It's an area of the country that I haven't been and so that is very interesting to me."" What national park would you like to visit?

"(CNN) -- A U.S. warship arrived before dawn Thursday near a 28-foot lifeboat holding four pirates and the kidnapped captain of a U.S.-flagged cargo ship, officials said. The USS Bainbridge, a guided-missile destroyer, is heading to the area to assist. Also nearby was the Maersk Alabama -- which had been seized early Wednesday off the Horn of Africa. All 20 of its remaining crew members were in good physical shape, said Ken Quinn, second officer of the ship, in a satellite call placed by CNN. ""There's four Somali pirates, and they've got our captain,"" Quinn said. Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers said the guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge was near the Maersk Alabama and that its crew was talking to the Navy. ""When the Navy comes in, they're in charge,"" Speers told CNN. The hijackers boarded the Maersk Alabama early Wednesday, when it was about 350 miles off the coast of Somalia, a haven for pirates attacking shipping through the Gulf of Aden. Capt. Richard Phillips was being held in the lifeboat after the pirates reneged on their agreement to exchange him for one of their own, who himself had been captured by the crew members, Quinn said. ""We returned him, but they didn't return the captain,"" said Quinn, who added that the crew members were in radio contact with Phillips.  Quinn describes the hijacking to CNN » . By 8 p.m., the Bainbridge, part of the allied fleet that patrols the waterway, had reached the Maersk Alabama to assist, a senior Defense Department official said. A Navy plane had reached the area an hour before. B.J. Talley, a spokesman for the Maersk line, said the ship was about 215 nautical miles off the Somali coast at 7 p.m. ET. The 780-foot (237-meter) Maersk Alabama is the first U.S. ship to be seized in the latest wave of piracy off largely lawless Somalia. Joe Murphy, whose son Shane is the ship's first officer, called the hijacking ""a wake-up call for America."" ""They're making more money in piracy than the gross national product of Somalia, so it's not going to go away any time soon until there's international concern and international law enforcement,"" said Murphy, an instructor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. The Gulf of Aden, at the southern mouth of the Red Sea, is a key transit point for ships moving into or out of the Suez Canal. In 2008, Somalia-based pirates attacked more than 100 ships in the gulf or off the Horn of Africa, capturing about 40 of them. The ships and their crews typically are held for ransom. Since 2006, the United States has had an agreement with Kenya to try captured pirates with American assistance. Tom Fuentes, a former FBI official who worked with Kenyan authorities to prosecute pirates, said a 1988 treaty gives every nation the authority to pursue, capture and try pirates, regardless of the nationality of the victims -- but the United States can't tell shipping companies how to deal with hijackings, he said. ""Every shipping company so far has paid the ransom, and every victim has been released unharmed up until this point,"" he said. After a lull early this year, attacks surged again in March, with 15 attacks reported to the Malaysia-based International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy. An international task force under U.S. command was set up in January to crack down on the problem, and the European Union, India, China and Russia have ships deployed to the area as well. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Wednesday for more international cooperation during an appearance with Moroccan Foreign Minister Taib Fassi-Fihri. ""I think Morocco was the very first country that recognized us, going back a long time,"" Clinton said. ""We worked to end piracy off the coast of Morocco all those years ago, and we are going to work together to end that kind of criminal activity anywhere on the high seas.""  Watch Clinton comment on attack » . The Maersk Alabama was carrying food aid bound for the Kenyan port of Mombasa when it was seized about 7:30 a.m. (12:30 a.m. ET), the ship's owner said. There were 21 American crew members on board at the time.  Watch officer's wife comment on the attack » . Quinn said the pirates were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, while the freighter's crew carried no weapons. The crew -- apparently minus the captain -- locked themselves in the compartment that contains the ship's steering gear, where they remained for about 12 hours with their captive, whom Quinn said they had tied up. The three other pirates ""got frustrated because they couldn't find us,"" he said. The pirates had scuttled the small boat they used once they climbed aboard the freighter, Quinn said, so Phillips offered them the Alabama's 28-foot lifeboat and some money. John Reinhart, CEO and president of Norfolk, Virginia-based Maersk Line Ltd., said the crew can try to outrun the pirate boats or turn fire hoses on anyone trying to board the ship, ""but we do not carry arms."" The vessel was carrying relief supplies for USAID, the U.N. World Food Program and the Christian charities WorldVision and Catholic Relief Services. The U.N. agency said its portion of the cargo included nearly 4,100 metric tons of corn-soya blend bound for Somalia and Uganda, and another 990 metric tons of vegetable oil for refugees in Kenya. ""There are starving people in Africa who need this food,"" Reinhart said. CNN's Tom Watkins, Charley Keyes, Mike Mount, Rachel Streitfeld and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. warship nears boat carrying pirates, U.S. captain held hostage .

"(CNN) -- Women wanted him. Men wanted to be him. Seven decades before Neymar, a world away from Ronaldinho and Ronaldo, a predecessor to Zico and Socrates and a formidable striker who could have rivaled Pele. That man was Heleno de Freitas, a soccer superstar in the days before Brazil ruled the ""beautiful game."" He was a larger than life playboy who abandoned a legal career to become his country's finest footballer. And before the Maracana -- Brazil's iconic stadium in Rio de Janeiro -- was built, Heleno was the city's star attraction with a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" personality which saw him flit from outrageous charmer to disruptive egoist. ""Sometimes he was a gentleman, other times you couldn't stand him,"" explains Marcos Eduardo Neves, author of ""There was never a man like Heleno."" ""Like the book by R.L. Stevenson, he was a doctor and a monster,"" Neves told CNN. Heleno is best remembered for his nine-year spell with Rio club Botafogo, scoring over 200 goals for the team between 1939 and 1948 to become one of South America's most feared strikers. Blog: Can anyone stop Spain at 2014 World Cup? But his career, much like his life, was tinged with tragedy, as circumstance and his ability to press the self-destruct button prevented him from capturing any significant silverware as a player. ""He grew up knowing he wanted to be a football player,"" says Neves. ""When he moved from Minas Gerais to Rio he marveled at beach football and Botafogo ... His will became an obsession."" An affluent background had afforded Heleno the opportunity to train as a lawyer, but the courtroom could not contain his football talent or his vibrant personality. World Sport Presents: Racism in Football . ""He had a big ego and his soul craved the screams of thousands of football supporters,"" Neves says. ""He loved his star status, being an international idol, playing for his national team and being desired by women and admired by men. ""He thought his fame would be eternal. He believed he would be Heleno de Freitas forever."" Arguably Heleno's crowning moment -- Brazil's crowning moment -- should have come at the 1950 World Cup. It was the first time Brazil had hosted the tournament -- next year the World Cup returns to the South American nation for a second time-- and it was an opportunity for the country to announce itself as a global power, both on and off the pitch. With the grandest of stages -- the Maracana -- constructed, Heleno's public awaited. But when 200,000 Brazilians packed into the stadium for an agonizing defeat to Uruguay in the tournament's final match, Heleno was nowhere to be seen. ""Because of World War II, Heleno missed out on the World Cups of 1942 and 1946,"" explained Neves. ""The 1950 World Cup was his last chance, given his physical and technical peak. But he wasted it."" In 1949 Heleno was playing for Vasco Da Gama, having spent the previous year living the high life in Argentina with Boca Juniors -- with his spell in Buenos Aires rumored to have even included a fling with Argentina's then First Lady, Eva ""Evita"" Peron. Heleno's coach at Vasco was Flavio Costa, who was also in charge of the Brazil national team. But Costa criticized the attitude of his combustible star and Heleno's response was typically trigger happy. He pointed a gun to Costa's head and pulled the trigger. The gun wasn't loaded, but that action was enough to kill Heleno's dreams of playing in the World Cup. Vasco won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship, but by now Heleno was an outcast. When Brazil was left heartbroken by a 2-1 defeat to Uruguay which destroyed its World Cup dreams, Heleno was playing in Colombia's lucrative illegal leagues. ""For the fans, Brazil lost the World Cup because they didn't have Heleno,"" says Neves. ""Brazil feared a valiant Uruguay. With Heleno, it wouldn't be like this. He didn't fear anyone or anything. ""They say that, in 1951, Heleno used to say he could have saved Brazil,"" says Jose Henrique Fonseca, director of the biographical film ""Heleno,"" which was released in 2011. By the time Brazil, led by the precocious talents of Pele and Garrincha, finally won the World Cup for the first time in Sweden in 1958, Heleno was hurtling towards an early grave. ""Heleno became a walking bomb ready to explode. Syphilis and drugs just amplified his self-destruction,"" Neves says. ""He had a good upbringing, he was elegant, educated and from a good family. He could have enjoyed a career as a lawyer or diplomat -- instead he suffered a pathetic death in a mental institution."" Heleno died on November 8, 1959, aged just 39. ""He was a victim of his refusal to be treated for syphilis and if untreated it affects the brain,"" Fonseca told CNN. ""He suffered a lot. To see a photo of him when he died is amazing, he looked 70 years old."" Could Heleno, free from disease and drug addiction, have carved out a legacy as formidable as Pele, who is widely regarded as the greatest player who has ever lived? ""Pele is one of a kind, like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and surfer Kelly Slater are,"" says Neves. ""But Heleno would be more recognized worldwide. Maybe at the level of a Zico, Romario and Ronaldo."" For Brazil, much like the tale of the 1950 World Cup final, Heleno's story is one of what might have been.","Heleno de Freitas was one of Brazil's first soccer stars .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's National Olympic Committee has finalized the list of its athletes who will represent the nation at the forthcoming Olympic Games to be held at the Chinese capital, Beijing, this year. Thilini Jayasinghe, shown here in 2006, will compete in badminton for Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan team of three men and four women includes athletic sensation Susanthika Jayasinghe; javelin thrower Nadeeka Lakmali; badminton player Thilini Jayasinghe; shooter E.M. Senanayake; and boxer Anuruddha Ratnayake. In addition, the NOC has included Mayumi Raheem and Daniel Lee for the swimming events. This time, too, Sri Lanka is pinning hopes on veteran athlete Susanthika Jayasinghe, who will be competing at the Olympics in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter events. Although she stands at No. 31 in the IAAF rankings list for the 100-meter sprint, it does not exhibit her true potential. Her best performance in the 100-meter this year was 11.24 seconds, recorded at the Doha-Qatar Super Grand Prix last month. Susanthika's pet event is the women's 200 meters, for which she won the bronze at the Sydney Olympics, eight years ago. According to the IAAF rankings, she stands at No. 8 in the 200-meter rankings. Her best time in 200 meters for this year is 22.73 seconds, recorded at the Carson Adidas Track Classic last month. The other person to watch is boxer Anuruddha Ratnayake. The flyweight boxer is the first Sri Lankan boxer to be featured in the Olympics in 40 years. Sri Lanka was last represented in boxing at the Mexico City games held in 1968. The Sri Lankan media has already begun a huge ""Go for Gold"" campaign to motivate Ratnayake to bring Sri Lanka its first Olympic medal in boxing in its 60 years of connection with the world's greatest sports show. Another Sri Lankan is making history at this year's Olympics; Thilini Jayasinghe, who becomes the first Sri Lankan women's badminton player ever to represent Sri Lanka at the Olympics. The Sri Lankan public, as well as the athletes, appear not to be happy with the way authorities have committed the necessary support for the athletes in preparation for the Olympics. However, many are of the belief that either Susanthika or Anuruddha will bring honor to their motherland at the Beijing Olympics.","Seven athletes will compete for Sri Lanka at the Beijing Olympics .

"(CNN) -- At least 37 people were killed following a bus crash west of Nairobi, Kenya, police said Thursday. The wreck took place in the predawn hours in Ntulele, when the bus overturned on the Nairobi-Narok highway. At least 32 others suffered multiple injuries and were evacuated to a district hospital, police said. Earlier, the Red Cross had reported 41 killed in the mishap, citing police.

"(CNN) -- Bruce McLaren was eerily portentous when he made his famous statement: ""I feel life is measured in achievement not in years alone."" His eponymous McLaren Formula One team celebrates its 50th anniversary Monday, some 43 years after the New Zealander was killed on the racetrack. McLaren was only 32 years old when he died testing a car for the Can-Am championship but in his short life he broke new ground in motorsport as a popular racer, team manager and forward-thinking engineer. His legacy races on today as the McLaren race team -- winners of a record 182 grands prix and eight team titles in motorsport's elite F1 series. McLaren has also powered a stellar cast of seven world champions including Brazilian hero Ayrton Senna, French four-time winner Alain Prost and the 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton. But for McLaren, the man, it all began at a kitchen table growing up in Auckland. ""Motor racing was in my blood,"" McLaren explained in his autobiography published posthumously on his website. ""How Mum put up with Dad and me with her kitchen table covered in bits and piece of the engine I will never know."" As a child Bruce honed his racing instincts by holding wheelchair races in the grounds of the hospital where he was recovering from a hip disease which left him with a lifelong limp. But once fully recovered he had made the transition to cars by the age of 14. In 1958 he left for England to make his F1 debut at the German Grand Prix in a Cooper-Climax. During the following season, McLaren became the youngest driver to win an F1 race at the U.S. Grand Prix -- a record now held by Red Bull's record-breaking world champion Sebastian Vettel. McLaren, who had more on his mind than racing, had also studied engineering in England and in 1963 he established the Bruce McLaren Motor Racing team, initially to build cars to compete in Australia and New Zealand. His eponymous McLaren marque made its F1 debut on the streets of Monaco in 1966 and two years later McLaren took his orange racer to its first victory at the Belgium Grand Prix. Name on the nose . The speed of McLaren's first victory is amazing given that the teams who joined F1 in 2010 are still to win their first point. ""I didn't know [I had won]!"" McLaren said at the time. ""It's about the nicest thing I've ever been told. ""I had won a Grand Prix in a car with my name on the nose."" McLaren would go on to win 181 more races in F1 -- more than any other team in the history of the sport. The current staff at the team headquarters in Woking, England celebrated that winning mentality and fired up some of the team's historic cars as part of the anniversary celebrations Monday. ""McLaren started as the dream of one man, and it's since grown to encompass the hopes and dreams of more than 2000 men and women, who work as tirelessly as Bruce McLaren himself once did,"" said McLaren Group chairman Ron Dennis. ""[They] ensure that everything we do reflects well when compared with everything we've ever achieved. ""Our 50th anniversary provides an opportunity for every single McLaren employee to realize that he or she is an utterly crucial part of an organization with a history and a culture that really mean something. ""Call it McLaren's DNA... Call it McLaren's undiminished hunger to win in everything we do."" The team's slogan is: ""We exist to win,"" and it is a mantra often repeated by current McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh, even when the team has struggled to compete with its rivals Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. McLaren, who also plan to celebrate their anniversary at the upcoming Italian Grand Prix, do not have a car capable of winning races in 2013. Appetite for winning . Drivers Jenson Button and Sergio Perez have also not been on the podium, representing a backwards step from the 2012 season when the team ended the season with the fastest car. Button, however, remains confident the McLaren powerhouse will turn around their F1 fortunes, especially with a significant rule change on the horizon in 2014. ""I firmly believe this team will be great again,"" said Button, who has won eight races since joining McLaren in 2010. ""This is an organization you can never discount -- their appetite for winning is unlike anything I've ever seen and, rest assured, we will be back at the front soon."" While the team's founder may have been driven by his racing ambitions the company now does not rely on success in F1 alone. Dennis, who merged his own race team with McLaren in 1981, has been an influential driving force behind the modern McLaren brand. The company, which also has Bahraini and Saudi Arabian shareholders, not only competes in F1 but produces luxury sports cars while McLaren Applied Technologies has seen F1 technology cross over in medicine and the military. The team even create its own cartoons. McLaren may be measuring 50 years since the fresh-faced Bruce McLaren decided to build his own cars and go racing -- but the team have followed their founder's mantra by marking their achievements in more than just numbers.","Bruce McLaren founded his eponymous race team in 1963 .

"(CNN) -- Since her debut with the New York Philharmonic at the age of eight, Sarah Chang has grown through the weight of expectation to become one of the world's great violinists. Now aged 31, Chang was born in Philadelphia to a composer and music teacher of Korean descent. She first dabbled with the piano at the age of three, before opting for the violin a year later. By five she had been accepted into New York's prestigious Juilliard School for Performing Arts. By her own acknowledgment, the world of grand orchestras and opera houses that she has so long inhabited can be ""very formal"" and ""exclusive."" This perhaps goes some way to explain her choice of destination for her ""Fusion Journey"" challenge: Buenos Aires. Here, in the hot-blooded Argentinean capital, she would meet with local band ""Orquesta Tipica Andariega,"" to learn first-hand the sensual and mysterious art of tango. See more Fusion Journeys . During her visit, Chang was challenged to produce a fusion of sound that blended the traditions of Western classical music with tango's emotionally raw and folksy heritage. She says that the process has given her performance a new-found sense of intimacy that she's carried ever since. In her own words, Chang tells the story of her Fusion Journey. Sarah Chang: I've been trained as a classical violinist my entire life. It's all about structure, all about technique. It's very much a polished profession. But tango music, although it has some classical elements, is very sexy and rough and, in a way, from the earth. When you walk along the streets of Buenos Aires, fun is in the air. You see children with barely anything on their feet playing soccer, and there is music on every corner. They are playing all sorts of Latin sounds; they're all dancing and drinking; they're enjoying life; they are loving life. One of the cornerstones of tango is definitely the dancing, so I first met up with dance instructor Nora Schvartz. Now, I'm not really a dancer. I'm a very physical performer when I'm on stage, but of course tango is a completely different thing to thrusting around when you're performing as a violinist. I learned that the best tango dancers move not just with their legs and arms, but from their guts. That's the sign of a true art form, and it's the source of so much beauty, so much soul and passion. Even though I absolutely cannot dance -- just watch the footage! -- I always thought that to experience the whole picture, you really have to open up your vulnerabilities, and sort of take that risk. Read related: Photographer's Lapland journey highlights global warming . Tango is -- in a sense -- imperfect ... albeit beautifully imperfect. It's not about being always metronomically on time, it's about spontaneity and freedom. I've worked, of course, with a piano and an orchestra before -- but never with a band. All of a sudden I find myself rehearsing with the ""Orquesta Tipica Andariega,"" an extremely talented local tango group. So there I was, playing songs I'd never played before, alongside instruments I'd never heard before, with a group I'd never met before -- it was thrilling! The piece we chose for our fusion was by Carlos Gardel -- the biggest name in the history of tango. The tune itself is very famous -- it's used in all these movies, you name it, any famous tango scene. But as far as I know, there is no version for a band with a solo violinist, so I asked a composer friend of mine to make an arrangement for us. I was really thrilled with the result. We performed it in this intimate little club and it felt so immediate. Everyone was there, drinking wine, dancing, looking so happy. There were no rigid rules, none of this ""clap here, oh you have to be quiet here."" Instead, the audience were whistling and yelling and clapping along -- it felt like they were right up there with us. Literally, if I just stretched my arm, I could touch them, they were so close. That sort of intimacy, that sort of physical closeness, the fact that they were dancing when we were playing, I just thought was so beautiful. ""Fusions"" can often turn out badly -- I can think of some fusion cuisine that I wish I could forget! But when each side brings just the right balance of their experience, their culture and personality, then I think it can be magical -- and the only way you know it has worked is when everyone has a smile on their face. Classical music is one of the world's longest-standing traditional forms of music-making out there -- and I don't think it will, or should, change over night. There is a sort of purity in what classical musicians do that I cherish very much and want to preserve. But the big thing that I really took from this experience is that sense of connecting with the audience. Quite often, in grand concert halls where everyone is wearing elegant ball gowns and black tails -- that kind of old-Hollywood glamor -- it can feel like there is a big distance between the audience and the performers, a sense of ""look, but don't touch."" But with Argentinean tango, it's the opposite. They are saying ""please touch, please come into and share my world."" Now, every concert that I do, I try to utilize that, I try to connect with every single last person in the balcony on an emotional and personal level.","American violinist Sarah Chang flew to Buenos Aires to immerse herself in tango .

"Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama considers military action in response to Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, a debate over whether he must seek Congress' consent has surfaced. It's a debate with which the president is extremely familiar. As a senator, Obama was a staunch critic of President George W. Bush for not obtaining renewed authorization for the war in Iraq. He blasted his predecessor in 2007, saying, ""The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation."" Additionally, as a candidate for president, Obama reaffirmed that sentiment. He told the Boston Globe in a questionnaire, ""The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation."" ""It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action,"" Obama added at the time. Syria: Western intervention looms after reported chemical attack . As a senator, Vice President Joe Biden had a similar take. During a campaign speech in Iowa in 2007, he said ""the consequences of war -- intended or otherwise -- can be so profound and complicated that our founding fathers vested in Congress, not the president, the power to initiate war, except to repel an imminent attack on the United States or its citizens."" Although they have held such strong views in the past, their positions have dramatically changed. They did not seek Congressional consent when the United States engaged its military in Libya, nor when Obama expanded the war in Afghanistan. In both instances, members of Congress complained loudly, but the president defended his decision. Iran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark 'disaster' In the case of Libya, the president said at the time that U.S. troops would not be on the ground and so the law didn't apply. Why the change of heart? ""Where you stand on this issue depends on where you sit, and right now (Obama) is sitting in the Oval Office,"" said Kal Raustiala, professor of law at UCLA. It's a long-running battle of checks and balances. And it's one that the president usually wins. Opinion: On Syria, learn from U.S. mistakes in Iraq . The debate revolves around the War Powers Resolution. Congress passed the measure in 1973, overriding a veto by President Richard Nixon. It was meant to rein in the president's ability to involve the United States in overseas conflict. The law requires that the president seek consent from Congress before force is used or within 60 days of the start of hostilities and that the president provides Congress with reports throughout the conflict. It hasn't really worked that way. Many in Congress want consultation before action in Syria . It's a debate that has played out time and time again in U.S. history: a president is considering intervening in an international conflict, Congress wants a say. Specifically, congressional opponents want the ability to block the intended military action. Since 1973, the United States has used military force in Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989, Iraq in 1991, Haiti in 1994 and Kosovo in 1999. In all those instances, presidents -- both Democrats and Republicans -- sidestepped Congress and committed U.S. military forces without obtaining Congressional approval. Congress did, however, provide Bush with its approval for the war in Iraq in 2002 and the war in Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Like a replay of the past, some members of Congress are demanding the president seek the legislative branch's approval before any action is taken in Syria. But it's highly unlikely the president will take that formal step. Warnings of quagmire in Syria as U.S. contemplates military action . Congress complains, sometimes loudly, but has rarely done anything about it. It could pass laws further restricting the president's authority, but hasn't done so. The legislative branch could also withhold funding of any military conflict, but that's another avenue it has failed to take. Additionally, the judiciary has been reluctant to settle the dispute. In the White House's daily briefing, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration is consulting with Congress. Obama ""had discussions with relevant members of Congress, and leaders of committees and leaders of the Congress at large,"" he said. Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . In response to Carney's statement, Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, who called military action without congressional approval ""unconstitutional"" and is among a group of lawmakers who are demanding the president seek their approval, tweeted, ""yeah right."" But while members are likely to write letters, pontificate and even challenge the president to seek consent, the president is likely to continue to sit on the winning side of the issue.

"(CNN) -- Egyptian security forces arrested a senior Muslim Brotherhood leader on suspicion of inciting violence after last month's ouster of then-President Mohamed Morsy, state-run media reported Thursday. Mohamed El-Beltagi was arrested in Giza province, state-run newspaper Al-Ahram reported.

In many cases, those arrested have been accused of inciting violence. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? Egypt has been in turmoil since the military ousted Morsy in early July. The military and Morsy opponents have battled Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters. This month, hundreds of people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed. Many of the deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo, and when violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations two days later.

"(CNN) -- A 5.9-magnitude earthquake killed at least four people Saturday morning in southwestern China, state media reported. Officials reported 10 injuries as emergency teams began to respond, the Xinhua News Agency said. The state-owned news agency quoted Yunnan provincial officials as saying that 600 residential units collapsed. An additional 55,000 residential units were damaged, and 9,200 people had been forced to relocate, Xinhua reported. The quake -- with a depth of 10 kilometers -- hit in remote areas near the border of the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Roads were blocked in some villages by boulders rolling down mountains, and 17 people on three tourist buses were trapped by landslides, Xinhua said. The Civil Affairs Ministry in Yunnan province was sending tents and clothing, Xinhua said. The epicenter was near Benzilan Township, the USGS reported. ""We are heading to Benzilan,"" Liao Wencai, vice secretary of the Deqen County Committee of the Communist Party of China, told Xinhua. ""The telecommunication there has been cut off, and many residents cannot be reached by mobile phone.""

"London (CNN) -- As the United States and its allies wrestle with how to respond to the possibility that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons against its own people, a new poll for CNN finds Washington's European allies distinctly lukewarm on military intervention. The French are more willing than the British or the Germans to launch missile strikes on Syria, but even there, only one in three people backs bombing. One out of five Germans is in favor of missile strikes, while the number is even lower in the United Kingdom, at 16%. France's parliament is due to debate possible action on Syria on Wednesday. Last week, Britain's House of Commons rejected even the possibility of a military strike on Syria, in a vote that shocked Prime Minister David Cameron and raised questions about the so-called ""special relationship"" between Washington and London. President Obama is lobbying members of Congress to back military action against Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad is accused of using chemical weapons on August 21. President Obama had said in the past that the use of chemical weapons would be a ""red line."" The survey, conducted by the polling agency ComRes for CNN on August 30 -- after the British vote -- found economic sanctions to be the most popular course of action in all three countries polled. More than half of Germans -- 55% -- backed tightening economic sanctions , while 46% of British people and 39% of French people did. Poll respondents were allowed to choose more than one option from a list of ""most appropriate responses,"" which included tightening sanctions, establishing a no-fly zone over Syria, striking Syria with missiles, invading with a ground force and doing nothing. More than one in five Germans favored doing nothing (22%), as did more than one in four French people (27%) and nearly one in three British people (30%). But about half of British people said it would be appropriate for their country to engage in military intervention if the United Nations found evidence Assad had used chemical weapons or if the U.N. explicitly sanctioned the use of force. Just under half of German people agreed, as did 35% of French respondents. The poll did throw up some surprising paradoxes. Germans were the most likely of the three countries to say they should not engage in military intervention under any circumstances -- but also the most likely to say that military intervention could help stop Assad from using chemical weapons in the future and enable positive regime change. The poll was conducted online on August 30, sampling 500 adults each in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Data were weighted to be demographically representative by age, gender and region of all UK, French and German adults aged 18 and up. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.38 percentage points.

"(CNN) -- In Somalia, getting from point A to B can be a perilous business. Towns are remote, the roads that link them are poor and prone to attack, while the coastline is manned by pirates. So why are so many airline operators eager to launch routes to Mogadishu? Despite Somalia's many security woes, the aviation industry is experiencing an uptick. Mogadishu's Aden Abdulle International Airport -- which was essentially out of commission prior to 2010 following years of civil war, in-fighting and a reign of terror brought on by Al Qaeda -backed terrorist group Al Shabaab -- has been expanding. ""Before 2010, there wasn't really an airport, just a runway. Now, we have 35 flights a day. The airport is booming,"" says Sean Mendis, Aden Abdulle's station manager. Security in the country is an on-going concern, though it has improved. Al Shabaab was forced out two years ago, allowing some local businesses to reopen and Aden Abdulle to beef up its security, which is currently under the purview of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), the Somalia Civil Aviation and Meteorology Authority, the Somali police, the Somali National Security Agency, and SKA International Group -- the consulting firm charged with the airline's renaissance. ""The airport is very different from the town. There are 17,000 troops protecting it. We have four x-ray machines and several security checks passengers have to pass through before boarding a plane,"" explains Mendis. These measures has given confidence to a range of carriers. Jubba Airways -- Somalia's unofficial national carrier -- has expanded its network and fleet considerably, and several neighboring outfits, like African Express and Fly540, have daily flights throughout the country. Last month, Air Uganda started flying three times a week to Mogadishu, and last year, Turkish Airways became the first major commercial airline to service the Somali capital in over 20 years. Mendis envisions more international carriers, particularly some of the Middle East's heavy hitters, launching routes soon. Watch: Turning around African aviation . Still, violence remains an everyday reality. Last month a car bomb was driven into a convoy of AMISOM troops near the airport. If anything, the country's lack of infrastructure and stability is actually boosting the airline industry. ""The population is sparsely distributed throughout the territory. Traveling by land is dangerous -- not just because the roads are bad, but because of highway robbery. Police checkpoints charge you $50 just to pass through. For ordinary people, as well as UN peacekeepers, flying domestically is really the best way to go,"" says Christos Shepherd, head of business development and start-up airlines at aviation consulting firm Mango Aviation Partners. For big carriers, like Turkish Airlines, flying to Somalia represents a bigger strategy of gaining a foothold in Africa as a whole. In 2012, the airline expanded its network to include 15 destinations throughout the continent. ""The most important geographic part of the world over the next 100 years will be Africa. In this respect, any destination (we fly to) in Africa will create more effective results than, say, a destination in Europe,"" says Ali Genc, Turkish Airlines' senior vice president of media relations. Despite the increase in competition, airfares remain remarkably high. Even low-cost carriers charge upwards of $500 for internal flights. ""For the airlines operating these routes, the costs are very high -- much higher than they would be flying similar-sized aircraft with the same number of passengers in Europe, because you don't have the infrastructure, plus you're paying a premium to pilots and crew for being in a place they don't want to be,"" says Shepherd. Read more: The worst airports for delays . According to Ruben Gamero, the director of operations for African Express, combat pay is a common incentive for pilots. ""All operators flying to Somalia have to be given a special permit, because the country is considered a hostile destination. We take into account every factor and calculated risk, and have never been involved in any unsafe or unstable situation,"" he says. Surprisingly for a country whose economy is in shambles, there are plenty of passengers willing to pay the fare. ""Somalis are very resilient, and they get a lot of money from the diaspora,"" explains Mendis, who adds that U.N. and NGO traffic keeps the demand for seats high. African Express cites 90% occupancy, and Turkish Airlines says the load factor is increasing. ""Judging by the amount of traffic the airport is seeing, I'd say there's plenty of profits to be had,"" says Mendis.","Business at Mogadishu's airport is ""booming"", with up to 35 flights scheduled each day.
Last year, Turkish Airlines was the the first major carrier to fly to Mogadishu 25 years.
Airlines are heartened by the tight airport security. Currently 17,000 troops protect the airport.
Pilots and crew are paid more for operating in what is still classified as a hostile destination ."
"Lebanon (CNN) -- As world leaders debate what to do about Syria, one thing remains clear -- the plight and suffering of the people is only getting worse. According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 Syrians have died in the conflict and about 2 million Syrians have fled their country, mostly to Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. An estimated 6.8 million people are in desperate need inside Syria. As an aid worker for Mercy Corps for over a decade, I can attest that this is a humanitarian disaster of historic proportions. Mercy Corps is already supporting nearly 2 million people affected by the crisis, and we are now working around the clock to prepare for a variety of possible scenarios that could play out in the coming days or weeks. Although we haven't seen any significant change in the number of refugees crossing into Lebanon and Jordan yet, one likely scenario is a significant increase in refugees, and possibly a flood of families fleeing the violence in Syria. These refugees will have immediate emergency needs -- like food, shelter, water and medical and psychological care -- but neighboring countries that are already hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees are overwhelmed and struggling to support any newcomers. I see firsthand the tremendous burden the Syrian refugees are already placing on countries like Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, and most recently Iraq. Their limited natural resources are being tapped, their economies are suffering and their own citizens are feeling the strain. In Lebanon the influx has caused a spike in the cost of rent, food and basic necessities, and a drop in household incomes as refugees, desperate for work, accept lower than standard wages. I recently met Ali Ahmad Obeid, a Lebanese small business owner, who has been running a carpentry shop for the past 14 years. Before the conflict, he had five employees and his business was thriving. But in the past two years, his business has suffered. He told me: ""I used to rent my shop for 350 thousand Lebanese Liras, now the price is double. I can't afford the rent and I had to let my employees go... I can barely feed my children."" This all creates tensions between the host communities and the refugees that has an additional destabilizing effect on the region, and that's a serious problem. The humanitarian response needs to address longer-term needs like creating jobs, while still providing urgently needed immediate assistance. Despite these challenges, host countries and the international aid community are building transit reception areas to accommodate incoming refugees who may have to wait for immigration processing and registration in the case of a massive influx of new arrivals. In Jordan, we are working closely with the U.N. and other aid organizations to prepare a new refugee camp (Azraq camp) located east of Amman. We are accelerating our work on providing water and child-friendly spaces, and the camp is scheduled to open in the next two weeks. It will accommodate 30,000 refugees upon opening, and can expand to accommodate up to 130,000 refugees. Mercy Corps has pre-positioned aid packages for new refugees, who often arrive with only the clothes they are wearing. Mattresses, blankets, hygiene kits and baby-kits are on stand-by to meet a possible increased need. We are also expanding our child protection programs to ensure young refugees have access to psychosocial support and activities they desperately need to recover from the traumatic events they experience. With no solution to the crisis on the horizon, the hope of refugees being able to return home anytime soon is remote. I've spoken with hundreds of refugees over the past year and most of them are realizing it will be a long haul. The majority of them don't see how the divisions that wrack Syria will be mended, but no one I have talked with has given up on their dream of returning. 'Slow response' Ehmad, a teenager from Homs who came to Lebanon over a year ago, told me he was so homesick that he actually tried to return. Despite the fighting, he went back to Homs and found his neighborhood destroyed and totally deserted, and couldn't stay. Back in Lebanon, Ehmad told me he no longer cares who wins. ""I just want the fighting to stop so we can go home and restore our country,"" he said. Currently, the Syrian humanitarian crisis is woefully underfunded. From a private donor standpoint, Mercy Corps has raised just over $1 million for our Syria refugee work, mostly from a handful of major donors, but that is over two years. For the earthquake in Kashmir (2005) we raised more than $8 million in private donations in about two months. Without the necessary funding to run desperately needed programs, I am seeing more and more Syrian families and children facing desperate conditions. Donor response to slow-onset, conflict-related humanitarian emergencies is always slow compared to rapid-onset natural disasters -- but giving to the Syrian crisis has been exceptionally slow. That said, giving has picked up recently as media coverage has intensified and we are reaching out aggressively to find the resources required to help families fleeing the violence. However, as the conflict wears into a third year, governments and individuals need to make more funding available -- not only to the immediate crisis, but for longer-term solutions that include livelihoods and other economic enabling opportunities, and education for over a million refugee children. It is also critical that neighboring countries keep their borders open to Syrians who need to flee the conflict, despite the challenges that these massive, mobile populations can bring with them. Syrians are desperate, and their challenges will almost certainly get worse before they get better. This is the most complex humanitarian crisis of our time and it is more critical than ever that the international community strengthen its support.

"(CNN) -- Mention DR Congo, Sub-Saharan Africa's largest country, and what comes to mind? Probably conflict minerals, proxy wars, the rape capital of the world, or the trigger for the 19th century ""Scramble for Africa."" But beyond the despair, there is another country; a country not like any other country in the world -- a country with rich ancient traditions, a colorful cultural energy and creativity, amazing potential and much, much more. Read this: Africa's new skyscraper megacities . Ask historians or archaeologists -- one of the earliest known mathematical objects, the Ishango bone, was not made in Ancient Greece, Mesopotamia or Renaissance Europe but around Congo's Lake Edward around 18,000 BC. It is certainly difficult to picture this today: thirty-two years of dictatorship followed by wars, invasions and bad governance reduced Congo from being a potential economic powerhouse to one of the world's poorest countries. But little by little, individuals and organizations in and outside Congo are creating glimmers of hope. The future of Congo still looks more exciting than its past and with a bit more push we can tilt the balance and awaken the world to a century, if not centuries, of ""Made in Africa."" Below are six reasons why saving the Congo is critical. Congo's strategic position in the continent . Congo's unique geo-strategic position, more than its gold, diamonds and coltan reserves, makes it of interest to anyone with a keen eye for Africa's future. Neighboring nine other countries at all four cardinal points, Congo sits right at the crossroads of African democratization and development, as well as the intersection of a series of real and potential security dilemmas. This means whatever happens in Congo could have an impact across the continent. And a stable and functioning Congo could trigger prosperity and development throughout Africa, and most critically, play a role in assuring security in the Horn of Africa and elsewhere in the continent. Helping to make famine in Africa history . Congo's vast, fertile agricultural land has tremendous potential to make it the breadbasket for the entire African continent. If Congo's fertile land were used effectively it could lift millions out of extreme poverty in a continent where malnutrition and food insecurity are rife. But this potential has barely been tapped. In spite of climatic conditions favorable for farming and abundant water resources, only a small proportion of Congo's arable land and pasture lands is under cultivation. Bad governance and decay of the transportation infrastructure -- in particular the road networks through which production could be distributed around the country -- continue to prove a challenge and the consequences have not been short of a disaster. The Global Hunger Index lists Congo as the world's hungriest country in its 2009, 2010 and 2011 reports, and UNICEF says Congo has the highest rate of malnutrition in Central and West Africa, affecting 43% of children under five. Congo Rainforest . The Congo Basin rainforest, one of the natural wonders of the world, is sometimes described as one of the Earth's lungs -- the other being South America's Amazon. Home to 10,000 species of plants (of which 3,000 are found nowhere else), it features mesmerizing scenery, restless landscapes, waterfalls, a mosaic of savannahs, swamp forests and some of the most spectacular and endangered wildlife in the world. The forest plays a crucial role in regulating climate, both locally and globally, but recent industrial logging, resource extraction and proxy wars are threatening this fragile ecosystem. As things stand, there are 20 million hectares of logging titles in Congo -- an area the size of Ghana. For more than half of Congo's population who rely on the forest for food, medicine, fresh water, shelter and customary tradition, this is humanitarian havoc in slow motion. For the global climate, it could be a catastrophe. Read more: Fight to save Africa's rainforests . Fishing and tourism . If Congo could be known by a different name, that name, I think, should the country of lakes. Rich in aquatic biodiversity and holding more than half of Africa's water reserves, including four of the continent's great lakes, as well as Africa's longest and deepest freshwater lake -- Lake Tanganika -- Congo's lakes and rivers, if coupled with the needed infrastructure to fulfill its potential, could be a breadbasket for the region. With more than 700 species of fish recorded in the Congo Basin -- the world's second-largest river basin -- the potential for commercial fishing in these lakes and rivers is great. However, the ripple of potential does not stop there; tourism is another side of the coin. Congo's lakes and rivers, along with its rolling lush hills and valleys, could potentially transform Congo into a huge tourist attraction, creating jobs and businesses for the region. Lighting up Africa, from Cape to Cairo . Electricity is said to be the lifeblood of human society and economic development, but 550 million Africans have no access to electricity. They rely on wood, dung and crop waste for their daily energy needs -- and that costs lives. Burning dirty fuels in poorly ventilated homes causes 1.6 million people around the world to die prematurely each year. Yet, astonishingly, the Congo River has the potential to light up the entire African continent from Cape to Cairo, without further polluting the planet or worsening climate change. Wildlife . Congo's unspoiled wildlife diversity is perhaps the country's most fascinating feature. Whether by 4x4 drives or river tours by pirogue, Congo offers an ideal wildlife destination for nature lovers. Home to big cats as well as 1,000 bird species, 900 species of butterflies, 400 species of mammals (including more than 80% of African primates), half of the continent's remaining elephants, 280 species of reptiles, 216 species of amphibians, forest antelopes and forest pigs -- with more species being discovered -- the Congo Basin is by any measure an essential feature of a healthy planet. But instability, industrial logging and poaching are threatening the very existence of some of these animals, including some of the country's most famous residents such as the shy, endangered okapi, the owl-faced monkey, the beautifully patterned bongo, the sliverback gorilla, the bonobo and the dazzling Congo peacock. Nonetheless, it's not too late to save these species. And it's not too late to save the Congo, and help it realize the potential it has always had. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vava Tampa.","DR Congo has a reputation for conflict and violence .
Campaigner and Congo native Vava Tampa says there's another side to the country .
It has immense natural beauty thanks to its rainforests and wildlife .

"(CNN) -- Feet stumbling in the pitch darkness over the uneven ground we make our way with a group of women to one of the bathrooms in the Zaatari camp. ""There is no light, if we come in here there could be a guy hiding or something."" one woman says. None of them want to be identified. They carry fear of the regime with them, even as they seek refuge across the border in Jordan. But ""safety"" is a relative term. For Syria's female refugee population, it has meant trading fear of death in their homeland for fear of something many consider to be worse: rape. There have been various stories of sexual harassment and rape in Zaatari camp -- teeming with masses who continue to stream across the border. This dark underbelly of crisis has led to a disturbing growing phenomenon: ""sutra"" marriages, or marriages for protection. Families who feel like they are unable to safeguard their female family members, their daughters, are marrying them off to protect them. In a culture where conserving honor is central, everyone says they had no other choice. In one trailer we meet 13-year-old Najwa. She curls back in the corner next to her husband, 19-year-old Khaled, and her mother, hardly saying a word. Najwa is the youngest of three, her two older sisters in their late teens are also recently married. ""I swear I wasn't able to sleep, I was afraid for the girls."" Her mother tells us. ""I swear to God, I would not have let her get married this young if we were still in Syria."" ""There were rapes,"" Khaled adds. We approach the culturally delicate subject of sex with a vaguely worded question about the age difference and plans for children. ""It's okay, I do not want children now,"" Khaled says. ""I will make it up to her, I will make up for not having a (wedding) party."" Ruwaida dresses brides inside Zaatari -- a business she had back home in Syria. She says that marriage at 13 was rare in Syria, but here she sees it more and more frequently. Across the board, even for what should be a joyous occasion there is always sorrow. When the brides are children themselves, it's even worse. ""I feel like I have a child between my hands and she is having to take on a responsibility bigger than she is."" Ruwaida says. ""I feel like her life is over, her life is ending early."" The same fears exist for those families living outside the camp. On a tour with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) we meet 14-year-old Eman. She has such a sweet young face, flushed with exhaustion as she cradles her baby. ""I wouldn't have gotten married, it's because of the situation."" She speaks softly, her eyes filled with regret and pain well beyond her years. ""I told my son not to consummate the marriage, but he didn't listen,"" her mother-in-law whispers. She too was wed for protection. More: Forced to marry at age 14 . Farrah Sukkar, herself a Syrian refugee and SAMS volunteer, estimates there has been an increase of 60% in young teen marriages. The added worry not just because of the young age of the girls, but medical as well. Many are having children before their own bodies are fully developed. The SAMS team goes house to house in Amman and other areas of Jordan trying to determine what aid refugees need, but also to pinpoint vulnerable cases. One woman we meet has 13 children. Two of her daughters are teenagers and she's so afraid of leaving them at home alone that she hasn't been able to leave the house to vaccinate her baby. Despite their best efforts, Syria's neighbours like Jordan can't handle the influx of refugees. Aid organizations are running out of funding. More: Saying no to child marriage . Predators also lurk in areas where refugees are known to gather looking for humanitarian aid. Their desperation is palpable, with aid agencies both local and international unable to meet the needs, and they will latch on to anyone who promises help. Mariam and her 10-year-old daughter were at a hospital providing free care for refugees when she overheard a man on the phone talking about free housing for refugees. She and the other women there clamored around him, thinking their prayers had been answered. The man loaded three cars with women, including Mariam and her daughter. She quickly felt that something was wrong. At their destination, a house in the city of Zarqa, a 45-minute drive from the capital, she refused to enter. Another man came out, and pointing to her, told the driver, she recalls him saying: ""Why did you bring me this one? You brought me an old lady. Then he pointed to the other ladies and asked, 'are you married?'"" Mariam began to feel increasingly terrified as she began to piece together exactly what this house was and asked the man for a glass of water, leaving her alone on the patio. She peered through the window. ""All the girls were scantily dressed."" She remembers, her hands twisting nervously. ""And I saw two men come in and pick two girls and walk out."" Horrified, she managed to flee with her daughter and the other women with her. The international community may be unwilling or unable to end the conflict in Syria. But there is a solution to preventing the exploitation of the Syrian female refugee population: more aid. ""We left Syria to escape death and we found something worse than death"" Mariam says, hugging her daughter close. ""If we had stayed in Syria to die it would have been more honorable. There death is fast, here it is slow."" More: Child bride: 'I was sold for $1,000 .

"(CNN) -- Former CBS News correspondent Bruce Dunning died Monday from injuries suffered in a fall, CBS News said. He was 73. The longtime foreign correspondent retired in 2005 after 35 years at CBS News. He spent most of his career reporting from Asia, where he opened the Beijing bureau in 1981, and became the network's Tokyo-based Asia bureau chief in 1989, CBS said. Dunning was best known for a 1975 report on the last flight out of Da Nang toward the end of the Vietnam War, the network said. His video showed throngs of people storming the plane, hoping for a ride. He returned to Vietnam to cover the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the fall of South Vietnam, CBS said. Dunning earned degrees from Princeton and Columbia University. He began his career as a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times in Florida, CBS said. He lived in Union City, New Jersey and died at Mt.

"Boston (CNN) -- Two friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty Tuesday in federal court to charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstructing justice with intent to impede authorities. Handcuffed and dressed in orange jail jumpsuits, Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov both voiced their not guilty pleas on each of the counts during their roughly four-minute arraignment Tuesday in Boston. They remained in handcuffs afterward, when they were led out of court. The two 19-year-old roommates and Kazakh nationals began attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth the same semester as Tsarnaev. They were taken into custody this spring along with Robel Phillipos, a friend of Tsarnaev's from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Authorities accuse them of helping Tsarnaev after the deadly April 15 blasts by taking items from his southern Massachusetts dorm room to keep them from investigators. This occurred shortly before Tsarnaev himself was taken into custody after a tense, late-night standoff in Watertown, Massachusetts. He and his brother -- who died after a confrontation with police -- are accused of planting two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line that left three people dead and more than 260 wounded, then killing a campus police officer days later. On April 18, three days before the FBI searched Tsarnaev's dorm room, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev allegedly went into the dorm, took Tsarnaev's laptop as well as a backpack containing Vaseline, a thumb drive, fireworks and a ""homework assignment sheet"" and took them back to their New Bedford apartment, the federal indictment against them states. Timeline: Boston Marathon bombing . ""The fireworks container has been opened and manipulated,"" the indictment says. ""As a result, some of the explosive powder was visible."" Kadyrbayev told his roommate that he believed Tsarnaev ""used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect,"" according to the indictment. That day, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text message from Tsarnaev that read, in part, ""If yu want yu can go to my room and take what's there"" followed by a smiley face emoticon. Either that night or early the next day, Kadyrbayev tossed the backpack in a Dumpster, according to the charges. After Tuesday's brief court hearing, Kadyrbayev's lawyer, Robert Stahl, said his client ""had no intent to assist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev."" An ethnic Chechen, Tsarnaev spoke Russian like Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov. ""As Dias' family prays for the victims, they also pray for justice for their son, a law-abiding college student whose only crime was befriending a fellow student who spoke his more comfortable native language,"" Stahl said later Tuesday in a statement, insisting his client ""fully cooperated"" with authorities right after they approached him. And Arkady Bukh, Tazhayakov's attorney, has previously said his client did not touch any of Tsarnaev's items. As for Phillipos, he is free on $100,000 bond and being monitored electronically, according to terms set this spring and agreed to by his lawyers and prosecutors. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev himself is awaiting trial, having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges tied to the bombing and the subsequent pursuit of him and his brother. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyer: Suspect's ""only crime"" was befriending someone who spoke Russian .

"Washington (CNN) -- Jack Germond, the cantankerous political journalist whose brand of shoe-leather reporting made him a legend of the form, died on Wednesday. He was 85. Germond died ""peacefully and quickly,"" having just completed a novel, his wife, Alice, wrote in a note to friends. ""He lived a marvelous, full and well loved life,"" she wrote, adding: ""To his many friends, he appreciated the great company, story, scoop, competition and laughter. He fit his life and times so very well. I love him and it's been great."" Germond was a fixture on the national political scene in print and broadcast, including for CNN, as a political analyst beginning in the 1990s. A longtime newspaperman, the Boston native began covering national politics with the 1960 presidential election that saw John F. Kennedy enter the White House. He spent 20 years with Gannett Newspapers, the final four as Washington bureau chief. He came to embody the persona of a grizzled, ink-stained campaign reporter, and was one of the ""Boys on the Bus"" featured in Timothy Crouse's 1973 book detailing life on the presidential campaign trail. In interviews, Germond fondly recalled covering politicians and candidates from the ground - including getting to know the subjects he was following over dinner and drinks. ""In the old days, journalists got to know politicians better than they do now,"" he told People Magazine in 2001, describing a bygone era of occasionally meeting candidates over steak dinners, vodka martinis and late night poker games. ""Jack's appetite was legendary -- for news, for stories, for food, and for washing it down,"" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King remembered on Wednesday. Germond came to embrace the hard-charging reputation, as well as the girth that lifestyle produced, in memoirs with the titles ""Fat Man in a Middle Seat: Forty Years of Covering Politics"" and ""Fat Man Fed Up: How American Politics Went Bad."" ""I think he was a great reporter. I know he was a hearty eater, and the good conversation as important as the food,"" his wife wrote in her note. ""And yes, he enjoyed extending an evening. He had a bold journalistic ethic, and that matters."" He worked for eight years with The Washington Star and, after the Star folded in 1981, moved on to the Washington bureau of The Baltimore Sun. With Jules Witcover, he wrote the syndicated ""Politics Today"" column for more than two decades, and he was a regular on the political panel TV show ""The McLaughlin Group"" in the 1980s and 1990s. ""For Jack Germond, covering politics was a calling, a passion, a profession and a full-time pastime,"" said Ken Bode, a former national political correspondent for NBC News and a former senior correspondent at CNN. ""On the road, he was the best company -- a couple of pops, a steak and an evening of swapping stories. Jack had an extra political gene that enabled him to recognize the rogues of the political world, but he had just as much fun covering the rascals as he did the serious people,"" he said. But as technology assumed a larger role for journalists - and campaigns began to restrict access to candidates - Germond grew less and less enthusiastic about the national political scene. ""Journalism was a great way to make a living,"" he told People. ""It was fun. Nowadays, reporters drink white wine and eat salads. They go to their rooms, transcribe their notes and go to the gym. We never did that."" King recalled that Germond had a ""visceral disdain for cell phones and Blackberries and reporters who spent more time with their 'toys' than wandering the back rooms of events talking and listening."" Yet Germond was also known for encouraging new journalists as they joined the pack of political reporters following candidates. He gave CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger her first job in journalism at The Washington Star, where he was managing editor. ""On the campaign trail, he always took newbie reporters under his wing, and traveling with him on campaigns was a joyous way to learn American politics,"" Borger said. ""He loved his job and elections and reporting, and it showed in every column he wrote and every TV appearance he made."" King also described a man willing to encourage a new generation of campaign reporters, describing an evening at the bar of the Sheraton Wayfarer in New Hampshire while covering the state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary. ""I was 24, my first presidential campaign, and had spent the night in awe listening to Jack and (fellow reporter) Walter Mears tell old stories of Kennedy and McGovern and Reagan,"" King said. ""'You're going to do OK kid,' he said as he shuffled off to his room -- the inference being if you can close the bar with that crew you had made the right career choice."" Candy Crowley, now CNN's chief political correspondent, said she first saw Germond ""in a temporary White House press room in a hotel somewhere."" ""I called a friend and said, 'I can't believe it. I'm in the same room as Jack Germond,'"" Crowley said. ""He was already a legend. I was new to everything and it seemed to me that Jack knew everything."" ""I saw him many times after that in press rooms or in Iowa or New Hampshire,"" she continued. ""So many people describe him as a curmudgeon, a tough journalist with no patience for BS, particularly from politicians. He was all that, but the Jack I knew had a twinkle in his eye and was consistently sweet and kind to me. I was in awe. I still am."" People we've lost in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Harry Reems, the porn star best known for playing Dr. Young in the 1972 adult film classic ""Deep Throat,"" died Tuesday, according to a spokeswoman at a Salt Lake City hospital. Reems, whose real name was Herbert Streicher, was 65. Reems, who appeared in numerous pornographic films in the 1970s and '80s, was a pioneer whose battle for First Amendment rights paved the way for the adult film industry to enter the mainstream, said fellow actor Ron Jeremy. Jill Atwood, spokeswoman for George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center in Salt Lake City, would not disclose the cause of death for privacy reasons. Reems' big break came in 1972 on the set of ""Deep Throat"" when the actor cast to play the feisty Dr. Young failed to show up for filming. Reems was promoted from extra to co-star, which meant an unforgettable sex scene with leading lady Linda Lovelace. The film's budget of $25,000 included just a few hundred dollars for Reems, but the notoriety of the movie -- highlighted by well-publicized legal troubles -- made him one of the top porn stars in the United States in the 1970s. Reems, who grew up in the New York's Bronx, ""was the original,"" Jeremy said. ""It was Reems and John Holmes. They were the biggest names at the time."" ""Everyone who has ever seen a porn film knows who Harry Reems is,"" Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt told CNN through his representative. ""He was an icon from the beginning of the erotic film industry."" ""Deep Throat"" went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars after criminal investigations and the prosecution of Reems for obscenity and conspiracy brought it global attention. His obscenity conviction was overturned on appeal, but the legal battle became an important First Amendment fight for some in Hollywood. The battle over ""Deep Throat"" became a ""cause celebre,"" said Paul Fishbein, founder of AVN (Adult Video News). ""Because Harry Reems was famous for 'Deep Throat,' I think people forget he was sort of the face of '70s obscenity,"" said Fishbein, who is now president of X3Sixty Network, a cable network dedicated to programming about the adult industry. ""When he got indicted for that movie, it was a big deal."" Hollywood stars including Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty supported Reems' defense, Jeremy said. ""It made him a pioneer,"" Jeremy said. Reems followed up in 1973 with ""Devil in Miss Jones,"" another rare porn film remembered by many 40 years later. Reems' Internet Movie Database page lists 139 productions in which he acted between 1970 and 1986, when he left the industry. Although he aspired as a young man to be a mainstream actor, that goal evaded him in the wake of his porn reputation. He was initially cast to play Coach Calhoun in ""Grease,"" the 1978 smash musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, but producers ultimately replaced him with Sid Caesar. Jeremy spoke fondly of his 1980s friendship with Reems, with memories of hanging out in Bernards, a bar off New York's Times Square that attracted both Broadway and porn actors. It was a hangout where the two men would pick up women and sometimes ""go to the bathroom to do a little smoochie."" ""We were on a bunch of sets side by side,"" Jeremy said. ""We did threesomes on set a couple of time."" ""We were both Jewish boys with a big mustaches,"" he said. ""We both loved doing dialogue in movies, more than just an 'uuuuhh!'"" Reems left the adult movie business in 1987 and moved to Utah, where ""somehow he found Jesus and decided to go Mormon,"" Jeremy said. ""He said he was glad to be far away from it,"" Jeremey said, referring to the porn industry. Reems' new career was real estate, which he initially sold using his birth name, Herbert Streicher. Eventually, though, he decided to use his famous name to sell real estate. ""Maybe he wasn't selling enough,"" Jeremy said. ""He used Harry Reems, and business was booming."" Jeremy said Reems' death was not a shock because he had known his health was deteriorating. Reems' friends plan a memorial on Saturday after a performance of a stage play that tells his infamous story -- ""Deep Throat Sex Scandal"" -- at the Zephyr Theatre in West Hollywood, California, Jeremy said.

"(CNN) -- It wasn't enough that jurors at the federal trial of James ""Whitey"" Bulger had to sort out sometimes graphic testimony from 72 witnesses and the 32 criminal counts against the reputed Boston mobster. They had to gauge the believability of unsavory criminals who had taken plea deals. ""You weren't sure what you could believe or what you couldn't believe,"" juror Janet Uhlar said Tuesday. Testimony revealing deep-seated corruption in the FBI and government during Bulger's heyday left Uhlar disgusted with a justice system she called ""tainted,"" even now. ""Almost every witness that came through for the prosecution, I just had this feeling like it's tainted. It's tainted,"" said Uhlar, a pediatric nurse and the author of several books on the American Revolution. She spoke to CNN in her first interview since the jury on Monday found Bulger guilty of 31 counts. The juror spoke succinctly when asked to describe her gut thoughts about some of the trial's key witnesses. Bulger hit man John Martorano: . ""Absolutely disgusting."" Bulger crime partner Stephen Flemmi: . ""I can't cuss on TV."" Mob enforcer Kevin Weeks: . ""Scary. Still scary. ..."" Disgraced FBI supervisor John Morris: . ""There's no words. There's no words, absolutely disgusting. I felt like a traitor."" Still, Uhlar and her 11 fellow jurors found Bulger guilty of extortion, money laundering, drug dealing and weapons possession. They found he was responsible for 11 of 19 murders under a wide-reaching racketeering charge. Bulger, who turns 84 in two weeks, faces a maximum sentence of up to life, plus 30 consecutive years in prison. Uhlar called Bulger an ""old, tired man"" and said she wasn't convinced he was a government informant, as prosecutors had alleged. Known as Juror Number 12, Uhlar told CNN the government ""enticed"" many Bulger associates to testify by giving them ""extremely outrageous deals."" ""When you think if Martorano killed 20 people in cold blood and basically got a slap on the hand in less than a year for each of those murders. I mean, for me, that was huge. That was huge."" Prosecuting attorney Fred Wyshak, in closing arguments, defended the government's plea deals with gangsters, three of whom together implicated Bulger in the 19 murders and various acts of extortion. ""The government didn't choose them, Bulger chose them,"" Wyshak said. ""The only thing worse than making a deal with (former hit man) John Martorano would have been not making a deal with John Martorano."" Wyshak said the government ""held its nose and made the deal."" James 'Whitey' Bulger: Fast Facts . Uhlar criticized Morris, who testified about leaking confidential information that led to the murders of Bulger crime associate Brian Halloran and Michael Donahue, an innocent truck driver caught in the crossfire. ""Morris walks away having been actually involved in two murders -- Halloran and Donahue -- and gets promotions and retires at a nice old age with a full pension,"" Uhlar said. Like it did with many key witnesses, the government cut a deal with Morris. In exchange for his testimony, Morris would not be charged as an accessory to murder and would get to keep his pension. In court, he apologized to Donahue's family for leaking information that eventually made its way to the reputed South Boston crime boss and cost Donahue his life. Bulger declined to take the stand in his defense, telling the judge, outside the jury's presence, that his trial was ""a sham"" and claiming he had been given immunity for his crimes by a corrupt prosecutor. Bulger never specified what he gave in exchange for that alleged immunity. The judge barred Bulger's defense team from bringing it up at trial, saying there is never any immunity for murder. Gangster justice: How mobsters met their fates . Uhlar said that aside from the testimony of Bulger's cronies, she and the other jurors could find no supporting evidence in several murders that they ruled ""not proved."" She said the jurors believed it was not Bulger, but his crime partner Flemmi, who killed Deborah Hussey and Debra Davis, both 26. ""Whether Bulger was present with Debbie Davis, that was something we couldn't agree on,"" said Uhlar. ""With Hussey, we also felt that Flemmi killed her. Now, was Bulger present or not? He had been involved and present at the other two murders in that same house, so it was hard to remove him from that. So yeah, but we felt pretty strongly that Flemmi was the one that killed the two women."" His defense lawyer said Bulger was ""very pleased"" by both the trial and its outcome. ""It was important to him that the government corruption be exposed, and important to him that people see first hand the deals that the government was able to make with certain people,"" attorney Jay Carney told reporters Monday. Prosecutors offered up extortion victim after extortion victim to show Bulger conspired to collect ""rent"" from operating criminals in South Boston. Uhlar said she is convinced Bulger was guilty. But she is still troubled by what she calls a ""free pass"" for those called by the prosecution in their pursuit of Bulger. ""It was just pretty sickening to sit there and hear some of the testimony and the corruption with government and that -- at one point, I think one of the prosecuting attorneys talking about money laundering. And they were explaining once the tainted money goes into anything, every bit of money that now comes from that is now tainted. And I felt that way about the trial itself in a very real sense."" Uhlar said she is haunted by the vivid descriptions of killing after killing. ""It's still with me,"" the juror said. ""It's hard to believe human beings can do this to other human beings. ... I told my sisters, I'm different, I'm never going to be the same. Really, I can't be the same after this."" WBZ: Another juror speaks about the deliberations .

"(CNN) -- As scores of people head to the National Mall this week commemorating 50 years since the March on Washington, some corners of the media are still featuring passionate debate over whether African-Americans have ignored ""a culture of violence"" in their midst. The finger pointing this time comes after the senseless killing of Australian baseball player and college student Christopher Lane, shot dead August 16 while jogging on a street in Duncan, Oklahoma. From the moment three teenagers were arrested in the crime -- first misidentified as three black youths, later found to be two African-Americans and one white guy -- some media outlets tried to draw comparisons to the killing last year of black teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman. But if Lane's death has anything in common with Martin's -- besides the sad fact that both killings seemed avoidable and were possibly committed by people of a different race from the victim's -- it's the sometimes sloppy reporting used to make points about race that deserve subtler, more precise treatment. Random killings spark laments, but reality shows long slide in crime . In the early days of reporting on Martin's death, Zimmerman was identified as white because police in Sanford, Florida, listed him that way on the incident report. Those early reports about a white man killing an unarmed black teen fit an easy black-and-white narrative about racial profiling in America, while the truth was that Zimmerman identified as Hispanic, but still could have profiled Martin. Similarly, CNN aired a report suggesting that Zimmerman might have used a racial slur to describe Martin during his 911 call to police just before the shooting. But later, CNN aired another story with a different audio analyst who disputed that conclusion, and no allegations of a racial slur on the call surfaced at his trial. LZ Granderson: Negligent parents, lawbreaking kids . This past week, Fox News Channel's ""Fox and Friends"" and The Daily Caller website both reported the three teens who killed Lane were black. The Daily Caller also published a photo featuring a different, dark-skinned black youth identified as Michael Jones, the white teenager police believe drove the car during the shooting. Both outlets also criticized President Obama and activists such as the Rev. Al Sharpton for not making an issue of Lane's death in the way they spoke on Martin's killing. The mistake with Jones' photo recalls a similar error made as some media outlets began publishing material reportedly discovered on Trayvon Martin's closed social media accounts, in an attempt to show he wasn't the innocent teen his family and supporters described. Both Twitchy.com and Business Insider published photos of a shirtless, young black man facing the camera and providing a middle finger salute with both hands, identifying him as Trayvon. That person was not the dead teen Trayvon Martin, but a different young black man. About a year later, Zimmerman's defense team released images taken from Martin's cellphone which did show him shirtless, making a similar gesture to the camera, but it's tough to know what that revealed other than a teen with a typical rebellious streak. Still, an unspoken argument seems to be wrapped up in these stories. It's the conflict over institutional prejudice and racism. In the Trayvon Martin case, police knew who killed the teen and resisted arresting him for 44 days. That fueled concerns that laws such as Florida's stand your ground legislation were making it easier to profile and kill African-Americans. That seems a long way from a presumed thrill killing in which suspects were arrested within days, saying they shot Lane because they were ""bored."" Teen arrested in beating death of WWII vet . Even news that one of the teens involved in Lane's murder posted anti-white statements on Twitter months ago seems a different point. But some media outlets, committed to the idea that American institutions such as the criminal justice system are mostly fair, have focused on more personal explanations for such tragedies, emphasizing the criminality of some black people in ways that evoke old stereotypes about people of color and crime. It seems obvious that real-life incidents rarely fit neat categories and the need to explain senseless deaths can lead to a lot of jumped-to conclusions. But if the Chris Lane and Trayvon Martin cases teach anything, it's that cherry-picking facts to fit a preconceived narrative can be a road to inaccuracy and unfairness. Here's hoping somebody is taking time to soak up the lesson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Deggans.","Eric Deggans: Lane, Martin killings being compared to make points about race .
Races of some in both cases were misreported, false images posted online .
Deggans: The errors fit into preconceived racial notions when real story is more complex .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- After weeks of mostly silence in his defense, convicted Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan had little more to say Tuesday in the capital sentencing phase of his court-martial, telling the jury panel three short words: ""The defense rests."" His brief remarks produced a momentary gasp in the courtroom. The 13-member panel that earlier convicted the defendant for premeditated murder will now return Wednesday morning, to decide whether the Army Medical Corps officer will live or die for his crimes. The November 5, 2009, killings on this sprawling U.S. Army base by a lone gunman left 13 people dead and 32 others wounded, some severely. Hasan, who serves as his own attorney, called no witnesses; nor did he offer any documentary evidence or explanation for why he should not die for his crimes. He also offered no explanation for his refusal to mount any defense in either the trial or sentencing phases. Judge Tara Osborn, an Army colonel, reluctantly granted his wishes, telling Hasan, ""You're the captain of your own ship."" Tuesday morning saw the last of 19 victims and family members of those wounded or killed giving heartbreaking testimony: emotional recollections of lost loved ones, as well as injuries -- physical and emotional -- suffered nearly four years ago. ""The shooting and his killing is not going to destroy my family,"" said Joleen Cahill, widow of Michael Cahill, the only civilian to die in the massacre. ""He is not going to win,"" she said firmly, referring to the defendant sitting just feet away. Hasan asked no questions of the prosecution witnesses, who spoke separately on the stand. None directly addressed Hasan at the defense table or bothered to look at him while they testified. Hasan himself stared intently at all the witnesses during testimony, occasionally wiping his nose. Three shooting victims, eight widows and widowers, six parents and an adult offspring were among those who fought tears to describe their physical and emotional suffering over the past two days. Prison or death for Hasan? It's up to the jury now . Cahill recalled going numb when she was told about the killings. ""A lot of that night was a blank."" Also testifying Tuesday was Jerri Krueger, mother of Sgt. Amy Krueger, who was 29 at the time of the incident. She recalled what her daughter said the day of the September 11 attacks: ""She said, 'Mom, I'm joining the Army.' I told her she couldn't fight bin Laden all by herself, and she said, 'Watch me.' "" Krueger and her best friend enlisted the next day, and she had aspired to be a clinical psychologist. ""When a parent loses a child,"" said Jerri Krueger, ""it creates an irreplaceable void. I live with that every day."" Hasan was convicted Friday of all 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the shooting rampage at a Fort Hood deployment processing center. The incident occurred about a month before Hasan was to deploy to Afghanistan. Wounded by two gunshots was Lt. Col. Randy Royer, a Reservist. ""I have mental issues; I take anxiety medication,"" he told the panel Tuesday. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, and dealing with crowds is especially tough. Visiting the local pharmacy, where chairs line the counter, reminds him of the setup at the center where the killings occurred. ""I don't do well with that,"" he said softly. Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . Prosecutors presented ""aggravating"" evidence to demonstrate why Hasan deserves lethal injection. The court-martial unexpectedly recessed mid-afternoon Monday, and Hasan's standby attorney John Galligan told CNN that ""health-related concerns promoted the delay."" From his wheelchair, the defendant, who was wounded by military police in the attacks and paralyzed, repeatedly asked the bench Monday to take brief breaks from the proceedings. Among the victims' family members testifying Tuesday was Philip Warman, who was so distraught about losing his wife -- 55-year-old Lt. Col Juanita Warman -- that he testified that friends had to take his guns away for his own safety. And he abused alcohol almost constantly until the following June. ""I was falling apart,"" he testified. ""It was like something was ripped from me."" Warman entered rehab and has not had a drink since. He earns Alcoholics Anonymous coins as reminders of his sobriety. He told the panel that he pushes the coins into the ground when he visits his wife's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.","NEW: ""The defense rests,"" Hasan tells the panel .

"(CNN) -- Marian McPartland, the famed jazz pianist and longtime host of NPR's ""Piano Jazz"" program, died Tuesday, her label confirmed. McPartland was 95 and died of natural causes at her Port Washington, New York, home, Concord Music Group said in a statement. McPartland had a career that spanned more than seven decades in music, first as a piano player in music halls in her native Great Britain during World War II and then in the jazz clubs of the United States. She's pictured in the classic 1958 Art Kane photograph of jazz musicians that became the basis of the documentary ""A Great Day in Harlem."" ""I've played jazz as long as I could hear any. And I heard plenty in England before I came over here to America,"" she told CNN in 2004. She also frequently lectured at universities and served as a jazz disc jockey for a New York radio station. But she's probably best known for her hosting of ""Piano Jazz,"" the NPR show that began in 1979. The show was as gracious and casual as McPartland's fluid playing. ""It's so easy to make it a conversation, and you don't know where it's going to lead,"" McPartland once told NPR. ""The whole thing is so improvised, you really don't know where it's going to go."" Her guests included a wide variety of musicians, including Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Willie Nelson, Bruce Hornsby and Elvis Costello. She earned a number of honors for the show, including a Peabody Award, the Gracie Allen Award from American Women in Radio and Television and a Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievement. ""Our culture has lost a national treasure, and jazz music will greatly miss one of its most ardent and beloved supporters,"" the Recording Academy, which awards the Grammys, said in a statement. She never stopped recording. Concord credits her with more than 50 albums since 1984. ""What a truly wonderful and amazing lady,"" John Burk, Concord's chief creative officer, said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon says it's ""ready to go"" if it gets orders to carry out a military strike in response to Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons against its own people. Most people know Syria's civil war has been raging for more than two years. But the situation is so complicated that it's hard for even the biggest news junkie to keep track. Now that Washington is seriously thinking about ordering limited missile strikes in one of the most volatile regions of the world, it's a good time to retrace events and remember how we got here. Here's a quick-read cheat sheet about the Syrian civil war. It's not intended to be an all-encompassing encyclopedia, but it will bring you up to date on what's really important about a scary situation in an already volatile part of the world. Who wants what after chemical weapons horror? 1. What did Syria look like before the conflict? Even before the uprising in Syria, things weren't peaceful there. Discontent simmered for decades. In 1982, President Hafez al-Assad clamped down on a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. In one attack, his iron fist left tens of thousands dead. When Hafez al-Assad died in 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad took over the presidency. He promised to build a more modern and democratic nation. But reforms didn't come fast enough for activists, who called for change and slammed Syria's government as an ""authoritarian, totalitarian and cliquish regime."" Sectarian and ethnic unrest shook Syria over the past decade, too. A Druze uprising flared in 2000, and a Kurdish rebellion erupted in 2004. 2. How did the civil war begin? It all started in February 2011 in the city of Daraa, when authorities arrested 15 schoolchildren for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school. The children didn't mince words with the message they painted: ""The people want to topple the regime."" Word spread that the children were allegedly mistreated while in custody. Outrage over their arrest grew, fueling protests. Security forces opened fire, activists say, killing at least four protesters. These four, activists say, were the first deaths in Syria's civil war. Within days, according to Human Rights Watch, protests grew into massive rallies made up of thousands. Their rallying cry: ""Daraa!"" the city whose children sparked a national movement. Iran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark 'disaster' 3. How did the unrest turn into a call for an end to al-Assad's rule? It didn't take long for al-Assad to criticize protesters in Daraa. In a March 2011 speech before lawmakers, he said ""conspirators"" started out there and wanted to spread unrest. His dismissive remarks, and the way lawmakers applauded afterward, only further fueled protests. ""That speech had a catastrophic impact,"" the International Crisis Group's Peter Harling said last year. ""People who wanted to support the regime at the time were shocked."" Two days later, weekly anti-government protests began across Syria. Calls for reforms soon escalated into calls for the removal of the entire al-Assad regime. Now, armed rebels have vowed to accept nothing less than al-Assad's ouster, while the Syrian government has labeled them terrorists and vowed not to back down. The United Nations estimates that the fighting has claimed more than 100,000 lives. 4. OK, but that all started more than two years ago. Why do some people think the United States needs to take action now? Talking about Syria last year, President Barack Obama said ""a red line for us is, we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized."" The implication was clear. If Syria uses chemical weapons in the civil war, the United States will have to do something. Now, the White House says it looks like Syria has used chemical weapons against its own people. So here we are. What will Obama do in response? Whatever it is, it's time to sit up and take notice, because this news story is moving to another level. What justifies intervening if Syria uses chemical weapons? 5. What makes chemical weapons a game changer? Some argue that conventional weapons like guns or bombs also have a massive human toll. They say chemical weapons shouldn't be a turning point for the world to act. But the White House maintains that they're a game-changer. ""The use of chemical weapons is contrary to the standards adopted by the vast majority of nations and international efforts since World War I to eliminate the use of such weapons. ... The use of these weapons on a mass scale and a threat of proliferation is a threat to our national interests and a concern to the entire world,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said this week. 6. Why didn't the United States just send a bunch of weapons to the opposition when it had the chance? In June, the United States said it would send the rebels small arms, ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons. But that was long after the unrest started. Why the delay? Some argue that sending weapons to a region of the world that also contains Islamic extremists is risky business. Many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al Qaeda sympathies, the same stripe of militants America has battled in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Syria rebels have promised U.S. and European officials that any military weaponry they get won't end up in extremists' hands. But that hasn't quelled criticism from some quarters that arming the rebels is a dangerous risk. Russian President Vladimir Putin has slammed the decision to arm the opposition. At an economic forum in June, he cautioned, ""Where will those weapons end up?"" 7. What's the deal with Russia? Why are they criticizing the U.S.? Putin has made it clear that Russia and the United States don't see eye to eye when it comes to Syria. Russia and Syria are longtime allies. For one, just take a look at their weapons deals. Between 2007 and 2010, Russian firms selling weapons to Syria made almost $5 billion. It would be costly for Russia to end that relationship, analyst Peter Fragiskatos said this year . ""Russia's leadership still sees much to lose economically and strategically from cutting Syria loose,"" Fragiskatos wrote. ""Russia sees Syria as another test case for the West's appetite for intervention and views the danger of U.S. involvement as a direct threat to its own interests."" There are other reasons to suspect that Russia will keep supporting Syria. Russia's only naval base in the Mediterranean is on the Syrian coast, and Putin is still upset about NATO's bombing in Libya two years ago that removed Russian ally Moammar Gadhafi from power. 'Red line' debate: Chemical weapons worse than attacks? 8. What's religion got to do with it? The al-Assad family is Alawite, a Shiite Muslim offshoot that's one of the minorities in a country that is nearly three-quarters Sunni. Al-Assad has filled key positions in his government with extended family members, and many of his supporters are Alawites and other minorities who fear what might happen if the Sunnis were to gain power. Because the Syrian regime is Alawite and the majority of the country is Sunni, there are concerns that Syria could spiral into even more violence. 9. What's the worst that could happen? In a worst-case scenario, experts say, the fighting could spill over and make trouble for Syria's neighbors, threatening stability in a part of the world that's already known to be volatile. Surrounding Syria are Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan, Israel and Turkey. The violence has been prompting war refugees to seek safety in some of these nations. In Turkey, there are ethnic tensions involving Kurds who live along its southern border with Syria. All of these countries have a lot of religious, cultural and historical issues between them that add countless layers of complexity to the crisis. And when an entire region of the world loses stability, that worries the international community as a whole. CNN's Nic Robertson, Thom Patterson, Joe Sterling, Barbara Starr, Chelsea J. Carter and Kyle Almond contributed to this report.","Unrest in Syria started after children were arrested for anti-government graffiti .

"(CNN) -- When the English Premier League season began, Liverpool wasn't thought to be one of the title contenders. The Reds might be changing the minds of a few after beating Manchester United, traditionally its fiercest rival, 1-0 at Anfield thanks to another goal from birthday boy Daniel Sturridge. Liverpool owns a perfect 3-0 record in the league -- its best start in nearly 20 years -- and has yet to concede. And this without still suspended forward Luis Suarez. ""I think we've been working hard as a team since the start of the season,"" Sturridge, who turned 24, told Sky Sports. ""In pre-season the manager emphasized that. ""It's about the team, not about individuals, and it's showing on the field the dedication we've put in on the training ground."" Sturridge reacted quickest to Daniel Agger's headed flick off a corner kick in the fourth minute Sunday and Liverpool was mostly comfortable thereafter. New keeper Simon Mignolet was indeed rarely tested despite United having most of the possession, with United striker Robin van Persie squandering his team's top chance in the dying minutes. ""It is a great win for our belief,"" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""Last season we drew too many of the big games and we lost both times to Manchester United."" The visitors' cause wasn't helped beforehand when Wayne Rooney was ruled out after suffering a head injury in training. He is set to miss England's upcoming World Cup qualifiers. Sturridge could be the man to fill the void in the starting lineup, already netting five times in all competitions, although he continues to carry a slight thigh injury. While Liverpool has started the campaign strong, Manchester United fell to one win, one loss and one draw under new manager David Moyes. ""I thought we played really well,"" Moyes was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""We had long periods of the game but couldn't score."" The slow start will likely increase Moyes' desire to land a new player or two ahead of Monday's transfer deadline in England. United has been quiet in the market in the off-season, thus far failing to lure midfielder Cesc Fabregas away from Barcelona. A bid for Everton pair Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini was also rejected. ""We will keep working for what's left of the window but I've got to say I was really happy with the performance here,"" Moyes said. ""Maybe in the next few hours we will get a chance to do something but we couldn't give you a heads-up on anything."" There was a minute's applause for legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on the eve of what would have been his 100th birthday and the atmosphere seemed to lift the home side. Agger beat United defender Rio Ferdinand to the ball on the corner and then Sturridge poked it into the net with his head. ""I just anticipated the header from Dan,"" said Sturridge. Unable to create much going forward, United's frustration grew and van Persie exchanged angry words with Steven Gerrard. Mignolet was comfortable in keeping out Nani's drive in the 77th minute and then van Persie shot wide -- with his right foot -- from a tight angle off Javier Hernandez's through ball in the 87th. Another hot striker . Sturridge isn't the only hot striker in the Premier League. Olivier Giroud matched him by scoring for the third straight time in the league and Arsenal blanked a Tottenham without Gareth Bale 1-0 at the Gunners' Emirates Stadium. Giroud, bought last year to help fill the void created by van Persie's move to United, converted Theo Walcott's low cross in the 23rd minute. Both keepers had to be sharp in an open North London derby but especially Tottenham's Hugo Lloris, who denied Walcott and Giroud. Tottenham poured forward in a frantic finish, though couldn't find an equalizer. Spurs and Arsenal now have identical records in the league at two wins and a loss. While Tottenham has made seven signings this summer in anticipation of Bale's probable transfer to Real Madrid, Arsenal has merely brought in two free transfers even with ample funds available. Manager Arsene Wenger, however, hinted it could be a busy Monday. ""Maybe we'll have a good surprise for you,"" he told Sky Sports. ""We're working very hard."" In the lone other game in the Premier League, Swansea recorded its first league win by downing still-winless West Bromwich Albion 2-0 away. French striker Nicolas Anelka returned for West Brom after taking time off due to the death of his agent.","Daniel Sturridge scores his fifth goal this season as Liverpool beats Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- With a star-studded client list that includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lindsay Lohan, Julia Roberts and Michelle Pfeiffer, Trelise Cooper is an internationally known fashion designer. Starting out with a boutique store in Auckland, New Zealand, during the mid-1980s, Cooper's ascent onto the fashion stage -- and the front covers of Vogue and Marie Claire -- is made more remarkable by the fact that she never received any formal training as either a designer or seamstress. Instead, Cooper relied on her self-confessed ""obsession"" for detail, as well as a natural eye for fashion. ""I was born a fashion designer"" she says, and soon after she set up shop, her clothes acquired a reputation for their bold use of pattern and intricate stitching. Cooper took up the ""Fusion Journey"" challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital. Although it's a city she had been to on business many times before, she says that she'd never allowed herself the time to study its traditional dress in earnest. See more Fusion Journeys . There she was tasked with creating a new fashion line that would combine her own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant, brightly colored traditions of Indian dress-making. In her own words, Cooper retraces the footsteps of her Fusion Journey. Trelise Cooper: I absolutely adore the historical aspect of clothing. My ranges are full of influences from 19th-century French, English, even American vintage styles. So it's no surprise I have always enjoyed combing through flea markets in small towns and finding rare antique gems to steal some inspiration. I'm also obsessed with detail, so when I find a Victorian gown or a 50s bridal slip that I like, then it's important for me to be able to emulate the exact stitching, embroidery or beading used at the time. In the West, unfortunately, most of our expert hand-stitching traditions have been lost -- the skills have not been passed on and the seamstress geniuses from the couture houses of Europe have not been replaced. That is why I'm often traveling to India. It's one of the very best places in the world to find that expertise still thriving. From one village to the next you find whole families, generations, that have their own specialties of stitch work. Honestly, I can give them any old historical piece that I've found and they will either take it away and recreate it almost perfectly, or they'll say ""hmmm ... I don't know this stitching, but I know a place nearby that does."" It's a fashion designer's dream! So in one sense, I've been fusing my clothes with Indian influences for a while. However, I think this was the first time I've traveled to India with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles: their own traditional dress with my more modern, western creations. I just love the color and the vibrancy that is India. New Delhi is exciting and chaotic and noisy and dusty and smoky and hot. Everything is so full of intense color and I realized that, on a subconscious level at least, I've been influenced by Indian style ... In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world? Read related: Dancing to the music of love in Buenos Aires . Walking through the streets, you see color combinations that you'd never imagine would work. I recall a beautiful woman wearing a sari in bright, radiant pink mixed with a lime green print. I mean, lime and pink! It sounds garish, but on her, with the quality of the dye and the way the colors had been combined it looked absolutely stunning. We made our way to a shop that I can only describe as a treasure trove of fabrics and other goodies. This was the place to find all the accessories, textiles, ribbons, bows, buttons, and beads that I could take back to my studio in Auckland to use as inspiration for the final creations. There were ideas there, old and new, that I'd never thought about. Already I could envisage opportunities to use all sorts of different laces and braids, detailed examples of hand stitching, with some other antique dresses we'd picked up from a local supplier. Much as I love them personally, I don't sell things like saris -- and I never would -- it's not a style that would appeal to the tastes of my particular customers. However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins. I worked on the new line for many months, and these are the elements I hope I managed to incorporate into them. I think they've added an opulence, a romance. But I'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it. The garment takes them on a journey, and so my journey with the garment has finished.","New Zealand fashion designer Trelise Cooper flew to New Delhi seeking new styles .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal raced to a record eighth French Open title Sunday with a straight sets 6-3 6-2 6-3 dismissal of fellow Spaniard David Ferrer in a final briefly interrupted by a protestor brandishing a lighted flare. Nadal was serving for the second set at 5-1 when a shirtless man with a white mask ran onto the Philippe Chatrier Court and came to within a few meters of Nadal. He was swiftly tackled by security staff -- Nadal shook the hand of one of them -- but when play continued red smoke was still billowing over the court. Perhaps shaken, Nadal dropped his service but quickly regained his composure to close out the set in the next game. Protesters aside, the weather looked the only other obstacle to another Nadal triumph at Roland Garros. Persistent drizzle was in evidence throughout the match, but the heavier rain held off long enough for the reigning champion to wrap up victory in two hours 16 minutes. It was his 12th grand slam title and particularly sweet after his prolonged eight-month absence from the game with a knee injury -- only returning to the ATP circuit in February. He also becomes the first man to win the same grand slam title eight times -- breaking out of a tie with Roger Federer and Pete Sampras, who have seven wins apiece at Wimbledon. Nadal's reputation as the ""King of Clay"" was further enhanced by his epic semifinal victory over No.1 Novak Djokovic, but his friend and long-time rival Ferrer was to prove stiff opposition despite the scoreline. The 31-year-old fourth seed briefly led in the first set after an early break, but Nadal was soon back on track and claimed two breaks of his own to take the advantage. The second set was more one-sided, Ferrer making his only gain against service after the protest. Clearly impatient to close out his victory, Nadal immediately broke at the start of the third, but in trying to press made mistakes to be broken back. He broke through again to take a 5-3 lead and duly served out comfortably for victory, falling back on to the clay in trademark fashion to celebrate after a whipped forehand winner on championship point. ""It's one of the most special ones,"" said an emotional Nadal. ""In the last year I have had some low moments but without my family I would not have done this. Without my physio I could not have done this. I never realized something like this could happen for me."" Ferrer, who was playing in his first grand slam final, conceded he had been up against an inspired opponent. ""I enjoyed the two weeks here. I congratulate Rafa, he's the best,"" he said. ""But I will try my best to have another chance to play in a final and win a grand slam. This tournament is very special to me."" Nadal was presented with his trophy by Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt, who had been sitting in the VIP Box with Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Watch: Seles turns novelist . Both had born close witness to the earlier court invasion, which appeared to be linked with a simultaneous incident on the nearby Suzanne Lenglen Court, where several protestors also lit flares and displayed banners opposed to France's same sex marriage legislation. Two people were also ushered from the main stadium court after holding up a signs opposing the measure, which was passed last month amid widespread opposition in France. It is 20 years since the infamous incident at a tournament in Hamburg when Monica Seles was stabbed in the back on court by Guenter Parche and did not return to tennis until 1995.

Two Americans, one South Korean and another foreigner whose nationality is yet to be established are among the dead, the owner of the hotel, David Fischer, said by phone. Authorities had initially suggested three Americans were believed to be among the dead. Fischer said the fire began around 2 a.m. local time on the ground floor of the Dryden Hotel, which is in a nightlife district of Olongapo City, the site of a former U.S. Naval base situated west of the Philippine capital, Manila. The flames destroyed seven bedrooms, as well as a set of offices, a communications center and a computer room, he added. The six victims were all killed by smoke inhalation, according to Fischer, five of them in their rooms and one in the process of trying to escape. Investigators are still looking into the cause of the blaze, but Fischer said initial signs suggested it may have been an electrical fire. Police are trying to identify the victims' remains, as their identification documents were burned in the fire, said a local fire investigator, Jose Borlagdatan.

"London (CNN) -- It's easy to ask why Microsoft would want to buy Nokia when its share of the smartphone handset market is sliding. What can Microsoft possibly do to reverse Nokia's fading fortunes? The emails from analysts pouring into my inbox are evenly split -- great idea or a disaster; relatively cheap bet by Microsoft (at $7 billion) or a share price-eroding move. Read more: Why deal is good for both . So, can Microsoft leverage its monopoly selling software and services contracts to corporations, and get a slice of the employees' mobile business? Or, by getting a product which it is already in partnership with, is Microsoft simply buying the cow when it's already getting the milk? Watch more: Microsoft's deal with Nokia . The deal comes as no surprise. When Stephen Elop left Microsoft more than two years ago to become Nokia's first non-Finnish CEO, it seemed logical the two companies would eventually meld. One question rightly being asked, is whether rival handset makers or operators will simply stop making phones with Microsoft's mobile operating system. In my view, it doesn't matter. Nokia and Microsoft joined ranks two years ago and the others were a fraction of Microsoft's fraction of the mobile operating market. Read more: Is one mobile enough? The question in my mind, is whether Microsoft can take its mobile operating system and make it a player in the burgeoning market of cheap smartphones. Nokia still makes more handsets than any other manufacturer, and now that's Microsoft's business. Nokia's market share was 23.4% in the last quarter of 2012, according to research firm Gartner. That's because Nokia sells an enormous number of cheaper mobiles in emerging markets. Microsoft's task, then, is to stuff a cheaper version of its smartphone OS into these more affordable phones. The sales channel is there. The brand name of Nokia is known the world over. Microsoft is an expert at sales and marketing. The bigger task may be to integrate more than 30,000 employees into the Microsoft ecosystem. Many companies gamble that a bolt-on acquisition is the sure-fire solution to a missing piece of the puzzle. But it can set a company up to fail. A real competitor to Google-Android and the Apple iPhone could be around the corner. But it will be a huge task for Steve Ballmer's successor.","What does Microsoft see in Nokia, a business whose share of the smartphone handset market is sliding?

"(CNN) -- With its purchase of Nokia's mobile phone business, Microsoft has brought a longtime partner into the fold to help fight a battle that has been tough for both companies. Microsoft, which was late to the smartphone game with its Windows mobile operating system, badly trails Android and Apple's iOS. And while Nokia is still a force selling feature phones worldwide, it's barely made a dent in the smartphone market. But if the Finnish company is struggling today, it can still take pride in its history at the forefront of the mobile movement. Here are five ways the once-dominant phonemaker has helped shape the world of mobile electronics as we know it today: . First to move . It's not the sort of thing that smartphone owners today probably remember -- if they're even old enough. But the Nokia 1011, released in 1992, was the first commercially available mobile phone that operated on what's called the GSM network. The letters stand for Global System for Mobile. And what that meant was that unlike earlier phones, the Nokia could be used to make a phone call from almost anywhere in the world. GSM is still the world's most widely used mobile system, although 4G is expected eventually to replace it. Phone as fashion statement . A phone is just a phone, right? Of course not. Today, there are plenty of folks who, admit it or not, wrap at least a small part of their identity up in what kind of phone is in their pocket. That was a pretty alien concept up until the early 2000s when, if you owned a cell phone, there was a pretty good chance it was a Nokia. Remember those chunky, rounded models with the tiny gray screens and the nubby antennas? The Nokia 5110 was one of the most popular. And it also was one of the market's first phones that had a replaceable face plate. The plates came in a wide variety of colors, offering one of the first chances to personalize your phone's look. The 'slider' The popularity of early Nokia phones meant the company's designs often became the standard for cell phones. It didn't create the first flip phone (that honor belongs to Motorola), but the ""slider"" was all Nokia. The first was the company's 8110 model, which debuted in 1998. How cutting edge was the design at the time? It was the phone of choice in the futuristic 1999 sci-fi film ""The Matrix."" Mobile gaming . Remember ""Snake""? It seems laughably simple compared with the range of gaming possible on today's smartphones. But plenty got addicted to this game. Even though it had already been in arcades, Nokia began preloading ""Snake"" on its phones in 1998. Don't hit your own tail. Don't hit the walls. And what the heck were those things you were eating, anyway? Who knows -- but ""Angry Birds,"" ""Candy Crush"" and their app-store brethren owe a tip of the digital cap to Nokia's vision of telephone-as-gaming-device. Windows warrior . Phones running the Windows operating system haven't exactly set the marketplace on fire. In the second quarter of this year, 7.4 million phones running Windows were sold, according to Gartner Research. That's a long way behind the No. 2 system, Apple's iOS, with 31.9 million phones sold in that time. But Nokia has squarely positioned itself as the leading vendor of those Windows phones, making 82% of the devices sold last year. In 2011, Windows and Nokia announced a partnership in which Nokia switched to the Windows OS as the default system running all of its handsets. That hasn't been enough to put Nokia on super-solid ground, at least not yet. But the longstanding partnership is what led to Monday's purchase, and if having in-house hardware gives Windows Phone a boost, Microsoft and Nokia will reap the rewards.","Microsoft announced it is buying Nokia's mobile phone division .

"(CNN) -- During a summer when temperatures flirt with never-before-seen highs, millions of Americans are streaming to water parks. Not just in sunny Florida -- but stretching from Long Island, New York, to Wisconsin, to Colorado, to Texas and California -- sprawling facilities offer a wonderful oasis from this year's blistering heat. As they've grown in numbers and size over the decades, water parks have become more than just tourist attractions. Some areas, like Federal Hills, Colorado, own them and embrace them as social anchors of the community. In traditional vacation spots like Orlando, Florida, water amusement facilities have become adventure destinations that families find themselves returning to again and again. Water parks have become ""kind of the modern day equivalent of the pleasure beaches that were popular back at the turn of the 20th century,"" said Martin Palicki, editor-in-chief of the trade publication inPark Magazine. In this case, a shoreline isn't required -- just free-flowing H2O and plenty of thrills. Related story: World's best water parks . The most popular parks tout giant high-speed ""bowl rides,"" where brightly colored rafts filled with aquanauts plunge from perches several stories high into huge bowl-shaped tubs where riders learn the true power of centrifugal force. Other trends include water coaster rides that somehow force man-made rivers to flow uphill on tracks that twist and turn. It's not all about excitement, though. Many of these parks still honor the lazy, carefree tradition of floating down a slow-moving stream in an inflated inner tube. Parents and small children can stay cool and soaking wet at interactive water playgrounds. No matter how you like to cool off, seeking shelter from the heat has never been more fun. Because water parks tend to add rides each year, fans can expect thrills to keep on flowing.","America's water parks offer thrills from New York to Florida to California .

"London (CNN) -- It's the deal that's been rumored since Stephen Elop joined Nokia from Microsoft three years ago, and now it's become reality. Microsoft is to buy Nokia, and become a phone manufacturer ... for the second time. That's right, Nokia isn't the first phone company to be bought by Microsoft. It bought Danger in 2008, which it then used to launch the Microsoft Kin phone. That effort lasted around nine months before the whole adventure got canned and the world moved on. This time around promises to be different. Nokia, which was the number one seller of mobile phones globally in 2007, had a tough few years before the stewardship of Elop slowly started to turn it around. Watch more: Microsoft to buy Nokia's phone business . The Lumia range, which now includes half-a-dozen handsets, is still a minnow in the smartphone world in terms of market share, but it is slowly gaining traction. More and more people are going Lumia. Since its rebirth, Nokia has over taken BlackBerry in around 34 markets, according to the company, and things are looking up following the success, in relative terms, of its latest batch of Lumia handsets. The race is far from won, but at least, unlike BlackBerry, it is heading in the right direction. The deal will likely benefit Microsoft in the same way creating and making smartphones has for Apple. The Cupertino-based company has for the past six years been able to make phones, market them, and sell them in its own stores. As retailers throughout the last century can show (Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's and Dixons in the UK,) if you make and sell your own products, the margins can be higher, and the profits better. As the world's austerity drive continues, every little bit helps, and Microsoft will be able to reap those rewards even more once it owns Nokia outright. So what next for both parties? Well not much is likely to change in the short term, but Nokia will more than likely move into the tablet arena a lot quicker. Likewise, Microsoft's Surface tablet is likely to be rebranded or ditched completely, in favor of something more Nokia-flavored. Microsoft will license the Nokia name for the next 10 years. Then there is the former Nokia CEO, Elop. Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer has announced that he'll be stepping down over the next year, and Elop will surely have his sights firmly set on replacing him. Elop stepped down as Nokia's CEO on Monday to become the head of the company's devices and services business. He will continue leading Nokia's phones business as the devices chief at Microsoft. Whether you believe Nokia has done well or not, Elop has done a fantastic job at Nokia, and there's very little stopping him. Being a Microsoft employee will only help his cause. Perhaps Steve Ballmer wasn't such a bad CEO after all, especially considering that the $7.2 billion price tag for Nokia is less than the $8.5 billion it paid for Skype. This deal has just as much, if not more potential. But ultimately, by buying Nokia, Microsoft's ambition to become a hardware company is well and truly realized. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stuart Miles .","Nokia had a tough few years before Elop slowly started to turn it around, says Stuart Miles .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO and Afghan forces fought back Taliban attackers who launched an assault Monday on a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan. The insurgents detonated explosives and then began firing guns in an area where NATO supply trucks were parked in Nangarhar province, said Ahmed Zia Abdulzai, a spokesman for the province's governor. The initial attack was repulsed and Afghan and NATO troops engaged the militants in a firefight for about two hours, during which all the attackers were killed, Abdulzai said. No civilians or military personnel were killed, he said, and only a few NATO supply trucks caught fire during the violence. Firefighters are trying to put out the flames, he said. Taliban spokesman Zabiulah Mujahid claimed the attack, in which several suicide bombers participated, had killed soldiers at the base. But NATO said that no service members from its International Security Assistance Force had died. Situated at the border town of Torkham, the base is a transit point for the NATO supplies from Pakistan. The attack prompted authorities to close the border with Pakistan at Torkham and suspend traffic on the highway between Torkham and the Afghan city of Jalalabad. Militants in Afghanistan kill at least 12 . CNN's Khushbu Shah and journalist Zahir Shah Sherazi contributed to this report.","Taliban insurgents detonate explosives and fire guns in the assault .

"(CNN) -- Former basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in Pyongyang Tuesday on a five-day visit amid speculation he may try to negotiate the release of jailed U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae, China's Xinhua news agency reported. In Beijing, the gateway for flights to Pyongyang, Rodman told Reuters he was on another ""basketball diplomacy tour"" and would not be discussing the release of Bae. ""I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae,"" Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview before he left Beijing for Pyongyang. ""I've come out here to see my friend (Kim) -- and I want to talk about basketball,"" he added. Later pushing through a throng of journalists at Beijing airport, the 6 foot 7 inch (2.01 meter) former basketballer said: ""I'm just trying to go over there to meet my friend Kim, the Marshal. Try to start a basketball league over there, something like that."" In May: Rodman asks Kim Jong Un to let U.S. citizen go . However, he told the Huffington Post last week that he would likely broach the issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""I gave (Kim Jong-un) a great indication of when I'm going to Beijing soon -- that's just a hop, skip and a jump from North Korea. So basically, you know, I'm pretty sure I'll be talking to him soon,"" Rodman told the Huffington Post. Rodman is North Korean leader's 'friend for life' ""I will definitely ask for Kenneth Bae's release,"" he said. ""I will say, 'Marshal, why is this guy held hostage?' I could try and soften it up in that way."" ""If the Marshal says, 'Dennis, you know, do you want me to let him loose?' and then if I actually got him loose -- and I'm just saying this out the blue -- I'd be the most powerful guy in the world."" Rodman's trip -- which is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power -- is the second to the hardline Communist state this year. In March, Rodman was pictured with Kim, an ardent basketball fan, laughing and eating while watching an all-star basketball match. He was criticized over the trip which came at a time of escalating tension, with North Korea threatening missile strikes on the U.S., South Korea and Japan. Rodman has previously made no secret about his desire to help Bae. He once tweeted that he wanted the 30-year-old unchallenged leader of North Korea to ""do him a solid"" by freeing him. Bae was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in February after he was convicted of unspecified ""hostile acts"" against North Korea. The country's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the Korean-American was arrested late last year after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a northeastern port near the Chinese border. North Korea last week canceled a ""humanitarian mission"" by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues to Pyongyang, aimed at negotiating the release of Bae, citing annual military drills last week by the U.S. and South Korea.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's surprise decision to seek congressional approval for a strike in Syria was a gamble that will likely succeed and over time may be judged deft. But the way he got there has also raised troubling questions about his leadership in foreign affairs. History strongly favors congressional backing. Over the past two centuries, presidents have asked Congress to approve the use of force before a coordinated military engagement on 18 occasions. Every time, the answer has been at least a qualified yes. The current Congress, of course, is also one of the most partisan and rambunctious of the past century, so there is a risk they will turn him down. But in the end, a majority -- especially in the Senate -- are likely to follow the example of Sen. John McCain. Despite his disagreements with the proposed strike (a ""pinprick"" to him), the Arizona Republican has concluded that it would be catastrophic for the country to strip the president of his authority and prestige as commander in chief. That argument -- along with others about the risks of emboldening Syria and Iran, appearing to leave Israel exposed and failing to act in the face of such horrific crimes -- will surely carry weight. Tactically, the president's decision to seek approval got him out of a box. When the British Parliament on Thursday unexpectedly rejected military action, Obama was placed in a perilous position. He was almost a Lone Ranger in trying to punish the regime of Bashar al-Assad, with no U.N. support, a growing ""coalition of the unwilling"" (a nice phrase from Arianna Huffington), weak support in polls at home and a squalling Congress. By asking for approval, he might not only build a firmer foundation for a strike, but he has also regained a consistency with the view that he and his top team have been arguing since the invasion of Iraq a decade ago: that the road to U.S. military action should go through Capitol Hill. As a senator, Vice President Joe Biden even threatened impeachment against President George W. Bush if he struck Iran without congressional approval. For Obama, it is also possible that the delay for a congressional vote will one day be seen as tactically shrewd. Already, he is receiving more help internationally. Saudi Arabia has come out publicly for military action, the Arab League has toughened its stance and the NATO Secretary General has now called for punishment of the Assad regime for using chemical weapons. Obama's trip to the G-20 next week gives him a chance to round up more support. But there is no doubt that he and his team still have a lot of work to do to convince the skeptics, and nowhere is that more important than with the American public. Members of Congress know full well how uneasy many of their constituents are. They will soon be demanding that the president win over more of the public as a price for their own support. There is a good chance we will hear an address from the Oval Office on the eve of congressional voting. However this episode comes out, the president and his team -- despite flashes of tactical proficiency -- have been hurt by the uneven path they have taken to this point. At home and abroad, observers watch carefully and calibrate their own responses by whether they think the U.S. commander in chief and his team have a firm hand on the tiller. In this case, unfortunately, the overall leadership has looked shaky and hesitant. What is needed above all is a sound long-term strategy for the Middle East that is communicated to the world. Admittedly, that is very hard to do with the region in turmoil. But the world was also complicated and fluid after World War II and President Harry Truman and his team put together a strategy that worked for half a century and helped to win the Cold War. Truman turned out to be a celebrated leader. In retrospect, as Fareed Zakaria wrote this weekend on CNN in a stinging critique of the White House, it is clear that when Obama drew his ""red line"" a year ago against Syrian use of chemical weapons, he was making an off-the-cuff bluff with little thought behind it. That ""red line"" comment set off a chain of events that has made experts shake their heads. More recently, the surprise of Saturday's decision to consult Congress after weeks of beating the war drums has left many world leaders -- not least British Prime Minister David Cameron, who with the potential for a U.S. strike looming, tried and failed to win the British parliament's authorization to support it-- feeling whiplash. For the sake of the country as well as a just, stable Middle East, one hopes the president will succeed in bringing al-Assad and his thugs to account for their crimes against humanity. But it is surely important as well that he and his team emerge from this storm with a stronger grip on the journey ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen and Michael Zuckerman.","Gergen, Zuckerman: Obama asking Congress' OK on Syria, a gamble that will likely succeed .

Speculation has surrounded the England striker's future since the final part of last season, with former United manager Alex Ferguson suggesting Rooney had handed in a transfer request. ""Wayne is not for sale,"" Moyes, who signed a six-year contract to replace Ferguson in May, told reporters. ""He is a Manchester United player and will remain a Manchester United player. ""I see a glint in his eye. He looks happy, he looks like he will knuckle down and get himself right."" Moyes, who is United's first new manager in 27 years, has the unenviable task of following in the footsteps of Ferguson, who led United through the most successful era in the club's history. The recently-retired Scot guided United to 13 Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two European Champions League wins -- in 1999 and 2008. Former Celtic defender Moyes explained how the first he knew of his imminent career move was when Ferguson informed him he would be replacing him. ""I'm retiring, next week, you are the next Manchester United manager,"" Moyes explained he had been told by Ferguson. ""The blood drained from my face. I was really shocked but incredibly thrilled. ""It was incredible when I met him. Within half an hour, he was talking about the squad, players and the staff. I was sworn to secrecy."" Ferguson will remain at the club as a director and ambassador and Moyes dismissed suggestion his compatriot's presence could undermine the new regime. ""I hope Sir Alex Ferguson is sitting in the directors' box,"" said Moyes. ""He's been so good. I've already called him for advice a couple of times on a couple of matters."" Moyes has brought a raft of new coaches from Everton to United, but he has attempted to remain true to his new club's identity with two new appointments. Veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs, who has spent his entire professional career with United, has been given the position of player-coach after 23-year trophy-laden years with the club. Moyes has also appointed United academy graduate Phil Neville to his coaching staff, having worked with the former England international for eight years at Everton. Retired midfielder Paul Scholes was also approached, but the former playmaker declined the position. ""I spoke with Paul Scholes as well. He felt he wanted to have some time off with his family,"" explained Moyes. ""I felt the right person was Ryan Giggs and he has been great. He has been on his UEFA pro licence course -- a European coaching qualification -- and after two days you can see how incredible a footballer he is. Ryan is taking steps forward and to get him and Phil Neville together is great.""","Man Utd manager David Moyes says Wayne Rooney is not for sale .

"(CNN) -- The son of Suriname's president is facing drug charges in New York federal court. Panamanian authorities detained Dino Bouterse at Tocumen International Airport outside Panama City and handed him over to U.S. authorities, the Central American nation's foreign ministry said Friday. A federal grand jury indictment alleges that Bouterse, 40, ""caused a suitcase containing 10 kilograms of cocaine to be transported from Suriname into the Caribbean"" in July. Bouterse brandished an anti-tank weapon during the alleged trafficking operation, prosecutors said in a statement Friday. He faces weapons and drug trafficking conspiracy charges that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, prosecutors said. In a statement Friday, Suriname's foreign ministry acknowledged Bouterse's detention but said the reasons for it were unclear. He is the son of Desi Bouterse, a former military strongman who was elected president of the South American nation in 2010. CNN did not get an immediate response Saturday to messages left for an attorney believed to represent Bouterse.

"(EW.com) -- This fast and airy thriller about a team of four magicians is an engagingly preposterous high-wire act. It never stops moving (the camerawork, dialogue, and plot twists keep rushing at you), and it's exceedingly clever â€” at least when it bothers to make sense, which is about two-thirds of the time. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg as an arrogant card sharp, Woody Harrelson as a mentalist who can divine anyone's secrets, Isla Fisher as a lady-vixen David Copperfield, and Dave Franco as a wizardly thief. A mysterious leader brings the four of them together to do a high-powered Las Vegas act that climaxes in amazing on-stage bank thefts. Which is why a testy FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) is soon on their trail. The agent gets teamed with a French Interpol officer (MÃ©lanie Laurent) he can't stop flirtatiously fighting with, but his real battle is with the demon-prank illusionists whose every move is destined to outwit him. At times, ""Now You See Me"" suggests Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" made with a throwaway wink. The actors, including Morgan Freeman as an anti-showman devoted to revealing the magicians' secrets, look like they're having so much fun that you can forgive the periodic arbitrariness of it all.

"(CNN) -- If Roger Moukarzel's camera could talk, it would have some colorful stories to tell. From the front line of the Lebanese wars, to the bewitching fashion houses of Italy and France, the Beirut-born photographer has crossed every continent in search of the perfect picture. Born in 1962, Moukarzel says his calling was thrust upon him as a teenager, when civil war broke loose on his doorstep and he felt a duty to document it. For 15 years he worked for news agencies Sygma and Reuters, capturing the spectacle and chaos of combat. Swapping the battlefield for haute couture, Moukarzel's fashion shots have featured on the cover of Elle magazine, while his advertising work has earned him three Pikasso d'Or Billboard Advertising awards over the past decade. On his latest journey, Moukarzel swapped the baking streets of his home in Beirut for the glacial forests of Lulea in northern Sweden, more popularly known as the reindeer haven of Lapland. Here he would fuse his experience of both documentary and fashion photography to create a series of staged images that tell the story of how climate change is impacting the life and landscape of the Sami -- an indigenous people who live across four nations in northern Europe. See more Fusion Journeys . He was met in Lulea by local part-time photographer and full-time reindeer herder Carl-Johan Utsi, himself a member of the Sami. Utsi's knowledge and experience proved invaluable to Moukarzel as he attempted to tackle the rugged and frost-bitten landscape of Lulea. Here, CNN asks Moukarzel to look back over his Fusion Journey. CNN: Describe the photographs. What was the thought behind their composition? Roger Moukarzel: This series shows members of the indigenous Sami people from northern Scandinavia, dressed in their beautiful, very flamboyant traditional clothing. They are stood in the snow in this incredible landscape of Lulea, but right behind I placed an image of industry ... a big factory. Many of the people that are suffering the effects of climate change have not done anything to contribute to it, and areas that are being destroyed are often far away from where the pollution is made. The idea with the images is to bring these two realities closer together. CNN: What drew you to make this journey in the first place? RM: I believe that the role of the photographer is not only to take nice pictures, but to show people something that changes how they see and understand the world. There are lots of pictures out there of ice-caps melting, forests being chopped down and so on. They are very direct images. But I wanted to tell the story of an indirect process, a story that somehow shows the chain of events from factory pollution on one hand to habitat destruction on the other. This journey for me was about creating images that would have an impact -- that would ask the viewer to think about the cause and effect of climate change. CNN: Why Lulea? RM: The Samis are fighting everyday to preserve their traditions and culture. They mainly make their living from fishing and reindeer herding. The environment is really crucial for them and they are aiming to live in harmony with it. But in the past few years, these people have really experienced climate change. Their livelihood has been affected because they've not been able to travel on the frozen lakes. Why? Because they're no longer frozen! They are in crazy situation where they have to transport reindeer by truck because it is not safe for them on the ice. I was told that two years ago, a whole herd of reindeer died in the mountains because the ice beneath them just gave way. See also: Indian master chef gets fresh in Denmark . CNN: What were you first feelings encountering the landscape and the people? RM: It's interesting because for this project I had done a lot of research -- I felt like I had really immersed myself in the location before I got there, and that I would have a good idea of what to expect. But nothing prepares you for the reality -- the sudden impact of the scenery, the extreme cold, the deep beauty of this dreamlike land. It goes to show that nature is much deeper than what you can ever see in a photo ... this is something I always have difficulty accepting as a photographer! As for the people, they were wonderful. So warm, smiling -- despite all that is happening. They went out of their way to help me. CNN: You collaborated with local photographer Carl-Johan Utsi, did you work well together? RM: I could not have done it without him. As a fellow photographer, I think he understood my intentions much more, and as a Sami himself -- his knowledge and understanding of the people and the area was very important. From a technical point of view, his experience of shooting in extreme weather was very useful. It's not something I've ever done before and he showed me what to do when my camera froze, how to deal with the surroundings from a photographer's perspective. We had a lot of practical difficulties setting up the shoot, transporting the canvas and equipment across a very challenging landscape, and he was there for guidance at each step. CNN: Are you happy with the results? RM: Yes, very much so. I think there is a lot going on in these photos. You have elements of indigenous culture -- the colorful dress and these remarkable people; you have the striking, other-worldly landscape; and finally you have this shocking image that grabs your attention and gives the photograph its important meaning. But ultimately, the images are only truly valuable if they have some sort of impact. Already, I think, just by being on CNN, by you talking to me now, I can say that they are having this impact. From here I will be traveling to at least 12 other countries using the same idea, the same motif. I'm going to go to every continent to show the real impact that climate change is having ... So this was the start of my journey, and I hope you'll be there when I reach the end.","Lebanese photographer Roger Moukarzel travels to north Sweden to document climate change .

"(CNN) -- Lately I've been hearing wailing sounds in the distance from members of what's been dubbed Generation X over the prospect of beginning their collective sixth decade in two years. Their keening blends with that of their immediate predecessors, the baby boomers, who have for almost 20 years been grousing about their passage through and beyond their 50s. That's long enough to regret not only ""being over,"" but to regard even the notion of being over as being over. But what exactly is ""over"" when you're past 50? Unless you're, like, you know, dead. Blame it on the veneration of youth that media and marketers have been feeding us from the time boomers began their fearsome march across this blue planet after World War II. To be young was to be exalted, embraced, catered to and, to bemused elders, feared. Once you were past 50, you were no longer as important as you once were to people selling beer, fast food and clothing, which implied you were no longer as important to the culture, with relatively little to contribute or to inspire in others. But what's this? America's front pages now proclaim a 64-year-old woman as their newest hero? And she did what? Really? Yes, really. After four previous attempts, all curtailed by some combination of bad weather, hostile seas and sea life, Diana Nyad finally completed a record-setting, 100-plus-mile, nonstop swim from Cuba to Florida. She was the first swimmer to make such an epochal trip without the aid of a shark cage, reaching the shores of Key West roughly 53 hours after leaving Marina Hemingway off the coast of Havana. Two days and change seem like the proverbial drop in the ocean when compared with the 35 years, almost half her life, spent pursuing this grail. She had other things taking up her time: writing books, training athletes and breaking long-distance records. But the Cuba-to-Florida feat took its not-so-sweet time coming to pass. Even so, she didn't let age or time daunt or disqualify her. This was one bona fide baby boomer who was going to insist to all the subsequent generations that she, at least, wasn't over and done. As galvanic as Nyad's triumph has been to the world at large, even those who don't care a whit about athletic pursuits, it's been especially gratifying to those of us who belong to the baby boom generation and believe that we still have worthwhile, even astonishing things to contribute to the global imagination. (And in case there's any doubt about her boomer creds, Nyad sharpened her focus during her arduous journey by keeping the music of her generation front and center in her head -- mostly Beatles songs and, if I've heard radio reports correctly, ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"" from the 1960s TV sitcom ""The Beverly Hillbillies."") After Cuba-Florida feat, Nyad to swim 48 hours in New York . But Nyad is only confirming what those reaching middle age with more left to give have long been discovering. In fact, the past few weeks have brought comparably striking (though somber) reminders of how one's relevance can continue to ever more glowing terms past one's 20s and 40s. Between August 18 and 20, we lost three notable artists, Albert Murray, Elmore Leonard and Marian McPartland. Murray and McPartland, both of whom were vitally connected with jazz music and education, were in their 90s, while Leonard, who was writing best-selling, critically acclaimed crime fiction as recently as a year ago, was 89. As with Nyad, all three worked hard and made reputations for themselves up till their 40s and then outdid those accomplishments in the second stretch of their lives. The British-born McPartland first achieved cult status as a Manhattan nightclub pianist throughout the 1950s and 1960s, while Leonard spent most of those same decades writing Western novels and stories, some of which were made into Hollywood movies, including 1957's ""The Tall T"" and ""3:10 to Yuma."" Murray spent much of his 19-year Air Force career studying literature and writing fiction. He didn't start writing full time until he retired in 1962 at age 46 and in 1970 published his first book of essays, ""The Omni-Americans,"" when he was 54. For the next 30 years, Murray became one of the most influential of African-American novelists and men of letters, using an elegiac imagination, informed passion for jazz music and broad knowledge of 20th-century literature. Leonard's reputation likewise grew during the 1970s as a crime writer blessed with mordant wit and a keen ear for American speech at all social levels. But it wasn't until 1985 that he, at 60, became a semi-regular fixture on the best-seller lists with the publication of ""Glitz."" He would continue to amaze readers as diverse as Stephen King and Saul Bellow. In his 80s, Leonard achieved even greater renown working on the FX TV series ""Justified,"" based on his novels about a laconic, sure-shot U.S. marshal named Raylan Givens. Diana Nyad's jellyfish-proof face mask . McPartland's reputation in the jazz world may have been firmly established by the time her weekly ""Piano Jazz"" interview series premiered on NPR in June 1978 when she was 60. But it was through the show's years -- through 2011, when she finally stepped down as the host -- that McPartland revealed herself as an illuminating, charming and incisive guide through the mysteries of improvisation and seemed to grow artistically from her weekly encounters with musicians ranging from Dizzy Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan to Cecil Taylor and Steely Dan. So though one suspects Nyad's far from through in amazing the onlookers, add her to these recently departed as stirring exemplars of the second or even third wind. She's setting the pace for one generation -- and two years from now, the next generation of fiftysomethings should have sufficient reason to charge its own batteries for whatever wave comes by -- and wherever it takes them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: Generation X soon to join baby boomers in grousing about getting older .

"(Life.com) -- Saturday, June 1, marks Marilyn Monroe's 87th birthday. Or rather, it marks the 87th anniversary of her birth. It's difficult, after all, to envision what an 87th birthday might look and feel like for someone who died more than a half-century ago, when she was just 36 years old. Here, in a quiet tribute to Marilyn Monroe, LIFE.com presents a series of color pictures by Alfred Eisenstaedt, made at the movie star's Hollywood home almost exactly 60 years ago in the spring of 1953, when she was just 26. What's perhaps most striking about these photos, especially in light of all we now know about Marilyn's fraught and deeply sad life, is how relaxed, self-possessed and (dare we say it?) happy she looks.

"(CNN) -- Michiganders looking for work might want to keep their eyes peeled for Superman. Zack Snyder's upcoming ""Man of Steel"" sequel, which will star Brit actor Henry Cavill as Superman and Ben Affleck as Batman, is slated to film in metro Detroit and throughout Michigan, the Michigan Film Office announced Thursday. The Warner Bros. production has earned a $35 million incentive for the $131 million it's projected to rack up in in-state expenses. It's also expected that the upcoming release will hire just over 400 workers, and create the equivalent of 426 full-time jobs. (A bit of good news to follow a dreary summer -- in July, Detroit became America's largest city to declare bankruptcy.) In the eyes of director Snyder, Detroit ""is a great example of a quintessential American city, and I know it will make the perfect backdrop for our movie,"" he said in a statement. ""Detroit and the entire state of Michigan have been fantastic collaborators, and we are looking forward to working together on this film."" Snyder also helmed this summer's ""Man of Steel,"" which rebooted the Superman story and reimagined him as a hero who's capable of making devastating, controversial choices. The sequel, scheduled to premiere in July 2015, will put Clark Kent and the Caped Crusader on the big screen together for the first time. David S. Goyer, who wrote the first ""Man of Steel"" script, is also handling the sequel's screenplay. In addition to Cavill and Affleck -- much, by the way, to the Internet's chagrin -- the sequel will also star Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White and Diane Lane as Martha Kent. Snyder strongly hinted this summer that Batman and Superman will be rivals in this installment.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Claims of extortion and laughter-inducing testimony stemming from legal advice on e-mails highlighted Tuesday's proceedings in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial. Randy Phillips, the chief executive officer of AEG Live, disclosed that his lawyers advised company executives not to review old e-mails before testifying. That strategy could explain the high number of ""I don't recall"" answers by Paul Gongaware, the concert promoter's co-CEO, during his deposition and six days of testimony that have just concluded. Phillips, who followed Gongaware on the witness stand Tuesday afternoon, said he believed Jackson's mother and three children were trying to extort money from his company, which he insisted bears no liability in the pop icon's death in 2009. The Jacksons' lawsuit accuses the company of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's drug overdose death. AEG lawyers contend Jackson chose, paid and controlled Murray, who infused him with the surgical anesthetic propofol almost every night for a month to help the singer rest as he prepared for his comeback ""This Is It"" concerts. AEG exec: I didn't know Michael Jackson abused drugs . Jackson lawyer Brian Panish, who has been previously told by the judge not to argue with witnesses, quickly tangled with Phillips. ""Please don't argue with me because then I will argue back and get in trouble,"" Panish told Phillips at one point. ""Then that's an incentive for me,"" Phillips joked. The feisty chemistry between lawyer and witness promises to keep jurors, who often chuckle at Panish's courtroom behavior, on the edge of their seats for the next day or so. Gongaware's testimony was punctuated with so many ""I don't recall"" responses that jurors began laughing at one point. He frequently said he couldn't recall sending or reading key e-mails in the case, although his e-mail address was on them. Panish asked Gongaware whether he thought it would have been better for him if he had reviewed documents and e-mails before testifying. ""I relied on the advice of my attorney,"" he said. With his testimony concluded, Gongaware will resume his responsibilities as tour manager for the Rolling Stones. ""All this legal stuff, I don't understand it,"" he said. What killed Elvis? It's a question at Michael Jackson's death trial . Phillips, a law school dropout, seemed ready to rumble when he entered court after Gongaware. But he acknowledged that until two weeks ago, he had not looked at any of his old e-mails to refresh his memory. ""They felt it would be better if I went in without preparation,"" he said, referring to his lawyers. AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putman said outside of court that the volume of documents they would have needed to review was massive, making it impossible for them to prepare. E-mails that AEG Live executives sent and received in the months before Jackson's death include one in which Phillips assures show director Kenny Ortega that the company has ""checked out"" Murray and found him to be very successful. AEG Live executives later acknowledged they did not do a background check on Murray, who a police detective testified was in debt for more than $1 million dollars and faced foreclosure on his home. ""I wrote it in the e-mail that I thought at the time he had been checked out,"" Phillips testified Tuesday. He wrote that Murray was successful ""because that's what I was told,"" he said. ""In retrospect, it's not 100% true,"" Phillips said. ""There's what I thought at the time versus what I learned afterwards."" Phillips, Gongaware and other AEG Live executives ignored red flags that should have alerted them that Jackson's life was in danger, the Jackson lawsuit contends. Murray signed and faxed his $150,000-a-month contract back to AEG Live, but with Jackson's death the next day on June 25, 2009, Phillips didn't sign it. AEG lawyers argue that means it was not a fully executed agreement and Murray was never hired by them.

"(CNN) -- It was far from convincing but Manchester City beat Hull 2-0 in the English Premier League to bounce back from a defeat against another newly promoted side. Second-half substitute Alvaro Negredo netted the winner when he beat keeper Allan McGregor in the 65th minute and Yaya Toure made sure of the victory with a stunning free kick in the 90th. Although still early in the campaign, Manchester City was under pressure following a 3-2 loss at Cardiff City on Sunday after taking the lead. Had Hull converted any of its three good chances in the opening half Saturday, the result might have been different and more pressure would have been felt by new City boss Manuel Pellegrini. ""It was hard work,"" Pellegrini was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""Every match is going to be hard work. Hull defended very well. ""We know you have to give 100% to win every match but I think today that we were more concentrated in defense than"" against Cardiff. Manchester City, the champion two seasons ago and expected to contend for the title this campaign with Manchester United and Chelsea, improved to two wins and a loss. Chelsea has seven points through three games while United faces Liverpool on Sunday after registering a win and draw in its opening two fixtures. Hull slipped to a win and two losses but manager Steve Bruce must have felt his side deserved better at the Etihad Stadium. ""The way we played, against one of the best teams in Europe, gives us enormous confidence,"" Bruce was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""I think we have proved to a few people that we can play at this level."" Still without injured captain Vincent Kompany, City's defense looked shaky and Hull striker Sone Aluko should have done better when he was in alone on struggling keeper Joe Hart. He shot wide. Danny Graham had a goal disallowed for offside after a stunning cross from Robbie Brady and Robert Koren's low drive fizzed a yard wide. ""We cannot come here and have chances like we have had and not take one,"" said Bruce. McGregor, meanwhile, tipped over Joleon Lescott's header. Pellegrini brought on Negredo for Edin Dzeko to start the second and the move paid dividends when the Spanish international headed home Pablo Zabaleta's fine cross. City failed to add to the lead until Toure's effort. It was his second goal from a free kick this season following a strike versus Newcastle. Respite for Pardew . The Magpies scored their first league goal of the season to beat Fulham 1-0. Hatem Ben Arfa's late strike eased some of the pressure on relieved Newcastle boss Alan Pardew. ""You can't predict when you are going to score but what you can predict is your performance and in the second half we were terrific,"" Pardew was quoted as saying by the BBC. Cardiff followed up Sunday's victory by holding Everton 0-0, the Toffees' third consecutive draw. Newly promoted Crystal Palace won its first league game, beating slumping Sunderland 3-1, and Stoke recorded a rare away win, 1-0 at West Ham. Norwich blanked Southampton -- which isn't easy -- 1-0.","Manchester City scores two second-half goals to beat Hull in England's Premier League .

"(CNN) -- I've never liked the end of summer, with the days already growing shorter, with a handful of trees (in Vermont, where I live) beginning to turn red, with my stomach fluttering as I begin to think about the busyness and complications of the fall. Ever since I was a little boy, I've thought to myself: Can't it stay summer forever? So what is it, exactly, that seems so wonderful about summer, and makes us so terribly regret its passing? In a climate where four seasons are sharply distinct, it's mostly about the long and lazy days when you can get up early, sit under a tree with a mug of coffee to watch the sun rise, or wander into the garden in bare feet. It's about warm and green-leaved surroundings, and the aura of infinite time. This timelessness may be, of course, an illusion, but there's no doubt that the pressures of everyday life, in summer, seem less pressing. Even the night takes on a special quality in summer, with the crickets playing on their little musical instruments underneath the bedroom window as breezes push through the screens, offering a form of natural air conditioning. I've even noticed that in summer dreams seem especially vivid, as if the membrane between sleeping and waking were somehow permeable. It's not for nothing that we associate summer with childhood, as most children like nothing better than the last minute of the last day of the school year, when the bell rings and they are set free for two or three months, to run wild in the neighborhood, ride bikes, swim, play games. None of that boring stuff, such as reading and writing and arithmetic. Long after our lives are governed by school bells and academic calendars, there is still a feeling of relief when the cold and slantwise rains of spring stop, when we can sit on the steps outside and feel the sun on our faces. In June, the summer stretches before us, tantalizing, full of possibilities. We somehow believe it will continue forever as we walk beside dusty country roads, seeing the corn ""knee high at the Fourth of July."" But the corn grows tall, ripening as the days shorten. August arrives too soon, and time rushes to the brink of autumn -- what Robert Frost in his memorable poem called ""The Ovenbird"" refers to as that ""other fall we name the fall."" Is this the Fall of Man that he alludes to in this ominous way? Frost tells us that the bird frames for us the essential question that everyone faces at the end of summer: ""What to make of a diminished thing?"" Our summer garden, like Eden, can't stay put. It's impossible to sustain the idleness, the hopefulness, the sense of endless options that summer affords, however briefly. We begin to hear the waterfall in the distance as the stream quickens, gliding over the rocks. Too easily we imagine the dying leaves of autumn, the icy winds, a feeling that once again we have entered the stream of life in a big way. Responsibilities begin to weigh. On the other hand, we also like the fall, don't we? There's a quickening of life as we gather our wits and launch again into life, full tilt. The pleasures of autumn, even its melancholy overtones, have also attracted a fair share of poets. But summer is summer, and it's not easily replaced. As Labor Day arrives, with its last gasp of summery pleasures -- picnics and boat rides, family reunions, a table groaning with the best that gardens can offer -- I can't help but wish we were at the beginning, not the end, of this loveliest of seasons. I wish it were May, and that we could all join voices with the anonymous medieval English poet, who famously wrote: ""Summer is a-coming in! / Loud sing, cuckoo!"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","As Labor Day arrives Jay Parini can't help but wish summer weren't ending .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt rounded off the world championships Sunday by claiming his third gold in Moscow as he anchored Jamaica to victory in the men's 4x100m relay. The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds. The U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover. The 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix, not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles. The relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital. ""I'm proud of myself and I'll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible,"" Bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics. Victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade, while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems. Gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt. Earlier, Jamaica's women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who like Bolt was completing a triple. Their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of France, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds. Defending champions, the United States, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner, but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover. The British quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men's team. Fraser-Pryce, like Bolt aged 26, became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100-200 and the relay. In other final action on the last day of the championships, France's Teddy Tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump, exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold. Germany's Christina Obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women's javelin after five previous silvers, while Kenya's Asbel Kiprop easily won a tactical men's 1500m final. Kiprop's compatriot Eunice Jepkoech Sum was a surprise winner of the women's 800m. Bolt's final dash for golden glory brought the eight-day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium. There was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist Yelena Isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of Russia's new laws, which make ""the propagandizing of non-traditional sexual relations among minors"" a criminal offense. She later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, the next major sports event in Russia.","Usain Bolt wins third gold of world championship .

"(CNN) -- At the premiere of ""World War Z"" in London, star Brad Pitt and his fiancÃ©e, Angelina Jolie, were feeling ""great"" -- if not also a little emotional. Sunday's event marked Jolie's first public appearance since she revealed in May that she'd had a preventive double mastectomy this year, and the press wanted to know how she's been since her New York Times op-ed about her choice went viral. ""I feel great,"" Jolie told the BBC. ""I feel wonderful, and I'm very, very grateful for all the support. It's meant a lot to me."" Brad Pitt opens up on Jolie's choice . The 37-year-old actress previously said she decided to have the double mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery after learning she carries a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Jolie's mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died from ovarian cancer in 2007. Part of the response to Jolie's story has been an ongoing discussion about women's health, something that ""means the world"" to the actress. ""After losing my mom to these issues, I'm very grateful for it,"" she told the BBC. ""I've been very moved by support of the people."" So, too, has Pitt. The 49-year-old, who's raising a family of six with Jolie, said that her decision still makes him ""a little emotional."" ""Because of the act itself, what she did for our family, and then telling her story to others,"" he told the BBC, ""what it means to others has really surprised me. She's a very special woman."" Pitt and Jolie, who strolled the red carpet in a black Saint Laurent gown, also brought their sons Maddox, 11, and Pax, 9, to check out their dad's new zombie action film.

"(CNN) -- Barbara Walters getting very personal with Monica Lewinsky. Steve Kroft squaring off against Bill and Hillary Clinton during a pivotal 1992 campaign interview. Lance Armstrong going to confession with Oprah Winfrey. All were ""big get"" interviews in what's become TV-speak for marquee encounters. But while various outlets now vie for the first post-""twerking"" sitdown with Miley Cyrus, let's not forget that the biggest get of them all is still the exclusive property of David Frost, who died Saturday. His series of May 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon, revisited in the acclaimed 2008 feature film ""Frost/Nixon,"" remains the Mount Everest of all such face-offs. The interviews also built a major bridge -- since crossed many times -- between the worlds of showbiz and traditional ""hard news."" Against all odds and in the face of unyielding skepticism from ""real journalists,"" the man who once hosted ""Let's Twist on the Riviera"" went toe-to-toe with Nixon in his first interviews after resigning the presidency on August 9, 1974. In largely pre-cable times, and three years before the launch of CNN, Frost paid $600,000 for Nixon's time. That prompted the reigning ABC, CBS and NBC news divisions to reject Frost's advances rather than stoop to ""checkbook journalism."" He was left to cobble together a network of independent stations in the United States to broadcast the interviews, another precedent-shattering effort that far preceded Geraldo Rivera's 1986 syndicated ratings smash, ""The Mystery of Al Capone's Vaults."" Frost's four taped 90-minute interviews with Nixon, which aired weekly, began with a May 4, 1977, program devoted to Watergate. And the widely perceived ladies' man with the sugar-coated interview style came away with the ultimate trophy -- an apology after Nixon's earlier burst of defiance. ""I think unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life,"" Frost said, in search of an acknowledgment from Nixon that he had betrayed the public trust. ""I let the American people down, and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life,"" Nixon said -- after earlier leaving Frost open-mouthed with the assertion that ""When the president does it, that means it is not illegal."" News: David Frost, veteran British broadcaster, dies at 74 . I re-watched the ""Frost/Nixon"" movie Monday night, and was re-impressed by the performances of Michael Sheen and Frank Langella in the title roles. Although some dramatic license was taken, director Ron Howard pretty much crystallized the initial perception of Frost in an early exchange between Langella's Nixon and his agent, Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar (played by Toby Jones). ""Doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace,"" Lazar tells Nixon, who also hoped to use the interview to publicize the publication of his memoirs. ""It would,"" Nixon agrees. ""But it would have a lot less credibility."" But Lazar says they'd be paid a lot more by Frost. And so the deal was sealed. The late Wallace, then in his early years as ""60 Minutes'"" most famous bulldog, had an entertainment background himself as the host of several 1950s game shows. But he seemed to view Frost as an inferior during their at-times-combative ""60 Minutes"" interview. It aired shortly before Frost's first 90-minute program with Nixon. In an excerpt from their real-life exchange, Frost tells Wallace that he hoped for a ""cascade of candor"" from the former president. ""A cascade of candor from President Nixon? Is this what you expect?"" Wallace shoots back. ""No,"" says Frost. ""It was just a phrase that I thought would appeal to you."" Wallace later tells Frost point-blank that Nixon is ""hardly going to confess on the air anything about Watergate."" He has a book coming out, so ""why would he give it to you?"" Wallace's underlying implication is that he would have been able to pry a mea culpa out of Nixon, while an amateur showman such as Frost would be unequal to that task. But Frost holds his ground, telling Wallace that ""a lot more facts"" about Watergate are now known. And that Nixon ""realizes if he misses this opportunity, no one's going to buy the book anyway."" Frost and Nixon clashed on Watergate in the last of their taped sessions, although the Watergate segment ended up airing first. It drew a reported 45 million viewers, easily outdrawing rival programming on ABC, CBS and NBC. Frost went on to interview a succession of British prime ministers, in addition to former president George H.W. Bush and, in 1992, maverick presidential candidate Ross Perot for a PBS special. Perot proved to be perhaps even pricklier than Nixon, telling Frost, ""Everything you've just said is incorrect"" after his interviewer suggested he had problems ""dealing with equals."" Frost later told me his encounter with Perot was ""a very refreshing experience,"" although he would have to ""acclimatize himself to being challenged."" Post-Nixon and pre-Perot, Frost continued to mix and match, lending his name to political satire (""Spitting Image"" after his earlier mid-1960s tenure as host of NBC's ""That Was the Week That Was""); game shows (""David Frost Presents Ultra Quiz""); and entertainment specials (""The Spectacular World of Guinness Records""). But in the end he'll largely be remembered as a one-hit wonder who, 36 years ago, changed the face of television by doing it his way. He came, he saw, he conquered.

"West Liberty, Kentucky (CNN) -- Cleanup workers make plodding progress Monday in parts of Kentucky and Indiana where fresh snow complicated efforts to dig out of the destruction wrought by last week's deadly tornadoes. About three inches of snow fell overnight in West Liberty, Kentucky. One resident there, George Weddington, worked to repair the roof of a building next to a more than 100-year-old church that had its top torn off. He recalled what he did during the storm. ""I was really praying for us -- and I realized I was being selfish -- and I just started praying for everybody, you know. I don't know if that helped or not, but I did my best,"" he said. Roads were slick as crews worked to restore power in tornado-ravaged areas. A fresh blanket of snow also covered storm debris in Henryville, Indiana, where residents were just beginning to pick up the pieces after two tornadoes hit the town, including an EF-4 twister, with winds of up to 200 mph. Debris and downed power lines forced authorities to block roadways. Half of the town remained without power and gas, Indiana State Police Sgt. Gary Jessee said early Monday. The tornado outbreak began Friday and extended into the next day, affecting millions of people from Indiana to Georgia. At least 42 tornadoes swept across 10 states on Friday, the National Weather Service said. Alabama town struck twice in one year . By the time the powerful storm system faded, 40 were dead: 22 in Kentucky, 13 in Indiana, three in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Georgia. The tornadoes paralyzed a large part of eastern Kentucky, one of several states that requested Federal Emergency Management Agency teams to help conduct assessments. ""The damage I saw yesterday was the worst I've seen. ... It was a war zone, debris everywhere, buildings destroyed, other buildings just the walls standing, roofs gone. It was a terrible sight,"" Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear told reporters Sunday, describing his visit to the tornado-ravaged town of West Liberty. As the focus turned to caring for survivors whose lives were turned upside down by the storm, hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed, while good Samaritans donated what they could. ""When something like this happens, everybody wants to ... pull together, to help each other out. That's what it's all about,"" volunteer Victor Jett said. Bloomington, Indiana, resident Ron Stanhouse rushed to Henryville to help his college roommate after the storm. ""I had stopped and bought a generator and a chain saw and a bunch of gas and gloves, thinking maybe we were going to cut some trees and repair his house,"" Stanhouse told CNN's iReport, ""but there were no houses there."" Indiana State Police Sgt. Jerry Goodin said the destruction left authorities there with ""no idea how many people are left homeless."" In Henryville, about 20 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, the EF-4 tornado destroyed schools, homes and businesses, leaving many parts of the town unrecognizable, Kevin Welz told CNN's iReport. ""It is something you would expect to see in an end-of-the-world movie,"" he said. A toddler who had survived the storm in New Pekin, about 20 miles west of Henryville, died Sunday afternoon after family members took her off life support, Jefferson County Coroner Bob Jones said. Tiny symbol of tornado survival dies . The 14-month-old girl had been in critical condition, surrounded by extended family members at Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, said hospital spokesman Brian Rublein. Her immediate family -- including her parents, 2-year-old brother and 2-month-old sister -- all were killed. In addition to the dead, hospitals continued to treat scores suffering from major trauma to minor injuries related to sudden ferocious spurts of high winds, powerful hail and drenching rains. More than two dozen people were injured in Hamilton County, Tennessee, where tornadoes Friday destroyed 77 homes and damaged hundreds more, Emergency Services Director Tony Reavley said in a statement. Residents and officials across the tornado-damaged areas said they were committed to rebuilding their communities. Beshear said residents in West Liberty and other parts of his state were showing their resilience. ""It's going to be a long, long time to get that town back on its feet, but somehow or another I know they'll want to do it, I know they will do it, and we're going to help them do it,"" he said. CNN's Rob Marciano, Athena Jones, Dana Garrett, Chris Welch, Susan Candiotti, Jacqui Jeras, Daphne Sashin, Nicole Saidi and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: 40 were killed when tornadoes tore through five states .

"(CNN) -- On Labor Day, we celebrate the American worker. And more than four years since the Great Recession ended in June 2009, the unemployment rate is 7.4%, a big improvement from the high of 10% in the fall of 2009. Unfortunately, the rate is hugely misleading: Most of that improvement was for all the wrong reasons. Remember, jobless workers are not counted as being part of the labor force unless they are actively looking for work, and the decline in the unemployment rate since its peak has mostly been the result of workers dropping out of -- or not entering -- the labor force. According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, if the labor market were healthy, the labor force would number about 159.2 million. But the actual labor force numbers just 155.8 million. That means about 3.4 million ""missing workers"" are out there -- jobless people who would be in the labor force if job opportunities were strong. Given the weak labor market, they're not actively looking for work and so aren't counted. If those missing workers were actively looking, the unemployment rate would be 9.4%. We need 8.3 million jobs to get back to the prerecession unemployment rate, considering the 2 million jobs we are still down from the start of the Great Recession in December 2007 plus the 6.3 million jobs we should have added since just to keep up with normal growth in the potential labor force. Over the past three months, we've added 175,000 jobs a month. At this rate, it will take six years -- until the middle of 2019 -- to return to a healthy labor market. Federal contract workers deserve justice on pay . Our sustained high unemployment and weak job growth is also hurting wages: When workers have limited outside job opportunities, employers simply don't have to offer much in raises to get and keep the workers they need. The typical worker saw wages drop 2.6% between 2007 and 2012, and with unemployment expected to remain high, wages for most workers aren't expected to grow much -- if at all -- in the next few years. The reason we are having such a sluggish jobs recovery is not complicated -- there is simply not enough work to be done. Economists refer to this as weak aggregate demand. Another way to say this is that demand for goods and services hasn't picked up enough for businesses to ramp up hiring. The notion that today's high unemployment is caused by workers not having the right skills for the jobs that are available has been soundly debunked by economists. To solve the economy's key problem, weak aggregate demand, Washington needs to focus on policies that will stimulate demand. In the current economy, this means fiscal expansion, such as re-establishing the state and local public services that were cut in the Great Recession and its aftermath, and large-scale infrastructure investments. The priority has to be jobs, not deficit reduction. Filling the jobs gap is only the first step, given that weak wage growth for most workers predates the Great Recession. From 2002 to 2012, wages were flat or declined for a vast majority of workers, a lost decade for wages that comes on the heels of a generation of inadequate wage growth. For almost the entire period since the 1970s, wage growth for most workers has been weak. This means that in addition to the fiscal expansion in the short run to spur us to full employment, we need policies that will restore the bargaining power of low- and middle-wage workers. These policies include everything from aggressively increasing the minimum wage until it is equal to half the average worker's wage to updating labor law to keep up with increased employer aggressiveness in fighting unions so that willing workers can join a union. Also, the president needs to take executive action to ensure that federal dollars are never spent employing people in jobs with poverty-level wages. Broadly, it means making wages grow for not just the affluent but also low- and middle-income workers a key priority in economic policymaking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Heidi Shierholz.","Heidi Shierholz: Jobless rate improvement has been caused by all the wrong reasons .

"(CNN) -- After deliberating for nearly two hours, a Georgia jury found 18-year-old De'Marquise Elkins guilty Friday of multiple charges, including felony murder, for shooting and killing 13-month-old Antonio Santiago during a robbery. Elkins was also convicted of aggravated assault and other charges for shooting pastor Wilfredo Calix-Flores during a separate mugging 10 days before the baby was shot. His mother Karimah Elkins, who was tried along with her son, was convicted of tampering with evidence for her role in trying to cover up the shooting. Both Elkins and his mother showed no sign of any emotion as the verdict was read. They sat silently, staring straight ahead as they have throughout the entire trial. Elkins could be sentenced to life in prison for his convictions. He was spared from the death penalty, because he was 17 when the baby was shot. A Georgia law prohibits anyone who is under 18 years old at the time of involvement in a crime from being executed. Elikins' mother could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for her conviction. Sherry West, Santiago's mother, wept on the stand during the trial as she recounted how Elkins shot her son in broad daylight in Brunswick, Georgia, on March 21, after he and another teen tried to mug her. ""I told him I have a baby and I have expenses and I didn't have (money). He asked me if I wanted him to shoot my baby. I told him, 'Please don't shoot my baby.' He shot a warning shot into the ground,"" West said, weeping. ""I asked him, 'Why are you doing this? Please don't do this.' It felt like he shot me in the ear. Then he shot me in the leg. My left leg."" West said one of the teens then did the unthinkable -- he aimed for the baby. ""I tried to stop him. I put my arms over my baby but he still shot him,"" she said. ""He walked over and shot my baby."" During his closing argument Friday, Elkins' attorney Jonathan Lockwood attacked West's recollection of the shooting, saying she couldn't confidently identify Elkins as the shooter. He also accused her of plotting her baby's death to profit from a life insurance policy. ""Sherry West is a woman who was very distraught, who was very emotional. But also who acted in a rather bizarre way. You saw the video of where she is laughing and cutting up with officers, and making jokes with them just after her child was murdered,"" Lockwood said. ""Incidentally, does anybody know what the protocol is for how you are supposed to act when you watch your child get shot in the face,"" prosecutor Jackie Johnson said during her closing argument. Johnson called the defense's accusation that West planned her baby's death a ""grand conspiracy"" and an attempt to distract from the reality that his client is guilty. ""We have a defendant who preyed upon the weak. He preyed upon the weak when he was looking for Mexicans to rob, because he knows lots of times they can't speak English. They are afraid. They might be here illegally. They may not even report to police,"" said Johnson. ""They don't see any more Mexicans that morning. They see something even better, something even more weak, something even more vulnerable, a mother and a child."" Johnson ended her closing argument with an emotional plea to the jury to find Elkins guilty of murder. ""This case cries out for (determining) malice,"" Johnson said. The teenager accused of being Elkins' accomplice is Dominique Lang, who was 15 at the time of the shooting. Although Lang is a minor, CNN is identifying him because he is charged as an adult, and media outlets have been naming him since his arrest. Lang has also pleaded not guilty to the multiple charges against him, which include felony murder. He will go on trial later, separately from Elkins, and also faces life in prison. Lang testified against Elkins earlier in the trial, identifying him as the shooter.","Teen, 18, found guilty of shooting and killing a 13-month-old during a robbery .

"(CNN) -- The trial of Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, charged with murder in the death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, will begin in March 2014, his attorney Kenny Oldwage told CNN on Sunday. The first phase will take place in March, but the entire trial could take place at various times across a year or more due to potential motions and postponements along the way. Pistorius will be served with an indictment Monday following the completion of the investigation. It's the day that would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder over the February shooting death. The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his home. He says he mistook her for a home invader. The police investigation team ""is convinced that the accused has a charge to answer,"" a police statement said. The athlete's family said in June that he would resume running using his blade-shaped prosthetic legs.

"(CNN) -- An All Nippon Airways 787 Dreamliner was held in Tokyo after a mechanical problem, the fourth such incident for Dreamliners in 10 days. The plane was delayed Thursday after a cockpit message indicated a problem with the power supply to its air-conditioning system. More than 100 passengers who were supposed to fly to Frankfurt departed on a different plane eight hours after the scheduled departure time, ANA said. Earlier this week, a Denver-bound United Airlines Dreamliner was diverted back to Houston after a problem with its brake indicator. A week before, two United Dreamliners made unscheduled landings. A flight from Denver to Tokyo was diverted to Seattle because of an indicated problem with its oil filter. And a Houston-bound flight from London made an unscheduled landing at Newark's Liberty International Airport due to a ""low oil indication."" In each case, the plane landed without incident and with no passenger injuries, Boeing said. The incidents come six months after the Federal Aviation Administration and other officials grounded the Dreamliner worldwide due to troubles with its battery system. ""The 787 is a great airplane and we know it will continue to receive heightened attention when reliability events occur in service,"" Boeing spokesperson Yvonne Leach said Sunday. Additional Dreamliners . The 787 Dreamliner began service in the U.S. in 2012. The entire global fleet of 50 Dreamliners was grounded in January after two battery overheating incidents triggered concerns among safety officials. Among the Dreamliner's innovative designs is a battery system that uses new, lightweight lithium-ion batteries. In April, the FAA ordered all 787 operators to make specific modifications. United has been flying its fleet of six 787s since May 20. United is the sole U.S. operator of the airplane, which boasts high fuel efficiency due to the lightweight carbon-composite materials used in its wings and fuselage. In an apparent show of confidence in the new airliner, United announced Tuesday that it's ordering 20 additional Dreamliners, specifically the 787-10 model, a longer version of the plane. The plane represents a new generation of efficient wide-body, long-range aircraft, helping to make it among the world's most heavily scrutinized aircraft. Airlines worldwide have committed to buying the plane, and hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on Dreamliner's success. On June 14, Boeing rival Airbus flew a similar airliner, its highly anticipated A350 XWB, for the first time at its facility in Toulouse, France.","A Boeing Dreamliner is held in Tokyo after problem with power supply .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nothing says ""Wish you were here"" quite as well as the good old postcard. Is the electronic age throwing sand in the face of the traditional postcard? Tell CNN Business Traveller what you think in the Sound Off box below. Once a quintessential element in the travel experience, crafting a 10-line missive for the folks back home (saucy for the colleagues at work, respectful to the relatives) was as much a part of your two-week break as sunburn and sandals. However, thanks to the online revolution many of us are choosing to document our travels via the Internet. The growth of travel blogs and social networking sites like Facebook has led to a profusion of blogs packed with photos, video clips and every conceivable detail of our travels. The host Web site TravelBlog, for example, has over 80,000 members with 100 more joining each day. Meanwhile, the independent travel company STA Travel's travel blog has expanded to 60,000 blog entries in just three years. Celia Pronto, STA Travel's marketing director, says the appeal of blogs among travelers is due not only to their convenience but also because they allow the readers to join in the conversation. ""You can create this social environment with a blog that wasn't possible before,"" Pronto says. ""Friends and family can not only read diary entries but they can respond, and so become part of the story. ""It also allows travelers to reach a much wider audience than the simple postcard. It's a nice way to keep in touch."" So where does this online explosion leave the humble postcard? Well, the situation is not as dire as you might think. According to the Royal Mail, which runs Britain's postal service, many of us still retain a fond attachment to tradition, with postcards more popular today than they were five years ago. The service says it is processing around 135 million postcards every year, an increase of 30 million over just three years. This is good news for postcard aficionado Drene Brennan. The 80-year-old is the founder member of the Postcard Club of Great Britain, amassing a collection of 95,000 over 50 years before she sold most of it off a few years ago. She says the wonders of e-technology are no replacement for the simple pleasure of waking up to find a postcard on your doormat. ""I started collecting in 1957 and I've been hooked ever since,"" she says. ""Postcards are personal, they show you've been thinking about someone. You have to pick the right one, and then sit down and consider that person, what message you want to write to them."" Her views are shared by many CNN Business Traveller readers who wrote in in praise of the medium via our Sound Off box. ""The pictures are great, and it's a nice souvenir, plus you have something fun in the mail when you get home, besides all the bills that accumulated while you were away,"" commented Velvet in a post. Silvia added: ""E-mail is great but is effortless. When I get a postcard from a friend it makes me feel so special. They made the extra effort to pick out one just for me, physically write on it and send it off."" It's certainly true that postcards retain that personal touch missing from many blogs and group emails, which can sometimes feel like an exercise in self-indulgence with their reams of text and scores of pictures detailing the minutiae of Jeff's diving holiday in Ecuador. With the passing of time postcards have also become a part of our history, windows on a bygone world. Patented in the U.S. in the mid-nineteenth century, the first postcard was created for the world fair in Chicago in 1893. In Britain, it enjoyed its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s with the growth of seaside holiday resorts. ""Saucy"" postcards containing cartoon-style images with bawdy messages on them were hugely popular until Donald McGill, who designed many of the most famous ones, was charged with obscenity leading to many retailers cancelling orders. In spite of the Royal Mail figures Drene Brennan, whose own area of interest is Walt Disney postcards, fears the penned postcard may become consigned to the history books in the not too distant future. A CNN straw pole of tourists in central London seemed to confirm these suspicions, with most of those questioned preferring electronic media to keep in touch with loved-ones. And even for those who admitted to buying the occasional postcard, the effort of actually sending them was sometimes a bridge too far. Richard, a shopper on London's Oxford Street said: ""I bought two postcards in Sweden last week but I didn't actually send them. It's just the effort. I have to sit down, find a pen and post them and everything. ""In the end I came back and gave them as gifts.""

"(CNN) -- Sarah Murnaghan, the Philadelphia girl who underwent a lung transplant this month after a court battle, struggled after a breathing tube was removed Wednesday, so doctors ""sedated and re-intubated"" the girl, her mother said through a family representative. ""It's been an excruciating day. We extubated Sarah and her body could not handle the reduced support,"" Janet Ruddock Murnaghan said in a statement issued by a representative. ""It was impossibly painful watching her struggle to breath and panic. ""I have cried quite a bit, I just wish everything wasn't so ridiculously hard for her,"" the mother said. Doctors have assured the family ""that this does not change her long-term outcome but just means she needs more time to regain her strength,"" the mother said. ""One day Sarah will take that first glorious breath and we will celebrate!"" The 10-year-old girl remains on a ventilator and has been unable to talk, but she can nod and shake her head in response to questions, said Tracy Simon, a family spokeswoman, this week. Before her transplant surgery, Sarah, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, was put in a medically induced coma to allow her body to rest. Her family fought to allow children to compete with adults waiting for lungs based on sickness in a case that has sparked a public debate. She received new lungs on June 12 after a six-hour surgery that included resizing lungs from an adult. The parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. This month, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists. The girl has been in and out of hospitals her entire life, but her condition worsened this year. Her lungs had been deteriorating rapidly over the past few months -- much faster than anyone in her family expected. In May, doctors told her mother that Sarah had less than five weeks to live.","Sarah Murnaghan, 10, panics and struggles without breathing tube .

"(CNN) -- They can reach lengths of 18 feet and their numbers are estimated to be in the tens of thousands, but Burmese pythons, a nuisance in the Everglades, aren't easy to find. ""It's an amazing challenge to try to come out and hunt these big snakes,"" hunter Dennis Jordan told CNN Miami affiliate WSVN in the closing days of the 2013 Python Challenge sponsored by state officials. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Saturday that 68 Burmese pythons were killed during the January 12-February 10 competition that drew 1,600 registrants lured by prizes of up to $1,500. Though the take was small, wildlife officials said their main aim was heightening public awareness of the invasive species. ""Thanks to the determination of Python Challenge competitors, we are able to gather invaluable information that will help refine and focus combined efforts to control pythons in the Everglades,"" commission executive director Nick Wiley said. State wildlife officials say there may be as many as 100,000 Burmese pythons living in the vast swamps outside Miami. By comparison, the state is home to about 1.3 million alligators. ""You can go out there for days and days and days and not see one python,"" snake hunter Justin Matthews said last month. ""I don't care how much experience you have. It is going to take some luck."" Hunters covered a million acres of swamp and sawgrass, officials said. Scientists examine record python found in Florida . The pythons began turning up in the Everglades in 1979, most likely abandoned by pet owners when the snakes got too big to handle. They have no natural predators. Rabbits and foxes have disappeared, while raccoon, opossum and bobcat populations have dropped as much as 99%, researchers at Virginia Tech University, Davidson College and the U.S. Geological Survey reported in 2012. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has banned the importation of Burmese pythons, along with three other exotic snake species and their eggs. While the pythons can run to double-digit lengths, University of Florida wildlife ecologist Frank Mazzotti said the average snake runs about 6 to 9 feet. State officials recommended shooting the snakes in the head or decapitating them with a machete. Hunter Brian Barrows of Fort Myers won a $1,500 grand prize in the amateur category for harvesting six pythons, as did Ruben Ramirez of Miami, who bagged 18 of the creatures in the competition for professional hunters. Paul Shannon of Lehigh Acres won $1,000 for the longest python, which stretched 14 feet, 3 inches. CNN's Phil Gast and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","State announces snake hunt winners .

"(CNN) -- Nurburgring was confirmed Thursday as the venue for the 2013 German Grand Prix after reaching a deal with F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone. The famous circuit, nicknamed the ""Green Hell"", alternates hosting its home grand prix with Hockenheim, but financial problems left this year's staging in doubt. A statement on the official Nurburgring website said: ""the long period of uncertainty regarding the venue for the pinnacle of motor sport in Germany is over."" Thomas Schmidt, the managing director of the circuit, thanked Ecclestone for his support. ""With his commitment to the legendary circuit, he makes a significant and valuable contribution to the Nurburgring,"" he said. Ecclestone granted the hosting rights for this season rather than passing them over to Hockenheim to run the German Grand Prix for the second straight year. ""I appreciate the Nurburgring and its history very much,"" Ecclestone was quoted. ""Even today, this circuit makes the highest demands on drivers and teams."" Tickets for the event from July 5-7 will officially go on sale next Monday. Lewis Hamilton won the 2011 race for McLaren, but will return in 2013 driving for the German car maker Mercedes. Meanwhile, Red Bull principal Christian Horner has extended his deal with the team after leading them to double world title successes for the past three seasons. The 39-year-old Englishman has been at the helm since the team was launched by Austrian billionaire owner Dietrich Mateschitz in 2005. Horner enjoyed success as a young driver in junior levels of motor sport before forging his career in team ownership and management. The new ""multi-year"" contract for Horner was confirmed on the official F1 website Thursday. Red Bull has dominated F1 since 2010, with Germany's Sebastian Vettel claiming a hat-trick of world titles with the team taking the constructors' titles to back him up. Vettel and Mark Webber will again be the driver line-up for 2013, with their new RB9 car set to be unveiled at their headquarters in Milton Keynes in England Sunday. Vettel narrowly held off Fernando Alonso to win the 2012 title and the Spanish Ferrari star will be hoping his new machinery for the coming season gives him the opportunity to go one better. Ferrari will launch the F138 at their test track in Maranello, Italy Friday. It derives its name from a combination of the current years and the number of cylinders in its engine, the team said in advance. It will be the 59th car raced by Ferrari in F1 and Alonso will first test it at Barcelona on February 19. Before that, Felipe Massa and test driver Pedro de la Rosa will put it through its paces at Jerez. McLaren unveiled its new car, the Mercedes-powered MP4-2 Thursday, hoping they will start 2013 as they finished 2012 with victories in the United States and Brazil. ""It is exactly the same color scheme and I think it looks similar to last year, but it is completely different to last year under the skin,"" Jenson Button told AFP.

"(CNN) -- Marc Marquez continued his stunning debut season in motorcycling's elite class when he became the first MotoGP rookie to win five races with victory in Sunday's Czech Grand Prix. The 20-year-old notched his fourth successive triumph as he extended his world championship lead to 26 points with seven races remaining. He pegged back world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who had surged into the lead despite starting from fifth on the grid but had to settle for third behind Marquez's Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa. Marquez equaled Valentino Rossi's record of 10 podium placings in his rookie season, set back in 2000, and became the first rider since the Italian in 2008 to win four successive races. ""Before we came here I didn't expect win, because Jorge and Valentino had both tested at Brno recently and Dani is always so fast here and won the race last year,"" Marquez told the MotoGP website. ""It is a completely different track to those at which we have raced before, and these 25 points feel different to Indianapolis. ""This was a very hard-fought win and I enjoyed myself a lot. The battle with Jorge was really good and we are pleased with the victory."" Compatriot Pedrosa earned the 78th podium of his career, putting him equal fourth in the all-time standings with four-time world champion Eddie Lawson. ""I am very happy with the result, because after all the problems with my injury and the doubts we've had at the last few races, we took a big step forward with my mental preparation today,"" he said. Rossi tops that table with 145 podiums, but this time he had to settle for fourth -- the same result as his previous outing at Indianapolis. ""Today was better than Indy, especially because my gap to the front is half what it was there,"" the Yamaha rider said. ""The first three guys are impressive, very strong; I want to stay closer to them. ""Unfortunately I was 10 seconds back, another fourth place but I want to be closer, so we have to work."" His teammate Lorenzo was left third in the standings, 18 points behind Marquez. ""The championship is not lost yet but it's now getting very difficult. We need just a few tenths to win the race so we have to pray for that at Silverstone,"" the Spaniard said. ""I think I had my best start in all my career in MotoGP, I took four positions and in the first laps I was really quick. Eventually though I couldn't keep the same distance to second place so little by little they caught me. Especially under braking and on the straights they were faster than me so I couldn't do much more.""

"(CNN) -- As the forklift trucks packed up the motorhomes and emptied the garages at Interlagos in Brazil, it did not take very long for the inevitable question to be asked - just how good a driver is Sebastian Vettel? Sunday's race confirmed Vettel as just the ninth driver in the sport's 62-year history to win three world titles, joining greats Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher as the only racers to triumph in three consecutive seasons. However, what is telling -- given Vettel is still only 25 -- was the somewhat circumspect response from three world champions and former McLaren race-winner John Watson when asked to assess the Red Bull driver's talents and his place in history. ""It doesn't really change how many races you have already won, getting close to the championship is a big pressure,"" said Schumacher, the man Vettel describes as his childhood hero. ""Even if he appears to have a car that makes it possible for him, nevertheless he has to do it. He's going for it 200% and it's a very tough job. ""He managed to pull it out and that is the extra effort that comes from him and to do this so consistently is very special."" Rearguard action . This season Vettel had to hold his nerve much more than during his previous championship campaigns. In 2010, he had nothing to lose as he hunted down Alonso, who had a 15-point advantage, going into Abu Dhabi's finale. The following year he wrapped up a dominant season with four races to spare and finished 122 points clear of his nearest rival Jenson Button. This season, Vettel overcame a topsy-turvy start in which there were seven different winners in as many races. Twice his race unravelled with reliability issues and twice -- in Abu Dhabi and Brazil -- he had to hustle through the field from the back of the grid. The German only took the championship lead with four races to go and then had to fight a fierce rearguard action against Alonso. ""The interesting part is that this championship has been so hard-fought and it didn't really come together until the last races,"" said 1978 champion Mario Andretti. ""This season has been one of the best in memory. Vettel is one of the rare talents that doesn't come along very often."" Design genius . Talking of rare talents, the 2012 season demonstrated that if you want to get ahead in F1 make sure you have a good engineer in your team. No wonder Alonso pointedly half-joked that he was not only fighting Vettel -- he was also fighting Red Bull car design guru Adrian Newey. When asked if he agreed with Alonso, Newey's face broke into a slow, broad smile before he responded: ""No. What can I say?"" Crucially when Red Bull lost some ground at the start of 2012 because of a ban on exhaust-blown diffusers, Newey found a way to recover the car's performance and get Vettel to the front of the pack. There is no doubt that over the last three years Vettel has had the benefit of a supreme machine capable of squeezing out consistent pace and cornering speeds on a variety of circuits. ""Everyone that [wins the championship] hasn't done it alone,"" added Andretti, who dominated his championship-winning season thanks to the legendary Lotus 79 ground effect car. ""You can have the best driver in the world but you need the car. When Schumacher and Fangio were winning they had superior equipment as well. Vettel is making the most of the best design in F1. That's what it takes."" Peerless car . Three-time champion Niki Lauda certainly believes that when you're racing in a field thick with five other world champions having the best car is a useful weapon. ""Vettel is the top guy, [Lewis] Hamilton is the top guy, Alonso is the top guy, Schumacher is a top guy too,"" Lauda, who was champion in 1975, 1977 and 1984, told CNN. ""You need a car, and you need a driver. Vettel is for sure as good as Alonso is - but you need a better car."" What is open to debate is whether Red Bull's peerless car obscures Vettel's abilities behind the wheel or it hides his limitations. Some of Vettel's F1 rivals are said to be of the opinion that he does not deserve all the accolades he receives given the car he drives. Newey's response to that is: ""I certainly don't underrate him -- if other people do that's their problem."" And former McLaren GP winner John Watson argued: ""Vettel is a bright guy. Whatever the team provide him with he can capitalize upon. ""He understands what the car is designed to do and he can affect what it does on the circuit. For those reasons he is remarkable."" And anyway, Watson went on, Vettel is not the only three-time champion to benefit from superior equipment. ""Schumacher had five consecutive titles but that was in a period when Ferrari had influence on tyre development,"" explained Watson. ""Essentially telling the tyre company 'we want you to make tyres to suit our car and we don't give a sod about anybody else.'"" F1's dark periods . If Vettel's achievements over the last three seasons have aligned him with Fangio and Schumacher as the sport's only 'three-peat' champions, is it possible to judge these champions and their abilities side-by-side? ""You cannot compare 30 years back,"" reflected Lauda, who survived a near-fatal fiery crash at Germany's Nurburgring in 1976 before going on to win two more titles. ""These are different times and different people. ""The danger involved is the opposite of today. [In the past] every year at least one got killed so you could work out when it was your turn. ""To drive on the limit and win races is the same challenge, but today F1 is much safer."" Watson agreed: ""Fangio is my hero. Why I respect him is that he won five world championships in an era when motor racing was fundamentally a slaughter."" When Schumacher won his first world title with Benetton in 1994 it was also one of F1's darkest periods. The German won the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 where both Simtek racer Roland Ratzenberger and three-time world champion Ayrton Senna lost their lives. It remains as the last race where F1 drivers were killed. Safety improvements over the last 20 years means today's F1 drivers no longer roll the dice against their own mortality as frequently as the brave champions of the past. But Watson argues there is still an important lesson to be learned from Fangio, who raced to five championships in the 1950s. The Argentine won four of those titles with different teams -- Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes and Maserati. His feat has yet to matched. ""My definition of greatness is not winning three consecutive times but it is winning in different teams,"" said Watson. ""That is the judgement of a truly great driver. ""To move from team to team, to be able to build that team around you, to bring leadership and ability as Fangio did, that is why he is just the greatest all-time F1 driver."" As Christian Horner reeled off the names of other three-time world champions on Vettel's slow-down lap in Sao Paulo, Vettel revealed the Red Bull team boss had forgotten to mention Alain Prost. The Frenchman stands alone in the record books as the sport's only four-time champion. Vettel aims to join him next year -- then five-time winner Fangio and Schumacher's magnificent seven are all that are ahead of him in his quest for total greatness.","Sebastian Vettel won his third consecutive Formula One title on Sunday at Interlagos in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Changes to tires will make Formula 1 racing faster with more overtaking in 2013, according to the sport's official tire supplier Pirelli. Unveiled at the Italian company's headquarters in Milan on Thursday, the new look tires include softer compounds and new constructions which could lower lap times by up to 0.5 seconds, the company says. Pirelli say the objective of the changes to the ""P-Zero"" dry weather tires and the wet ""Cinturato"" range is ""to improve performance and increase thermal degradation, to ensure at least two pit stops per race and open up more strategic options for all the teams."" Paul Hembery, Pirelli's motorsport director said in a statement: ""The goal is to continuously set new challenges for the drivers and to ensure that all the teams start the new season on a level playing field when it comes to the tires."" ""Through accumulating more information with each grand prix last year, the teams eventually fully understood the tires, after a spectacular start with seven winners from the first seven races. The result at the end of the year was races with less competition and sometimes only one pit stop. This phenomenon was also observed in 2011, disappointing many fans ... "" he added. ""Our 2013 range of tires mixes up the cards once more to help overtaking and ensure two to three pit stops per race."" Color changes to the tire sidewalls have also been made with orange replacing silver to denote hard compound tires. Pirelli say the teams were given the chance to sample the new compounds during free practice in Brazil last November but the tires will make their official debut at Formula 1 testing in Jerez at the start of February. The first race of the new season gets underway in Melbourne, Australia on Sunday March 17.","Italian tire manufacturer unveils new tires for upcoming Formula 1 season .

"(CNN) -- Our experience in Iraq provides three essential lessons that should guide America's response to the Syrian regime's alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people. First, the president must present the American people and the international community with clear evidence that the al-Assad regime was responsible for the use of chemical weapons. The Bush administration took America to war in Iraq based on the false claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, including stockpiles of chemical weapons. Those false claims not only led us into a costly and unnecessary war, but did lasting damage to America's credibility. That erosion of credibility is haunting us now, as many in the international community question our claim that the al-Assad regime used chemical weapons. That makes it imperative that the Obama administration present clear and convincing evidence that the al-Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapons use. Second, if the Obama administration presents such evidence, it is essential that the United States and the international community take strong action to punish the regime and deter the future use of chemical weapons in Syria or elsewhere in the world. Again, the Iraq example is instructive. Many would like to forget the fact that the United States and the international community willfully ignored Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war and against Iraq's Kurdish population in 1988 in the aftermath of that war. I remember those days well. Together with Peter Galbraith, my former colleague on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I traveled to the Iraq-Turkey border in September 1988 to investigate Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons offensive against the Kurds. We returned to Washington to urge the United States government to impose economic sanctions against Iraq for its use of chemical weapons. While the United States Senate did pass such legislation, it was opposed by the Reagan administration and never made it out of the House of Representatives. Recently released CIA documents demonstrate that the Reagan administration deliberately ignored Iraq's use of chemical weapons because it favored Iraq in its war against Iran. But the failure of that sanctions legislation represented a failure of the United States to help enforce the international convention against the use of chemical weapons. A strong case can be made that the refusal of the United States and the international community to confront Saddam Hussein for his flagrant violations of the international ban on chemical weapons emboldened him to take additional reckless actions. In 1990, he miscalculated the international response to his invasion of Kuwait. Years later, even after he had destroyed his chemical weapons stockpile, he underestimated the depth of international concern that he was still hiding them. That is perhaps not surprising, considering that the international community did nothing when Saddam Hussein actually used chemical weapons in the 1980s. The United States and the international community must not again stand idly by if the al-Assad regime, or another party, has used chemical weapons. It must take action to uphold international norms and send a clear signal that breaches of the international ban on chemical weapons use will not be tolerated. Failure to act upon strong evidence will only encourage Bashar al-Assad and other international actors to use chemical weapons in the future. The third lesson from Iraq is equally important as the first two. Our mission must be clearly defined and achievable at an acceptable cost. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush established a well defined goal -- using force to oust Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. He deliberately chose not to send American troops to Baghdad to topple Saddam Hussein, because he rightfully determined that the United States would not be able to contain the violent fallout without a huge commitment of American lives and treasure. President George W. Bush later made the mistake that his father avoided. The Iraq war clearly established that even massive U.S. troop intervention on the ground for over eight years cannot change many of the basic cultural and sectarian forces at play in the region. Today, despite the huge sacrifice in American and Iraqi lives, Iraq is rocked by almost daily eruptions of sectarian violence. The American-backed, Shiite-dominated government of Iraq now allows Iranian planes to use its airspace to supply weapons to al-Assad and the minority Shiite Alawite sect that controls Syria. Meanwhile, al Qaeda and Sunni extremists in Iraq are fighting to defeat the government in Baghdad as al Qaeda and Sunni extremist forces in Syria are fighting in tandem with American-supported rebels to defeat the al-Assad regime. The toxic mix of forces suggests that even a large U.S. troop presence in Syria would be unlikely to change these deep-running currents. These lessons are important as President Obama defines the purpose of American military action in Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons. The president should make clear that the goal of our military action is to punish Syria for its blatantly illegal use of chemical weapons and to deter the future use of such weapons by the Syrian regime or others that might contemplate their use in future conflicts. Our action should be coupled with a clear statement that any future use of chemical weapons will be met with increasing force. This goal can be reasonably accomplished by using cruise missile strikes that inflict significant pain and damage on al-Assad's forces without putting American lives in the line of fire. Some have argued that it is pointless for the United States to engage in punitive military strikes against Syria unless our actions are designed to decisively tip the military balance toward the rebels. That claim downplays the more limited, but nevertheless important, objective of deterring the future use of chemical weapons. Moreover, defining the success of our response as decisively changing the military balance is unrealistic, unachievable without putting American lives at risk, and will ultimately drag the United States toward full-scale intervention in a Syrian civil war. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated that measures like the establishment of a no-fly zone would put American pilots at risk and may not change the situation on the ground. Measuring success of these actions in terms of changing the tide of the war will lead inexorably to further assertions that American credibility is at stake and suck America into a costly civil war that could, with the current configuration of forces, result in the extremist al Qaeda elements among the rebels gaining the upper hand. That is why it is so important to define this particular mission in a way that can be achieved at an acceptable cost. Let's heed three important lessons from Iraq: Protect our credibility by presenting clear evidence of the use of chemical weapons by the al-Assad regime; take strong action to punish the illegal use of chemical weapons and deter their future use; and define the mission in achievable terms at a cost we are willing to pay. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Van Hollen.","Rep. Chris van Hollen: Three lessons from Iraq can guide intervention in Syria .

"(CNN) -- People traveling early for Christmas in the center of the country will be dashing through the snow and the rain and the wind. The first major storm of the season has prompted the National Weather Service to issue a blizzard warning for a huge swath of the Midwest stretching from eastern Colorado to Wisconsin's Lake Michigan shoreline, including virtually all of Iowa. The declaration warns of snow accumulations of up to 12 inches, complemented by 25- to 35-mph winds that will occasionally gust to 45 to 50 mph. A 156-mile stretch of Interstate Highway 70 between Denver and the Kansas state line was closed in both directions for a time Wednesday. The westbound side reopened about 7 p.m. MT, but the eastbound lanes remained closed. Cheyenne Wells, in east-central Colorado, reported a 67-mph wind gust with zero visibility just after 2 p.m. MT, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. U.S. Highway 385 was closed for 65 miles in the Cheyenne Wells region, Colorado's Department of Transportation reported. ""Most of the storm is on its way out across the state, except for the Eastern Plains, where there are still high winds, blizzard conditions, and highway closures,"" the department's Facebook page said. ""Whiteout conditions are likely and travel could become impossible"" Wednesday night and into Thursday, the service's Omaha, Nebraska, office warned. Is the storm hitting you? Send images to iReport . ""Far southeast Nebraska and extreme southwest Iowa could see rain or a wintry mix for several hours yet this evening, so blizzard conditions may not develop over that area until mid-evening or later,"" the service said. Airlines were reporting relatively few cancellations or delays in areas affected by the storm Wednesday night, but that could change overnight. The storm will race into western Illinois, the weather service said. Rain will quickly change over to snow as the storm advances northeast, with the heaviest snow occurring overnight. ""Snow drifts several feet deep will be possible given the strong winds,"" the blizzard warning states. At least 17 people were sent to hospitals near Lubbock, Texas, after a 23-vehicle chain-reaction crash on Interstate Highway 27 north of New Deal, Texas, state safety officials told CNN. There was at least one fatality, said Clinton Thetford, emergency management coordinator of Lubbock County. A stretch of the freeway in Lubbock County remains closed indefinitely. Wrapping around the blizzard warning on the north, south and east is a winter storm warning, which will be no picnic either. The winds won't be quite as strong, but residents should expect a strong dose of rain, sleet and snow, with a few hail-packing thunderstorms thrown in for good measure. A winter weather advisory is in effect for the Indiana-Ohio-Michigan tri-state area, as well as central Missouri and Kansas. The ""intense cyclone"" will crawl across the Great Lakes region Thursday and slog into northern New England by Friday evening, the National Weather Service predicted. Dodging the heavy precipitation but not the high winds is an area from western Texas and eastern New Mexico through the Oklahoma Panhandle and into southwest Kansas. Much of the Southwest and Mississippi Valley is extremely dry, and the high winds have kicked up blinding dust near Lubbock, Texas. CNN's Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: 156-mile stretch of freeway closed in Colorado .

"London (CNN) -- The first race in Melbourne is just around the corner and Formula 1 teams are gearing up for a season which promises to be as technical as it is tactical. Cars converge in 2013 . With the sport's governing body, the FIA announcing minor changes to technical regulations, teams have mostly tweaked their cars in 2013, says F1 journalist Craig Scarborough. ""There are big rule changes coming up next year so the teams are trying to balance their resources. They don't need to completely go out and redesign their chassis, it's just a few little features that they want to incorporate. No one has produced a massively different or a massively exciting car this year,"" he said. Red Bull and Ferrari both spoke of ""evolution"" at their respective car launches with Red Bull's chief technical officer Adrian Newey saying the focus had been on the details of the new RB9. ""We've tidied up some bits we thought could be improved upon -- but as is usual these days, this is a car in transition,"" said Newey at the RB9's launch. Vettel revs up for glory . ""There will be one or two new parts appearing by the first race, which I'm sure is the same for everybody. After that it's going to be about development through the year,"" Newey added. Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn says the new F1 W04 is a ""clear step forward in design and detail sophistication over its predecessor,"" while Lotus have continued their design themes with the E21, according to technical chief James Allison. Hamilton crashes out in Jerez . ""Everyone seems to be converging on the same solutions,"" Scarborough says. ""You could almost get an identikit of a nose, a front suspension, a sidepod and a rear suspension and you could shuffle those parts around and pretty much come up with every car on the grid."" Swiss-based Sauber are perhaps an exception to the rule this year, unveiling a car with a new silver livery and noticeably slimmer sidepods. ""Rather than air being sucked into the radiators, the air is going straight over to the exhaust -- this benefits in terms of lower drag,"" explains Scarborough. ""Their car this year, as it was last year, is a bit of a tour de force in terms of good ideas and it's not surprising that Red Bull have copied two or three of their ideas on this year's car. ""Sauber might be seen as one of the teams that win the design race, but don't necessarily get the race-to-race results that that deserves."" 'Tsunami of regulatory change' As Scarborough says, imminent rule changes are looming in team's rear view mirrors. ""There is an absolute tsunami of regulatory change in 2014,"" says Lotus' Allison. ""The cars need to be reinvented from scratch."" The biggest change is the engine, says Scarborough, with a 1.6-liter V6 engine replacing the 2.4-liter V8. ""The engine is producing a lot less power, but what you will have is a far more powerful hybrid/KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) set-up."" ""You will have the conventional KERS -- which obviously charges under braking -- and you can also have a KERS device which attaches to the turbo charger, so when your off the power, you'll be generating energy through the turbo charger. It's called thermal energy recovery. ""This will give you more than double the power output -- (this year,) it's about 80 hp for 6.7 seconds, next year you will probably get 150 hp for about 30 seconds. ""There's lots of other stuff going on. All the stuff that bolts to the back of the car and all the cooling that requires will be completely different next year,"" Scarborough says. Raikkonen: 'Lotus can win F1 title' To ignore all these changes would mean being uncompetitive in 2014, says Allison. ""So, (the E21) needed to be developed while being squeezed on both sides from 2012 and 2014 -- that's a significant logistical challenge,"" Allison said. Will tire changes make for a gripping season? Pirelli's new tires are the most significant change this season, says Red Bull's Newey. According to the Italian-based company, the introduction of new softer compound tires will improve laps times and increase overtaking. ""After a spectacular start with seven winners from the first seven races, the result at the end of the year was races with less competition and sometimes only one pit stop. This phenomenon was also observed in 2011, disappointing many fans,"" Paul Hembery, Pirelli's motorsport director said when the tires were launched in January. ""Our 2013 range of tires mixes up the cards once more to help overtaking and ensure two to three pit stops per race,"" he added. Pirelli say that this year's hard compound tire (with new orange coloring on the tire sidewall) is ""roughly equivalent to last year's medium compound"" with the ""performance gap between the different compounds now in excess of 0.5 seconds per lap."" Softer compounds mean quicker tire wear, says Scarborough. ""There will be no one-stop races because the tires just won't last that long. Drivers will have to manage the tires. Strategy is going to be really critical this year in terms of teams thinking 'do we go for extra tire stops or eek out (the maximum from) a set of tires?"" he said. ""As we saw last year, if you try and run too long on a set of tires they drop off a cliff and lose all performance. That could happen quite quickly with some of the tires this year, particularly if we get a hot season."" The teams and drivers have been getting to grips with the new tires at pre-season testing in Jerez, Spain. ""With these tires, you're always on your toes,"" said Mark Webber and Jenson Button -- who topped the timesheets on the first day of testing -- and they talked of a ""different feeling"" compared to last year. ""I think it is a better tire. It will be tricky again in terms of laps and degradation, but Pirelli has done a great job getting a wider range for the tires. ""One thing that I have noticed -- you are able to go fast immediately, even on lap one. That is something that we couldn't do last year,"" Button told Formula1.com. Who will set the pace in 2013? So who will reign in 2013? Will Red Bull lead the way again? Can Ferrari claim a first constuctors' title in five years? Or will McLaren end a 15-year drought in their 50th anniversary year? ""I think you will have Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren setting the pace. I don't see that any of them are going to have any degree of dominance. I think it will be a lot tighter,"" says Scarborough. ""But like last year I think you're going to get spurious results in the first third/half of the year as teams get to grips with the tires. You're going to have a situation like last year where Maldanardo can win in a Williams because they got the tires working right."" ""The people who have built a good car and have the tires sussed out -- Sauber, Williams, Lotus -- could be quite threatening as well."" As for the technical aspects, Scarborough says look out for the development of the exhausts and sidepods and DRS. Perhaps the most intriguing technical unknowns lie with how teams develop their exhausts, sidepods and their Drag Reduction System (known as DRS), says Scarborough. ""(DRS) is a bit of a killer app-type solution. No one's got it working yet. There will be a number of teams who will try and run it at different races. But really the key thing will be how the teams manage the tires.""","Minor changes to F1 cars for 2013 prior to 'tsunami of regulatory change' in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- A Texas actress charged with sending ricin-tainted letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was found competent Wednesday to stand trial. Appearing in federal court in Texarkana, Texas, Shannon Richardson, 35, entered a plea of not guilty to all counts. Richardson, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, initially told the FBI that her husband, Nathaniel, had sent the ricin-laced letters, but a polygraph exam found her to be ""deceptive"" on the matter, authorities have said. Investigators found that her computer storage devices contained the text of threatening letters sent to the president, but the couple's computer records show that her husband couldn't have printed them out because he was at work at the time, according to an FBI arrest affidavit. Richardson later told investigators she mailed the ricin-tainted letters, but she claimed that her husband typed the letters and forced her to print and mail them, the affidavit said. Her husband denied involvement and claimed that his wife wanted to end their marriage and leave him. He told investigators that his wife was ""intentionally misleading"" them, court papers said.

"(CNN) -- Wildfires are fast-moving targets, so one of the most important weapons firefighting teams can have is timely, precise information about where the fire is, where it's likely to spread and what's in its path. In the past couple of years, firefighters have gained a significant advantage: aircraft equipped with heat-detecting infrared sensors and special communication equipment now can relay to firefighting teams on the ground, in minutes, a fire's precise location, as well as where new ""hotspots"" are cropping up, even before they burst into visible flame. ""When I was an incident commander, I would have killed for this kind of data,"" said Russ Johnson, the director of public safety and homeland/national security for Esri, one of the world's leading geographic information companies. In past decades he commanded operations to fight major wildfires, including the massive Yellowstone wildfires of 1988 which scorched about 1.2 million acres. Monitoring wildfires with infrared sensors from aircraft isn't new, but the level of detail and speed with which this data gets transmitted to firefighting teams has been revolutionized. ""Those aircraft used to have to fly at night, because you couldn't gather good thermal data during daylight hours,"" Johnson said. ""Then you'd have to wait for the plane to land, and then for the thermal imagery to be processed. If we were lucky, we'd get that information on printed maps by 4 or 5 in the morning -- just maybe in time to brief firefighters before they went out on the line. ""Today those flights can happen in daylight with vastly improved accuracy, and incident commanders get that data electronically in two minutes on a computer-based map. We now have accurate, almost real-time situational awareness on the spot. That makes all the difference."" Wildfires generally have a perimeter marked by an advancing line of flame. But burning debris gets sucked up into the column of hot air over the fire and deposited ahead of the fire line, often causing new spot fires where they land, up to half a mile away. These hotspots also can be caused by burning debris rolling downhill on a steep slope. Left unchecked, new hotspots can smolder invisibly for hours or days. ""Incident commanders and emergency responders who are managing fires need to make decisions on where to focus air drops of fire retardants and other resources,"" Johnson said. ""With this new hotspot information, all of a sudden I know: down there in that canyon, not visible yet, there's a hotspot. So let's divert some air assets to hold it while it's still small and later deploy firefighters there. That's so much better than discovering the hotspot only when it busts out of a canyon, when it's strong and harder and more dangerous to fight."" How does this data get to firefighting operations so fast? Generally it's transmitted over the Internet (via broadband or wireless carrier networks) on a secure website, which decision-makers and emergency responders can access via computers or smartphones. But where a direct connection to these conventional networks isn't available, that data can travel the ""last mile"" by packet radio, a technology long used by amateur radio operators. Meanwhile, brand new technology is also having an impact on fighting wildfires. Unmanned aircraft -- sometimes called ""drones"" -- also are starting to play a bigger role in fighting wildfires. According to Aero-News Network, as of June the Federal Aviation Administration had authorized nearly 60 private and government entities to operate unmanned aircraft systems in domestic airspace for many purposes, including fighting wildfires. In the latest issue of Earth Imaging Journal, Thomas Zajkowski, a remote sensing specialist with the U.S. Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center, explained that in addition to carrying sensors, drones also can help form a data transmission network to quickly transmit thermal imagery and other information to firefighting operations. But so far, firefighting reconnaissance drones aren't commonplace. Johnson said they've been used mainly ""when fires get politically visible. Once a fire becomes catastrophic, they turn the drones loose to collect information and data."" That's because it's complicated to work drones into firefighting procedures, especially for managing aircraft and air space over fire areas. Johnson explained, ""When there's a wildfire, emergency airspace gets declared. This restricts all aircraft near the incident. Procedures for managing drones along with air tankers and other aircraft would have to be built into that protocol. I think in the future, if drones can be cost-effectively and safely applied, they'll become very common and useful in fighting wildfires. But that's a few years down the road."" Satellites and even the International Space Station also help fight wildfires. In particular, satellites operated by NASA and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration can supply current data on wind direction and speed, as well as the dryness of surrounding areas. This can help predict where, and how fast, a fire will spread. An agreement signed in June will allow NASA and the U.S. Forest Service to collaborate on raising wildfire awareness. This partnership will highlight connections between wildfires, forest and plant growth research, and materials science. Zajkowski noted in Earth Imaging Journal: ""This joint effort is enhanced by the personal interest of astronaut Joe Acaba, a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station. Acaba is an avid outdoorsman who has focused much of his career on the environment. He selected Smokey Bear, the forest service's mascot, as the zero-gravity indicator and talisman for his Soyuz flight to the orbiting laboratory in May. ""Acaba and his crewmates recorded high-resolution video and photographs of recent wildfires in Colorado and Utah.""

"(CNN) -- In the white sand beaches of Yoff, the small fishing town just north of the Senegalese capital Dakar, a seemingly endless line of brightly colored boats dots the Atlantic seaside. It was here, about four years ago, that Spanish designer Ramon Llonch was first struck by the mysterious symbols and intricate patterns adorning the hand-painted wooden vessels. ""I was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats, many of which were old, damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned,"" remembers Llonch, who was at the time cycling solo around the West African country. ""I was captivated by that colorful mosaic of life with the women selling the fish and the men approaching the shore,"" he adds. Read this: African firm invests billions in U.S. Looking at the old, weathered canoes, Llonch started wondering whether he could find a new use for them while preserving the history of their owners. His idea was to work with skillful local craftsmen and breathe new life into the traditional ""pirogues"" by transforming them into hand-made furniture. And that's how Artlantique was born, a company repurposing boats that are no longer sea worthy into upcycled fittings -- anything from whimsical chairs and coffee tables to one-of-a-kind cabinets and even foosball tables. ""It's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the Atlantic, a life in Africa,"" says Llonch. ""Every time you see this furniture, you have a piece of the soul and the history of these fishermen,"" adds the 52-year-old designer. Long journey . From the waters off the coast of Senegal, through the Dakar-based workshop, to several stores across the world, the journey of transforming the old fishing boats into furniture is far from easy. Artlantique employs 12 craftsmen, including a co-ordinator who is in regular contact with the local fishermen about the purchase of those boats whose life span on the ocean waters has ended -- usually after 40 to 50 years of use. Read this: Can Africa unlock its solar potential? After transporting the boats into Artlantique's workshop, the company's master carpenters start the arduous task of dismantling the 12-meter long vessels. Once that's completed, they decide how to reconstruct the old samba wood -- depending on its size, condition and color combinations -- without any wood treatment or additional painting. Artlantique's eclectic creations are then shipped to Barcelona, Llonch's base, and from there they are sent to clients across Europe, as well as stores in New York and Tokyo. Passion for Africa . Llonch says that what makes the furniture special is the history behind it and the creativity of the artisans working with raw materials that are hard to remodel. ""The main reason of this project is to preserve the wood as it was, with all the stories, all the nautical miles sailed in Atlantic,"" says Llonch. Read this: Bamboo bikes put business on right track . ""This wood ... has certain limitations, not only because it has a shape but also because it's very damaged by the salt, the sea, the sun and the time. But these artisans are very talented,"" he adds. ""Their creativity is not academic, they are like this by nature because (for them) recycling and reusing is not a fashion, it's not a trend."" Looking ahead, Llonch says his goal is to expand the business and help other skilled craftsmen to develop their creative talents. ""Africa for me is a social inspiration, it's my passion,"" he says. ""We started with the fishing boats ... because I was astonished when I saw the beaches with these stylish boats but maybe this is just the beginning,"" adds Llonch. ""There is a lot of creativity that we can use and we can take from African artists -- I want to continue to collaborate and discover the African talent, this is my aim.""","Artlantique produces furniture made from old fishing boats in Senegal .

"(CNN) -- When the new Formula 1 season gets underway in March, for the first time there will be a woman running a team's entire operations from track to boardroom. The team is Sauber and the woman in charge is Monisha Kaltenborn, an Indian-born lawyer who has risen to the top in this male-dominated sport. Kaltenborn, 41, has been CEO of Sauber -- sixth in last year's team championship -- since 2010, but in October she also took over from Peter Sauber as team principal, putting her in charge of performance on the track as well as the business operation. ""As team principal you have a very exposed position at the track side,"" said Kaltenborn. ""It's really about the racing."" Kaltenborn has fought for recognition in a sport where another team boss -- whom she is too polite to name -- once mistook her for Peter Sauber's interpreter. ""It was an elderly gentleman who has a different kind of thinking,"" she said. ""He soon realized and was highly embarrassed."" Others have been more subtle, but still betray a surprise to see a woman in her job. ""It's the first moment when you are introduced with your title and you see a slight surprise,"" said Kaltenborn. ""I hope that my record will encourage more women and girls to come into motorsport."" Kaltenborn is a member and ambassador for the Women in Motorsport Commission set up by governing body, the FIA. The commission promotes women drivers in the FIA's karting and rally championships and has a network of national coordinators encouraging girls and women in their countries. ""There's a project in schools which looks at all the roles in the team from financial and technical to marketing, and 30% of participants are girls,"" she said. ""For me it's very important because we need to help women and young girls to be given the opportunity."" However, those hoping to see a woman Formula 1 driver reach a pole position anytime soon could be disappointed. ""I think it will take a while because it's a tough world out there to reach Formula 1,"" said Kaltenborn. ""There are just 22 drivers out of hundreds of thousands worldwide. ""It's important we start at the roots and groom the girls in the same way the boys are groomed."" For some, Formula 1's macho image and use of ""grid girls"" -- glamorous women who hold markers giving teams' grid position -- undermines its efforts to be taken seriously by women. Not for Kaltenborn, however. ""I don't have a problem with that image,"" she said. ""I think girls are prettier to look at than if you had men in those roles. ""There's nothing wrong with the image because nobody is being discriminated against."" See also: F1 revolution ahead after 'identikit' 2013 season . Kaltenborn was born Monisha Narang in Dehradun, India, and moved with her parents to Austria at the age of eight. Although her first ambition was to be an astronaut, she trained as a lawyer and had only a passing interest in Formula 1. ""I grew up in Austria and when I was a child, there were famous Austrian drivers like Niki Lauda and Gerhard Berger and a race in Austria, so I had a basic knowledge of the sport,"" she said. She never imagined, however, that she would make a career out of it until she was approached to join the legal team of Fritz Kaiser Group in 1998. Kaiser was a shareholder in what was then the Red Bull Sauber Formula 1 team. ""When I joined the company in Lichtenstein I saw what happens behind the scenes and there's so much more to it,"" she said. ""The first time I came to the factory and saw what it takes to make a Formula 1 car, it became a passion."" When Kaiser sold off his shares in the team, Kaltenborn moved to Hinwil in Switzerland to run Sauber Group's legal department. So began her inexorable rise through the company, joining its board in 2001, becoming CEO in 2010 and finally team principal in 2012. She is unusual in being a team principal with a legal, rather than a technical background, but insists it does not put her at a disadvantage. See: The most ambitious women on earth . ""With a legal background you learn to ask the right questions,"" said Kaltenborn. ""Most areas are so highly specialized that you hardly find a technical person who has detailed knowledge of all areas. People from different backgrounds enrich the sport."" Kaltenborn is married with two children, aged 10 and seven, and has to cope with a lot of time away from her family during the racing season. ""I'm often away, which makes it very tough, but they take it well. I try to have a lot of contact with them when I'm away,"" she said. It was not until 2011, however, that she took her children to a Formula 1 race, and they now go to the Monaco Grand Prix once a year. However, ""there's so much work and noise that it's not a place for little kids,"" she said. Kaltenborn's first full season in charge begins with the Australian Grand Prix on March 17. There is a new car -- the Sauber C32 Ferrari -- and a new team of drivers, German Niko Hulkenberg, recently signed from Sahara Force India, and Mexican Esteban Gutierrez, previously Sauber's reserve driver. For Kaltenborn, it will be a first chance to take full control of the team she has made her own.","Monisha Kaltenborn became Formula 1's first female team principal in October .

"(HLNtc.com) -- Basketball star Lamar Odom was arrested early Friday on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the California Highway Patrol said. The incident began at 3:25 a.m., when the 33-year-old athlete was observed driving in a ""serpentine manner at 50 mph,"" a highway patrol report said. Police pursued his white Mercedes SUV for about three miles before Odom stopped, the report says. Odom ""showed objective signs of intoxication and he was unable to perform his field sobriety tests,"" police said in a news release. He was taken to Van Nuys Jail, where he refused all chemical tests, it said. With bail set at $15,000, Odom was released at 8:30 a.m. with a promise to appear at the Van Nuys Courthouse on September 27. In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice. ""I've made a couple (of mistakes) and I may make a couple again, but hopefully they won't be as big as this one,"" Odom told reporters then.

"(CNN) -- As far as former world champion Mario Andretti is concerned the key to a successful rekindling of Formula One's American dream is a buzzword that has been flying around Washington faster than a Ferrari in recent weeks: stability. Days after the country entrusted Barack Obama to edge the United States towards economic recovery, motorsport royalty has descended on Texas in the latest attempt to ignite a lasting passion for F1 in a country with more motorheads to the pound than anywhere else on the planet. While the domestic Daytona and Indycar series thrive on continued popularity, Formula One can never claim to have set America alight, despite repeated efforts to foster a permanent place in the hearts of motorsport fans. That could all change in Austin, which has a purpose-built circuit to unveil as well as a 10-year deal to host an F1 race. And just like Obama relied heavily on the Latino vote to propel him back to power, F1 are also hoping to court a new swathe of Latin American fans, with Austin just 200 miles from the Mexican border. Andretti -- one of only two Americans ever to claim the F1 world title -- is convinced this latest attempt to grow the sport in both North and South America can succeed, and mirror the success it enjoyed at the Watkins Glen circuit in New York between 1961 and 1980. ""I think F1 fans in the United States can begin to rejoice,"" he told CNN World Sport. ""I just keep saying this; Formula One's fan base in America is very much underestimated, but they need to have some stability which I think we will finally achieve. ""The new facility in Austin is going to be a beautiful site. This is what the U.S. has really needed and from here on, starting this year, I think we can look forward to the race happening every year and at a place we will be very proud (of). ""The fact Austin is down in the southern part of Texas, easily reachable by South American fans -- you've got Mexico, Brazil, Argentina -- many of them are fertile grounds for F1."" Despite an association stretching back over half a century, Formula One and the States have never got beyond the dating stage, enjoying an on-off relationship that has spawned 41 races at nine different venues. Since the first race was staged at the Sebring Circuit in Florida in 1959, the United States Grand Prix has been through places like Detroit, Indianapolis and Las Vegas, enjoying only one true period of permanency, at Watkins Glen. That 19-year stint in upstate New York counted as the sport's golden years in America as bumper crowds flocked to the tree-lined track, bathed in fall colors, to watch the world's best do battle. Jackie Stewart, a three-time world champion, recalls how the small town would be swamped by drivers, teams and supporters, who all congregated around ""the bog"" -- a patch of quicksand-like mud induced by an invasion of trucks and cars -- or the famous Glen Motor Inn. But once the track was deemed too dangerous, the USGP was on the move again, even being upstaged in Scottsdale, Arizona by a camel race -- surely a low point in the competition's 62-year history. ""It was a street race, and for the same reason -- the quality of the road surface -- it never lasted for very long,"" Stewart explained. ""Apparently the biggest downside was that there was a camel race on the same weekend that drew a larger crowd than a Formula One race, which was very telling about America's understanding of Formula One. ""Had there been a Nascar race there, or an Indycar race, it would have been a different story."" Formula One didn't fare much better at its most recent home in Indianapolis. A dispute over tires in 2005 led to a host of drop outs and a race involving just six cars, much to the embarrassment of the sport's authorities. But now, with a purpose-built race track, funded by a private investor, and a decade-long commitment to race in Texas, perhaps Formula One will finally get a foothold in a lucrative market which could help drive it towards a bigger and brighter future. Stewart told CNN World Sport: ""I think Austin, Texas has an even better chance, because they're building a stadium, a Formula One road racing stadium. ""Formula One needs the United States. There is a huge car market. I know now China is bigger, I know India is bigger and if not, going to be bigger, but the United States of America is still huge. ""We need to get a home there, where Formula One could be developed, and it could be seen as the sophisticated end of Formula One, of motorsport. But why shouldn't there be, if there's 300 million people in America, if we just got 10 per cent of them, that's a huge audience. ""And when we go to a little country, population-wise, like Australia, we have more than 300,000 people coming for the long weekend of the Australian Grand Prix. And they don't have a background like America has, of motorsport."" At one stage it appeared the United States' appetite for F1 was insatiable. Despite Watkins Glen's long association coming to an end in 1981, the following season there were an unprecedented three American races, as Detroit, Las Vegas and Long Beach all welcomed the sport. Though that particular hat-trick lasted just one season, Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone is keen for a return to the glory days and is desperate to add a second U.S. race to the modern-day roster. New Jersey had been included on a provisional 2013 calendar but organizers have been forced to postpone for a year as they continue to grapple with financial issues. Ecclestone has long pined for a grand prix in the picturesque city of New York, but whether a second race appears in the Big Apple or in neighboring New Jersey, Andretti is confident the U.S has a sufficient appetite for two visits a season. ""America as large as it is can easily support two races -- one would feed off the other,"" he explained. ""I just can't see a negative in any way. I know Bernie Ecclestone for many years has wanted to have something in the proximity of New York for obvious reasons. ""And with the event there and the backdrop of Manhattan, it's going to provide the ambience they're looking for. I think both venues could be very attractive.""","Formula One returns to the U.S. for the first time since 2007 this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia said Wednesday that national elections would take place in September, giving unusually lengthy notice to voters and her opponents of a hard campaign ahead. In a speech in the national capital, Canberra, Gillard gave a somber assessment of the economic and social challenges that Australia is facing under her Labor government, which is struggling in opinion polls. She said that announcing the timetable for the September vote now would end ""speculation about election timing"" and give ""shape and order to the year."" But some commentators suggested that in trying to give the country more clarity, she was in fact creating a drawn-out ordeal for voters. ""Julia Gillard has consigned Australians to something approaching a national pregnancy,"" wrote Tony Wright, national affairs editor at The Age, a daily newspaper. Federal election campaigns in Australia traditionally last around six weeks, far shorter than presidential races in the United States. Wright said that a 10 week campaign in Australia in 1984 left voters tired and ""tetchy"" and hurt the party of the incumbent prime minister at the time, Bob Hawke. ""No more long campaigns became the unbreakable mantra,"" Wright said, noting that the September 14 date set by Gillard is 32 weeks away. Gillard, 51, said in her speech Wednesday that the aim of giving such exceptionally advanced notice was to make the year ""one not of fevered campaigning, but of cool and reasoned deliberation."" Dennis Shanahan, political editor of The Australian, a national broadsheet newspaper said that although Gillard was giving up the advantage of surprise that she held over the opposition, she would have the chance to leverage the benefits of her incumbency. ""The prime minister has ensured that she will be able to maximize the effect of being in office, governing, working and being in parliament while people see her as the prime minister,"" Shanahan said. Her main challenger, Tony Abbott, the leader of the opposition, said he welcomed the announcement of the date. Abbott, 55, said his coalition was ""ready"" and suggested that the election campaign would focus on themes like tax, regulation and freedoms. Gillard, who managed to form a government after a tight election in 2010, could have set the election date as late as November 30 under Australia's three-year election cycle. But Shanahan said he thought she was also moving to head off any potential challenges to her position from within her party. In the summer of 2010, Gillard replaced the prime minister at the time, Kevin Rudd, whose ratings were suffering after he placed his proposed carbon emissions trading plan on the back burner and introduced a hefty tax on the country's powerful mining industry. Tensions remained in the party over her ascension to the prime minister's office, with some calling it a palace coup. Rudd unsuccessfully challenged her leadership last year. Under Gillard's announcement Wednesday, the House of Representatives will be dissolved on August 12. The elections will involve the entire House of Representatives and half the Senate.","Julia Gillard says national elections will take place in September .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, delivered the official Republican Party response to President Obama's State of the Union speech on Tuesday night. Here is a transcript of Ryan's speech. Ryan: Good evening. I'm Congressman Paul Ryan from Janesville, Wisconsin, and chairman here at the House Budget Committee. President Obama just addressed a congressional chamber filled with many new faces. One face we did not see tonight was that of our friend and colleague, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. We all miss Gabby and her cheerful spirit, and we are praying for her return to the House chamber. Earlier this month, President Obama spoke movingly at a memorial event for the six people who died on that violent morning in Tucson. Still, there are no words that can lift the sorrow that now engulfs the families and the friends of the fallen. What we can do is assure them that the nation is praying for them, that, in the words of the psalmist, the lord heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds, and that over time grace will replace grief. As Gabby continues to make encouraging progress, we must keep her and the others in our thoughts as we attend to the work now before us. Tonight, the president focused a lot of attention on our economy in general, and on our deficit and debt in particular. He was right to do so, and some of his words were reassuring. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, I assure you that we want to work with the president to restrain federal spending. In one of our first acts in the new majority, House Republicans voted to cut Congress' own budget. And just today, the House voted to restore the spending discipline that Washington sorely needs. The reason is simple. A few years ago, reducing spending was important. Today, it's imperative. Here's why. We face a crushing burden of debt. The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead. On this current path, when my three children -- who are now 6, 7, and 8 years old -- are raising their own children, the federal government will double in size, and so will the taxes they pay. No economy can sustain such high levels of debt and taxation. The next generation will inherit a stagnant economy and a diminished country. Frankly, it's one of my greatest concerns as a parent, and I know many of you feel the same way. Our debt is the product of acts by many presidents and many Congresses over many years. No one person or party is responsible for it. There's no doubt the president came into office facing a severe fiscal and economic situation. Unfortunately, instead of restoring the fundamentals of economic growth, he engaged in a stimulus spending spree that not only failed to deliver on his promise to create jobs, but also plunged us even deeper into debt. The facts are clear: Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25% for domestic government agencies, an 84% increase when you include the failed stimulus. All of this new government spending was sold as ""investment."" Yet after two years, the unemployment rate remains above 9%, and government has added over $3 trillion to our debt. Then the president and his party made matters even worse, by creating a new open-ended health care entitlement. What we already know about the president's health care law is this: Costs are going up, premiums are rising, and millions of people will lose the coverage they currently have. Job creation is being stifled by all of its taxes, penalties, mandates and fees. Businesses and unions from around the country are asking the Obama administration for waivers from the mandates. Washington should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. The president mentioned the need for regulatory reform to ease the burden on American businesses. We agree. And we think his health care law would be a great place to start. Last week, House Republicans voted for a full repeal of this law, as we pledged to do, and we will work to replace it with fiscally responsible, patient-centered reforms that actually reduce costs and expand coverage. Health care spending is driving the explosive growth of our debt. And the president's law is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy. Our debt is out of control. What was a fiscal challenge is now a fiscal crisis. We cannot deny it. Instead we must, as Americans, confront it responsibly. And that is exactly what Republicans pledge to do. Americans are skeptical of both political parties, and that skepticism is justified, especially when it comes to spending. So hold all of us accountable. In this very room, the House will produce, debate and advance a budget. Last year, in an unprecedented failure, Congress chose not to pass or even propose a budget. The spending spree continued unchecked. We owe you a better choice and a different vision. Our forthcoming budget is our obligation to you, to show you how we would do things differently, how we will cut spending to get the debt down, help create jobs and prosperity, and reform government programs. If we act soon, and if we act responsibly, people in and near retirement will be protected. These budget debates are not just about the programs of government; they're also about the purpose of government. So I'd like to share with you the principles that guide us. They are anchored in the wisdom of the founders, in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, and in the words of the American Constitution. They have to do with the importance of limited government and with the blessing of self-government. We believe government's role is both vital and limited, to defend the nation from attack and provide for the common defense, to secure our borders, to protect innocent life, to uphold our laws and constitutional rights, to ensure domestic tranquility and equal opportunity, and to provide a safety net -- to help provide a safety net for those who cannot provide for themselves. We believe that the government has an important role to create the conditions that promote entrepreneurship, upward mobility and individual responsibility. We believe, as our founders did, that the pursuit of happiness depends on individual liberty, and individual liberty requires limited government. Limited government also means effective government. When government takes on too many tasks, it usually doesn't do any of them very well. It's no coincidence that trust in government is at an all-time low now that the size of government is at an all-time high. The president and the Democratic leadership have shown, by their actions, that they believe government needs to increase its size and its reach, its price tag and its power. Whether sold as stimulus or repackaged as investment, their actions show they want a federal government that controls too much, taxes too much and spends too much in order to do too much. And during the last two years, that is exactly what we have gotten -- along with record deficits and debt -- to the point where the president is now urging Congress to increase the debt limit. We believe the days of business as usual must come to an end. We hold to a couple of simple convictions: Endless borrowing is not a strategy. Spending cuts have to come first. Our nation is approaching a tipping point. We are at a moment where, if government's growth is left unchecked and unchallenged, America's best century will be considered our past century. This is a future in which we will transform our social safety net into a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency. Depending on bureaucracy to foster innovation, competitiveness and wise consumer choices has never worked, and it won't work now. We need to chart a new course. Speaking candidly, as one citizen to another, we still have time, but not much time. If we continue down our current path, we know what our future will be. Just take a look at what's happening to Greece, Ireland, the United Kingdom and other nations in Europe. They didn't act soon enough, and now their governments have been forced to impose painful austerity measures, large benefit cuts to seniors and huge tax increases on everybody. Their day of reckoning has arrived. Ours is around the corner. That is why we have to act now. Some people will back away from this challenge. But I see this challenge as an opportunity to rebuild what Lincoln called the central ideas of the republic. We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper. Under this approach, the spirit of initiative -- not political clout -- determines who succeeds. Millions of families have fallen on hard times not because of our ideals of free enterprise, but because our leaders failed to live up to those ideals, because of poor decisions made in Washington and Wall Street that caused a financial crisis, squandered our savings, broke our trust and crippled our economy. Today, a similar kind of irresponsibility threatens not only our livelihoods, but our way of life. We need to reclaim our American system of limited government, low taxes, reasonable regulations and sound money, which has blessed us with unprecedented prosperity. And it has done more to help the poor than any other economic system ever designed. That's the real secret to job creation, not borrowing and spending more money in Washington. Limited government and free enterprise have helped make America the greatest nation on Earth. These are not easy times, but America is an exceptional nation. In all the chapters of human history, there has never been anything quite like America. The American story has been cherished, advanced and defended over the centuries. And it now falls to this generation to pass onto our children a nation that is stronger, more vibrant, more decent and better than the one we inherited. Thank you, and good night.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- One week after Superstorm Sandy beat up the Northeast, tearing apart homes and lives in New Jersey, New York and other areas, there's another worry on the horizon: A nor'easter is coming. Rain is forecast to move in early Wednesday and will gradually become heavier, according to CNN meteorologists. As the day goes on, the weather will get worse, with daytime temperatures hovering in the 40s. At night it could get down to the 20s -- bad news for the 127,000 customers who are still without power, according to Con Edison. Working round the clock, the company said Tuesday that more than 846,000 customers who lost power -- 87% -- have it again. A nor'easter is a strong low pressure system with powerful northeasterly winds coming from the ocean ahead of a storm. Predicted 60-mph gusts could hurt the already ravaged Jersey Shore. Coastal flooding and beach erosion are possible. Of course there's a strong concern for everyone's safety, too. Sandy left 110 people dead in the United States, and on its way to the country, it took the lives of 69 people. ""When it rains, it pours. When it storms, you get more storms, I guess,"" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Under normal conditions, the nor'easter wouldn't be problematic, he said, but because many areas are still picking up the pieces from last week, it could cause fresh havoc. On Monday, authorities in Brick, New Jersey, ordered residents in the low-lying waterfront areas of town to leave. The storm is not another Sandy, and its path and severity could change, according to CNN meteorologists. How you can help . ""I haven't even really thought about the nor'easter,"" said Ryan Hanley. The 27-year-old's chief worry is the home she had to abandon in Wantagh, on New York's Long Island. It's 4 feet deep in water. All her belongings are on the curb. ""I cannot think right now about voting (in Tuesday's presidential election) either,"" she said. ""I don't even know where to go if I wanted to vote."" To help with such concerns, Cuomo signed an order Monday allowing affidavit voting. Basically, what that means is that voters registered in a federally declared disaster county can vote at any poll site in the state by signing an affidavit. ""We want everyone to vote. Just because you're displaced doesn't mean you should be disenfranchised,"" the governor said. Voters in some New York counties may get an extra day to cast ballots if disruptions caused by Sandy prevent enough citizens from voting, a state official said Sunday. New Jersey announced that residents displaced by Sandy can vote in Tuesday's elections via e-mail or fax, the first time civilians in the state have been allowed to vote remotely. At least two polling places in Connecticut have been changed due to Sandy -- one in Bridgeport and another in New London. Signs that people are working hard to move on after Sandy can be found across New York. Construction work started again Monday at the 9/11 ground zero site, which was flooded by Sandy. Some 94% of schools in New York City were open Monday, according to the mayor, and the subway system is back in operation. New York officials said they are investigating reports of price gouging after receiving hundreds of complaints from consumers who say business owners have jacked up prices on hotel rooms, generators, food and water. In everyday lives, progress can't come fast enough. Hanley is living with her boyfriend's family a few towns away from Wantagh, and her confusion about where to vote is a secondary concern right now. ""I've heard from neighbors who are still around there that we've had looters,"" she said. ""What am I supposed to do right now? How do I deal with that?"" she said. ""I don't have electricity, so I cannot pump the water. It is just sitting there. Whether someone takes what we have ... I have no control over that. I have no control over any of it."" Hanley has been talking with her insurance company. But she said she hasn't been able to reach a real person with the Federal Emergency Management Agency yet. ""We have not been directly contacted, nor can we reach anyone when we call,"" she said. FEMA has defended its response to people in need. While Hanley struggles with the bureaucracy of post-disaster life, many others are receiving help from the Red Cross, which has opened 190 shelters along the Eastern Seaboard. The organization has hundreds of disaster workers on standby with emergency supplies. 'It's a humbling experience' Katie Fairley, a Staten Islander who lives in New Dorp, one of the harder-hit areas, said she's seen people sleeping in their cars. A 51-year-old vice president for finance at a health care facility, Fairley said lines for food and for gas are blocks long. ""Thank God, we have each other here,"" she said, insisting that Staten Islanders have been forgotten. Another Staten Islander, Tara Saylor, spent her weekend volunteering to hand out clothing and food. The 25-year-old works at a Manhattan interior design showroom. She and her home on a hill in St. George escaped Sandy's wrath. Helping people touched her deeply. ""I was almost crying when people are thanking me,"" she said. ""(They were) throwing their family photos out in the middle of the street. It's a humbling experience. You really begin to appreciate what you have."" In the Long Island community of Floral Park, Kevin Cordova's family members tried cooking hot food to stay warm and wore their coats indoors. His house is uninhabitable, thanks to Sandy. ""There's really no amount of blankets that can stop you from being cold in 30-degree weather,"" the 28-year-old said. ""We feel a little homeless right now. We have our house, but we can't really use it."" Teacher: 'I want them to tell their stories' To the southwest in Red Bank, New Jersey, about a 90-minute drive from Floral Park, Chris Ippolito has been luckier than many folks. So far, he's only had to wrestle with sporadic power outages. But his mother-in-law's home was severely flooded. Her historic house, more than 100 years old, sat a block from the ocean in Monmouth County. Her family built it, and she spent her childhood there. She left the house before Sandy hit, so she's physically all right. But she's devastated by the loss. ""It's incredibly difficult for her,"" Ippolito said. Things are returning to some semblance of normalcy, he said. CNN reached Ippolito shortly after he had delivered food and supplies to a local firehouse. ""Businesses are breathing back to life,"" he said. ""Schools are limping back to life."" Ippolito is a high school teacher. His district is closed for now, but he's thinking about all his students. ""I want them to tell their stories, to feel like they can open up if they want or need to,"" he said. He'll use his free time Tuesday to cast his vote for president. ""I understand that voting isn't the priority for a lot of people who are dealing with more immediate needs,"" he said. ""But I'm not going to miss it.""","Roughly 94% of schools in New York City are open .

"(CNN) -- This week, the world is learning that on August 21, Syria's Assad regime attacked civilians living on the outskirts of Damascus, killing at least 355 of them, including many small children. According to Vice President Joe Biden, there is ""no doubt"" that chemical weapons were used by the regime -- and not, as the Assad government has claimed, by rebel forces. The victims suffered terrible and painful deaths. Many experts are concluding that most likely a nerve agent such as sarin was deployed. Sarin is a type of organophosphate (OP), a class of chemicals used for making herbicides, insecticides and nerve gases. The effects of sarin and other OPs on the human body are profound, shocking and can be long lasting. Some exposures have left the surviving victims paralyzed for weeks, with perhaps permanent liver malfunctions and lingering neurological dysfunctions. OPs disintegrate in a matter of hours. But during their comparatively brief period of volatile danger, the deadly molecules can pass through human skin, nostrils, lungs and eyes to enter the bloodstream and then the brain. If enough of it gets inside the brain to saturate the nervous system, an agonizing death follows. I first learned about sarin gas in 1978 when I was hired by the California Department of Food and Agriculture to assess the human health impacts of 33,000 pesticide formulations used by farmers and pest eradication companies. Obviously the state wasn't serious about this. Who hires a 26-year-old graduate student immunologist to, by herself, evaluate so many chemicals? What I found was that among the tens of thousands of chemicals used by growers and pest eradicators around the world, the most potent and popular were, and still are, the organophosphates. They kill insects by blocking proper regulation of the key chemical used by nerve cells, acetylcholine. (OPs became popular for agricultural use after DDT and some other chemicals were banned because they persist almost indefinitely in the environment.) But now and then, a farmworker might inhale the odorless, tasteless OP chemicals when unknowingly downwind of a large pesticide spraying, and the ghastly neurological symptoms and deaths would ensue. To understand how and why such dangerous compounds had come into common use, I dug backwards in the scientific literature, landing on the 1938 invention of the first member of this chemical family, sarin, developed by German chemist Gerhard Schrader. Though Schrader started down the sarin path in search of agricultural chemicals, he recognized its utility as a nerve gas and aided his military in its development and use during WWII. During the Cold War, the United States, United Kingdom and Soviet Union all developed deadlier forms of OPs, including VX gas. In 1993, the U.N.'s Chemical Weapons Convention banned sarin, VX and other nerve gases. The CWC also targeted compounds used to make deadly gases, such as methylphosphonyl difluoride -- a harmless chemical until mixed with rubbing alcohol, creating sarin. The CWC was signed by 162 nations, including the U.S. and Soviet Union. But Syria has never signed it, and the regime of Bashar al-Assad has stockpiled ready-to-mix methylphosphonyl difluoride in vast quantities. Three decades ago, I found it shocking to learn that so much OP pesticides used annually in the United States to control insects were, chemically, close siblings to those deployed for genocidal purposes. But then it came back as a weapon of war. On March 16, 1988, the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein showered the Kurdish village of Halabja with multiple chemical agents, including sarin, killing several thousand civilians. This was the largest-scale chemical weapons attack in modern history. Seven years later, the first terrorist use of sarin occurred in Tokyo, carried out by the strange religious cult Aum Shinrikyo. On March 20, 1995, the group released sarin in the city's subway system, killing 13 people and injuring more than 6000, with many requiring hospitalization. More recently, an apparently corrupt principal in India fed children in her school cheap, OP-contaminated lunches, killing at least 25 youngsters. Witnesses described the children's hideous deaths as the pesticides caused their nervous systems to send signals to their muscles, leading to spasms and seizures. And then, in response, their lungs became paralyzed and the terrified children gasped and suffocated until they died. In December, The New York Times and WIRED magazine reported that the Assad government was moving some of its chemical weapons in an apparent preparation for an attack. The deadly stockpile was stored in a safe form. A launchable shell is divided in half by a thin membrane. On one side is rubbing alcohol, on the other, methylphosphonyl difluoride. Divided, the chemicals pose no hazard and can easily be transported and stored. But upon detonation, the membrane bursts, the chemicals mix, sarin gas is made and it showers upon those unfortunates below. In March, sarin was used in Syria in a small attack. U.N. investigators have testimony that rebel forces may have used it. This month's attacks outside of Damascus, however, was clearly carried out by the Assad regime, according to the U.S and Britain. A year ago on August 20, President Barack Obama made his now-famous ""red line"" remark, stating: ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation."" That was the diplomatic line in the sand for the U.S. In October of the same year, Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's foreign minister at the time, addressed the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and drew his line. I asked him, ""If the Syrian government makes use of its well-known stockpiles of either biological or chemical weapons, and the wind blows said weapons across your border, claiming Iranian lives, will this be considered a national security threat?"" ""Certainly, that situation is a situation that will end everything,"" Salehi said. Iran is the key ally of the Assad regime. But what if powerful winds were to carry sarin or other chemical weapons from Syria to the Iranian border? Salehi added, ""that is the end of the validity, eligibility, legality, whatever you name it, of that government. Weapons of mass destruction, as we said, is against humanity. It's something that is not at all acceptable. And therefore, if your hypothesis, God forbid, ever materializes, I think nobody can justify it anymore, nobody can go along with anybody who has been involved in such act of -- I would say inhuman act."" The Assad regime is playing with regional fire. While the possibility of a wind carrying sarin to far-away Iran might be ridiculous, the Lebanese border is merely 15 miles from Damascus and Jordan's is 70 miles away. A ""new normal"" has descended over the Middle East since the 2011 Arab Spring, pushing ever more dangerous boundaries of instability and brutality, mass refugee exoduses, tough military crackdowns, suicide bombings, demolition of mosques and Coptic churches and spread of diseases. It would be nightmarish in the extreme were use of chemical weapons -- deployment for purposes of mass asphyxiation -- to join the awful ""new normal"" litany of despair. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laurie Garrett.","Syria's Assad regime is accused of using chemical weapons on civilians .
Laurie Garrett: Sarin probably was deployed; those who die from it suffer terribly .
She says sarin was developed in WWII era as a potent form of destruction .

"New York (CNN) -- After losing a lengthy legal battle to avoid extradition to the United States, Egyptian-born cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri confronted a host of terror charges Saturday when he was presented before a federal judge in Manhattan. The one-eyed radical preacher faces 11 terrorism-related charges and is one of five men who departed England late Friday, hours after the High Court in London ruled the men could be extradited ""immediately."" Amid high security, authorities temporarily removed al-Masri's prosthetic limbs, devices he uses after apparently sustaining injuries in Afghanistan. Two planes carrying the men left the British Air Force base Mildenhall so they could face trial in the United States, Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement. Al-Masri will be arraigned Tuesday morning, officials said. Separately, Khaled al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary pleaded not guilty before a judge Saturday. The trio are being held at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. Two others, Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan, clad in green and yellow prison jumpsuits, also pleaded not guilty Saturday before a judge in New Haven, Connecticut, according to the U.S. Attorney's office there. ""The extraditions of Abu Hamza, Bary and al-Fawwaz are a major milestone in our effort to see these alleged high-level terrorists face American justice,"" said FBI New York acting assistant director-in-charge Mary Galligan. ""When an indictment alleges the murderous intent of international terrorists, the government will not waver in its determination to achieve justice, no matter how long it takes."" BBC apologizes to Queen Elizabeth over Abu Hamza revelation . The charges against al-Masri include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen, and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. The cases of Ahmad and Ahsan are both linked to a website called azzam.com, which U.S. prosecutors say was run by the two men to support terrorism around the world. Meanwhile, al-Fawwaz and Bary are accused of being al Qaeda associates of Osama bin Laden in London during the 1990s. Al-Masri is one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britain, where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north London mosque and other terrorism-related charges. Born in Egypt in 1958, he traveled to Britain to study before gaining citizenship through marriage in the 1980s. A one-time nightclub bouncer in London's Soho district, al-Masri -- also known as Mustafa Kamal Mustafa -- has said he lost both hands and one eye while fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He often wears a hook in place of one hand. In 1997, al-Masri became the imam of a north London mosque, where his hate-filled speeches attacking the West began to attract national attention and followers, including Richard Reid, the so-called ""shoe bomber"" who attempted to blow up a Miami-bound passenger airplane three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Al-Masri has called the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center ""a towering day in history"" and described bin Laden as ""a good guy and a hero."" He also described the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003 as ""punishment from Allah"" because the astronauts were Christian, Hindu and Jewish. Lawyers for al-Masri told the British court their client suffers from deteriorating mental health and was unfit to plead. CNN's Raelyn Johnson, Jonathan Wald, Andrew Carey and Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","Abu Hamza al-Masri confronts a host of terror charges Saturday in federal court .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The death of a four-year-old girl run over by a bulldozer in rural China has triggered outrage on Chinese social media, rekindling anger over the issue of forced evictions. The victim, named in reports as Hong Xiaorou, was struck by the bulldozer in Zhangpu County in the southern Chinese province of Fujian at about 11am local time Wednesday, a spokesperson for the county's publicity department told CNN. The girl subsequently died in hospital, and the driver was arrested. The state-run China Daily reported that the girl's grandmother, Chen Saijiao, of Linqian village, had attempted to stop a bulldozer she spotted pushing mud on one of her fields. It reported that she could not be understood by the driver, who spoke a different dialect, and he accidentally backed over the girl who was playing behind his vehicle. Pictures of the girl's mourning family sparked an angry reaction on Chinese social media, where it was perceived as a result of a land grab by local officials. ""There are so many people killed or disabled because of land grabs in China, and (the officials) usually resolve these things with little compensation,"" wrote somebody using the handle @yongbao_ai on the popular micro-blogging service Sina Weibo. ""This is no big deal, all demolitions in (this area) are forced. It will be fine once people get used to it,"" another commenter using the handle @disanjihuasha remarked sarcastically. Land seizures, driven by soaring prices and Beijing's push for urban expansion, has been a major source of popular discontent in China, often resulting in violent stand-offs between officials and the public. Farmers have little legal recourse when their land is earmarked for requisition, and compensation is typically slight. Amnesty International identified land grabs and forced evictions as a major human rights issue facing China's leadership, saying the increasing volume of lawless forced evictions constitutes a breach of China's human rights obligations ""on an enormous scale."" But some officials have defended the process as a necessary evil of modernization. Zhangpu County publicity department issued a statement Wednesday saying workers building a path near Chen's fields had mistakenly pushed mud onto one of her fields. The department spokesperson said the death was an accident that had ""absolutely no relation"" to the land grab issue. County officials had met with the girl's parents and were in discussions with them about compensation, the spokesperson said.","Girl, 4, dies after being run over by a bulldozer in Fujian Province, China .

Many saw the incident as an consequence of land grabs by officials .

"(CNN) -- An Ontario mom is speaking out after a family received an anonymous letter imploring them to move or euthanize their autistic son because of the ""nuisance"" the teen poses to the community. Posting on a blog about special-needs children, Karla Begley wrote, ""I will not stoop to an insulting level. What I have to say is about tolerance, acceptance and respect for kids with special needs."" It was a tempered response compared to the insults leveled at the family and her 13-year-old son, Max. ""That noise he makes when he is outside is DREADFUL! Its (sic) scares the hell out of my normal children!!!!!"" Wrote the author, who signed the letter ""one pissed off mother."" ""They should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and donate it to science,"" the letter said. ""If Max's sounds bother someone, I'd hope that person would let us know in a respectful way,"" Begley countered in her Wednesday post to lovethatmax.com. ""Give us a chance to handle it instead of being cowardly about it."" Durham Regional Police consulted with the Crown Attorney's Office to see whether the letter, which among other things told the family to ""go live in a trailer in the woods with your wild animal kid"" and to ""(do) the right thing and move or euthanize him!"" constituted a hate crime. It does not, however. ""Despite the hateful language used, the Crown Attorney's office has advised that the content of the letter falls below the threshold for a hate crime"" police said in a recent statement. ""However,"" It continued, ""there are other criminal code issues that are being considered. A criminal investigation is currently underway."" Max's father, James Begley, told CNN he spoke with detectives recently and is encouraged by the investigation. ""They feel like they have a good lead,"" he said. ""It sounds like they are onto something."" The letter was delivered to Max's grandmother's house, about 15 minutes from the Begley home in Oshawa, a town 40 miles from Toronto. The letter writer has not been identified by authorities, and police have asked people to give them any information on the case. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","A letter sent to an Ontario woman's house calls her grandson a ""nuisance""
