"By . Dan Bloom . Until yesterday, its most thrilling tweet was 'Our proposal to protect clean water does not change the permitting exemption for farm ponds'. But it seems staffers at the Environmental Protection Agency have a wild side - after a mystery Kim Kardashian addict linked their iPhone game to the government account. The EPA's Office of Water stunned its 52,000 followers yesterday when the player announced he or she had become a 'C-list celebrity' on the addictive app. Everyone's addicted: The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Water stunned its 52,000 followers yesterday when a mystery player announced he or she was playing Kim Kardashian's smartphone game . The tweet - which said 'I'm now a C-List celebrity in Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Come join me and become famous too by playing on iPhone!' - was reportedly retweeted 3,000 times before being quietly deleted. No response has been offered by the EPA, so it is not known whether the account was hacked or a staff member was playing on taxpayers' time. But that didn't stop a wave of amusement on the social networking site, where users adored - or feared - the idea of stern bureaucrats secretly trying to become celebs.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Millennials may not be getting jobs because they value their smart phone more than they value things like personal hygiene and body odor. In data released on Monday by the Bank of America Trends in Consumer Mobility report, 1,000 adults were interviewed about how they value objects in their everyday lives. Only 87 per cent said that deodorant was important to them compared to 93 per cent who said that a smartphone was important. Millennials may bot be getting jobs because their smart phones than they acre about wearing deodorant . 91 per cent said that toothbrushes were important. Older adults cited deodorant and smartphones as equal in their everyday lives with the toothbrush ranking the highest importance at 95 per cent. NBC interviewed Susan RoaAne, the author of How to Work a Room, a book that gives workforce hopefuls advice on how to land a job. 'If people can smell you before they see you, you aren't getting the job,' said RoAne. Employees who let their personal hygiene slip after getting hired are also less likely to get promoted or get hired in a position that requires face to face contact with clients or CEOS. To make things even more difficult for recent graduates, unemployment in the workforce is high. The number of youths in the work force continues to drop and it may be because they don't wear deodorant or don't want to work . Older adults said that they cared about wearing deodorant just as much as they cared about using their smart phone . Data from May claims that unemployment among 25 to 34 year olds was 6.7 per cent. Unemployment went up a bit from April where it slightly lower at 6.6 per cent. Unemployment for those aged 20-24 is 11.1 per cent which is up from 10.6 per cent. Unemployment for all adults aged 20 and older is 5.8 per cent. Even though deodorant may keep the younger generation from entering the workforce, some evidence suggests that  millennials don't even really want jobs. Steve Toback, the managing partner of Invisor Consulting, told NBC that millennials have their own version of entrepreneurship where they don't even need to leave their 'parents basement.' 'What entrepreneurialism is for many of them is hanging out in their parents' basement or their childhood bedroom with their smartphone, calling themselves the CEO of this one-person company,' said Tobak. 'It's sad, but you don't need personal hygiene when you're the only person in the business.' Toback says that even while starting a business is admirable, getting some experience working for another company before starting one's own is a good idea. 'Experience is the best teacher,' said Toback. 'But buy some deodorant before you get out there.'","1,000 adults were surveyed for the Bank of America Trends in Consumer Mobility report .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A husband who shot his terminally ill wife before turning the gun on himself left a tape recorded message saying 'I can’t live without her', an inquest heard. Father-of-three Peter Seager, 69, and his 62-year-old wife Daphne Seager, were both found dead at home by their children with wounds to the head, a hearing into their deaths was told. In a dictaphone recording played to the inquest, retired gas fitter Mr Seager said: 'We were always meant to be together and always be one. Found dead: Peter and Daphne Seager were found at their home on this street in Dagenham, Essex, by their grown children, who had been left messages explaining their actions, an inquest heard . 'But life hasn't dictated that for us and we’re faced with being left alone and we don’t want to be alone. 'No pain, no problems, no nothing. Please don’t think down on me, that I took your mum away from you. It’s our choice, it’s what we want. Please forgive us for what we are going to do.' Police discovered two guns next to the couple. Mr Seager left the message for his family after killing his wife, a retired dinner lady, on the day she was due to return to a hospice. After Mr Seager finished speaking his wife also left a message, in a weak and barely audible voice. She said: 'I'm sorry for what I'm going to do. I love you, I love you lots. Bye.' Mrs Seager, of Dagenham, Essex, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. But just months before her death in June 2013 shed was told it had spread to her brain. Because she was left weak and bed-ridden she stayed at St Francis Hospice in Romford from April 21 before returning home two months later. Walthamstow Coroner’s Court heard Mr and Mrs Seager lived at home with their two sons, Derrick and Nicholas. Nicholas found a note alongside the dictaphone in the early hours of June 4 in his room, which told him not to go downstairs. In a statement read to the court Derrick Seager, who discovered his parents’ bodies, said: 'Around 3:45am Nicholas found a note in his room and a box. 'It told him not to go downstairs and he came and told me. After my father had said ""we will never be apart"" it was running in my mind.' Describing the moment he went downstairs, Mr Seager said: 'I saw the blood and thought dad has done something. I closed the door, because I didn’t want it to be the last image I saw of them.' Mrs Seager’s daughter, Susan Stirman, said her mother had begged to be allowed to return to the hospice because she would be more comfortable there. Return: Mrs Seager was due to return to St Francis Hospice in Romford, pictured, when she died . Ms Stirman told the court: 'She just said: ""You’ve got to get me out of here, I’ve not had a bath in two weeks.""' When it had been arranged to take Mrs Seager back to the hospice, Mrs Stirman went to visit her mother at home to tell her the news. She said: 'When I left, she just thanked me for arranging to move her into the hospice. 'She just touched my arm and said that she loved me. She then sort of put her thumbs up and said: ""See you in the morning.""' Asked what her mother’s state of mind was on the day, Mrs Stirman said: 'I would say she was happy.' When asked what her father's reaction to his wife moving back into the hospice was, she said: 'I didn't talk to him at all.' However, she did say that she heard him mention that they would 'never, ever be apart'. She told the hearing: 'I always knew my dad would be lost without my mum, but I didn’t think he would go to the extremes of what happened. 'If my mum died first, I had thought he may have killed himself.' She added: 'He was a bit like Jekyll and Hyde, you never knew what to expect, or whether he would be happy or not. He was a control freak.' She described her mum as a real family person, adding: 'She was most happy when she had all her family around her.' Eileen Tall, Mrs Seager's sister, told the court that she had received a phone call from Mr Seager just months before the couple’s deaths. She said he told her: 'I can’t see her in pain and I will kill her to put her out of the pain.' She added: 'Then he said that he shouldn't have told me that.' She confirmed to Coroner Nadia Persaud that Mr Seager has said he would kill himself if anything happened to Daphne. Dr Vinnie Nambisan, a consultant at the hospice, said he did not believe Mrs Seager would be able to kill herself with the weapons. The inquest continues.","Peter and Daphne Seager were found dead at home with wounds .

It's been 25 years since Spike Lee released his iconic film Do The Right Thing and around 25 years since President Obama and his wife Michelle Obama went to see that same film on their first date. In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Do the Right Thing, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held a screening, a reception, and a Q &A with Spike Lee, and a special surprise from The White House, reports Jezebel.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A former Alabama high school teacher and cheerleading coach accused of having an affair with a teenage boy was sentenced Thursday to five years in prison. In May, Jennifer McNeill, 39, pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree rape and one count of second-degree sodomy. McNeill said in court that she was sorry for what she had done, adding, ’I've lost so much... I've learned my lesson.’ Justice served: Jennifer McNeill, 39, a former teacher from Alabama, has been handed a five-year sentence for carrying on a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old boy . Authorities say the victim, a 14-year-old boy, was not a student at the school where McNeill worked. Prosecutors had dismissed some charges in exchange for McNeill's guilty plea. Judge John Bush, who handed down the sentence this morning, called the defendant's actions 'absolutely abhorrent,' adding that as a figure of authority she had betrayed the trust of the community, Al.com reported. The victim’s mother also spoke in court, saying that not a day goes by that her son does not pay for what happened between him and McNeill - a long-time family friend and a Sunday school teacher. The woman added that the teenager has been undergoing counseling to deal with the aftermath of the abuse he had endured at McNeill’s hands, according to the station WSFA. McNeill's sentencing was pushed back last month after a post was discovered on her Facebook account suggesting that she was innocent. Two weeks ago, McNeill’s attorney told the judge that her client denied writing the message and claimed that the victim and his relatives had access to her page. During sentencing Thursday, McNeill's lawyer apologized to the boy and his family, telling the court that her client had admitted to misrepresenting facts about the Facebook status update, which she penned. Scene: McNeill worked at Thorsby High School where she primarily taught . six graders and was also a sponsor for the cheerleading team. McNeill, a married sixth-grade teacher from Thorsby, was arrested last year and originally charged with six counts of rape and two counts of sodomy of a juvenile male - some of the alleged encounters took place on school grounds. McNeill's illicit romance with her friend's son lasted from April 2012 to June 2013, during which time the lovers had sexual intercourse at least six times and on two occasions engaged in oral sex. The 14-year-old claimed that one of their trysts took place in McNeill's classroom during the summer break, but the teacher has denied that. Sheriff Kevin Davis said in February that his office . began investigating allegations that McNeill was having sex with a minor after they got a call from the Department of Human Resources.","Jennifer Collins McNeill pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree rape and one count of sodomy .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Each August 9, socialite, fiction writer and former countess Ava Roosevelt pauses to thank fate for keeping her from the house of actress Sharon Tate on the night she was brutally murdered by the Manson Family. Roosevelt is convinced that if it weren't for a malfunction in her silver Rolls Royce and an early morning photo shoot that prevented her from attending Tate's party, she would have become Manson's sixth victim that fateful night. The former wife of a French count, Mia Farrow's brother, President Franklin Roosevelt's grandson and a steel heir sat down this week for an interview with the New York Post to talk about her brush with death on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the Manson massacre. Lucky: Ava Roosevelt, 66, a one-time model and author, has opened up about how she escaped being killed inside the home of Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski in August 1969 by the Manson sect . Life-saving malfunction: Roosevelt said a faulty gas gauge on her 1955 Rolls Roiyce Silver Down (similar to the one pictured) kept her from driving to Sharon Tate's party in Beverly Hills on August 9, 1969 . Roosevelt, who was close friends with director Roman Polanski and his wife, Sharon Tate, had been invited to the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills on August 9, 1969, just hours before Manson's cohorts descended on the house, slaying the heavily pregnant actress and four others. 'I've always said to myself how incredibly lucky I am,' she told the Post. Roosevelt, 66, was 19 years old at the time of the murders. She described the 26-year-old Tate as her 'older sister.' ‘The last words Sharon said to me were “I love you and come to see me. Try to come after dinner.” She sounded happy,’ Roosevelt recalled. Hollywood clique: Actress Sharon Tate, pictured in 1965 with her director husband Roman Polanski, was close friends with 19-year-old Roosevelt in 1969 . Tragic: Tate, whom Roosevelt described as her big sister, was stabbed to death 16 times by Manson's followers . But a faulty gas gauge on Roosevelt’s 1955 Rolls Royce Silver Dawn spoiled her plan to attend the gathering. The following morning, the 19-year-old model also had an early morning screen test for Alberto VO5 commercial, so Roosevelt decided to stay at home. What happened next inside the Polanski-Tate home has been well-documented: cult leader Charles Manson's followers entered the mansion and one by one slaughtered Tate, Vojtek Frykowski, Gibby Folger, Jay Sebring and Stephen Parent. The next day, the murderous gang dispatched businessman Leno La Bianca and his wife, Rosemary, in their Los Angeles home.

Madman: Charles Manson, pictured left in 1970 and right in 2009, has been convicted along with his followers in the cult killings of Tate and six others . Roman Polanski was away in London at the time of the murders. When he returned, Roosevelt said  the young husband and father-to-be was utterly devastated. ‘He was barely standing up. I have never seen anyone grieving like that,’ she recalled. Looking back on the notorious cult killings, Roosevelt said her very close call left her a changed woman. Ms Roosevelt has spent the past half-century traveling the world, with sojourns in Poland, Paris, New York and the Bahamas. Living life to the fullest: Roosevelt, pictured left and right with documentarian Wendy Lee, was the wife of a French count, a steel heir, Mia Farrow's brother and FDR's grandson; she traveled the world, got an education from the Sorbonne and wrote a novel in 2011 . She currently divides her time between Norfolk, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida. In 2011, the Sorbonne- and Columbia-educated ex-countess published a romantic thriller titled The Racing Heart about a supermodel who finds herself embroiled in a plot to kill the president to the United States.","Ava Roosevelt, 66, said she was invited by Sharon Tate to her Beverly Hills home on August 9, 1969, but could not come because of car troubles .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A Florida mother and her live-in boyfriend are facing a slew of child abuse charges after sheriff's officials say the man repeatedly molested his girlfriend’s children - and she did nothing to stop him. According to the Manatee County's Sheriff's Office, 42-year-old Shawn Ussery had not only sexually abused the minors for five years, but he also smoked methamphetamine with at least one of the victims. Ussery was arrested Tuesday at his home in Bradenton on 10 counts of sexual battery, 16 counts of capital sexual battery and a single count of aggravated child abuse. Shocking claims: Shawn Ussery (left) and his 37-year-old girlfriend (right) are facing a slew of charges in connection to sexual abuse involving the woman's children . His 37-year-old girlfriend, who is not being named by MailOnline to protect the identities of her children, is facing charges of child abuse, failure to protect the children, and lewd and lascivious exhibition. The couples' arrest reports cited by Sarasota Herald Tribune indicate that Shawn Ussery was taken into custody after law enforcement officials received a tip that the 42-year-old man had been abusing his girlfriend's children. When interviewed by officers, the kids confirmed that information and revealed that their mother has been aware of the molestation and did nothing to protect them from her boyfriend’s advances. The children claimed that instead of turning her boyfriend in to the authorities, the 37-year-old mother grew jealous and forced one of her children to watch as she performed oral sex on Ussery. MyFox Tampa Bay reported that the woman then allegedly declared in reference to Ussery: 'He was mine first.' Defenseless: The woman's children told sheriff's deputies that their mother (second left) knew about the sexual abuse and did nothing to shield them from Ussery . Sick: The girlfriend allegedly became jealous of her children and forced one of them to watch as she performed oral sex on Ussery (left) Besides the alleged sexual abuse, the children living in the household also have been exposed to drug use, with at least one of the kids allegedly smoking meth with Ussery as recently as three days before his arrest. The arrest reports state that a blood test later confirmed the presence of methamphetamine in the child's system. Online jail records show that Ussery has a lengthy criminal record encompassing more than a half dozen arrests on DUI, cocaine, theft and burglary charges dating back to at least the late 1990s. The couple are being held without bond at Manatee County Jail.","Shawn Ussery, 42, of Florida, charged with sexual battery and aggravated child abuse .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Police in Pasadena, California, are looking into claims that someone had hacked a high school teacher's email account and used it to send his nude photos to more than 200 people, including students. The message with the word 'Enjoy' in the subject line was sent July 10 containing four shirtless photographs depicting science teacher Richard Rosa. In two of the images, the man's privates were visible as well. Police investigating the incident do not believe that Rosa was the one who sent the email, which ended up in the electronic mailboxes of some of his colleagues, students and other Pasadena residents. Inappropriate content: An email containing nude photos of Pasadena teacher Richard Rosa (pictured) has been sent from his presumably hacked account to some 200 people . Sick prank: Among the recipients of the email titled 'Enjoy' were high school students and Rosa's colleagues . Cleared: Police have determined that Rosa was not the one who sent the images, among them shots of his private parts . The X-rated email sent from Mr Rosa's Pasadena Unified School District account prompted School Superintendent Jon Gundry to issue a written apology to the recipients, the station KTLA reported. ‘If you received this email, I would like to apologize for any harm this email might have caused and want to assure you that we are working with the relevant authorities to investigate the matter,’ he wrote. Educator: Rosa, a graduate of Michigan State University, has taught science at John Muir High School in Pasadena since 2007 . Richard Rosa has not been reprimanded by the school district in the aftermath of the incident. Still, John Muir student Devin Perry has preemptively launched a 'Save Mr Rosa' petition online, which so far has drawn 460 signatures. ‘Mr. Rosa is one of the most professional teachers I know and I would hate for a great teacher to lose a job based on a mistake that may have been an accident,’ Perry wrote. ‘He's taught me so much and I don't want a teacher who has impacted lives to be turned down because of a mistake.’ School district spokesman Adam Wolfson told Los Angeles Times that Rosa is not facing termination. According to his online biography, Richard Rose has been teaching science at John Muir High School since 2007. He is the science department chair and lead teacher of the high school's Business and Entrepreneurship Academy. Rosa graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Michigan State University and earned his Masters' degree in education from Cal Poly Pomona. Pasadena Police Commander John Perez told Pasadena Star News last week that Mr Rosa is not a suspect. So far, no one has been arrested in connection to the suspected hacking, but police say they have a few leads. Under California state law enacted last year, it is illegal to disseminate sexually explicit images belonging to someone else. If convicted, Richard Rosa's mystery hacker could face up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.

The bystander’s video shows the moment the 5-foot-7 bodybuilder dressed in a skimpy bathing suit was handcuffed by officers. ‘I've lived here since 1978 and I go to the beaches and I've never seen anything like this,’ the woman who made the incriminating video told MyFox. For Mr Caballero, Sunday’s arrest was not his first run-in with the law. The fitness trainer is a convicted felon who had served nearly eight years on cocaine trafficking charges.","Elissa Alvarez, 20, a waitress from Bradenton, Florida, and Jose 'Ben' Caballero, 39, charged with lewd and lascivious exhibition .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Chris Leadbeater . Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and a growing number of European air carriers have suspended service to Israel until further notice, citing reports that a rocket landed near Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport. A Delta Boeing 747 from New York was flying over the Mediterranean headed for Tel Aviv on Tuesday when it turned around and flew to Paris instead. Flight 468 had 273 passengers and 17 crew on board. 'Delta has suspended service until further notice to and from Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv and its New York-JFK hub,' the airline said in a statement posted on its official website Tuesday.

'Delta, in coordination with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, is doing so to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees.' Amanda Mel, a passenger aboard the diverted Delta Flight 468, told Ynet: 'We were told that the flight had been canceled without getting any explanation. 'Only hours later I saw the reports on the news and I understood,' said Ms Mel, who was trying to return home to Tel Aviv from New York. The passenger added that while the airlines' concern is understandable, she speculated that the decision to ban flights to Tel Aviv may have been a politically motivated move to help end the military operation in Gaza. US Airways, which has one daily flight from Philadelphia, canceled that flight Tuesday and the return trip from Tel Aviv, saying that it is monitoring the situation. United Airlines, which has two flights daily to Israel out of Newark, New Jersey, grounded these flights until further notice. American Airlines has told NBC News that the carrier is planning to hold a meeting shortly to discuss its service in and out of Israel. Early Tuesday afternoon, the FAA issued a ban prohibiting all American air carriers from operating flights to Israel 'for a period of up to 24 hours.' The notice came in response to a rocket strike which landed approximately one mile from Ben Gurion International Airport on the morning ... [and] applies only to U.S. operators, and has no authority over foreign airlines operating to or from the airport,' according to the statement. Major airlines have moved quickly to cancel services to Israel’s main air hub – Ben Gurion International in Tel Aviv – in light of yesterday’s attack, with saw a rocket land a mile from the airport. The incident comes at a time of heightened tension within the air industry following last week’s downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine by an apparent missile strike. The latest information is as follows: . America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a statement yesterday in response to the rocket attack, informing all American carriers that they are ‘prohibited from flying to or from Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport for a period of up to 24 hours… in response to a rocket attack which landed approximately one mile’ from the airport. The ban will run until 12:15 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) today – 5.15pm UK time – but may be extended for a further period. Delta re-routed yesterday’s Flight 468 – which had been due to land in Tel Aviv – to Paris. The airline has announced that it ‘has suspended service until further notice to and from Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv and its New York-JFK hub. Delta, in coordination with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, is doing so to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees.’ British Airways is still operating to Ben Gurion International. Its two daily flights to Tel Aviv from London Heathrow are still on the schedule. Its 08:50 service took off late, and is currently en route. Its 22:30 service is still due to depart as listed. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) says it ‘strongly recommends’ that airlines should avoid operating in and out of Tel Aviv. Easyjet has announced that it ‘is suspending its services to and from Tel Aviv for 24 hours, and, as a result, will not be operating Luton/Tel Aviv/Luton and Basel/Tel Aviv/Basel flights on Wednesday 23 July.’ Air France and KLM have suspended flights to Israel. A statement says that ‘Air France has decided to suspend flights to Tel Aviv until further notice. Air France's security department is closely monitoring local developments in real time. The safety of our passengers and our crews remains our top priority.’ Lufthansa, Germanwings and Austrian Airlines yesterday announced two-day suspensions of flights to Israel. Air Canada and Alitalia have cancelled flights to Israel. Grounded: A departure board at the Philadelphia International Airport shows a cancelled flight to Tel Aviv . Israel's Transport Ministry issued a statement insisting that Ben Gurion Airport was safe and well guarded . The agency said it will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation, and that updated instructions will be provided to U.S. airlines ""as soon as conditions permit, but no later than 24 hours"" from the time the directive went into force. Israeli Transport Minister Israel Katz responded to the FAA ban by insisting that there was no reason whatsoever for American air carriers to suspend service to Tel Aviv and 'hand terror a prize.' The agency called on the airlines to reverse their decision and added that the airport was 'safe for landings and departures.' Just after 1pm, Germany's Lufthansa, Swiss and Austrian airlines announced they are also suspending service to Ben-Gurion for 36 hours, followed by the Dutch KLM, Air France and Air Canada. But British Airways said that it will continue operating flights to Israel 'as normal' while monitoring the situation closely. The Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported that two rockets were intercepted Monday morning over the Shfela area, including Ben-Gurion International airport - Israeli's main flight hub. Target: The flight cancellations come a day after a rocket struck a house just 3 miles from Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv . Close call: Israeli rescue and military personnel at the wreckage of a home in the town of Yehud, outside Tel Aviv, and near the Ben Gurion Airport, that was hit by a missile fired by Palestinian militants from inside the Gaza Strip July 22 . A rocket also caused damage in the city of Yehud located only a mile from the airport. Police spokeswomen Luba Samri said the strike destroyed a house and slightly wounded one Israeli. Aviation and legal experts said Tuesday that airlines are now taking risk assessment into their own hands, both for the safety of passengers and to avoid claims of negligence. Aviation consultant Robert Mann said airlines are becoming more proactive in the wake of the Fligth 17 disaster. 'It's really forcing every carrier, every business jet operator to do their own due diligence, do their own risk assessment, given the geopolitical situation,' Mann said. Jonathan Reiter, a prominent New York aviation-accident attorney, said flying into an airport after a near-miss by a rocket could be used to show that the airline was negligent. That explains why airlines are suspending service to Israel. 'I'm sure it is human concern as well,' Reiter said, 'but I think [the airlines] feel it is wise to err on the side of caution because it is their burden to prove they are doing everything possible to avoid injuries and deaths.' Airlines and passengers are growing more anxious about safety since last week, when a Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Last Thursday, Delta released a statement saying that flights will no longer be routed through Ukrainian airspace 'out of an abundance of caution.'","Delta Flight 468 from New York to Tel Aviv carrying 273 passengers and 17 crew was rerouted to Paris Tuesday .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A woman who took part in a Pacific Northwest killing rampage fueled by white supremacist beliefs apologized for her actions, but not her views. Holly Grigsby, 27, was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison with no chance for release. She apologized in federal court to friends and relatives of the victims. Grigsby said she realized any explanation for her actions, such as her drug addiction, would come across as an excuse, 'or make it feel like I'm rationalizing my own insane behavior.' Closure: Holly Grigsby, left, pictured in 2011 looking at her boyfriend, David 'Joey' Pedersen, has been sentenced to life in prison for her role in a Pacific Northwest killing spree that authorities say was part of a white supremacist plot . Bloody path: Grigsby and Pedersen were arrested in 2011 following the deaths of four people: Pedersen's father and stepmother in Everett, Washington, an Oregon teenager and a California man . But Grigsby expressed no regret for white supremacist beliefs, only the effect her crimes would have on their public perception. 'My actions have further damaged the reputation of a movement misunderstood,' she said 'I deeply regret this. 'Although I had nothing but the best of intentions, the bridge to Valhalla is not paved with good intentions"" but with one's actions and heart,' she said, according to The Oregonian. Grigsby and her boyfriend — David 'Joey' Pedersen — were arrested in 2011 following the deaths of four people: Pedersen's father and stepmother in Everett, Washington, an Oregon teenager and a California man. Grigsby pleaded guilty in March to racketeering charges connected to the four killings, and the plea agreement called for a life sentence with no chance for release. Joey Pedersen has pleaded guilty to two counts of carjacking resulting in death — one for the death of teenager Cody Myers on the Oregon coast and the other for the killing of Reginald Clark in Eureka, California. Murdered family: Joey Pedersen's father, Red Pedersen (left), was shot in the back of the head, while his stepmother, Dee Dee (right), was slashed with dull knives and left to die from blood loss . Slain: Cody Myers, 19, was shot dead in Oregon when the couple thought he was Jewish, police said. They dumped his body in the woods and stole his car . He will be sentenced to life in prison at an August 4 hearing in federal court. He previously pleaded guilty in Washington state court to murder in the slayings of David 'Red' Pedersen and Leslie 'Dee Dee' Pedersen and was sentenced to life in prison. Dee Dee Pedersen's daughter, Lori Nemitz, told Grigsby in court that the murders were heinous and 'beyond cruel,' and made no sense since Grigsby had been welcomed into the home as family. 'I hugged you for God's sake,' Nemitz said. Pedersen is the founder of a white supremacist prison gang, and he told Grigsby about his desire to start a revolution with a killing rampage targeting Jewish leaders. Innocent bystander: The couple allegedly shot dead Reginald Clark, 53, in California after he offered them a ride, calling their victim a 'n***o degenerate' It started on September 26, 2011, when Joey Pedersen shot his father in the back of the head while the elder Pedersen was driving, authorities said. Red Pedersen moved and moaned for at least 30 minutes before dying, prosecutors said. Joey Pedersen believed that his father . deserved to die because he had allegedy molested one of his daughters, . rendering him a degenerate unworthy of the white race in his son's eyes, . according to court documents. 'Animals are treated more humanely going to slaughter than your victims were.' - Holly Perez, daughter of Red Pedersen . Pedersen and Grigsby returned to the house. Dee Dee Pedersen was bound with duct tape, slashed in the neck with a pair of dull knives and left to bleed to death. 'Animals are treated more humanely going to slaughter than your victims were,' said Holly Perez, the daughter of Red Pedersen and sister of Joey Pedersen. Catherine Hix, who spoke on behalf of another daughter, called Grigsby a ' wicked, heartless viper' who slithered into their town driven by the desire to 'murder.' The couple then drove Red Pedersen's vehicle south into Oregon, where they shot and killed 19-year-old Myers and stole his car, authorities said. They shot Myers, who was Christian, because his name sounded Jewish, according to court documents. Grigsby would later tell police they did not want any witnesses, and they regarded Myers as a 'casualty of war.' Pedersen and Grigsby then headed to Northern California, where Clark, a 53-year-old black man, was shot to death after he offered them a ride. The persecutors wrote in court documents  cited by The Oregonian that the pair viewed Clark not only as a potential witness who had to be neutralized, but also as a 'Negro degenerate.' Stopped: The couple was caught when a patrol officer saw them pulled over in October 2011 and asked if they needed help - before realizing the license plate was Cody Myers' Caught: David Pedersen, who has a plaster on his cheek and a turtleneck to hide his tattoos, is handcuffed by California Highway Patrol Officers in October 2011 . Nabbed: Holly Grigsby sits in the back of a police car following her killing rampage through Washington, Oregon and California with Pedersen . Grigsby and Pedersen were arrested October 5, 2011, outside Yuba City, California, when a police officer spotted them in Myers' car.  Grigsby told officers they were on their way to Sacramento to 'kill more Jews,' court documents said. Prosecutors said Grigsby has been a white supremacist since her age 13, and did not fall under Pedersen's spell. 'She is unflinching in her beliefs,' assistant U.S. attorneys Jane Shoemaker and Hannah Horsley wrote in their sentencing memorandum.","Holly Grigsby, 27, apologized for her actions in 2011 but expressed no regret for white supremacist beliefs she has held since age 13 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 13-year-old Texas girl has been arrested for allegedly posting messages on Facebook threatening to kill everyone in her town and terrorizing a young cancer survivor. The underage Splendora resident was picked up by police Sunday and charged with a third-degree felony in connection to online death threats posted on a fake social media account. As of Monday, the 13-year-old suspect was being held in a juvenile detention center pending a court-ordered mental evaluation. Scroll down for video . Caught: This 13-year-old girl seen on the day of her arrest Sunday has been charged with making terroristic threats on Facebook against the town of Splendora, Texas . Police in Montgomery County launched an investigation last Friday after getting reports from several concerned citizens in the town of 1,700 who had received disturbing messages from a Facebook account belonging to a Melissa Johnson. One of the online missives read: 'I am going to kill everyone in Splendora on July 13, 2014.' Using the bogus moniker, police say the 13-year-old suspect singled out Cristian Beasley, a 12-year-old classmate who suffers from leukemia. '[You] should have died,' one of the messages sent to Cristian read. The boy's mother, Amy Gaskamp, told the New York Daily News that before long, Cristian's friends were inundated with vile messages posted on his Facebook wall telling them to hang themselves. 'Go die with Cristian,' one post said. The threats made against the young cancer patient eventually led him to go into hiding with his father. Cristian, who is now cancer-free, made national headlines last year after Texas defensive player J.J. Watts paid him a surprise visit. Specific target: Some of the most vicious Facebook messages were addressed to Cristian Beasley, a 12-year-old cancer survivor who went to school with the suspect . Heartless: The 13-year-old allegedly wrote to Cristian, who is a leukemia patient, that he should have died . The football star learned from a news report that the boy had named a small robot he has been using in school ‘Watts’ and came to his house to spend a few hours with Cristian playing games. As news of the alarming cyber-bullying targeting the young cancer survivor and the rest of Splendora spread around town Friday, officials with Precinct 4 Constable's Office contacted Facebook requesting the company to reveal the true identity of the user behind the fake 'Melissa Johnson’ account, Click2Houston reported. At first, Facebook refused to comply, claiming that the menacing messages did not rise to the level of an urgent threat. Following  the release of a statement by the Texas law enforcement agency chastising Facebook for its 'incomprehensible lack of cooperation,' the site relented. Armed with information about the suspect’s identity and whereabouts, police officers tracked her down to the home of a family member in Harris County . According to police, the teen lives in Splendora and attends school in town. On Facebook, she pretended to be a 14-year-old model for the clothing store chain Hollister. In fear for his life: Amy Gaskamp (right), Cristian's mother, said the cyber-threats forced her son to go into hiding with his father . Disturbing: The teen's friends were inundated with mean Facebook massages from 'Melissa Johnson' telling them to 'go die with Cristian' Investigators have not named the girl due to her age, and there is no word on a possible motive. However, a message allegedly sent to Cristian Beasley's classmate suggested that the threats may have been made in retaliation for a slight the 13-year-old had suffered in the second grade. The 13-year-old's computers and electronic devices have been seized as evidence, but police have found no weapons in her possession. ‘There was no indication that she was actually making any preparations to carry out those threats,' the girl's attorney, Bill Pattillo, told Houston Chronicle. The lawyer described his young client as a good student who comes from a loving family. According to Pattillo, the teen has no history of drug use or criminal activity. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","The teenage suspect used fake persona of a 14-year-old Hollister model 'Melissa Johnson' to make threats on Facebook .

"By . Alex Greig . and Snejana Farberov . A Florida judge on Friday set a $150,000 bail for the release of a retired police captain charged with shooting dead a man for sending text messages in a movie theater, prompting a sharp rebuke from the victim's widow. Curtis Reeves Jr has been jailed since his arrest in January on a second-degree murder charge in connection to the killing of 43-year-old Chad Oulson. Reeves, 71, had been denied bail several times over the past six months. On his way out: Circuit Judge Pat Siracusa set a $150,000 bail for the release of former Tampa Police captain Curtis Reeves, Jr, seen here in court Wednesday, who is charged with fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole . Attorney T.J. Grimaldi representing Nicole Oulson, Chad's widow, decried the decision to set Reeves free. 'This is a dangerous man,' the lawyer told WFLA Friday. 'He does not need to be out of jail. Wouldn't you be nervous if a man . killed your loved one at a movie theater and then was let out of jail?' Speaking . to Bay News 9, Grimaldi said that Reeves will now get to spend time with . his family, whereas his client's family had been ripped apart. 'We are floored, we are devastated,' he added. On Friday, the Second District Court of Appeals ruled that Judge Pat Siracusa made an error by misinterpreting the law pertaining to conditional release. The judicial panel asked Siracusa to revisit his decision, giving him the option to keep Reeves behind bars so long as he can furnish an order laying out his reasoning. The circuit court judge opted to set bond for the defendant. Under the conditions of his release, which could come as early as Friday night, Reeves must surrender all his firearms and wear an ankle monitor, MyFox Tampa Bay reported. The former police captain is also forbidden from leaving his home except to go to church, to the grocery store, and to the doctor's office. Correcting an error: The Second District Court of Appeals ruled that Judge Pat Siracusa may have made a mistake by failing to set bail for Reeves since his arrest in January . In addition, the 71-year-old murder . suspect must have no contact with the victim’s wife who was also wounded . in the theater shooting. In . its decision, the appeals court stated that during a bond hearing in . January, Reeves made a compelling case for his release, adding that he . is an elderly man with no prior convictions. During a pre-trial hearing Wednesday, Curtis Reeves' defense team revealed they might use Florida’s controversial 'stand your ground' doctrine at trial next year. A trial date was expected to be set during the hearing, but defense attorneys said they were still in the midst of investigating the state's evidence, including 100 witnesses. Attorneys will meet September 10 to determine a trial date. Both sides have said they are not interested in a plea deal. ‘This is going to trial,’ Reeves’ attorney Richard Escobar said. ‘We're going to let the justice system decide this case.’ Reeves faces a minimum sentence of 25 years if convicted. Attorneys will discuss jury instructions, possible sequestration and media availability during an October 14 pretrial hearing. Nicole Oulsen says she has little movement in her hand and showed the scar from a gunshot blast on her left wrist after the hearing. Aftermath: This photo released by the attorney's office shows Curtis Reeves handcuffed in the movie theater where he shot Chad Oulson . Refused bail: Reeves, seen here at a February 5 bond hearing, was ordered to remain in prison until his trial . ‘We are definitely disappointed that . this will take an extended period,’ said T.J. Grimaldi. ‘It happened and . it happened for no reason... He was totally the aggressor and there's . no way around it.’ Transcripts . of jailhouse phone calls between murder suspect Curtis Reeves and his . family released in the spring revealed the retired Florida police . captain was confident of his acquittal. Other . evidence made public in April by the Pinellas-Pasco attorneys office, . including photographs taken from inside the Wesley Chapel movie theater . where Reeves shot dead Oulson and injured his wife over a text messaging dispute shed light on the case. Reeves, . 71, faces charges of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the . January 13 shooting. He is accused of gunning down husband and father Oulson and injuring his wife after the two men became involved in an argument over Oulson text messaging on his cell phone during previews for Lone Survivor at Grove Cobb 16 theater. 'When all the facts come out, we all should be in good shape,' Reeves told his family on January 16 - three days after the shooting, reports the Tampa Bay Times. In the recordings released by the Pasco-Pinellas State Attorney's Office, he tells his wife Vivian and his son and daughter to sell his motorbike or kayak if they are in need of money. Violent scene: A photo released as evidence shows the auditorium in the Grove Cobb 16 theater in Wesley Chapel after authorities say Curtis Reeves shot and killed Chad Oulson in a dispute over texting during previews January 13 . Sudden escalation: The confrontation that resulted in Oulson's death occurred before the movie had even begun . Armed: Reeves entered the theater with this gun, which he then used to shoot Oulson . 'You all need to know that you're all the love of my life. And if it need be, y'all plan on me not being there so you plan whatever you have to do to make your life easy, okay,' he said.  'My life will be easy if your all's is. Plan the future and don't spend all the money on me.' Photographs from the movie theater after the shooting show Curtis Reeves in handcuffs sitting in a theater seat, scattered popcorn, a dropped cell phone and a spent casing from the bullet that killed father-of-one Oulson. They also show Nicole Oulson's badly injured hand after she was shot trying to deflect the bullet that killed her husband. Video from the scene appears to show Oulson snatching Reeves' popcorn off his lap and throwing it at him. Reeves responds instantaneously with a single, fatal gunshot. No weapons allowed: The management forbids patrons to bring weapons into the theater . Life cut short: Chad Oulson, pictured with his wife and child, was killed during a confrontation with Reeves in January . Former cop: Reeves served as a Tampa police officer but is now in jail awaiting trial for murder . Reeves has claimed he shot the unarmed Oulson in self-defense because he feared for his life. 'Like I told everybody, I've spent 71 years doing the right thing and this guy just... anyway,' he said to his family over the phone.","Bail was set at $150,000 for the release of Curtis Reeves, 71, accused of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Chad Oulson, 43 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Two North Carolina men are facing the death penalty in the murder of a young volunteer firefighter last December - but the victim’s wife says she has already forgiven them. Jalend Turner, 19, and Khari McClelland, 23, have been charged with first-degree murder for allegedly gunning down 25-year-old Marcus Kauffman during a burglary at his Rowan County home in December 2013. Kauffman, who served on the Scotch Irish Volunteer Fire Department, was shot in the head and died three weeks later from his injuries at Carolinas Medical Center. Scroll down for video . Tragic couple: Marcus Kauffman, 25, pictured here with his newlywed wife, Maryann, was fatally shot last December after walking in on robbers ransacking his North Carolina home . 'Killers': Khari McClelland (left), 23, and Jalend Turner (right), 19, have been charged with first-degree murder and could face the death penalty . Marcus' wife, Maryann, was seven months pregnant at the time of the shooting. The slain firefighter passed away without getting to meet his son, Marcus Landon, who was born in February. On Friday, the Rowan County District Attorney’s Office announced that prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Turner and McClelland. The 24-year-old is believed to have fired the round that fatally injured Kauffman. Power of forgiveness: Maryann, who gave birth to her and Marcus' son in February - two months after his death - has asked the public not to hate her husband's murderers . District Attorney Brandy Cook said the murder trials of the two suspects will be tried as capital cases, reported Charlotte Observer. The pair's alleged accomplices, Tramel Hart, 18, and Michael Teasley, 25, were charged with accessory after the fact. Just hours after the announcement, Maryann Kauffman, Marcus' widow, wrote a comment on the news site WBTV in reaction to an article about the case, asking the public not to hate the men who allegedly killed her husband. ‘For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins,’ she quoted from Scripture, Matthew 6:14-15. ‘I don't see any exceptions in the bible depending on how terrible the sin is, or how much it hurts me,’ Mrs Kauffman went on. ‘Jesus forgave me, I can forgive them. ‘Thank you all for caring, but please don't feel hate towards them on our behalf. I don't want that, and Marcus wouldn't want that.’ Maryann, a devout Christian who met her husband in Bible camp, had said in the past that in her view, it was not the suspected burlglars’ plan to murder her husband. On December 2, 2013, Marcus 'Marco' Kauffman and his newlywed wife were coming back from spending Thanksgiving weekend with family when they spotted a suspicious blue car with its hood up near their home. Crime scene: The Kauffmans were returning from a Thanksgiving getaway when Marcus walked in on intruders ransacking their home in western Rowan County . So full of life: Marcus was a six-year veteran of a local volunteer fire department. The couple met at a Bible camp and got married in September 2012 . Kauffman drove up to the vehicle and asked the driver if he needed help, but the man sitting behind the wheel did not respond, according to a message posted on a Facebook page dedicated to the slain firefighter. Marcus took Maryann to a neighbor's home and then went back to check on their house on Chenault Road. Prosecutors said the 25-year-old father-to-be walked in on a group of robbers ransacking his home. Kauffman was able to dial 911 to report shots fired as he fled the house. Officers who arrived on the scene a short time later discovered Kauffman with a gunshot wound to the back of the head in his car, which crashed in the woods near a cornfield. The rear window was shot out. Officers were able to track down and apprehend Turner and McClelland a week later. Arrest warrants stated the intruders removed two computers, an Xbox and a gun from the Kauffmans’ residence.","Marcus 'Marco' Kauffman, 25, was shot in the head December 2, 2013, after interrupting a burglary in his home in Rowan County, North Carolina .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . A Mississippi girl born with the AIDS virus and in remission for years despite stopping treatment now shows signs that she still harbors HIV — and therefore is not cured. The news is a setback to hopes that very early treatment with powerful HIV drugs might reverse an infection that has seemed permanent once it takes hold. The girl is now nearly four years old. As recently as March, doctors had said that she seemed free of HIV despite not having been on AIDS drugs for about two years. That was a medical first. But on Thursday, doctors said tests last week showed that she is no longer in remission. She is now back on treatment and is responding well, doctors said. Scroll down for video . Major setback: A 4-year-old girl from Mississippi (not pictured) born with the AIDS virus and in remission for years despite stopping treatment now shows signs that she still has HIV . 'It felt very much like a punch to the gut,' Hannah Gay, the pediatric HIV specialist who has been treating the ailing baby, told Boston Globe. The news is 'obviously disappointing' and may have implications for a federal study that had been about to start testing early, aggressive treatment in such cases, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 'We're going to take a good hard look at the study and see if it needs any modifications,' either in terms of length and type of treatment or because of ethical concerns over raising false hopes about an approach that now has suffered a setback, Fauci said. Most HIV-infected moms in the U.S. get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies. The Mississippi baby's mom received no prenatal care and her HIV was discovered during labor. Because of the baby's great risk of . infection, doctors started her on unusually powerful treatment 30 hours . after birth, even before tests could determine whether she was indeed . infected. The girl was . treated until she was 18 months old, when doctors lost contact with her. Ten months later when she returned, they could find no sign of . infection even though the mom had stopped giving her AIDS medicines. Crushing disappointment: Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi who has been treating the little girl, said hearing the news of her setback felt like a punch to the stomach . Tests repeatedly showed no detectable HIV until last week, when copies of the virus were measured in her blood. Doctors say they don't know why the virus rebounded when it did, and said it raises profound questions about what they know about HIV's hideouts in the body. Silver lining: Dr. Deborah Persaud, a pediatric HIV expert at Johns Hopkins' Children's Center in Baltimore, said the fact that the little girl remained off AIDS drugs for as long as she did is unprecedented . But some researchers in the HIV field remain optimistic. 'The fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented,' Deborah Persaud, professor of infectious diseases at the John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore, told USA Today. In March, doctors revealed that a second baby born with HIV may have had her infection put into remission by very early treatment — in this case, four hours after her birth in suburban Los Angeles in April 2013. Nearly a year later, very sophisticated tests at multiple times suggested she had completely cleared the virus, but she remains on treatment so there is no way to know for sure. Only one other person is thought to have been cured of HIV infection — Timothy Ray Brown, from San Francisco, who had a bone marrow transplant in Germany back in 2007 from a donor with natural resistance to HIV. He showed no sign of infection more than five years later.","The Mississippi girl, now 4 years old, was thought to be free of HIV despite being off AIDS drugs for two years .

'Our city is inspired by his courage and deeply saddened by his loss.' Real-life hero: Lt Ambelas was a 14-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department who only recently was honored for saving the life of a seven-year-old boy . That theme was poignantly accentuated when fire helmets from Ambelas’ old commands were placed on the heads of his daughters Gabriella, 8, and Giavanna, 5. While ‘no one feels it more than the family that has suffered this loss,’ said the mayor, ‘all members of the FDNY - but really, all New Yorkers - are feeling this moment with pain and sadness, because we’ve lost a true hero.’ Ambelas had been promoted to lieutenant 10 months ago. Throughout his career he helped the city through its darkest hours, including the recovery from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and Superstorm Sandy. 'Matt was the best of the best,' firefighter and friend Eric Bischoff  told 7Online. 'He died a hero - that's how he lived.' Firefighters from Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis were among those who traveled great distances to salute Ameblas’ casket. It was lowered from a caisson draped . in a department flag and taken into a Staten Island church by . pallbearers, followed by his wife, Nanette, and their little girls.

Refering to her oldest daughter, Gabriella, she said the 8-year-old girl made the most sense of what happened, promising the mother to take care of her now that her hero dad was gone. Following the funeral service held at St Clare's Church, the firefighters were lined up for miles as he was transported for a private burial. Ambelas is the 1,444th New York City firefighter to die in the line of duty since the department’s founding in 1865.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Filmmaker James Marcus Haney traveled to Seattle last month to make a music video for the British band Bear's Den and spend time with his college-age brother and his friends, but their final days before graduation were marred by a deadly campus shooting. On June 5, former janitor Aaron Ybarra, 26, walked into Seattle Pacific University and opened fire, killing one student and wounding two others, according to police. Making the video took a backseat to mourning, but Haney’s brother and his circle decided to take part in it anyway as a special way to honor the victims. Scroll down for video . Drama: The music video for the song 'Elysium' by Bear's Den shot last month in Seattle captured the moment Seattle Pacific University students learned that a one of their own was gunned down on campus . Raw emotions; Director James Marcus Haney captured moments of grief for the music video starring his brother and his friends . In a first-person account written for NPR, Haney explained that the idea was to use his brother and his classmates in the music video for the song ‘Elysium’ as a way to explore their transition from childhood into adulthood. ‘I wanted to film him and his real friends doing actual things that they normally do,’ Haney writes. ‘I wanted to document the actions and emotions of people at this age — the highs, the lows, the noteworthy and the mundane.’ The beautifully shot mini-movie, which was released Tuesday on the band's official YouTube channel, begins with snippets from the lives of kids in their 20s enjoying their last days before leaving the protective bubble of college life. Turner Haney, James' brother, and his friends are seen drinking beer, kissing, getting inked in a basement, riding a bike with careless abandon and fishing off a pier. Power of music: Haney wrote that at first, the music video took a backseat to the mourning, but then his brother's friends started listening to 'Elysium' and decided to finish the project . Tribute: In the video, one of the young man wears a sweatshirt honoring the victim, Paul Lee, who loved to dance . The youths standing on the brink of adulthood appear optimistic, filled with joy and a sense of their invincibility. But in the course filming, the tight-knit Seattle Pacific University community was shaken to the core by gun violence. In . the 'Elysium' video, Haney shows the moment students learn of the . tragedy from a breaking news report on TV while attending a house party.

Initially, . the name of the slain student was not released, but as hours ticked . off, one young man from a room on the same floor as Turner Haney . remained unaccounted for. One . of the missing student’s dorm-mates spent the night sleeping in the . hallway outside the elevator waiting for him, and others soon joined . him. But they were all waiting in vain. In the morning, it was confirmed that Turner Haney's friend and dorm-mate, 19-year-old freshman Paul Lee, had been shot dead. Ode to youth: The song 'Elysium' talks about the fleeting beauty of youth and the pain associated with growing up . Reckless abandon: Haney's goal was to preserve some of the remnants of his younger brother's innocence before he stepped into adulthood .

In . his essay, James Haney recalls that the music video became a last . priority for him amid the heartbreak, and all his thoughts were with his . grieving brother. But . then something strange happened: Turner and his friends started . obsessively listing to 'Elysium,' playing the track over and over again. The . melancholy songs about the fleeting nature and beauty of youth includes . the words: 'Brother don't grow up.... /Just hope that age does not . erase all that you've seen/Don't let bitterness become you/Your only . hopes are within you.'

Turner and his group of friends decided to help his brother finish the video in honor of their slain friend. In a particularly poignant moment that comes towards the end of the clip, one of the students is seen depositing a maroon sweatshirt with the words 'Dance Paul' - a reference to Lee's passion for dancing - at a makeshift memorial on campus.

"By . Stephanie Linning . Victim: 26-year-old Jamie McMahon was killed in an unprovoked attack as he sat on a bench in a churchyard in Northampton last October . Two thugs have been jailed for life after battering a man to death in a vicious attack that was so frenzied they left a footprint on his face. Mark Lewis, 20, and Michael Francis, 33, were 'on a mission to steal and rob' on the night they targetted Jamie McMahon, 26, in an mindless attack last October, the court heard. The two men stole just £30 from their victim, who they left bloodied and bruised in a churchyard in Northampton after beating him to death. Mr McMahon had enjoyed a night playing snooker with friends on when he stopped for something to eat on the way home. He sat down to eat his kebab on a bench outside St Giles' Church, in Northampton, when he was approached by his killers shortly after 2am. A court heard Mr McMahon was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' after being violently attacked by the pair who were 'on a mission to steal and rob'. They beat up and kicked the snooker hall worker in the head so brutally that they fractured his eye socket and left a trainer imprint on his face. The pair then took the victim's wallet, which contained £20, and his iPhone which they sold for £10. They spent some of the stolen money on tobacco, soft drinks, jam sandwiches, crisps, milk and sugar shortly after the vicious attack. On Friday the pair were given a combined sentence of 46 years at Northampton Crown Court. Francis, who was found guilty of murder and robbery, will serve a minimum of 26 years in prison. Lewis, who admitted the same charges, was sentenced to a minimum jail term of 20 years and eight months. Sentencing Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'Mr McMahon was subject to a sustained attack. He was a popular man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'You carried no weapon but you knew where vulnerable people would be and you were prepared to use severe violence. 'No sentence will bring him back and he will be sorely missed by his family and friends. He did nothing to deserve what happened to him. Killers: The court heard that murders Michael Francis, left, and Mark Lewis, right, were 'on a mission to steal and rob' on the night they killed Mr McMahon last year. The pair were sentenced to a total 46 years in jail . 'The spontaneous attack was vicious, rapid and mindless.' The court heard that Francis claimed Lewis had threatened him to keep quiet but Judge Mayo said it was 'inconceivable'. He said Francis was not 'in awe or fear of Lewis,' because of his actions in helping to conceal any evidence after the attack, including swapping clothing with his friend. During the trial, which finished on July 10, the court heard that Jamie had been sitting on a bench in the churchyard when he was attacked. A pathologist had concluded that the head injuries would have left him unconscious and he would have died within an hour of the attack. Scene of the crime: Jamie McMahon was murdered as he sat eating a kebab on a bench in front of St Giles' Church in Northampton, pictured. The judge described the attack as vicious, rapid and mindless . CCTV cameras tracked the thugs on their walk home as they stopped at a BP garage. Representing Francis, Jonas Harkin told the court that Lewis was the only one proven to have kicked and stamped on the victim. But Judge Mayo said he believed Francis became directly involved in the violent attack. Amjad Malis, defending Lewis, said his client had 'exploded into violence', which was linked to suffering a childhood of abuse at the hands of his grandmother, who was his main carer after his father committed suicide. He also said that Lewis had been involved in two previous violent robberies. A psychologist's report said he is a person likely to respond disproportionately to confrontation. Lewis was also given five concurrent years for robbery and Francis was given eight years for the same charge. After the case Detective Inspector Louise Hemingway, from Northamptonshire Police, said she hoped the sentences handed down would help the family come to terms with their loss.She said: 'We are pleased with the significant jail terms handed down to Lewis and Francis today. 'They are both extremely dangerous individuals who targeted a young man who was on his way home from an evening out with friends for no other reason than to steal from him. 'Hopefully these lengthy prison sentences will provide some closure to Jamie's family who have been left heartbroken by this senseless murder.'","Jamie McMahon, 26, was beaten to death in the violent attack last October .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A San Diego-based clothing company has landed in hot water over a photo showing its T-shirts featuring the body of a monkey paired off with a customized hanger depicting the face of an African-American boy. The offensive image was shared on Twitter Wednesday, sparking indignation among users who lambasted the manufacturer, Just Add A Kid, for allowing this to happen. The clothing brand, which is owned by the company Thanks A Million, quickly went into damage control mode, responding on Twitter that the incident was the result of a misunderstanding. Bad idea: The clothing brand Just Add A Kid has come under fire after this image appeared on Twitter showing their T-shirts with a monkey design paired with hangers depicting an African-American boy . 'The widely distributed and inappropriate picture of a mismatched ""Just Add A Kid"" hanger with one of our t-shirt products was not authorized, condoned or tolerated by our company,' spokesperson David Oates wrote in a statement released on Twitter. 'We sincerely regretted this occurrence and immediately directed our retail partner to change the product placement.' The statement went on to say that the company will offer mandatory training to everyone in their distribution channels to make sure that such an incident never repeats itself. The image that set off the controversy depicted a row of Just Add A Kid tees with the body of a monkey holding a banana, draped over cardboard hangers with the face of an African-American child. Damage control: The San Diego manufacturer responded to the outrage by tweeting a collage of all the different designs they offer paired with hangers depicting kids of various races . The monkey shirts were placed next to a row of tees with a soldier character on the front, which had been matched with hangers featuring a Caucasian boy. The company explained the T-shirts and hooks came separately, and it was up to each individual store carrying the Just Add A Kid brand to match the two. 'The head shots on our hangers are intended to reflect the different cultures of our happy customers,' the spokesman for the company wrote. Just Add A Kid's statement went on to explain that one of their retailers paired a particular hanger with a shirt without consideration for how it may appear. Just Add A Kid offers a wide range of products ranging from baby bibs to onesies, toddler tees and shirts for adults ranging in price from $9.95 to $17.95. For all ages: The monkey design is featured on different items, from bibs to T-shirts for adults . Finger of blame: The company claimed that the store that matched the hangers with the monkey shirts did so no realizing that customers might by upset . Questionable: Besides the monkey design, the Just Add A Kid site also offers products featuring a 'Confederate' character (right) in a Civil War uniform of the South with a rebel flag . The clothing items come with many different designs, including farmers, princesses, zoo animals, pirates and basketball players. ‘Our designs feature multicultural skin tones and appropriately matching header cards (to) showcase children of the world,’ the company tweeted. The message was accompanied by a collage showcasing various shirt models matched with hangers depicting African-American, Hispanic and Asian toddlers. Among the cartoon characters that grace the shirts available for purchase on the Just Add A Kid website is one called 'Confederate,' which depicts a Civil War-era rebel in a grey uniform with a drawn sword and a small Confederate flag.","San Diego-based company Just Add A Kid released a statement claiming a retailer paired off the shirts with the wrong hangers .

"By . Stephanie Linning . 'Devious conman': Paul Gaffney, 51, scammed 18 elderly victims - including his own next door neighbour - out of £105,000 . A rogue trader who conned elderly residents out of more than £105,000 has been jailed for nine years. Paul Gaffney, 51, approached vulnerable residents on their doorsteps, offering his services as a home repairman and contractor. But Gaffney, who the judge described as a 'devious conman', would leave jobs half-finished or poorly done and then accompany his elderly victims to the bank to make sure that he was paid. A year-long investigation found that the father-of-three from Cosham, Hampshire, scammed a total of 18 residents - including his own elderly next door neighbour - during his crime spree, which started in March 2012. Some of Gaffney's victims applauded as he was sentenced to nine years in jail at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Judge Sarah Munro QC said that Gaffney used his 'charm' and 'good character' to trick a 'very significant number of vulnerable and elderly, some very elderly, people'. One victim, retired architect Peter Bolt, 85, handed over £35,000 for work which was never carried out at his home in Southsea, Hampshire. The court heard that in April 2014, while already on bail bail for 18 charges of fraud, Gaffney drove Mr Bolt to his bank to withdraw money to pay for a job that Gaffney had promised to do. But quick-thinking bank staff called the police and officers were waiting for Gaffney when he turned up at Mr Bolt’s home the next day. Mr Bolt said: 'I was shocked when the police came round to see me. None of the work had been done but I had faith in him that he would do it. 'But, when I added it all up, I realised I had given him a huge amount of money. 'When you hear he had conned so many people in such an awful way, and deprived people of their life savings and probably caused them nervous breakdowns, I’m very relieved he’s got such a large sentence.Hopefully he will never ever do such things again.' Gaffney would offer to fix electrics, boilers, windows and roofs despite having only painting and decorating qualifications - and even returned to some of his victims more than once. An 80-year-old widower from Cosham was also conned out of £24,000 for work to his roof. The great-grandfather blames himself for recommending Gaffney to a female friend in Southsea who handed over £1,500 for work that was never done. He said: 'I was in the forces and I have seen terrible things but nothing has affected me this badly. Victim: Retired architect Peter Bolt, 85, handed over £35,000 for work which was never carried out at his home in Southsea, Hampshire. He said that he hoped Gaffney will 'never do such things again' 'Really, I am responsible for what happened to my friend too. I can’t sleep more than four hours a night.' His friend, an 81-year-old widow, said Gaffney haunts her dreams to this day. 'I have nightmares where he is in my house, I run for help, come back and he has cleared everything out. It took a lot of time and money to get my visa to visit my granddaughter in America and he took that too. 'Now I don’t have the confidence to go over there. The thing is, he was so plausible. At Christmas he gave us a huge piece of Christmas cake because he said we were good customers.' The court heard the crime spree began in March 2012 when Gaffney approached next door neighbour Terry Roberts. Deceitful: Sentencing Gaffney at Portsmouth Crown Court, pictured, Judge Sarah Munro QC said that the fraudster used his 'charm' and 'good character' to trick a 'significant number of vulnerable and elderly people' Gaffney said he was having some work done on his roof and if they both had it done together it would work out cheaper. Mr Roberts, who is elderly and suffers ill-health, agreed and handed over more than £3,000. He had scaffolding at the front of his house for more than a year. Meanwhile, Gaffney had taken a large chunk out of the roof, exposing it to the elements. Mr Roberts and his wife had to spend their life savings putting it right. In his defence, barrister Paul Barton said Gaffney, a married father-of-three, had an addiction to betting machines. 'A case such as this instils in the public feelings of horror, disgust and fear - and rightly so' - Judge Sarah Munro QC . Earlier this month he made a full admission of his guilt but Judge Sarah Munro QC was scathing in her sentencing. She said: 'A case such as this instils in the public feelings of horror, disgust and fear - and rightly so. 'Your only qualification is as a painter and decorator. However you are a plausible and devious conman and used your charm and your good character to trick a very significant number of vulnerable and elderly, some very elderly, people. 'Many of them are retired professionals and many of them expressed their surprise they were duped by you despite their own intelligence and backgrounds.' She said Gaffney’s neighbour, Mr Roberts, had suffered a ‘year of hell’ and added: 'Some of your victims were in their 90s with ill health and disabled. 'You deprived them of their hard-earned sums of money.' Gaffney pleaded guilty to a total of 20 fraud related charges.","Paul Gaffney, 51, approached vulnerable residents on their doorsteps .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Auctioneers in London were left stunned when a buyer spent £500,000 on three garages - even though the lot came without planning permission. For the same staggering amount, the owner could have bought a sprawling country retreat or even a fleet of luxury sports cars. But the winning bid could prove to be a bargain if planning permission is granted for the site in Wandsworth, south-west London, where a semi-detached home can sell for £1.46 million. Scroll down for video . Sought after: The garages, which have parking at the front and are built on the side of a semi-detached family home, could be worth more than £1million if it is developed into another semi-detached property . Bidding war: The three garages in south-west London, pictured, were listed at a guide price of £130,000 but sold for £500,000 - three times the average house price in England and Wales . The row of garages on Blenkarne Road near Wandsworth . Common, were offered at a guide price of  £130,000 . when they were put up for sale on Tuesday. But there was so much interest in the site that the . first bid came in at £175,000 when the lot went under the hammer at . Barnard Marcus Auction in London. Investors in the saleroom and on the phone battled it out for the freehold garages, which have parking at the front and are built on the side of a semi-detached family home. The winning bidder ended up paying £500,000 for the three garages - almost three times the average price paid for a home in England and Wales last month. With the money spent on the sought-after garages, the owner could have bought Moreton House, a 28-bedroom Grade II listed manor house in Devon which went on the market at £500,000 earlier this month. It also could have bought five luxury Porsche 911 Targas, which cost around £98,000 each. Sprawling: Grade II listed Moreton House in Devon went on sale for £500,000 earlier this month. As well as 28 bedrooms, the property boasts 19 reception rooms, an impressive ballroom and eight bathrooms .

One estate agent called the bid a 'shrewd' investment . In the catalogue issued for the sale, Barnard Marcus Auctions said the garages 'may be considered suitable for redevelopment or reuse'. However, there is currently no planning permission, making the £370,000 premium all the more extraordinary. Chris Glenn, divisional managing director for Barnard Marcus, said: 'This again demonstrates the benefits of auction disposal to our clients.' If the unnamed buyer does manage to get planning permission, then their speculative punt could pay off. Rightmove says the average price of a . home in Wandsworth is £640,000, with a terraced property costing . £905,000. A semi in the area costs £1.46 million. Luxury drive: For the same eye-watering amount, the new owner of the three garages could have bought five Porsche 911s, pictured. The price could prove a bargain if the owner is granted planning permission . Henry Pryor, a property buying agent, today described the purchase as 'shrewd'. He said: 'I am not surprised to hear the price. The conversion of garages into homes is very much in vogue at the moment. 'The Mayor's office have identified hundred of sites which could be used to solve the capital's housing crisis. I expect these garages will turn out to be a shrewd place for the buyer to park their money.' The three garages in Wandsworth is the latest big-figure sale of a lock-up in the capital. In May, an investor bought a row of six garages in Parsons Green in the south-West of the city which were offered with no planning permission for £700,000 - ten times the estimate price. And in April, a former coach house in Camberwell, which was used to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold for £550,000.","The row of garages in south-west London had a guide price of £130,000 .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A vet who was filmed having sex with a horse and a dog has been banned from practising in the UK. Oliver Fraser Lown of Kesgrave, Suffolk, was found guilty of five charges by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) disciplinary committee at a hearing at their London headquarters. Videos were found in his possession showing him engaging in sexual activity with animals, as were 'extreme' pornographic images of animals and people, the RCVS heard. Struck off: Oliver Fraser Lown, who was identified in a video partly by a green star shaped tattoo on his leg as the person 'engaging in sexual activity with a horse in a stable setting and a dog in a house setting' Lown, believed to be in his 20s, had . already been taken to court in 2012 after being found with 'extreme' pornography involving . people and animals. The RCVS heard that in addition to the porn . offences, for which he was given a conditional discharge, he also . engaged in sexual activity himself with a horse and a dog and then . boasted about it online. 'Extreme' images: Oliver Fraser Lown. The RCVS heard how he boasted about his sexual activity with a horse and a dog online . According to the findings, he pleaded guilty at Northallerton and Richmond Magistrates Court in North Yorkshire to seven criminal charges in 2011 relating to the possession of extreme images involving people and animals. The RCVS committee heard the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him in respect of a bestiality charge that it was considering, but the RCVS found the charge to be proven. Lown had graduated from the Szent Istvan University in Budapest, Hungary and he had been registered with the RCVS in 2013, the committee heard. The RCVS said he never practised in Britain. Lown did not attend the RCVS hearing in London, but he was represented by a solicitor. Three of the charges related to the discovery of images or videos on a laptop and a mobile phone at his home near Ipswich. Another charge related to footage of him engaging in sexual activity with a horse and a dog, while a fifth charge related to him sending messages that referred to sexual activity with animals. The video shows Lown 'engaging in sexual activity with a horse in a stable setting and a dog in a house setting', and he was partly identified by a distinctive green star tattoo on his leg. Delivering the findings, Professor Noreen Burrows, Chair of the Disciplinary Committee, said: 'The committee has no doubt the conduct was of the utmost seriousness, the material found in his possession and his own conduct involved the abuse of animals and a total lack of respect for their welfare.' Disgusted: Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons office in London, where the disciplinary hearing took place. Their findings concluded that Lown's behaviour with regards to animals amounted to 'disgraceful conduct' She said: 'In the judgement of the . committee, each of the charges individually amounts to disgraceful . conduct and the charges certainly amount to disgraceful conduct when . taken cumulatively.' The findings sate that: 'The Committee has no doubt that the only way in which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded, public confidence maintained and proper standards of conduct upheld is by directing the Registrar to remove the Respondent’s name from the Register.'","Oliver Fraser Lown was found guilty of five charges by Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A science fan who made explosive devices after being inspired by the hit television show Brainiac has been jailed for six months after leaving a bomb in his garden shed for seven years. Michael Thomas, 40, was part of a group of friends who made six pipe bombs before taking them to a remote quarry in Corsham, Wiltshire, to detonate in 2006. One of the devices was blown up inside a microwave in a re-enactment of an experiment on the popular Sky One show, which has been presented by Richard Hammond and comedian Vic Reeves. However, the group forgot to detonate one of the pipe bombs and it was unwittingly carried home in a sports bag by Thomas, who placed it in his garden shed following the outing. Michael Thomas, 40, was jailed for six months at Bristol Crown Court after admitting making an explosive substance. An unexploded pipe bomb made by the father of two was found in his shed in August last year . Thomas had made the devices with friends after being inspired by hit television show Brainiac. However, he mistakenly left one pipe bomb in his garden shed (above) which caused a street evacuation when it was found . Bristol Crown Court heard how the device was eventually discovered by Thomas' ex-wife - who he separated from  in 2010 - after she decided to clear out the shed on August 17 last year. Police were called when the woman, who was not named in court proceedings, spotted a copper pipe and green cord poking out from the sports bag. Eighty homes close to the shed, described as being in a ‘built-up area’ in Warmley, Bristol, were evacuated for five hours while an Army bomb disposal squad used a robotic device to examine the bag. It was then taken to a remote location nearby and safely detonated, while concerned residents took shelter in a nearby supermarket. Thomas, who is now in a new relationship and the father of two young children, was arrested and admitted a charge of making an explosive substance. Judge Michael Roach told the stock controller that those ‘reckless enough’ to build such devices - despite not having a sinister motive - should go to prison. ‘The consequence of that discovery were sufficient not only to excite the police but also the bomb squad,’ the judge said. The father of two had taken the pipe bombs in a sports bag to a quarry in Corsham, Wiltshire for detonating but unwittingly left one in the bag. After putting it in his shed  in 2006, the bomb was discovered seven years later . Police and an Army bomb disposal unit were sent to the house formerly occupied by Thomas in Warmley, Bristol, (above) in August last year when his ex-wife discovered the unexploded device in the garden shed . ‘A street had to be evacuated and people had to be looked after at a nearby supermarket. There’s no doubt at all that this is a serious offence. On any view you were enormously reckless. ‘I accept that there was no sinister purpose of that device but the potential for it being on a street, unguarded, available in a residential area makes it obvious that the risks were significant. ‘I can’t ignore those risks.’ Nicholas O’Brien, prosecuting, said Thomas lived with his ex-wife in Bristol until 2010 when the couple separated. ‘In August 2013 his wife decided to clear out the shed where she needed some space,’ Mr O’Brien said. ‘She found a sports bag and having opened it she saw a number of pellets and a copper pipe, with green cord poking out the end.’ Thomas was arrested on August 18 last year and officers who searched his computer discovered material relating to making explosives, Mr O’Brien added. The court heard how the group made the explosive devices and blew them up in a quarry in a re-enactment of an experiment on the popular Sky One show Brainiac, which has been presented by Richard Hammond (above) ‘It is serious and dangerous but really it seems to be a rather juvenile, amateur interest in explosives,’ he said. Sam Jones, defending, said Thomas - who has since moved to Bridgwater, Somerset - was a hard-working family man with two children, aged two and 10 months. Mr Jones said Thomas made the devices with a group of friends, before taking them to a quarry in Corsham to detonate. ‘One was set off inside a microwave, inspired by a programme called Brainiac,’ Mr Jones said. ‘At the end of the programme, which focused on science, various experiments were carried out in things like microwaves. It was used in an educational way. ‘That was really the catalyst for what followed.’ Mr Jones said one of the devices made a ‘loud bang’ when it was blown up, but the others simply fizzed and smoked. Thomas, who wore a smart black suit for today’s hearing, was jailed for six months for the offence. As he was led to the cells, the judge told him: ‘What a sad day for your family.’","Michael Thomas, 40, was part of a group of friends who made six pipe bombs .

"By . Associated Press . A Navy investigation finds the ailing skipper of a San Diego-based Navy cruiser retreated to his cabin for several weeks in the middle of a deployment, leaving the 330-member crew leaderless. The probe also revealed that the skipper of the USS Cowpens, Captain Gregory W. Gombert, was having an improper and 'unduly familiar' relationship with the cruiser's acting executive officer, U-T San Diego reported Wednesday. The Navy removed Gombert and the ship's command master chief, Master Chief Petty Officer Gabriel J. Keeton, from their positions on June 10. The reason given at the time was poor ship condition. Removed: Captain Gregory Gombert was relieved from his position in June after an investigation found he left his crew leaderless and had an improper relationship with a female crew member . Improper: Destiny Savage was often in her captain's cabin with the door closed where she cooked him meals and left her clothing and toiletries . Gombert's medical problems were not disclosed, but investigators said they should not have left him unable to lead. They also shouldn't have required him to retreat to his cabin from early January through March, officials said. 'The violations revealed by the investigation, especially the blatant abdication of command responsibility on the part of the (commanding officer), are among the most egregious I have encountered in my 32-year career,' wrote Vice Admiral Tom Copeman, the three-star admiral in charge of the Navy's Pacific surface ships. At a July 25 administrative hearing, Gombert was found guilty of several counts of disobeying an order and conduct unbecoming an officer. So was the former acting executive officer, whom the newspaper identified in a Navy photo from March as Lt. Cmdr. Destiny Savage. Leaderless: Captain Gregory Gombert left 330 crew on the USS Cowpens without a leader when he took to his cabin from early January to March . Neither Gombert nor Savage could immediately be reached for comment Thursday. Keeton was found guilty of two counts of disobeying an order, apparently because he failed to notify anyone outside the ship of the troubles on board — despite telling crew members that he would. The investigation found the skipper's unacceptable absence from the bridge predated his illness. Of the 48 'special evolutions' that the ship performed — tricky maneuvers such as getting close to a refueling ship — Gombert was on the bridge for just 27, according to U-T San Diego. His health-related seclusion began in mid-January, when he came down with an illness that required bed rest for 10 to 20 days, according to the investigation. Disgraced: Captain Gregory Gombert, commanding officer of Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Cowpens (CG 63), Lt. Cmdr. Destiny Savage, Cowpens' executive officer, Cowpens' Command Master Chief Gabriel Keeton . Poor condition: Gabriel Keeton was also dismissed from his position as command master chief . Gombert told his superiors that he questioned his ability to lead on two of those days and later said he considered asking for convalescent time, but decided against it. As for Gombert's relationship with Savage, the newspaper reported that starting in December, the crew noticed the two officers spent evenings alone in Gombert's cabin, with the door closed. Savage frequently was seen making dinner for Gombert in his cabin and keeping her toiletries in his private bathroom there, according to investigators. Also, the investigation said, the two went away for days together during port visits.","A Navy investigation has found Captain Gregory Gombert retreated to his cabin from January to March during a deployment .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Measuring 40ft high and riddled with rats and flies, this is the scene that greets residents of one suburban road every single morning. Made up of compacted rubbish, this mountain is laden with everything imaginable from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges to tyres, scrap metal, excrement, discarded nappies and plastic bottles. It has blighted the lives of residents living in Cornwall Drive in Bromley, south-east London for nearly five years – and shows no sign of being moved, despite the fact it set on fire again this week for the umpteenth time. Scroll down for video . Residents of Cornwall Drive in Bromley, south-east London have lived in the shadow of this mountain of rubbish for five years – and there's no sign of it being moved . Firefighters have been keeping constant watch at the 40ft high site as the 25,000 tonne of rubbish keeps self-igniting in the heat and continues to smoulder away . Steam can often be seen coming from the top of the rubbish mountain as fire from within smoulders away, creating a putrid stench of burning plastic for local residents . Alan Cowburn, 74, who has lived on the road for 50 years, is praying for a time when the rubbish tip is shifted – but in the meantime he is forced to live with the putrid stench of rotting litter, the foot-long rats which roam freely and the plague of flies. On top of that, he is forced to watch it smoulder away constantly as it continues to self-ignite in the warm summer heat. ‘The fire brigade have been here all day and night and they could be here all weekend, it’s a top priority fire risk,’ he said. In fact, since 2011, London Fire Brigade has sent more than 650 fire engines to more than two dozen separate fires on the site. This represents more than 2,250 working hours and more than £650,000 in fire-fighting resources. ‘It’s costing the taxpayer a lot of money,’ said Mr Cowburn. ‘It’s a hazard because it keeps catching alight and the fire service has to come out constantly to check on it. ‘The trouble is it keeps self-igniting in the heat and it just sits there smouldering away.’ The mountain of garbage has been a massive problem for Mr Cowburn and his neighbours since rubbish disposal company Waste4Fuel took over the site in 2011. Since 2011, London Fire Brigade has sent more than 650 fire engines to more than two dozen separate fires on the site - at a cost of more than £650,000 in resources . The mountain is laden with everything imaginable from rotting industrial waste, old shoes and broken fridges to tyres, scrap metal, excrement and discarded nappies . Firefighters continue to stand watch at the site on a daily basis and repeatedly hose it down to ensure the smouldering rubbish tip doesn’t escalate into a full-blown fire . According to its website, the firm’s aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it ‘specialises in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be reprocessed for use in generating electricity.’ It charges people to dump rubbish at the site — day and night, which it sorts, treats and then sends on for disposal elsewhere. However, residents say this doesn’t happen and instead, over the past couple of years, Waste4Fuel has just taken the money and let it stack up in a monstrous putrid mountain. ‘It’s an absolute nightmare’, said Mr Cowburn. ‘This used to be a quiet little cul-de-sac, lovely and green and a pleasure to live in but now there’s a nasty smell as soon as you open the front door, flies and rats. ‘We’re living here under terrible conditions. We’re stuck with this huge problem and nobody wants to take any notice or do anything about it. ‘We need someone to come and ship it all out, but no one seems to be stepping up to do the job.’ Mr Cowburn reckons it will cost £2million and require a fleet of lorries to shift the 25,000 tonne of rubbish. However, an ongoing dispute between Waste4Fuel, the Environment Agency and the High Court means the rubbish is unlikely to be moved any time soon. Firefighters and officers are required to visit the south-east London site three times a day for the foreseeable future to monitor the rubbish and carry out security checks . The rubbish has attracted rats to the area and is plagued by flies meaning residents cannot open their windows, relax in their gardens or keep their cars clean of dust . The location of a waste or recycling plant is the responsibility of the local authority, which in this case is Bromley Council. But its size and scope is set out in the operating permit granted by the Environment Agency, which allows Waste4Fuel to use the site ‘as a waste transfer station processing general non-hazardous waste, from commercial operators with [a maximum] of 5,500 tonnes allowed at any time.’ Last November, the agency won a court order for Waste4Fuel to clear the site of combustible waste by the end of April. But the firm said it could only afford to comply by generating more money — by allowing more waste to be brought on site — and applied to increase the amount of rubbish it handles from 75 to 200 tonnes a week. It ended up failing to comply with the order. The Environment Agency then tried to seek contempt charges against the recycling company, former company director Bryan Hughes, new company director Shelley Hurst and site manager Jonathan Beckson. The charges were in relation to Waste4Fuel not complying with an undertaking to install appropriate fire breaks and separate areas for new waste at the site. However, earlier this month the High Court dismissed the case – a decision which the agency is now deciding whether to appeal. An Environment Agency spokesman said: ‘We fully understand and share the frustration of local residents and are doing everything we can to deal with the problems that Waste4Fuel have created. Alan Cowburn, 74, who has lived on the road for 50 years,  is forced to live with the putrid stench of rotting litter, the foot-long rats which roam freely and the plague of flies . ‘We’ve used a range of approaches to make Waste4Fuel clean up the site. The site operators have avoided their responsibilities over many months and failed to comply with notices and a mandatory court order to remove the waste by 1 May 2014. ‘Waste crime blights people's lives. We will not give up.’ The Court recognised that those responsible have broken the law, but decided not to send them to prison. We’ll read the judgment carefully before deciding whether to appeal against that decision. ‘Since the hearing we’ve already served a further enforcement notice to stop Waste4Fuel from bringing any further waste on to the site and this appears to be working. ‘We are also considering what further steps we can take to make the operators remove the waste. ‘It is the operator’s and then the landowner’s responsibility to clear up the site. It is not the responsibility of public bodies unless there is an immediate risk to the public. ‘Our environment officers are visiting the site regularly and we will continue that close scrutiny working in partnership with the Fire Service, Health and Safety Executive and Local Authority to work to find a solution.’ The new enforcement notice means that any person depositing waste at Waste4Fuel will be committing an offence and may face further action from the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency has issued an enforcement notice to site owners Waste4Fuel to stop the firm dumping any more waste at the already overcrowded site . Earlier this month, the High Court dismissed a case against Waste4Fuel which had been brought by the Environment Agency which was seeking contempt charges . Failure to comply with the new enforcement notice will result in further regulatory action being taken and several conditions within the new enforcement notice need to be met before further waste can be accepted at the site. Andrew Pearce, Environment Agency Area Manager for Kent and South London, said: ‘This enforcement notice is another step towards the Environment Agency bringing the Waste4Fuel site back into compliance. ‘The High Court Order we secured last year has not been complied with, and waste on site is slowly increasing. ‘We understand the frustration of local residents and are doing everything within our power to bring the site back into compliance as soon as possible.’ In the meantime, firefighters continue to stand watch at the site on a daily basis to ensure the smouldering tip doesn’t escalate to a full-blown landfill fire. In addition, officers are required to visit three times a day for the foreseeable future to monitor the rubbish and make security checks. MailOnline has been unable to contact Waste4Fuel representatives for comment.","The 40ft high pile of rubbish, which is also 60ft wide, towers above a residential street in Bromley, south-east London .

It is believed the former Hamas Gaza prime minister’s home was empty at the time of the attack and no casualties have been reported. Haniyeh's son Abdel Salam said  missiles had hit the house, which is believed to be situated on the outskirts of Gaza City, twice. In a statement, he said: 'The Israeli enemy struck our house twice.' The attack came as Hamas revealed its media stations Al-Aqsa TV and Al-Aqsa Radio had also been targeted. The television station continued to broadcast, but the radio station went silent as the building became engulfed in flames. Scroll down for video .

An investigation has been launched after the man fell ill on the first night of the two-day event at Long Marston airfield near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. Police said the man was taken from the festival site to Warwick Hospital at about 11pm last night but was pronounced dead at 1am after attempts to save him failed. The man fell ill at the Global Gathering festival site near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire and was taken to hospital but died in the early hours of this morning. Pictured: Festival-goers watch BBC Radio 1Xtra's Mistajam . More than 50,000 revellers have descended on dance music festival Global Gathering this weekend to see the likes of Chase & Status, Tinie Tempah and Katy B perform. Pictured: Campers at the Long Marston airfield site . A force spokesman said his death is currently being treated as unexplained. Post-mortem tests are expected to be carried out in due course to determine the cause and exact circumstances surrounding the death. The man's family have been informed. More than 50,000 festival-goers have descended on Global Gathering this weekend to see the likes of Prodigy, Tinie Tempah, Sub Focus and Katy B perform. It is thought the man became unwell while headliners Chase & Status took to the main stage and David Guetta performed on a nearby smaller stage last night. A spokesman for Global Gathering said staff were assisting police with their investigation. Police have been warning festival-goers (above) to drink plenty of water so as not to get dehydrated in the heat .

"By . Emma Glanfield . The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has launched his mobile marshmallow picture-printing business in a top London department store with the help of a reconditioned tricycle. James Middleton was revealed earlier this year as the man behind Boomf on Demand (BOD) – a unique business which allows Instagram pictures to be printed onto square marshmallows. Today, he revealed the business had gone ‘mobile’ when he unveiled an ‘on-the-go printing machine’ in the form of a repurposed tricycle. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge's brother, James Middleton, is the man behind Boomf on Demand (BOD) - a unique business which allows Instagram pictures to be printed onto square marshmallows . The business has now gone 'mobile' with an 'on-the-go printing machine' in the form of a re-purposed tricycle. To celebrate the launch of Boomf on Demand, Mr Middleton and his team took the retro bike to Selfridges . The machine allows photos to be printed onto marshmallows instantly, before they are sold as a box for £12 . The machine allows images to be printed onto marshmallows instantly in store, before they are sold as a box of nine for £12. It means members of the public can give the business their favourite images before watching them be transferred onto the tasty treats, ready for eating. The Boomf brand was launched by Mint Digital towards the end of last year, but James Middleton’s involvement was only revealed in January. The entrepreneur, who cycled across the U.S with his sister Pippa last month for Race Across America 2014, teamed up with Mint Digital chief creative officer Andy Bell for the latest venture. Speaking in a tongue-in-cheek manner at the launch of the ‘mobile Boomf’ today, Mr Bell described how the pair successfully transferred the tricycle idea into a reality. He said: ‘For many months, deep in the Berkshire countryside, a man dreamed of a tricycle that could create personalised marshmallows at the touch of a button. Many scoffed at his vision. Some said it couldn’t be done. The Boomf brand was launched by Mint Digital towards the end of last year, but James Middleton¿s (above) involvement was only revealed in January . The retro tricycle used as Boomf's 'on-the-go machine' was assembled using items mostly from eBay . The Boomf bike was created in just four days and taken to Selfridges on Oxford Street, central London today . Customers can give Boomf their favourite images before watching them be transferred onto marshmallows via the 'Willy Wonka-style' printing machine . ‘Luckily this was the 21st century and eBay had been invented. Every obscure part needed to assemble this vision could be tracked down using a technique known as “searching the web”. ‘Dyslexic super-powers allowed combinations of parts to be imagined in multiple dimensions as an entirely novel contraption. Few could understand this vision or why so many parts needed to be bought on eBay. ‘The machine had to be ready in four days. It was in incredible rush but, as luck would have it, the man in the Berkshire countryside was a boyhood fan of Scrapheap Challenge, and liked nothing more than a tinkering challenge against a fast approaching deadline.’ The ‘man in the Berkshire countryside’ is of course reference to Mr Middleton, who grew up in the county with Kate before she went on to marry Prince William. James Middleton, who cycled across the U.S with his sister Pippa last month for Race Across America 2014, teamed up with Mint Digital chief creative officer Andy Bell for the latest venture . Mr Middleton said that the most enjoyable part of creating the product was coming up with its name, Boomf . Now uncle to Prince George, the businessman is hoping to make a profit from his latest venture, which comes after he failed to make a profit with his cake and bread company for a second year. Accounts filed earlier this year revealed how Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £21,148 for the 12 months to March 2013. It means the company, which was set up in April 2011 by Mr Middleton, is yet to post a profit, having lost £19,928 in its first year of trading. The company also owes creditors £35,951.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Andrew Williams (pictured outside Leeds Crown Court today)  was handed a 12-month supervision order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work . A Mayor who pocketed £220 in takings from an ice cream truck during his town’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations has been spared jail. Andrew Williams, 44, was wearing his official chain as Mayor of Ripon, North Yorkshire, when he was handed the money by an ice cream seller who meant for it to be passed on to the council. However, instead of passing the money on to Ripon City Council, Williams - who was depending on payday loans and had a gambling problem - took it for himself. The offence, which occurred during a Diamond Jubilee event in Ripon in June 2012, came to light when the council’s accounting committee noticed the money had not been paid. Williams was found guilty of fraud by a jury at York Crown Court in June and sentenced at Leeds Crown Court today. Judge Guy Kearl QC said Williams had brought disgrace on his office and said the most appropriate sentence was for him to work in the community he deprived. He said: ‘It is the fact you were Mayor of the city at the time which is of greatest significance because you were trusted to look after people’s money. ‘What you did is unforgivable. ‘You have brought disgrace on the position you occupied and you have eroded the confidence of the public in the position of Mayor of Ripon.’ The court was told that in return for selling ice cream at the Jubilee event, John Taylor of Harrogate-based C&M Ices had agreed to hand over 20 to 25 per cent of his takings to the council. At the end of the day, he owed £220 and put it in a bag which he later handed over to Williams. However, Williams fraudulently kept the money for himself having racked up a number of payday loans and gambling debts. Prosecutors told how Williams, who was then chief executive for a law firm, was estimated to have lost around £31,000 through gambling and had borrowed around £14,000 in loans. However, Alasdair Campbell, representing Williams, disputed he had lost as much through gambling as the prosecution claimed and argued he had since sought help for it. He said as a result of the case, Williams had lost not only his job but another as a credit controller for an asbestos removal company when there was publicity about his conviction. He also did not seek re-election for Harrogate Borough Council or for North Yorkshire Council but chose to remain a councillor at Ripon until next year to save the cost of a by-election. The judge handed Williams a 12-month supervision order to address his gambling problem and ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work. The money taken by Williams has since been repaid to the council by an anonymous person.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Inmate riots and a fire broke out at a prison when prisoners were told they were not allowed outside during hot weather. Up to 60 prisoners took over a wing of HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire after the riot broke out at about 12.30pm yesterday. The fire was reportedly started during the ongoing incident which kicked-off after the inmates refused to return to their cells. Up to 60 prisoners took over a wing of HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire after a riot broke out at 12.30pm . A spokesman for the Prison Service said some damage was sustained but there were no injuries to staff or prisoners. Glyn Travis, assistant secretary of the POA, described the disturbance as a 'serious incident' and said the prisoners refused to return to their cells before taking control of a unit. Mr Travis added that the inmates started a fire which was quickly put under control. However, the disturbance continued until about 8pm last night. Police, ambulance and fire crews attended the prison, which is on a country road a few miles outside Retford. Officers carrying shields and other equipment were seen going inside, later joined by around 15 firefighters in their full kit. Officers and police both arrived at the prison yesterday afternoon to help try and bring the riot under control . Although the fire was quickly brought under control by fire crews, the riot continued until about 8.10pm . Several prisoner-carrying vehicles went into the prison to collect a number of inmates, who could be heard shouting and banging as they were driven away. It is thought specialist prison guards - similar to riot police – were deployed to the category C training prison and staff on weekend leave were called back to work to help with negotiations. A prison spokesman said: 'A disturbance on one wing at HMP Ranby has ended. No . staff or prisoners were injured and minimal damage was sustained. 'Prison staff were deployed to deal with the incident, which involved between 30 and 60 prisoners. 'The prison will now return to normal operation and visits will take place as usual.' Prison staff are now working with Nottinghamshire Police to identify the ringleaders . Nick Hardwick, chief inspector of prisons, said HMP Ranby was already ‘in crisis’ after the publication of a report on Thursday which described the prison as unsafe with high levels of violence. The critical report of HMP Ranby was released following an 11-day inspection by HM Inspectorate of Prisons. The fire started during the ongoing disturbance which broke out when prisoners were not allowed outside during hot weather. It comes just days after a critical report of HMP Ranby (above) was published . It is thought specialist prison guards - similar to riot police – were deployed to the category C training prison to help get the situation under control (file picture) It found that two prisoners died through ‘self-inflicted deaths’ last year, and a further two have died in a similar way since the unannounced inspection in March. Conditions in part of the prison, which holds more than 1,000 men, were dirty, prisoners were found to have climbed netting in a bid to force a transfer to another facility and nearly half the population said they had felt unsafe having been victimised or intimidated, findings showed. Evidence was found of an increasing number of incidences of self-harm at the prison, and the availability of legal highs was also found to have increased. Labour MP John Mann, whose Bassetlaw constituency includes the prison, said his repeated warnings that ‘dysfunctional' management and serious staff shortages would lead to disaster had been ignored by ministers and prison officials. He said there were 80 fewer prison officers than previously - a 20% reduction - with many experienced individuals having been ""forced out"" over the past two years. ‘It is a prison where, for quite a time, it's been clear prisoners have been running the prison,’ he said. ‘There are not the numbers or the expertise among the staff to deal with it. ‘The governors were warned, the Government was warned, by me and by many others, that this would lead to disaster. ‘I have raised this directly with the prisons minister more than once.’ He welcomed the appointment of a new governor but said he had ‘lost track’ of how many changes there had been at the top and insisted the only solution was to recruit more staff. Mr Travis said today's disturbance was ‘no surprise’ to the POA. ‘It's all down to chronic staff shortfalls and a management that are hell-bent on delivering things they can't deliver safely,’ he said. ‘Prisoners are saying 'We're not dealing with this'. ‘They will react.’","Up to 60 prisoners took over a wing of HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Warm weather is forecast across Britain today meaning continuous sunshine could be on the way for the next 40 days – if British folklore is to be believed. Many will welcome the fact the Met Office is forecasting bright sunshine and temperatures of 25C, as superstition states that if the sun shines on July 15, it will continue to do so for the next 40 days. However, the St Swithun’s Day folklore also states that if it rains today, it will continue to do so for 40 days – although most of Britain doesn’t have to worry as forecasters say there is a ‘very slim chance’ of scattered showers across the country today. Temperatures were expected to reach 25C across many parts of the country yesterday before soaring to the late twenties on Thursday and Friday making Britain hotter than some European holiday destinations including Ibiza, Nice and Barcelona. Pictured: Eight-year-old Poppy Mae Priest relaxes in the sun at Bournemouth this afternoon . Pictured: Charlotte Finch, six, makes a splash at Bournemouth beach . Temperatures could rise to a sweltering 30C in many parts of the country on Thursday and Friday, including in the south east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the UK over the next few days. Sun-seekers enjoyed the sunshine in Bournemouth today, including Talia Jade Rahl, one (left), and Charlotte Finch, six (right) Despite experts warning yesterday that . rain could dampen St Swithun’s Day, forecasters today said temperatures . would soar to 25C and continue rising towards the weekend. Most . places across the UK will remain fine and dry today, including in . Manchester, Birmingham, London, Newcastle and Exeter - where the chance . of rain is less than five per cent. Met . Office forecaster Dan Williams said there was a ‘very low possibility’ of rain today, and said as a whole the UK would see ‘mostly dry’ conditions with ‘plenty of cloud around but sunny spells’. Wednesday also looks promising, with the bulk of England and Wales likely to remain dry and sunny. It . will herald the start of another hot spell in Britain, where . temperatures could exceed those in popular European holiday destinations . such as Barcelona, Ibiza and Nice. Temperatures . will start to rise from Thursday, peaking on Friday when the 30C . barrier could be reached for the first time this year, with the most . likely location somewhere to the north-west of London. Heather Welby, of Portishead, (left) and Gaye Senior-Smith (right), of Bristol, enjoy the sun on St Swithun's Day in the University of Bristol Botanic Garden . Forecasters say there is is a 'very good chance' the hottest day of the year so far could be surpassed by Friday. The hottest day of 2014 so far was July 4, when 28.7C (83.7F) was detected in Norfolk and Essex. Pictured: One lady cycles past cattle on Midsummer Common in Cambridge, where the sun peeped through the grey clouds . However, the balmy conditions towards the end of the week – which could see the hottest day of the year so far surpassed – could bring ‘thundery’ rain. Mr Williams said there was a chance heavy showers could develop in parts of the UK on Thursday before it clears later in the afternoon. However, despite the blip, temperatures are expected to rise to a sweltering 30C in many parts of the country on Thursday and Friday, including in the south east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the UK over the next few days. Mr Williams said there was a very good chance the hottest day of the year so far could be surpassed by Friday. The hottest day of 2014 so far was July 4, when 28.7C (83.7F) was detected in Norfolk and Essex. However, despite the ‘hot and humid’ weather, forecasters have warned the conditions could be uncomfortable for some as it will feel muggy instead of fresh. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said ‘thundery downpours’ could give brief respite from the hot and sticky weather on Friday and Saturday. She said: ‘Most people won't enjoy these conditions. It can be difficult sleeping during the hot humid nights. ‘Although it probably is shorts and T-shirt weather, you will need a brolly at the same time.’ Many will be relieved it stayed dry  to coincide with the folklore of St Swithun's Day. While legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country will be in for 40 days of sun. Pictured: Ellie Wimshurt, 22, wanders through Barley Wood Walled Garden in Somerset . Despite the 'hot and humid' weather over the next few days, forecasters have warned the conditions could be uncomfortable for some people as it will feel muggy and sticky instead of fresh. Pictured: Ken Roberts cuts daisies at Somerset Flower Farm in Wrington, Somerset where temperatures reached up to 25C today . The conditions, which should ease when a band of fresher air sweeps in on Sunday, are not expected to trigger the Met Office's official threshold for a heatwave. For those looking forward to the next wave of warm weather, many will be relieved that it is expected to stay dry today to coincide with the folklore of St Swithun’s Day. While the legend states that rain on July 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days, it also says that if it remains dry for the day, the country will be in for 40 days of sunshine. The British folklore dates back to c.800, when St Swithun was a Saxon bishop at Winchester Cathedral. As he lay on his deathbed he asked to be buried outside where he would be trodden on and rained on. His wishes were followed for nine years, then on July 15, 971, the monks of Winchester attempted to remove his remains to a shrine inside the cathedral. This week's warm weather heralds the start of another hot spell in Britain, where temperatures could exceed those in popular European holiday destinations such as Barcelona, Ibiza and Nice. Pictured: A man enjoys a walk through Midsummer Common in Cambridge this afternoon as the sun makes a break through the clouds . According to legend, the removal was accompanied by ferocious and violent rain storms which lasted 40 days and nights and were said to indicate the saint's displeasure at being moved. The story soon became British folklore and ever since the weather patterns on July 15 have been closely followed by the superstitious. The folklore’s rhyme reads: 'St Swithin’s day if thou dost rain, For 40 days it will remain. St Swithin’s day if thou be fair, For 40 days ’twill rain no more.' However, the Met Office has routinely said there is no ‘scientific evidence’ supporting the folklore and said numerous studies have been carried out on past weather observations, with none proving the legend to be true. It also said that since the start of records in 1861, there has been neither 40 dry or 40 wet days following the corresponding weather on St Swithun's Day. While it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for the next 40, there is some element of truth to weather patterns continuing. By this point in the summer, the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of August. The jet stream is a fast-flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere. It tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the south. If it is sitting to the north of the UK, then warm air tends to invade from the south, usually associated with high pressure building in from the Azores, leading to fine and settled weather for the British Isles. However, should the jet stream sit across the UK or to the south, then cooler air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across the country from the Atlantic, leading to unsettled weather. So far, the jet stream is pointing directly towards the British Isles, indicating unsettled weather.","British folklore states that if conditions are fair on St Swithun's Day then the sun will continue to shine for 40 days .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A man who took his girlfriend out for dinner to apologise after an argument choked to death on a piece of steak in front of her, an inquest heard. Alan Lobban, 61, had taken his partner Glenys Ashmead, 62, out for a pub meal following a row at his flat in Gloucester. However, the evening turned to tragedy when the former hairdresser started choking after taking just ‘two or three mouthfuls’ of meat. Alan Lobban, 61, (left) had taken his partner Glenys Ashmead, 62, (right) out for a meal at The Fountain Inn pub in Gloucester, to apologise for a row when he choked to death on his steak after taking just a few mouthfuls . The inquest into his death, at Gloucester Coroner’s Office, heard how Mr Lobban was ‘too drunk’ to cough up the steak meat and ‘keeled over’ in front of his horrified partner and other diners at The Fountain Inn, Gloucester. He was pronounced dead by paramedics at the pub on March 29 last year. Ms Ashmead, who had known Mr Lobban for just 12 months, told today’s inquest: ‘We were at his flat when we had an argument. I left and Alan came after me and said we should go for a meal. ‘Between 9pm and 9.30pm our food arrived. Alan had taken two or three mouthfuls when he started vomiting and keeled over.’ A post mortem examination found Mr Lobban had ‘significant’ levels of ethanol in his system when he died. Recording the cause of death as accidental, Coroner Katie Skerrett said: ‘It is unlikely he was able to chew meat properly. Speaking after the inquest, Glenys Ashmead, from Gloucester, said: 'Alan's death was such a shock to me, I'm still trying to come to terms with it. The way he went was so sudden, it was such a terrible tragedy' The tragic incident occurred at The Fountain Inn pub in Gloucester (pictured) on March 29 last year . ‘He was trying to swallow pieces of meat while he was heavily intoxicated which affects the ability to cough.’ A pathologist’s report said there was a heavy smell of alcohol coming from his body, and recorded 242 milligrammes of alcohol in his blood. Speaking after the inquest, Ms Ashmead, from Gloucester, said: ‘Alan’s death was such a shock to me, I’m still trying to come to terms with it. ‘The way he went was so sudden, it was such a terrible tragedy. He was loved by everyone who knew him.’","Alan Lobban took partner Glenys Ashmead out for dinner after an argument .

"By . Emma Glanfield . The BBC has banned the use of electronic cigarettes in all of its offices and studios around the country, it has emerged. The blanket ban came into force this week after months of confusion at the Corporation, according to sources. It means e-cigarette users now have to go outside to designated smoking areas to use their product - which are seen by some as a healthy alternative to tobacco cigarettes. The Corporation has banned e-cigarettes from all of its offices and studios including at New Broadcasting House in London (pictured) and at BBC North's Salford Quays headquarters in Manchester . Regional managers were previously free to either allow or outlaw the use of ‘vapers’ indoors. A ban was brought in at BBC North's Salford Quays headquarters in Manchester, while e-smoking was tolerated at New Broadcasting House in London. But now Corporation chiefs have confirmed the ban has spread across the BBC. A BBC spokesperson said: 'In line with advice from the British Medical Association the BBC has introduced a ban on the use of e-cigarettes in BBC buildings.’ The BBC is following in the footsteps of a number of large UK employers, including insurer Standard Life. The company banned its 5,500 employees from using e-cigarettes inside its buildings two years ago. Machinery firm JCB has also outlawed ‘vaping’ in the workplace, while a number of local authorities including Newcastle and Stoke-on-Trent are looking at bans. E-cigarettes are not covered by the legislation which brought in a blanket ban for tobacco smoking in public places and workplaces. E-cigarettes, many of which contain nicotine, are seen by some as a healthy alternative to smoking . Their use has already been banned in public places in several U.S. cities including New York and Chicago, while France is looking at bringing in similar restrictions. E-cigarettes, many of which contain nicotine, are seen by some as a healthy alternative to smoking. But others claim that they are ‘renormalising’ smoking and actually encourage people, including teenagers, to take up tobacco. A Public Heath England report concluded that electronic cigarettes offer ‘vast potential health benefits’ by providing a ‘safer source of nicotine’ for smokers. It added: ‘But maximising those benefits while minimising harms and risks to society requires appropriate regulation, careful monitoring, and risk management. ‘However the opportunity to harness this potential into public health policy, complementing existing comprehensive tobacco control policies, should not be missed.’ Electronic cigarettes have trebled in popularity over the past two years and more than two million people in the UK now regularly use them (file picture) WHAT ARE E-CIGARETTES? E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices with an atomiser and replaceable cartridge. The cartridge contains nicotine in a solution of either propylene glycol, or glycerine and water which can be flavoured. As the user inhales, the battery heats up the liquid inside the cartridge and produces a vapour which delivers a hit of nicotine. Toxins are at trace levels and comparable to nicotine replacement therapies. One cartridge is the equivalent of up to 25 cigarettes and the battery lasts between two  and five hours before it needs recharging. Electronic cigarettes have trebled in popularity over the past two years and more than two million Britons now regularly use them - up from an estimated 700,000 in 2012. However, of these, two-thirds also smoke normal cigarettes, while the rest are mostly ex-smokers. WHAT IS THE LAW ON E-CIGS? In June last year, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced that it would regulate e-cigarettes and other nicotine containing products (NCPs) as medicines. The legislation, which is in line with regulation proposed within the European Commission’s draft Tobacco Products Directive, is expected to be adopted in 2014 and will come into force in 2016. The MHRA announced the new legislation after the government concluded . that e-cigarettes currently on the market did not meet appropriate . standards of safety, quality and efficiency. It means that licensed products will be available over the medicine counter, in the same way painkillers and cough remedies are. As it stands in the United Kingdom, the use, sale and advertising of e-cigarettes are legal and are not covered by national smoking bans. They are currently available to anyone over the age of 18, after the government brought forward legislation to make the purchase of them illegal to under 18s at the beginning of the year. In some countries, electronic cigarettes have been banned from public spaces, including in Brazil, Norway and Singapore as well as the states of New York and Chicago in the US. France is also looking at bringing in a similar ban. In other countries, such as New Zealand, electronic cigarettes are regulated as medicines and can only be purchased in pharmacies and in some places, including Canada, Denmark and Australia, they are subject to restrictions on sale, import and marketing.","BBC has enforced blanket ban on use of electronic cigarettes in its offices .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Three people were left bloodied and bruised after being hit in the face by flying golf balls in separate incidents on the first day of The Open – with one unlucky marshal being hit twice within the space of an hour. One spectator - a man believed to be in his 60s – had to be taken to hospital after apparently being left injured and covered in blood when a shot by Ernie Els struck him in the face. It came just a short time before a similar incident involving triple Open champion Tiger Woods, whose shot on the 17th hole was caught on camera smacking a course marshal in the face. Scroll down for video . Footage emerged of a shot by Tiger Woods (above) apparently hitting a marshal at Royal Liverpool in the face . A Tiger Woods shot on the 17th hole appeared to hit a marshal in the face as he stood patrolling the course . Video footage appeared to show the course marshal (right) being hit in the face by the flying golf ball . And, in further calamity, another course marshal was hit twice by flying golf balls as he patrolled the 16th hole. He . was left lying on the ground after a shot by Rickie Fowler hit his leg . and, after getting up, he was struck again within 45 minutes by a shot . from Charl Schwartzel. All of the incidents occurred yesterday on the opening day of the golf championships at Royal Liverpool in Merseyside. South . African double Open champion Els, who later took to Twitter to . apologise for his shot, said his ball would have hit the spectator ‘like . a bullet’. It was the first shot of the tournament for 44-year-old Els and veered to the left into the crowd of fans. In . the aftermath of the incident, he said: ‘It's obviously a dangerous . shot and I hit the guy, who was probably in his 60s, right in the face . and there was blood everywhere. ‘I . felt pretty bad about it. I probably should have told the starter to . move the people left on the left side, but I didn't do that. Ernie Els (pictured above at The Open yesterday) offered championship tickets to the spectator who was struck in the face by one of his shots on the first day of the tournament. It came just before a shot by triple Open champion Tiger Woods (right) was caught on camera hitting a course marshal in the head on the 16th . South African double Open champion Els took to Twitter to offer the spectator struck by his shot free tickets . ‘I really felt bad hitting it there into the people and hurting the guy the way I did. ‘It was right in the face and you think the worst. It was like a bullet coming at him so he must have been in total shock. ‘Hopefully he's better now, but it wasn't very nice.’ Els’ opponent, Bubba Watson, who also witnessed the incident, described it as ‘heart-breaking’. He said: ‘You could tell Ernie was shaken up by it. When you hit somebody like that it's not a good scene and it's very heart-breaking.’ The man was taken to hospital to be treated for minor injuries, and reportedly received a couple of stitches, but was otherwise said to make a full recovery. Els later took to Twitter to apologise for the incident and said he had sorted some tickets for the spectator so he could return to The Open over the weekend. He wrote: ‘Really tough day today. Just spoke to the gentleman I hit on the 1st and happily he’s fine. Got him some tickets @The_Open this weekend.’ Woods’ shot on the 17th hole came after he shouted ‘Jesus Christ’ at some photographers for supposedly taking pictures of him at the wrong time as he tee’d off. A shot by Rickie Fowler on the 16th hole yesterday (above) hit marshal Bill Davies in the leg . His shot was caught on camera and footage showed the ball hitting a course marshal in the face, knocking him sideways. He is not thought to have been badly injured and is believed to have continued with his work on the course today. His fellow marshal Bill Davies, who is the president of the Vicars Cross Golf Club in Chester, also felt the blow of being hit by a golf ball at speed. He was marshalling the 16th hole on the course, when he was hit on both the leg and shoulder in two unlucky incidents. ‘I wasn't too bad, but having two detonating things happen to you within three quarters of hour, then you start worrying,’ he told BBC Radio 5 live. ‘Rickie was more interested first thing in the ball when I was lying on the floor. Anyway, he was very good about it; he said “I'm sorry”. ‘People came up to me and asked if I can get three and I replied: “You must be joking!”’ Both Fowler and Schwartzel apologised to Mr Davies for the incidents and each gave him a signed ball. All three men were thought to have escaped without serious injuries. The R&A was unable to confirm the extent of their injuries, but said none had been seriously injured and the spectator had only suffered minor injuries. A spokesman added: 'We take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of spectators at The Open Championship. 'It is relatively rare for spectators or marshals to be struck by golf balls. 'Given the nature of any golf event, we would always recommend caution when in the vicinity of play.'","One spectator and two course marshals all struck by golf balls at The Open .

"By . Emma Glanfield . This is the moment a double-bass player jumped around on stage with his Emmerdale actor bandmate despite claiming £56,000 in disability benefits because he ‘couldn’t walk 10 yards’. David Ballantyne, 60, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was receiving regular disability allowance after claiming he couldn’t work and had difficulty walking 10 to 15 yards following a knee injury. He also claimed he had pain in his neck and shoulders. However, he was found to be cheating the system when he was caught on camera jumping around on stage with his band Chuck Wagon and playing his double-bass with such ‘exuberance and enthusiasm’ it even saw him stand on the side of it. Scroll down for video . David Ballantyne, 60, (left) from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, received disability allowance for five years after claiming he had difficulty walking but was caught jumping around on stage with his band Chuck Wagon . Ballantyne (left) was caught on stage with his band Chuck Wagon, which included former Emmerdale and Birds of a Feather actor Alun Lewis, after being put under surveillance by the Department of Work and Pensions . Miles Barker, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court yesterday that his performances in 2012 were a real eye opener and said Ballantyne, who used the false name of David Roberts, played in a way that ‘clearly belied his incapacity statement'. Ballantyne was caught on stage with the ‘rock'n'roll band’, which included former Emmerdale and Birds of a Feather actor Alun Lewis, after being put under surveillance. Mr Barker told the court that a number of diaries, seized at the house where Ballantyne was living in Huddersfield, revealed that the trio had been rehearsing regularly and doing gigs across the country - even as far away from Huddersfield as Somerset. They also showed that Ballantyne had been doing IT work for individuals and companies and had helped a neighbour put up scaffolding and decorate his home, despite claiming he couldn’t work. In addition to his employment lies, he . also pretended he was a tenant at the house where he lived with his . former partner and daughter so that housing benefit was paid by Kirklees . Council. In total, he . received £25,498 in income support, £17,797 in housing benefit and . £12,828 in disability living allowance - a total of £56,124 to which he . was not entitled. He falsely claimed income support and housing benefit from 2006 to 2012, and dishonestly claimed disability living allowance for a five-year period between September 5 2007 and September 4 2012. Ballantyne (pictured left while playing  in 2012) admitted four charges of making false representations for benefit or failing to notify a change in circumstance and was jailed for one year at Leeds Crown Court . Ballantyne falsely claimed income support and housing benefit from 2006 to 2012, and received disability living allowance for a five-year period between September 5 2007 and September 4 2012 despite being healthy again . He was exposed following the joint investigation by Kirklees Council and the Department of Work and Pensions. Michael Sisson-Pell, representing Ballantyne, said he had genuinely been injured and unable to work for some years so his disability claim was not fraudulent from the outset. But, Mr Sisson-Pell said the defendant accepted his condition had improved and he knew he should have notified the department. The defence lawyer also told the court how the trio had mainly played in the Huddersfield area and, after paying agents’ fees and petrol, usually received about £70 each per gig. He said Ballantyne had become homeless in 2006 and moved back to his former partner’s home. They had not resumed a sexual relationship but he accepted he lived as a family. ‘It was a distinction that was lost on him,’ said Mr Sisson-Pell. Ballantyne admitted four charges of making false representations for benefit or failing to notify a change in circumstance and was jailed for 12 months by recorder Tim Hirst who said he had failed to disclose the truth about his improving condition.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Prince Harry could celebrate his forthcoming 30th birthday with a ‘St Moritz-themed’ extravaganza at Kensington Palace, it has been revealed. The prince, who turns 30 on September 15, is set to shun London’s nightclubs in favour of a private party with friends and family at the royal palace. It is thought the royal will enjoy an intimate dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and 30 friends before celebrating with a lavish after-party. Prince Harry, who turns 30 on September 15, is set to shun London's nightclubs in favour of a private party with friends and family at Kensington Palace . One source said an empty drawing room, which used to house art classes, would be the central hub of the ‘chic’ party. The room is set to be decked out with white leather sofas, drapes and décor in the style of St Moritz – the Swiss ski resort popular with the rich and famous. According to The Sun, the source said the event reflected Prince Harry's newfound maturity. ‘At the moment the old drawing school is empty. Easels are resting in the corners. But it will get a stylish makeover. This is an important birthday for Harry and he's not going to fall out of a club late at night. He's keen to show that he has come of age,’ the source told the newspaper. Prince William and Kate have reportedly taken over planning of the big birthday from Cressida Bonas, the former girlfriend of Prince Harry following their split in April. As well as the private party, the prince is also set to receive £10million of his mother Diana's inheritance on his birthday. It is thought the prince will enjoy an intimate dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and 30 friends before celebrating with a St Moritz-themed after-party at Kensington Palace, west London (above) The prince is reportedly keen on the party taking a St Moritz theme, with  white leather sofas, drapes and décor in the style of the Swiss ski resort (above) which is popular with the rich and famous . The milestone means he will take control of half of a trust fund believed to be worth more than £20million. He faces a £4million deduction due to inheritance tax, but experts say he could slash the bill if he gives some of the money to charity. Princess Diana bequeathed the trust to the prince and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, who were 12 and 15 respectively at the time of her death in 1997. Diana left a net estate of £12,966,022- after inheritance tax of £8,502,330 was deducted - but it is widely believed that with shrewd investment the fund has almost doubled. Her estate comprised stocks and shares, jewellery, cash from her £17million divorce settlement, dresses and other personal belongings at her Kensington Palace apartment. Diana stipulated that it would be held in trust to be shared equally between her two sons. In her original will, drawn up in 1993, the princess had stipulated that both princes would be entitled to their entire share of the capital on reaching 25.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Petra Stunt, 25, appointed Paul Fleury in 2012 to help with the £25m refurbishment of her London home . A ‘sophisticated fraudster’ who conned the daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone out of £1.6m while renovating her £25m Chelsea mansion has been jailed for nine months. Paul Fleury, 45, was appointed by Petra Ecclestone, 25, in February 2012 after she bought one of London’s most magnificent townhouses - Sloane House - for £70million. The socialite, who now goes by her married name of Petra Stunt, had a budget of £25million to transform the historic building in West London, including a new wing featuring a pool, gymnasium and underground car park. She appointed Fleury – a trusted friend who had worked for the family for the past seven years – to carry out the renovation, but he ended up defrauding her of £1.58m of the budget. Mrs Stunt, who alongside sister Tamara, 29, is often portrayed as spending ‘Daddy’s billions, discovered last year how Fleury – who was paid £7,000 a month to manage the renovation work – was forging invoices from companies that did not exist and paying them into his own bank accounts. Fleury claimed his payments had been verbally agreed with the heiress and said they were ‘commissions’– a claim denied by the Ecclestones. Last month, a High Court judge ruled that Mrs Stunt was entitled to summary judgment against the fraudster and an injunction was imposed to freeze Fleury’s assets. However, a court hearing today heard how Fleury failed to comply with the freezing order and he was jailed for nine months by Mr Justice Turner. During the hearing, Mrs Stunt’s counsel, David Cavender QC, described Fleury as a ‘sophisticated fraudster’ and said his defence was ‘inherently incredible’ and an ‘obvious fabrication’. Dismissing Fleury’s case as hopeless, Mr Justice Turner said his defence was ‘a convenient lie which he invented months after his wrongdoing had come to light’. The judge agreed with lawyers for Sloane House Ltd - Mrs Stunt’s company which engaged the contractors undertaking the redevelopment - that Fleury had flouted the terms of an injunction freezing his assets and should receive an immediate prison term as punishment for his flagrant contempt of court. Mrs Stunt bought one of London's most magnificent townhouses - Sloane House - for £70million in February 2012 and appointed Paul Fleury, 45, to oversee lavish renovations which she set aside a budget of £25m for . He said Fleury had demonstrated that he was capable of serious dishonesty to achieve substantial financial gain and, in addition, was willing not merely to push against the boundaries of legitimate interpretation of the scope of the injunction but deliberately to act in surreptitious breach despite the real threat of imprisonment. He added that the breaches had not been limited to a misguided attempt to preserve Fleury’s mechanical installation, servicing and repair business but had also facilitated the maintenance of his ‘hedonistic lifestyle’. After the hearing, Petra, who is married to billionaire James Stunt, said: ‘It is an extremely unpleasant experience to discover that a person who you have placed in a position of trust is deceiving you and to find that, even when discovered, they have continued to engineer ways to breach the freezing order imposed to restrain them. ‘As this matter is now in the hands of the Metropolitan Police, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.’ Petra, 25, (left) is the daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone (centre) and sister of Tamara (right) Robert Wynn Jones, of law firm Mishcon de Reya, said: ‘It is important that the courts impose custodial sentences in these circumstances. ‘Freezing orders are an essential part of the legal toolkit in these types of fraud cases and to have them flagrantly breached as they have been in this instance is unacceptable. ‘When you get an order freezing assets and for asset disclosure in a fraud case, you expect the defendant to comply. ‘If they don’t comply, serious consequences can follow - including imprisonment - as has occurred in this case.’","Petra Ecclestone - now Petra Stunt - bought Sloane House in February 2012 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Hollyoaks has overtaken EastEnders as Britain’s most violent soap opera with threatening scenes occurring on average 11.5 times per hour, according to a study by media regulator Ofcom. The Channel 4 programme, aimed at teens and young adults, has seen the number of violent scenes increase considerably in recent years and last year it was censured by Ofcom. Hollyoaks has risen from 2.1 violent scenes per hour in 2001/2 to 11.5 scenes per hour last year. At the same time EastEnders has seen a dramatic fall from 6.1 to 2.1 over the same period. Scroll down for video . The number of violent scenes in Hollyoaks (above) has risen from 2.1 per hour in 2001/2 to 11.5 scenes per hour last year. Pictured: Nicole Barber-Lane's character Myra McQueen was attacked in August last year . ITV's Coronation Street has remained largely steady at 3, while Emmerdale has seen an increase during those years from 2.5 to 4. The new research comes just days after one broadcaster was given a substantial fine by the regulator for screening graphic depictions of ‘extreme violence’ including torture, a child murder and dismemberment of a corpse before the watershed. Investigation Discovery was given a £100,000 penalty for screening eight episodes of its documentary series Deadly Women during daytime schedules. For the new Ofcom study, researchers looked at 282 episodes of the four soaps and found that more than half of all the violent scenes they recorded were in Hollyoaks. The Channel 4 show also accounted for all of what were classed as ‘strong violence’, much of them coming from two storylines. Almost three-quarters of the scenes classed as violent were made up of threats and intimidation or incidents such as pushing, prodding and tripping. Fists were used in only five per cents of the incidents - slightly fewer than the slaps which made up six per cent- and the shooting of firearms made up less than one per cent. EastEnders (above) is no longer Britain's most violent soap, with threatening scenes having seen a dramatic fall from 6.1 per hour in 2001/2 to 2.1 per hour last year. Pictured: Peter Beale threatens Billy Mitchell . In its report Ofcom said: ‘The conclusion must be that the amount of violence logged in a soap appears to be largely determined by the storylines running at a particular time. ‘In Hollyoaks all the violent scenes with a high severity rating were either central or pivotal to the storyline in which they appeared. Violence occurred for a reason, and was used to drive the narrative along. ‘In the overwhelming number of cases it was considered to add dramatic value to the plot or the characterisations.’ The report pointed out that violence in the soaps - which it said in most cases was ‘quite mild’ - did not trivialise, glamorise or condone it. And it said that for the most part viewers would have been aware they could expect the violent scenes and would not have been surprised by it. Last year Ofcom ruled that Hollyoaks breached its programme code by screening a scene before the watershed in which character Simon Walker was pushed under a train. However there have not been any major viewer complaints about violence in the series since then. Hollyoaks also accounted for all of what were classed as 'strong violence' scenes. Pictured: Characters Ste and Freddie, dressed in boiler suits and balaclavas, hold up a delivery van of drugs in an episode aired last year . A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘We are committed to ensuring that all Hollyoaks storylines are appropriate for a pre-watershed audience. ‘The portrayal of violence is appropriately limited and is shown within the context of long-running storylines - and programmes that include scenes which some people may find upsetting are clearly flagged to viewers at the beginning of the broadcast. ‘Hollyoaks has a track record in tackling issues affecting its audience and has worked alongside government and leading charities on subjects such as domestic abuse and bullying.’ The sharp rise in the number of violent scenes in Hollyoaks over the last few years has included a number of major storylines. Ofcom statistics show the number of threatening scenes in the Channel 4 soap has risen from 2.1 per hour in 2001/2 to 11.5 per hour last year. Some of the more recent Hollyoaks storylines have seen characters embroiled in violence, crime and tragedy. Unsuspecting Myra McQueen – played by Nicole Barber-Lane - was attacked and later shot by Dr Paul Browning, towards the end of last year. Some of the more recent Hollyoaks storylines have seen characters embroiled in violence, crime and tragedy. Pictured: Ste torches's Fraser Black's car as the whodunnit into his murder continues . More recently, the body of arch villain Fraser Black was found slumped in a car at a petrol station after he was shot dead. The drama focused on a ‘whodunnit-style’ killing which later revealed Freddie Roscoe to be his killer. However, some of the biggest drama of the show came last year when - to celebrate the soap turning 18 years old - five main characters were killed off in one week. Ash Kane and Doug Carter were killed in an explosion, while Claire Devine was ran over by Dr Browning after Mercedes McQueen pushed her in front of his car. Callum Kane and newcomer Jade Hedy were also killed off in Hollyoaks Later. Last year, the Channel 4 show was wrapped by Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules in an episode, screened at 6.30pm, in which a main character was killed by a speeding train. The scene, aired in March, marked the culmination of a long-running revenge storyline involving a former undercover policeman, Walker, and ex-drug dealer Brendan. Hollyoaks was wrapped by Ofcom after a scene, aired before the watershed in March last year, followed the death of a character Walker (above) who was killed by a speeding train . It . ended with Walker screaming as he fell backwards on to the railway track . and into the path of a train before the camera cut away to show the . train passing at high speed. There were no images of Walker being hit by the train but the fight in the build-up included several blows to the face and stomach, Brendan’s head being pushed through railings, Walker with bloody lips and blood running from his nose, while viewers heard the groans as they inflicted blows. Channel 4 said that the storyline had run for around a year and that viewers were notified that a dramatic episode would be broadcast. Tina McIntyre - played by Michelle Keegan - was killed off in Coronation Street earlier this year . However, . Ofcom said the pre-programme information was too vague and would 'not . have prepared the significant number of younger viewers in the audience, . or their parents, adequately for the violent, intense and shocking . scenes which followed.' Other dramatic storylines in popular British soaps so far this year include the death of Tina McIntyre – played by Michelle Keegan – in Coronation Street. The barmaid could be seen lying motionless on the cobbles after plunging from the balcony of the builder’s yard flat following a dramatic showdown in an episode aired towards the end of May. And in EastEnders fans were glued to their screens in April when Lucy Beale in a ‘whodunnit-style’ killing.","Hollyoaks has overtaken EastEnders as country's most violent soap opera .

The six-time Gold medallist, who is Team GB's most successful Olympian, was due to commentate on today's action at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow on the opening day of the Commonwealth Games. BBC Radio 5live reported how Sir Chris was asked for identification to enter his own velodrome - after the female guard did not recognise him. Scroll down for video . Sir Chris Hoy, pictured here at the velodrome which bears his name, was refused entry to the stadium because he did not have the right accreditation . After explaining who he was, Sir Chris was allowed in by the official for the start of the action. Realising her error, the embarrassed guard told a 5live reporter: 'Please, please can you apologise to him.' The woman, who claimed Sir Chris had been on the telephone at the time, added: 'I didn't realise who he was. My mum is going to kill me!' He then tweeted: 'All set and ready to go here at the velodrome, nice vantage point here up in the commentary box!' After explaining who he was, Sir Chris was allowed in to the velodrome - which bears his name, as pictured above - by the official for the start of the action . The Olympian was clearly unfazed by the incident, tweeting: 'She was just doing her job!!' A Commonwealth Games spokesperson was unavailable for comment. Earlier this week gold medal-winning . cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins complained that Sir Chris Hoy had been 'done . over' by the corporate branding on the velodrome. Wiggins said: 'I'd be a bit p***** off . if I were him, because they've stuck a great big Emirates sign over his . name and it doesn't stand out that it's the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome . other than a little thing as you walk in.

"By . Chris Hastings . This could be the most lucrative ‘light-bulb moment’ ever. An artwork which consists of nothing more than lights turning on and off in an empty room is expected to fetch up to £70,000 when it is auctioned by Christie’s next month. But the winning bidder will not even get the bulbs or switches needed to recreate the controversial piece – just a certificate of authenticity, signed by British artist Martin Creed, giving permission to use the idea. Bright idea: British artist Martin Creed's Work No 127, which consists of light bulbs . being turned on, pictured above, and off, is expected to fetch £70,00 . when it is auctioned by Christie's in London next month . The winning bidder will not get the bulbs or switches needed to recreate . the piece but will receive a certificate of authenticity, signed . by the Turner Prize-winning artist, giving permission for the person to use the idea . The work has split the art world, with critics claiming it is the ultimate example of the ‘emperor’s  new clothes’ while others celebrate a radical example of ‘art as an idea’. Christie’s is understood to be employing an electrician to set up  its own version of Work No 127: The Lights Going On And Off so potential buyers can experience a room switching from light to darkness every 30 seconds. Charles Thomson, the head of the Stuckist Group of traditionalist artists, condemned Creed’s installation as ‘a mundane experience’ rather than a work of art. He said: ‘It’s not so much a question of the lights going on and off it’s a question of the brain going on and off. ‘People are effectively being asked to pay £70,000 for something they could reproduce quite easily in your own home. It just shows the complete madness of the current thinking in the art world.’ Creed, 46, created the work in 1995 as a precursor to his near-identical piece No 227: The Lights Going On And Off – this time at five-second intervals – which went on to win the Turner Prize in 2001. The decision to award Creed the £20,000 prize proved to be one of the most controversial in the competition’s history and protesters picketed the ceremony. Madonna, pictured right, presented the Turner Prize to Mr Creed, pictured left, when he won the prestigious award for a near-identical piece of work, called No 227, in 2001 . Madonna, who subsequently presented the award, described art prizes as ‘silly’ and said there could be no correlation between good art and money. But she said: ‘I want to support any artist who not only has something to say but the balls to say it.’ Work No 227 was subsequently bought by the Tate Gallery for more than £100,000, and it could be another gallery that buys No 127 at Christie’s. It is being sold by the current owner, a private collector. For your own Turner-winning work, follow our simple instructions: . 1) Depress light switch as illustrated. 2) Wait 30 seconds. 3) Repeat until you are offered £70,000. Or have an electrician install a timer for £200. Creed is now regarded as one of the leading conceptual artists in the country. Other works have included a sheet of A4 paper scrunched up into a ball (No 88), a lump of kneaded Blu-Tack stuck on a wall (No 79), and athletes running through the galleries of Tate Britain (No 850). Michael Daley, the head of ArtWatch UK, said of the lights installation: ‘It’s only an artwork in the narrow loopy confines of the modern contemporary art establishment. Christie’s are just selling pretentious junk to chumps who want to buy into “cool”.” But Sir Norman Rosenthal, one of Britain’s most respected art historians, said: ‘I am a fan of Creed and I think he has a place. His work is not over heavy. It’s very slight and sexy and good fun. I can see the point.’ Sir Norman said he probably wouldn’t want Work No 127 in his front room, but added: ‘Art is not like that. You don’t have to like it. You are not obliged. But if you are involved in the language and the discourse of art then yes it is art.’ Other works in the Christie’s Post-war and Contemporary Art Sale in London, on July 1 will include Tracey Emin’s My Bed – being sold by Charles Saatchi for an estimated £1 million – and a portrait of the artist Lucian Freud by Francis Bacon, which was owned by Roald Dahl and is valued at up to £12 million. Martin Creed was last night unavailable for comment.","Work No 127 consists of bulbs switching from light to dark in an empty room .

"By . Chris Hastings . The creators of BBC police drama Happy Valley have hit back at critics to insist it is a ‘feminist’ thriller which merely reflects real life. The programme – featuring the brutal kidnapping of a young woman by a sadistic rapist – has been accused of ‘dehumanising’ viewers by including harrowing scenes of gratuitous violence against women. But Sally Wainwright, who wrote the six-part series, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I don’t know how to answer the question about depictions of violence against women. BBC series Happy Valley has come in for crticism after it depicted its heroine being savagely beaten, but the creators insist the drama is 'feminist' at heart as she will 'emerge victorious' 'But a lot of violence in real life is against women. It really is aimed at women.’ Happy Valley stars Sarah Lancashire as police sergeant Catherine Cawood. Last week’s harrowing episode, the fourth of the series, ended with rapist Tommy Lee Royce, played by James Norton, attacking his own drug addict mother and then brutally beating Cawood and leaving her for dead in a cellar. The rapist called the barely conscious officer a ‘bitch’ then told her: ‘You are going to be eating food through a straw for the rest of your life. You are going to need someone to wipe your a*** for you.’ The show’s seven million viewers know the unhinged Lee Royce is capable of any act of depravity and have already seen him drug and rape the kidnap victim and murder another female police officer by running her over in his car. Vivienne Pattison, head of viewers campaign group Mediawatch UK, said such scenes of brutality threatened to ‘dehumanise’ viewers and ‘stunt their emotional growth’. But Euros Lyn, who has directed three of the series’s episodes, last night insisted the programme was  a feminist drama at heart. In last week's episode sergeant Catherine Carwood (pictured, played by Sarah Lancashire) was beaten by rapist Tommy Lee Royce (played by James Norton, right) who left her for dead in a cellar . He said: ‘There is absolutely violence against women in this piece. There is also violence against men. But what is interesting is that this is a proper feminist thriller. ‘We have Catherine as this strong woman in her mid 40s as our heroine. As you follow her journey you see who suffers and who is the ultimate victor. You will see a woman who triumphed.’ But last week’s attack on Cawood also proved to be a tough watch for some of the show’s fans who vented their feelings on Twitter. One wrote that they were ‘still recovering’ from the episode hours later. Another said: ‘If you weren’t on edge and your jaw wasn’t locked in down position after last night’s Happy Valley then check for brain activity.’ Devotees of the show insist that the graphic violence has not distracted from what they claim is one of the most gripping police dramas ever screened. The BBC1 programme, set in Yorkshire’s Calder Valley, has already been tipped for Bafta success next year.","Happy Valley features brutal kidnapping of young woman by rapist .

"By . Chris Hastings . Joanna Trollope, one of Britain’s most celebrated authors, has donated the handwritten manuscripts of her novels to Oxford’s Bodleian Library in order to stop them leaving the country. Miss Trollope’s gifting of the material puts her at odds with writers such as David Hare and Salman Rushdie, who sold their archives to overseas libraries and universities which easily outbid their cash-strapped British counterparts. Miss Trollope, 70, said: ‘It is up to people whether they sell it or give it away but I very much wanted the papers to stay in England. Miss Trollope, left, fifth-generation niece of playwight Anthony Trollope, right, wants to keep works in England . ‘I am English, the novels are English . and as a nation we still read a vast amount of fiction...The fact is . British institutions struggle when these things are put up for sale.’ In . recent years the University of Texas at Austin, in particular, has seen . off the British Library to snap up prized papers including those of . playwright Sir Tom Stoppard. Experts . say that institutions around the world would have bid for the archive . and it could have attracted a price tag of £100,000. Miss Trollope, whose works include The Choir and The Soldier’s Wife, said the collection had sparked an ‘amicable tussle’ between the British Library and the Bodleian. Miss Trollope used the Bodleian as a student at Oxford in the 1960s. She said: ‘I know people let their material go to Austin but I wanted my archive to go to somewhere personal to me.’ Joanna Trollope has donated the manuscripts to the Bodleian Library, where she used to study . Her donation contains the manuscripts to all 30 of her novels, as well as her extensive research for each book, including anonymous interviews with the people who inspired her characters. Richard Ovenden, Director of Library Services or ‘Bodley’s Librarian’, said he hoped other writers would follow Trollope’s lead. He added: ‘We are delighted that Joanna Trollope is gifting her archive to the Bodleian. She is one of the most successful novelists of her generation and as somebody who graduated in English literature at Oxford we are immensely proud of her success as a writer.’ And Friends of the National Libraries chairman Lord Egremont said: ‘Manuscripts of our literary heritage are our nation’s DNA: Joanna’s gift is important and very generous.’ Miss Trollope said she can spend up . to two years working on a book. ‘The research is a big deal for me. I am . trying to get across the authenticity of the people I am writing about . and I don’t want the reader to be tripped up by mistakes in the . background.’ She . worked at the Foreign Office prior to becoming a full-time writer in . 1980 and has already sent 50 boxes of material to the Bodleian, which . was established in 1602. Sir Salman Rushdie, left, and Sir Tom Stoppard, right, are high profile writers whose manuscripts are abroad . In the past five years Miss Trollope has written five books and has promised to donate material relating to all her future novels. She still pens all her novels by hand, saying: ‘I write newspaper articles and speeches on a computer but when I am writing a novel, I still do it by hand. I just need the silence of writing a novel because I am kind of describing a movie I can hear and see in my head.’ The author, who is a fifth-generation niece of the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope, hopes her own technique will help anyone studying the material to realise literary success does not come overnight. She said: ‘I write on the right hand of the page and I leave the left hand blank and that is where I make  my notes and alterations. I hope people who study the manuscripts will be able to see how the novels are evolving.’ Miss Trollope added that she is ‘appalled’ by the closure of local libraries, which she insists still have a role to play. She said: ‘What they symbolise as well as what they are is ever more important. In this increasingly digitised world they represent something solid and safe in communities. ‘In the old days we went into a church for sanctuary and I think librarians are going to represent that sort of sanctuary in the future.’","Joanna Trollope has given her manuscripts to Oxford's Bodleian Library .

"By . Chris Hastings . TV chef Lorraine Pascale’s adoptive mother tried to strangle and suffocate her when she was a little girl - and thought of hurling her under the wheels of a lorry. The star has discovered she was placed on the at-risk register aged three because her adoptive mother told social workers she feared she might kill her. Adopted by a white family at 18 months, the former model never knew why she was subsequently separated from her adoptive mother at the age of eight and placed into emergency foster care. But the presenter, 41, has learned how a desperate Audrey Woodward, reeling from a broken marriage, warned Oxfordshire social services the little girl’s life was in danger. Scroll down for video . Horror: The adoptive mother of TV chef Lorraine Pascale (pictured) tried to strangle and suffocate her when she was a little girl - and thought of hurling her under the wheels of a lorry . A horrified Pascale uncovered details of the abuse while making a BBC documentary on fostering. The star, who says she cannot recall the incidents, said: ‘To learn I was on the at-risk register from 1976 was enlightening, daunting and sad.’ In the documentary, Pascale is left sickened by files detailing conversations between her adoptive mother and officials. She is lost for the words when she comes across a passage in which Woodward, who had a son of her own, told officials she had considered throwing Lorraine under a lorry. The first memo, dated 1976 and referring to Pascale as a child at risk, states: ‘Mother is worried about the pressure building up and feels like she is about to take it out on adopted daughter. 'She said she had exploded and smacked the children very hard but knew she was particularly heavy handed with Lorraine. Worry: Audrey Woodward (pictured) struggled to look after Lorraine Pascale when her marriage broke down. She grew increasingly concerned at how heavy-handed she was becoming . ‘She had always been confused about her feelings towards the child and quoted an incident when she was walking with Lorraine and a large lorry was travelling in their direction and she had looked at the wheels and thought if she pushed Lorraine under them it would solve all her problems. Concern: Lorraine Pascale (pictured) was placed on at-risk register aged three by worried social workers . ‘Although she has not been drinking for over two months, she is afraid if she had a drink she would not know where to stop and could not control her feelings.’ Another note, dated 1981, states: ‘The mother was in an agitated state and demanded that we take her daughter into care as she could not stand her any longer. 'She said she dreaded the school holidays and was sure she would do Lorraine some damage. ‘She said she had already tried to strangle her and suffocate her and had hit her before she went to school this morning. 'She said the only way she could keep from hitting Lorraine was to keep her locked in her bedroom.’ In the programme, the star describes the contents of the file as ‘devastating’ and leaves the room to escape the cameras.

"By . Chris Hastings . Prince Charles was asked by Government Ministers for permission to introduce a Bill that would have stripped him of some of  his powers, including his right to  veto legislation . Prince Charles was asked by Government Ministers for permission to introduce a Bill that would have stripped him of some of  his powers, including his right to veto legislation. Private letters obtained by The Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws show that Chloe Smith, the former Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, wrote to Charles to seek his ‘consent’ for the Private Member’s Bill – which he gave some weeks later. The Bill failed at its second reading but sources close to Labour peer Lord Berkeley, who introduced it into Parliament, say a new draft version has now been sent to Charles. The correspondence sheds new light on the process whereby Ministers are required to seek Charles’s consent for any draft Bills that have implications for his Duchy of Cornwall estate. In theory he can veto any aspect of a Bill that might affect the interests of the estate, which has land and property holdings worth £700 million. On October 2 last year, Ms Smith’s office wrote to William Nye, the Prince’s private secretary, asking for consent for the Rights of the Sovereign and the Duchy of Cornwall Bill. The letter read: ‘I am writing to ask if His Royal Highness would be pleased to give his consent in respect of the Rights of the Sovereign and the Duchy of Cornwall Bill. ‘This letter explains the intent of the particular areas where we consider that it requires the  consent of the Prince of Wales to be sought. ‘I attach a copy of the Bill which would remove the current requirement for Queen’s and Prince’s consent to be given to some pieces of legislation, transfer the assets and property from the Duchy of Cornwall to a public trust and remove the male bias in the descent of the title; and limit which members of the of the Royal Family may claim travel expenses under what circumstances.’ In his reply of October 30, Nye wrote: ‘I can confirm the Duke of Cornwall’s consent to place his  prerogative and interests at the disposal of Parliament.’ The documents reveal that Ministers in the Cabinet Office sought Charles’s consent for three different measures between September  1, 2013, and January  27, 2014. The idea that Bills should require the consent of either the Queen or Prince Charles has come under increasing criticism. Chloe Smith, the former Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, wrote to Charles to seek his 'consent' for the Private Member's Bill - which he gave some weeks later . Last month MPs on the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee branded the rules ‘arcane and complex’. Critics were particularly scathing about the decision to refer Lord Berkeley’s Bill to the heir to the throne. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘The need to signal the Queen’s and Prince’s consent for certain Bills is a long-standing parliamentary requirement and the parliamentary authorities decide when it  is required.’ A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment but said that consent had been given on every occasion in the modern era.","Former minister Chloe Smith wrote to Prince to seek 'consent' for Bill .

"By . Chris Hastings . Mary Beard is favourite to front the remake of the BBC's Civilisation . Mary Beard has emerged as the leading candidate to present the BBC’s Civilisation after a host of female celebrities demanded a woman front the series. The outspoken classicist would take on the mantle of Kenneth Clark in the original 1969 show. Novelist Kathy Lette has recruited more than 30 household names to sign a petition encouraging the BBC to give the coveted job to a woman. Other signatories include human rights barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy and novelists Kate Mosse. Joanna Trollope, Jemima Khan, Bianca Jagger, Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti and Jo Brand also all signed. Lette said a female voice ‘would ensure [Civilisation] won’t just be about History but also Herstory.’ She also put forward AS Byatt and Hermione Lee for the role. The 13-part 1969 series is still regarded as one of the greatest British programmes ever made. Other possibilities for the new job include Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum and Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate. The BBC’s own presenters Jeremy Paxman, David Dimbleby and Andrew Marr are also being considered. Last night a spokesman for the BBC declined to comment.

"By . Chris Hastings . Sir David Attenborough’s heart-warming encounter with a group of Rwandan gorillas on his Life On Earth show remains one of TV’s most iconic moments. But the broadcaster’s surprise interaction with the gorillas – who clambered all over him – was almost never captured because of an argument between the film crew over whether it was appropriate for a serious nature documentary. In an interview on today’s Reunion programme on BBC Radio 4, cameraman Martin Saunders reveals he was nearly stopped from shooting the encounter because producer John Sparks thought it would remind viewers too much of children’s show Animal Magic. David Attenborough with Rwandan mountain gorillas in the heart-warming scene in Life on Earth . He said: ‘I was arguing with John about filming it because he didn’t want to. He said it was an evolutionary series and it looked too much like Animal Magic.’ Mr Saunders reveals he took it upon himself to begin belatedly filming the 20-minute encounter, below, and managed to get about a ‘minute or so’ worth of footage. On today’s programme, which reunites the cast and crew of the 1979 series, Sir David recalls  his shock when he realised the whole episode had not been captured  on film. He said: ‘I saw Martin and John and said that was the most fantastic experience of my life, and John said, “Yep, I think we got a few seconds of it.” I said, “I was there a long time – what do you mean a few seconds?” ’ The scene could have been cut from the show - as producers thought it might not be suitable for a serious wildlife documentary . Sir David had believed until today that Mr Saunders did not have enough film in his camera and was surprised to hear the real reason for the lack of footage. The cameraman tells him: ‘We were arguing while  you were sitting with those gorillas.’ A clearly surprised Sir David replies: ‘Thanks pal.’","Sir David's encounter with Rwandan gorillas could have been cut .

Students from the University of Warwick Rowing Society dressed down for the shoot, which sold 1,500 copies, and raised thousands of pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support. The 17 members of the group posed naked in their boat house and in action the River Avon before posting the pictures on both Facebook and Twitter. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Warwick Uni Rowing Club's 2013 charity calender strip . One of the pictures taken as part of the women's University of Warwick Rowing Society's charity calendar . Facebook has completely removed the page after stating that the page's content breached its 'terms of use' The group’s aim was to drum up more support from fans around the world and top their £3,400 total raised for the charity. But the girls have been left devastated after Facebook removed their page ‘Warwick Rowing’s Women’s Naked Calendar’ for its ‘explicitly sexual content’. The rowers were told they were breaching the social media sites’ ‘nudity and pornography’ policy. Organiser Sophie Bell, 20, has blasted Facebook’s decision for harming their chances of raising more money for charity with their 2015 calendar, due to be released later this year. The history and politics student, who has just finished her second year, said: ‘Facebook can unpublish pages after it gives you a warning to make amendments. ‘That happened to us a couple of times over the last year where they would ask us to remove certain pictures randomly because they breached their nudity and porn regulations.

The group has already shot its 2015 calendar, which is due to be released in October this year . The rowers have sent countless emails to Facebook in a bid to try and get their page back up and running . ‘We always made the amendments and took the pictures down - even though they were no racier than the others - but a few days ago they emailed and said the page was being completely removed. ‘They say it is because of nudity but we are not violating any of their terms and all the pictures we post are not indecent images or inappropriate. ‘It is awful for us because we had over 2,000 likes which provides us with a large platform for reaching out to our target market. ‘We are students so we don’t have a marketing budget so we do use social media as the main way of marketing it. ‘To have this page unfairly taken away is . going to affect our sales for the 2015 calendar and decrease the amount . we can make for charity. ‘There are loads of similar nude charity . calendars who have Facebook pages plastered across the site - why aren’t . they being asked to takes theirs down too.’ Hettie Reed, 22, who also organised the calendar, said the photos are 'tasteful' and not 'pornographic' In an email sent to the rowers, Facebook told them their site had been removed for ‘violating’ its terms of use. It said: ‘Continued misuse of Facebook’s features could result in the permanent loss of your account.’ The group has sent countless emails to . the US site in order to try and explain their situation but have yet to . receive a response. But Sophie, who is originally from Upminster, Essex, added: ‘It is a charity calendar - how can it be porn? ‘The Facebook account for the male . rower’s charity calendar hasn’t been deleted and their page is the same . as ours.

"By . Gemma Mullin . A little boy with a severe allergy to tomatoes was rushed to hospital after ketchup nearly killed him. Ruben Curie, two, from Rhondda in Wales, went into anaphylactic shock after he stuck his finger in one of his sibling’s dinner. His parents Kasie and Wayne Curie say they will never take him to McDonalds after fearing he would die during the reaction. The moment little Ruben, two, was rushed to hospital by ambulance after touching the tomato ketchup . Kasie Curie, 24, feared son Ruben, two, would die after he swelled up so much he could hardly breathe . The toddler was just a year old when his face and tongue swelled so badly he could no longer breathe properly. Mrs Curie, 24, said: ‘When I saw his face was so swollen I honestly thought he was going to die.' It was in September 2013 when she served her other children dinner with tomato ketchup that Ruben touched the sauce and got a small bit on the end of his finger. His mother wiped off the ketchup and put him to bed. Later that night when his brother, Craig, four, began making a lot of noise upstairs Mr Curie, 40, went to check on him. He quickly returned with Ruben in his arms who had gone into anaphylactic shock. Ruben (left) was diagnosed with eczema which he would scratch until it bled and (right) with his mother Kasie . His worried mother said: ‘I was hysterical. I couldn’t look at him. ‘My husband had to stay with him while I waited outside and called the ambulance. I was so scared that we might lose him.’ He was rushed to hospital by ambulance where medics gave him steroids and antihistamines. Within 20 minutes his face had settled down and he was able to breathe normally. Mrs Curie said: ‘We were discharged quite quickly as his face stopped being as puffy. ‘It wasn’t until the next morning when he started to look like himself again.’ Doctors suggested that the tomatoes may have been the cause. To prevent the toddler facing a severe reaction again all of his food has to be specially prepared for nursery. Ruben (centre) with his dad Wayne, brother Craig, four, mother Kasie, newborn 10-week-old baby sister Daisy and older sister Faith, five. The family feared the little boy might die after getting the ketchup on his finger . The boy was initially diagnosed with acne but doctors later discovered he was suffering from eczema . ‘The thought of him touching one of the other children’s tomatoes or ketchup still scares me and we are always on edge. ‘We steer clear or places like McDonald’s because we know there is going to be ketchup everywhere.’ She added: ‘I was amazed that something as simple as ketchup could have such a reaction.’ Developing an allergy to tomatoes or tomato-based products is 'extremely rare', according to Healthline. Doctors believe an individual with a tomato allergy is also prone to allergic reactions with other nightshades, including potatoes, tobacco, and eggplant. Healthline also say people with a tomato allergy will have a cross-reaction to latex as well (latex-fruit syndrome). Despite its rarity there has been some tragedy with tomato allergies. In 2004, a woman from Kent suffered a freak allergic reaction to tomatoes and died while preparing dinner for her four children. Raya French was opening a tin of spaghetti bolognese when the tomatoes in the sauce sent her into anaphylactic shock. The 37-year-old, from Tankerton in Kent, was taken to hospital after she collapsed, but never regained consciousness. She was allowed to die four days later when the family decided that she had no chance of survival. It took a year for the family to realise that Ruben had an allergy to the red fruit as he was initially diagnosed with acne. The toddler would scratch the spots that appeared when he was a few weeks old to such an extent he would be covered in blood. This later led doctors to diagnose him with eczema and he was prescribed emollient cream Diprobase and then steroids, but the skin problems got progressively worse. Mrs Curie said: ‘It was horrible for us seeing him like that. He was one of the happiest babies you could ever see when he wasn’t scratching, but he was very distressed by it.’ His parents then noticed that meals containing tomatoes left the toddler with hives all over his skin. ‘We cut all tomatoes out of his diet, and this seemed to help with the majority of his symptoms,’ added Mrs Curie. Since . the ketchup incident, he has had another three anaphylactic incidents . despite his eagle-eyed parents keeping a constant watch over him. ‘He went into shock after eating a single baked bean. ‘He put it in his mouth and he started getting hives and other symptoms.’ The incidents were not as severe as with the tomato ketchup but he was still rushed to hospital. Mrs . Curie’s other children Craig, four, and Faith, five, know how serious . Ruben’s allergy is so make sure to keep anything containing tomato away . from him. The . couple’s latest addition, 13-week old baby Daisy, will be taught when . she is old enough that Ruben cannot be touched by what could be a deadly . tomato. Mrs Curie said: ‘He is an amazing little boy and I wouldn’t change him at all. ‘I do worry about tomatoes coming into contact with him, but I think as he gets older he will just stay out of their way.’ Ruben, two, pictured with his older brother Craig, four, who raised the alarm on the night of the allergic reaction .

A Land Rover dumped in a car park in Lowestoft, Suffolk and posted to Facebook group by Stuart . A van left dumped on double yellow lines (left) and an Audi taking up two spaces in a car park were snapped . He has captured vehicles taking up two spaces in car parks and some dumped on double-yellow lines. He said: ‘I started the page to highlight how bad the parking is round here and the potential danger it causes. ‘There are never any wardens around and the situation is getting worse week by week.’ Stuart, who is asking people to send their own pictures into the page, continued: ‘People just abandon their cars wherever they feel like it. This car was snapped and posted on Facebook page 'Park It Right Lowestoft' after parking on a kerb . Another car was photographed flouting the parking rules and was dumped across a pedestrian path . The campaigner has been praised by Waveney District Council for his 'public service' after shaming motorists . ‘It's very selfish because it is often inconvenient, poses a safety risk and is very annoying.’ He added: ‘Some of my friends and family think I shouldn't be bothering, but some of the parking is just dangerous and selfish and it's annoying.’ He has also handed some of his photographs of offenders, which clearly show the date time and places as well as registration number, to local police community support officers. A Lowestoft police spokesman said: ‘We urge people not to park irresponsibly. ‘Inconsiderate parking will be targeted because it can cause an obstruction. It can lead to warning notices, fixed penalty tickets and even the seizure and removal of vehicles.’ The parking campaigner has handed some of his pictures to the local police team which has issued a warning . Stuart said family and friends have told him not to bother but he thinks the parking is 'dangerous' and 'selfish' Staff at Waveney District Council praised his ‘public service’ but denied that they lacked resources to tackle the problem. A spokesman for the authority said: ‘We do have regular patrols to monitor parking in the town. But it is not always possible to witness and take action against every example of bad or illegal parking. ‘Any public support and awareness for considerate parking can only be a good thing and if people wish to report incidents like this they can call us.’ Deputy council leader Stephen Ardley said: ‘We do provide a seven-day-a-week parking inspector service and we have issued almost 1,000 charge notices for various car parking offences. ‘There is concern and we are urging everybody to drive and park legally with consideration for others.’ But not everyone agrees with the campaign - one irate Facebook comment said: ‘He should go out and get a life.’ This driver didn't quite manage to make it into the space and found their car posted on the Facebook page .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Shrouded in five acres of sprawling fields, this country manor seems to be an isolated retreat cut off from the outside world. But in reality, it is the commuting countryside-dweller's dream. For at the foot of the rambling garden is a railway track - with a 'halt' to stop passing trains. Idyllic: This five-bedroom stone manor in Snowdonia National Park, Wales, comes complete with a Victorian-era railway to the seaside village of Tywyn. It is set behind woodland garden but the house looks like the picture of isolation shrouded in five acres of fields. It takes in views from Cardigan Bay too as the plains remain untouched . Bonus: Would-be buyers of this £425,000 country manor are at least half a mile from the nearest train stations in either direction, but get this private Talyllyn Railway at the foot of the garden that has 42 trains pass through it every week at high season - 30 in the winter. But you'll have to flag them down as there's no platform . The five-bedroom stone house, now on the market for £425,000, is set in the heart of Snowdonia National Park in Wales - half a mile from the nearest train stations. But with the Victorian-era Talyllyn Railway running across their land, would-be buyers need not worry about driving the distance. A winding footpath from the house leads through woodland and a valley to the property's halt. The 42 steam trains that pass by each . week on a heritage railway line can be waved down by the owners - who . can also request it to stop there when getting off. Services run between the former slate mining town of Abergynolwyn to the seaside village of Tywyn. The halt is called Tynllwyn-Hen - Old Tynllwyn in Welsh - which is named after the house that dates back to the 17th century and began life as a farm. It was created around 1900 to serve the farm and is simply marked by a small signpost next to the railway track. Quaint: Potential buyers will have sprawling views of the Welsh countryside from their homely room, where the current owners have lived since 1975 . Fully equipped: It seems to have the best of everything, boasting privacy and transport, as well as a reception hall, kitchen and breakfast room, and conservatory . The house that now stands on the property was once two cottages that were made into one property in the 1970s. It boasts a reception hall, a kitchen and breakfast room, conservatory, sitting room, drawing room and a utility room. It also has a stone barn which has been converted into a studio, workshops, stables and stores. The house is being sold by the family of Tim and Jill Winterton, who have owned it since 1975, through estate agents Strutt and Parker. Daughter Shane Flutter, who grew up in the house with her brother and two sisters, said: 'It was the most magical place to enjoy a childhood. 'At the bottom of the fields in the valley is the railway and there is a small halt there. 'Any time people came to stay we would go down to the railway and jump on the train up to the Dolgogh waterfalls nearby or up to Abergynolwyn. 'It was just a case of flagging down passing trains as they approached the halt. 'Nowadays it is our children who have been enjoying the railway. Historic: Originally a farm, the Victorian-era railway, Talyllyn Railway, was used by neighbouring farmers in the 1800s to get to the seaside town of Tywyn . Connected: Owners simply have to flag down trains to get to and from their retreat to busy towns - endless entertainment for the current owners' children . 'The house means so much to our family but we have all moved away and it has become too much to look after.' Malcolm Wood, secretary of the Railway Heritage Trust, said that halts were the forerunners to full-blown train stations and served rural communities. He said: 'People would stand at the halt and hail approaching trains which would stop to pick them up. 'Likewise, if you were on the train you pre-warned the guard that you wanted to alight at a particular halt. 'Once very much a feature of Britain’s railways, some halts from the early 20th century still exist, and still operate on the request system. 'But they are not very common these days, and it is quite unusual to find a halt in such simple form adjacent to a private house.' Belinda Hutchinson-Smith, from Strutt and Parker, said: 'This house has one of the most beautiful views imaginable embracing both the Cardigan Bay and the hills of Snowdonia. 'You can really feel its been a much loved family home and there is a wonderful feel of timelessness about it. 'There can be few houses which enjoy the novelty of its own private halt from where you can wave down the steam train which travels up and down the valley.'","Five-bedroom house in Snowdonia National Park, Wales, has Victorian-era railway behind woodland garden .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Found dead: Dawn Wigglesworth's body was found hanging above her cousin after an alleged sex game gone wrong. Mark Pickford was today cleared of her killing . A man who was accused of killing his cousin in a sex game after he was found curled up under her hanging dead body has been cleared. Police found Mark Pickford asleep in Dawn Warburton's blood-stained bed. The mother-of-two, who lived in Hull, Yorkshire, was hanging by neck above him, naked, with a number of injuries to her face and arms. A jury heard Mr Pickford, from Longsight in Manchester, had exchanged a string of violent and sexual texts with his 40-year-old cousin in the weeks before her death - one of which read: 'You're getting tied up, I will treat you like a random victim, gonna do you Manchester style.' Prosecutors at his trial accused Mr Pickford of assault and manslaughter because he breached his 'duty of care' towards Miss Warburton during a sex game. The 41-year-old denied the charges, saying he had blacked out after drinking and taking drugs, and could not remember anything for five hours before police woke him up in bed. He said he had only ever had 'ordinary sex' with his cousin and that he had sent the violent texts while drunk to 'be a lad'. After almost eight hours of deliberation, the jury at Hull Crown Court found him not guilty. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said the case had been 'unpleasant and disagreeable' for all involved while thanking the jurors for the verdict. The court was told how Miss Warburton . and Mr Pickford had been out of touch for around a year before she sent . him a text in March last year to say: 'How's tricks cuz?' After exchanging a few more messages, talk turned to sex. Mr Pickford was found at his cousin's house in Hull, Yorkshire, curled asleep under her body by police . One exchange saw Miss Warburton write: 'I scare myself the sort of dirty sex I'm into. It would warp your mind.' Mr Pickford then began to travel 100 miles from Longsight to her home in the Avenues area of Hull every week for sex. He told the court that, during the final time in April, he believes Miss Warburton may have drugged him with diazepam which 'knocked him out' until police arrived. He added he had not engaged in sexual games with her before she died. Her body was found on April 13 by a neighbour, from below, who went to investigate water dripping through her ceiling.","Mark Pickford, 41, was lying under Dawn Warburton's dead body .

"By . Caroline Graham . and Jo Knowsley . Fish is off the menu at Downton Abbey after ‘dinners’ served up for the TV series left the stately home reeking – and the actors feeling distinctly queasy. Mrs Patmore would no doubt be scandalised but the meals masquerading as fish, camouflaged with white sauce, are now sculpted pieces of chicken fillet which pass muster onscreen without leaving any lingering and distinctive odour. Julian Fellowes, the show’s creator, has been keen that costumes, props and even the food are as historically accurate as possible. Fowl play: Lord Grantham and Lady Mary tuck in to chicken disguised as fish using white sauce and mushrooms . But when real fish was served in the first series, the cast became nauseous, and the rooms were left stinking, according to Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham. ‘In the first season, when we had fish it really was fish,’ he said. ‘But if you put fish on the table at 8am when you start shooting it doesn’t smell so good in a few hours. 'It was pretty bad, especially when we were shooting in summer, with the windows blacked out, pretending it was night. 'The combination got pretty heady by mid-afternoon. It was queasy. Since the first season, no clear shots of fish have appeared after the genuine meals left rooms stinking . Makeover: Food stylist Lisa Heathcote has a menu of food that is historically accurate but mild in smell . ‘Our food consultant is very clever about how she disguises “fish”. It always looks and tastes delicious, but it isn’t the dish the audience thinks we’re eating. It’s chicken.’ Lisa Heathcote, Downton’s food stylist, conceded she used a range of tricks to enable the food to taste good, stay fresh, and look appetising. ‘The food must be appealing to the eye, historically accurate and well behaved. After all, the actors have to eat it,’ she said. Late night filming was particularly smelly as they were forced to keep the windows shut . ‘The fish incidents did happen, but outside my watch – I’ve been working with food and filming for too long to ever use real fish. 'I prepare “chicken fish” – chicken fillets covered in white sauce with mushrooms – to look like fish fillets, and “cheesy fish” – cream cheese, cottage cheese and Marie Rose sauce and lemon – to replicate the salmon mousse that was so popular once Daisy worked out how to use the food mixer.’ All the food eaten by the servants is real, too, with Lisa using Mrs Beeton’s Household Management and Mrs Marshall’s cookery books. ‘Downstairs characters have more simple fare, but it’s all real,’ says Lisa.","Fish dishes taken off menu after making rooms smell and cast nauseous .

"By . Gemma Mullin . A greedy dolphin called Monty choked to death after bingeing on fish. The animal was found stranded on a beach in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. Marine experts said its stomach was crammed full of fish - with one lodged in its nasal passages - and died of asphyxiation. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A post-mortem being carried out on the bottle nosed dolphin on Hell's Mouth beach . A post-mortem was carried out after the bottle-nosed dolphin was found on Hell’s Mouth beach in Llanengan, near Abersoch. The dolphin had been tagged by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre and was known as Monty. Rod Penrose, strandings co-ordinator for Wales, who helped carry out the post mortem said: 'Its stomach was crammed full of fish, and I don’t think there would have been room for any more. 'So when it swallowed this last fish, it must have been pushed back, rolled into a cigar shape and unusually then lodged firmly in the nasal passages.' He added: 'I’ve heard of this happening before but have never seen it. The greedy dolphin, known as Monty, was found with a whole dab fish in its nasal passages . 'In scientific terms it died of asphyxiation.' The experts from the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) teams, a department within the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Marine Environmental Monitoring described the findings of the post-mortem as ‘unusual’. They found almost a whole dab fish lodged within the inner part of the nasal cavity, almost blocking the airspace, which would have prevented the dolphin from breathing. The team, who visited the beach last Tuesday, said: 'An adult male bottlenose dolphin was reported stranded on Saturday, May 3, at Hell’s Mouth beach. 'A CSIP team from the Marine Environmental Monitoring attended the stranding site and secured the body from the inter-tidal zone and a field necropsy was carried out. 'The 3.34 metre adult male was in good nutritional condition, had worn teeth and had probably alive when it became stranded, prior to death. 'The cardiac stomach was distended with a large amount of recently ingested flatfish and a nearly intact flatfish was also found lodged within the inner part of the nasal cavity, completely blocking the airspace, which would have effectively prevented breathing. 'This unusual finding was considered to be the most significant during the post-mortem and the provisional cause of death has been given as asphyxiation. 'A range of samples were transported back to ZSL, including some for follow up bacteriological, histopathological and toxicological examinations.' Experts were able to identify Monty by matching marks on his dorsal fin to images in their photo ID catalogue . Researchers at the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre’s were able to identify the animal by matching marks on its dorsal fin to images in their photo ID catalogue. Sarah Perry, science officer, said: 'We know that Monty spent time in the southern part of Cardigan Bay in the summer and autumn of 2011. 'We also know from two photographs taken of Monty four months apart that he was involved in a fight at that time, because the second photo shows teeth marks on his fin that weren’t there in the first. These marks were a key feature we used to identify Monty.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES BELOW .

"By . Gemma Mullin . Council bosses have threatened to rip up a pensioner’s flowerbed – because she didn’t get permission to grow plants in it. Rose Kay decided to brighten up the council-owned area opposite her flat with some wildflowers and herbs to smarten the neighbourhood in Tiverton, Devon. After a string of angry letters from environmental service officers and a site visit from a senior council boss she was told to remove them, otherwise they will be ripped out for her. Rose Kay with the council-owned flowerbed where she planted a mix of herbs and wildflowers opposite her flat in Devon . Mrs Kay, who has lived at the flat for four years, said: ‘I just thought it was a nice thing for the residents and no one seemed to mind it. ‘Most of the flowers I’ve planted are wild so they are in keeping with the look of the area. I like to help nature along because it encourages the bees and birds.’ She said the problems began in September after a neighbour complained about a set of table and chairs she had set up in the area so people could sit out and enjoy the sun. But the council accused the move as ‘intimidating’ and told her to get rid of them too. ‘I put them there so people around the community could sit there and use it. ‘The council said I could sit there but I can’t leave them there so we removed them and put them in the garage,’ said Mrs Kay, who moved to the area from Lancashire in 1996. The area where the flowers have been planted (circled) surrounds a sapling on a strip of grass . She has received five letters from Adrian Cook, head of open spaces at Mid Devon District Council, and Paul Williams, its head of environmental services, insisting that she remove the plants. The most recent, from Mr Williams, said: ‘It is council land and there is no permission to exclusively ""use"" it for benefit, nor would permission be forthcoming. ‘The buildings were built without private gardens and open space provided as a buffer to the built environment. ‘If, when the grass team arrives to cut the grass, the plants are still there, they will be instructed to remove them.’ Mrs Kay said: ‘I’m so disappointed because I’m retired and my husband works long shifts so it’s my little area of sanctuary.’ However, Mr Williams, from the council has said that the authority is not prepared to let people use its land without permission. He said: ‘The resident was told that it was a green open space and not to be used by individuals as tended gardens. ‘There is also clearly insufficient land for every flat to have a piece of the open space as a garden which is why it is open space.’ He added: ‘Not all residents are happy with the arrangement that this resident has taken upon herself - without any permission - and the council is not prepared to have adverse possession of its land. ‘Mrs Kay has been told to remove the table and chairs and the plants and restore the council’s land to its original condition.’ Mr Williams added that Mrs Kay was asked to identify an area she thought would be ‘non-intrusive to other residents’ and also told of the possibility of allotments in the area, however, he said nothing has been forthcoming. The pensioner has started a petition . which 22 neighbours have signed in favour of keeping her plants – but is . resigned to having them removed.","Rose Kay planted the flowers in a council-owned plot opposite her flat .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A British woman died in Cyprus after doctors failed to spot her ectopic pregnancy. Kalisha Gordon, 21, was working on the party resort of Ayia Napa when nurses revealed she was expecting her first child with her boyfriend of two years. But just days later Miss Gordon - who had planned to fly home to tell her parents the good news - began to experience severe stomach cramps and vomiting. Tragic: Kalisha Gordon, 21, was about to fly home from Cyrus to tell her parents she was pregnant when she was hit with stomach cramps and died hours later. Doctors failed to spot her ectopic pregnancy . She was left 'screaming in pain' and was rushed to hospital but doctors failed to spot all the hallmark signs of an ectopic pregnancy - where a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb. Instead they told her the baby was fine and gave her painkillers - but she was found unconscious on the floor of her hospital room and tragically died six hours later. Today, a coroner issued a damning verdict on the medical attention she received in Cyprus. The inquest heard her ultrasounds were taken at 'an inappropriate angle' which may have skewed the doctors' findings. Coroner Katy Skerrett said: 'At no stage was the ectopic pregnancy diagnosed and at no stage was she treated for it. 'The first stage they were aware of the ectopic pregnancy was when the post mortem was carried out. 'There was a failure to diagnose and a failure to treat an ectopic pregnancy by medical authorities approached by Kalisha. 'This was a tragic accident that was entirely avoidable.' Gloucester Coroner’s Court heard Miss Gordon had moved to Cyprus in June 2008 to hand out flyers in the Mediterranean town famed for its nightlife. On July 22 she went to a local doctor’s surgery after taking a positive pregnancy test, where she was told to return after a few days for an ultrasound. Inquest: Gloucester Coroner’s Court heard Miss . Gordon had moved to Cyprus in June 2008 to hand out flyers in the . Mediterranean town famed for its nightlife when she died in hospital . The scan on July 26 revealed she was seven weeks pregnant and Dr Petros Afxentiou told the mother-to-be she was healthy. Miss Gordon, of Tuffley, Gloucester, quickly booked tickets to return home to tell her parents she was expecting her first child with boyfriend Daniel Douglas. But the day before the flight, on July 29, the 'bright and bubbly' young woman fell ill with severe vomiting, chest pain and began to faint regularly. In a statement read to the inquest, Rachel Cotter, a friend who was with Miss Gordon at the time, said: 'At around 5pm Kalisha suddenly said she started to feel cramps and began to scream in pain. 'We drove her straight to the doctors, on the way she vomited at least five times. 'She was screaming in pain in the surgery, she kept asking if the baby was ok. 'The doctor gave her an injection and telephoned for a taxi which took her to hospital.' The inquest heard it took three hours until an ultrasound was carried out, at 9.15pm, where Dr Afxentiou once more said the baby was fine. Miss Gordon continued to faint throughout the evening and told nurses she was feeling dizzy with severe stomach pain, but they continued to give her painkillers. A ward worker eventually found her unconscious on the floor of her room at 11pm where she was rushed to the intensive care unit. At 2.30am on July 30, she died. Grieving: Lloyd and Jane Gordon were initially told their daughter died of a heart attack . Bubbly: Friends told the inquest in Gloucester that Kalisha (right) was 'bright and bubbly' and loved Cyprus . Her devastated family were initially told . Miss Gordon had died of a heart attack. It was not until the post . mortem days later that they learned of the ectopic pregnancy. The court was told that an inquest was carried out in Cyprus in 2012 where expert witnesses found a number of failings and breaches of care had occurred. Adam Magos, a consultant gynaecologist at the Royal Free Hospital, London, said he found a number of errors in the way the ultrasounds had been taken and the care given to Miss Gordon. In a statement read to the court he said: 'She had several symptoms and signs which suggested for a possible report of ectopic pregnancy. 'She was known to be in the early stages of pregnancy, she was complaining of abdominal pain and had fainted for no obvious reason a number of times.' He said the ultrasound scan took place at an 'inappropriate angle or corner' which allowed a normal pregnancy to be diagnosed. Miss Gordon was working in the party resort of Ayia Napper, Cyprus. At the hospital where she died a ward worker found her . unconscious on the floor of her room at 11pm and she died at 2.30am . 'This must have been incorrect, no fetal activity was seen on the scan, the doctor identified it in error,' he told the inquest. 'Steps should have been taken to determine the cause of the reported fainting.' Speaking after the inquest Kalisha’s father Lloyd George said it had taken the family six years to finally get the truth about their daughter’s death. He said: 'The doctors messed up six years ago and we have had to fight for the answers. 'We had to battle hard for the first three years just to get an inquest into her death. 'Our aim is to stop anything like this happening again, the Cypriot authorities aren’t listening to us. 'Nothing will bring Kalisha back but if we can stop any family going through this like us we will . 'There were serious failings, she was in hospital for six hours and no one diagnosed it. It needs to be seriously looked at.' He added the family had approached the European Court of Human Rights with a specially hired Cypriot lawyer to get justice for Miss Gordon.","Kalisha Gordon, 21, fell pregnant with boyfriend of 2 years in Ayia Napa .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A British salesman is set to become one of the world's richest men after selling his contact lens business for £700 million. Alan Wells set up an opticians in Twickenham, south west London, in 1985 when he noticed contact lenses becoming something of a trend. Within 10 years, Sauflon Pharmaceuticals was thriving, with factories in London, Kent and Hungary. Now, despite keeping a low profile for 29 years, Mr Wells has become an icon of British business, sealing a deal with U.S. firm Cooper Vision for $1.2 billion. Thriving: Alan Wells set up an opticians in . Twickenham, south west London, in 1985 when he noticed contact lenses . becoming something of a trend and now his firm has become Sauflon Pharmaceuticals . Adding an estimated £280 million to his . fortune, the father-of-three will now be one of the world's richest men - . possibly ranking above the £210 million Beckham family in the Sunday . Times Rich List. Describing his ascent in 2010, he told Contact Lens Monthly: 'Throughout my career my motivation has been fear of failure. 'With our products we have the tiger by the tail. I honestly believe we have the best contact lens in the world.' The firm was set up just 10 years after disposable lenses were invented by British optometrist Dr Rishi Agarwal. Originally, Sauflon exclusively sold aftercare solution. But . in 1998, the industry had a breakthrough with the advent of the more . comfortable silicone hydrogel lenses - and Mr Wells was keen to get . involved. Market leader: The firm, Sauflon, now has the widest product range in the industry, providing to eyecare practitioners such as Specsavers. Selling it, Mr Wells is set to take £280 million from his 40 per cent stake . It was a move that would see the pharmaceutical company dominate the industry, with the widest product range on the market. And to his delight, Mr Wells's three sons - Gary, Bradley and David - have followed him into the business. Success story: Alan Wells is now signing a £1.2 billion deal with a leading U.S. pharmaceutical company . One of just four companies in the world to manufacture both lenses and aftercare, Sauflon products are now sold in 50 countries around the world. The . group also has operations in Southampton, home to a research and . development team and one of Sauflon's state-of-the-art contact lens . production facilities which produces more than 100 million contact . lenses each year. Finally selling the firm, Mr Wells is slated to take £280 million from his 40 per cent shares, though it could be lower as the figure includes debts. His sons are also set to benefit from the exchange. Although the disposable contact lens . market . is a booming business in the UK and Europe, the industry has lagged in . the United States - and this sale is hailed as key to its growth. Robert . S. Weiss, Cooper's president and chief executive officer, said, 'We are . extremely pleased to announce this acquisition which gives CooperVision . the world's most comprehensive portfolio of daily disposable lenses. 'CooperVision . will now be able to offer a multi-tier daily strategy that includes a . full suite of silicone hydrogel and hydrogel lenses, including options . within all categories -- spheres, torics and multifocals. 'The . daily segment is the fastest growing segment of the soft contact lens . market and this transaction positions CooperVision as the premier . company in this space.'

He then took to illegal trade website Black Market Reloaded with 25 firearms up for sale. Jailed: John Yelland, 28, tried to sell 25 sub-machine guns on the black market after serving in Afghanistan. He has now been jailed for six years after being arrested at work . The RAF Senior Aircraftsman, who served in Afghanistan, also set up his own website in a bid to sell a range of Tasers, batons and pepper spray. And his wife was jailed for helping ferry a gun over to his RAF base. Jailing him for six years, the judge at Norwich Crown Court condemned Yelland's 'sinister' actions that he appeared to 'relish'. Yelland, based at RAF Marham, Norfolk, had become increasingly 'paranoid and isolated' after returning from tours in Cyprus, Norfolk and Qatar. He was arrested at work after a parcel was intercepted. He ordered the package to go to his mother-in-law's address in County Durham - though she was uninvolved in the scam. She immediately forwarded the parcel to his RAF base, but it was spotted by mailing staff in Tyneside, County Durham. The package contained a Taurus self-loading pistol and three magazines - one of which contained an illegal dummy bullet. Raiding his home, Norfolk Police and RAF Police seized two laptops, a stun gun and pepper spray in a joint operation. Caught: He was arrested at work in RAF Marham, Norfolk, after this gun was intercepted in the post . They also arrested his now-estranged . wife Maimie, 25, who has been jailed for making a 60-second phone call . to her mother warning her to forward the incriminating parcel. Yesterday, . Yelland admitted two counts of attempting to sell prohibited weapons, . possession of a prohibited weapon and attempting to possess a prohibited . weapon. He also admitted . attempting to manufacture a prohibited weapon, two further counts of . possessing prohibited weapons and one of possessing ammunition without a . firearms certificate. Judge . Anthony Bate condemned his actions, telling him he was a 'trusted' individual who was highly regarded and utilised for 'high profile . visits' to the base. Judge Bate told Yelland: 'You gave no indication to anyone else at that station to the dark side of your character. 'It’s plain in my view from the postings on the dark web that you appeared to relish dealing with like-minded individuals. The messages all had sinister undertones.' He said Yelland appeared to enjoy the 'technical challenge' of building sub machine guns. Help: His wife Maimie, 25, has also been jailed after the parcel was sent to her mother and she called to get her to forward it . Yelland will also be banned from using an encrypted communication device and have tightly-restricted internet access. His . estranged wife Maimie appeared alongside him and admitted transferring . criminal property in relation to a call she made to her mother asking . her to send the pistol. Jailing . her for six months, Judge Bate said anyone who plays a part, however . brief, in the movement of a firearm must expect a 'robust' punishment to . 'deter others'. Susannah Stevens, defending Yelland, said he had done 'incredibly well' in the RAF. But Miss Stevens said it started to go wrong in 2010 when he was transferred to Cyprus and had to work under 'difficult conditions' due to lack of resources. She said Yelland asked for help as he was worried about his mental state, began to feel increasingly isolated and depressed, and was bullied because he has a stutter. 'It doesn’t take a genius to work out some of the unpleasant sights he would have had to have dealt with,' added Miss Stevens. She said Yelland was almost run over near an air base in Qatar and saw a man blown up in front of him in a rocket attack. Miss Stevens added that when he returned to RAF Marham he became increasingly 'paranoid and isolated'. She said there was further concern about Yelland after the barbaric murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013. Miss Stevens said he had suffered such a devastating fall from grace that he had 'lost everything', including his career, 'his name, his reputation, but also his relationship with his wife'. Neil Guest, defending Maimie Yelland, said she was in a 'traumatic position' of thinking her mother might be arrested after being sent the gun. 'She didn’t have time for mature thought,' added Mr Guest. 'It was a knee jerk reaction.' Last night Ch Supt Nick Davison, of Norfolk Police, said it was good to see Yelland behind bars. He said: 'Yelland thought nothing of making and storing the weapons and it is pleasing to see this man behind bars with a lengthy custodial sentence.'","John Yelland, 28, tried to sell 25 sub-machine guns, Tasers, pepper spray .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Four young children, including a baby and twin girls, died after a fire broke out in their Philadelphia home in the early hours of Saturday - and now officials are looking into the possibly that the deadly blaze was caused by a firecracker. The fire, which started just before 3am, destroyed eight rowhouses and spread to a further 10, effectively wiping out an entire city block and leaving an estimated 42 people homeless. The mother of two of the victims had tried desperately to save the children - her four-year-old twin daughters, a one-month-old boy, and a boy, also aged four - but was beaten back by the flames. Scroll down for video . Pink ladies: Maria and Marialla Bowah, age 4, known in their neighborhood for their pink outfits, were among the four children who perished in a devastating Philadelphia fire . Crushing loss: Patrick Sanyeah, four, and Taj Jacque, who was born in May, succumbed to the fire while their mother was away . Heartbroken: A woman believed to be Eleanor Jacque, the mother of the two dead boys, sobs outside the row of fire-ravaged houses . Devastating: Four young children, including a baby boy, died when a fire ripped through this row of houses . Tragic: Fire crews inspect one of the houses destroyed by the blaze, which killed four and left 42 homeless . The children were named Saturday afternoon as twins Maria and Marialla Bowah, Patrick Sanyeah, four, and Taj Jacque, who was born in May. The children were part of a group of 10 people staying at the home of the twins' mother, Dewen Bowah. Bowah, a mother of seven, had managed to get her other three daughters out of the house, but the intense blaze stopped her reaching the four victims. The 41-year-old had to jump from a second-story window to escape the blaze along with the tree girls identified as Naomi, Julie and Julisa Bowah. Five of those who escaped from the house had to be treated for smoke inhalation, including two under the age of 13. Dewen Bowah was taken to a hospital in critical condition. The victims were found in a front bedroom on the second floor of the house. The boys' mother, 23-year-old Eleanor Jacque, was not home at the time of the fire, Philly.com reported. Intense: Firefighters use a chainsaw to try to break into a building and douse the flames . Blaze: About 100 firefighters helped tackle the fire, which spread to eight homes joined by wooden porches . Fast: The blaze broke out in the early hours of Saturday, and spread quickly to neighboring properties . Sawyer told CNN: 'This is a tragic, tragic day for the city of Philadelphia. Tragic.' Neighbor . Jaka Kaba, whose house was damaged by the fire, said the young victims, . whose names have not been released, were loved on the street. 'I . knew them. Everyone knew them. They were good children. They didn't . deserve this. No one expects this. It's hurting everyone,' she told Philly.com. Abu Marrah told NBC Philadelphia the Bowah twins were sweet girls who loved wearing everything pink, earning them the nickname 'Pink Ladies' from him. The neighbor said Maria and Marialla were inseparable and were usually seen playing outdoors. ‘When you see one of them, you see the other,’ Marrah added. Bereaved mother: Eleanor Jacque, 23, pictured left with her son Patrick and his younger brother Taj (right), both of whom were killed Saturday . Just hours before the tragedy, Lorine Kamara saw the little girls and 4-year-old Patrick Sanyeah together on the sidewalk outside the row houses. ‘They were just playing and that's the last memory I have of them,’ said the neighbor. When it . was first reported, the fire was centered on three of the row houses, . but it quickly moved to the surrounding properties which were linked by . wooden porches. Early investigations suggest that the fire may have started on a couch that was on one of the porches. Saturday afternoon, witnesses came forward claiming they heard firecrackers explode just moments before the flames ignited at 2.45am. Support: Friends and neighbors form a circle outside the row of damaged houses to pray for the victims . Fire crews stand on the remains of a rooftop after the early morning blaze destroyed eight homes . It took about 100 firefighters to put out the 3-alarm blaze, which was said to be under control at 4.17am. When fire crews first arrived, they said the fire was burning intensely in four homes. The heat from the blaze melted parts of cars parked along the street and damaged properties on the other side of the road. Jeff Boone told Philly.com he had been playing video games when he stepped outside his house and saw a couch on fire on the neighbor's porch. 'It looked like someone had a flamethrower and just shot it all across,' he said, as he described watching the fire spread to other properties. After getting his niece outside, Boone said he ran up and down the street trying to wake the neighbors. 'I was running, screaming, telling everybody, ""Get up! Yo, get yo! Go!"". The flames was just so intense, I couldn't see nothing from the smoke.' He added: 'I hear the little kids upstairs screaming.' Ruined: Fire crew inspect the damage caused to the row of houses in Philadelphia . The intensity of the fire caused roofs to collapse and walls to blister . Fire crews begin the clean up operation after hours of fighting the blaze . Another neighbor, Milton Musa, said that as they ran to safety they saw two young children trying to escape from a window. 'I was afraid they'd fall to the cement. So I went underneath them, let them fall on my back and carried them away,' he said. Musa, whose house was destroyed in the blaze, said: 'Everyone was running for their live. I've lost everything. My paperwork, my documents, my house. Everything.' On Saturday afternoon, friends and neighbors gathered outside the row of damaged houses and held hands as they remembered the victims. 'We lost four precious lives. Four little, innocent children, in a horrific tragedy,' Mayor Anthony Nutter said at a press conference about the fire. A shelter for the 42 residents displaced by the fire has been set up at a nearby high school. It is not yet clear what started the blaze, but an investigation has been started. Some neighbors have suggested that a firecracker could be to blame. Firefiighters clamber through the roof of one of the burnt out houses which lost its windows in the fire .

"By . David Williams . Bomber: Marian McGlinchey admitted buying a mobile phone linked to a Real IRA attack in which two British soldiers died . Old Bailey bomber Marian McGlinchey yesterday admitted buying a mobile phone linked to a Real IRA attack in which two British soldiers died. The 59-year-old was caught on CCTV buying the device – which was then used by the terror group to claim responsibility for an attack on the Massereene Army barracks in 2009. Royal Engineer sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were shot dead by gunmen as they stepped outside their compound in Antrim to collect a pizza from two delivery men. Two other soldiers and two civilians were wounded when more than 60 shots were fired from a car at the servicemen, who were wearing desert fatigues and were due to be deployed to Afghanistan the next day. In a dramatic change of plea, McGlinchey – also known as Marian Price – yesterday pleaded guilty to providing property for the purposes of terrorism. Prosecutors told Belfast Crown Court that the pay-as-you-go handset she bought at a Tesco in Belfast had been provided ‘solely’ for the purposes of the dissident Republican Real IRA. The court heard that the phone was first used an hour and five minutes after it was bought. The following day an unknown man made a number of calls to media outlets, said prosecutor Tessa Kitson. McGlinchey, who helped carry out the 1973 IRA car bomb attack on London’s Old Bailey courthouse, must have known the phone would be used to ‘promote the objectives and aims of a terrorist organisation’ because of her ‘background and involvement in dissident republican activity’, Miss Kitson said. Victims: Sappers Patrick Azimkar (left) and Mark Quinsey died after more than 60 rounds were fired at them as they stepped out to collect a pizza . McGlinchey, from Belfast, also changed her plea and admitted a second charge of aiding and abetting a meeting to encourage support for terrorism. She was filmed holding a piece of paper for a masked man at a rally in Londonderry in 2011, at which he issued threats against Catholic police officers. McGlinchey, who was returned to prison the same year on the direction of the then Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, was released on bail and will be sentenced next month. McGlinchey and her sister Dolours Price were arrested at Heathrow hours after they were involved in placing bombs outside the Old Bailey in 1973. One man died of a heart attack and more than 200 people were injured. Later they both went on hunger strike in their battle to be transferred from jail in  England to Northern Ireland. In the 1990s they became fierce critics of Sinn Féin and its president, Gerry Adams, calling his peace strategy a sell-out.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Police responding to calls of a strange creature roaming the streets in Michigan on Wednesday discovered more than 30 exotic animals in a garage. Lemus, coatis, an owl and other animals that can be kept only with a license were found in 'deplorable' conditions, living in small cages. Detroit Zoo has taken in the assortment of exotic animals which are said to be healthy despite how they were being kept. Private zoo: Police called to reports of a strange creature on the loose found a coati, top, living in a garage with ring-tailed lemurs . Unexpected: Police discovered an array of exotic animals living at this house in Michigan . The unexpected discovery was made after neighbors reported seeing a coati - a South American animal similar to the racoon - roaming around on lawns. 'We responded thinking that the odds ... were pretty slim, but they turned out to be credible,'  Deputy Police Commissioner Louis Galasso told Detroit News. The owner of the animals, who has not been identified, was at work when police called to say they had found his coati. He told police that he didn't realize he needed an exotic pet license to keep the animals, and that he had been due to clean their enclosures on the day the coati escaped. Police removed his animals, which included two white-nosed coatis, two ring-tailed lemurs, three fennec foxes and a screech owl. Rehomed: One of two ring-tailed lemurs who were found living in cages in a garage . More than 30 animals including lemurs and owls were removed from the garage . Concerns: Detroit zoo officials said the animals, including this fennec fox, were kept in 'deplorable' conditions . The creatures are currently in quarantine at Detroit Zoo, which has stepped in before to take over the care of exotic animals. Elizabeth Arbaugh, curator of mammals at the zoo, said they appeared to be in good health but the 'conditions these animals were being kept in were deplorable'. Zoo director Ron Kagan said: 'Privately owned exotic animals kept as 'pets' often end up in compromised conditions and in need of rescue.' He added that the zoo has worked with Michigan Humane Society to try to get legislation passed to bar such animals being kept. Police said they plan to seek charges against the animals' owner for allegedly having dangerous and wild animals, and for animal cruelty. Each charge has a 90-day prison sentence or $500 fine. A fund has been set up by the zoo to help pay for the animals' care. Escapee: A coatimundi peers over a tarpaulin after breaking loose from its garage enclosure .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Loss: Finance student Michael Deng died from head injuries during a hazing . More than 30 members of a New York fraternity are expected to be charged over the death of a 19-year-old student during a hazing in December. Michael Deng, who was a freshman at Baruch College in New York City, died from serious head injuries after taking part in a ritual at a rented house in Pennsylvania. His fellow students are accused of waiting for about an hour and a half before taking the unconscious teenager to hospital. Investigators claimed that before Deng died he was blindfolded and had been trying to carry a heavy backpack while members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity hit him on December 9, last year. Instead of rushing him straight to hospital, the fellow students are accused of changing his clothes and searching the internet for information about head injuries. A coroner ruled that the death was a homicide, and that Deng died from blunt force head trauma. Police say that several of the students involved in the hazing, which took place in Tunkhannock Township, could face homicide charges. Their names have not been released. Ponoco Mountain police chief Harry Lewis told the New York Times that under Pennsylvania law homicide covers everything from involuntary manslaughter, which could mean a year in prison, to premeditated murder. Claims: About 30 Baruch College students are expected to be charged in connection with the hazing death . Ritual: Deng was allegedly blindfolded and forced to carry a backpack while members of Pi Delta Psi hit him at a rental property in Tunkannock Township . The students are also expected to be charged with hazing, which is a misdemeanor crime. Chief .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . IBM has set a culinary challenge for its multimillion-dollar supercomputer Watson, which has been programmed to tantalize taste buds. A joint initiative between the tech company and food magazine Bon Appetit is trying to come up with new recipes by blending data on ingredients. The kitchen is new territory for Watson which so far has been used to win at Jeopardy and to work on a cure for cancer. Recipe for success: IBM's supercomputer Watson has been testing its culinary skills . Domestic science: IBM teamed up with Bon Appetit to see if the supercomputer could create new recipes . The cooking app - Chef Watson with Bon Appetit - works by using data the supercomputer has taken from more than 9,000 recipes. New combinations are then created by Watson, which analyzes data on the compounds in ingredients, and how frequently they are combined in different dishes. Tests so far have come up with some unusual, but delicious options such as a Bengali butternut BBQ sauce. Watson, which according to CNN cost IBM . an estimated $900 million to develop, came up with the unusual . combination after being asked to create an Indian sauce using butternut. The designers likened the process to 'watching an episode of Chopped in real time'. Combo: A food truck at the SXSW festival in Texas serves up treats based on data taken from thousands of different recipes . Challenge: The cooking test was new ground for Watson, which has previously been used in cancer research . 'You get a bunch of ingredients and then decide what to do with them. The difference here is that every ingredient you’re presented with already goes well together, even if you don’t know it yet,' they said. The combinations have excited and surprised the Bon Appetit team, who were curious about what creations Watson would deliver. Editor in chief Adam Rapoport told the Daily News: 'We . see the intersection of technology and food sparking new thinking and . creativity not only in our own test kitchen, but in our reader's homes . as well.' He added that Watson had the power to 'unleash a chef's creativity'. The magazine used Watson to help come up with new twists for July 4 barbecue favorite, and found that it came up with some interesting additions, but still needed the flair of a human cook to make the recipes work. The full results of Watson's July 4 . combo included fennel-spiced ribs with tangy apple-mustard barbecue . sauce, tamarind-cabbage slaw with crispy onions, and a blackberry-cherry . cobbler with honey whipped cream. New ground: IBM says its multi-million-dollar supercomputer is improved by such interactions as the food challenge . 'We’re always trying to find some sort of hook, or kicker for our recipes ... it’s very hard to reinvent the wheel,' food editor Dawn Perry said. With Watson however, 'you’re given the answer - the ingredient list - before you really know what questions to ask'. She said the process made her consider combinations she may never have come up with on her own, 'like the Chinese spicy mustard on the ribs ... or the marjoram in the berry cobbler'. For the IBM team, the cooking app offered another chance to test their supercomputer's capabilities. Senior vice-president Mike Rhodin said IMB wanted to 'to help people discover the potential of cognitive computing systems'. 'These systems can understand vast . amounts of data, compounds, and formulas as well as learn from . interactions with people and information, in a far more intuitive way,' he added.","IBM's Watson blends data from more than 9,000 recipes to offer new ideas .

"By . Matthew Blake . France's National Front descended into further disarray today after its founder threatened to expose his daughter and the party's leader for stabbing him in the back. Jean Marie Le Pen, who launched the right-wing party in 1972, accused his daughter Marine Le Pen of betraying him after the party pulled his video blog from the internet this week amid claims he made an anti-semitic quip. Police were also looking in to a 'mysterious' £800,000, reports last night indicated. Detective are looking at doantions to the National Front of more than one million euros, which Mr Le Pen insists are legitimate. Marine Le Pen (pictured, right, in 2011) said her father (left) had made a 'political error' but that the 'meaning given to his comments is a malicious interpretation' Le Pen . rebuked her father last weekend for what she called a 'political . mistake' after he used a term linked to the French word for 'oven' when . talking about a Jewish singer - a remark that critics said was an . implied reference to the death camps of the Holocaust. And now he is threatening to publish an . explosive letter he has written to her despite desperate pleas from . party chiefs to destroy it for fear that it could split the family and even the party, party insiders say. Today he claimed to have fallen victim of a conspiracy to freeze him out of the party, led by his own daughter. 'My daughter has stabbed me in the back,' he told Les Inrocks, a cultural magazine. 'If I get on their nerves, the only thing for them to do is to kill me. I’m not going to commit suicide.' In another . interview, with Le Monde, he grumbled that no one had contacted him . about the removal of his blog and that he wanted it reinstated. However, a source close to the National Front’s . leader, tole The Times newspaper that the patriarch’s anger was not based in politics. 'It’s . just jealousy,' the source said. 'He can’t stand the idea that she is doing better than he . ever did.' Firebrand: Jean-Marie Le Pen was criticised by Jewish groups and prominent members of his own party over the weekend for the comment made in a video posted on the National Front's website last Friday . The latest imbroglio to befall the far-right party was sparked at the weekend when M Le Pen made a ‘joke’ in . which he appeared to suggest that a popular French Jewish singer, . Patrick Bruel, should be put into an oven. Marine . Le Pen accused him of making a ‘political mistake’, and said the . incident gave her the opportunity ‘to remind people that the FN condemns any form of anti-Semitism in the strongest terms’. When asked about one of his party's critics - the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel (pictured) - Mr Le Pen said he would be part of a 'batch next time', while hinting at the word 'oven' While . Marine Le Pen said her father's comment had been misinterpreted, two . days later his blog and all links leading to it had been removed from . the National Front's official web site. Her . father then hit back by attacking Mlle Le Pen, 45, for turning the . party into a more mainstream organisation since taking the reins in 2011 . – a policy that led to huge success in the recent European elections, . when the Front National took first place in France with 25 per cent of . the vote. ‘I . consider that the serious political error is made by those who align . themselves with political correctness,’ the 85-year-old said. ‘They want . to be like the other parties.’ M . Le Pen had said Bruel would be part of ‘a batch [of critics] we will . get next time’ – using the word fournée for batch, evoking the word four . which means oven in French. M Le Pen was re-elected as an MEP in the elections, but . this did not stop him making a pun referring to the Nazi gas chambers . during World War II. In a . video posted on the FN website, and posted on YouTube, the 85-year-old . attacks a number of the party's critics, including pop star Madonna. When . asked about another - the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel - M Le Pen said . he would be part of a 'batch next time', while hinting at the word . 'oven'. Thousands of French Jews were sent to German concentration camps during the war, where most were murdered. A spokesman for SOS Racism, a leading . Paris civil rights group, described M Le Pen's pun as 'the worst kind . of anti-Semitic filth'. Le Pen is already facing a police corruption probe over the mysterious acquisition of more than €1 million, funds he says come from the reimbursement of debts and an inheritance.","Blog was removed after he implied Jewish singer should be baked in an oven .

"By . Matthew Blake . Detectives hunting for Madeleine McCann are preparing to send sniffer dogs into a shop where a suspect was spotted with a little girl on the day the three-year-old disappeared. Police sniffer dogs have been brought in to search areas of interest in Praia da Luz, from which Madeleine vanished in 2007. There were a number of sightings of a man carrying a child away from the holiday apartments where her family were staying and police are now focusing on a building between the resort and the beach which witnesses say the man and entered with the child, reports the Daily Mirror. Madeleine, then aged three, went missing from the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in May 2007 . Portuguese TV station SIC, which broke the news of the shop search, said: 'Other work is still to be confirmed, including searches in a commercial premises in Praia da Luz where someone is said to have seen a man with a child similar to Madeleine entering around the time of her disappearance,  a procedure which may require judicial authorisation unless approved by the owner of the premises.' It comes after four arguidos - or 'persons of interest' - were quizzed in Portugal on Tuesday as part of the latest stage of the Metropolitan Police’s multi-million-pound reinvestigation of the case. Officers from Operation Grange are believed to be using sniffer dogs to search the cars of two suspects quizzed earlier this week (it is not known if the men pictured are the ones having their vehicles inspected) Scotland Yard officers were present during the questioning of four men earlier this week at a police station in Faro (pictured) as part of a reinvestigation of Madeleine McCann's disappearance . None of the suspects have been identified by police though three are believed to be Portuguese while another is originally from Russia . The suspects are said to be three Portuguese nationals and Russian computer expert Sergey Malinka, whose Praia da Luz home was searched by police shortly after Madeleine went missing in May 2007. A spokesman for South Wales police told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that two South Wales Police specialist dog handlers, and victim detection dogs, have been deployed to assist with the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. 'The officers are working as part of a small team of team of British police officers, led by Metropolitan Police Service, in conjunction with the Portuguese authorities. 'They can be deployed in a wide a variety of locations such as buildings, open areas and vehicles.' According to the Daily Mirror, the animals will search cars belonging to two of the suspects being quizzed by officers from Operation Grange. The dogs, 7-year-old English Springer Spaniels named Tito and Muzzy, were used in the search for April Jones in 2012. The four men emerged as key suspects after analysis of mobile phone records suggested they were close to the scene of her disappearance when she went missing. Sniffer dogs were earlier used by officers to search waste ground near to the site where Madeleine vanished . Officers from Operation Grange scoured three sites in Praia da Luz but found no new evidence . All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens, while one is believed to be of Russian origin. They have all been summoned to be interviewed but there have been no arrests. In June, Portuguese and British police searched three sites in Praia da Luz but found no evidence relating to the case. Scotland Yard said at the time that ‘more activity’ had been agreed with Portuguese police and the searches were the ‘first phase’ of a major investigation. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the Metropolitan Police inquiry, was among those present at the interviews earlier this week. The new round of questioning comes less than three weeks after police dug up waste land near the Ocean Club where the McCann family were staying at the time of their daughter's disappearance. Officers inspected sewers using a hi-tech camera over nearly a fortnight in a grim search for Madeleine's body. The search and this week's police quizzes have happened at the request by Operation Grange detectives leading the British hunt for Madeleine. Scotland Yard are working on the theory burglars killed Madeleine during a bungled break-in while her parents ate tapas nearby with friends - and then buried her body on waste ground in the resort.","South Wales police have sent two victim detection dogs to Portugal .

"By . Matthew Blake . A waiter who claims he is the . illegitimate son of Spain's former king has lodged his claim in the . country's highest court in a bid to finally prove he is of royal blood. Alberto Sola, 58, whose adoptive parents are peasants from Catalonia, says his DNA matches that of Juan Carlos, 76, the monarch who abdicated the throne last month and allegedly bedded more than 1,500 women. His mother is said to have met the former king when she was 18 in the 1950s, six years before he married Sofia of Greece and Denmark and 20 years before he took the throne. Now the suit has been passed on to the . Supreme Court by a lower court where it had been under review in light . of controversial new legal protections for ex-king Juan Carlos, 76, who . lost his total immunity when he quit the throne last month. Royal blood? Alberto Sola, 58, (left) says his DNA matches that of Juan Carlos, the monarch who abdicated the throne in June . Juan Carlos automatically lost the . total immunity which he enjoyed during his 39-year reign when he . abdicated on June 18, leading lawmakers to rush in controversial new . legal protections for the ageing former monarch. Unlike his previous immunity, the new measures do not completely shield Juan Carlos. He . now must answer to Spain's highest court, the Supreme Court, which has a . high threshold for evidence, giving him similar protection enjoyed by . many high-ranking civil servants and politicians. The court will now have to decide whether it accepts the suit or shelves it. Affair? Sola claims that his birth mother, the daughter of a well-known Barcelona banker, may have had an affair with the king before he married Queen Sofia (pictured with Juan Carlos in June), which resulted in his birth . Mr Sola was born under the rule of dictator Francisco Franco ruled Spain, at a time when the country was extremely conservative and stringently Catholic. It meant babies that were born out of wedlock were frowned upon. Therefore he was taken to Ibiza as an infant before he moved in with his adoptive family in Barcelona. Despite claims to royal heritage, Sola now works in the humble environment of a restaurant in the town of La Bisbal near Girona. 'Don Juan': Juan Carlos is said to have bedded more than 1,500 women in a 'Don Juan-style' romantic career, that allegedly included Princess Diana (pictured together in 1987) According to The Sunday Times, he believed he had powerful links when a private helicopter arrived to pick him up during military service so he could visit his adoptive father. As a result, he began to send letters to the palace, demanding a meeting with his 'father', but he never received a reply. He told the paper: 'I've no choice now but to  put pressure on him. 'Every Spaniard has the right to know where he is from. I don't want to hurt the king or country. I wish Felipe all the best.' He got inspiration from Ingrid Saritau, who also claims the former Spanish king is her father. Ingrid says her mother Liliane Sartiau first met King Juan Carlos in 1956 in France and again in 1966 in Luxembourg where she was conceived. In 2012, she said: 'My mum told me who my father was while we were watching the TV together.' Her case is partly to blame for Spanish MPs signing legislation that would reinstate his immunity from prosecution, a right he lost when he gave up the throne to his son . Mr Sola believes the Spanish King, said to have bedded more than 1,500 women in a ‘Don Juan-style’ romantic career, met his birth mother during a trip to the Catalan capital in the fifties from a military academy in Zaragoza where he was studying. Barcelona-based author Pilar Eyre, made the explosive claim King Juan Carlos, 71, had an affair with Princess Diana in a book she published earlier this year. Another royal biographer, Lady Colin Campbell, has long insisted that the Princess and the King embarked on an affair while on a cruise with their spouses in August 1986. On July 2 Juan Carlos announced that he would hand over to his 46-year-old heir, Crown Prince Felipe.","Alberto Sola, 58, believes his DNA matches that of Spain's Juan Carlos .

Chord blood is blood taken from a baby's umbilical cord and contains embryonic stem cells. They can be made into more specialised cells and can reproduce copies of themselves almost indefinitely. There is currently research into a host of applications – from growing new organs to curing paraplegia. In theory, stem cells treat disease by replacing damaged or diseased cells. They are used in bone-marrow transplants to treat leukaemia – but in these cases, donor blood taken in the usual way is used to harvest the stem cells.

I was with him 24/7. His mum would always say we were like a married couple. 'He had a very close relationship with his mum and used to ring her every night to say, ‘I love you’. 'Lorraine will never be the same again.' The knife used by the gang to kill Sean McHugh . The court heard the attack was to avenge the stabbing of Dykstra two months earlier by the rival gang. Dykstra was already on bail for other offences when he committed the murder and three months earlier had received a conditional caution for threatening behaviour; Andrew Hewitt was subject to a sixth month referral order imposed in June 2013 for possession of a pocket knife and McGill had received two reprimands some years earlier for common assault and battery. O'Shaugnessy was on bail after being arrested 10 weeks earlier with cannabis worth £3,960 and £1,500 in cash. He also admitted possession with intent to supply. The defendant, who had an IQ in the bottom five per cent for his age group, told officers he began dealing drugs after being 'kicked off the dole'. McGill, who gave a knife to Dykstra before the attack, came from a 'good' family but had an IQ in the bottom four or five per cent for his age group with 'very limited intellectual functioning' the court heard and looked up to O'Shaugnessy. Dykstra had 'deep-seated' problems with ADHD and was used for fights by the gang because of his size though his mother, out of despair had 'pathetically begged' the authorities for help with him. Andrew Hewitt was assessed as having 'very low intelligence' comparable to a child aged seven, had a fascination for knives, did not attend his special school and led an 'aimless' life. Corey Hewitt was the only defendant never to have been in trouble before, though he had an 'extremely low' range of intellectual function and was easily led, the court heard. Since being in care he has been described as polite, likeable, well-behaved and an 'exemplary pupil.' The judge added: 'It speaks volumes, doesn't it, for a structured upbringing?'","Sean 'Shorty' McHugh was hacked to death in a Liverpool launderette .

"By . Ray Massey . Rolls-Royce is planning to break with more than a century of tradition by building a radical 4X4 off-roader. More than 100 years after the ultimate luxury British car firm was founded, bosses want the famous Spirit of Ecstasy that adorns bonnets to sit atop a 'Chelsea tractor'. Detailed design plans have been drawn up by executives, who accept the controversial idea will divide opinion. Proposal: Detailed design plans of the proposed 4x4 have been drawn up by Rolls Royce executives . In talks: Discussions between top bosses at Rolls-Royce and its German parent company BMW over the design have taken place . Details of discussions between top bosses at Rolls-Royce and its German parent company BMW over the design have been revealed in CAR magazine. It comes as Rolls-Royce, whose boutique factory is based in the Earl of March's estate in Goodwood, Sussex, prepares to launch a new two-door coupe called the Wraith at next month's Geneva Motor Show. It will go on sale in Autumn priced around £225,000. Rolls-Royce already builds four versions of its range-topping Phantom and two versions of its smaller 'baby' Ghost. But executives are planning a sports utility and two-seater sports cabriolet, with both at the planning stage. Porsche broke the 4X4 mould when it launched its Cayenne sports utility vehicle. And Bentley is currently giving a facelift to a prototype super-luxury Bentley off-roader which it plans to launch within 18 months. News of the radical Rolls-Royce 4X4 plans emerged in an interview with BMW board member and Rolls-Royce chairman Harald Krüger. Sleek: Executives are also planning a sports utility and two-seater sports cabriolet . Asked if Rolls-Royce would follow Bentley’s lead, he said: ‘We’re monitoring the competition’s activities, and we’re regularly debating whether to take action. This applies to all brand-relevant segments and technologies.’ Rolls-Royce said last night the idea of a 4X4 was 'speculation' but did not deny reports that detailed plans have been drawn up. CAR editor Phil McNamara said: ‘Rolls-Royce is thinking the unthinkable. Its advanced design team has sketched radical proposals for two prospective models: one is a Rolls-Royce crossover sports utility vehicle. The other is a two-seat roadster.’ He said: ‘The BMW and Rolls management are hotly debating the character of a Rolls sports utility vehicle, with two different proposals under review, called Coach and Pullman . Rolls Royce will launch a new two-door coupe called the Wraith at next month's Geneva Motor Show . A teaser shot of the eagerly-anticipated new model . ‘Coach, as the name implies, is solid and stately, square and slab-sided, substantial and supreme. ‘Pullman is influenced by legendary first-class trains like the Royal Scotsman or the Orient Express. Lower than Coach as well as longer and sportier, Pullman would feature an airy glass roof, a split rear lid made to measure for exclusive tailgate parties and an extended rear overhang.' Mr McNamara said: ’It could sell like crazy in the USA and China. It’s up to Krüger and the BMW board to decide the way forward. A progressive faction wants to give the market what it craves, we’re told.  The battle for Roll-Royce’s future has begun.' Rolls-Royce was founded after sales and marketing genius the Honorable Charles Stewart Rolls met legendary engineer Henry Royce at the Midland Hotel in Manchester on May 4 1904 with the aim of creating the world's finest motor car. German car giant BMW bought Rolls-Royce Motor Cars from Vickers PLC in 1998 following a bidding war with rivals Volkswagen, with the first BMW-produced Rolls-Royce Phantom launched in 2003.","Detailed design plans have been drawn up by executives for the vehicle .

Arsenal have snapped up highly-rated Barcelona youth product Georgios Spanoudakis, who previously rejected a number of offers to sign with Arsene Wenger's side. The 15-year-old central midfielder joined the Catalan club's La Masia academy from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2009, but will now join Arsenal's Under-18 set-up for the coming season.

The Germany youth international is in the mold of former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas with an eye for a killer pass and technical ability. Spanoudakis becomes the seventh signing of Arsenal's youth team following Kristopher Da Graca, Ben Sheaf, Elias Hatzitheodoridis, Hugo Keto, Jonatas Centeno and Savvas Mourgos to the Emirates. The Barca youngster's signature won't be the first that Wenger has grabbed over the years as the Frenchman has made a habbit of picking up some of the best Catalan talent. Most notably, of course, Wenger plucked Fabregas from the Barcelona B team at just 16 years of age back in 2003. Cesc Fabregas . The Spaniard made his debut for Arsenal in 2003 at 16-years-old and quickly became a fan favourite. Fabregas was soon made club captain and made 303 appearances for the north Londoners, scoring 57 goals before returning to Barcelona in 2011. Jon Toral .

After just 20 league appearances in two seasons, Merida joined Brazilian side Atletico Paranaense. Julio Pleguezuelo Selva . Pleguezuelo signed for Arsenal in the summer and his style has already been likened to that of Barca defender Carlos Puyol.

According to reports in the Spanish press, the king told aides he felt the time was right to pass the throne on while Prince Felipe was still a young man. ‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles,’ he reportedly told Rafael Spottorno, chief of the royal household. The private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering abdicating since his 75th birthday in January last year. Steady feet: Despite needing a stick to walk, the king appeared steady on his feet amid concerns in the Spanish press over his ailing health . ‘He saw, above all, that his son was in his prime and didn’t want to see him like Prince Charles who will be 66 years old in November,’ Mr Spottorno told Spanish daily newspaper El Mundo.

"By . Martin Robinson . Sent for trial: Army veteran David McIntyre, 43, will be extradited to the United States today to stand trial over an alleged £66,000 fraud . A British army veteran who served in Bosnia and Northern Ireland is being extradited to the United States today over an alleged £66,000 fraud. David McIntyre, 43, has said he is 'disgusted' with the Government as he travelled to London to be 'hauled in shackles' on board a plane to Washington this afternoon. He is due to arrive in North America tomorrow and will be held at the high-security Chesapeake Detention Facility in Virginia as the US authorities gather witnesses 'from all corners of the world' to testify against him, he said. 'I am disgusted and I am innocent. I feel let down by the country I love and have fought for,' he said today. The fraud case concerns a contract between Mr McIntyre's security firm Quantam Risk and the US Institute of Peace. It is alleged that McIntyre overcharged the institute by $100,000 (£66,000) when providing security for the group in Iraq during a break from army service. He faces eight counts of fraud and a possible 20-year jail term in an American prison. No court date has been set. Mr McIntyre, from Hyde, Tameside  is being extradited despite a long campaign and lawyers' pleas that he poses an 'enduring high risk of suicide' and suffers from severe post traumatic stress disorder . The soldier, who served in the Territorial Army before joining the Queen's Lancashire Regiment in 1996 said: 'I am going today. I have said goodbye to the kids this morning and I will be in processing by Friday. 'I am going to be held there until people are drawn from all corners of the world to testify against me. 'I wanted to get public support behind me, but this has not happened. 'I have lost my job and potentially I am going to lose my family home. I just cannot understand it. 'No one has bothered helping me, and that includes David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May. 'I just feel let down by the whole of my country.' Damning: Mr McIntyre says he served his country for decades only to be 'let down for the country I love and fought for' On duty: Mr McIntrye, pictured in Iraq, will be held in Virginia before a trial, but no date has been set yet . The nation's top judge however ruled last month that the Bosnia and Northern Ireland veteran would suffer 'no injustice' if extradited to stand trial. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, ruled that there was no 'real risk' that the father-of-two would suffer 'inhuman or degrading treatment' within the US penal system and his extradition would not violate his human rights. He is facing trial on fraud charges relating to alleged over-charging by his private security firm in Iraq in 2008 and 2009 - allegations which he vehemently denies. A campaign calling on the government to intervene and allow him to stand trial in Britain has attracted 2,000 signatures. Mr McIntyre left the Army in 2002 and set up security company Quantum Risk, which employed a team to provide security to Americans in Iraq. It is alleged he overcharged a US organisation by 100,000 US dollars  - £65,000.","David McIntyre, 43, is being 'hauled in shackles' to Washington today .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . There's a good chance that the only person more upset that the Denver Broncos lost this year's Super Bowl than quarterback Peyton Manning is the owner of a chain of furniture stores in Texas - Manning may have lost the game, but Jim 'Mattress Mack' McIngvale nearly lost his shirt. Thanks to a promotion McIngvale ran at his chain of Houston-based furniture stores, he's out $7 million after the Broncos were blown out by the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday night's Super Bowl. McIngvale's company, Gallery Furniture, is one of the largest chains of independent furniture stores in the U.S. And McIngvale is well-known around Houston for both his philanthropy and flamboyant promotions. Scroll down for video . 'Mattress Mack': Jim McIngvale is paying out $7 million in refunds to customers because the Seahawks won the Super Bowl . So, for Sunday's big game, McIngvale  promised customers who spent at least $6,000 in the past two weeks and . took delivery before Sunday's game that he'd refund their purchase cost . if Seattle won. Seattle didn't just win, the Seahawks embarrassed the Broncos in one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history. A man of his word, McIngvale says he plans to pay up. 'The accountant is pulling his hair out this morning, but the customers . are happy and that’s what’s most important,' McIngvale said to ABC News. McIngvale  said Monday that his accountant told him the latest promotion was a 'crazy idea' and now the accountant is 'pulling his hair out.' In the long run, though, the businessman thinks the promotion will pay off. '[The promotion] worked for making the customer say ""This guy does what he says he’s going to do,’” McIngvale said. Bad news: McIngvale says his accountant is 'pulling his hair out' but that he plans to honor the promotion . In all, he says, more than 1,000 customers will receive an average refund of about $7,000 from the promotion.  His insurance does not cover the losses. The past NFL season already has cost McIngvale more than half-a-million dollars following a similar promotion. After the AFC and NFC Championship games, Gallery Furniture paid a total of $685,000 to 100 customers who picked the Seahawks and the Broncos to make it to the Super Bowl. In a similar promotion, a car dealership in Missouri lost more than $300,000 in this year's Super Bowl. Promotions: McIngvale says the promotion was still a success because customers know that he is a man who honors his word . As part of a promotion, the Hutcheson Ford dealership in St. James, Missouri, . offered potential customers the deal of a lifetime in its 'Super Weekend . Sale': If a player returns an opening kickoff for a touchdown in the . first or second half of the Super Bowl, anyone who bought a vehicle . between January 29 and February 1 would receive a refund of the purchase . price of the vehicle. Unfortunately for the dealership, 12 . people bought vehicles between the 29th and the 1st - and Percy Harvin . returned the opening kickoff of the second half 87 yards for a . touchdown. 'We're like ""Oh, my gosh,"" there's this five percent chance of this . happening, and it just blew up in our faces,' Kathleen Frazier, . marketing manager for the dealership, told ABC17News. Philanthropist: McIngvale is well-known around Houston for his flamboyant promotions and his charity work . In all, the dealership ended up paying 12 customers more than $300,000 for purchases ranging from $10,000 to $50,000.

"By . Stephen Adams . Pensioners should be allowed to continue driving until they are 80 before having to renew their licences, according to a review by transport officials. They are urging ministers to relax the current mandatory renewal age of 70 to save money and make the Drivers and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) more efficient. But safety campaigners warn the move could cost lives and insisted regulations for older drivers should be strengthened, not relaxed. The DVLA is groaning under the weight of . renewal applications from pensioners who still want to drive in their . 70s, according to the review by the Department for Transport (DfT) said. It argues for the age limit to be raised ‘to reduce the burden of . regulation.’ Transport officials are urging ministers to relax the mandatory renewal age of 70 to make the DVLA more efficient. They suggest motorists should continue driving until they are 80 (library image) Currently drivers must send their licence to be renewed when they reach 70, declaring if they have any medical conditions which could affect their driving, and confirming they can still read a number plate  at 65ft. After 70, they must reapply every three years to keep driving. But with the population living longer while still being fit to drive, the DVLA is finding it hard to cope. Nearly 60 per cent of over 70s now drive – up 15 per cent from 1975. Over the past decade the number of drivers the DVLA medically assesses a year has jumped more than 50 per cent, from under 500,000 to 750,000. The agency now deals with 1.4 million items of ‘medical mail’ a year. Mary Reilly, a non-executive director of the DfT, who was asked by ministers to write the review – published last week – said that the DVLA, which costs £420million a year to run, must become ‘significantly more efficient, and provide better value for money’. She said raising the renewal age could relieve pressure on the DVLA ‘with little or no impact on road safety’. Ministers should ‘consider whether the existing requirement to renew a driving licence at age 70 is still appropriate’, she says. ‘A number of European countries renew driving licences at age 80 or have no limit at all. Early analysis of information held by DVLA suggests this could be introduced with little or no impact on road safety.’ But a report published last year by the RAC and Transport Research Laboratory found ten per cent of Britain’s four million drivers over 70 were not fit to be behind the wheel. Safety campaigners say the move could cost lives. Research by the RAC suggests 10 per cent of drivers over 70 are not fit to be behind the wheel . Safety organisations also warned last night the change could lead to more serious accidents on Britain’s roads.Kevin Clinton, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: ‘Changing the renewal age from 70 to 80 should only be done on the basis of evidence that this would not increase risk.’ A spokesman for road safety charity Brake said: ‘It is concerning the DfT is considering raising the age for licence renewal. The regulation that’s in place is there for a reason. At this age, conditions that can significantly impair your ability to drive safely become much more common, so it’s essential we have robust procedures to ensure older drivers are not inadvertently putting themselves and others in grave danger.’ She said Ministers should strengthen rules for older drivers, not weaken them. A DfT spokesman said: ‘The review of the DVLA has made several recommendations to improve the efficiency of the service. Any change to the current driving licence renewal age would require extensive consultation and no decisions have been made.’","Officials urging minsters to relax mandatory licence renewal age of 70 .

"By . Richard Spillett . The son of a Government minister has quit the Royal Marines after admitting assaulting two men in a row over racist slurs. Benjamin Grant is the son of Tory Sport and Tourism Minister Helen Grant MP, who described seeing him awarded his green beret three years ago as 'one of the proudest days of her life'. But the 22-year-old has quit the Armed Forces after a fight outside a nightclub for which he escaped immediate punishment following a judge's finding he was provoked. Scroll down for video . Former Royal Marine Benjamin Grant lashed out over alleged racial abuse outside a nightclub. A judge gave him a conditional discharge because of the 'very exceptional circumstances' of the case . Grant, who served in Afghanistan with the Marines, left the elite Corps after being involved in a fracas outside a night club in Barnstaple, North Devon in November last year. He was serving as a driver with the Commando Logistics Brigade at RMB Chivenor and had just returned from a four-week exercise on Salisbury Plain when he went out clubbing with friends. He was caught on CCTV punching a 20-year-old birthday party reveller in the face after accusing him of racially insulting him and pushing another man away as he tried to separate them. A jury at Exeter Crown Court cleared Grant and fellow marine James Stott of causing grievous bodily harm to bystander Ryan Behn, 19, who suffered a broken jaw in the melee. Grant, who gave his address as the £1.8 million family home in  Surrey, had previously admitted assault by battery on Jack Yarde, 20, and Curtis Wenham, 19. He was given a two-year conditional discharge by the judge today. Judge Phillip Wassall said: 'You are of good character until that evening. I am quite satisfied you only acted in that way because you were on the end of vile and objectionable racist taunts. Grant's mother is Helen Grant, the Tory Sport and Tourism Minister who is widely considered to be a rising star in David Cameron's cabinet . 'You should not have pushed Mr Wenham out of the way or struck Mr Yarde with a punch. It is very difficult for anyone who is not from a minority ethnic group to understand how hurtful it is to be called a P*** b****** or worse. 'Such are the extenuating features that I am making a conditional discharge in the light of very exceptional circumstances.' The judge made no order for compensation because Grant was 'subjected to such outrageous provocation'. Grant's mother, Helen, is one of David Cameron's A-listers who became Conservative MP for Maidstone and the Weald at the last election. She has served as a junior minister at the Ministry of Justice, where her responsibilities included women, equality, and victims' rights. The incident involving her son broke out on a pavement in Barnstaple, Devon when Grant got into an argument with Mr Yarde, who he said had repeatedly called him a 'P*** c***'. CCTV showed Mr Yarde  shout something as Mr Wenham stepped in to try to keep them apart and Grant then pushed him away before punching Mr Yarde in the face and grabbing Mr Behn in a headlock and dragging him to the ground. Grant was then chased by Mr Yarde and Mr Wenham. Mr Behn got up but was then felled by a blow from Mr Stott. Grant, of Tadworth, Surrey, and Stott, 30, of York, denied causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Behn and were found not guilty at Exeter Crown Court after a week-long trial. Defence barristers had argued it was impossible to say who had inflicted the broken jaw and that both were acting either in self defence or in defence of the other. The prosecution said the two men were acting together in a joint enterprise but the CCTV showed Stott was not even in the picture when Grant started the fight. Grant claimed he reacted to racist abuse from Mr Yarde. He said he had experienced racial 'banter' in the Marines, including being called 'Terry Taliban', but this abuse was different. He said: 'I don't take offence at racial banter but it is different if someone who you don't know says it in a nasty way. I am not going to take it. 'I took my coat off because I was going to confront him and ask him what his problem was and why he was saying this. If he had said sorry I would 100 per cent have walked away.' A jury at Exeter Crown Court cleared Grant of causing grievous bodily harm after a week long trial . He added: 'He used the same words again and his friend was keeping me back. He grabbed me and was telling me to eff odd. I pushed Mr Wenham away and punched Mr Yarde in the face. 'I got Mr Behn in a headlock and got him to the floor. I did not hit him. I grabbed him because I saw his hand come up in my peripheral vision. I had no quarrel with him or Mr Wenham.' Grant said he has left the Royal Marines since the incident and is now working as a civilian and has a girlfriend who is eight-months pregnant. Mr Yarde told the jury he could not remember making any racist comments. Stott, who is a special forces medic, said he had not been with Grant in the club but came out to see him being attacked and had rushed to his aid. He thought Mr Behn was about to corner Grant. He said he hit him to prevent him doing so.","Benjamin Grant, son of Tory Helen Grant MP, served in Afghanistan .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Only girls are allowed at a new workout class that promises fat-burning results in just half an hour. It's called Hiitgirl and is based on the principles of high intensity interval training. Women join exercise classes dependent on their fitness and follow a trainer telling them when to work hard and when to take short rests. The classes are all carried out barefoot and there's a giant timer on the wall to help people keep up with when to work intensely and when to relax. Scroll down for video . Keep up: For 30 minutes, counted down on big screens, women work out at high intensity with short rest periods . To keep things fun and interesting, the exercises in the class vary week to week but are all designed to raise the heart rate and tone the body. Sometimes body weight is used for resistance and on other occasions fitness 'toys' such as medicine balls, sandbags, skipping ropes and trampettes are used. Exercises such as burpees, press ups and sits ups are carried out as well as core stability moves like the plank. Each class lasts half an hour but because it involves high intensity exercise, participants boost their metabolism so they keep on burning fat for hours afterwards. Heavy lifting: Fitness props like bags are used for weight resistance . While the exercises themselves may not be anything new, Hiitgirl believe their female-only format and variety of different moves in each 30 minute session make them different. The classes were developed by fitness experts Susan and Stuart Dyson who wanted to find a way to help busy women fit exercise into their lives. They also wanted to attract those who are intimidated by the macho vibe at some mixed gyms and wanted to work out in a more female-friendly space. Susan said: 'Hiitgirl started with a simple question, ""how can busy women spend as little time as possible working out and still get amazing results?"" 'After speaking with lots of women it became clear that they simply didn't have the time or interest for endless cardio and expensive personal training. The majority wanted short and effective female-friendly workouts with inspiring trainers.' Writer and actress Arabella Weir admits she is a Hiitgirl convert since she first tried the class last month and has been going to three classes a week. No need for trainers: All the classes are carried out barefoot . She told MailOnline: 'I have been a member at a gym before and tried all sorts of different workouts but I needed something that was time efficient and easy to fit into my routine. 'Hiitgirl is all beautifully contained - it allows me to pop in and out in half an hour and I know I'm getting an intensive workout. It doesn't feel like a gym or a fitness studio, it's a lovely environment. 'I don't feel the sort of dread that I did with other . workouts. Knowing that you have to endure a long session with heavy . weights or a long run is often off-putting but with this, you know that . you only have to get through half an hour and that you'll likely be . doing something different to last time. It is exactly what I and many other women need - we're done and dusted in 30 minutes.' Arabella said it's one of the toughest workouts she has ever done but she's already noticing the results. She said: 'I noticed changes in my body shape after just a few weeks. My stomach is flatter and my clothes are looser. People are telling me that I'm looking slimmer in my jeans which - let's be honest - is what we all want to hear. Convert: Arabella Weir, left, with Hiitgirl founder Susan Dyson . 'I'm definitely fitter. The exercise that has always crippled me is press ups and now I can do them. The plank was the other exercise I could never master but again, I can manage the full 30 seconds.' The 55-year-old doesn't weigh herself so she doesn't know how many pounds she has shifted thanks to the workout. She said she prefers to focus on getting fitter and toning up than obsessing over the scales. She explained: 'Any woman past the age of 19 has to think of things in terms of fitness and shape, not weight. I don't weigh myself so I couldn't say if I've lost any weight but it's not about that. I know my shape is changing and I'm getting fitter.' Hiitgirl classes are held at three locations in Harrogate and at selected Sweaty Betty stores around the country. For those in London, they opened the first Hiitgirl Studio in Crouch End last month. For more information, visit hiitgirl.com . Women are taking inspiration from super-fit Olympians such as Jessica Ennis and are hitting the gym in pursuit of washboard abs, a new survey has revealed. Men, meanwhile, are looking towards the rugby fraternity and want powerful pecs similar to those displayed by Channing Tatum in 2012 film Mad Mike. But while stomachs and chests get plenty of attention, the backside, or glutes, is neglected with just three per cent of men and two per cent of women saying they do exercises designed to target them. Now a spokesman for Simply Gym, has warned that neglecting the buttocks could lead to a less than shapely physique. He said: 'The glutes often get ignored during workouts. If lunges, hip extensions and squats don’t appeal to you, classes such as Legs, Bums and Tums are a great way to target problem areas. 'Some women don’t like the idea of training with weights because they’re worried it will give them bulging muscles, but resistance training is not only great for toning up but will also boost your fat burning efforts,' he added.","Hiitgirl studios and classes are men free zones .

"By . Richard Spillett . Mark Slater has been convicted of murder after driving his lorry over the head of a grandfather following a road-rage row in February . A lorry driver was today jailed for life for murdering a grandfather-of-four by deliberately driving his 17-ton lorry over him following a petty row. Mark Slater drove the lorry over the head of Trevor Allen, 56, after Mr Allen stood in front of the vehicle when the pair clashed on the A57 near Warrington in February. The 46-year-old was convicted of murder after a jury at Chester Crown Court was shown 'dash-cam' footage of a road-rage attack carried out just months earlier by Slater, who the court heard was a 'coward' but became a 'big man' and a 'bully' behind the wheel of his truck. Sentencing Slater to minimum 15 years today, Judge Mr Justice Robert Jay said: 'You drove forward knowing full-well he was still out of the vehicle. 'As you were driving forward he waved his arms in front of him or upwards for you to stop but you did not or even after it occurred, driving forward some distance. 'You said if he was in front of you, you would have seen him. Well he was and you did see him. 'Although the intention was formed suddenly, the fact remains you were behind the wheel of a 17-ton vehicle which was familiar to you. Once the red mist descended all reason and restraint was lost.' The sentencing came after damning evidence showed the lorry driver from Oldham laughing and jumping up and down as he punched and kicked the car of another motorist in a previous incident. Two months after that, Slater and Mr Allen became involved in a row while both driving along the A57 on the outskirts of Warrington, Cheshire around 8am on February 15 this year. Both drivers had come to a halt on the single carriageway road with Mr Allen getting out of his van and standing in front of the lorry with his arms outstretched. It would have been 'obvious' to Slater that Mr Allen, a 'well-nourished' man of 16 stones and wearing a high-viz jacket, was in front of him, the court heard. Forensic examination showed the victim was dragged underneath the vehicle with his head in the area of the front driver’s-side wheel. A roadside witness shouted at Slater: 'You’ve f****** killed him!' After running over his victim, Slater stopped a short distance up the road and spoke to Simon Feltham, who stopped his own car to dial 999. Slater claimed Mr Allen had been 'throwing things' at his lorry and it 'all started down at the lights,' the court heard. Trevor Allen's family believe he may have been killed by Slater after trying to stop the truck driver from talking on his mobile phone while driving along the A57 near Warrington, Cheshire . Slater said they were involved in an 'over-taking session' and claimed Mr Allen had thrown coins at the window of his cab. The court heard that as Mr Allen lay dead in the road, Slater calmly told a 999 operator : ""Hiya love - there's a man seriously injured'. The taco-graph tracking the lorry’s movements before the fatal incident showed Slater pulling emergency brakes and 'flooring' the vehicle to its maximum 54mph - exceeding the road’s 40mph limit. After Mr Allen’s death, his family said: 'Trevor was an amazing, caring dad, granddad, brother, uncle, son and friend to many. 'His smile and charm made the room light up when he walked in. Loved by all who knew him, he is irreplaceable and will be very sadly missed.' The jury heard of two earlier road rage incidents, one caught on camera, involving other motorists and the defendant, before Mr Allen was killed. One motorist described Slater as like a 'raging bull' threatening, 'I will f****** kill you!' after an incident on the M62 in January last year, while another, Jordan Ogden, 24, who recorded the incident on his 'dash cam' described the defendant as 'animal like' and a 'predator'. Footage from a dashboard camera showed 'animal' Slater kicking a car in a previous incident of road rage . Mr Ogden told the jury an 'angry' Slater, 'looked like he wanted me dead', during the incident on December 17 last year in Oldham. The footage showed Slater getting out of his lorry cab on two occasions, running at the Corsa and kicking and punching the vehicle while trying to get the driver’s door open. Mr Ogden told the jury: 'I don’t know how someone can react so violently to a situation. It would be like an animal hunt. It looked like he wanted me and he wanted me dead.' After viewing the footage, Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, put it to Slater in the witness box: 'I’m suggesting what we saw there is you losing it with another road user, you have lost your temper and you have got a very short temper, a short fuse? 'And like the coward that you are, a big man behind the wheel and you become a bully in that lorry and that’s precisely what you were doing on that morning on the A57?' Slater tried to claim he hadn't seen Mr Allen in the road but the jury convicted him of murder . The defendant responded: 'No.' Slater told the jury while he accepted he drove over Mr Allen and caused his death, he said he simply did not see the victim standing in front of his vehicle. But he was convicted by the jury following three and a half hour deliberations at the end of a week long trial. Slater made no reaction when he was found guilty. He was remanded into custody and now faces an automatic life sentence. Many members of Mr Allen's large family burst into tears in the public gallery as the guilty verdict was delivered. Widower Mr Allen, a father-of-three and grandfather of four was himself one of 13 children originally from the Middleton area of Manchester. Outside court his eldest sister Muriel Farrell, 62, from Middleton said of her brother’s killer: 'I hope he rots in hell, I really do. We were all praying today for that murder verdict. 'It has been horrendous listening to it in court. It’s been terrible for the family, a lot can’t come to court because of it all. 'He was a lovely dad, a lovely brother, never caused any trouble, never been in trouble. He was actually a truck driver himself and he taught people himself how to drive HGVs.' Mrs Farrell said her family believed her brother may have spotted Slater using his phone while driving shortly before the incident, which the defendant admitted. Mr Allen’s family believe that, as a lorry driving instructor, he may have indicated to Slater to get off the phone - sparking the fatal confrontation. In a statement, released after the verdict, Mr Allen’s daughter, Sarah Allen said: 'After a very distressing and emotional trial, justice has finally been done for my dad. 'I am very pleased that such a dangerous man has been convicted and is no longer a danger to other people. 'I wouldn’t wish this to happen to another family because it’s destroyed ours more than anyone could ever imagine.'","Mark Skater ran over grandfather-of-four Trevor Allen in February this year .

"By . Charlotte Griffiths . A poster advertising a satirical play about the Monarchy and, showing Prince Charles gagged, has been censored by London Underground because it fears it could cause offence. The advert for the critically acclaimed production of King Charles III features a punk-style portrait of the Prince with his mouth covered by white duct tape. But despite the fact that the poster has been displayed across London since the play opened nearly three weeks ago, a nervous Transport for London has decided to pixelate Charles’s face. Posters advertising the play King Charles III at The Almeida Theatre Islington were pixelated by TfL over concerns the punk-style image may cause offence . The original image used for the poster. TfL blamed the company that deals with adverts on the Tube last night for the pixelled image . Last night there appeared to be confusion over exactly why the poster had been censored. TfL laid the blame on the company that deals with adverts on the Tube, saying the ban was made amid fears that the image might cause offence, but it could not say who it was afraid of offending. A TfL spokesman said: ‘We work with a company called Exterion Media, which handles our adverts on the Tube network and offers advice. ‘They may say this or that could cause offence. Exterion may have said the poster doesn’t fit with part of their policy. 'The decision was made without reference . to us and does look to have been a little over-enthusiastic. We will . speak to them about it.’ A Clarence House aide said no attempt had been made to contact Charles, pictured during a visit to south west London last month, about his image being used . Tom Moloney, of the NB Studio which designed the poster, said the news had come as a shock. He added: ‘We weren’t aware until we sent the artwork. We sent it off  and it was sent back. All we know is we had to change it in line with their feedback. It was to do with TfL’s rules and regulations about what you are allowed to put up on their sites.’ The Almeida Theatre, in Islington, North London, where the sold-out play  by Mike Bartlett opened  on April 3, still displays a  large uncensored version of  the poster. A theatre spokesman said: ‘I believe the artwork designers had to pixelate Charles’s face in order for TfL to let us put the posters up.’ Last night, a Clarence House aide said that no attempt had been made to contact Charles about his image being used, nor had the Prince instructed anyone to censor the advert. The play takes place after the Queen’s death and focuses on the Prince of Wales as he is about to ascend to the throne after ‘a lifetime of waiting’. Meanwhile, Prince Charles could be crowned as King of an independent Scotland under radical plans backed by SNP leader Alex Salmond. A separate ceremony would effectively mean Scotland becoming a kingdom in its own right.

His manager Paul Vaughan said he had spoken to the star in hospital, who sounded ‘very tired’. Mr Vaughan said he believed the episode was an asthma attack. ‘I’ve been his manager for 30 years, and I know that if he goes down like a ton of bricks it’s usually asthma,’ he added.

Tarrant had been in Burma filming a new Channel 5 travel series. Mr Vaughan said: ‘I’m surmising, but I think his asthma attack might have been triggered by a night-time stopover in Bangkok, which has very poor air quality.’ A London Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed that one of its crews had taken a man from Heathrow to hospital ‘as a priority’.","TV presenter requested an ambulance upon arrival at Heathrow .

"By . Stephen Adams . Hospital bosses had to declare an ‘internal emergency’ and turn away ambulances from a packed A&E unit – weeks after they closed a nearby emergency department. Doctors at Barnet Hospital in North London had to shut their doors to ambulance patients on January 31 this year – only to do the same thing again just two days later. According to a leaked letter, ‘capacity issues’ in the hospital’s A&E forced ambulances to be sent elsewhere. Struggle: Doctors at Barnet Hospital were forced to declare an 'internal emergency' shutting their doors to ambulances after being swamped by patients . The two incidents follow the controversial closure last December of Chase Farm Hospital’s A&E six miles away, which has heaped pressure on nearby hospitals. Last night, a spokesman for Barnet And Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust denied the diversions were caused by the A&E downgrade, adding: ‘The Trust experienced high numbers of attendances and ambulance arrivals to A&E on 31 January. ‘As a consequence of this, and in line with NHS England policy, Barnet Hospital declared an internal emergency and... non-urgent ambulances were diverted.’ She added that diverts, as they are known, were not unusual and that there were 19 in total across England that weekend. But angry campaigners claim the A&E closure is ‘putting lives at risk’, while local MP Nick de Bois said that hospital managers had serious questions to answer. Dozens of A&Es across the country are under threat, as the Government and some doctors argue that the NHS cannot afford to have an emergency unit in every hospital. Critics have warned of the knock-on effects of the closures, which can force seriously ill patients to travel further to receive treatment – and then face more delays once they get there. Downgrade: Chase Farm Hospital's A&E was controversially closed. It is six miles from Barnet Hospital, heaping pressure on the North London trust's emergency department . Paramedics say the Chase Farm closure has led to a dramatic increase in ‘stacking’ at North London hospitals, where ambulances have to queue to drop off patients. ‘I have always said the downgrade was . the wrong decision, because the demands of the local population would . lead to problems at other A&Es. Official NHS statistics bear this out, showing the number of ambulances waiting for more than 30 minutes outside one hospital has risen seven-fold. Last week, NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson said that ‘centralised, large units... work best’ and warned that the NHS could not afford to keep smaller departments open. But Kate Wilkinson, of the Save Chase Farm campaign group, said: ‘This has become a very dangerous situation where there are not sufficient front-line services to deal with demand. It’s putting lives at risk. There needs to be some serious and honest discussions with the decision makers, who need to admit there is a lack of services.’ Last month, this newspaper revealed how two-year old Hashir Naveed died  after his desperate mother took him to Chase Farm at 3am – only to discover that its A&E department had recently been closed down. Two weeks later managers declared an ‘internal major incident due to capacity issues in Emergency’ at Barnet Hospital with ‘ambulances queuing’, according to a letter to GPs. East of England Ambulance Service was asked ‘to ensure that alternative hospitals are utilised’ and GPs were told not to send in patients ‘where possible’. Stacking: The closure of Chase Farm's A&E has also heaped pressure on North Middlesex University Hospital, where 34 extra ambulances have flocked to the trust every day since the closure . The crisis in Barnet’s A&E on January 31 was triggered by there being ‘no beds available’ for admitted patients to move into, wrote Jacqui Bunce, associate director of East and North Hertfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group. Two days later a similar thing happened and ambulances had to be sent elsewhere. Last winter, when Chase Farm A&E was still open, ambulances never had to be diverted from either hospital. NHS statistics also show that since Chase Farm A&E closed on December 9, ambulances have had to wait outside Barnet Hospital for more than 30 minutes on 236 occasions. Over the same two-month period  last winter, that happened only 167 times – and then the figures related to ambulances outside both hospitals, not just Barnet. However, the increase in stacking outside North Middlesex Hospital has been far more startling. Since Chase Farm A&E closed, ambulances have had to wait over 30 minutes on 941 separate occasions – or 14 times a day. During the same two-month period last winter, this only happened 132 times – or twice a day. Dangerous situation: Nick de Bois, Tory MP for Enfield North, said: 'Before Chase Farm A&E closed we were repeatedly told that capacity at Barnet would not be an issue. These early indications suggest that clearly they cannot. I have always said the downgrade was the wrong decision' North Middlesex board minutes show concern over the issue with the hospital receiving 34 extra ambulances a day since the closure, ‘compared to an expectation of 29’. This has led to ‘some clustering of ambulances which has caused some pressures on the flow of patients in to and through hospital’, wrote director Martin Armstrong. Ambulance crews are meant to hand over patients within 15 minutes of arriving but performance on this is ‘significantly below target’. A North Middlesex spokesman said that, as a result of the changes that included the Chase Farm downgrade, it was expected the hospital would see an extra 26,000 patients a year. Nick de Bois, Tory MP for Enfield North, said: ‘Before Chase Farm A&E closed we were repeatedly told that capacity at Barnet would not be an issue and they would be able to cope. These early indications suggest that clearly they cannot. ‘I have always said the downgrade was the wrong decision, because the demands of the local population would lead to problems at other A&Es. ‘When you have got ambulances stacking up outside the doors of North Mid to that extent, it does beg the question: Why are we downgrading other emergency departments?’ Two-thirds of the public oppose plans for a new NHS database that will see details from confidential medical records being sold to companies, a poll has found. Within weeks, GPs will be forced to hand over medical records, including sensitive information such as mental health diagnoses, to build the database. Last month it emerged that four in ten doctors intended to opt their own records out of the care.data project. Now an online poll of 1,161 adults  by YouGov has found widespread opposition among the public. When asked if they would ‘support or oppose’ proposals to allow firms  to access the database in exchange  for a fee, 65 per cent said they  were against the idea. Retired GP Dr Ron Singe said: ‘The Government needs to explain who is going to get access to this data, for what purpose and for how much.’ Martin Caldwell, of pressure group SumOfUs.org, which commissioned the poll, said: ‘The consequences for ordinary people could be huge. ‘It’s not hard to imagine the value  of this information to the likes  of insurance companies, banks  or marketing firms.’","Chase Farm Hospital's A&E closed in December .

"By . Stephen Adams . and Sanchez Manning . Closed: Hashir's mother, Maryam, took her two-year-old son to Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield, North London, which lost its A&E unit last month . A two-year-old boy has died after his desperate family rushed him to hospital – only to discover that its A&E department had recently been closed down. The mother of Muhammad Hashir Naveed frantically tried to raise the alarm after she arrived at Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield, North London, at 3am last Wednesday and found the doors locked. After banging on the doors and then finding an emergency phone outside the unit, she managed to contact a nurse, who rang for an ambulance and immediately tried to resuscitate the boy. But after being ferried five miles to the North Middlesex Hospital at Edmonton – the nearest Casualty department – Hashir, as he was known, was pronounced dead. Friends said the half-hour delay caused by first going to Chase Farm may have cost the boy his life. The tragedy also highlights concerns about the dangers of closing A&E units and replacing them with so-called Urgent Care Centres. Despite paramedics and doctors working to resuscitate the boy for 45 minutes, Hashir was pronounced dead at 4am. Last night a family friend said he thought Hashir might have survived if the A&E department at Chase Farm had still been open. A full investigation has now been launched into the death by the NHS trust that runs Chase Farm, which lost its A&E last month. Nick de Bois, Conservative MP for Enfield North, said the closure had left a ‘confusing mish-mash’ of emergency services at the site. Calling on Ministers to review dozens of planned closures across the country urgently, he said downgrades resulted in people being forced to make complicated decisions about where to go, in the most ‘distressing’ of circumstances. Hashir’s mother, Maryam, 27, decided to take him to hospital after he woke up in the night, listless and running a high temperature. His father Muhammad was working so the boy’s uncle drove them. Friend Waleed Mirza said: ‘He thought it was better to drive themselves to Chase Farm rather than calling an ambulance. So they drove to the hospital but when they got there A&E was closed.’ The 24-hour department shut on December 9 and was replaced with a doctor-run Urgent Care Centre, which is open from 9am to 9pm. It . is not staffed or equipped to deal with patients in life-threatening . situations. At night, emergency cover is provided by an on-site GP. Patients can use an emergency phone which is situated at the entrance door. When Hashir’s mother found the phone, it was answered by a senior nurse. She came down to help, rang for an ambulance at 3.12am, and started resuscitation. The ambulance arrived at 3.20am and it got to the North Middlesex at 3.37am. Hashir was pronounced dead at 4am. Mr Mirza said: ‘If doctors had been . able to treat him at Chase Farm it might have made all the difference.’ But he said Hashir’s parents, who were too distraught to speak last . night, accepted what had happened was God’s will. Mr Mirza described Hashir as a ‘very lively boy’ with no known medical history. Mr de Bois, who campaigned against the Chase Farm A&E closure for years, said: ‘My deepest sympathies go to the parents and family for the tragic and shocking loss of their son. ‘They went to Chase Farm in good faith under the most distressing circumstances, thinking that this was the right place to go in the middle of the night.’ He continued: ‘It is not fair to expect people to distinguish between urgent care and life- threatening conditions when they are at their most vulnerable, but that’s what they are expected to do now that A&Es are being downgraded across the country to Urgent Care Centres. ‘With Chase Farm’s UCC only open 12 hours a days but with the promise of 24-hour doctor cover, it is not surprising that what is available can appear to be a confusing mish-mash of emergency services.’ Frantic: The family banged on the doors until a nurse emerged and called an ambulance to transport them . He also called on Ministers to review all A&E closure plans across the country. Those behind the closure said the A&E had to shut because it could not be properly staffed around the clock, which was dangerous. But campaigners said the decision – which they believed was to save the NHS money – would put people’s lives at risk. In Opposition, David Cameron vowed to save Chase Farm from an ‘unjustified’ top-down reorganisation, and promised a ‘bare-knuckle fight’ over the closure of local  hospital services. In October 2007 he and fellow Tory Andrew Lansley even joined campaigners outside the hospital in a protest. But in September 2011 Mr Lansley, as Health Secretary, approved the A&E closure. A spokesman for Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘We would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the family on the loss of their son. ‘The new Urgent Care Centre at Chase Farm Hospital is open from 9am to 9pm seven days a week. There is an emergency phone at the entrance for patients who arrive outside these hours. 'The trust can confirm that an ambulance was called immediately by trust staff. The child was attended to onsite where resuscitation was initiated. ‘The child was placed in the care of the London Ambulance Service who continued to resuscitate him during the transfer to North Middlesex University Hospital.’ A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘Extensive efforts were made by staff to resuscitate the boy and he was taken as a priority to North Middlesex Hospital.’","Mother of Muhammad Hashir Maveed rushed to Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield, North London, when he woke at 3am with high temperature .

"By . Stephen Adams . Controversy: Épochas claims its new 'body sculpting' cream burns fat while its users sleep . It sounds too good to be true – a skin cream that helps you to slim while you sleep. But that is the claim made by the creators of Épochas, a new ‘body sculpting’ cream said to help burn fat from specific areas – including the waist, inner thighs and chin. However, scientists have dismissed the product as a con, accusing its manufacturers of ‘preying  on vulnerable people’. Despite their concerns, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says it has no power to investigate the claims unless it receives a complaint about the product. A 75ml pot of cream and a 50ml tube . of serum are being sold together on the Epochas website at the ‘launch . promotion price’ of £74.95. Customers are advised to apply the cream in the morning and the serum at night to ‘lose inches’. According . to the Epochas website, they provide a ‘gentle non-surgical method to . assist the removal of accumulated fat molecule deposits in specific . regions of the body’. The publicity for the products states: ‘In our UK trials, 24 women lost 41 inches in just ten days.’ Formulated by make-up artist Frank Roman and his doctor son Carlos, the cream and serum are made in a small Sussex factory. The ingredients of the cream include elastin, green tea and the chilli extract capsaicin. Mr Roman said: ‘I have been working in cosmetics for 50 years, and I’ve heard so many claims you take them with a pinch of salt. So when we tested this and found it worked well, it was a shock. ‘We’ve found that with this cream and serum, you can lose inches in your sleep.’ Susan Gedge, 57, agreed to test the product despite her biochemist daughter Louisa telling her it was unlikely to have an effect. Mrs Gedge, from Guestling in East Sussex, said she dropped from size 16 to 14 in ten days. She said: ‘Before, I had a roll of fat hanging over my waist. That’s gone. I was amazed.’ Epochas said the results of the 24-person trial were mirrored in a second trial, run by a GP in Hastings. Dr Craig Namvar said he decided to test the product after it helped him lose two inches from his 35in waist. He pitted the firm’s products against Johnson’s, which make  no ‘body sculpting’ claims. The  volunteers were not told which they were receiving. Dr Namvar said: ‘Every woman in the Epochas group lost centimetres from their waists.’ Those using Johnson’s either stayed the same or expanded a little in girth, he added. Scientists have dismissed the product as a con, accusing its manufacturers of 'preying  on vulnerable people' Dr Namvar insists he has no financial involvement with Épochas. However, the firm’s chief executive Stephen Finch admitted neither  trial was independently checked. He said the products were licensed as cosmetics, which was ‘not so rigorous’ compared with obtaining a licence as a medicinal product.Épochas’s claims have been criticised by the British Dietetic Association, which gives science-based dietary advice. Lead dietician Sioned Quirke said: ‘They should be reported to the ASA. They are preying on vulnerable people. Not even changing your diet can help you lose fat in a certain area. It comes off from everywhere.’ She said the trials were so small as to be statistically meaningless, and that no cream in history had been proven to help shift fat. An ASA spokesman said firms have to prove claims – but only if a complaint is made to the regulator. The UK Advertising Codes state firms ‘must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective’. In 2012, the ASA ordered cosmetics firm Rodial to stop advertising an ‘anti-cellulite gel’ using the term ‘body sculpture’, because the name ‘implied the product would have an impact on a user’s body shape’. Adam Lee Potter, pictured with wife Deborah, claims he lost an inch off his waist after three days . Effortlessly lose your beer gut? In days? Lead me to it! The last time my figure came under public scrutiny – a feature on chest waxing in 1993 – the photographer told me: ‘I thought you’d be fatter.’ Sadly, 20 years on, it was the other way round. But I was horrified – when the tape measure round my waist hit 37in. People have clearly been lying to me (and not just Gap). Now, I am as sceptical as the next middle-aged man when it comes to weight-loss gimmicks. If you want to shave inches off your waist, the real answer is simple – do more, eat less. I am, if nothing else, the son of a doctor. But we’re all suckers for the easy fix, especially pre-Christmas. Aggressively rubbing a cream into your belly is clearly preferable to sit-ups and a daily lettuce enema. I have to be honest: I don’t believe in this cobblers. So, it pains me to say that – after three days – I have lost an inch off my waist. Mostly, I believe it’s the shock caused by being measured. But, with these results, why not give it a go?","Creators of Epochas claim it sheds weight on waist, inner thighs and chin .

"By . Stephen Adams . Denial: Sir Burce Keogh insists a two-tier A&E system does not mean a cut in services . The disturbing truth of what really happens when ‘super A&Es’ are  created is today exposed by The Mail on Sunday. Our research has found that: . The country’s top doctor has said costly staff and equipment should be concentrated in 40 to 70 Major Emergency Centres. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, Medical Director of the NHS, said last week it was ‘complete nonsense’ that downgrading smaller A&Es would be the price to pay for turning bigger ones into super-centres. And he argued sending the  most seriously ill directly to super A&Es, bypassing local units, would save lives. But The Mail on Sunday – which has vigorously highlighted the danger to patients of A&E ‘rationalisation’ – has found that recent moves to centralise A&Es have led to local cuts. The remaining emergency hospitals have frequently been overwhelmed with sick patients. Across England there are 197 A&E departments. Sir Bruce insists his plan will not mean cuts. He claims evidence shows rationalising the number that deal with serious heart attacks, strokes and life-threatening injuries will lead to ‘vastly increased survival’ for patients. Sir Bruce said last week: ‘This has been described on the one hand as a two-tier system or on the other as a downgrading of a lot of A&Es. This is complete nonsense.’ But in the North-East, centralising A&E services at North Tees Hospital in Stockton triggered the eventual loss of all emergency facilities in Hartlepool, bar the town’s out-of-hours GP service and a nurse-led minor injuries unit. What’s more, when health bosses closed . Hartlepool’s A&E in 2011, they stated the local hospital would . retain its Emergency Assessment Unit. A reassuring leaflet said the EAU . had: ‘A highly skilled team of doctors, nurses and other health . professionals who are specially trained to deal with patients with . serious medical problems.’ The EAU was particularly important to the town’s 15,000 pensioners – whose numbers will swell by 50 per cent by 2030. But last month, after a three-month ‘consultation’, it was closed and relocated to North Tees  Hospital – a total of 13 miles away. Hartlepool also lost 120 emergency beds to North Tees. Local councillor Keith Fisher said: ‘I did warn that the hospital would lose more of its services if the A&E closed. Some people didn’t believe me. The hospital board made promises and then broke them.’ He claimed: ‘If you dig down, what you find with “centralisation” is a cheaper service, not a better one.’ At least the area kept its emergency beds. When managers closed the Emergency Medical Centre at Wycombe Hospital, in Buckinghamshire in October 2012, they jettisoned 73 of its 153 medical beds. The centre – which had essentially been an A&E which did not take trauma patients – was downgraded to Urgent Care Centre because it did not have enough consultants. A&E services were centralised at Aylesbury’s Stoke Mandeville Hospital. But Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust decided not to move the beds to Stoke Mandeville as it could ‘cope’ with the existing 132. It meant that across the two sites, one in four emergency beds was lost. Managers argued: ‘We expect the number of beds [at Stoke Mandeville] to remain unchanged, as we will continue to reduce the hospital length of stay with greater use of our recently developed community services. This will allow us to cope with the increased number of admissions within the existing number of beds.’ But The Mail on Sunday has been contacted by many patients who have spent hours in Stoke Mandeville A&E as there were no beds free. Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, which, like Stoke Mandeville, is 14 miles from Wycombe, has also been hit by the fallout. From Wycombe the route to Stoke Mandeville is along a winding A-road, while most of the way to Wexham Park is on the M40. Yet NHS planners thought Wexham Park would get only 2,500 of Wycombe’s emergency patients a year, while Stoke Mandeville would get 13,500. Nine months before the Wycombe . closure, Wexham chief executive Philippa Slinger wrote that the change . might have ‘an impact’ on her hospital although she said this would . ‘likely be towards the end of the year’. Nonetheless, . £2.5 million was put aside to upgrade Wexham Park’s A&E. But by . March 2013 only £150,000 of that money had been spent by deeply indebted . Heatherwood and Wexham Park NHS Foundation Trust, board papers show. The . consequences have been borne by patients and overstretched staff. Like . all A&Es, Wexham Park is meant to treat 95 per cent of patients in . four hours – but in the year after Wycombe closed, it only reached that . benchmark for three weeks out of 52. In January, executives were forced to admit they had an ‘acute shortage of escalation capacity’ – the whole hospital was too full. They drew up a ‘Remedial Action Plan’ for the A&E and built two quick-fix ‘modular wards’ containing 28 beds. A&E overcrowding continued and in mid-April almost three in 10 patients were having to wait four hours or more. Heatherwood and Wexham Park Trust failed to respond when asked to comment. A spokesman for Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said that the number of medical beds at Wycombe was cut by 73, but that 20 additional beds were eventually put in at Stoke Mandeville. She said £5 million had been invested in Stoke Mandeville’s A&E. A spokesman for North Tees & Hartlepool NHS Trust said in 2011 the plan had been to keep the EAU at Hartlepool until a new hospital was built at Wynyard in 2014. However, she said the EAU had to be removed sooner because the Wynard project had been delayed and rising clinical standards forced centralisation sooner. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Our recommendations do not suggest the downgrading of A&E departments. Any suggestion that this is the case is to completely misunderstand what we have said.’ Seven A&E units across England have been closed – or ‘downgraded’ – since 2007. And right now, another 15 face downgrading or losing key facilities. But senior NHS figures believe as many as 60 could go. NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh claims downgrading smaller units is not part of his super A&E plan. But as we reveal today, recent evidence shows boosting one hospital’s A&E tends to go hand-in-hand with cutting facilities at another. In addition, decisions about how to reorganise A&E services will be largely down to local NHS organisations. NHS England will only oversee ‘the big picture’. Our analysis shows eight of the current 15 facing closure or losing facilities are in London – about a third of all A&Es inside the M25. Last week, Dr Mark Spencer, medical director for service design and quality for NHS England in London, said he thought that scale of change was needed nationwide. He said his guess was that ‘there will be a 20 or 30 per cent reduction’ in A&Es taking blue-light ambulances across the country. If that happened, up to 60 of England’s 197 A&Es will be affected. However, Sir Bruce has made clear that what works in cities will not necessarily work in rural areas.","Research by Mail on Sunday revealed how one town was slowly stripped of all emergency facilities as part of a 'super A&E' plan .

"By . Mark Nichol . and Nic North . and Stephen Adams . Police are investigating whether three super-fit soldiers who collapsed and died on an SAS endurance march earlier this year had consumed a potentially fatal cocktail of performance-enhancing drugs. Corporal James Dunsby, 31, Trooper Edward Maher, 31 and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, died in July after a 20-mile march in extremely hot conditions in the Brecon Beacons, South Wales. Last night, Kelvin Roberts, 53, the father of L/Cpl Roberts, confirmed that police believe doping could have played a part in the deaths. Exhaustion: Corporal James Dunsby, a member of the Army Reserves suffered multiple organ failure during the test . Dyfed Powys police have questioned recruits from the soldiers’ Army Reserve regiments on their use of substances such as ephedrine, a restricted substance with similar effects to the Class B drug amphetamine, as well as body-building supplements and energy drinks. Further tests have been ordered after post-mortem examinations failed to find a cause of death. Asked if his family had been told L/Cpl Roberts might have used stimulants before the march, Mr Roberts said: ‘Yes, we are aware of something like that but I don’t want to say any more at the moment.’ The potential doping link to the deaths of the SAS recruits comes one month after the Army’s biggest-ever performance-enhancing drugs scandal. As The Mail on Sunday revealed, 17 members of the 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, were caught using ephedrine. They have been kicked out of the Army. Soldiers interviewed by police have suggested that doping was taking place inside the SAS. They have also described how a ‘muscle culture’ inside the regiment might have influenced how soldiers prepared for ‘Selection’ – a series of gruelling marches. A source said: ‘The police are asking what they took before the march and what the guys who lost their lives might have taken. On the course everyone was looking for a competitive advantage. ‘There was some honesty in the wake of what happened because some good blokes died. There were also some deep discussions at the funerals which resulted in information being passed to the police. Loss: Trooper Edward Maher was declared dead in the evening and, right, his colleague Lance Corporal Craig Roberts who died on the side of the mountain . ‘Whatever supplement you take there’s a danger. On a hot day in the hills a soldier will be in a lot of trouble. After taking supplements he’ll perspire faster, drink his water ration sooner, and once this runs out he’ll be in big trouble.’ Cpl Dunsby, Tpr Maher and L/Cpl Roberts, who had all served in Afghanistan or Iraq, were hoping to get into the reservist regiment 21 SAS. They set off at 6am on July 13 towards Pen y Fan – the highest point in southern Britain. In the afternoon, as temperatures rose to more than 30C (86F), the soldiers ran out of water. L/Cpl Roberts was declared dead on the mountain while  Tpr Maher was declared dead that evening. Cpl Dunsby suffered multiple organ failure and died in hospital a fortnight later. Their deaths constituted the biggest loss of life in the history of SAS Selection. Three other soldiers received treatment at the scene for heatstroke. Last night, sports and exercise medicine consultant Dr Richard Weiler said: ‘Ephedrine is a stimulant. Its danger level depends on the dosage but it is not great to take in combination with the other factors on that day. ‘A very high caffeine intake would have left the men dehydrated and agitated.’ Defence sources named two high-caffeine products popular among soldiers – Smart Burner and Ripped Freak – which are available in specialist sports shops. The Powys coroner’s office, the police and the MoD declined to comment.","Corporal James Dunsby, 31, Trooper Edward Maher, 31 and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, died in July after a 20-mile march .

"By . Stephen Adams . Plastic surgeons have developed a stem cell treatment to overcome the one remaining giveaway of a woman’s true age – her crinkly hands. It will solve the problem of ‘Madge mitts’ – named after the singer Madonna who has otherwise held back time but whose veiny hands betray her true 55 years. While diet, exercise and face lifts mean many women look much younger than their age, hands are still a sure giveaway. Madonna has otherwise held back time but her veiny hands betray her true 55 years . The new treatment breaks down fat taken from the patient’s body to produce a solution of stem cells. The liquid is then injected just below the surface of the skin and these stem cells transform into skin cells over weeks and months, thickening and smoothing the skin. Doctors behind the treatment, which is referred to as nanofat grafting, are also using it to reduce dark circles under the eyes, caused by thinning skin, and to rejuvenate the neck and breast area. Dr Alexis Verpaele and colleagues at the Coupure Centre in Ghent, Belgium, have carried out nanofat injections on 100 patients, of which about ten were into patients’ hands. Dr Verpaele said: ‘Injecting nanofat improves the skin’s quality. It makes it smoother and corrects imperfections to reverse the crepey and wrinkly texture that affects women from their late 40s and 50s.’ Skin naturally thins with age, he said, making muscle, bone and veins more visible. The skin itself also becomes more textured as it loses elasticity. Hands exhibit these signs very clearly because they have little fat to begin with. While diet and exercise mean many women look much younger than their age, hands are still a sure giveaway . He added: ‘Hands have been a little bit overlooked for a long time by plastic surgeons. We are finding there is huge demand for this.’ Dr Verpaele’s hand treatments, which cost between £1,300 and £1,700, include nanofat as well as injections of slightly larger ‘micro fat’, to plump up lost fat volume, and lasering to get rid of small dark liver spots. These ‘micro fat’ injections, of fat harvested from the patient’s thighs, buttocks or stomach with very fine needles, have already been used in plastic surgery for some time. The former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, Fazel Fatah, has said there is no evidence that Dr Verpaele’s stem cell method is superior to existing  fat-injection treatments. But leading American surgeon Dr James Stuzin said results suggested nanofat could be ‘truly regenerative’.","Plastic surgeons develop stem cell treatment to overcome crinkly hands .

"By . Stephen Adams . Breakthrough: Scientists have found that taking multivitamins may dramatically boost older women's chances of beating breast cancer (stock image) Scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer – which kills 1,000 British women every month. Research has found multivitamins may dramatically boost older women’s chances of beating the disease. Taking the pills daily cut death rates by 30 per cent among post-menopausal breast cancer sufferers. Professor Sylvia Wassertheil-Smoller, who led the study, said the findings were ‘surprising’ because multivitamins had never been found to reduce the odds of developing breast cancer in the first place. About 48,000 women develop the disease each year in the UK. She said: ‘We don’t know how these multivitamins and minerals might work, but they could contribute to women’s overall health, which may help them better withstand the assault that cancer represents.’ One theory is that vitamins help at  a cellular level by stopping a process called oxidation, which is linked to cancer development. Prof Wassertheil-Smoller, from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, and her colleagues made their conclusions after looking at survival rates in almost 8,000 women aged 50 to 79 who had been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Participants were followed for an average of seven years after being diagnosed. Just over a third took combined multivitamin and mineral supplements while the remainder did not. Those who took the daily pills were found to be 30 per cent less likely to have died of the disease within the study period than those who did not take them. However, specialists are likely to take some convincing that multivitamins have such a powerful anti-cancer effect because so many other studies have been inconclusive. They also point out that women  who take multivitamins are more likely to live healthy lives than  those who do not. On average they  are thinner, take more exercise and smoke less. Study: Scientists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, looked at survival rates in almost 8,000 women aged 50 to 79 who had been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer (stock image) But Prof Wassertheil-Smoller, who has spent decades examining health issues affecting older women, said the results of the study held true even adjusting for these differences. She stressed that multivitamins appear to have no beneficial effect  on survival among younger breast cancer patients. Eluned Hughes, Head of Public Health at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘Although these results are promising, much more research is vital in order for us to truly understand whether multivitamins are beneficial in the fight against breast cancer and ultimately stop women dying from the disease. ‘We advise women receiving treatment for breast cancer to speak to their oncologist about taking any supplements as some can interfere with treatments.’","Research found multivitamins may boost older women’s chances of beating the disease - developed by 48,000 in the UK every year .

"By . Stephen Adams . More A&E departments will have to close for safety reasons as they are weeded out under a tough new hospital inspection regime, the new boss of the health watchdog has admitted. Some hospitals ‘will find it difficult’ to prove their A&Es are up to scratch as they come under renewed scrutiny by inspectors from the Care Quality Commission, the regulator’s chairman David Prior warned. His comments in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday raise the possibility of more fights over closures in the next two years, which could be increasingly difficult for the Government in the run-up to the General Election. Under threat: More A&E departments could have to close for safety reasons under a tough new inspection regime (file picture) Since 2007, eight A&Es across England and Wales have closed and a further 18 are threatened. Many face closure on the premise that centralising services will save lives, but Mr Prior said the public had yet to be convinced. Between now and Christmas the CQC will be going into 18 hospital trusts, which together run 24  A&Es, to undertake thorough inspections. Six of those trusts, which run ten A&Es, have been identified as being at high risk of providing sub-standard care. The CQC wants to have inspected all of England’s 161 major hospital trusts by 2015. Mr Prior thought the CQC’s  beefed-up inspection regime, which includes doctors and nurses from elsewhere and patients going into hospitals, would find that some emergency departments were unsafe. Labour last night said the Government was presiding over an ‘unprecedented summer crisis’ in A&E after new figures showed a sharp increase in waiting times. The number of hospital trusts missing the target of seeing  95 per cent of patients within four hours shot up from 38 to 57 – a rise of 50 per cent over last summer. It means that 40 per cent of England’s biggest A&E departments are now missing the target. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘Patients are given dates for their long-awaited operations, only to be put back on the waiting list as hospitals grapple with the A&E crisis. ‘David Cameron is presiding over the first summer A&E crisis in living memory.’ ‘This may drive further reconfiguration, driven by patient safety, not driven by financial considerations,’ he said. Some hospitals simply did not have enough senior doctors to provide safe A&E care. ‘If you take A&E, the availability of consultant doctors 24/7 – or for at least 16 hours a day – is really important,’ he added. ‘Now it’s bloody hard for a small hospital to provide that kind of cover, because it’s so expensive. I think the reality is that some smaller A&Es will find it difficult.’ He went on: ‘If we are going to get reconfigurations in the NHS, I think it’s much more acceptable if it’s driven by patient safety and quality, than by financial reasons.’ Among the six ‘high-risk’ trusts to be inspected soon is the Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Trust in Essex. It runs A&Es at Queen’s Hospital in Romford and King George Hospital in Goodmayes, the latter due to close in 2015. Local councillor Andy Walker, of the Save King George Hospital campaign, said: ‘There is truth in the argument that centralising specialist services for conditions like strokes and heart trauma save lives. 'But there are loads of clinicians  who say that for other conditions, particularly among the elderly, speed is vital. These people will need a consultant as soon as possible. I believe there’s still a need for district general hospitals.’ Soon to be inspected: The A&E at Queens Hospital, Romford, is run by the 'high-risk' Barking, havering and Redbridge NHS Trust . Risk of 'financial failure': One of the other 'high-risk' trusts is the London NHS Trust which runs the A&E at Whipps Cross Hospital, pictured . Another of the six ‘high-risk’ trusts is Barts and the London NHS Trust – England’s biggest – which runs three A&Es in East London including one at Whipps Cross Hospital. Barts is losing £2 million a week and is at risk of ‘financial failure’, chief executive Peter Morris said recently. Rumours are circulating among staff that Whipps Cross’s A&E could be axed too, but this has been denied by the trust. On Thursday, Ministers announced that struggling A&Es would get an extra £500 million over two years to help ease some of the pressure, although critics have dismissed the cash injection as a ‘sticking-plaster’ solution.","David Prior CQC chairman says some hospitals will struggle to prove they are up to scratch .

"By . Stephen Adams . and Sanchez Manning . A hospital chief executive has been paid almost half a million pounds in compensation after he fainted in his office and claimed he could no longer work because of stress. Roger Tarver, 68, was awarded a £370,000 lump sum – plus £24,000 a year for life – after claiming the stress of the job left him psychologically scarred and damaged his heart. His payout from an official NHS compensation scheme for work-related injuries dwarfs that given to many soldiers who have sustained horrendous battlefield wounds fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Compensation: Government figures show that the Department of Health in England is currently paying out £47million a year under the NHS Injury Benefits Scheme, to 8,000 former employees who were injured before 1997 . The case illustrates just how generously NHS employees are treated after claiming they cannot work, compared to servicemen who receive a medical discharge. Taxpayers are shelling out £77 million a year on work-related compensation for doctors, nurses, hospital managers and other NHS staff in England, The Mail on Sunday has found. By comparison the Ministry of Defence's spend on injured servicemen, through the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, is just £44million a year. Campaigners last night said the figures, and Mr Tarver's case in particular, showed how soldiers' lives were regarded as 'cheap'. Mr Tarver, former chief executive of City Hospital in Birmingham, is being paid under the NHS Injury Benefits Scheme. Described as 'the best-kept secret in the NHS' by health unions, it gives payments of up to 85 per cent of a claimant's final salary every year for life, if their ability to work has been impaired. Mr Tarver was medically retired in 1996, aged 51, months after collapsing in his office. He was taken to the cardiac unit with a racing pulse and later diagnosed with acute stress and heart problems. He retired on his NHS pension but in 2009 won a claim under the injury benefits scheme, for £370,550 to be paid retrospectively, plus £24,000 a year for life. By comparison, Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson was initially offered just £152,000 plus a £19,000-a-year pension after he lost both legs in an Afghanistan landmine explosion in 2006. His mother Diane Dernie, who fought a successful campaign to more than triple his payout, last night criticised the disparity between the sums given to NHS staff and servicemen. She said: 'The figures are pretty indicative of the way that soldiers' lives are held to be cheap.' Mr Tarver yesterday defended his payout, but agreed many would think it unfair compared to those awarded to many soldiers. Speaking from his detached home in Dorridge, West Midlands, he said: 'I don't think my payment was generous – I worked bloody hard for the NHS for 30-odd years. 'The job was impossible. It was daft. I had to make decisions that resulted in patients dying, like who can have the intensive care bed. 'I was in a position of having to act as God. Would you want that?' Asked if his payout was unfair compared to those paid to many soldiers, he said: 'I agree – but I don't negotiate the conditions of service.' Government figures show that the Department of Health in England is currently paying out £47 million a year under the NHS Injury Benefits Scheme, to 8,000 former employees who were injured before 1997. That puts the annual average award at £5,875 – more than twice the average annual payment under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme of £2,750, once lump sums are factored in. But the true annual cost of the NHS scheme to the taxpayers is likely to be a quarter higher, at almost £59 million, because when post-1997 claims are included the number of cases still being paid increases by 25 per cent to 10,129. Further costs: Every year about 1,800 former health workers receive £18million in one-off compensation payments outside the government's existing scheme, raising the total annual payout to £77million . In addition, every year about 1,800 former health workers receive another £18 million in one-off compensation payments outside the scheme. That puts the total annual compensation figure for NHS staff in England alone at £77 million. The NHS Injury Benefits Scheme was replaced in April with a far less generous version called the NHS Injury Allowance Scheme. The main difference is that payments are limited to a year's salary per incident. But because the original scheme pays out for life, huge sums will continue to be paid for years to come. Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth said Parliament needed to examine whether the military covenant – the agreement under which the state pledges to look after its servicemen – was being upheld 'not just in spirit but in action'. He added: 'The Government wants to make sure we give priority to our servicemen, particularly to those who are injured and put their lives on the line. 'With the best will in the world, that's not what NHS people do.' A Department of Health spokesman said the injury benefits scheme had been scrapped because it was 'archaic and expensive'. An MoD spokesman said: 'We are committed to making sure that those injured as a result of their service get all the financial and welfare support they need.'","Roger Tarver was awarded a £370,000 lump sum - plus £24,000 a year for life .

"By . Martyn Halle . Detectives have also begun a separate inquiry into the death of Lillian Williams . Police have launched an investigation into allegations of neglect at a hospital in South Wales and arrested three nurses over falsification of patient records. The three nurses, a man and a woman in their 40s and a 29-year-old woman have been suspended and are on police bail. Detectives have also begun a separate inquiry into the death of Lillian Williams, an 82-year-old amputee. Her family claim she was neglected on several occasions when she was admitted four times at two hospitals before she died in November 2012. On . one occasion they called the police to say Ms Williams was being . 'killed' by Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and that other . patients were at risk. Her son Gareth Williams, 54, a retired teacher from Porthcawl, Glamorgan, said: 'We stayed with her round the clock because of previous neglect. But she was still neglected. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.' Miss Williams, who raised five children on her own, was admitted to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend three times where she stayed on two different wards and Port Talbot Hospital once between August 2010 and November 2012. Her family say her dentures were 'welded' to the roof of her mouth because they were not removed at night which caused her to develop mouth ulcers. Staff have also been accused of not taking off her artificial leg to prevent sores. It is also alleged that she was deprived of fluid for days and became seriously dehydrated. Allegations: Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where Lillian Williams was admitted . On one occasion she was put on nil by mouth in error and because it was the weekend no doctor could be found to change the instructions. After more than a month in hospital in 2012 she got very weak and doctors told the family she had pneumonia and that they were going to withdraw support, all food, drink and drugs. They say her death was painful and agonising. The family queried the pneumonia diagnosis by a consultant. And they say two junior doctors told them they doubted the diagnosis. The pensioner died in November 2012 four days after having medical support withdrawn.A post mortem revealed her death was not due to pneumonia. It was put down to a heart attack, probably caused by withdrawal of anti-blood clot medication. Miss Williams was also admitted to Port Talbot Hospital (pictured) once as well as Princess of Wales Hospital . Following an inspection in 2012 of the Princess of Wales Hospital as well as other allegations, the NHS is reviewing the care of patients at the Bro Morgannwg Health Board in South Wales. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action Against Medical Accidents, said: 'We have heard from a number of people with serious concerns about the care at the hospital and the way that complaints have been handled. 'And we are concerned that the review which has been ordered is inadequate and will not get to the root causes of the problem.' A spokesman for the trust said: 'We would like to again offer sincere condolences to the family of Mrs Williams and apologise for poor care we have identified that Mrs Willims recieved from ABMU Health Board. 'We are currently unable to comment of specific aspects of this case due to ongoing police investigations. 'We apologise sincerley to patients and families who we have let down at the Princess of Wales Hospital.' Last week a separate investigation was launched into the Princess of Wales Hospital after the death of another patient who died after being kept in an ambulance for four hours outside the A&E department .","A man and a woman in their 40s and a 29-year-old woman have been suspended and are on police bail .

"By . Stephen Adams . Health bosses spent thousands  of pounds sending a helicopter and four ambulances to a car crash 70 yards from a hospital – because its A&E ward had been closed leaving the injured having to be ferried miles to other units. They spent £2,500 despatching the Chilterns Air Ambulance to the accident near Wycombe Hospital in Buckinghamshire, which lost its emergency department a year ago. Two rapid-response vehicles and two ambulances were also sent to the crash, in an operation that cost up to £3,500. They were scrambled after a driver in his 80s had a suspected heart attack at the wheel of his Renault Clio and lost control of the car. It ploughed into a pedestrian, causing him serious leg injuries, then careered into two empty parked cars. The Clio driver was also hurt. Wycombe Hospital staff rushed out to help, but as the complex now only has a minor injuries unit which is not equipped to deal with badly injured patients, they were unable to take them in. The town lost its emergency department last October as part of changes to centralise A&E services across the area. The nearest emergency departments are now 13 miles away, at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, and 15 miles away at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury. In May, The Mail on Sunday, which has been spearheading a campaign to save the country’s threatened A&Es, revealed how the Wycombe closure had led to serious knock-on effects at these two hospitals. Aftermath: Police cordon off the scene after the crash close to Wycombe Hospital in Buckinghamshire . NHS documents showed 16,000 extra emergency patients would be pushed there every year. Managers claimed the two A&Es had been bolstered to cope with the extra strain. But studies showed the closure led to soaring numbers of patients waiting more than four hours in the two A&Es last winter. At Wexham Park, which is in neighbouring Berkshire, 20 per cent of patients ended up waiting more than four hours in the winter – three times higher than the national average. Hundreds of scheduled operations were also cancelled due to an increase in emergency admissions. Our report on Wycombe led to questions about the closure being raised in Parliament by Lord Campbell-Savours, a Labour peer. He asked what assessment the Government had made of the impact of the closure and was told by the Health Minister Earl Howe that there was ‘no Government policy about the closure of A&E departments’. Loss: The A&E unit at the Buckinghamshire hospital closed down a year ago . The crash happened just before 1pm on Tuesday. The first paramedic, who arrived five minutes after the 999 call, ordered the air ambulance thinking an airlift might be urgently needed. In the end the two elderly victims were sent by road ambulance. The injured pedestrian, who is in his 70s, went to Stoke Mandeville. Last night, a spokesman said he  was in a stable condition. The car driver went to Wexham Park where he was checked over and discharged the same day. Alison Crook, 42, from Bourne End in Buckinghamshire, who uses Wycombe Hospital, said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous that they had to send an air ambulance to Wycombe because it lost its A&E. 'If they had kept it, they would have saved all that money.’ She went on: ‘The ambulances now seem to operate as a taxi service between the hospitals.’ Paul Harper, 77, who witnessed the aftermath of the crash, said the organisation by the emergency services ‘was brilliant’. Campaign: One of our reports highlighting the affect of closures . But he added: ‘The fact they had to send these ambulances to take them to different hospitals – that’s a different matter.’ Mr Harper, a retired businessman who is being treated at Wycombe hospital and was trying to get in for a blood test at the time, feared the closure of the emergency department would put him at risk in the future. He said: ‘The real crisis for me is if I have to be whisked away in an ambulance, all the way to Aylesbury, which is a ridiculous journey.’ Ironically, the cost of the helicopter mission will not be picked up by the NHS, but by the charity which supports it. The EC135 Eurocopter operates out of RAF Benson in Oxfordshire and costs Thames Valley and Chilterns Air Ambulance £1.5  million a year to run. The aircraft covers Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire so is affectionately known as the ‘BOB’ service. A spokesman said: ‘We rely entirely on charitable donations from the public and receive  no central government or National Lottery funding.’ Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Wycombe Hospital and Stoke Mandeville, claimed the emergency department had been closed to create a better ‘hub and spoke model’ in the region. A Trust spokesman said: ‘In Buckinghamshire, Stoke Mandeville  Hospital has been designated as a trauma unit, with the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford designated as the region’s major trauma centre. Wycombe Hospital has a minor injuries and illness unit. ‘The creation of this hub and spoke model is due to national clinical evidence showing that this improves patient safety and outcomes.’","Wycombe Hospital in Buckinghamshire lost its A&E a year ago .

"By . Martyn Halle . What an organ-isation: A British family has set a record for kidney transplants . A family with 11 members who have each received a donor kidney has set a UK transplant record. All of them suffer a genetic condition called Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD). Briggetta Greenaway, 55, who joined her brother, two uncles, three aunts and four cousins in the transplant club, said: ‘We are  a unique family.’ Her uncle Bill Smith was the first family member to receive a transplant in 1963 in one of the UK’s first kidney transplants. He died four months later of organ rejection, but four of his siblings had successful transplants between 1986 and 1998. The disease is now into the third generation of the family, with  five of Briggetta’s nephews  likely to need a transplant in the near future. Briggetta, a care worker from Chesterfield, who received her transplant in 1999, said: ‘We have all said thank you for this gift of life by keeping ourselves fit and healthy.’ She has traced the disease back to her grandfather Will Smith, who died aged 50. All of his eight children had PKD. Briggetta’s brother Barry Greenaway, a road transport manager from Redhill in Surrey, said: ‘It’s amazing that so many  of us have had transplants, and almost all of them have gone well. ‘Without my transplant, I wouldn’t be working in the demanding job I now have. Getting a new kidney and coming off dialysis transformed my life.’ PKD is believed to affect about 60,000 people in the UK. Sufferers have a 50 per cent chance of passing on the defective gene to their children, and around half will need a transplant. The family’s story is testimony to how many lives have been saved by NHS transplant surgery. ‘Having half a dozen family members with a transplant  would be something, but 11 is staggering,’ said a spokesman for UK Transplant. Symptoms of PKD include high blood pressure, faulty heart valves, problems urinating and enlarged kidneys. Over time, cysts cause kidney failure. it's all in the family: The Greenaway-Smith family suffer from a genetic condition called Polycystic Kidney Disease (stock image)","Eleven members of a UK family suffer from Polycystic Kidney Disease .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Police enjoyed free tickets for eight years to watch a top Premier League side at the centre of an anti-corruption inquiry. Dozens of officers and staff took advantage of six Arsenal season tickets provided by the wealthy North London club. The deal will deepen concerns about the cosy relationship between it and the Metropolitan Police. Earlier this month the Daily Mail revealed star player Mesut Ozil faces questions over how three Scotland Yard detectives ended up in his private box at a match. The freebie: Detective Sergeant Simon Jones (left) and Mesut Ozil (second left) in the player’s box at the Emirates with a youth, an unidentified fan and Detective Constable Helen Nicolson (far right), who was not involved in the investigation . Just 24 hours earlier some of them were tasked with speaking to him after his car collided with a photographer outside his home. Senior politicians tasked with overseeing the Met said the season ticket deal raises worrying questions about the impartiality of police. Baroness Jenny Jones said: ‘Accepting hospitality like this gives the impression that not everyone is equal before the law and that favours can be bought.’ The ticket deal began in 2005 when Arsenal agreed to hand over six season tickets every year to police in the London borough of Islington. The sought-after seats were handed out on a ‘match-by-match’ basis to officers and staff as a reward for good work, the Met said. It is not known how much the tickets were worth, but the cheapest Arsenal season ticket for the 2014/15 season is £985 and the most expensive almost £2,000. Helen Nicolson was photographed grinning as she shook hands with Ozil . Probe: Football superstar Ozil on the night of the incident. Freelance photographer Lee Essex dialled 999 claiming Ozil had driven his Porsche into him, knocking his arm with a wing mirror . But the hospitality, worth tens of thousands of pounds, was abruptly stopped when a new area chief took charge last year. The season ticket deal was revealed as questions over the conduct of Arsenal and World Cup final star Ozil remain unanswered. The German faces being quizzed on his return to London over the presence of three detectives in his private box at a match in February. Just 24 hours earlier a police inquiry was launched when a photographer claimed he was assaulted by the star after being hit by his car. Mesut Ozil (centre) scores for Arsenal in the Premier League against Newcastle United last season . Two of the detectives at the match are believed to have been asked to assist that investigation which was dropped within weeks. Bureaucrats in a traffic office wrote to the photographer to tell him the inquiry was over and blamed the lack of ‘independent evidence’. All three detectives, who were initially suspended from frontline duties, face being questioned under caution later this month for potential misconduct. Colleagues insist the trio are guilty of nothing more than ‘stupidity’ but chiefs are concerned their actions may have brought the force into disrepute. The tickets were not the only gestures of goodwill from Arsenal to the police force. It donated a £640 camera to its football liaison team and gave police use of two vehicles, a Citroen Dispatch van and a Saab car. The force also paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the cost of policing matches at its Emirates ground. Caroline Pidgeon, a London Lib Dem politician, said: ‘Before accepting any hospitality every police officer should ask fundamental questions as to whether acceptance is good for policing and how it would be perceived by the public. ‘It seems staggering that for so long a number of police officers in Islington completely failed to ask such basic questions and ignored the Met’s own gifts and hospitality rules.’ The misconduct probe is a potential embarrassment for Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, a Sheffield Wednesday fan who regularly plays competitive 5-a-side. Earlier this month he led a conference at the Emirates Stadium for some of the force’s most senior officers. Up to 800 chief inspectors and superintendents attended an event at the Arsenal ground aimed at improving the working culture of the force. A Met spokesman said: ‘Between 2005 and early 2013, Arsenal FC donated approximately six season tickets per year to Islington Borough. ‘These tickets were used on a match by match basis to recognise good work and community spirited work undertaken by police officers and staff and members of the public. ‘The allocation of the tickets was recorded on the borough and there was senior officer oversight. ‘In February 2013 the arrangement was reviewed by the new borough commander and stopped.’ An Arsenal spokesman said: ‘We have always worked closely with the Metropolitan Police who are hugely important to our activities and the safe running of our matches. 'The tickets were provided for the force to use at their discretion under the oversight of a senior officer.’","Dozens of officers and staff took advantage of six Arsenal season tickets .

"By . Martyn Halle . It is no coincidence that advances in keyhole surgery ten years ago led to a steady rise in the number of people deciding to donate a kidney. The operation, which can be performed via an incision so tiny that it can be hidden in the belly button, was carried out 1,068 times in 2012 - almost three times the number a decade ago. Yet one of Britain's leading transplant surgeons now argues that a back-to-basics approach to open surgery - using fingers as well as surgical instruments - offers the best outcome for donors and transplant recipients. The  technique, known as finger-assisted nephrectomy, has been pioneered by Professor Nadey Hakim . The technique, known as finger-assisted . nephrectomy, has been pioneered by Professor Nadey Hakim. It reduces the . operating time from between two and three hours to just 45 minutes, and . according to new research, the donor is at lower risk of complications. The reduction in operating time also means the kidney is fresher for . transplant and there is less chance of the organ being damaged during . retrieval. Prof Hakim's unit at Imperial College Healthcare Trust in London is the only one of 30 UK transplant centres to use this method. A handful of European surgeons are also adopting his approach. Twenty years ago, all kidneys were removed using a large incision up to 8in long. Then, following the introduction of keyhole surgery, up to five smaller incisions were required, each measuring about 3in. During finger-assisted nephrectomy, a 1½in incision is made below the ribcage for removal of the kidney. The surgeon then uses his fingers to manoeuvre the kidney into a position where it can be removed, using instruments to separate it from the connective tissue that holds it in place. Once this is done, the organ is lifted out with  the fingers. 'With keyhole surgery, you are making . four or five holes for the instruments plus a 3in incision to remove the . organ,' explains Prof Hakim. 'Complications include accidental injury . to the bowel or a blood vessel which can damage the kidney itself. Getting the organ out of the patient itself takes longer once you have . separated the kidney. And the longer the kidney remains disconnected . without cooling, the greater chance of delayed function.' Finger-assisted nephrectomy means that the organ is 'on ice' a matter of minutes after it is separated from its blood supply. 'Patients are absolutely delighted because we leave them with such a tiny incision' Prof . Hakim adds: 'Keyhole surgery is a fine technology, but it is not . without risk and there are still merits in old-fashioned open surgery. 'Obviously both are an advance on the very large incision - as big as 8in - that we used to use in the pioneering days of kidney transplantation where everything inside was laid out for the surgeon to see. 'We have had only very minor complications with this approach and the patients are absolutely delighted because we leave them with such a tiny incision and very speedy recovery once they have left hospital. And making it safer and more comfortable for the donors will hopefully get more people to step forward. 'With nearly 6,000 patients on the kidney waiting list, anything that may increase the number of donors is to be welcomed.' Historian David McDowall, 68, decided to donate one of his kidneys to a stranger last year. The father-of-two from South London was delighted with his small scar and the fact that he was able to resume normal activities within a month of the procedure. Dr . Bessam Farjo, hair transplant surgeon and medical director of the . Institute of Trichologists, says: . 'While the root of a hair is alive and . can produce brand new hair, the end of the hair - made of the protein . keratin - isn't alive and can't repair itself. When damaged, the fibre . of a single hair can split into two or more and wither away. This occurs . due to chemical treatments, heat or chlorine, vigorous brushing, or . just wear and tear. Cutting your hair every six to eight weeks is the . only solution to preventing this.' Mr McDowall, who had his surgery last autumn, says: 'I decided to donate after surgeons at another hospital saved the life of one of my grandchildren - I wanted to give something that might help save another life. No one in my family needed a transplant, so I decided to donate to a stranger. My recovery was very fast. Six weeks later, it was if I hadn't had surgery at all.' Nicos Kessaris, a transplant surgeon at Guy and St Thomas' Hospital in London, says Prof Hakim's technique is widely admired. 'There's no doubt that he is a highly skilled surgeon and there is no reason why this technique couldn't be used at other centres,' he adds. 'My view is that both techniques - keyhole and finger-assisted nephrectomy - are safe. I use a variation called hand-assisted nephrectomy where the incision is about 3in and you put your whole hand in to remove the kidney. 'But the vast majority of retrievals are made by keyhole surgery. I think that being able to give the patient a choice is a good idea.' Mary Hart is a US television personality with great hair.

"By . Stephen Adams . Worried that Mum’s forgotten to take her medication today? Well, soon there will be no need to be – because scientists have invented a pill that sends a text to say it has  been swallowed. Doctors believe the novel device could prolong countless lives and save the NHS millions by cutting the amount  of medicines that go to waste. Each of the ‘texting pills’ contains a tiny metal sensor, the size of a grain of sand, that emits a signal when it gets wet in the stomach. It then passes harmlessly through the body. The pill’s signal is picked up by a patch on the arm, which transmits the message by wireless Bluetooth technology to the person’s mobile. The phone then texts the patient’s contacts – such as a loved-one and their doctor or nurse – telling them it has been taken. Lloydspharmacy and Oxford University have been involved in UK pilots of the technology, called Helius, which is being developed by US firm Proteus Digital Health. Professor Lionel Tarassenko, from the university’s Institute of Biomedical Engineering, said: ‘Elderly people sometimes have to take six, seven, or eight pills a day. ‘But if someone doesn’t take their pills that can be a very, very serious thing. If you have an elderly parent who is not taking their pills, you might want to know.’ He is hoping to start a UK trial next year using the texting pills with heart failure patients. So far he has been limited to testing the patch itself, which can track and relay other information about the patient such as their pulse, activity levels and sleeping patterns. Doctors believe the novel device could prolong countless lives and save the NHS millions by cutting the amount  of medicines that go to waste . Lloydspharmacy has completed a UK pilot with patients who have high blood pressure. They often need to take several medicines a day. The test-run – like others in the US – has involved patients taking an extra ‘dummy pill’, containing just the sensor, in addition to their medication. But Proteus soon hopes to embed their tiny sensors in pills containing active drugs. CEO Andrew Thomson said: ‘When you swallow one of our digital drugs it will say, “Hello I’m here, I’m Novartis, I’m Diovan, 1.2mg, I’m from plant number 76, I’m batch number 12 and I’m pill number two.” ’ He claimed the invention could save the NHS ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’. A university study found we spend £300 million a year on medicines that end up being thrown away. Part of the wastage is due to people not taking medication, called ‘non-compliance’. The texting pills could combat a number of serious ailments, from mental health problems to tuberculosis, added Prof Tarassenko. He said: ‘TB patients have to take a six-month course of pills. Part of the problem is that after three or four months the patients feel so much better they stop taking them. But they are not cured by then and it’s very important that they keep taking the medication.’ Privacy campaigners do have concerns about the security of sensitive health data generated by the sensor pills . Privacy campaigners do have concerns about the security of sensitive health data generated by the sensor pills. But the academic said: ‘Personally, I believe it’s utterly ludicrous to think that way. ‘I ask them if they do internet banking and of course 99 per cent say yes. And anything to do with healthcare data has at least the same level of security as internet banking does.’ A Lloydspharmacy spokesman said its pilot had generated ‘very positive feedback’ from patients, their families and health professionals. It wants to get NHS doctors to recommend the technology to appropriate patients. She said: ‘Proteus Digital Health and Lloydspharmacy believe that a doctor-oriented approach opens opportunities to collaborate with the NHS and make the service more accessible and therefore allow more people to benefit from the technology. ‘ .

Motion sensors, blood-pressure monitors and even machines that screen for diseases like diabetes from the comfort of your living room are already part of thousands of British homes. Two years ago David Cameron publicly backed tele-health: remote monitoring that allows vital checks by these gadgets. Everything is sent to a call centre which can tell if a prescription needs tweaking, or if a family member or the doctor needs to be called. It sounds like sci-fi, but early trial results have been promising, showing a drop in emergency admissions. Everything is sent to a call centre which can tell if a prescription needs tweaking, or if a family member or the doctor needs to be called . There are more than 15 million Britons who have a chronic condition that requires self-management. It’s early days for the Helius, but ingestible microchip tablets that tell the doctor they’ve been taken may prove valuable. Coming up with a drug for an illness is just part of the battle. One of the biggest difficulties is actually getting patients to take them. Figures show up to half of patients don’t. The beauty of this technology is that we would be perfectly clear what dose and regime our patients were using. This could be especially effective in elderly patients with mental health problems. But the new technology is far from perfect. At the moment the microchip is contained within an extra dummy pill. If it’s hard enough to get Mum to take five pills, is adding another really making life simpler? And what if she gets confused and takes the dummy, and not the real pill? I’m all for scientific advance, but it mustn’t overshadow often cheaper basics. Perhaps there are simpler ways to help patients, such as a humble dosette box and an alarm clock. As exciting as it is, I envisage a long wait before this technology is part of my daily routine in clinic.","Scientists invented a pill that sends a text to say it has been swallowed .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Concern: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has warned that the criminal justice system is not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration . More than half of all foreign criminals caught in the UK have a right to stay that prevents them being deported, Britain’s top police officer said yesterday. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned that the criminal justice system is not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration. A third of crimes in London are committed by foreign offenders, the Met chief said. But the majority are EU citizens who may have the freedom to travel between and live in all member states. Sir Bernard said police must do more to stop those banned from Britain getting in and to kick out those who should no longer be here. Speaking at a conference on foreign offenders, he said: ‘Over the course of 12 months, approximately 80,000 foreign nationals will enter our custody suites. ‘A large proportion of them – in fact more than half – are from the European Union and have a right of entry and a right of abode. So any suggestion of deporting foreign nationals who we arrest is more complicated than it appears.’ Police still struggle to obtain fast and accurate information on foreign suspects that have been arrested. They fear dangerous criminals and persistent offenders are slipping through the net as a result, he said. The Met has been running a pilot scheme to bridge the information gap which has seen more than 2,000 migrants kicked out, at least 100 of them from Poland and Romania. Sir Bernard said: ‘We cannot accept the risk of a foreign national wanted or suspected of serious crime, be it rape, robbery or murder, walking from our custody suite unidentified. The systems, partnerships and processes that we secure must provide not only accurate information and intelligence – but must do so at the speed with which we need them.’ Earlier this year the Government pledged that arrested foreign nationals – including EU citizens – will face deportation even if they are not convicted of any crime. The crackdown will use a European law that states those wanting to remain here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient. This could be used to tackle groups such as the capital’s notorious Park Lane beggars, a group largely from Eastern European countries such as Romania. In London, border guards have recently removed 44 Polish nationals, 64 Romanians and two Bulgarians, all either suspected offenders or criminals. A further 142 EU nationals, or those with EU rights, are being investigated with a view to removing them. A foreign criminal allowed to stay in the UK despite a history of violent offences brutally assaulted a woman while his deportation case was being heard. Sanel Sahbaz, 31, was cleared of raping his victim who is in her 20s and cannot be named. But the jury was unaware the Bosnian had admitted a three-month campaign of terror against her last autumn. Judge Marie Catterson adjourned sentence for reports but told Sahbaz: ‘It must be obvious to you that you can expect nothing but a custodial sentence.’ Sahbaz had been jailed three times for previous offences and had faced automatic deportation. But his lawyers successfully argued last August that his human rights would be violated if he was returned to Bosnia as he would be separated from his parents, who are also in Britain – even though he still has an extended family in his homeland. A relative of the victim criticised the decision to allow him to remain in the UK, saying: ‘If he hadn’t been here he wouldn’t have been able to attack her.’ Sanel Sahbaz, 31, was cleared of raping his victim who is in her 20s and cannot be named.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Jimmy Savile, who died in 2011. Expensive litigation threatens to engulf his entire £3.3million legacy . Taxpayers face a growing bill for Jimmy Savile’s crimes because of a bitter and expensive dispute over his estate. Lawyers have already racked up six-figure costs as they squabble over the compensation scheme for victims of the sick sexual predator who died in 2011. The expensive litigation, which has already dragged on for 20 months, threatens to engulf his entire £3.3million legacy. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the public purse will underwrite any claims not met by Savile’s estate, for which NatWest is the executor. This could be extremely costly as compensation could run into tens of millions of pounds. Law firms have already taken on almost 200 victims but there are believed to be around 500 in total who could each claim up to £60,000 compensation – giving a maximum bill, in theory, of £30million. However, many will receive far less than £60,000 while others may not choose to claim at all. Nevertheless, the latest explosion of disgust over Savile’s vile activities in hospitals over almost 50 years is likely to motivate another wave of people to come forward. It emerged this week that Savile boasted of stealing glass eyes from bodies, performed sex acts on corpses and may even have been involved in the death of a teenage girl. One source close to the legal row said: ‘The legal fees on both sides are huge and the lawyers for the estate are fighting it every step of the way. 'It is the bank doing everything it can to protect the money and themselves from the possible impact of the compensation claims.’ Another added: ‘We are trying our hardest to make sure legal costs do not swallow the estate, but invoices worth hundreds of thousands have already been paid out.’ The bitter dispute brought all parties to the High Court earlier this year as they fought to thrash out an acceptable compensation scheme. Law firms have already taken on almost 200 of Savile's (pictured) victims but there are believed to be around 500 in total who could each claim up to £60,000 compensation - giving a maximum bill, in theory, of £30million . Mr Justice Sales sanctioned a scheme brought forward by NatWest, which does not guarantee payouts but creates a ‘sliding scale’ framework within which claims can be judged on their merits. The money will be paid out  from Savile’s estate, if any is  left, and the coffers of the NHS, Department for Education and BBC, all of which have been accused of turning a blind eye to his crimes. Savile’s estate has been frozen but his will left £20,000 between 20 friends, family and neighbours. The money will be paid out from Savile's estate, if any is left, and the coffers of the NHS, Department for Education and BBC (pictured), all of which have been accused of turning a blind eye to his crimes . A further £600,000 was set aside for a trust fund which benefited eight people, and the remainder was to be held on behalf of the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust. A NatWest spokesman said: ‘The estate is under the overriding supervision of the High Court and we will continue to do everything possible to support a resolution that is in the interests of all parties. ‘It is important that we balance the interests of the beneficiaries and claimants and preserve as much money in the estate as possible to meet the claims of those entitled to it.’","Lawyers rack-up six-figure bill as they squabble over compensation deal .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Voluntary policemen should be issued with Tasers, a senior officer said last night. James Deller, a leading special constable, said he and other volunteers face the same risks as ordinary officers and need the same protection. He said the 50,000-volt weapons were a highly effective deterrent against dangerous criminals who do not distinguish between specials and regular officers. A Thames Valley police officer brandishes a Taser: Voluntary policemen should also be issued with Tasers, a senior officer said last night, because they face the same dangers on the job as their full-time colleagues . His comments came as the police watchdog said more officers than ever are armed with stun guns, which are being fired at record rates. The Independent Police Complaints Commission warned the devices should not become the normal way of controlling violent suspects. Mr Deller, an assistant chief officer for the Met in London, said specials already carried a baton, handcuffs and incapacitant spray. But he said Tasers can make a ‘dramatic difference’ and some specials are attached to teams where every other officer has one. ‘Specials face the same risks as their regular colleagues day in, day out. They may not do it all the time but the public do not distinguish between us,’ he added. ‘This is about equipping officers with the tools to do the job, as long as they are appropriately trained, appropriately selected and appropriately deployed. ‘It doesn’t matter that you only work four hours a week when you are staring at a man with a knife.’ Mr Deller, who has more than 20 years of experience, spoke out after Staffordshire Police decided against allowing trained specials to have Tasers. The force backed down from a proposed pilot scheme amid criticism from campaign groups and frontline police representatives. The move would have been a considerable further expansion of the weapon’s use since it was introduced in Britain in 2003. At first only firearms officers were handed Tasers but their availability has soared so that one in ten officers are trained to wield one. Many forces have invested huge sums in the potentially deadly stun guns that are fired an average of five times a day across all forces. The number of confrontations involving Tasers more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, from 3,500 to 7,250. Mr Deller's comments came as the police watchdog said more officers than ever are armed with stun guns . Tasers operate by firing two metal barbs into a person, delivering a jolt of electricity that immobilises them by overcoming their central nervous system. Yesterday, the IPCC said police must be able to justify the use of the weapons every time they are used. It called for clearer guidance on the use of Tasers on those in custody and vulnerable people, including children and those with mental illness. Officials again highlighted concerns about the use of the weapons in ‘drive stun’ mode, in which they cause excruciating pain through direct contact with the skin. They found several cases in which the use of a Taser in this manner further inflamed a violent confrontation. The watchdog continues to investigate three high-profile deaths in which Tasers may have played a part. These include that of Andrew Pimlott who suffered horrific injuries in a fireball after dousing himself in fuel in his Plymouth garden last year. Cindy Butts, of the IPCC, said there were legitimate reasons for firing Tasers in the most difficult and challenging situations. But she added that police forces must ensure they do not become a ‘default choice’, particularly when methods as simple as  talking to suspects could be equally effective.","The weapons are an effective deterrent, claims leading special constable .

"By . Chris Greenwood . He has ambitions to follow in the footsteps of his famously clean-cut father, BBC football pundit Gary Lineker. But after being caught drunk behind the wheel while going for a 5am McDonald’s, 20-year-old Harry Lineker appears to have scored an own goal. The former public schoolboy made a grovelling apology yesterday after police saw him driving erratically and found he was over the legal alcohol limit. Banned: Harry Lineker, 20, arrives at court with his mother Michelle, right, where he admitted having three pints then driving to McDonald's . Looking for work: Harry Lineker told the court he hoped to get a job at the BBC in football. His father earns £1.5million a year presenting Match of the Day . Harry, who defended himself in court, was banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pay £635 in fines and costs after admitting his guilt. In court he wore a dark suit, but as he arrived and left he also wore a back-to-front baseball cap over his long hair. On his way in he also smoked a cigarette. The resemblance to his father was clear as he arrived at court with his mother Michelle Cockayne, 48, his father’s first wife, who had to cover her head with her coat when they were caught in a rain shower. Harry – who describes himself on his Facebook page as an ‘international man of leisure’ since leaving £34,000-a-year Charterhouse School – is the second of the couple’s four sons. His father, who retired from football in 1994 with 80 England caps, is in Brazil hosting the BBC’s World Cup coverage. Harry has enjoyed some of the benefits of Gary’s celebrity status, appearing at movie premieres and joining his older brother George at West End nightclubs. Speaking about his lifestyle, Harry told the court he did not go to university and has been unemployed for two years but said he wants to ‘get a job in TV sport’. He said he would like to do ‘anything in sport. I’m looking for different experiences, try out and see what I’m doing from that. ‘I want to try and get a job at the BBC, in journalism, anything like that – preferably football and other sports as well.’ Sons: Gary Lineker 53, at a December 2013 film premiere with Harry, far left and his other children (left to right) Angus, George and Tobias . ‘I live with my mum,’ he said. ‘I don’t get an allowance, I live at home and if I go out I get some money.’ He said his mother would pay the fine and his court costs within seven days. Asked if he had anything else to say, he replied: ‘That I’m really sorry, I thought I was fine and I apologise.’ He was arrested after police spotted his silver VW Polo clipping a roundabout in Wandsworth, south west London, at 5.20am on April 12. Darren Wabbs, prosecuting, told Hammersmith magistrates: ‘He was seen by officers driving in an erratic fashion. The vehicle was seen swerving across the road, stopping half way down and performing a turn in the road. Officers followed it for a distance, the driver wandered slightly over the white line along the road and caught the corner of the roundabout.’ Harry was pulled over and failed a roadside breath test. A further blood test at a police station revealed he had 86mg of alcohol in 100ml of his blood. The legal limit is 80ml. Out of work: Lineker told the court he lived with his mother, and apologised for driving while over the limit . Harry told the court he had had a few drinks in the evening and thought he was able to drive legally. He said: ‘I had three pints with friends the night before, went back to the house and watched videos. About three hours later I went down the road to get some food from McDonald’s on Wandsworth roundabout. I thought I was fine.’ District Judge Devinder Sandhu fined him £500 with £85 costs and a £50 victim surcharge. She said: ‘This was incredibly foolish. It’s all too clear the consequences of when people like you drink drive. ‘You were lucky there was not an accident that day and equally lucky that nobody else was injured from your driving.’ Gary Lineker, 53, has three other sons, George, 22, Tobias, 18, and Angus, 16. He split from their mother in 2006 and married model Danielle Bux in September 2009. The TV presenter advertises Walkers crisps alongside his media career and is estimated to have a £30million fortune. Earlier this year he said he keeps tabs on his two eldest sons’ driving with electronic ‘black box’ recorders he had fitted to their vehicles. ‘Every now and again I will suddenly see something where they are driving too fast or they are braking too sharply,’ he said. Out of the country: Gary Lineker is currently in Brazil for the World Cup presenting the BBC's coverage .","The unemployed 20-year-old was banned from road for a year and fined £500 .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Peter McKelvie, 65, said senior politicians, military figures and even people linked to the Royal Family were among the alleged abusers . At least 20 high-profile members of the British Establishment formed a VIP paedophile ring that abused children for decades, a whistleblower claimed last night. Peter McKelvie, 65, said senior politicians, military figures and even people linked to the Royal Family were among the alleged abusers. The campaigner, who first raised the alarm about prominent individuals engaged in child sex abuse two years ago, said the conspiracy may have been going on for 65 years. Speaking in public for the first time in 20 years, the former local authority child protection chief said there were still people in power who had been involved in child abuse two decades ago. While working in Hereford and Worcester, he helped to convict notorious child abuser Peter Righton – once one of the country’s most respected authorities on child care. Righton, who is now dead, was also a founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) – which tried to decriminalise sex between children and adults, before he was convicted of importing child abuse images. Mr McKelvie told police in 2012 that seven boxes of potential evidence about Righton were being stored by West Mercia Police, and that these might contain evidence of further abuse by senior members of the establishment. He told the BBC: ‘For the last 30 years – and longer than that – there have been a number of allegations made by survivors that people at the top of very powerful institutions in this country, which include politicians, judges, senior military figures and even people that have links with the Royal Family, have been involved in the abuse of children. ‘At the most serious level, we’re talking about the brutal rape of young boys.’ Mr McKelvie said the child abusers made up a ‘small percentage’ of the British Establishment, but ‘a slightly larger percentage’ knew about it but did not report it to the police. He said these people ‘felt that’ in terms of their own self-interest and self-preservation and for political party reasons, it has been safer for them to cover it up than deal with it.’ Child abuser Peter Righton was once one of the country¿s most respected authorities on child care . The retired civil servant said he had once tried to blow the whistle with a ‘very prominent figure’ in the Labour Party when the party was in opposition, but ‘nothing came of it’. Mr McKelvie also took his concerns to Labour MP Tom Watson, who then raised the matter in Parliament two years ago. His comments prompted the Scotland Yard inquiry known as Operation Fairbank, into claims of a paedophile network linked to Downing Street. Speaking on the BBC’s Newsnight, Mr McKelvie added: ‘Over many years I’ve spoken to a considerable number of victims and most recently victims of perhaps the most powerful elite group of paedophiles. ‘Because the worst part of sexual abuse is the power that powerful people have over them. And they don’t believe that power can ever be broken.’ The evidence from West Mercia Police includes letters between Righton, who was a consultant to the National Children’s Bureau before he was unmasked, and other suspected paedophiles. He welcomed the two inquiries ordered on Monday by Home Secretary Theresa May but said the allegations should have been taken up ‘a very long time ago’. He said: ‘At last there is the very real prospect of survivors and victims having justice. I believe that there is strong evidence and an awful lot of information that can be converted into evidence if it is investigated properly. 'There has been an extremely powerful elite, among the highest levels of the political classes, for as long as I have been alive – and I am 65 now. ‘There has been sufficient reason to investigate it over and over again – certainly for the last 30 years – and there has always been the block, the cover-up and the collusion to prevent that.’ Mark Sedwill, permanent secretary at the Home Office . The Lib Dems, Tories and Labour were last night forced to agree to trawl through their records for evidence that party whips covered up historic allegations of child abuse against MPs. A senior civil servant last night insisted all public bodies – including political parties – should carry out a sweep of their documents for any evidence of a conspiracy of silence. Mark Sedwill, permanent secretary at the Home Office, said ‘all bodies’ should carry out investigations to see whether they hold files or evidence relevant to a new, wide-ranging inquiry into historic paedophile allegations. He told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee this included the offices of party whips – the senior MPs in charge of discipline in political parties. His intervention raises the prospect of current and former MPs who served as whips being questioned about what they knew of rumours or allegations against colleagues. They have long been said to hold ‘little black books’ containing damaging information against colleagues they want to control. Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems indicated last night that they would co-operate in full. This week Labour MP Lisa Nandy raised in the Commons remarks by the late Conservative MP Tim Fortescue, who was a whip in Edward Heath’s government between 1970 and 1973. He said in a 1995 documentary that MPs ‘in trouble’ would ask the whips’ office for help when in difficulty. Mr Fortescue, who died aged 92 in 2008, claimed he could assist MPs with scandals, including those ‘involving small boys’, to exert control over them later and make sure they followed the party line. He said: ‘For anyone with any sense, who was in trouble, would come to the whips and tell them the truth, and say now, “I’m in a jam, can you help?”. ‘We would do everything we can because we would store up Brownie points. That sounds a pretty, pretty nasty reason, but if we could get a chap out of trouble then he will do as we ask forever more.’ Former Conservative chief whip Mr Heath pioneered the keeping of a ‘dirt book’ about MPs’ private lives for his political advantage. Conservative MP Mark Reckless suggested there should be checks to ensure that whips’ offices co-operated with any police inquiries into historic abuse allegations. He said a debate in the Nineties about whether whips’ notes were personal or government property had led to a new shredding procedure. A Tory spokesman said: ‘Conservative whips will review their records and co-operate fully.’ Labour said: ‘We will do everything in our power to help the inquiry.’ The Lib Dems said: ‘We will cooperate with the inquiries in whatever way we can.’","Peter McKelvie, 65, first raised alarm about the child abuse two years ago .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and James Slack . Dangerous precedent: Labour MP David Winnick said MPs must be given a chance to debate whether aa major terrorism trial should be held in secret . MPs from across the political spectrum yesterday condemned plans to hold a major terrorism trial in secret and called for an urgent parliamentary debate on the growing controversy. The case – in which a judge declared he would try two suspected terrorists entirely behind closed doors – was described as a ‘dangerous precedent’ which will change the British legal landscape forever. His momentous decision – a legal first – was revealed only after this newspaper and other media organisations challenged it at the Court of Appeal. Last night, Labour MP David Winnick, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said MPs must be given a chance to debate such an important matter. ‘Parliament should be very concerned indeed that the proceedings are to be held entirely in private for the first time in centuries,’ he said. ‘If this goes ahead, it may well be the case that in future the argument will be made that there is justification for other cases to be so heard. ‘I wouldn’t challenge the fact that some of the evidence may be sensitive and there is an argument for some of the evidence to be taken in private, but to take the whole case in private is, to say the least, unfortunate.’ Other trials, often involving spies or state secrets, have been held partly in secret. The two men, known only as AB and CD, are due to enter a dock at the Old Bailey on June 16 accused of a terror plot. The trial judge, Mr Justice Nicol, has ruled the case will be held in secret and the public will not even know the men’s names for unknown ‘national security’ reasons. A draconian gagging order, which prevented the media reporting even the existence of the case, was overturned at the Court of Appeal by three top judges. They are now considering whether to uphold the secrecy bid. Yesterday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling insisted he is ‘very confident’ the judges will act in the ‘interests of justice’. He told the BBC: ‘I know our senior judiciary very well. I know that they will want to protect the interests of justice, and I am very confident that if they take a decision on a very difficult matter like this, they will do so in the interests of justice. Outspoken: Judge Sir Andrew Nicol . The top judge behind Britain’s first ever secret trial has been an outspoken advocate of open justice throughout his career. Sir Andrew Nicol is an expert on media law and co-author of several books in which he makes clear justice must be seen to be done. And he has previously boasted that the courts, unlike the machinations of government, are not ‘swathed in secrecy’. But Sir Andrew, referred to in court as Mr Justice Nicol, also points out that the right to an open trial is ‘not unqualified’. Writing five years ago, he said a trial could be held wholly or partly in secret for national security reasons, to uphold  public order or even in the ‘interests of morals’. Mr Justice Nicol has presided over a series of high profile  trials, including the acquittal of a Tottenham man accused of  murdering PC Keith Blakelock earlier this year. 'In this particular case, if there is really good reason, if it is in the interests of justice for the judge to decide in one way or the other, so be it.’ But MPs and campaigners said they have grave reservations that secret justice could leave lingering uncomfortable questions over the outcome of the trial. David Blunkett, a former home secretary, said he was ‘mystified’ by the decision, and that it amounted to a ‘removal of open justice’. David Blunkett, a former home secretary, said he was 'mystified' by the decision . ‘In some cases, there can be justification in terms of the kind of evidence which requires presenting in secret, but it would appear that there is no clarification as to whether this is the case here,’ he said. Tory MP Dominic Raab branded secret trials ‘illiberal and anti-British’. ‘The Government must explain why this is necessary to protect national security,’ he said. Lord Macdonald, a Liberal Democrat peer and a former director of public prosecutions, said justice must be seen to be done ‘99.9 per cent of the time’, but added ‘exceptional circumstances’ could justify the secrecy. Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said the courts must find a way to lift the ‘cloak of secrecy’ as much as possible to avoid public confidence being undermined. He added: ‘While there will always be exceptional circumstances in which parts of cases may need to be held in secret, very important questions need answering as to why in this instance the whole case needs be held in secret.’ The Court of Appeal ruling will be made public ‘within days’. Last night, David Anderson QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, said the media is ‘absolutely right’ to challenge the secrecy. He said: ‘We’ve always operated on the principle that justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done.’ But he added ‘there is no reason it shouldn’t be a fair trial’ because a jury, the judge and defendants will all hear the evidence against them.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Hate preacher Abu Hamza plotted to set up a headquarters for the Taliban at Finsbury Park Mosque, a court was told. The hook-handed cleric wanted to use it as a London base for an operation to send up to 3,000 supporters to Afghanistan. The plan was revealed in a letter to a leader of the extremist group written by a key Hamza aide just three days after the 9/11 attacks. A court sketch shows Abu Hamsa with his legal team in Manhattan federal court in New York last month, where the letter written by Hamza's aide about the UK al-Qaeda base was revealed . In the memo, US-born convert James Ujaama, who was sent by Hamza from London to Afghanistan, offers the assistance of ‘devout Muslims’ in Britain. He told Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, the then Taliban foreign minister, that they wanted to pledge their allegiance in person to Mullah Omar, the one-eyed Taliban leader. The letter was presented among prosecution exhibits at a courthouse in New York where Hamza is on trial for terrorism-related offences. The jury is expected to deliver its verdicts as early as today. If found guilty, Abu Hamza faces life behind bars at a maximum security American prison. On trial: If found guilty, Abu Hamz, pictured in 2003, faces life behind bars at a maximum security American prison .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Charged: Patrick Rock is accused of four offences and will face magistrates next week . A key member of David Cameron’s ‘inner circle’ was yesterday accused of hoarding sexual images of naked children. Four months after his arrest and dramatic resignation from Downing Street, Patrick Rock, 63, was charged with possessing 59 indecent images. The Whitehall veteran is also accused of ‘making’ indecent photographs of children, which can mean manipulating the images in some way. He will appear before magistrates next week after a lengthy investigation by specialist investigators at the National Crime Agency (NCA). The charges are an embarrassment for the Prime Minister, who declined to comment on the matter while speaking at a press conference in Brussels yesterday. Rock, formerly deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and a protege of Margaret Thatcher, was one  of Mr Cameron’s closest confidantes. The two men have known each other for two decades and worked side by side for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s. The public servant was involved in drawing up Government policy on filters designed to block vile images of child abuse. And his seniority was demonstrated by the fact that he was one of only three advisers given his own private office in Number 10. Rock was arrested at his flat in Fulham, west London, on February 13 after suspicious colleagues called in police. Officers from the NCA – which aspires to be known as Britain’s FBI – searched his office and removed his laptop and other computer equipment. In a statement, it said Rock is accused of possessing and making indecent images of children between July 31 and August 31 last year. An NCA spokesman said: ‘The images have been assessed by NCA officers and Crown Prosecution Service lawyers as meeting the definition of level C.’ Level C images are the lowest level of indecent images of children and are generally described as ‘erotic posing’ involving naked or partially clothed victims. According to official guidelines, people convicted of possessing this category of images are likely to receive a community penalty. The Prime Minister said in Brussels: 'I won't be saying anything. It will be purely a matter for the courts' Judith Reed, of the CPS, said: ‘The decision to prosecute has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. ‘We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.’ The investigation has been dogged by controversy because of a decision by NCA boss Keith Bristow to cloak it in extreme secrecy. The fledgling agency, which says it aims to be open and transparent, refused to confirm or deny Rock’s arrest or the existence of any inquiry until yesterday. The sensitive investigation was only made public weeks after it began when it was revealed by this newspaper. The refusal to discuss the Rock case contrasts with the policy of every other police force, which is always to confirm arrests. Leaders at the College of Policing insist it is in the public interest to do so and are privately mystified by the NCA’s approach. It is understood that NCA policy was shaped by the Leveson Inquiry, which included proposals to rein in the Press. The move highlights concerns that the inquiry into Press standards is letting police and other officials withhold information from the public. Rock was released on bail and will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on July 3.

"By . Chris Greenwood . The leaking of secret surveillance techniques by Edward Snowden has made the world a more dangerous place, a top officer warned last night. Cressida Dick said the former US National Security Agency contractor’s disclosures, printed by The Guardian newspaper, caused ‘enormous damage’ and ‘hand[ed] the advantage to terrorists’. The Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner added: ‘The so-called Snowden revelations have made our work more difficult. The actions he took helped to signal to people who may try to do us harm  how to avoid surveillance and other techniques. Former CIA agent Edward Snowden made the world a more dangerous place . through leaking secret surveillance techniques, a top officer has warned . ‘In my view that is not going to make the world safer, it is going to make it more dangerous. It has affected public confidence in our abilities to do a job that I believe we do carefully, proportionately and using our powers sparingly within the law.’ Speaking to a meeting of police chiefs in her last days as Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Miss Dick said the police were ‘staring into the abyss’ because of a political deadlock over access to sensitive internet communications. Terrorists and other top-level criminals were taking advantage of rapidly changing technology to evade the security services. Cressida Dick, Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner, told police chiefs that the leaks had affected public confidence in police abilities . Politicians must get to grips with laws allowing police to use so-called ‘communications data’, Miss Dick said, adding that terrorist investigations will be hampered unless police and spies can retain data, including internet browsing and emails. She said: ‘I believe that as technology changes, we are beginning to stare into the abyss. Make no mistake, continuing erosion of this capability without the necessary legislative changes will severely impact on our ability to continue terrorist investigations.’ Asked about the outbreak of extreme violence in Iraq, Miss Dick said the security services were watching the ‘ghastly conflagration’ closely. She said: ‘It is clearly an enormous world-changing event which will have all sorts of ramifications and it may or may not heighten the risk to the UK of terrorism.’ She added that police had no information yet that British jihadists have travelled from Syria to join the wave of barbaric Islamist fighters. But she said police were conscious that hundreds of Britons fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad could move and threaten other areas in  the world. Miss Dick also appealed to the Government to leave terrorism units in the hands of police forces, including the Met, rather than hand them to the National Crime Agency. She said a ‘messy divorce’ risked making the police response to complex terrorist threats less effective and more difficult to co-ordinate.","Former CIA agent Edward Snowden leaked secret surveillance techniques .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Rebecca Evans . and Gerri Peev . A Facebook paedophile who is described as ‘every parent’s nightmare’ has escaped being sent to jail. Timothy Storey, 34, appeared the perfect middle-class husband yet groomed hundreds of children on the social networking site. By posing online as a privately-educated teenager, he persuaded girls as young as 12 to film themselves naked for his twisted pleasure. Alias: Using the name 'Tim Stone' and this picture of him as a younger man, Storey forced girls to film themselves . Storey, who is married to an Oxford-educated lawyer although they have been separated for over a year, would threaten to tell the girls’ parents if they tried to end the vile abuse. Despite being convicted of eight child sex charges, he was given only a three-year rehabilitation order. MPs and charities said the ‘appalling’ sentence sent out a terrible message to the young victims brave enough to give evidence against him. The case was last night referred to Attorney General Dominic Grieve by Tory MP David Burrowes. He said: ‘The sentence is woefully inadequate and out of touch with the increasing dangers of online sexual abuse.’ The MP has backed the Mail’s campaign for automatic blocks on online porn unless adults opt out. To his family and friends, Storey was an ordinary young man with a love of beer and cricket and married to the love of his life. They had a dream wedding in 2010. Behind the facade he was secretly spending hours on Facebook, posing as a wealthy and sporty prep school teenager called Tim Stone. On his fake Facebook profile, Storey claimed he left Dover College – an independent boarding school which charges up to £27,000 a year – in 2011. Dozens of teenagers can still be seen . as his friends on Facebook, many of them posing in provocative clothing. Storey lists ‘sexercise, girls and naughtiness’ among his interests. The . police investigation began last year when a 14-year-old girl told . officers a Tim Stone had sent her sexual images via Facebook two years . earlier. She said he asked . her to send sexual images in return. Officers at Scotland Yard’s . specialist child exploitation unit quickly discovered that Storey was . responsible for the account. When police raided his home they discovered he had falsely amassed almost 800 Facebook friends, all of them girls aged under 18. He had sent hundreds of private messages to them asking them to send him explicit images of themselves and sent images of his genitals in return. They discovered another victim, a 13-year-old girl, was encouraged to set up a Skype account which he used to make her strip and display intimate parts of her body. The girl said she was scared and believed Storey knew where she lived and would tell her parents. The girl confided in a 13-year-old friend who told Storey to back off. But, in a chilling twist, this girl and another friend became his victims too. After raiding Storey’s home in Peckham, South East London, police discovered more than 3,000 saved pages of Skype chat which helped them identify further victims. Seventy-two indecent images of children were found on a laptop and on Storey’s Blackberry mobile phone. He admitted eight counts of inciting children to engage in sexual activity and two counts of making indecent images of children. Storey, who is originally from Folkestone, Kent, was sentenced to a 36-month sex offender’s programme at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday. He was also handed a sexual offences . prevention order, which is similar to an Asbo, and ordered to sign the . sex offenders register for five years. Under . the latest guidelines, the maximum penalty for inciting a child under . 13 to engage in sexual activity is 14 years behind bars. Storey was sentenced to a 36-month sex offender's programme at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday . This . is reduced substantially if there is no physical contact. But Mr . Burrowes said: ‘The impact of predators on child victims is the same . whether online or in person. Sentences should reflect that equivalence.’ Priti Patel, another Tory MP, said: ‘It is appalling that such a soft sentence has been given for what is overt internet grooming and dangerous behaviour that threatens the safety of our children. ‘This reflects the failure in our criminal justice system when it comes to dealing with the internet. ‘We . need firm and clear sentences to be handed out to individuals who are . clearly abusing youngsters in such a horrific and vile way online.’ John . Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: . ‘Storey is obviously a dangerous man and a lot of people will be . surprised with the leniency of this sentence. ‘A . lot of people will think he should be in prison. People are noticing . that fewer and fewer of these offenders are going to jail. It seems . there has been a shift in sentencing process without a change in . sentencing policy.’ Detective Inspector Neal Burton, who investigated the case, believes Storey claimed many more victims. ‘He . is every parent’s nightmare, exploiting and abusing children over the . internet,’ he said. ‘The victims showed much courage in coming forward . to report his activities and helping to bring him to justice. 'The impact on child victims is the same whether online or in person. Sentences should reflect that' MP David Burrowes . ‘He is a serial sex offender who I believe may have abused other victims who have not yet come forward and spoken to the police or confided in anyone else.’ The case is the latest to highlight the frightening trend of paedophiles using Facebook and other sites. The Government has been warned that social networking and webcams are handing predators direct access to the bedrooms of naive children.","Timothy Storey, 34, convicted of 8 child sex charges, handed 'rehab' order .

"By . Chris Greenwood . A schoolboy burglar used his angelic looks to 'dupe' generous elderly people as he terrorised wealthy neighbourhoods. The prolific criminal was just 12 years old when he joined a gang targeting vulnerable residents in some of the UK's most affluent areas. He was used as a 'frontman', knocking on doors claiming to have lost a toy or that he needed to borrow a pencil and paper. As he distracted kind-spirited victims, an accomplice would break in and steal as much cash and jewellery as they could carry. This boy, 12, was used as a 'frontman' for a burglary gang targeting pensioners in London, Kent and Surrey . Police suspect they escaped with a . haul worth tens of thousands of pounds as they targeted dozens of . households across London, Surrey and Kent. In . many cases their victims were elderly or disabled, including a widow . whose irreplaceable engagement ring – worn for more than 50 years – was . snatched. They were left . terrified with some telling police they are now too scared to sleep . without the light on. Others said they were humiliated after being taken . in by such a young child. At . court, the boy – now aged 13 – was initially barred from the room by . officials who said he was too young to be allowed inside. Once . they realised he was the defendant, the 5ft-tall thief, who was dressed . in a shirt and tie, was allowed to sit at the back with a chaperone. The boy was brought to justice after being caught on CCTV close to the scene of one burglary in Kingston, South West London, last July. Detectives eventually linked him to 48 similar burglaries spanning the South East of England between June and September 2013. They suspect the gang are behind many more raids as they effectively worked 'full time', racking up hundreds of miles as they searched for victims. Accomplice Michael Doran was jailed for nine years and six months for his role in the burglary spree . In each case the boy was used to . distract anyone who answered the door while Michael Doran, 39, ransacked . their homes. A third burglar was used as a getaway driver. Raids . took place in Carlshalton and Kingston, in Surrey, Dartford in Kent, . and across London, including Kensington, West Dulwich, Lambeth and . Bromley. In one case in . Greenwich, a huge haul of precious jewellery was stolen from an . 82-year-old widow when she answered her door to the boy. It included her blue sapphire and . diamond engagement ring as well as gold rings and necklaces given to her . by her husband during their life together. Prosecutor . Simon Sandford said: 'She was very upset. The jewellery was bought by . her late husband and held many memories which she can never get back.' In . another case, a 62-year-old disabled man lost a valuable watch and £400 . cash when the boy knocked on the door of his Dartford home claiming to . have lost his ball. Geraldine Ward, 36, was jailed for three years after admitting acting as a driver . Jailed: Geraldine Ward, pictured here on CCTV using stolen cards for cash . When he went back inside he found a man rifling through his belongings in his bedroom. He shouted at him and the pair ran off. Ordering him to undertake a one year rehabilitation order, Judge Ruth Downing said only his youth was saving him from prison. She said: 'The burglary of someone by knocking on their door and distracting them is a very unpleasant offence. 'It preys on people's good faith and belief that someone needs help, that they really want a glass of water, or pencil and paper or that a ball really is in their back garden. 'Then their trust is abused and their home invaded and items of real value, both emotional, sentimental and monetary, were taken. 'These were very serious offences which I regard as vile, in many ways because of the way it preyed on the people in question. Michael Doran (left) and Geraldine Ward (right) were jailed earlier this month for their role in the burglary spree . 'If you had participated in them as a grown up, or even aged 17 or 18, you would be losing your liberty in this court.' The burglar was sentenced at high-security Woolwich Crown Court after admitting conspiracy to commit burglary in relation to 10 raids. The boy, who has spikey, jelled hair, was accompanied by two social workers, a youth offending expert, two police officers and several relatives. He spent the one-hour hearing playing with his tie and staring at the clock, speaking only to say 'yes miss' when they judge asked if he understood. Addressing him directly, Judge Downing said she feared the 'complicated and complex' proceedings would 'go over the top of your head.' The sentence, which will be enforced by a local offending team, includes reparation work, counselling and weekly classes aimed at illustrating the impact of his crimes. Earlier this month his accomplice Michael Doran was jailed for nine years and six months for his role in the burglary spree. Doran's partner Geraldine Ward, 36, was jailed for three years after admitting acting as a driver. She also pawned the stolen jewellery for cash and withdrew cash using stolen bank cards. Mr Sandford said vulnerable victims of the burglaries have been left reeling and upset. He said: 'They are not comfortable in their homes and feel embarrassed that they have been taken in as a dupe by this boy. Many of them fear sleeping alone and leave the lights on at night.' Speaking after the case, DC Kevin Seed, of the Met, said: 'These burglaries were pre-planned and this pair targeted mainly elderly residents, many with serious health and mobility issues. 'Doran and Ward ruthlessly selected their victims and the use of a young boy to commit these offences shows how they took advantage of their victim's kindness and good nature. 'The lengthy sentences they have received reflects the seriousness of the offences they carried out and shows the police nor will the courts tolerate these types of crimes.' His colleague DC Kerry Townley added: 'We very much hope that the 13-year-old boy is rehabilitated and does not come to our notice again. We hope that he does change his life for the better.'","Gang targeted households across London, Surrey and Kent .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Mark Duell . Dishevelled, overweight and struggling to walk, Freddie Starr yesterday lashed out at police and prosecutors after a sex case against him was finally dropped. The 71-year-old TV entertainer signalled he will sue for compensation after he was released from bail more than 18 months after his first arrest. Prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of 13 women that he molested them up to 40 years ago. Scroll down fro video . Struggle: Freddie Starr outside his home in Warwickshire last week week after the CPS confirmed that he will not be charged as part of Operation Yewtree due to insufficient evidence . Compensation: Starr (right), 71, and his lawyer Dean Dunham (left), both said he would mount a legal case against police . Media statement: A frail-looking Starr appeared briefly outside his home in Warwickshire alongside Mr Dunham . In the car: Starr arriving at his home in Warwickshire, driven by his wife. The CPS confirmed that he will not be charged . They . added that although there was enough material in a 14th case for a . ‘realistic prospect of conviction’ it would not be in the public . interest to go to court. Starr, . whose health has deteriorated so much he has needed a wheelchair during . the investigation, criticised the authorities after the decision. Speaking at his Warwickshire village mansion, his lawyer Dean Dunham . said: ‘This will not be the end of this matter. ‘I’ll . tell you this, we will not be sitting down and letting this go as it is . now. The police have some questions to answer and they will be . answering them. Assistance: Starr (left) is helped back into his home by his lawyer Mr Dunham after talking to the media . ‘They do . need to be accountable – I wouldn’t like to see anyone else go through . what Freddie has been through. In this case, it wasn’t justified. ‘There . was simply never ever enough evidence in this matter that was anywhere . near sufficient to keep a man on bail for 18 months.’ Starr . was the second celebrity to be arrested by Scotland Yard’s Operation . Yewtree when he was held on November 1, 2012. He was re-arrested four . times and re-bailed nine times as the controversial investigation . engulfed his generation of celebrities. The . comedian accused police and prosecutors of ‘playing dirty’ by . associating him with known paedophiles Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter. Starr . was one of the most high-profile and outspoken Yewtree suspects and the . decision to release him is a major blow for an inquiry which some have . branded a ‘witch-hunt’. It comes just days after detectives secured . their first conviction when publicist Max Clifford was found guilty of a . string of  sex attacks. Freddie Starr and his wife Sophie in 2011. Starr will not be prosecuted after spending 18 months on bail . Looking much healthier: Comedian Starr is pictured two decades ago in 1997 (left) and 1995 (right) Heyday: Starr in December 1984. His lawyer has accused police of a 'flagrant breach' of Starr's human rights . Starr . suspects the announcement was delayed by the Clifford case, because his . notorious front page story – ‘Freddie Starr ate my hamster’ – featured . in the evidence. But prosecutors insist they only made their final . decision late last week and did not receive a full case file from police . until March. Clearly in . poor health, Starr spoke only to say ‘I feel relieved’ as he faced the . media yesterday. But his lawyer aimed a strongly-worded volley of . criticism at the authorities whom he accused of orchestrating a . ‘harrowing’ ordeal. Mr . Dunham said: ‘It has taken too long; it has not been done properly. We . presented evidence right at the start of this matter  that we say was . conclusive to show  that he was not guilty of these allegations.’ The . claims against Starr first came to light just weeks after the Savile . scandal first exploded in October 2012. Starr made a failed attempt to . secure a High Court injunction to restrict media reporting of the claim . and hired private investigators to examine it. The decision leaves only a handful of Yewtree suspects on bail, including Glitter, who was arrested five days before Starr. Others . include BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini, and former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning. Comic Jimmy Tarbuck was arrested and spent nearly a year on bail before . being told he would not face charges, while Jim Davidson was recently . told he faced no further action. Former . BBC producers Wilfred De’Ath and Ted Beston and DJ Mike Osman were also . arrested and later told they would not be charged. Radio One DJ Dave . Lee Travis was also cleared of sexual assault, although he now faces a . new trial on three counts. GUILTY . Max Clifford: The public relations expert was arrested on December 6, 2012. Following . a trial, he was found guilty last month of eight counts of indecent . assault stemming from attacks on teenagers dating back more than 40 . years. He was jailed for eight years last week. NO FURTHER ACTION . Wilfred De’ath: . The former BBC producer was arrested on November 11, 2012 on suspicion . of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but was released without . charge after a woman withdrew a complaint against him. The . 76-year-old has blasted police for being ‘overzealous’, pursuing . ‘spurious’ claims, and failing ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign . of terror while he was still alive. Jim Davidson: . The comedian was arrested on January 2, last year on suspicion of . sexual offences, but the 60-year-old Big Brother winner was later told . he would not face further action. Mike Osman: . The 54-year-old radio DJ was arrested in January last year on . suspicion of sex offences. But he was told he will not face any charges last . August. Ted Beston: The former BBC radio producer was arrested on December 19, 2012. In May last year it was announced that the 77-year-old would not face any further action. Jimmy Tarbuck: The 74-year-old comedian was arrested in April last year over allegations of child sex abuse in the 1970s, but released without charge two months ago . David Smith: . The former driver who worked for the BBC was found dead at his home on . the first day of his trial in October last year. The 67-year-old was . arrested in December 2012 and charged in April last year with abusing a . 12-year-old boy in 1984. ONGOING . Dave Lee Travis: The former Radio 1 star – dubbed the 'Hairy Cornflake' – was acquitted on . 12 of 14 sex assault . charges made against him. He will be retried over two allegations on . which a jury failed to agree verdicts. And last month he pleaded not . guilty to a fresh charge of indecently assaulting a woman. Gary Glitter: .

"By . Chris Greenwood . 'Real problem': Chief Constable Alex Marshall, the head of the College of Policing, says half of front-line policing is spent dealing with online crime . Online abuse is behind the majority of complaints to police about anti-social behaviour and harassment, a top officer has warned. Alex Marshall said comments on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are the basis for ‘at least half’ of calls about nuisance crimes. The chief constable, who leads the College of Policing, said low-level crime has moved online along with shopping and banking. He also signalled fears that petty insults and threats now take up a disproportionate amount of police time – but said that many officers still struggle to identify when it breaks the law. ‘Police officers can’t deal with every bit of nonsense or disagreement that occurs on social media and there is a line that needs to be drawn,’ he said. ‘If someone is genuinely threatened or at risk, that’s an issue we need to take on.‘The challenge for officers is to establish what is a criminal act and what is not.’ The College of Policing is currently conducting research into exactly how much crime begins online, with some forces voluntarily ‘flagging’ incidents in their databases to help gather evidence. About 6,000 officers are also undergoing training through the college in how to deal with online offences. Mr Marshall added: ‘Officers dealing with less serious crimes and anti-social behaviour might deal with a dozen calls in a typical day –  and they tell us that at least half of reports of this type, whether around abuse or threats of assault, may be related to social media. ‘We need to ensure that officers have the right skills and training to make these judgments so that we can direct resources appropriately and protect those who genuinely need our help.’ Senior officers have raised concerns about a surge in those who expect police to settle trivial online spats. Targeted: Caroline Criado-Perez was bombarded with rape and death threats by Isabella Sorley, 23, and John Nimmo, 25, after leading a campaign to have a woman's face on the new £10 note . They compare many of the comments to people simply ‘shouting at each other in the street’ – and say they have even been contacted by some complaining that they have been ‘unfriended’ by someone on Facebook. Yet at the same time, police are determined to crack down on serious offences, including stalking and threats of rape  or other attacks. Last year the Director of Public Prosecutions issued guidelines saying those who post offensive messages online must cross a ‘high threshold’ before being brought to court. Messages may also be a crime if they are ‘obscene, grossly offensive or false’. The stronger measures to deal with online harassment follow a series of high-profile cases involving abuse on Twitter. They include the jailing of Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo in January for sending death threats to feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who described the experience as ‘terrifying and scarring’. Future: Mr Marshall added that, at some point, every investigation conducted by police will have some online element to it . With online abuse becoming an increasingly significant part of day-to-day policing, the law has also developed in order to punish those who target victims over the internet. The measures have led to several prosecutions and has even seen some trolls jailed. According to the Department for Public Prosecutions, the criteria for an insult to be treated as offence including: .","Around 6,000 officers are being specially-trained to deal with cyber crime .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Digging is expected to start soon in an attempt to solve the mystery of Madeleine McCann’s disappearance. Search teams will scour sites across Praia da Luz, the Portuguese resort from which she vanished seven years ago at the age of four. Her parents Kate and Gerry, who have never given up hope that she could be alive, have been briefed by Scotland Yard on the planned operation. Resort: British police are said to be planning to dig three sites near the Ocean Club holiday apartments in the resort of Praia da Luz in Portugal, from where Madeleine McCann, then three, went missing in May 2007 . Madeleine, who would be ten on 12 May, was three when she vanished from her holiday flat on 3 May 2007 . Map: British police are expected to excavate two sites near the Ocean Club and one near Praia Da Luz beach . Detectives say the searches are the . logical next step in their multi-million pound inquiry and may coincide . with arrests. They are waiting for permission from the Portuguese . authorities before going ahead. Forensic officers will use ground-penetrating radar to examine sites where earth has been disturbed over the past decade. They will then move in with mechanical diggers and other earth-moving equipment. Finger-tip searches will also be used. A source close the McCanns said it will be a ‘heart-breaking and hugely emotional time’ for the family. ‘Police have assured Kate and Gerry that it does not mean they are specifically searching for her body,’ he said. Detectives are also said to be preparing to dig up a site on a beach near the Ocean Club apartments . Madeleine's parents Gerry, 45, and Kate McCann, 46, attended an open-air prayer service on Saturday . ‘They . are doing searches as much as to rule scenarios out as much as rule . them in. They will be concentrating on several different places at . different phases. ‘Certain . areas should have been searched properly way back by the Portuguese . authorities but were not.’ The searches are not being conducted as the . result of any new information. They are a sensitive issue for the . Portuguese because any digging would suggest local police have done too . little. It is understood . that the McCanns will not travel to Portugal but will be kept abreast of . any developments at home. The high-profile dig is the latest stage of . the Met’s sweeping cold case review of a notorious abduction. A team of detectives have been undertaking a painstaking search through every document collected during the huge inquiry. They . have also made a series of appeals on the BBC’s Crimewatch which has . led to new information coming to light. Police are expected to dig up . two areas of land near the Ocean Club’s apartment 5a, where Madeleine . vanished on May 3, 2007. They will also examine the beach. Fresh . aerial photographs are likely to be taken of the sites to assess the . geography and geology. Officers on foot will examine the most likely . locations, looking for any changes in vegetation, disturbances among . rocks, unusual depressions or excess soil. Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed . Hi-tech . tools can detect changes in magnetic fields in the ground caused by . disturbed earth and changes to resistance in wet soil caused by a body. Ground . penetrating radar and similar equipment was used during a search at the . Haut de la Garenne former children’s home in Jersey several years ago. On . that occasion, police also employed specialist sniffer dogs and . archaeologists, as well as pathologists to look for bodies. Last month, . police announced they were about to begin ‘operational activity’ on the . ground in Portugal, raising hopes that arrests could be imminent. Any formal interviews will be conducted by Portuguese police with Met officers sitting in. Officers . are trying to identify a serial sex attacker who may have struck at . least 18 times in Algarve resorts from 2004 to 2010. Several British girls, including one as young as ten, were assaulted as they slept in their beds. Last . Saturday was the anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance and prayers . were said for her at her village church in Rothley, Leicestershire . Mr .

"By . Chris Greenwood . PM's policy fixer: Whitehall adviser Patrick Rock was detained on child porn charges in February, but the National Crime Agency has never admitted it . Britain's crime agency last night refused to discuss the arrest of a senior No.10 aide three months ago – in case it breaches his human rights. Whitehall adviser Patrick Rock was detained on child porn charges in February, but the National Crime Agency has never admitted it. Yesterday, director general Keith Bristow suggested the information blackout was to protect Rock’s ‘right to life’. Speaking for the first time about the controversy, the former Warwickshire chief constable said he feared such publicity could drive suspects to suicide. And he suggested reporting that someone had been arrested could deprive them of their ‘right to a fair trial’. His comments, which will add to growing fears over secret arrests, provoked outrage among child abuse campaigners. Mr Bristow also said he wanted his staff to be known as crime fighters, not police officers, adding: ‘We are not the police, we are a different type of agency. We have the powers of constables but we are different. We are pleased to be described as crime fighters.’ Described as David Cameron’s policy fixer, Rock, 62, was a key member of the Prime Minister’s inner circle at Downing Street, and had been involved in drawing up Government policy on internet porn filters. He was arrested at his London home on February 13 on suspicion of hoarding child abuse images. Officers from the NCA – known as Britain’s FBI – were called in by No.10 to search his office. Revealed: The senior aide's arrest on suspicion of hoarding child abuse images was revealed by the Daily Mail . The inquiry was revealed by the Daily Mail a fortnight later after the move was confirmed by senior Whitehall figures. The NCA, which says it aims to be open and transparent, has never commented on the inquiry. Yesterday, Mr Bristow suggested this was because the rights of suspects override the need for openness. Director general: Yesterday, Keith Bristow suggested the information blackout was to protect Rock's 'right to life' Asked about the case, he said: ‘It is difficult for us to talk about investigations where we have neither confirmed nor denied investigating anything. We have obligations around right to life and the right to a fair trial. These are obligations we have to balance.’ He added: ‘I believe our interpretation of what is expected of us is right.’ In six months, the NCA has arrested more than 600 people and charged about half, of whom only a handful have been named voluntarily. Its refusal to confirm it had made an arrest in the Rock case contrasts with the policy of every other police force, which always confirm arrests. Leaders at the College of Policing insist it is in the public interest to do so. It is understood that NCA policy was shaped by the Leveson Inquiry, which included proposals to rein in the Press. It highlights concerns that the inquiry into Press standards is letting police and other officials withhold information from the public. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said he was astonished by the secrecy, adding: ‘Abuse persists because it is constantly covered up. ‘There are too many abusers and their apologists in positions of power. Too many with much to lose, and thanks to the public, the media and survivors who have spoken out we finally have them on the run.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Whitehall adviser Patrick Rock detained on child porn charges in February .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Families of the Omagh bombing victims said yesterday that human rights laws favour 'killer gangs'. They spoke out after two Real IRA terrorists won the latest round of their European court fight to escape paying damages. Michael McKevitt and Liam Campbell were ordered to pay a share of £1.6million in aggravated damages after a landmark civil action found them liable for the 1998 atrocity. A Royal Ulster Constabulary officer looking at the damage caused by a bomb explosion in Market Street, Omagh . But their lawyers have persuaded officials at the European Court of Human Rights to put their case to have the order overturned before judges. It was revealed yesterday that the Government must now formally respond to their case after they passed an important filtering stage designed to weed out invalid cases. Families of those murdered when the car bomb exploded in the Northern Irish market town said they were outraged by the decision. Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Aiden was killed in the blast, said the development was a 'psychological blow' and called for the law to be urgently reformed. 'There seems to be no effective law for giving rights to victims,' he said. 'The human rights laws to me would need to be looked at again. 'It has always favoured the killer gangs and organisations and never the victims. It's always weighted on the side of the perpetrator and this news is extremely disappointing.' Mr Gallagher told a Sunday newspaper: 'We are still working under human rights law formed many years ago to deal with the Nazis in Germany post-Second World War and what seems to be happening since the 1970s is terrorism, is the new Nazism, and there has been no effective human rights legislation focused on the victims.' The decision of terrorists to turn to controversial human rights legislation again highlights Europe's influence over the British legal system. They are following in the footsteps of many foreign criminals who have attempted to use the law to escape deportation. The Omagh bombing, in which 29 people and unborn twins died and hundreds more were injured, was the worst single terrorist attack of the Troubles. The Real IRA admitted responsibility, but no one was ever successfully prosecuted in the criminal courts. Royal Ulster Constabulary police officers and firefighters inspect the damage caused by a bomb explosion . However, after a fighting fund was launched by the Daily Mail, grieving families brought an unprecedented civil action and won their first victory at the High Court in Belfast in 2009. McKevitt, Campbell and fellow Republicans Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly, were ordered to pay damages but embarked on a lengthy appeal process. In January last year, it emerged that McKevitt, 64, and Campbell, 52, had taken their case to the Strasbourg court in a final attempt to escape paying up. McKevitt is serving a 20-year jail sentence imposed in 2003 by a court in Dublin for IRA membership and directing terrorism. Campbell, a fellow dissident Republican, was jailed for eight years by the same court in 2004 for IRA membership. Their lawyers claim their rights were breached under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to a fair trial – which has been incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act. The argument focuses on the decision to allow hearsay evidence from FBI agent David Rupert, who infiltrated dissident Republican terrorist groups. Earlier this month Daly, 43, appeared at Dungannon Magistrates' Court charged with 29 counts of murder over Omagh. Stanley McComb, whose wife Ann died in the blast, said of McKevitt and Campbell's move: 'Those b******* will go to any length and any extreme. It's all just a cynical exercise for them. 'These guys are just terrorists, murderers and yet they can get all the support they need to get this into a European court. What is wrong with the judicial system that is allowing this to happen? This is all a moneymaking exercise for the legal profession too.'","Two Real IRA terrorists won latest fight to escape paying damages .

"By . Chris Greenwood . The sinister figure caught on camera as he prowls around inside the multi-million pound home at night would terrify anyone. This is the prolific burglar who has left Boris Becker’s wife living in fear after twice trying to break into the couple’s Wimbledon mansion. Lilly Becker said she leaves lights on all the time and her home is ‘almost a fort’ after the thief was filmed on CCTV outside. She has even considered moving. Scroll down for video . Caught! A prolific burglar, who has targetted homes in Wimbledon Village since 2006, is caught on CCTV while raiding the kitchen of a house in Wimbledon, London . Boris Becker pictured with his wife Lilly. Their home in Wimbledon Common has been targetted by a prolific burglar who raids multi-million pound houses in Wimbledon, south west London. His wife said she feels scared in their home . ‘Our freedom has been taken away,’ said the Dutch model, 37, who has a young son with her 46-year-old husband. ‘I would do anything to protect my family. But I am a skinny little woman, there’s not a lot I can do.’ These images are from some of the homes the ‘meticulous’ cat burglar has targeted in wealthy Wimbledon Village, south-west London. The Beckers are among up to 150 of his victims – including City workers, celebrities and sports stars – over the past seven years. The intruder often wears a tracksuit, gloves and a black fishing hat, although his dark clothing shows up light on the infra-red images. In the main picture the man has a torch in his mouth and is holding what might be a lock-picking device as he searches a home near Wimbledon Common on March 29 last year. He escaped with a large quantity of cash and jewellery. Another CCTV image released by police captures the moment the burglar discovers a hidden camera while calmly wandering around a victim’s kitchen. The burglar, who wears a trademark black fishing hat and black clothing, bags cash and jewellery from the homes by stashing it in his pockets. Police believe he has raided up to 150 homes . The man has had to flee from properties at least three times after being interrupted by homeowners - but has still never been caught . Footage shows him holding his hand over his mouth. Police believe he may be making a voice recording of home security details and other features in preparation for breaking in again. In some cases he has cut CCTV cables and disabled alarm systems and is known to steal little on his first visit, leaving some  victims unaware and vulnerable to a future break-in. On one occasion he was spotted arriving in a dark Vauxhall hatchback, climbing over a fence and cutting the cables to CCTV cameras before trying to force back doors. Detectives are desperate to catch the criminal who is believed to spend days plotting his crimes so that he does not leave a trace. Boris Becker, who is now a known sports pundit, in his tennis-playing days . He was caught trying to get  into the Beckers’ home last  October. The alarm was set off and he fled, but officers have discovered that he tried to get in again on another occasion. Mrs Becker, whose husband won the Wimbledon men’s singles title three times in the 1980s, said she cannot believe the burglar’s reign of terror has lasted so long. She added: ‘Not only do I have to switch on alarms, I have to leave lights on in the house. ‘I can’t enjoy the living room because it’s connected to the  garden where he has jumped over a few times . ‘He can’t make this his profession, he cannot just get away with this and take people’s stuff. ‘We have even talked about  moving and really creating almost a fort, making it so safe that I feel safe, and it shouldn’t be like this.’ Detective Inspector Dan O’Sulllivan of Wimbledon CID said: ‘We are asking for the public’s help so that we can bring this man to justice. He clearly spends a significant amount of time away from home in the early hours, something which cannot go unnoticed by his family and friends.’ Anyone with information is asked to contact Merton Police on 020 8649 3159 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Burglar targetted Wimbledon Common home of tennis legend Boris Becker .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Two fraudsters who stole more than £1million from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in a taxi expenses scam have been told they need only pay back £300,000. Lisa Burrows, 41, and Tahir Mahmood, 50, worked for the state prosecutor in the West Midlands, and stole money from their employer by billing fake taxi journeys for court witnesses to their own bank accounts. They spent the money paying down a huge chunk of the mortgage on a house, while splurging on designer clothes and upmarket hotels in Dubai. Fraudsters: Lisa Burrow, left, and Tahir Mahmood, right, set up a fake taxi . Both of pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position in Birmingham Crown Court last March and given six year prison sentences for taking a total of £1,147,101. It was discovered the swindlers were still sitting on £600,000 of taxpayers' money on their first day in prison. Shortly after they were imprisoned it emerged that the two were still holding around £600,000 of the haul - but a court hearing designed to recover the money for the public purse offered them a more lenient repayment. Burrows, a former finance manager at the CPS, was ordered to repay £73,213 by January 1 or have her sentence lengthened by 18 months. Mahmood, a junior member of staff in Burrows' office who was also her lover, was told to return £233,991 by January or have his sentenced extended by two years. During the fraud - which continued for five years - he had operated the bank account, withdrawing money which had been fraudulently sent to bogus company B&M Taxis. The company - named after Burrows and Mahmood themselves - supposedly ferried witnesses to and from court cases, but in fact the journeys were invented and the cash spent on high living. Jailed: Burrows and Mahmood were given six-year jail sentences as Birmingham Crown Court, pictured . Brett Wilson, defending, said both of his clients would have to sell properties to pay back the cash during the hearing at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday. He added: 'For Mr Mahmood, while there is some cash that can be used and some from a sale of a property, it does leave him a balance to find from either borrowing or the sale of another property.' Burrows, of Oldbury, and Mahmood, of Hodge Hill, accused each other of launching the scam after they met in 2008. When they were sentenced originally, Judge Davis QC condemned the pair for the serious breach of public trust, saying they were driven by 'pure greed'. He said: 'That money went on high living – expensive holidays in Dubai and New York, designer clothing, jewellery... It is difficult to envisage a more serious fraud of its type that the one you committed.'","Lisa Burrows, 41, and Tahir Mahmood, 50, carried out five-year scam .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Radical: A British militant in Syria on a YouTube video - one of a growing number going to fight . Hundreds more British jihadists have now travelled to Syria, the UK’s police counter-terrorism chief admitted yesterday. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said the authorities are powerless to stop young Muslims heading to the war-torn state. The Scotland Yard chief said the battle against the Assad regime acts like a ‘magnet’ – and fighters now number in the ‘mid’ rather than ‘low’ hundreds. There is speculation the figure could be as high as 700 as the authorities admit they are struggling to monitor those who are in the Middle East. Among those in Syria are children as young as 16, and even a small number of women who have gone to marry and care for militants. The warning came as a national campaign to urge women to stop their loved ones going to Syria was criticised as fundamentally flawed. The mothers, wives and sisters of potential jihadists were asked to contact the police so that officers can intervene. But Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee, said that the police are not a counselling service. He said: ‘It is unlikely that family members will want to report suspicions about their own children to the authorities. All the evidence indicates that the families themselves are last to know. ‘The police are not the Samaritans, they are the first step in the criminal enforcement process.’ Ministers are increasingly concerned at the growing numbers of Britons travelling to Syria to fight alongside militants. Among the armed groups are terrorists fighting under the flag of Al Qaeda who want to bring sharia law to the broken state. The fear is that young men will be radicalised while fighting on the front line, learning about weapons and bomb-making. If they survive, they could return to Britain with violent ideological ideas and launch domestic terrorist attacks. Scroll down for video . Mothers, wives and sisters of potential jihadists have been asked to contact the police who will intervene . Scotland Yard is considering whether to release graphic images of those injured in the fighting in a bid to discourage potential jihadists. Senior officers are concerned that young men are being groomed by romanticised propaganda on social networks, which promises ‘five star jihad’. DAC Ball admitted that police could not physically stop anyone travelling to Syria, even if relatives reported them. She said police and the security services face huge challenges as they try to monitor what is taking place in Syria and along its chaotic border with Turkey. But, she added, anyone identified on their return as having joined the conflict – even for the Free Syrian Army – faces arrest under anti-terrorism laws. Scotland Yard warned the Assad regime is increasingly becoming a 'magnet' for young extremists . More than 40 people have been arrested for crimes linked to Syria in the first three months of this year, compared to 25 in the whole of 2013. Earlier this month prospective Brighton University student Abdullah Deghayes, 18, was killed in a gunfight in Kassab in Latakia. His two brothers, Jaffar, 16, and Amer, 20, remain in Syria. Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government is ‘very concerned’ about the threat posed by jihadists returning from Syria, adding: ‘We are trying to prevent people from travelling there. ‘If you know someone who is in danger of being radicalised, with radical views, and is thinking of travelling to Syria, then the best thing to do is to talk to the police, talk to the authorities so that we can help you.’","Scotland Yard said Assad regime is 'magnet' for young extremists .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Neil Sears . A wealthy entrepreneur and member of one of Britain’s best known families was stabbed to death by a screaming attacker armed with a pair of scissors. James Fiennes – second cousin of Arctic explorer Sir Ranulph – was having a drink in an upmarket tapas restaurant when the man went ‘out of his mind’ and repeatedly plunged the blades into his body. As the assailant was tackled by a former police officer, the 49-year-old victim collapsed to the floor. He underwent emergency surgery in hospital but died five hours later. A man who was stabbed to death at an upmarket tapas restaurant was the relative of actor Ralph Fiennes (right) and explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes (left), it emerged today . Last night, Sir Ranulph was said to be . in deep shock as he flew back from the US.

Marlborough . College-educated Mr Fiennes, whose family live near Sherborne in . Dorset, was a regular customer and stayed at a nearby flat while working . in London. The businessman . was drinking with colleagues at about 9pm when he was confronted by a . man who arrived at the restaurant on a bicycle. Jackson Fiorini, who has . managed the bar for 14 years and known Mr Fiennes for five, said: ‘The . attacker came in and just stabbed him, he didn’t even buy a drink. ‘James hadn’t even had time to finish his beer, it was completely out of the blue. ‘James . went to the loo, he came back and this guy attacked him. He went out of . his mind. My niece heard what was happening and ran to tell him to . stop. The guy was screaming like an animal.’ Mr . Fiorini said that as his niece dialled 999, another customer – who once . served as a police officer – stepped in and persuaded the attacker to . drop the scissors, before immobilising him. He . said the assailant was yelling ‘kill me before the police come’, . adding: ‘He was trying to get at James even as we were holding him down. It took about five people to hold him until the police came.’ The . son of the former Dean of Lincoln, Mr Fiennes owned several businesses . including an IT consultancy and a company selling imported French soap.

"By . Harriet Arkell . A retired Coutts banker laundered £655,000 of the proceeds from a multi-million pound fraud run by his son, a court heard. Roger Noad is accused of allowing his son Matthew, 29, to funnel £655,000 through his bank accounts over six years. Noad worked for Queen's bank Coutts for 30 years. Jurors at the Old Bailey in London were told that Matthew Noad was 23 and living at home with his parents in Kent when he launched a cold-calling investment scam with Clive Griston, 52. Roger Noad, 60, and his wife Linda, 58, of Sevenoaks, are accused of charges relating to their son's fraud . The scam, which involved the men using glossy brochures to persuade elderly victims to buy land on the basis that they would get high returns if if was developed, earned them vast amounts, the court heard. Matthew Noad made around £2.1million from it, £655,000 of which he transferred to his parents in a series of payments to their Coutts account, jurors heard. The court was told how Roger Noad, 60, and his wife Linda, 58, went on an expensive holiday to Dubai with their son, and witnessed his extravagant spending on wines, a new Mercedes and jewellery worth £18,000. Prosecutor Mark Fenhalls said Noad Sr had introduced his son to Griston and must have suspected where the money was coming from. 'Roger Noad worked for Coutts bank for 30 years,' the prosecutor told jurors. 'You may consider a man who works for a bank must be better informed and more likely to ask questions, particularly when the sums are spectacularly eye-watering.' 'You will have to consider the lifestyle he was enjoying while living with his parents.' Mr Fenhalls said that when the Noads went to Dubai, they were 'no doubt enjoying with Matthew the fruits of the fraud.' Land scam: Matthew Noad, 29, left, and Clive Griston, 52, right, have already admitted two counts of fraud . Defendant: Kerry Golesworthy, 38, of Orpington, denies two charges relating to fraud . Griston laundered a total of £996,000 through the account of his partner Kerry Golesworthy, 48, while he was facing bankruptcy, it is claimed. The money was used to put a deposit on a £790,000 home in Orpington and to buy a new £109,000 Bentley, £40,000 of furniture and a £10,000 pearl necklace, jurors were told. Mr Fenhalls said: 'They can only have been seeking to buy this house because they knew there was going to be a lot of money coming in to finance it. 'Given there was a petition for his bankruptcy, it is hardly surprising they chose to put it into their home.' The prosecutor said the necklace was probably a Christmas present for Golesworthy, who earned less than £9,000 a year through bookkeeping. He added: 'She is plainly a competent woman with a thoroughly respectable and experienced career. 'Her earnings are not consistent with the colossal sums that are passing through various banks she is controlling.' Jurors were told Griston, of Orpington, Kent, and Matthew Noad, of Keston, Kent, have already admitted running the land investment scam and a second fraud involving worthless carbon credits, and have been sentenced. Golesworthy, of Orpington, and Linda and Roger Noad, both of Sevenoaks, Kent, all deny entering into an arrangement facilitating the use of criminal property relating to the land fraud. Roger Noad and Golesworthy also both deny a charge of converting criminal property.. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An NHS worker stole £650,000 from a cancer hospital’s drugs fund and blew it on her wedding and designer handbags. Stacey Tipler, 32, siphoned off the cash while working in the accounts department of the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, transferring it into accounts controlled by a gang recruited by her fiancé, Scott Chaplin, 33. The funds were then quickly withdrawn and split, with Tipler using her share to go shopping for Gucci handbags and pay for her nuptials, which were planned for May 2013.

But she was arrested a year before her big day, after suspicious staff at suppliers Alliance Healthcare notified the NHS that the company had received two remittance slips with no accompanying payment. Investigators have only been able to claw back around half of the stolen cash. Tipler and Chaplin, of Carshalton, Surrey, face jail after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud after a two-week trial. They will be sentenced at a later date. Chaplin was also found guilty of money laundering by the jury. Tipler sobbed as Judge Anthony Leonard QC warned her: ‘I appreciate there are children involved in this case but you must also appreciate what the likely sentence will be.’ Co-defendants Aiden Butcher, 38, Steven Rico, 22 and Danielle Flynn, 35, were cleared of money laundering. Clinton Woolery, 35, Thomas Quinlan, 26, William Flynn, 37, Russell Baker, 32, Roy Harriott, 26, and Adrian Horan, 42, had earlier admitted money laundering.

"By . Joel Christie . It's about the size of a simple two-bedroom apartment, only without any windows, refrigeration, plants or, most importantly, the ability to venture outside without a space suit. And six researchers who have been living in a Mars simulation for the last four months in Hawaii have been able to finally leave the solar-powered dome and return to the real world. The research mission on the Mauna Loa volcano ended 120 days of the Red Plant exploration as part of the second Hawaii Space Exploration Analog & Simulation mission, known as HI-SEAS, according to ABC News. The 1,000-square-foot mock planet station features a kitchen, dining room, bathroom, lab and exercise space, as well as six small bedrooms. Free at last: Members of a mock Mars mission celebrate their return to the real world on Saturday after four months inside this pod in Hawaii . Simulation: The landscape of the Muana Loa volcano in Hawaii are similar - if only physically - to the conditions of Mars . The 1,000-square-foot solar-powered dome was created as a test to see how well astronauts could live on Mars for an extended amount of time . The pod features a research lab, dining room, kitchen, exercise space and single bedrooms . 'I haven't seen a tree, smelled the train, heard a bird, or felt wind on my skin in four months,' Expedition leader Casey Stedman posted on his Instagram account. Perhaps what the team were most excited about however was real food. They have been living off dehydrated meals for the entire mission. 'It's really great to taste fresh fruit and vegetables again,' Stedman told ABC News. 'The main purpose of the project is to learn about the problems that might occur to crew members if they went to Mars' Kimberly Binsted, principal investigator of the project, told ABC News. Another major part of the process was learning to handle conflicts, depression and anxiety in a confined space, as astronauts would have to constantly do. 'It's not like if you have a problem with someone, you can go out for a run in a park on Mars,' Binsted said. 'You have to get along with each other in a very small space.' HI-SEAS 2 was run by the University of Hawaii at Manoa and funded by NASA's Human Research Program . Man on Mars: The team would stage mock space walks as part of the mission . Surprisingly, Stedman said everyone got along fairly well. 'There weren't really altercations among the crew,' Stedman said. 'But even in a family vacation, you disagree with someone over something.' The astronauts would only venture outside in mock space suits and would treat the expedition as if they were actually on Mars. HI-SEAS is a test to see what life would be like on Mars for astronauts staying on the planet for an extended period of time. The team entered the dome on March 28. Preparation: This picture shows crews working to construct the dome last year . HI-SEAS 2 is run by the University of Hawaii at Manoa and funded by NASA's Human Research Program. The first mission finished up after a 118-day stint in August last year. Mars is the main long-term goal of NASA's human spaceflight program, according to NBC. The agency aims to get astronauts to the vicinity of the Red Planet by the mid-2030s.","Team entered the 1,000-square-foot solar-powered dome on Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii on March 28 .

Host: James Taylor denied responsibility for his guests at the enormous 'Project P' party on Saturday . While Taylor spoke to a camera crew, this guest was filmed passed out on the floor of his house . Crowd: A reported 2,000 guests showed up at Taylor's party in Hinton Township on Saturday . Dangerous: Seven people were hospitalized and an alleged rape took place at the bash. A drunk driver later reportedly left the party and crashed into a house . WOOD reported the 19-year-old female attendee at the party was allegedly gang-raped. Speaking to Fox 17 on Monday, Taylor said of first responders' arrival 'I'm glad they went. People could have been laying dead this morning. I'm glad the police were here. And the ambulances.' 'I didn't force anything down anybody's throat. I didn't make anybody stay here till 7am or 11 or whatever it is when everybody finally left.

"By . Hugo Daniel In Upland, California . and Zoe Szathmary . Diane Stretton, the ex-nanny who 'squatted' inside a California family's home after being hired off of Craigslist, is now out. CBSLosAngeles reported Wednesday that Stretton, 64, is no longer living inside the Bracamonte family's Upland residence. Some of her belongings are still there, the station said. Marcella . Bracamonte, 31, told MailOnline in a June interview when Stretton moved in things began well and she and . Ralph, 35, baked a cake for their baby daughter’s birthday with her . help. The photo of the nanny grinning with the freshly baked cake has now been beamed around the world. Marcella . said: 'She moved in the week of March 4 and March 8 was my baby’s . birthday, so that picture was taken March 7, we all made a cake . together. It was fun, I thought how fun, we could do this again every . year, I planned on her staying a long time, and she could have stayed a . long time she just had to help me.' The nanny also settled in quickly and would use the family’s swimming pool. Marcella . said: 'She would get in her bathing suit, come out have a beer with us, . barbecue, music. She liked it. She would sit in the layout chairs and . sunbathe she would go in the inflatable and lie in the pool.' However . the first signs of trouble came three weeks in when she began to refuse . to do housework or watch the children if Marcella - who had wanted to . set up her own business at home - wanted to go out for meetings. Scroll down for video . Good riddance: Diane Stretton, 64, has left the home of her former employers - months after she stopped working for them . Had enough: Mother-of-three Marcella Bracamonte said she chose to speak out about what happened to her family to stop Diane Stretton doing it to anyone else . Stretton would use the pool at the family's home in Upland, California, and 'settled in quickly' On the move: Stretton used to live out of her silver Pontiac Grand Am (pictured) for days at a time . She said:  'After three weeks she would be like leaning on things and acting out of breath [while cleaning the floor]. My house is not very dirty… there was not a lot of work you had to do. 'All of a sudden it was like '‘It’s so hot in here'', ''You need to put the air on'’. 'I would make her breakfast, lunch and dinner she never came and helped me prepare those meals, but she was there to eat it and this was from day one. 'I asked her to clean her bathroom, she did it but then she threw a fit, she stomped out of the bathroom, went to her room, slammed the door and stayed in there the whole day and never came out….. She said it was too hard. She was like a teenager, it was like taking care of another child. It was like she felt she was entitled to us taking care of her.' Stretton didn’t mention her health problems when she took the job. Stumped: Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte with their three children, ages, 11, 4 and one . Marcella said: 'She never told me she had COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) when I hired her, she told me nothing, she said she was perfectly happy. I said ‘'is there anything you can tell me that might prevent you performing this job?'’ and she said no.' On Mother’s Day Ralph even cooked the nanny a special meal. Marcella said: 'He made her a steak dinner, he served her and he said ‘'happy Mother’s Day, and she said thank you. Yeah it makes me angry, because we treated her like family we loved her.' Stretton has even filed paperwork to try and force the Bracamontes OUT of their own home, pictured here . Marcella told MailOnline in June: 'Ralphy says ‘Mummy I don’t love Diane anymore, I was going to marry her, but not anymore, she hurts my heart’. 'He’s four, and he loved her, he loved her like grandma, he would give her hugs. They were real close and then all of a sudden she didn’t want nothing to do with them anymore.' Marcella admitted she made a mistake hiring Stretton but believed publicizing it as she has will stop the nanny from doing it to anyone else. She said: 'I buy a lot of things from Craigslist, I’ve never met a psycho in my life except for her. 'I called three references… I can’t get blamed for her not being honest with me. She seemed nice. 'I made a mistake as a mom, I’m not going to be the first one who’s made a mistake. 'I’m just the first mom to put it on public television and in the media, I own up to it because this can happen to anyone, not just a nanny, but anyone you have in your house. It’s not about a nanny, it has everything to do about the law, that’s my point.' Asked what her message is to Stretton, a defiant Marcella said:  'If I could say one thing to her right now, it would be ‘'You can never do this again and get away with it, you will go the rest of your life now being labeled and I did this for everybody you victimized because it’s not right. You’re never going to do this again''.' Careful: Mrs Bracamonte, pictured with her children, said she carried out background checks on the woman . While showing MailOnline the letter Stretton gave her when she first tried to get rid of her, Marcella said: 'She wrote me a letter, it’s a letter of extortion I feel, telling me I can be at my house at this time and this time, and that I need to feed her healthy food or give her $200, she wrote it to get me really upset, to get me furious and she did get me furious, but I didn’t respond to her. 'She’s playing games, she knows I have a very short temper and she’s trying to wind me up, she’s not going to do it because I know her game, I’m not going to get wound up. 'She’s a liar in the upmost form. It’s terrible there’s people like that. I think she’s a scorpion, it’s just in her blood.' Marcella did feel some pity for the nanny, adding: 'I do feel sorry for her, but she’s not a very nice person. I wonder where it went wrong for her? 'She told me her sister’s swindled her too. She made me feel sorry for her. 'I would love to talk to her sisters, because she’s put her sisters through hell, I almost want to tell them this one’s for them.' Asked if she will ever get a nanny again after this, Marcella said: 'No never. First of all, I would not want anyone to come in my house to live with me… I’m not even going to have a houseguest. I’ve been put off for life.' 'Obviously there needs to be a law changed, we are going to go through a procedure and America is watching how difficult it can be to get someone out of your house. And that’s a good thing [as it might get the law changed].'","Diane Stretton, 64, stayed put inside the home of Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte in Upland, California .

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia was coming together on Thursday to express 'sorrow and solidarity' for the victims and their loved ones. 'You have not been abandoned and you never will be,' he said. He said it was a time to rededicate the nation to supporting the bereaved, obtaining justice for the dead and for their families, and to working for a better world. 'The dead of flight MH17 reflect what's best in modern Australia: doctors who worked with refugees, teachers who worked with indigenous people and children with disabilities, volunteers in our armed forces and with local charities, business innovators and pillars of local communities, young people filled with passion for the life before them,' he said. He said hundreds of police and defence personnel were working around the clock to bring home the dead with respect and dignity. 'This is what Australians do in times of trouble - we reach out to people and do what we can to help. 'We try to create order in the midst of chaos and we try to inject decency into the vilest of situations.'

He said those who died on MH17 were the victims of a most 'terrible, violent and unimaginable evil'. 'We mourn 38 of our own who laughed, learned and loved beneath the Southern Cross that today flies at half mast around the nation,'he said. He said some will call today closure, some will call it acceptance, some will call it letting go. 'Whatever it is, it will take a while,' he said. Malaysian High Commissioner Zainal Abidin Ahmad and Dutch ambassador Annemieke Ruigrok also gave readings. Amid the pipe organ and gothic columns, singers Katie Noonan and Abby Dobson provided a modern element to the musical set by singing the Leonardo's Bride song Even When I'm Sleeping.

The Victorian capital was chosen because 16 of the 38 Australians killed were from that state . Religious leaders from different faiths addressed the packed cathedral before Sir Peter spoke of the grief, shock, anger, confusion and loss felt across the globe as a result of the disaster. 'So often words do not and cannot express our true feelings and thoughts during such a time of great loss,' he said. He paid tribute to the West Australian Maslin family, who lost children Mo, Evie and Otis - aged 12, 10 and 8 respectively - who died along with their grandfather Nick Norris in the crash.

People arriving at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne described the service as a sombre and uniting moment. Wayne Kang, an international student studying in Melbourne who lost a loved one in the disaster, met other students to walk into the cathedral as a group. 'It's a sense of respect, I think, and not just for the family that we lost. It's for everyone on the plane,' Mr Kang said. Sydney resident Kerrie Dunn said on her way into the service that it was a meaningful occasion. 'It helps to bring the nation together and the people together."" Mrs Dunn said she did not personally know anyone lost in the downing of the flight 'but I think that it's a global thing. You feel for everybody, and all the relatives that lost somebody on the flight. 'Those people were, I'm sure, eager to get to their homes and families and continue on with their lives, and they have been cut very short.' Mrs Dunn said she also wanted to pay tribute to the workers who had risked their lives to recover the bodies in eastern Ukraine, and to investigate the crash site. Another man, who wanted only to be described only as a mourner, said the downing of flight MH17 was a 'despicable' act.

Text messages that show a bride accidentally inviting a stranger to her wedding then trying to uninvite the guest - only to receive a message in reply that reads 'We still coming' - are fake.

Accounts vary, . but someone uploaded a photo of the Hicks' wedding party posing on the . set of 7262's 'Anthem' along with the fake messages to social media. Wedding . photographer Adam Sparkes told MailOnline it was his idea to have the . couple pose for photographs at Michigan Central Station.

Sparkes said he told the rappers 'We're gonna come dance in that video' - and a man replied 'You should.' 'They were like 'Come on over,' he said. 'We crashed in on them.'

Sparkes said 7262 was 'pretty gracious' for letting him and the Hicks' wedding party join in on the fun. 'I went to EliteDaily and tried to dispel the myth,' he said. 'It was starting to feel like it was a little trope for people on the Internet - for a group of 20-something black guys to crash a wedding - but it rubbed me as being just a little unfair enough.' Sparkes said the text messages were fake and '100 percent speculation.' Asked by MailOnline about the reason for the hoax, Sparkes said he thought 'Someone just thought it would be funny - lulcat mentality.' As for the idea Amy and Ian Hicks would text out wedding invitations, Sparkes said 'It's so far from these guys - they had a Colony Club wedding - they live in DC - they were not texting out invitations. It was black-tie and [was over a year] in the making.' 7262 later released the video for 'Anthem' in early July, featuring the wedding party as dancers.

Trendsetter: Miss Idaho 2014 Sierra Sanderson showed her insulin pump during the Miss Idaho pageant . 'Honestly, it is terrifying walking out on stage in a swimsuit, let alone attached to a medical device,' she wrote. 'My message to everyone, diabetic or not, is that we all have something that doesn't ""measure up"" to the beauty standards set by the media -- and that is okay!'

Above, Mr Prach's destroyed car . Its offensive has pushed . the rebels into the two cities, which they have now . proclaimed capitals of two 'people's republics'. Today, residents . in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine's main industrial hub which has seen the bulk of the fighting, said Ukrainian warplanes had carried out air strikes and shelling . overnight. Massive explosions could be heard in the area during the night, while numerous holes and craters were spotted in the ground in an industrial district near the city centre this morning. 'The . planes were flying low. Then there were two massive explosions and the . glass was blown out of the window. It was terrifying. This is war. There . will never be peace,' a local woman named Nadezhda told Reuters.

Above, a building in Donetsk damaged by shelling last night . Rubble: Children inspect a crater in Donetsk today following alleged overnight arstrikes in the rebel stronghold . But this afternoon, government . military spokesman Lysenko denied Ukrainian planes had carried out air . strikes. 'The Ukrainian military does not bomb the towns of Donetsk and . Luhansk or any other similar populated places,' he said. Many . residents have fled the two cities, but hundreds of thousands of people . are still living in them, increasingly fearful that they will bear the . brunt of a full-blown assault. Meanwhile, Russia . has massed around 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's border and . could use the pretext of a humanitarian mission to invade, NATO said today. With . fighting escalating and rebels losing ground in the weeks since . Malaysian airliner MH17 was shot down over separatist-held territory, Russia . has announced military exercises this week in the border region. It is the starkest warning yet that Moscow could soon mount a . ground assault against its neighbour. 'We're . not going to guess what's on Russia's mind, but we can see what Russia . is doing on the ground - and that is of great concern. Russia has . amassed around 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's eastern border,' NATO spokesman Oana Lungescu said in a statement. Moscow . could use 'the pretext of a humanitarian or peace-keeping mission as an . excuse to send troops into Eastern Ukraine', she added. A NATO . military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the build-up at the border included tanks, infantry, artillery, air . defence systems, logistics troops, special forces, and various aircraft. Since . March, Russian President Vladamir Putin has vowed to use military force to protect . Russian-speaking 'compatriots' across the former Soviet Union. He has also . branded southern and eastern Ukraine 'New Russia', a name the rebels . took up as the banner for their movement. Armed: Carrying rifles, pro-Russian rebels are pictured inspecting damage after a night of shelling in Donetsk . Polish . Prime Minister Donald Tusk today said the threat of a direct . intervention by Russia's military in Ukraine has risen over the last . couple of days. Since . June, Ukrainian troops have gained ground against the rebels, who are . led almost exclusively by Russian citizens and have managed to acquire a range of . tanks, missiles and other heavy weaponry. Kiev . said 18 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed and 54 injured in 25 . separate clashes over the past day in eastern Ukraine. Military . spokesman Andriy Lysenko said troops had been shelled from inside . Russian territory and frontier guards had come under a four-hour mortar . and artillery attack. Ready to fight: A pro-Russian rebel adjusts his weapon in the eastern city today as Kiev's forces move in . Fighting . has intensified since Malaysian flight MH17 crashed on July 17, killing . all 298 people on board. Western countries say it was shot down by . rebels with an advanced anti-aircraft missile supplied by Russia. However, Moscow . denies blame, and the Russians who command the rebels deny they had . such missiles. The United . States and the European Union have sharply tightened the sanctions imposed on Russia since the airliner was brought . down. Today, . Ukrainian media published images they claim shows wreckage from the . downed Malaysian aircraft is being used as part of a roadblock leading . into the breakaway Donetsk region. The . photographs, taken by Ukrainian journalists, purport to show part of . the aircraft's fuselage being used to strengthen a roadblock near the . village of Rassypnoye. Journalist .

"By . Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Fast food giant McDonald's has been slammed by medical professionals for trialling a home delivery service in a Queensland town where one in four children are overweight. Population growth in the Hervey Bay region was the main reason for McDonald’s choosing the location, but the community's growing waistlines was a strong argument not to deliver burgers and fries to resident’s front doorsteps, according to Australian Medical Association (AMA) Queensland president Dr Shaun Rudd. This comes as AMA Queensland launched a campaign last week to highlight the obesity crisis facing regional and rural Queenslanders which revealed two out of three adults, and one in four children, are overweight or obese in Hervey Bay. Hervey Bay residents will be able to order McDonald's to their front doorstep which has incensed medical professionals as the town has an obesity crisis . New health statistics reveal two out of three adults and one in four children are overweight or obese in Hervey Bay . Hervey Bay’s population is also expanding with a growth in the area  - which located about three hours north of Brisbane - of 14, 556 people within a decade from 2001 to 2011. Dr Rudd said it was sad that the fast food chain had chosen an already overweight population to have easier access to junk food. ‘These large corporations have a look where they're going to get the most bang for their buck and they choose places like that,’ Dr Rudd told the ABC. ‘I think unfortunately they'll sell more food and that means there's going to be more burgers and more fries eaten by the population there, and they are already extremely overweight.’ McDonald's Australia corporate communications manager Chris Grant said the company would look at extending the service, which will operate seven days a week adn has a minimum $25 order and a $4.95 delivery fee, once the trial ended. Fraser Coast Mayor Gerard O'Connell said the trial would bring investment and employment opportunities to the area but urged residents to use their common sense. ‘If you don't do things in balance, if you rely on takeaway food being delivered to the door, don't exercise and don't keep a check on your health, that's a recipe for disaster,’ he said. There are already two home delivery trials being tested in Sydney, one is starting in Melboune later this month and home delivery is also earmarked for Karratha in Western Australia. Population growth in the Hervey Bay region was the main reason for the fast food chain to decide to run the trial seven days a week . Hervey Bay's population is expanding with a growth of 14, 556 people within a decade from 2001 to 2011 in the town located about three and a half hours north of Brisbane .","A McDonald's home delivery trial will be run in Hervey Bay .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Two men have been charged with attempted murder after allegedly trying to carve a tattoo from their housemate's arm before setting him on fire, officials have said. Paul Hurst, 33, and Cary Edwards, 35, reportedly savagely beat up 31-year-old Zachary Swanson following an argument at their home in Hebron in Wicomico County, Maryland. They then unsuccessfully tried to forcibly remove a tattoo from his arm, before dousing his arm with a flammable liquid and setting it alight, it is claimed. Suspects: Paul Hurst (left), 33, and Cary Edwards (right), 35, have been charged with attempted murder after allegedly trying to carve a tattoo from 31-year-old Zachary Swanson's arm, before setting him on fire . Mr Swanson was taken to Peninsula Regional Medical Center and was later airlifted to a Baltimore burn center. He remains there in a critical condition with 'extensive' injuries, including severe burns, Wicomico County Sheriff Mike Lewis said in a statement. Mr Lewis said Mr Swanson had been 'savagely beaten and nearly killed by two cohabitants' during the assault in the early hours of Monday morning. He was then reportedly left on the ground without medical treatment for several hours, before being driven to the hospital in Salisbury. Scene: Hurst and Edwards reportedly 'savagely beat and nearly killed' Mr Swanson following an argument at their home in Rockawalkin Road (pictured) in Hebron, Maryland, in the early hours of Monday morning . Investigators . believe those involved in the incident may be affiliated with Juggalos, . a cult fan base of the rap-metal duo Insane Clown Posse. Officials said Mr Swanson's tattoo was consistent with the cult, which is deemed a 'loosely organised gang' by the FBI. The Wicomico Bureau of Investigation is investigating the incident, while detectives are executing a search warrant on the trio's house and the vehicle used to transport Mr Swanson to hospital. Hurst, of Hebron, and Edwards, of Williamsburg, Virginia, were arrested on Monday. They have each been charged with attempted first-degree and second-degree murder, first-degree and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and use of a deadly weapon. Juggalos are fans of the rap-metal duo Insane Clown Posse or another Psychopathic Records hip hop group. They have developed their own slang and characteristics, including drinking and spraying the soft drink Faygo, carrying hatchets, listening to 'horrorcore 'and wearing clown or corpse face paint. Juggalos and the artists they support hold a festival, dubbed 'The Gathering of the Juggalos', every year, which attracts more than 100,000 fans.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This is the moment two thugs were filmed posing with a huge Rambo-style knife - just seconds before stabbing to death an innocent teenager. Kelvin Wilhelm, then 26, had been out of jail for only one month when he and 23-year-old Anthony Ellis began playing with the 15-inch knife during a party at Ellis's mother's home in Manchester. They were videoed terrorising partygoers with the hunting blade while donning stab vests and making 'gang' gestures, before getting into a row with 18-year-old John Muldowney. Scroll down for video . Killers: Kelvin Wilhelm (left), 26, and Anthony Ellis, 23, are filmed posing with a huge Rambo-style knife at Ellis's home in Wythenshawe, Manchester. Just seconds later, they stabbed to death 18-year-old John Muldowne . Jailed: Wilhelm (left) was today sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 20 years after being found guilty of murder at Manchester Crown Court. Ellis (right) was handed a 10-year jail sentence for manslaughter . Wilhelm wrongly accused Mr Muldowney of stealing cannabis from him, ordered him to be strip searched and staged a ten second . countdown in a bid to make him give back the device. When he reached 'three', the thug began . grappling with Mr Muldowney and while Ellis punched the victim, Wilhelm plunged the blade into his chest. Wilhelm later misplaced the phone and police found the damning footage, taken by a female companion, as they examined the scene . at the house in Benchill, Wythenshaw. Today, Wilhelm, now 30, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 20 years after being found guilty of murder in a retrial at Manchester Crown Court. Victim: Mr Muldowney was stabbed in the chest . Ellis, now 27, was handed a 10-year jail sentence after being convicted of manslaughter. The pair were originally jailed for life after being convicted of murder in December 2010. But their convictions were last year overturned by Appeal Court judges who ruled the original jury had not been fully instructed on the issue of'murderous intent'. Both men had denied all offences. At the time of the killing in June 2010, police discovered that Wilhelm had been wanted for recall to prison after failing to comply with the conditions of his release. The thug had been sentenced to 65 months for a knifepoint robbery at a house in January 2008, but was released early in May 2010 after serving only half his sentence. Wilhelm and Ellis had become close friends and the younger man saw himself as a 'big man' and had adopted a 'no one can touch me attitude', the court heard. A girlfriend of Ellis told how he and Wilhelm both 'egged each other on', how 'everybody else seemed to fade away into the background' and how 'it was all about them two'. On the day of the killing, the pair, who were high on cocaine and booze at the time, had invited Mr Muldowney to a party at Ellis's house. At the time, Ellis was feuding with south Manchester gangsters and had thrown a party at his mother's home to protect it from attack. During the evening, Ellis was seen wearing the knife - which had 'teeth marks' on the top of the blade - under the waistband of his trousers. He was then spotted waving the knife around aggressively, saying he was going to kill 'hoodlums' from a gang based in Moss Side, Manchester, the court heard. Later in a bedroom, a female guest got hold to Wilhelm's phone and starting videoing him as he and Ellis drunkenly larked about with the knife. Posing: Wilhelm and Ellis were videoed passing the hunting blade to each other while making 'gang' gestures . Disturbing: A female guest videoed the pair's actions at Ellis's house on the night of the killing in June 2010 . Shortly before 3am, Wilhelm demanded that party guests took their trousers off after accusing them of stealing cannabis from him. While others agreed, Mr Muldowney did not. This led to a struggle between Wilhelm, Ellis and the victim, during which neighbours could hear screams coming from the house. Police and paramedics were called and Mr Muldowney was taken to hospital with a single stab wound to his chest. He was pronounced dead a short time later. Ellis and two others who were still in . the house were arrested. Wilhelm went to a police station the next day . as he was wanted on recall to prison, and was arrested on suspicion of . murder. Larking around: Wilhelm then wrongly accused Mr Muldowney of stealing cannabis, ordered him to be strip searched and staged a ten second countdown. Above, the killers are filmed brandishing the Rambo knife . Sentencing Wilhelm, Judge David Stockdale QC told him: 'You have shown no remorse. The apparent remorse you demonstrated to the jury was a performance, and an unconvincing one at that. 'But you will have to live for the rest of your life with the knowledge you killed a young man who was your friend.' In a statement, Mr Muldowney's mother Jeanette Toner said she was 'finding it difficult to put into words the pain I feel'. She said: 'I love my five children all the same but John held a shine in my heart. He was a smart, clean, fresh faced young man with manners. Case: Wilhelm and Ellis were initially convicted of murder in December 2010, but later successfully overturned the verdict at the Court of Appeal. They were today sentenced at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) 'No other pain has ever compared. No . matter what happens to those who ended John’s short but precious life my . heartache will never end. 'The re-trial has only served to open old wounds. Our suffering is no less, four years down the line.' Detective Chief Inspector Graham Brock said he hoped today's sentenced would help Mr Muldowney's family to 'move on with their lives'. 'This was a gathering that turned rowdy in the most tragic of ways,' he said. 'Wilhelm’s actions were that of a violent man who was firstly threatening people he called his friends with a knife, and then showed he was willing to inflict a fatal stab wound on John. 'Ellis was complicit in the murder as he egged on Wilhelm and did nothing to stop the stabbing. 'Our thoughts remain with John Muldowney’s family who have had to endure a second trial. I hope the sentence today gives them some comfort and that they are able to move on with their lives.'","Kelvin Wilhelm, 26, and Anthony Ellis, 23, were filmed brandishing knife .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Sophie Jane Evans . Prevented from dying with dignity: Brian Williams, 77, suffered 31 electric shocks in two days after doctors failed to switch off a heart defibrillator inside him . A dying father suffered 31 painful electric shocks in two days after doctors failed to switch off a heart defibrillator inside him. Brian Williams, 77, was admitted to Tameside Hospital after he collapsed at home with a terminal brain tumour. After doctors told his seven children he was unlikely to live, they decided to end his treatment. But he was prevented from dying with dignity after doctors failed to turn off an implant fitted years earlier to regulate an abnormal heart rhythm. Defibrillator implants are fitted in people with abnormal heart rhythms and can give the heart electric shocks to restore the patient’s heart beat. They are inserted just under the collar bone and are the size of a matchbox. In this case, it meant that every time Mr Williams was finally slipping away, he suffered an electric shock inside his body as the device tried to restart his heart and bring him back to life. It was only when Mr Williams’ son-in-law held his hand and he was shocked himself that doctors realised their mistake. The pensioner's defibrillator implant was eventually deactivated and he died a few hours later. Tameside NHS Foundation Trust has since admitted staff failed to identify the defibrillator and switch it off at the appropriate time. It has agreed an undisclosed out-of-court settlement with the family. But Mr Williams's children today told how they have still to receive an apology two years after his death in April 2012. Daughter Lynda Beresford said she and her six siblings will never forget seeing their father in such distress. Hospital: Mr Williams was admitted to Tameside Hospital after collapsing at home with a terminal brain tumour . Lynda, 58, said: 'The whole family are absolutely devastated by the nature of my dad’s death and the care he received at Tameside Hospital. 'We had to see him suffer as the defibrillator shocked him back to life more than 30 times in just two days. Specialist medical lawyer Ayse Ince, of legal firm Irwin Mitchell which representedthe family, said: 'This is a very tragic case in which the family had to watch as their terminally ill father endured a painful and inhumane death - quite the opposite of what was intended by medical staff.' A Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'The trust unreservedly apologises to the family of Brian Williams regarding the clinical care issues experienced in 2012. 'Since this incident in 2012 there have been significant changes in regard to end of life care practice in the trust.'","Brian Williams, 77, admitted to Tameside Hospital after collapsing at home .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Jailed: Corey Davies, 20, was today jailed after killing his sister and her fiancé in a car crash in Tonyrefail, South Wales, leaving his baby nephew as an orphan . A drunk driver was today jailed after killing his sister and her fiancé in a car crash - leaving his baby nephew as an orphan. Corey Davies, 20, had been drinking 'all night' when he took Raquel Davies, 23, and 25-year-old Lee Jenkins out for a spin in his white BMW convertible near Tonyrefail, South Wales. He overtook a line of traffic on a winding A-road and hit a bank, causing the car to spin off the road and flip onto its side. Miss Davies and Mr Jenkins died instantly because the BMW's soft-top gave them no protection when it overturned, while Davies fled the scene unscathed. The couple's nine-week-old son, Harley, was left orphaned by their deaths. Today, Davies was jailed for seven years at Cardiff Crown Court after admitting two charges of causing death by dangerous driving. The court heard Davies was 'extremely drunk' and had taken cocaine to celebrate his sister's birthday when he offered to take her and her fiancé on an early morning shopping trip to Tonyrefail, near Pontyprydd. David Wooler, prosecuting, said: 'Davies was under the influence of drink and cocaine when the accident happened after an all-night drinking session to celebrate Raquel’s 23rd birthday.' Witnesses saw Davies overtake a line of traffic at up to 60mph on the A4093 near the village of Gilfach Goch, with his BMW 'twitching and snaking' on the road’s wet surface. As he sped past a Ford Transit van, the car hit banking at the side of the road and flipped onto its side, over gate and into a field. Mr Wooler said: 'Davies got out of the car and was moaning and groaning “my sister, my sister”. 'He flagged down a passing car, being driven by a friend, who thought Davies had been assaulted and took him to his mother’s house.' Victims: Davies had been drinking 'all night' when he took Raquel Davies (left), 23, and Lee Jenkins (right), 25, out for a spin in his white BMW convertible in Tonyrefail, South Wales. The couple died instantly in the crash . Davies - who broke his ribs and bruised his kidneys in the crash - then took himself to hospital, the court heard. Police later took blood tests from him and it was calculated that he had been twice the legal limit at the time. At the beginning of the hearing, Davies told the court full of relatives: 'I’m sorry to both families. If I could change anything I would have.' Davies, from Porth, Rhondda, wept uncontrollably throughout the 40-minute hearing, during which he appeared by video-link from Cardiff prison. Scene: Davies crashed after overtaking a line of traffic on the winding A4093 (pictured) near Gilfach Goch . John Hipkin, defending, said: 'No apology can put matters right. Whatever sentence the court passes the burden of what he did will remain with him for the rest of his life.' Baby Harley, who was not in the car at the time, is now being cared for by his grandmother Anne. In a victim impact statement, she told the court: 'My life with never be the same. 'I care for Harley and every time I see him I see Lee and I take some comfort from that.' The court heard Davies had a previous conviction for driving with excess alcohol, for which he had been banned from driving for 18 months. Sentencing Davies today, Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'No doubt the guilt will always be with you and will be a heavy punishment to bear. 'But you will have the opportunity to rebuild your life at the end of the sentence.' Speaking via a spokesman, Davies's family said they were devastated at having 'lost a son and a daughter'. They said: 'Raquel was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son. Court case: Today, Davies was jailed for seven years at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) after admitting two charges of causing death by dangerous driving. He has also been banned from driving for five years . 'She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out. She loved her fiance immensely.' Meanwhile, Mr Jenkins's family said in a statement: 'He loved his fiancée Raquel dearly and was enjoying being a new dad to Harley who is just nine weeks old. 'Lee was a keen and talented footballer when he was younger. We are heartbroken at the loss of Lee and will cherish all the great times and wonderful memories he gave us.' South Wales Police said the smash served as a warning to other young drivers not to get behind the wheel after drinking. Speaking after the case, Inspector Carwyn Evans said: 'This was a tragic case and Corey Davies will spend a considerable amount of time in prison. This sentence should be a warning to other drivers. 'Any driver who gets behind the wheel of a vehicle under the influence of drink or drugs and driving in the manner he did is putting their own life, the lives of other road users, and as we have seen here, the lives of loved ones in grave danger.' Davies will serve some of his seven-year prison sentence in a young offenders' institute. He has also been banned from driving for five years.","Corey Davies, 20, took Raquel Davies and Lee Jenkins for a spin in BMW .

'As this campaign goes on and the . civilian casualties in Gaza mount, Western public opinion is becoming . more and more concerned and less and less sympathetic to Israel,' he said. UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos also expressed worry about the mounting civilian casualties, saying it was 'almost impossible' for Palestinians to shelter from Israeli air strikes in the densely-populated territory.

The ban was put in place on Tuesday after a rocket hit a house very close to the runways, with Hamas hailing the suspension of Tel Aviv flights as a 'great victory'.

Turkey, . a member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance, was once Israel's . closest regional ally, but has recently become one of its most vitriolic critics. 'At . the moment, Hamas is prepared for everything in order to achieve a . ceasefire... (Palestinian President Mahmoud) Abbas is prepared too,' Erdogan told CNN news channel in an interview. 'Israel . is not even approaching such a thing and is spitting death, spitting . blood.' Mr Erdogan's comments come just days after he accused Israel of 'surpassing Hitler in barbarism' with its Gaza offensive. 'If . Israel continues with this attitude, it will definitely be tried at . international courts,' Erdogan, who is campaigning for a presidential . election on August 10, told a rally of supporters in the southern port . city of Mersin. 'We will see this happen and Turkey will struggle for this,' he told the cheering crowd.

'It . is beyond comprehension that Israel is still defended by the West and . the world is silent about it. Therefore we cannot remain silent and we . will not be silent,' he said.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Angry: Ukrainian prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk today resigned after berating parliament for failing to pass legislation to take control of the energy sector . Ukraine's prime minister today resigned after berating parliament for failing to pass legislation to take control of the energy sector. Arseny Yatseniuk, who was elected following the 2014 revolution that removed Viktor Yanukovych from power, also criticised politicans for not passing a law increasing the Army's financing. His resignation came as two parties quit a parliamentary coalition - a move that paved the way for for long-awaited early legislative elections. Despite his usual mild-mannered nature, Yatseniuk today bellowed at politicians who had failed . to pass a law to allow a liberalisation of control over Ukraine's . pipeline system. He told them they were at risk of losing the hearts and minds . of the thousands who protested for months in the 'Maidan' protests in . favour of joining Europe and against a pro-Moscow president. Addressing parliament in Kiev, he said: 'History will not forgive us.' Referring to those killed during the protests, he added: 'Millions . of people made this revolution. 'We did not take the European choice but . the ""heavenly hundred"" and thousands of other Ukrainians did.' Yatseniuk's resignation could leave a . hole at the heart of decision-making at a time when Ukraine is both struggling to fund a . war with pro-Russian rebels in its east and dealing with the aftermath . of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash that killed 298 people. Yatseniuk, who has been central to talks with the European Union and the United States, cannot leave office immediately, political analysts said, because he is obliged to oversee his duties before a new prime minister and government are installed. Address: Yatseniuk, who was elected in the revolution that removed Yanukovych from power, also criticised politicans for not passing a law increasing the Army's financing. Above, he addresses parliament in Kiev . Impassioned: He told the politicians: 'History will not forgive us. Millions of people made this revolution' But his . impassioned speech underlined the frustration of many in Ukraine that . change in the higher echelons of power was taking too much time. The . mood has also sunk in Kiev following the downing of MH17 in rebel-held . territory in eastern Ukraine last week, even though Ukrainian forces are . making headway in the military campaign against the separatists. Earlier today, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko welcomed the decision by the nationalist party Svoboda and the Udar (Punch) party of former boxing champion Vitaly Klitschko to withdraw from the majority coalition in parliament. Leaving: Arseny Yatseniuk is pictured leaving the stand after addressing the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev . 'Society . wants a full reset of state authorities,' Poroshenko said in a . statement, adding the move showed that those who decided to quit the . coalition were following the will of the people. Politicians . and political activists have complained that while Ukraine has a new . president, it has yet to elect a new parliament since the toppling of . Viktor Yanukovich in February, and accuse his supporters of hampering . its work. Yatseniuk said that by blocking legislation, like a bill to exert tighter control over the energy sector in the face of dwindling natural gas supplies from Russia, the parliament was putting Ukraine's future at risk. Disaster: Ukraine is currently dealing with the aftermath of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash that killed 298 people. Above, a convoy of hearses carries MH17 victims to military barracks in Hilversum, Holland, today . By not tackling budget spending, it was also putting the lives of Ukraine's soldiers at risk, he said. 'Our government now has no answer to the question; how are we to pay wages, how are we tomorrow morning going to send fuel for armoured vehicles, how will we pay those families who have lost soldiers, to look after the army?' he asked parliament. 'Those people who are sitting there under fire, can we just think of them?'","Arseniy Yatseniuk cited failure to pass law taking control of energy sector .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A Chinese meat factory has been shut down following allegations that it supplied out-of-date meat to American fast-food chains across the country. Shanghai Husi Food Co, a unit of U.S.-based food supplier OSI Group, was temporarily closed after allegedly selling expired chicken and beef to Chinese branches of McDonald's and KFC. A TV report showed workers apparently picking up meat from the factory floor, as well as mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh produce. Scroll down for video . Shut down: Shanghai Husi Food Co has been shut down following allegations that it supplied out-of-date meat to American fast-food chains across China. Above, employees work at the factory prior to its closure . Shockingly, employees were even heard saying that if their clients knew what they were doing, the firm would lose its contracts. McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc - owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, with over 6,200 Chinese branches collectively - immediately stopped using the supplier after the Dragon TV report aired. Meanwhile, the Shanghai office of China's food and drug agency said it was . investigating the allegations, and told customers to suspend use of the supplier's . products. 'At present, the company has been sealed and suspect products seized,' the Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration said on its website. Under investigation: The factory allegedly sold expired chicken and beef to branches of McDonald's and KFC . Angry: McDonald's (pictured) and Yum Brands Inc - owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, with over 6,200 Chinese branches collectively - immediately stopped using the supplier after the allegations became public . McDonald's . sealed 4,500 cases of beef, pork, chicken and other products supplied . by Husi for investigation, the city government said in a statement. The Communist Party secretary of . Shanghai, Han Zheng, has reportedly called for 'severe punishment' of any wrongdoing. It is the latest food safety scare for McDonald's and KFC, which were hurt by a safety scandal in 2012 involving chicken allegedly pumped with unapproved antibiotic drugs and growth hormones. Today, the chains apologised to customers following the TV report, adding that the factory had served restaurants in the Shanghai area. 'We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers,' said Yum China, which ordered all of its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory. Meanwhile a spokesman for McDonald's, which was provided with chicken, beef and lettuce by Husi, told Reuters: 'If proven, the practices outlined in the . reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald's anywhere in the . world. The fast-food branches also said they were conducting their . own investigations. China is McDonald's third-biggest market as measured in number of restaurants, while Yum's KFC, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is China's biggest . restaurant chain, with more than 4,000 outlets and plans to open 700 . more this year. 'I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms,' said Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group. Scandal: It is the latest food safety scare for McDonald's and KFC (pictured), which were hurt by a safety scandal in 2012 involving chicken allegedly pumped with unapproved antibiotic drugs and growth hormones . 'I don't know that this is something an apology can fix so easily, because at this point people don't have a whole lot of trust that they have good systems in place.' Yum shares were down 3.5 percent at $74.72 and McDonald's shares were down 0.9 percent at $98.13 on Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration shut down Husi on Sunday after the local Chinese TV broadcast aired. OSI said on its Chinese website that management was 'appalled by the report.' The company has formed its own investigation team, is fully cooperating with government inspectors and will take all necessary actions based on results of the investigation. 'Management believes this to be an isolated event, but takes full responsibility for the situation,' OSI said. OSI, which has close to 60 manufacturing facilities worldwide and had revenue of more than $5 billion in 2012, has been supplying McDonald's in China since 1992 and KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum since 2008, according to its website. News of the scare spread quickly to diners negotiating Shanghai's lunch-hour rush today. 'For now I won't go to eat at McDonald's or KFC, at least until this whole thing settles down,' said Xu Xinyu, 24, a financial services worker, eating at a noodle shop near a McDonald's outlet in downtown Shanghai. Yet some Chinese consumers appear to have developed a comparatively thick skin when it comes to food scandals. 'Isn't everywhere like this?' asked student Li Xiaoye, 20, eating a beef burger in a Shanghai McDonald's outlet. 'I'll keep going because wherever I eat, the issues are all the same.' The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011. OSI is one of McDonald's key meat suppliers and has a good reputation, according to an industry insider speaking on condition of anonymity. He added the incident highlighted the issue firms faced enforcing strict processes with local staff. As well as Yum and McDonald's, OSI listed Starbucks Corp , Japan's Saizeriya Co Ltd, Papa John's International Inc, Burger King Worldwide Inc and Doctor's Associates Inc's Subway brand as clients in China, according to a 2012 press release. A Starbucks spokesman told Reuters that the company does not now have any direct business dealings with Husi Food. Burger King, Subway, Papa John's and Saizeriya did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A woman who answered the phone at Husi's headquarters said no one was available to comment. But a company manager, Yang Liqun, told Xinhua News Agency that Husi has a strict . quality control system and will cooperate in the investigation.","Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd temporarily shut down by Chinese authorities .

Helen Smith thought she would never see her pet dog Snowy again after she disappeared four years ago. The Parson Russell Terrier had been playing in her owner’s garden in Hook, Hampshire, before she vanished in a suspected theft in October 2010. But the 13-year-old dog is now back home after she was found wandering along a dual carriageway in Portsmouth, more than 40 miles away.

Miss Smith said she was worried that Snowy would not recognise her as she had poor eyesight and was due to have a cataract operation before she went missing.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A Chinese shopping mall has installed a plus-sized, women-only zone to cater for female drivers who have trouble parking. The zone, marked with a sign reading: 'Respectfully reserved for women', is situated outside the World Metropolis (Dashijiedaduhui) centre in Dalian in north-east China's Liaoning province. It features ten parking spaces which are painted pink and around 30 centimetres wider than normal. Women-only: The World Metropolis centre in Dalian has installed a plus-sized, women-only zone to cater for female drivers who have trouble parking. Above, the centre's manager Yang Hongjun speaks in the zone . It is the latest in a string of women-only zones to have emerged in car parks across China, where the middle class is bulging and more people have the income necessary to buy and drive vehicles. Other places to have introduced them include Wanxiang-Tiancheng shopping centre in Shijiazhuang city, Hebei province, and a building materials mall in Tianjin, northern China. The pink-ringed parking spaces have sparked debate in China, which officially embraces gender equality but where old-fashioned sexism is rife in reality. The World Metropolis, situated in the centre of the northern port city of Dalian, is one of thousands of other retail complexes to have sprouted across the country as part of a vast urbanisation drive. Wide: The zone features ten parking spaces which are painted pink and around 30 cms wider than normal . Pink-ringed: It is marked with a sign reading: 'Respectfully reserved for women.' Above, the parking spaces . It features dozens of chain clothing stores, fast food franchises, glass lifts, a cinema, and Starbucks, which has become a favourite hangout of China's new middle class. According to its management, the plus-sized, women-only spaces were created outside its main entrance after female drivers had trouble parking in the standard basement slots. 'I think this is very convenient,' user Yong Mei told AFP. 'Other parking spaces are too narrow.' She added: 'It's not gender biased. It's just that women have a few issues with vision when parking.' But the spaces have provoked outrage on social media - with many accusing the shopping centre of sexism and cliched thinking. 'This is supposed to respect women, but actually it's an insult,' said an unnamed woman. Today, the mall's manager, Yang Hongjun, defended the larger pink-ringed parking spots, deeming them 'practical'. 'We just wanted to make things easier for women, who make up most of our customers,' she said. 'It's not an insult to women at all. If their parking spaces are larger, it's only for practical reasons. It doesn't mean that women drive less well than men.' However, the policy appears to be at odds with statistics on driving fatalities. A study titled 'Basic Characteristics . of Road Traffic Deaths in China' published last January, revealed there . were more than 67,000 people killed in road traffic crashes, including . parking incidents, in 2009. One . of the significant risk factors was gender. But contrary to the . apparent belief of the shopping mall planners, men have a far higher . risk of crashing then women. In the study, fatal crashes by male drivers were more than three times than that of female drivers. Lower car insurance quotes for women than men also suggests that women are safer drivers, regardless of reputation. Ladies only: It is the latest in a string of women-only zones to have emerged in car parks across China. Above, this building materials mall in Tianjin, northern China, introduced a pink women-only parking zone last year . Officially, China proclaims the sexes equal in keeping with Communist principles, and revolutionary Mao Zedong once said that 'women hold up half the sky'. But conservative attitudes remain deeply ingrained, and women are conspicuous by their rarity in the upper echelons of Chinese politics and the ruling party, dominated by men in black suits. One online poster on the Dalian car park said: 'The two most dangerous things in the world are men who cook and women who drive.' Manufacturers' advertisements in the world's biggest auto market are invariably aimed at male buyers, and a man at the mall, Wu Zhicun, said: 'Women don't really know how to park a car.' 'The few times I've come close to crashing was basically with women driving the other car,' he added. 'I've noticed they're a bit rough at the wheel, they only look forwards, too often they ignore their mirrors.' The latest Chinese controversy echoes a series of microblog posts Beijing police made last year advising women on driving techniques. These included not wearing high heels, releasing the handbrake before setting off and not panicking if they suddenly realise they are going the wrong way. 'Some women drivers lack a sense of direction, and while driving a car, they often hesitate and are indecisive about which road they should take,' read one of the entries on the police department's verified microblog. Another featured a cartoon depicting a confrontation between a police officer and a woman driving a vehicle shaped like a large red high-heel shoe. According to a World Health Organization . estimate in March 2013, globally males are more likely to be involved in . accidents than females, and 77 percent of all road traffic deaths occur . among men. Even so, for some, the women-only parking places amounted to discrimination against male drivers. 'It's always women who enjoy privileges!' complained one. 'Men have become the weaker sex.' The news comes just months after similar spaces were introduced for female drivers at another shopping centre in Seoul, South Korea.","Spaces installed at the World Metropolis centre in Dalian, north-east China .

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Sophie Jane Evans . 'It frightens me': Baroness Campbell, who was born with severe spinal muscular atrophy, made a moving intervention against assisted dying yesterday . Baroness Campbell, who has battled a degenerative disease for half a century, made a moving intervention against assisted dying yesterday, saying: 'This offers no comfort to me - it frightens me.' The Baroness of Surbiton was addressing a marathon 10-hour debate in . the House of Lords on whether terminally ill patients should be helped . to die if they wish. Breathing through a ventilator, she said Lord Falconer's Bill was aimed at her whether she wanted it or not, saying: 'I did not ask it and I do not want it, but it is about me nevertheless.' Baroness Campbell, who was born with severe spinal muscular atrophy, said that in moments of despair, she might be tempted to ask for assisted dying - and if the law changed, doctors would not stop her. She told peers: 'It frightens me because . in periods of greatest difficulty I know I might be tempted to use it. It only adds to the burdens and challenges life holds for me.' Lord Falconer of Thoroton, a long-term . campaigner for the right to die, has proposed that people with less than . six months to live be allowed to kill themselves with a lethal dose of . drugs prepared – but not administered – by a doctor. He said his proposed law . contained enough safeguards to prevent abuses and would be used in . ‘limited’ circumstances to alleviate terrible suffering. It is completely different from the euthanasia laws in Holland and Belgium which he rejects, he said. A . patient would only be allowed to take their own life if they are judged . to have the mental capacity to make the choice – and after an . examination by two doctors. The law excludes those, like Baroness Campbell, who are not deemed terminally ill, according to the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Debate: The Baroness, pictured in December 2012, was addressing a marathon 10-hour debate in the House of Lords on whether terminally ill patients should be helped to die if they wish . But . the peer told her fellows that the Bill would also affect people like . her, saying: 'Before anyone disputes this, imagine that it is already . law and that I ask for assistance to die. 'Do your Lordships think that I would be refused? You can be sure that there would be doctors and lawyers willing to support my right to die.' A record 130 peers put their names down to speak at the Bill’s second reading. On both sides of the debate, peers told of the appalling suffering of loved ones. Lord . Tebbit, whose wife was left paralysed by an IRA bomb, made a an . impassioned warning against assisted dying, saying ‘the road to hell is . paved with good intentions’. ‘Many people, caring so much for those they leave behind, are dying earlier and alone because they fear implicating their loved ones in a criminal enterprise. They hoard pills or put a plastic bag over their head when they are alone. It is time for a change in the law.’ Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who proposed the Bill ‘When suffering is so great, when patients know they are at the end of life, make repeated pleas to die, it seems a denial of loving compassion which is the hallmark of Christianity to refuse to fulfil their own clearly stated request.’ Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury ‘I get very angry when those who oppose the Bill misrepresent what it is actually proposing and fail to mention how limited its aims intentionally are. It applies only to those who are already terminally ill yet still in sound mind who want, as we all surely do, some control or say in the manner of their own death. It has nothing to do with coercing vulnerable old people into killing themselves.’ Labour peer Lord Howarth . ‘The Bill would provide a route to great savings in public and private expenditure, and to a great pressure on the elderly, the sick and the disabled to do the decent thing and cease to be a burden on others. Those who care for such people are all too familiar with the moments of black despair that prompt those words, “I would be better dead, so that you could get on with your life”.’Lord Tebbit, former cabinet minister whose wife was left paralysed by the Brighton bomb ‘This Bill has broad categories into which anyone can be shoe-horned and it comes within a whisker of full-blown euthanasia. Are there safeguards? No, there are only broad categories into which you will find some doctor who would state that almost anyone fits.’ Baroness Finlay of Llandaff, former president of the Royal College of Medicine . ‘It frightens me because . in periods of greatest difficulty I know I might be tempted to use it. It only adds to the burdens and challenges life holds for me.’ Baroness Campbell of Surbiton . Since his wife Margaret was seriously injured by the Brighton bomb in 1984, . the Tory former cabinet minister said he had come to know the ‘moments . of black despair which prompt those words: “I would be better dead so . that you could get on with your life”.’ But he implored fellow peers not to . change the law, as he feared it would be a ‘breeding ground for . vultures’ seeking to profit from the deaths of frail elderly relatives. He . described the case of an elderly lady he spoke to who said she wished . to leave her assets to charity, as she had no children, but feared her . family would find a way to claim them. Plea: Lord Tebbit and his wife Margaret who was left paralysed by the Brighton bombing in 1984 . ‘“You . see”, she said, “I have no children but I have several vultures . awaiting my death”. This Bill will be a breeding ground for vultures, . individual and corporate. It creates too much financial incentive for . the taking of life.’ The . model Lord Falconer has followed is that introduced in the US state of . Oregon, which he said was only used 80 times last year. But . opponent Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the Paralympic gold-medallist, . said that as Oregon has only 3million people, if the same trend was . replicated in the UK some 1,600 people a year could take their own lives . in doctors’ surgeries or Dignitas-style clinics. Many raised concerns about whether the agreement of two doctors would really be sought. Lord Tebbit highlighted the disclosure . last year that doctors were secretly authorising abortions on grounds . of sex selection, by pre-signing forms for women they had never met. Baroness . Finlay of Llandaff, former president of the Royal Society of Medicine, . warned that fellow GPs had counter-signed the 176 cremation forms for . patients murdered by Harold Shipman. Lord . Falconer’s Bill will be scrutinised by a committee later in the year. Although it puts the highly-charged issue back on the political agenda, . it is unlikely to proceed further. The Mail reported last week how a Dutch academic who used to support euthanasia warned the UK not to adopt assisted dying. Theo Boer said: ‘Once the genie is out of the bottle, it is not likely ever to go back in again.’ Campaigner: Lord Falconer of Thoroton (pictured), a long-term campaigner for the right to die, has proposed that terminally-ill people be allowed to kill themselves with a lethal dose of drugs prepared by a doctor .","Baroness Campbell of Surbiton said Lord Falconer's Bill 'frightened' her .

The pair apparently had 'a few drinks' and kissed in front of friends at the Mexican bar, club and restaurant, which is owned by Harry's best friend Guy Pelly and frequented by the royals. A source told The Sun: 'They looked very cosy and kissed more than once. But they are not serious in any way. They're just two young people having a good time.' They added: 'It's probably unlikely they will see each other again - they are both very busy.' Miss Thurlow - who shares her first name with Harry's stepmother, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall - works for The Halo Trust, a mine clearance charity with which Diana, Princess of Wales was heavily involved.

Her current work with The Halo Trust involves acting as a project officer in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Her alleged 'clinch' with Harry was reportedly spotted during a World Cup-themed party, in which bare-chested men waved sparklers and tequila shots were delivered on a train. It comes just a day after the Prince's ex-girlfriend Cressida was seen sporting a huge smile on her face as she headed home from the Rosemary Branch Theatre following her latest performance. The 25-year-old dressed down for the occasion in a blue outfit and covered her top half with a bright blue T-shirt, while carrying her possessions in a black handbag. She also opted for comfort in her choice of shoes - donning a pair of white trainers. It was Cressida's first play since she split from Harry in April following a two-year relationship.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Star: Lindsay Lohan was ordered to wear an alcohol-monitoring tag after failing to show up for a probation hearing relating to a drink-driving case in 2007 . She was famously ordered to wear one after failing to show up for a probation hearing relating to a drink-driving case. Now, Hollywood star Lindsey Lohan's 'booze bracelet' will be fitted to alcohol-fuelled thugs in Britain. Courts will have the power to issue the U.S.-style electronic tag, which records the wearer’s alcohol intake by measuring air and perspiration emissions from the skin every 30 minutes . At least once every 24 hours, the bracelet is connected to the internet to send alcohol levels to the probation officer. If the blood or sweat has an alcohol level of more than 0.02 then it will be followed up by a visit by the authorities. The bracelet, often attached to the ankle, will be piloted in South London next month and could soon be rolled out across England and Wales. It will handed to thugs in the boroughs of Croydon, Lambeth, Southwark and Sutton alongside community or suspended sentences, and can be sanctioned for up to four months. Offenders will either be given a limit that they are allowed to drink, or banned from consuming alcohol together. Judges must be satisfied that alcohol was . a contributing factor to the committed offence, but that the defendant . is not an alcoholic in need of treatment. The tag is part of the Alcohol Abstinence and Monitoring scheme, which aims to reduce the level of alcohol-related crime, ensure offenders face a 'robust' punishment and make the public safer by 'breaking the cycle of alcohol-related crime'. Film star Lohan was fitted with a U.S.-made SCRAM - Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitory - tag in . 2007 after she failed to show up for a probation hearing relating to a . drink-driving case. She was later ordered to wear another . alcohol-monitoring bracelet in 2010 after a judge ruled she had failed . to complete alcohol education classes imposed as part of her sentencing . for the case. Punishment: Courts will have the power to issue the U.S.-style electronic tag (pictured, a SCRAM tag), which records the convict's alcohol intake by measuring air and perspiration emissions from the skin every half hour . Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said she was 'encouraged' to see the scheme enter the UK, saying: 'About half of all crime is alcohol related so it’s encouraging to see pilots like this.' However, the makers of SCRAM warned that while exercise is not an issue, spray tans and perfumes containing alcohol could accidentally set off the tag's sensor. There have also been occasions in the US where eating a yeasty bread or bread with lots of raisins has triggered the alarm, according to reports. A spokesman for the Mayor's Office told MailOnline: 'The Alcohol Abstinence and Monitoring scheme will be piloted in the London boroughs of Sutton, Croydon, Lambeth and Southwark from July 31. 'The Alcohol Abstinence and Monitoring Requirement (AAMR) requirement is already law. Under the AAMR, an individual can be required to abstain from alcohol for a fixed period of time as part of a community order or suspended sentence order. 'An order has been signed by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to commence the pilot.' The 'booze bracelet' senses the body’s intake of any alcohol by measuring air and perspiration emissions from the skin every 30 minutes. At least once every 24 hours, the tag is connected to the internet to send alcohol levels to the probation officer.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A coroner has condemned an NHS trust for its 'woefully inadequate' investigation after a baby died when surgeons cut into his skull during an emergency Caesarean section. Carson Allen died from a massive haemorrhage just hours after he was born prematurely at Nottingham City Hospital on July 3 last year. Doctors pierced a soft part of his skull while cutting into the wall of his mother's womb, causing severe blood loss, an inquest heard. Grieving: Baby Carson Allen died from a massive haemorrhage just hours after he was born prematurely at Nottingham City Hospital on July 3 last year. Above, Carson's heartbroken parents, Claire Smith and Scott Allen . Assistant coroner for Nottinghamshire Heidi Connor recorded a verdict of accidental death. But she criticised Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust for its 'woefully inadequate' investigation into the tragedy. Following the hearing on Thursday, Carson's heartbroken mother Claire Smith, 38, a carer from Top Valley, Nottingham, said she would 'never forgive' the hospital for her son's death. In a statement released with her partner Scott Allen, 37, after the verdict, she said: 'From start to finish, my care was absolutely horrendous. Hospital: An inquest heard during a C-section, doctors pierced a soft part of Carson's kull while cutting into the wall of his mother's womb. Above, the maternity ward at Nottingham City Hospital, where the newborn died . 'I will never forgive them': Miss Smith said she would 'never forgive' the hospital for her newborn son's death . Newborn babies' skulls consist of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These . are joined by soft spots - or 'fontanelles - which enable the bony . plates of their skulls to flex and change shape during birth. This allows babies' heads to pass through the narrow birth canal. The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close by nine to 18 months. Meanwhile, the sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of a baby's life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. 'When I eventually went into labour the doctor didn't seem to believe me but I assured her I was having the baby. 'For Carson's life to end in the way it did is unacceptable. During my C-section, the doctor cut my baby's head so deep that he died. I will never forgive them for what they did.' During the inquest, Miss Smith recalled the heartbreaking moment she found out her baby had died. 'I woke up and asked Scott what we'd had. I could not understand why he wasn't happy,' she said. 'I heard someone say ""he's had two cardiac arrests"" and I felt sorry for the person whose baby it was - then I realised it was my baby. 'Then I heard someone say he had a defect on his head.' The inquest heard Miss Smith had been 33 weeks pregnant when she went into labour and was taken to Nottingham City Hospital for an emergency C-section. Dr Habiba Kapaya, assisted by consultant Andrew Simm, cut into her womb with a scalpel and managed to deliver Carson, but then discovered he was haemorrhaging from a wound to his head. He was treated in intensive care and given oxygen because he also had underdeveloped lungs, while doctors fought to stop the bleeding. But tragically, nothing could be done to save the newborn and he died three hours later. Mr Simm told the inquest that around one per cent of babies suffer cuts during a Caesarian section, saying: 'I could not see how a scalpel could cut through bone.' But paediatric pathologist Dr David O'Neil, who conducted the post-mortem, said he thought the doctors had cut into the baby's skull while cutting through the uterus wall. Blasted: Assistant coroner for Nottinghamshire Heidi Connor recorded a verdict of accidental death. But she criticised Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust for its 'woefully inadequate' investigation into the tragedy . He told the hearing: 'It was at the back end of the temporal bones - made up of five bones that come together. 'There is a gap between them and there would be no problem opening up a skull with a scalpel blade in that area.' The . inquest heard that mother-of-two Miss Smith underwent a gynaecological . procedure to treat heavy periods in 2011 that increased the risk of miscarriage and pre-term labour. Distraught: Miss Smith had been 33 weeks pregnant when she went into labour and was taken to Nottingham City Hospital for an emergency C-section . Miss Smith said that when she found out she was expecting Carson in 2013, she had told doctors she had previously undergone the operation - the exact details of which were not disclosed. Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Mrs Connor said: 'Carson's head was closer to the side of the uterus than normal because of the previous surgery. 'I want to make this clear - this is not something that happens in a standard Caesarean section.' Following the hearing, the parents' solicitors Nelsons said it was a 'very tragic case' and they were considering whether to take further action. A statement from the hospital said the surgery was performed by a senior team and the complication was 'extremely rare'. Dr Stephen Fowlie, Nottingham University Hospital's medical director, said: 'We reiterate our condolences to Miss Smith and her family for their loss. 'Carson was delivered by emergency section to maximise his chances of survival. 'The operation was performed by a senior and competent team of doctors. 'Sadly there were complications that could not have been foreseen. 'The pathologist concluded that this extremely rare complication caused Carson's death. 'It will never be known whether had this not occurred, Carson would have survived.'","Carson Allen died from massive hemorrhage just hours after he was born .

But it could be a thing of the past if a trial of electronic tags proves successful. Orange tags worn by festival goers use radio waves to keep track of friends, instead of relying on mobile phone reception, which can be patchy if not non-existent at large outdoor events. Scroll down for video . Orange tags (pictured) worn by festival goers use radio waves to keep track of friends, instead of relying on mobile phone reception, which can be patchy if not non-existent at large outdoor events . What: Electronic tags are designed to be worn by festival goers. Why: Up to five people can keep constantly in touch. The main tracking unit connects with up to four tags. How: The tags use radio waves to determine people's locations and guide the person with the main tag to their friends, by following beeps and flashing lights to point them in the right direction. Range: 1,640ft or 500 metres. On trial: The device was used last weekend at Global Gathering near Stratford-upon-Avon. IT will be trialled at Kendal Calling in Cumbria, Bloodstock in Derbyshire and the Tough Mudder events throughout the UK events in August. Release date: There is no news whether the prototype device will be launched or when. Price: No pricing details are available. The durable devices, which have a long charge, can keep up to five people constantly in touch and have a range of 1,640ft (500metres). The main tracking unit connects with up to four tags and uses a beeper and LED lights to point the user in the direction of their friends. It has been dubbed the world’s first festival friend finder by its makers – the spirit brand Jägermeister – and will be used by festival goers at Kendal Calling in Cumbria, Bloodstock in Derbyshire and the Tough Mudder events throughout the UK events in August. The tags can be attached to festival lanyards and wristbands or can be left at a tent of meeting point to guide festival goers back to a comfortable sleeping bag after a night of dancing.

The main tracking unit connects with up to four tags (both pictured) and uses a beeper and an LED display to point the user in the direction of their friends . The Festival Friend Finder has an alert button, which signals to all friends with trackers that its wearer needs help and can also notify them if they've strayed too far from the main stage or their tent. Robert Turner, from Northampton, was one of the first people to try it out this at Global Gathering, which took place bear Stratford-upon-Avon last weekend. ‘This is a brilliant idea and saved me spending ages trawling through the crowds trying to find the lads and also meant we didn't miss any of the acts we came to see,’ he said. The tags can be attached to festival lanyards (pictured) and wristbands or can be left at a tent or meeting point to guide festival goers back to a comfortable sleeping bag after a night of dancing . ‘If they make these available to buy, I'm definitely getting one - I don't know how I'll do without it now.’ Samantha Green, Jägermeister Events Manager, said: ‘These events are all about sharing the amazing experience with friends and creating long lasting memories which groups of mates can look back on in years to come, and so we really hope this prototype will be in the hands of all festival-goers one day soon’. Currently, the Festival Friend Finder gadget is only a prototype under development and there are no details about when it may become available to buy, or how much it might cost. The device and tags (pictured) have been dubbed the world's first festival friend finder by its makers - the spirit brand Jägermeister - and will be used by festival goers at Kendal Calling, Bloodstock and the Tough Mudder events in August .","The orange tags are designed to be worn by festival goers and use radio waves to keep friends in touch instead of relying on mobile phone reception .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . People have used a mouse to control their computers ever since the machines became mainstream enough to invade the home. But now there is a new batch of hands-free technology that claims to be more intuitive, accurate than fun than the handy hardware, which was invented around 70 years ago. A start-up called Thalmic Labs, based in Waterloo, Ontario in Canada, is about to release a smart armband that lets people control their computers by using hand gestures. The Myo band (pictured) lets people control their computers by using hand gestures - some of which are pre-set and others which will evolve over time . Software: Thin design housing an ARM Cortex M4 processor and haptic feedback . Communication: Bluetooth 4.0 low energy . Sensors: Proprietary EMG muscle activity sensors, and a three axis gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer . Power: Micro USB . Charging: Rechargeable lithium ion battery . Weight: 95grams . Colours: Black and white . Shipping date: September 2014 . Cost: $149 (£87) The Myo band can do this because it contains sensors that measure the motion and electrical activity in the wearer’s arm muscles. From this information, it can interpret certain hand gestures as well as movements to execute the relevant instructions on a computer screen. This is different to some competing controllers, such as Microsoft’s Kinect, which relies on a camera to monitor someone’s movements. A final version of the $149 (£87 plus shipping) device is set to be released in September and its makers claim it will work with Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. The armband (pictured) lets people control their computer by using pre-set hand gestures . The armband can do this because it contains sensors that measure the motion and electrical activity in the wearer's arm muscles (illustrated) It connects with compatible computers and tablets via a Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy connection. The device contains a Lithium Ion battery, which can be recharged so that it can be used for a few days. Weighing in at around the same as a chunky wristwatch, the device is designed to fit almost any arm because it can be worn in different ways, as long as it is positioned on the upper forearm. ‘Our team has put countless hours into creating the sleek design, as well as the technology inside of it,’ said Stephen Lake, CEO and Co-founder of Thalmic Labs. ‘This final design is rugged, while also being lightweight, making it easy for the Myo armband to become a part of our everyday lives.’ The team of engineers who created the device have pre-set some gestures for users to learn, but these will be added to by developers. The firm says that with time, a number of apps will also be available after launch. It could be adapted to control TVs and radio-controlled cars, giving people a break from hunting for mislaid remote controls.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For decades children – and adults – have cowered behind a cushion when the shape-shifting T-1000 robot assassin hunted Arnold Schwarzenegger in the hit movie Terminator 2. But the terrifying technology is closer to becoming a reality now that scientists have created a sophisticated form-changing material. that could allow robots to switch between hard and soft shapes. The material, that could lead to a new generation of droids, is able to morph into different states thanks to its precise mixture of wax and foam. Scroll down for video . The new material (pictured) is made from wax and foam so it can change form easily. The material in on the left, is cool so its wax coating is rigid, while the one on the right does not have a wax coating and collapses under weight. By heating a wax coating, it could be as flexible, and could regain its rigid form again with cooling . wax coating, while the one on the right is uncoated and remains compliant (here, it collapses under a wrench) To build a material capable of shifting between squishy and rigid states, the researchers coated a foam structure in wax. They chose foam because it can be squeezed into a small fraction of its normal size, but once released will bounce back to its original shape. The wax coating, meanwhile, can change from a hard outer shell to a soft, pliable surface with moderate heating. This could be done by running a wire along each of the coated foam struts and then applying a current to heat up and melt the surrounding wax. Turning off the current again would allow the material to cool down and return to its rigid state. In addition to switching the material to its soft state, heating the wax in this way would also repair any damage sustained. In the 1991 film, Judgment Day, the shape-shifting T-1000 robotic U.S. agent was made of liquid metal, allowing him to morph into a fluid state and squeeze through tight spaces as well as repairing himself when injured. It is hoped that the new material, which was developed by Anette Hosoi, a professor of mechanical engineering and applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT) could give real robots similar capabilities at a low cost. Their material could be used to build deformable surgical robots, which would move through the body to reach a particular point without damaging any of the organs or vessels along the way. Robots built from the material, described in a new paper in the journal Macromolecular Materials and Engineering, could also be used in search-and-rescue operations to squeeze through rubble looking for survivors, Professor Hosoi explained. In the 1991 film, Judgment Day, the shape-shifting T-1000 robotic U.S. agent (pictured) was made of liquid metal, allowing him to morph into a fluid state and squeeze through tight spaces as well as repairing himself when injured. The new material could facilitate shape-shifting powers in the future . To build a material capable of shifting between squishy and rigid states, the researchers coated a foam lattice structure in wax. They chose foam because it can be squeezed into a small fraction of its normal size, but once released, will bounce back to its original shape. The wax coating, meanwhile, can change from a hard outer shell to a soft, pliable surface with moderate heating. Professor Hosoi said that this could be done by running a wire along each of the coated foam ‘struts,’ before applying a current to heat up and melt the surrounding wax. Turning off the current again would allow the material to cool down and return to its rigid state. In addition to switching the material to its soft state, heating the wax in this way would also repair any damage sustained, she said. ‘This material is self-healing. So if you push it too far and fracture the coating, you can heat it and then cool it, and the structure returns to its original configuration,’ Professor Hosoi explained. Here, the 3D-printed soft, flexible scaffold that is coated in wax, is being compressed in a temperature-controlled chamber. Heating a composite where the wax coating has broken can enable the wax to soften and 'heal' to restore its original strength and properties . To build the material, the researchers simply placed the polyurethane foam in a bath of melted wax. They then squeezed the foam to encourage it to soak up the wax, said co-author of the study Nadia Cheng. ‘A lot of materials innovation can be very expensive, but in this case you could just buy really low-cost polyurethane foam and some wax from a craft store,’ she said. The wax coating could be replaced by a stronger material, such as solder. Working with robotics experts, the researchers began looking at ‘squishy robots,’ which are capable of squeezing through tight spaces and then expanding again, much like octopuses do. But useful robots need to exert a reasonable amount of force on their surroundings in order to be useful. Professor Hosoi said: ‘You can't just create a bowl of Jell-O, because if the Jell-O has to manipulate an object, it would simply deform without applying significant pressure to the thing it was trying to move.’ ‘If you're trying to squeeze under a door, for example, you should opt for a soft state, but if you want to pick up a hammer or open a window, you need at least part of the machine to be rigid.'","Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created the shape-shifting material from wax and foam .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Long distance lovers can speak for hours online using video services like Skype, but holding hands has been impossible, until now. Scientists have created a wireless accessory that lets you hold your partner’s hand from anywhere in the world. It uses haptic technology to mimic the sensation of someone giving you a reassuring squeeze of the hand, using a pair of two small devices. Scroll down for video . Scientists have created a wireless accessory called Frebble (pictured) that lets you hold your partner's hand from anywhere in the world. It can be used alongside video chat services such as Skype so that people can see, hear and feel each other . Frebble uses haptic technology, or ‘tactile feedback’ to mimic the sensation of hand-holding through two devices. Once the Frebbles have connected to each other through the internet, when one user squeezes their device, the other user will feel the sensation of their hand being held. They do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of each device to register squeezing, two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real, and one integrated ‘squeeze bar’ to replicate holding hands. A multicolour LED will indicate connection status and when a squeeze is waiting. Frebble is the brainchild of entrepreneur Frederic Petrignani, of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He is currently raising funds on Kickstarter to put the devices into production. The Bluetooth device is not only intended to give people in long-distance relationships an extra way of communicating. ‘For a granddaughter calling grandma with special news, for a husband far away from a wife, for distant grown daughters who crave the comfort of their mother’s touch, for a best friend who wants to let her friend know it will all be ok, Frebble connects – as simply, subtly and as powerfully as though the person was right there with you,’ the company says. ‘While there are many ways to see and hear your loved ones through the power of the internet, the tactile element has been missing – until now. With Frebble, you can cut through the distance and share that smallest gesture – the squeeze of the hand – that means so much.’ It uses haptic technology to mimic the sensation of someone giving you a reassuring squeeze of the hand, using two small devices. This diagram shows how the device can be used alonside different video chat services . The device is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in the hand and simulate the touch of holding and squeezing another person’s hand – and having that feeling reciprocated. When a Frebble is squeezed by one person, the corresponding gadget will gently apply pressure to the back of a partner's hand, to simulate holding hands, wherever they may be . It will do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of the device to register squeezing, two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real, and one integrated ‘squeeze bar’ to replicate holding hands.

The Bluetooth device is not only intended to give people in long-distance relationships an extra way of communicating. The company says that it ideal for parents and grandparents keeping in touch (illustrated) and best friends living far away from each other . Frebbles, which each measure around five inches long, contain a rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery and are made from plastic with rubberised padded areas so it can be gripped easily. A device can be used for four hours and lasts longer on standby. The gadgets will be able to be recharged using a micro-USB cable and will work with Google Chrome version24 or higher and Firefox version 16 and higher. Android and iOS apps for smartphones and tablets will also be available by September, when Frebble is due to be shipped.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Few people pop to the supermarket and discover a new species. But DNA testing has revealed that three unnamed species of mushroom that are new to science have been found in a bag of dried porcini that came off a shop shelf in London. While porcini mushrooms are served in many restaurants, relatively little is known about them scientifically. Discovery in the bag: DNA testing has revealed that three unnamed species of mushroom have been found in a bag dried porcini (pictured) that came off a shop shelf in London . The porcini mushroom is a type of fungus in the genus Bolestus. They can be found in Europe, Asia and North America and have only been introduced to the southern hemisphere relatively recently. The mushrooms grow in deciduous and coniferous forests, typically enveloping a tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. Porcini are popular in cooking - despite species unknown to science being traded internationally. The mushrooms are low in fat and carbohydrates and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and fibre. Because they are quite difficult to cultivate all your round, they are often dried and packaged. To explore the nature of the popular cooking ingredient, mycologists Bryn Dentinger and Laura Martinez-Suz of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in south west London, sequenced the DNA of a bag of dried Chinese porcini. There were 15 pieces of mushroom in the bag and all them belonged to three unnamed species, indicating that experts know relatively little about the vast group of fungi. Boletus is one of the most traded wild and edible mushroom in the world and many types are exported from China. They can come from remote regions without any reliable identification, raising the spectre that some less palatable or even dangerous types could possibly slip through the net undetected. Scientists have previously proved that unknown species of the edible mushroom are sold, but the experts from Kew said they were surprised that they found some so easily. ‘The finding demonstrates the ubiquity of unknown fungal diversity, even in traded products and the recognition of these species will enable better regulations to improve food safety and enable countries to adhere to international agreements on the exploitation of wild species,’ experts at Kew said. Mysterious mushrooms: There were 15 pieces of mushroom in the bag and all them belonged to three unnamed species, indicating that experts know little about the vast group of fungi, even if they are widely used in cooking. A pasta dish is pictured . While mushrooms are most commonly used in cooking, some scientists think that they have the potential to save the world. Ascocoryne . sarcoides can be used to make biofuel. Its volatile compounds are . similar to those found in diesel and can turn dead leaf matter into . fuel. Laricifomes officinalis could be used to make a 'universal insecticide'. Mycelium from various mushrooms is a flexible polymer similar to plastic and can be used to make biodegradable materials. Most of a mushroom’s power lies beneath the soil in a bundle of filaments called that mycelium that secrete enzymes capable of breaking down soil and rocks. They also produce potent chemicals to defend their territory, and release nutrients into the soil. And it is this mycelium that is of predominant interest to mycologists, who believe mushrooms could be used to produce superior drugs and green materials of the future, New Scientist reported. One microbiologist has developed a biofuel after discovering that a wood-decaying fungus called Ascocoryne sarcoides contains volatile compounds comparable to the type found in diesel fuels. And Eben Bower, CEO of Ecovative, has created a flexible polymer-like plastic from fungus that is biodegradable and can be persuaded to grow in different densities to produce a variety of materials and properties. It is already used to make packaging and could be harnessed to make more permanent products in the future. A company called Fungi Perfecti is working on making a 'universal insecticide' from a type of fungus called Lacrifomes officinalis.","Experts from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, in south west London, sequenced the DNA of the mushrooms in the bag .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . An abundance of low quality cork trees with thin bark may be ruining the quality of wine corks. The reasons for the lower quality of trees, which has steadily declined for 20 years, can be attributed to climate change according to a team of researchers. The bark of the trees might be being chemically changed by increased exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of climate change. Research led by University of Lisbon says the quality of wine corks is decreasing. They say this is due to thinning bark on the trees that produce wine corks, known as Quercus suber trees (pictured). They have seen a drastic decline in quality in 20 years, and thinner bark means the corks are worse at keeping air out of bottles . Enjoying the perfect glass of wine doesn't require you to shell out a lot of money on the most expensive bottle you can find. Instead, the results of the world's largest multisensory wine experiment reveal that a simple change in colour and sound can affect the taste of wine by nearly 10 per cent. Listening to supposedly 'sweet' and 'sour' music in a room with red or green lighting can significantly alter the taste of a glass of wine, according to the research . The full findings suggest red light and 'sweet' music is the ideal combination, increasing enjoyment by as much as nine per cent. Green light and 'sour' music increased freshness and reduced intensity by 14 per cent. ‘It’s the same as someone moving from being ambivalent about the taste of something to really liking it,' said Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University Charles Spence. 'And, with this experiment, that shift happened in seconds.' The research, reported by Live Science, indicates are rather more unexpected consequence of climate change. The genetic study was led by Dr Rita Teixeira of the University of Lisbon and shows how the £1.2 billion ($2 billion) cork industry is at risk. While cork struggles to maintain its consistency, plastic and metal wine stoppers are on the rise. To produce a good product, cork producers need bark at least one inch (25 millimetres) thick - if the cork is too thin it will let air into the bottle and ruin the wine. But the trees, called Quercus suber trees, have undergone a drastic decrease in quality to the point where there bark is now as little as 0.1 inches (three millimetres) thick - just 10 per cent the optimum level. The reason for this dramatic drop in just two decades was unknown but now Dr Teixeira and colleagues think the blame can be pointed at climate change – although she says there could be other culprits. ‘There are several factors like climate change, landscape changes and the dry seasons getting longer that could be causing the decline,' Dr Teixeira from the University of Lisbon told Live Science. ‘The change in bark quality may be the trees' way of adapting.’ To produce a good cork (stock image shown), producers need bark at least one inch (25 millimetres) thick - if the cork is too thin it will let air into the bottle and ruin the wine. But the trees have undergone a drastic decrease in quality to the point where there bark is now as little as 0.1 inches (three millimetres) thick . The trees grow only in southwest Europe and northwest Africa. In their research the team analysed the genes of five high-quality and five low-quality cork trees in Portugal. It was found the bad quality trees were much higher in compounds to protect themselves from the additional ultraviolet radiation, at the expense of bark thickness. This suggests the trees are adapting to the increase in radiation from the environment. Obviously, however, it is not just wine tasters that should be worried by this research. It stands to reason that, if these trees are adapting to deal with a changing climate, so too might be others that provide different foods and products.","Research led by University of Lisbon says quality of corks is decreasing .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In 1987 scientists at the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) at Cern were left baffled when their experiment to work out why and how protons 'spin' was unsuccessful. The conundrum became known as the ‘proton spin crisis’ and has continued to prove puzzling for 27 years, but now researchers think they have the answer. A study has shown that a subatomic particle known as a gluon may be responsible for giving the proton the majority of its spin, bringing to an end a decades-long puzzle. Researchers using a collider in New York say they have solved the 'spin' mystery of protons. Since an experiment in 1987 the origins of proton spin have been unknown. It had once been thought to be cause exclusively by three quarks (illustrated), but now scientists think gluons play an important role . Atoms are usually made of protons, neutrons and electrons . These are made of even smaller elementary particles. Elementary particles, also known as fundamental particles, are the smallest particles we know to exist. They are subdivided into two groups, the first being fermions, which are said to be the particles that make up matter. The second are bosons, the force particles that hold the others together. Within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks. When quarks combine in threes, they form compound particles known as baryons. Protons are probably the best-known baryons. Sometimes, . quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles (such as . anti-quarks), which have the same mass but opposite charges. When this happens, they form mesons. Mesons . often turn up in the decay of heavy man-made particles, such as those . in particle accelerators, nuclear reactors and cosmic rays. Mesons, baryons, and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons. The latest research was conducted by Dr Daniel de Florian from the University of Buenos Aires and colleagues using a collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. Previously it had been thought that the proton’s spin was caused exclusively by subatomic particles known as quarks. But the experiment in 1987 had showed that quarks failed to account for the entirety of the proton’s spin. Quarks are the subatomic particles that make up larger particles such as protons, while gluons are the ‘glue’ that holds them together. The term spin here is somewhat of a misnomer here, however. It does not describe the process of actual spinning, like a ball rotating, but it refers to what is basically ‘quantum spinning’, also called ‘nuclear spin’. Spin at a quantum level - the smallest you can possibly get - is defined as a physical constant that explains how particles have a magnetic field, interact and so on. How protons get this physical constant, however, was a mystery. Subatomic particles are said to have different values of spin - for example quarks have a spin of ½ in either a positive or negative direction. Protons have a spin of ½, which had led scientists to believe their spin could be accounted by two quarks of one orientation spin, and one the other. This, however, was not the case, with only a quarter of the proton’s spin coming from the quarks. ‘That was the naïve idea 25 years ago,’ Dr Daniel de Florian tells Scientific American. ‘By the end of the ‘80s it was possible to measure the contribution of the spin of the quarks to the spin of the proton, and the first measurement showed it was 0 percent. That was a very big surprise.’ Later measurements would show this contribution to be up to 25 per cent of the proton’s spin, leaving at least 75 per cent still accounted for. Quarks are elementary particles, the smallest particles we know to exist. When they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons. Quarks are said to have six ‘flavours’: Up, Down, Charm, Strange, Top and Bottom. Combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘larger’ particles. Groups of three quarks are known as baryons. An example of a baryon is a proton, which is made of two 'Up' quarks and a 'Down' quark. The latest research was conducted by Dr Daniel de Florian from the University of Buenos Aires and colleagues using a collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (top, center) is 2.4 miles (3.9 kilometres) in circumference, and dominates Brookhaven's 5,265-acre campus . The new research shows that gluons, which have a spin of 1, contribute as much as half of the proton’s spin. This was based on proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). When protons are smashed together their interaction is controlled by the strong force. This is determined by gluons, meaning they are intricately involved in the collisions of protons. The orientation of the protons’ spins was then used to determine that gluons must indeed have an effect on spin. More data is needed from collisions at lower momentum to confirm the result, but for now it looks like one of the great mysteries in subatomic physics might finally be solved. And doing so will enable scientists to better understand how particles get their mass. One of the other unsolved mysteries of subatomic physics is that of confinement - why quarks, gluons and so forth are only ever found within other subatomic particles like protons, and not by themselves. Solving this would help explain how quarks and gluons in turn get their own spin. This result could be an important factor in determining where proton mass comes from.","Researchers using a collider in New York say they have solved 'spin' mystery .

With various features users can alter their facial features to their heart’s content - and then share a video of their new appearance with others. Scroll down for video . New York-based Modiface has unveiled an app that changes your looks. Called Beauty Mirror (shown) it enables to alter your appearance on the go. The app has a number of filters and settings that can change your face. It can, for example, show you what you'd look like if you were thinner or had clearer skin . Through live 3D face tracking the app gives users the ability to apply customisable facial, skin and anti-aging effects to every angle of their face instantly as they look into the camera. The company claims its transformations are ‘seamless’ and designed to produce an improved image only noticeably edited to the user. ‘Beauty Mirror is designed to give users a very natural looking modified image through the addition of subtle effects, like skin clearing and slight weight loss,’ said Miriam Pettinen, director of partnerships and mobile strategy at Modiface. ‘We’re excited to bring an app to the marketplace that will not leave users looking very obviously edited, but instead just slightly more polished.’ While the app is free to download, unlocking all the features will cost £1.49 ($1.99). Instant 3D facial tracking and calibration takes less than a second to find and track your facial features. Photo-realistic 3D effects result then apply changes to your face in real-time with allow you to see a 'new you' as you look from side to side. Four pre-set looks and over 14 customisable effects such as weight loss and skin perfection can then be applied. You can then record, save and share your modified videos with a single touch. Through live simulation the app updates face location and pose every 0.03 seconds as up to 14 customisable effects are applied to the face while the user looks into the camera. Some of the effects include eye enlargement, facelift, skin clearing, acne reduction and weight loss. Users are able to take a picture of themselves at any point or record their transformation as a video, which is then saved directly to their device for sharing on social networks. In the coming months Beauty Mirror technology will also be integrated as filters that users will be able to apply while using video chatting programs. The technology will also be used by several anti-aging and skin-care brands for in-store product simulation. A number of settings (left) to retouch your face are included on the phone including cheek lift, face lift and slimming.

They are then randomly connected to a stranger around the world. The Home Office reminds people that smoking cannabis in the UK is illegal . Smoking cannabis even casually can damage core structures of the brain, an authoritative study has found. Just using the drug once or twice a week affects the  size and shape of two key  brain regions involved in emotion and motivation, the research shows. Previous studies have focused on heavy users of cannabis - revealing that the active compound in the drug effectively ‘rewires’ the brain. But this is the first study that has revealed the impact of casual marijuana use. The scientists, from Harvard Medical School and Northwestern University in Chicago, analysed MRI brain scans of 20 young cannabis users aged 18 to 25. They compared them to the brain scans 20 young people who never smoked the drug. Professor Hans Breiter, one of the researchers from Northwestern University said: ‘This study raises a strong challenge to the idea that casual marijuana use  is not associated with bad consequences.’ When users first log onto the website they are asked ‘How high are you?’ Once a number is selected, the user is then taken into a chat window with a random other user. While their name is anonymous, how high they are is revealed next to their name. Users can also use a webcam to have a video chat with others. 'Quite predictably, I was inspired to create PuffPuffChat whilst under the influence of marijuana,' the site's creator, Eric, told  MailOnline via email. 'So far the feedback has been very positive and heartwarming. 'Many people have reported having all kinds of fun conversations, some merely amusing, some truly inspiring. 'A surprising amount of favourable feedback, however, specifically refers to perhaps the silliest feature of the site - the see-through clouds at the top portion of the page.

Drug charities and the Home Office, however, have expressed concern at the site - especially considering cannabis is illegal in the UK and most parts of the U.S. - and warned users of the dangers of the drug. 'Based on evidence from across Europe, we know that stronger strains of cannabis may well be causing more problems,' a spokesperson for Public Health England told MailOnline. 'Our figures show that more and more people are using specialist drug services to get help for cannabis use, even though the overall trend is falling. 'This increase is likely to be due to a greater awareness of the risks and problems caused by cannabis by both people using the drug and health professionals referring people on to services.' A spokesperson for the Home Office added: 'Our position is clear: cannabis is controlled as a class B drug. Suggesting that people should be discouraged from smoking and using the site is an operational matter for the police.'","Website that lets people talk while high on marijuana has been launched .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . From an early age children are taught not to talk to strangers, but as adults should people be more chatty with people they don’t know? That’s the case according to two researchers at the University of Chicago, who say conversing with strangers can actually make people happier. In a study they found that when people were encouraged to talk with others on their commute they enjoyed their journey more, and vice versa for when they kept to themselves. Is a stranger just a friend you haven't met? Researchers from the University of Chicago asked commuters to socialise with people they didn't know for a small reward. They found that people who talked said that they enjoyed their trip more. However, people asked to predict the results thought the outcome would be opposite . 'I think our results simply tell us that people are missing opportunities for social engagement that would be more rewarding than one might expect,' he tells MailOnline. 'Modern urban life creates many situations where strangers in close proximity to each other. 'Engaging one of those people in a quick conversation could make each of those situations surprisingly more pleasant. 'These data suggest that if your goal is to be a little happier that you might otherwise be, or to turn an unpleasant situation (like a commute on public transportation or a dull period in a waiting room) into something more pleasant, then trying to get to know a fellow human being could be a useful strategy.' He also adds that although the research was done in the U.S. he sees no reason why the same conclusions cannot be applied to countries like the UK. The study was carried out by Dr Nicholas Epley and Ms Juliana Schroeder from the University of Chicago. In Homewood, Illinois they gathered 100 commuters and split them into three groups, reports Discover. One group was asked to talk to strangers, the next to stay silent and the third to act as normal, all in exchange for a complimentary $5 (£3) Starbucks gift card. After the commute the volunteers were asked to assess how much they enjoyed their journey. Those who had struck up a conversation with someone they didn’t know reported a more enjoyable commute. Those who had sat in solitude, meanwhile, reported a less pleasurable journey and were even said to be feeling less productive. Interestingly, the researchers also gathered another group of volunteers, but there were just asked to predict what they thought the results of the experiment would be, and not to take part themselves. They thought that those commuters who sat in silence would have a more enjoyable time, rather than those who spoke to others. Are people missing chances to be happier by keeping to themselves on their commute? 'Human beings are social animals,' say the researchers. 'Those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not, in at least some contexts, be social enough for their own well-being' The results of the study support other research into this area, namely that people can be stimulated by holding conversations with people they don’t know. And many also believe that attempts to start up a conversation will be met with ridicule, but that has been shown in this experiment not to be the case with the average conservation lasting 14 minutes. In their paper the researchers ask: ‘Connecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other. Why?’ They postulate that either ‘solitude is a more positive experience than interacting with strangers, or people misunderstand the consequences of distant social connections.’ But they conclude, according to their research, that it is the latter that is the case and not the former. ‘The pleasure of connection seems contagious,’ they continue. Indeed, in a separate experiment participants who were spoken to in a laboratory waiting room said they had a more positive experience than those who were sat alone. ‘Human beings are social animals,’ say the researchers. ‘Those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not, in at least some contexts, be social enough for their own well-being.’","Researchers from the University of Chicago asked commuters to socialise .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Good mothering really does boost a baby's brainpower, according to new research. Scientists found that a mother's presence can have a positive influence on the neuron generation of her children. And they hope to develop diagnostic tools and therapies for people whose brains may have been impaired or simply underdeveloped during infancy. Researchers from New York University studied mothering habits, and they found babies had better neuron generation when in their mother's presence (stock image shown), which can apparently regulate and control electrical signalling in a positive way that boosts brain development . In other infant news, scientists think that cooing at a newborn baby is a vital part of teaching them to speak. Exaggerated vowels that experts call ‘motherese’ - the ‘goos’ and ‘gaas’ that can be infuriating to non-parents - are a key part of the learning process, a study by the University of Washington suggests. Exposing infants to clear vocal sounds from birth helps them distinguish language from other noises, the researchers suggest. They found that babies aged seven months can differentiate voices from other sounds - even when they cannot see the person speaking. By the age of 11 months, before they can speak themselves, the children have already learned to differentiate their mother tongue from other languages, the scientists discovered. The study serves as evidence that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital for their development. And the authors say the long, clear vowels that parents babble at their newborns is a key part of the process. The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, are the first to show how such natural, early attachment behaviours including nesting, nursing and grooming impact key stages in postnatal brain development. 'Our research shows how in mammals the mother's sensory stimulation helps sculpt and mould the infant's growing brain and helps define the role played by ""nurturing"" in healthy brain development, and offers overall greater insight into what constitutes good mothering,' said Professor Regina Sullivan of New York University. 'The study also helps explain how differences in the way mothers nurture their young could account, in part, for the wide variation in infant behaviour among animals, including people, with similar backgrounds, or in uniform, tightly knit cultures.' In the study the researchers observed . new-born rats and found as they were protected, warmed and fed their . neurons grew and communicated better with each other. An . analysis of almost 100 hours of video and electrical readings from the . pups brains found maternal-infant bonding directly moulds early neural . activity. The study found the mother's presence in the nest regulated and controlled electrical signalling in the infant pup's brain. The 'slow wave', neural signalling patterns seen during the initial phases of mammalian brain development in rats aged between 12 and 20 days, closely resembled those seen in humans for meditation and sleep-wake cycles and during highly focused attention. This suggested that, when the rats were with their mother, their brains were undergoing periods of increased neuron generation. When their mother was not present, however, their brain activity was more erratic. Professor Sullivan's previous research in animals showed how maternal interactions influenced gene activity in the infant brain. And this latest study offers an even more profound perspective on maternal caregiving. 'There are so many factors that go into rearing children,' added co-author Dr Emma Sarro. 'Our . findings will help scientists and clinicians better understand the . whole brain implications of quality interactions and bonding between . mothers and infants so closely after birth, and how these biological . attachment behaviours frame the brain's hard wiring.' The study came to the conclusion by observing rats aged 12 to 20 days and studying over 100 hours of video. In the presence of their mother they had periods of increased neuron generation (shown), but brain activity became more erratic when they were separated .","Researchers from New York University studied mothering habits .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Former England spinner John Emburey has revealed that he has skin cancer and claims that years of playing cricket outdoors in the sun caused it to develop. The 61-year-old cricketer had surgery on Tuesday and arrived at Lord's in St John's Wood, London with a black eye and large stitches on his forehead. Emburey, a former England legend was at the grounds to see England players who were having a practice session for their upcoming one-day game against Sri Lanka. Bruised: John Emburey shakes hands with England's  Eoin Morgan at Lord's on Tuesday - the legend revealed he has skin cancer . He revealed that he has cancer and doctors had removed an area of skin. He told The Sun: 'It's the results of playing cricket for so many years not wearing a hat and not using suncream.' 'When I played there wasn't the same awareness of how much damage the sun can cause as there is now.' Legend: John Emburey (centre) is congratulated by his team mates during England's tour Of Pakistan in  1987 . As the most common type of skin cancer in Europe, the USA and Australia, Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are slow-growing epidermal skin tumours which are thought to arise from hair follicles. This type of cancer used to be most prevalent in elderly people, but it is now being seen in people under 40 years old. The sun-exposed areas of the head and neck are the most commonly involved areas where the cancer develops. It predominantly affects Caucasians and is very uncommon in dark-skinned races. While the skin over the top can remain intact for many months, it will eventually develop into an ulcer that doesn’t heal. But BCCs which are treated at an early stage are usually completely cured. However, some BCCs are aggressive, and if left to grow they may spread into the deeper layers of the skin and sometimes to the bones, making treatment difficult. He only became aware of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), four years ago - despite it being the most common form of skin cancer. It is not the most aggressive form of cancer and doctors told him that it can be eliminated through surgery and might not lead to scars. Cancer: John Emburey, right, discusses tactics with bowler Robert Croft - he claims players are now more aware of how much damage the sun can cause . But he joked: 'Looking at my face that's hard to believe! I look like Mike Gatting after he was hit by a Malcolm Marshall bouncer.' Emburey was a familiar face in English cricket having played 64 Tests between 1978 and 1995 for Middlesex, Northamptonshire, Western Province, Berkshire and England. He was a right arm spin bowler and a slightly eccentric but useful lower-order batsman who was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1984.","The 61-year-old cricket legend had surgery on .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . An elephant’s trunk is not only long, it is packed with five times more smell receptors than humans. And now research has found that the African elephants have the greatest sense of smell among mammals - even beating dogs including the bloodhound renowned for its sniffing ability. Humans were found to have the worst sense of smell across the species studied. Researchers studied genes of 13 mammals. It found African elephants (pictured) have the greatest sense of smell, while humans were found to have the worst. According to the researchers, the African elephant can detect water from miles away and use their olfactory ability to detect predators at a distance . According to the researchers, the African elephant can detect water from miles away and use their olfactory ability to detect predators at a distance, find food or a mate. The study, published in the journal Genome Research, examined the olfactory receptor (OR) range in 13 mammalian species. They found the African elephant has the largest number of OR genes ever characterised. To . characterise the olfactory capabilities of different mammals, . researchers examined genome sequences from 13 placental mammals and . identified over 10,000 OR genes in total. The repertoire of OR genes found in any given species was highly unique - only three OR genes were shared and evolutionarily conserved amongst all 13 mammals. Yet, the African elephant had the most extensive olfactory repertoire, with almost 2,000 OR genes. The study, published in the journal Genome Research, examined the olfactory receptor (OR) range in 13 mammalian species. These included horses, rabbits, guinea pigs, cows, rodents and chimpanzees.

Yet, the African elephant had the most extensive olfactory repertoire, with almost 2,000 OR genes. Dr Yoshihito Niimura of Tokyo Medical and Dental University said: ‘The functions of these genes are not well known, but they are likely important for the living environment of African elephants. ‘Apparently, an elephant’s nose is not only long but also superior.’ By contrast humans, along with our primate relatives, have much fewer numbers of OR genes compared to all other species examined, possibly because we rely less on smell as our sight improved. To characterise the olfactory capabilities of different mammals, researchers examined genome sequences. The repertoire of OR genes found in any given species was unique - only three OR genes were shared among all 13 mammals. Yet, the African elephant (pictured) had the most extensive range, with almost 2,000 . The authors traced the evolutionary histories of OR genes using a novel computational tool to deduce ancestral genes, and then examined their duplication or loss in each species. Some lineages of OR genes have greatly expanded in a given species, such as an ancestral gene that has duplicated in elephants. This generated 84 distinct genes - humans and other primates only have one copy - while other OR gene lineages are completely lost. Each species’ unique olfactory repertoire, resulting from hundreds of gene duplications and deletions during evolution, highlighted the molecular basis for differences in olfaction across organisms. Dr Niimura said: ‘Comparison of the repertoires of OR genes among mammals lets us know the commonalities and differences of olfactory perception, deepening our understanding of the sense of smell in humans.’","Researchers studied 13 mammals including elephants and humans .

"By . Scarlett Russell . When young people are taken into care, the hope is that they will be protected by the system. Sadly, we already know there are children who are catastrophically failed by this safety net, ending up in even more toxic situations than the ones they were plucked from. For Marni Mulholland, from London, a life in care was far from a safe haven. Victim: Marni Mulholland (not her real name), pictured here, is now 42. She is sharing the story of how she was raped and groomed into prostitution, in the hope that is will raise awareness . When she was sent to a children’s home, she claims she was routinely abused and raped by a man everyone else trusted - a social worker. After years of sexual abuse at the hands of Matthew [all names have been changed to protect identities], Marni eventually . turned to prostitution in her late teens. Now, 20 years on, she has . decided to come forward about her past in an honest - and at times . distressing - memoir, in the hope of raising awareness about child . grooming. ‘I started a diary about what happened a couple of years ago, and that eventually turned into the book,’ Marni tells MailOnline. ‘Leading a quiet life would be far less painful but I feel compelled to talk about this. It’s still very hard for me because it is still very much on the surface. ‘But I want to lift the lid about child grooming and the abuse I suffered in the children’s home.' Marni grew up on a tough council estate in West London, where she says she was victimised by other girls. By the . time she was 14, her mother had suffered several mental episodes (she . was later diagnosed with schizophrenia) and was unable to look after her, so Marni was sent to a . children’s home. BX1RG6 Child abduction . The home was meant to be a safe place for the young girl. And . at first it was. But then a social worker in his 30s began plying her . with gifts and showering her with attention, gaining Marni’s trust, a . tactic she now refers to as ‘slow-burning grooming.’ Within months Marni had formed a strong . attachment to Matthew and consented to having sex with him. At the . time, she saw nothing wrong with their 20-year age gap and the fact she . was just 14. ‘Matthew and the other social workers worked in shifts, often staying the night,’ Marni explains. ‘I . don’t think anyone had any idea what was going on. I didn’t tell them . because I was ashamed and I didn’t think I’d be believed anyway. I don’t . think they had any inkling at all.’ Courage: Marni says talking about her horrific past is difficult, but if she can help just one girl who is being abused, then it will make her happy . Marni says their sexual relationship continued for years. They would have sex in Matthew’s office, his home, in public toilets and at the children’s home. All the while, Matthew gave Marni presents and cash in return for her body. Marni was re-housed and given her own council flat at the age of 18. She went to art college, but by this point, she had already begun prostituting herself. She describes in the book how sex for money felt normal for her, even though she knew on some level that it was very wrong. ‘I was so ashamed so never told anyone or made friends,’ she says. ‘I’ve been ashamed all my life. It’s only very recently I’ve been able to talk about it.’ However, by the time she was ‘19 or 20,' Marni started to realise that the life she was living was far from normal. ‘I was having very dysfunctional relationships, I was promiscuous,’ she says. ‘I realised my problem was Matthew. And I realised it was wrong. ‘When . you’re an adult you realise that isn’t right. I was older and wiser. One day, when I was around 19 or 20, I found the courage to . go into the police and tell them about it but it took a long time to get . to that stage.’ Raw is out now, £6.99 by Ebury Press . She made her complaint in 1990, when she was and the process dragged on for 'around' three years, according to Marni, who has difficulty remembering specific dates. Marni eventually decided to withdraw her complaint in 1993 as reliving her past proved too painful. ‘It’s very hard to sit there and relive your experiences to a complete stranger,’ she says. ‘You have to remember the day, the week, the weather. It’s so difficult and you can see why often court cases collapse. 'You see why the victim is so frustrated. It’s like being abused all over again. People who come forward now are very brave. Marni's allegations against Matthew were never heard in court, and he was never convicted. At around that time, she was moving in moneyed circles in Chelsea and Sloane Square, still a prostitute and taking drugs and drinking heavily. It wasn't until she met Josh, now her husband, in 2001, that she was able to break her unhealthy patterns of behaviour. She credits Josh for helping her rebuild her life. ‘When I told him about my past he was very understanding,’ she says. ‘He’s very strong and grounded. ‘He says he loves me for what I am, tells me that my past isn’t my fault and he gives me a lot of strength. ‘If I saw Matthew now I’d think he was a sad old man. I see him as weak. I have the strength and power now and I wouldn’t be afraid of him, I don’t live in fear anymore because I think he’s pathetic. ‘It took time to build my life up. It’s like an invisible tattoo or a scar – it never heals. But time helps. My life now is happy. I’m in a very good place. I have a loving family and a network of supportive, understanding friends.’ Marni married Josh in 2002, and their first child, a daughter, was born the same year. In 2005, they had a son and, in 2007, left London for the west of England, where the family still lives. Now Marni wants to share her story so she can help other girls who are being abused and groomed. ‘I want to shout from the rooftops how terrible grooming is and how damaging it can be,’ she says. ‘It’s calculated and slow-burning and evil and it can muck up your whole life if you let it. If there is just one 14-year-old out there that I can help, I will be happy. ‘Being abused never goes away, you just find a way to cope with it,’ she says. ‘It’s always there, but I won’t let him win. I’m strong now.’ Raw by Marni Mulholland is published in paperback by Ebury Press, £6.99.  All names have been changed for legal reasons and to protect identities .","Marni Mulholland, 42, opens up about the horrific abuse she suffered at 14 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Our brains are hardwired to recognise faces, even in inanimate objects, but researchers wanted to reveal how we can become virtually unrecognisable simply by tweaking our features. Chicago-based Robert Woodley and Adelheid Mers used software to identify 60 facial dimensions before plotting them across more than 1,000 photos donated by people across the globe. From the range of images, the team constructed an average face, and then used the dimensions to create what they call an 'Anti Face' for each contributor. Try out the module below . Developers Robert Woodley and Adelheid Mers used software to identify 60 facial dimensions, which were plotted across more than 1,000 photos donated by people from across the globe. For each photo, the team constructed an average face (pictured), before using the dimensions to create what they call an Anti Face . The Anti Face is the exact opposite of the face being studied, in terms of shape, size and individual features, said the researchers. Eigenfaces analysis is a statistical face recognition technique.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Buried on the site of a Roman fort in County Durham, archaeologists have made a series of well-preserved and extraordinary finds. The discoveries at Binchester Roman Fort near Bishop Auckland date back 1,800 years and include a silver ring - said to be one of the earliest pieces of evidence for Christianity in Roman Britain. Archaeologists also discovered a bath house with seven-foot high walls, once covered with brightly-painted designs and have dubbed the region 'Pompeii of the north.' Buried on the site of a Roman fort in County Durham, archaeologists have made a series of well-preserved and extraordinary finds. The discoveries date back 1,800 years and include one of the earliest pieces of evidence for Christianity in Roman Britain in the shape of a silver ring (pictured) The many finds at the site include this small carnelian intaglio, which is thought to have been worn as jewellery . The finds, including this bronze bangle, give an insight into the jewellery worn by early Roman settlers to Britain . The bath house was also found with the original floor, doorways and window openings. Elsewhere on the site, an inscribed altar dedicated to the Roman Goddess Fortune the Home-bringer, was unearthed. Lower and middle class Romans living in Pompeii feasted on exotic meats and spicy seafood in times before the city was struck by a devastating volcanic eruption in 79AD. Archaeologists recently disproved popular preconceptions that the rich dined on imported delicacies including flamingo, while the poor survived on gruel, by revealing that all classes of people enjoyed a rich and varied diet. The researchers discovered sea urchin and the butchered leg of a giraffe among less exotic foods like grain and eggs, in a poorer area of the ruined city. ‘These findings are hugely significant as they are virtually intact and present a graphic illustration of life under the Roman Empire,' said Dr David Mason, principal archaeologist for Durham County Council. ‘They are so stunning and spectacular that we can claim we have our very own ""Pompeii of the North"" right on our doorstep.’ A joint project to explore the site between the county council, Durham University, local enthusiasts and American university students, is now in its sixth year. Archaeologists also discovered a bath house (pictured) with seven-foot high walls, once covered with brightly-painted designs. The experts have dubbed the finds the 'Pompeii of the north.' The bath house was found with the original floor, doorways and window openings . The discoveries were made at the site of Binchester Roman Fort near Bishop Auckland in County Durham (marked). Binchester, which stands near the River Wear, was known to the Romans as Vinovia and commanded the main road that ran from the legionary headquarters at York north to Hadrian's Wall . Symbol of Christianity? The silver ring is inset with an intaglio, a carving into a flat surface. It appears to show two fish suspended from an anchor, at the time a symbol of Christianity. Archaeologists believe the ring is from the 3rd century AD. If it is a Christian symbol, it would the oldest Christian object in Britain, where the religion was not believed to be widespread until it was declared the official religion of the Roman Empire by Constantine, a century later. This ornate  coin is one of many found at the site and shows the technology the Romans brought to Britain . This piece of ceramics contains the image of a face and is thought to date back later than the 4th century AD . Binchester, which stands near the River Wear in the north of England, was known to the Romans as Vinovia. It commanded the main road that ran from the legionary headquarters at York north to Hadrian’s Wall. Historians claim it was a key element of the complex frontier system that lay both sides . of the Wall which marked the northern-most edge of the Roman Empire for . nearly 400 years. The fort itself was built in the second half of the first century AD, when the Romans were establishing its power in the North East. Originally, Romans used wood to build the structure, and later rebuilt it in stone when they believed it would become a permanent base. Romans from all over the world used the fort. For instance, historians believe a cavalry unit from Spain used it in the 2nd century AD. A separate group made up of Dutch tribesmen used the fort in the 3rd century AD. The latest find provides an unparalleled opportunity to better understand life on the northern frontier in the Roman period. For example, the altar is a reminder . that bath houses were about more than keeping clean and exercising and . were actually social centres - a bit like our modern day leisure centres. Among other things, the Roman Empire began the practice of taking a census of all the people within its boundaries every so often. The site  also reveals their expertise in straight roads, central heating and concrete. Sites such as Binchester were a proving ground for aspiring politicians and a powerbase for usurping emperors. Last year Alex Kirton, 20, from . Hertfordshire, discovered a carved sandstone head at Binchester, which . was believed to be a Roman god that was worshipped . locally. Project coordinator, Dr David Petts, lecturer in archaeology at Durham University, said: ‘Our excavations have uncovered parts of one of the best preserved Roman buildings in Britain. ‘The building itself and the wonderful array of artefacts we have recovered from Binchester give us an unparalleled opportunity to better understand life on the northern frontier in the Roman period. ‘For example, the altar is a reminder that bath houses were about more than keeping clean and exercising and were actually social centres - a bit like our modern day leisure centres. ‘The most unique feature of these remains is the sheer scale of their preservation. ‘It is possible to walk through a series of Roman rooms with walls all above head height; this is pretty exceptional for Roman Britain.’ The altar was inscribed by a retired trooper who served with a unit of the Spanish cavalry based at Binchester. The . trooper described his rank as ‘architectus’ and this is the only . example, outside of Rome, which shows architects were on the staff of . auxiliary cavalry units and not just the legions of the Emperor’s . personal protection unit, the Praetorian Guard. Binchester, . which stands near the River Wear, was known to the Romans as Vinovia . and commanded the main road that ran from the legionary headquarters at . York north to Hadrian’s Wall. It . formed a key element of the complex frontier system that lay both sides . of the Wall which marked the northern-most edge of the Roman Empire for . nearly 400 years. Elsewhere on the site, an inscribed altar (pictured left) dedicated to the Roman Goddess Fortune the Home-bringer (illustration pictured right), was also unearthed. The altar has been inscribed by a retired trooper who served with a unit of the Spanish cavalry based at Binchester who described his rank as 'architectus' This stone fragment from the fort still bares the paint used to decorate the walls of rooms inside the building . This image shows the bath house from above. The altar found on the site reveals that bath houses were about more than keeping clean and exercising, and were actually social centres - a bit like modern-day leisure centres . Archaeologists have also found a number of items made out of bronze, copper and bone, such as this pin . The findings are so preserved and significant, principal archaeologist Dr David Mason said: '[They] present a graphic illustration of life under the Roman Empire. They are so stunning we can claim we have our very own ""Pompeii of the north"" right on our doorstep.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Snapchat is the latest tool being used by police officers to catch criminals across the Midlands. West Midlands Police is the first force in the world to use the self-destructing messaging app to post community details, and appeals from departments including the cannabis Disposal Team and the Dogs Unit. All the chats will be posted using the app's Stories feature, where they last for 24 hours rather than self-destructing after being read. West Midlands Police has joined Snapchat under the username WestMidsPolice (pictured). The account will be used to inform residents of campaigns in areas including Walsall, Coventry and Wolverhampton. Departments including the cannabis Disposal Team, neighbourhood officers and the Dogs Unit will use the service . The force already uses Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr and Instagram to connect with the community, which includes Wallsall, Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Snapchat announced the Stories feature last October to its Android and iOS users. It lets users add Snaps together to create a narrative. When a Snap is added to a story, it is live for 24 hours before automatically disappearing. This differs from regular Snaps that self-destruct after they're read, depending on what timeframe the user has chosen. Privacy options can also be set for Snapchat Stories, which include Public or Friends. Snapchat will be used in a similar way, and the force will post images and videos about events in the local area, campaigns its running, or to appeal for information about incidents and crime. The force is using the app under the username WestMidsPolice, and said it will be sharing a number of images every day. ‘Part of this work is about connecting with younger people and helping them to feel they have a close connection with their local police force,' said Keiley Gartland, from the corporate communications department at the site. 'What we want is for them to have the confidence to give us a call or speak to their neighbourhood bobby when they really need our help - and social media is a great tool for us to do that.

'We can share crucial updates on incidents and crime prevention tips whilst also offering a unique insight into our work.’ The pictures will come from across departments that make up WMP such as the cannabis Disposal Team, Traffic Unit, CID, neighbourhood officers and the Dogs Unit. Keiley added: ‘We’re primarily targeting a younger audience on Snapchat and it means when we really need to get an important message out to the community, we’ll have a captive audience.' Officers of all ranks, from PC to Deputy Chief Constable, as well as police staff and special constables, now have a presence on social networking sites and earlier this year, the force’s Twitter account reached 100,000 followers.

The results were taken from the Technonomic Index, commissioned by the European Samsung Lifestyle Research Lab in partnership with Ipsos MORI. Ipsos MORI interviewed 5,000 adults aged between 18 and 65 from 14 to 28 April. The research also focused specifically on the UK for a selection of questions. Following these online interviews, the study found that the average UK household has 19 technological devices - against an European average of 18.

In addition, the popularity of streaming and download TV services such as Netflix continues to rise with 60 per cent of British adults claiming to have streamed TV and film services. And 62 per cent of these respondents stated they use these services at least once a week. A further one in ten households said they have four mobiles per home, and one in ten households have more than four TVs. Tablet ownership is also popular, according to the study, with 38 per cent of British households now having one tablet device. More than one in five (22 per cent) admitted that their reason for buying a tablet was to treat themselves. According to figures from another recent study, the average viewer spends six hours 50 minutes a day switching between a smartphone, a tablet, TV or a PC monitor. And across the 30 countries surveyed, Indonesians topped the chart with a staggering nine hours of daily screen time. At the other end of the screen-time scale, Italians spend just five hours 17 minutes looking at their gadgets each day.","The Spanish use gadgets and appliances 8 hours 48 minutes a day .

It also reported that component makers are similarly reducing the thickness of panels and chassis for the upcoming handset. Concept from Italian-firm SET Solution is pictured . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). However, this is said to be causing production problems because of the fragile nature of such components. Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One. A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which is expected to be the smaller handset. In April, Taiwan-based Commercial Times similarly referenced a 2mm-thick battery.

It would follow the release of Apple’s super-thin iPad Air last year, which, at 0.2-inches (7.5mm) thick, is 2mm thinner than the iPad 4’s 0.4-inch (9.4mm) depth. Two concept images released earlier this year depicted Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. The first concept predicted the phone will be 4.5mm thick. While the second went a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.2 inches (7.6mm). The iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, the second concept suggested doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys. Sources also told Aaron Lee at Digitimes that rival Samsung has similarly created a thin battery, at just 0.06 inches (1.65mm) thick, but hasn’t added it to any products yet.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Behind the numerous benefits of self-driving cars, being touted by Google and other manufacturers, an imminent danger is lurking. The technology could see criminals using the cars in high-speed chases, for example, or to shoot out of the window while the car drives itself. In fact, the FBI is so concerned about the threats they pose, the agency has dubbed them ‘potential leathal weapons’ in a recent report. Scroll down for video . Files detail the FBI's concerns about self-driving vehicles, (Google's autonomous car pictured). The report said: 'Autonomy...will open up ways for a car to be more of a potential lethal weapon than it is today.' For example, criminals could shoot out of the window while the car drives itself . The files were obtained by Mark Harris at The Guardian. Google began by installing its self-driving technology to cars including the Toyota Prius and Lexus RX450h in 2012. In May, the tech giant unveiled its own 25mph self-driving car, with a smiley face. Tesla Boss Elon Musk has also announced plans to launch a range of autonomous cars by 2016. Autonomous vehicles extend beyond cars, however, and also include the self-driving military trucks recently tested in Texas. The . demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive . Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed . Martin in Maryland. Called . the Unmanned Mission Module, the technology used in the trucks and . Google’s cars included a high performance LIDAR sensor - or laser radar. They were revealed during a public records request, and detail the FBI’s concerns about autonomous vehicles. It said: 'Autonomy…will make mobility more efficient, but will also open up greater possibilities for dual-use applications and ways for a car to be more of a potential lethal weapon than it is today.’ The technology is currently only legal in four states, including Nevada, Florida, California and Michigan, while European Union laws currently call for drivers to control their cars at all times. But Europe, Germany, Netherlands and Spain have allowed testing robotic cars in traffic, and Finland is planning on passing a law before next year. These concerns extend beyond Google’s smart cars, too. Autonomous vehicles referenced in the report also include the self-driving military trucks recently tested in Texas. The demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed Martin in Maryland. Each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections, oncoming traffic, stalled and passing vehicles, pedestrians and traffic circles in both urban and rural test areas. The technology includes a high performance LIDAR sensor, or laser radar. This remote sensing technology is capable of scanning the road ahead (pictured) and measuring distances by illuminating a target with a laser, and analysing the light reflected. The technology is also fitted with a GPS receiver to plan, and track routes .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Sci-fi fans can boldly go beyond ordinary TV remote controls with their own replica of the Star Trek phaser. Built using access to the original weapon first used nearly 50 years ago in the original series, the gadget can store up to 36 channel changing commands, and makes 10 authentic phaser firing sounds. It was created by The Wand Company after the Cambridge firm got exclusive access to the last remaining prop from the TV show. Scroll down for video . The replica phaser (pictured) was built by The Wand Company and goes on sale in November. Phasers are fictional weapons that have been used by Starfleet personnel since the original series of the TV show. The gadget can store up to 36 remote control commands and makes 10 phaser firing sounds . To build the replica, engineers used a laser to create 3D scans of the device. These scans were then turned into the finished model. The phaser has been the standard weapon used by Star Trek’s Starfleet personnel since the original series began in 1966. The . fictional weapons often resemble a handheld gun or pistol, but use a directed energy beam to target enemies, rather than bullets. Most are classed as particle weapons that fire particle beams. Larger . phaser ‘rifles’ have also appeared in Star Trek over the years, and . ‘phaser arrays’ are mounted on starships, such as the USS Enterprise, to . defend against attacks from enemy ships. According to the show, phasers were invented during the 23rd century and used by Starfleet from 2233. Phaser rifles were used as early as 2265, alongside laser pistols, and can be set to stun or kill. It also comes with tactile force-feedback, a customisable personal lock code, and is sold in a foam-lined presentation case. And, because it uses infra-red, it can control almost all home entertainment systems and many other infra-red controlled devices. Chris Barnardo, co-founder of The Wand Company, said: ‘The Star Trek Phaser is one of the most iconic pieces of sci-fi gadgetry. ‘We were privileged to get access to this amazing prop and be the first to 3D laser scan it. ‘We have spent thousands of hours creating a detailed collectible that will bring new levels of action and enjoyment to Star Trek fans all over the world.’ The phaser has been the standard weapon used by Star Trek’s Starfleet personnel since the original series began in 1966.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A survey revealed 57% of adults wish they could live in another time. One in five said they'd rather live in the 1960s (model Twiggy pictured in 1967) Despite the current advancements in medicine, technology and transport, almost 60 per cent of British people would rather live in any other era than the current one. And when asked which decade they'd prefer to live in, one in five voted for the 1960s. The decade was also voted as one of the most prosperous in the whole of human history, beating the entire 19th century, and the Roaring Twenties. Unsurprisingly, the darkest period of history was voted as the Black Death, which killed up to an estimated 200 million people during the 14th century. The findings were revealed as part of the Yesterday Historical Report commissioned to mark the launch of show Inquisition on the TV channel, Yesterday. The 1960s were seen as great because of the widespread revolution and change in politics, music and society around the world. A total of 57 per cent of people said they wish they didn’t live in the current day. Behind the 1960s was Ancient Rome in second place at 9.9 per cent. A further 9.8 per cent said that rock and roll from the 1950s had the biggest draw, while 9.2 per cent also revealed they wanted to experience the roaring 1920s, and 3.2 per cent longed for the 1930s. Results were taken from a survey of more than 2,000 British adults, with support from historian Richard Felix. The 1960s were also voted as one of the most prosperous in human history. The decade was seen as great because of the widespread revolution and change in politics, music and society around the world. The Beatles in 1964 pictured, from left to right is John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison and Ringo Starr . The findings shine a spotlight on the darkest and the most prosperous periods of human history, as well as the top inventions and discoveries. Although the 1960s was the most recent . period to make the prosperous list, the Roman period, between 27 BC to . 476 AD, was voted top. This was because the Roman army put an end to small wars, allowing people to farm and trade in peace. Results were taken from a survey of 2,000 adults. The Roman period, between 27BC to 476 AD, was voted the most prosperous. This was because the Roman army (reconstruction pictured) put an end to small wars, allowing people to farm and trade in peace. They also introduced town planning, baths, toilets and fresh water . The darkest period of history was voted as the Black Death, which killed up to an estimated 200 million people during the 14th century (illustration pictured left). It received half of the votes. Tudor England, between 1485 and 1603, including Henry VIII (illustration pictured right) received 19.7 per cent of the votes . They also introduced town planning, baths, drains, toilets and fresh water supplies. Behind the Black Death, which sat the top of the darkest period list with more than half the votes, was the Inquisitions of the 12th Century to the 18th Century. During this time, thousands of people were arrested, tried and executed for heresy by the Roman Catholic Church. Torture methods such as water boarding, castration and beatings were used to extract confessions. TOP 10 DARKEST PERIODS IN HISTORY . 1. Black Death (14th Century) - 50.8 per cent .

It resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, making it the deadliest in human history. 4. World War 1 (1914 - 1918) - 41.6 per cent . More than nine million combatants were killed; a casualty rate exacerbated by the advances in technology. 5.  Dark Ages (500 - 1000 AD) - 38.9 per cent . This was a period of great upheaval, constant war, horrendous plague, and stagnant cultural growth, due to the invasions of barbarians. It is estimated 100 million people died due to war, plague or hunger. 6. The Roman Empire (27 BC - 476 AD) - 32.6 per cent . The Romans punished and whipped slaves. Roman Emperors were known for being brutal in their enforcement of their religious views. 7. The Witch Craze (15th Century – 18th Century) - 31.8 per cent . During this period, society was consumed by a panic over alleged witches. Witch-hunts resulted in the trial, torture, and execution of tens of thousands of victims, about three-quarters of whom were women. 8. Tudor England (1485 - 1603) - 19.7 per cent . Henry VIII, Queen Mary and Elizabeth I between them arrested thousands of people to face the threat of trial and execution.

In this period, new machines were invented and installed, including large mills and factories. New towns sprang up around the mills offering cheap housing, schooling and medical care. 3. The Greeks (384 BC) - 29.4 per cent . They adopted a scientific approach to life, with Aristotle being the founder of Western science. Greek mathematicians produced rules of maths and geometry, which produced town planning and well-proportioned buildings. 4. The 1960s- 27.1 per cent . This was a decade of revolution and change in politics, music and society around the world. It started in the US and the UK and spread to continental Europe. 5. Current day - 26.8 per cent .

The First World War had ended in victory for the Allies, peace had returned, and with it, prosperity. 10.  World War 1I (1939 – 1945) - 5.4 per cent . Although this is the deadliest conflict in history, it united people around the UK. Community spirit within Great Britain was at its highest. The Second World War was voted just ahead of the First, with 42 per cent of the votes compared to 41.6 per cent. The former resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, while the latter saw nine million deaths, exacerbated by the advances in technology. Although the Roman period was seen as most prosperous, it also featured among the darkest periods because the Romans punished and whipped slaves, and enjoyed watching gladiators fight to the death. The Second World War (former German leader Adolf Hitler is pictured) was voted just ahead of the First, in the darkest period of history list - with 42 per cent of the votes compared to 41.6 per cent . Among the top inventions in human history, electricity (stock image pictured left) was top with 60 per cent of the votes, followed by Alexander Fleming's penicillin (pictured right) on 44 per cent . 1. Electricity - 60.0 per cent . 2. Penicillin - 44.1 per cent . 3. The wheel - 39.1 per cent . 4. Internet - 37.4 per cent . 5. Computer - 35.3 per cent . 6. Printing press - 34.7 per cent . 7.

Emperors were also known for being brutal in their enforcement of their religious views. Among the top 20 inventions, electricity was top with 60 per cent of the votes, followed by Alexander Fleming's penicillin on 44 per cent. Surprisingly, both beat the wheel, which received 39 per cent of the votes, and is often credited as the best invention in human history. All three were also ahead of the internet, computers, and the printing press. Sanitation systems sat in seventh place, followed by the car, steam engine, and airplanes. Richard Felix said: ‘It is no surprise the Black Death came out on top in this study; the symptoms included painful blisters, acute fever, vomiting of blood and eventually death. ‘Similarly The Inquisition was a very bloody chapter of European history.’ Adrian Wills, General Manager of Yesterday added: ‘The report shows us the darkest and most gruesome periods of human history should not be forgotten.’ Inquisition is new and exclusive on Yesterday, Wednesdays at 9pm from 16 July.","Survey reveals six in ten adults wish they could live in another era .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The MotoGlo Light (pictured) can be fitted to any current helmet and features LEDs that glow depending on whether the rider is braking or turning . As a motorcyclist weaves through traffic, it can be easy to miss their bike’s brake lights and indicators tucked below a car driver’s view. To help make such riders more visible, an Arkansas firm has created the ultimate safety helmet accessory. The MotoGlo Light can be fitted to any current helmet and features LEDs that glow depending on whether the rider is braking or turning. It was created by electronics firm Whistler Group. The receiver attaches to any three-quarter, or full-face helmet to increase rider visibility while on the road. Sensors built into the device can detect when a bike is slowing down, or changing direction. The LEDs will then glow across the device to indicate the rider is braking, or only light up on the side the bike is turning. It is battery-powered and runs for 12 hours on a single charge. It can also be recharged in under an hour using a USB cable. ‘The MotoGlo is literally head and shoulders above traditional motorcycle lighting. ‘The increased rider visibility to following drivers improves everyone’s safety,’ said Steve Sanders, Product Development Manager at Whistler. The helmet is battery-powered and runs for 12 hours on a single charge. It can also be recharged in under an hour using a USB cable.

"By . Geoffrey Levy . As BBC cultural icons go, Dave Lee Travis was one of the biggest, and certainly the loudest. His DJ contemporary Jimmy Savile looked and sounded like the deceitful, dangerous weasel that he was. Dave Lee Travis, on the other hand, was the big, genial, self-proclaimed ‘Hairy Monster’, a huge personality who in his 1970s and 1980s heyday made millions of loyal female fans feel that he was the kind of man they would turn to in a crisis. Dave Lee Travis was the self-proclaimed 'Hairy Monster', a huge personality who, in the 1970s and 1980s made millions of female fans. He is pictured here in 2006 with Janice Long and paedophile Jimmy Savile . Perhaps even the sort of crisis when a woman realises the attentions of a man have become predatory, and she could do with some help. None of these fans would have believed then that decades later he would be charged with being one of those predators, surely not DLT who liked to say, ‘Everyone treats me as a friend in the home’. DLT was one of those BBC superstars – and in his day there were many – who attracted young girls like iron filings to a magnet. His wife Marianne accepted that he was a flirt, that his style was tactile. For decades as a Radio 1 institution, and on the television, the bushy-bearded DJ was cheery, loud, and zany. For his early-morning show he adapted his nickname to the ‘Hairy Cornflake’. What other DJ would have introduced the puzzling concept of snooker and darts competitions on a radio show? He was always publicly opinionated on his shows, and continued to be so. In recent years, after the Savile scandal led to celebrity arrests, he demanded indignantly: ‘Why can’t we list the names and addresses of all the paedophiles they’ve got?’ DJ Travis and his wife Marianne leaving Southwark Crown Court after being found not guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault . Dave Lee Travis carrying his wife Marianne on their wedding day in 1971 . When they were both BBC DJs, Travis, now 68, would sometimes join Savile at parties. He admitted he knew of Savile’s reputation with young girls. By young, he added, he meant girls who were 16, 17 or 18. But he told the police after he himself was arrested: ‘If I knew at that time that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile I would be the first one to get him arrested because it’s the worst crime in the world as far as I’m concerned.’ One of his accusers, now a mother of two, who alleged he assaulted her in an empty studio when she was 17, told the jury: ‘These DJs were big, big stars. They were like pop stars. There would be crowds of people hanging around outside the building to see them. They were like demi-gods.’ No one has suffered heavier blows since DLT was arrested in November 2012 than his blonde Swedish wife, Marianne, whom he married 43 years ago. She is a small and rather quiet woman described by acquaintances as ‘very sweet and very patient’, and there she was yesterday – as her husband was told he was free to go after almost a month in the dock – calmly brushing a speck of dust from the lapel of his jacket. One of Travis's accusers said he and other DJs of the era were 'big, big stars'. She told the jury: 'They were like demi-gods' Travis's wife Marianne has been described by acquaintances as being 'very sweet and very patient' Marianne has had breast cancer, from which she is recovering. And she has lost the lovely rambling £1.8 million Buckinghamshire farmhouse where they lived for many years – it had to be sold to pay for her husband’s legal defence. Home is now a modest cottage into which they moved before the trial began. Selling the house meant removing Dave Lee Travis’s large, semi-nude photographs of women on the walls of the kitchen, as well as the sculpture of the lower half of a woman wearing just a thong that stood by the fridge. It meant dismantling the unique library that Travis – ‘a permanent adolescent’ according to one friend – kept in the downstairs loo. The books were all about flatulence. Unlike the family of William Roache, who was acquitted of sexual charges last week, childless Marianne had kept away from the trial until Monday, when the jury retired to consider its verdicts. ‘Marianne has a rare tolerance,’ says a family friend, ‘never seeming to be bothered by his inveterate flirting with young women. ‘She was cool about his fame when he became a bigger star than he had ever thought possible on Top of the Pops and Radio 1. ‘And when his career was on the wane, she persuaded him to accept it with grace, saying that he’d had a good innings. I would say Dave is a very lucky man where Marianne is concerned.’ Marianne even sometimes assisted his lifelong hobby of photography. Those huge photographs in the kitchen were his work. His subjects, he explained in court, could be a girl he spotted in the pub or walking in the street. He said he would hand them a card so that they could contact him later to arrange a shoot, but only after they had asked their parents’ permission. He has taken lots of photographs of woman naked and semi-naked, but insisted they were not ‘tacky’. He once persuaded a woman to get her clothes off for a nude shoot after meeting her in the park and telling her he was impressed by a large tattoo on her back. ‘Women just have such fabulous shapes and I wanted to utilise those shapes,’ he declared. Did Marianne really approve of the photography? ‘It’s fine,’ she told a visiting interviewer. ‘Only fine?’ interjected Travis during the interview. ‘It’s great,’ said Marianne, correcting herself ‘ . . . I don’t know what you want me to say.’ ‘The secret of a happy marriage,’ Travis told the interviewer, grinning and putting both hands on her knee in full view of his wife, ‘is never look at another women or touch her knees! That’s the secret of a happy marriage.’ Was he always that flirty, the interviewer asked Marianne. ‘Oh, yes,’ came the reply. One has to wonder how different things would have been if DLT had remained plain David Patrick  Griffin, born in Buxton, Derbyshire, the son of a stage manager; and if he had stuck to his first job of graphic designer and not felt the pull of the nightlife and excitement of being a DJ. Once the boy from Manchester Grammar School – then a direct grant grammar but  now one of our leading private schools – realised it was what he wanted, there was no stopping him. The couple's former home near Leighton Buzzard. They have sold the £1.8million farmhouse to pay for Lee Travis's defence . Home is now a small bungalow in Buckinghamshire, a sharp contrast to the sprawling farmhouse the couple had to give up to pay Travis's legal fees . From part time DJ-ing at Manchester’s Oasis club as a 20-year-old (playing the music on his own Dansette record player) he moved in 1965 to the original pirate radio station, Radio Caroline, broadcasting from  off the Essex coast and the  Isle of Man. Two years later, the BBC launched the new pop station Radio 1, and beckoned in  his direction. It was the start  of 25 years with the BBC  during which he became a household name. In 1978, he became Radio 1 Breakfast Show host when he took over from Noel Edmonds. At his peak he had nine  million listeners. By now his face, along with that megawatt voice, was familiar to millions because he was a regular host on Top of the Pops, gold bracelets and pendant necklaces jangling, and always surrounded by waves of excited, star-struck young girls. He adored the fame. ‘An ego trip,’ he admitted. ‘I love people to come up and greet me with a “Hiya, Dave, how y’doin”.’ In 1980, the National Hairdressers’ Federation named Travis ‘Head of the Year’. In 1992, the pipe-smoking DJ was made Pipe Man of the Year. But then in 1993, he suddenly resigned from the BBC – on air. ‘Changes are being made here which go against my principles, and I just cannot agree with them,’ he announced to startled listeners. The reality was that Radio 1 had a new controller who wanted to bring in new voices, and DLT’s contract had only ten weeks to run. He knew his time was up. Dave Lee Travis pictured speaking outside Southwark Crown Court today told reporters he has been through a 'year and a half of hell' The veteran DJ claimed he had faced a 'trial by media' during the proceedings. He said he was 'not delighted at all' by the mixed verdict . Since then he has worked for minor stations such as Classic Gold, BBC Three Counties Radio and Spain’s Spectrum FM. Most recently, Dave Lee Travis was broadcasting each weekend from his own studio in his home for Magic AM, going out to eight radio stations in the North. He also presented a music request programme called A Jolly Good Show on the BBC World Service with upwards of 40 million listeners round the world. One letter from India addressed simply ‘DLT, England’, arrived safely on his desk. Another fan was Burmese pro-democracy leader and Nobel prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who revealed after being freed from 15 years of house arrest that listening to his show had made her world ‘much more complete’. The job didn’t pay anything like the big money he used to earn, of course, but almost 50 years after he started out as a DJ, he was at least working. And the Hairy Cornflake could still lay claim to playing a key role in a golden era of British broadcasting, a time of family programmes, an age we still like to describe as innocent.

"By . Geoffrey Levy . Melita Norwood, codenamed Hola, was one of the KGB's most prized spies . She ended her days in a cosy, third-floor rented flat in a sheltered housing complex. Untroubled by the problems of the world, and with the added comfort of her married daughter Anita living nearby, Melita Norwood enjoyed the tranquillity of the small development ringed with flowering trees, and got on with her jam-making until her death, aged 93. How fortunate she was. In many other countries, the grey-haired great-grandmother would have ended her days in prison, or even been shot. For Mrs Norwood was no ordinary granny. Over a period of 35 years, she had been a spy for the KGB, passing on Britain’s nuclear secrets that enabled the Soviet Union to catch up in building the atomic bomb. Two weeks ago, nine years after her death, Melita’s barely-known name unexpectedly re-emerged when the Mitrokhin Archive, a file of top secret Soviet documents, was made available to the public for the first time. The file arrived in Britain in 1992 when KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin defected to Britain, bringing with him, in six trunks, an archive of 30 years of Soviet secrets. Intriguingly, it included profiles of 200 British KGB collaborators written by their Kremlin handlers. Mentioned only by codenames, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, of the infamous ‘Cambridge Five’, got critical mention: Burgess for not dressing tidily and being ‘constantly under the influence of alcohol’, and Maclean for his ‘drunk spells’ and being ‘not very good at keeping secrets’. Melita Norwood, on the other hand — codenamed Hola — was a model of reliability. Her handler described her as ‘a loyal, trustworthy, disciplined agent’ who passed to the KGB a large amount of vital data. Unlike those Mata Hari-style seductresses whose treachery is based in the boudoir, Mrs Norwood was a very different kind of agent. She was, in many ways, the perfect spy, living during most of her long years of treason in a pebble-dash semi in Bexleyheath, South-East London, with her maths and chemistry teacher husband Hilary, growing fresh vegetables in her back garden allotment and bringing up their daughter Anita. No life could have looked more ordinary. Except for one thing — she worked at the British Non‑Ferrous Metals Research Association offices in Euston, central London. Behind this dull company name was an important firm involved in vital research. Towards the end of the war, it was carrying out highly classified government research into the properties of uranium, as part of Britain’s atomic bomb project. Melita (everyone called her ‘Lette’) had joined the company as a clerk in 1937. As a member of the Independent Labour Party, and later the Communist Party, she had already been recruited as an agent at a meeting of the Friends of the Soviet Union. Her bookbinder father was a Latvian immigrant and Left-wing activist whose slogan was ‘Down with everything that’s up, and up with everything that’s down’. He founded the Southern Worker And Labour And Socialist Journal in Southampton. Her mother, too, was a suffragette with far-Left sympathies. Prized: Mrs Norwood, pictured at her home in Bexleyheath, London, in 1999, was a member of the advisory committee on the atom bomb project - a significant help for the Soviet Union . Although her father died when she was six, the family still held Left-wing views which the bright child absorbed from an early age. But as she became head girl of Hitchin Grammar School and captained the hockey team, few could have predicted the extraordinary outcome of such an early communist indoctrination. The girl who had become bored with university life at Southampton after only a year was soon being promoted from clerk to secretary. At the height of the war in 1943, she took time off to have a child, Anita. When she returned to the firm in 1944, she went to work for the director, Dr G. L. Bailey, who wanted Lette because he knew she could cope with the technical jargon. For the KGB, this was an unbelievable piece of good fortune, because Bailey happened to be a member of the advisory committee on the atom bomb project. Working so close to highly classified research, Lette had to go through a security vetting. Incredibly, despite doubts about her extreme Left-wing sympathies and links, she was cleared. Indeed, so trusted was Lette that she had access to Bailey’s two safes. One was in his office and the other at his London home. He kept sensitive documents in both, sometimes holding evening meetings at home at which Lette was expected to be on hand. These usually ended so late that she stayed overnight. Her consequent contribution of atomic intelligence to the Soviet Union was incalculable, certainly big enough for the Russians to declare that she had made ‘a valuable contribution to the development of work in this field’. Lette’s work for the Soviets continued right up until her retirement from the company in 1972, when she was 60. Through all those years, her husband, a fellow Communist Party member who died in 1985, knew she was spying for the KGB. But to the neighbours in Garden Avenue, Bexleyheath, a pleasant street of semis and discreet net curtains, Lette was viewed as a charming old lady who just happened to be a bit eccentric and very openly Left-wing. For example, she used Che Guevara tea mugs and habitually posted copies of the Communist Morning Star through the letterboxes of 32 of her neighbours. No sniff of suspicion: To her neighbours she was a charming old lady who was a little bit eccentric . Everyone liked her. One resident, Robert Leck, 78, a former bomb disposal unit RAF corporal, recalls Lette doing the shopping at the Co-op for other elderly neighbours, visiting anyone she thought might be lonely or unwell. ‘We all knew where her politics lay. I remember her talking to me once about Karl Marx,’ he says. ‘She thought he was the best. ‘And she had her gardening: flowers at the front, vegetables at the back. Who would have thought she was a spy? I certainly didn’t.’ Even after she was publicly exposed in 1999 as having worked for the KGB, neighbours found it very hard to condemn the nice old girl who’d been such a good neighbour for decades. ‘She was lovely, a pure lady,’ says Sheila Howell, who was a neighbour for more than 20 years. MI5 worked out who ‘Hola’ was in 1992, soon after Soviet defector Mitrokhin arrived in Britain with his KGB file. But a decision not to put her on trial was quickly taken so that the collapsing Soviets would remain in ignorance about just how much we knew. When she was unmasked publicly as ‘Hola’ seven years later, no action was taken against her because by then she was 87, and Jack Straw, then Labour Home Secretary, decided that at her age, nothing was to be gained from sending her to prison. Some believe, however, the real reason she was not put on trial was to avoid embarrassing details emerging about MI5’s mistake in allowing her to work as a personal secretary at the very heart of Britain’s secret atomic research, even though she was known to have Communist sympathies. For her part, Lette Norwood didn’t allow exposure of her treachery to ruin her Morning Star delivery routine, which continued uninterrupted. Had she seen for herself her KGB handler’s description of her as ‘loyal’ and ‘trustworthy’, it would have come as no surprise, for this is precisely how she saw herself in doing her bit to ‘prevent the defeat’ of the Communist creed. ‘I did not want money. It was not that side I was interested in. I just wanted Russia to be on equal footing with the West,’ she told the media crowding at her front door in 1999 after being publicly exposed, before politely closing it. In Wombourne, South Staffordshire, 120 miles away, her daughter Anita, a school laboratory technician, was astonished at the revelations about her elderly mother, and described herself as being ‘in a state of disbelief’. When her identity was revealed, the then Home Secretary . ‘Whatever she may have done, I love her,’ said the mother of two. ‘She’s a very good person, very strong and totally unmaterialistic.’ Three years after being exposed, Lette sold the semi in Bexleyheath and moved to be near her daughter, renting a flat in the sheltered housing complex. ‘It was a complete shock at the time,’ says Anita, now 71. ‘I talked to her about the spying, but she told me very little of what she had done, though she did say my father didn’t approve. But she always felt she did the right thing. She told me she would have been prepared to be tried as a war criminal and would have accepted a prison sentence.’ Right up to her death in 2005, Mrs Norwood never wavered from the conviction that what she did was right. The KGB awarded her the prestigious military honour the Order of the Red Banner. It also offered her a pension of £20 a month. She declined it — her spying was, after all, a matter of principle.","Melita Norwood, codenamed Hola, was a prized spy in Moscow .

"By . Chrissy Iley . Michael Sheen has played a lot of alpha males. He's been David Frost in Frost/Nixon, Brian Clough in The Damned United, Tony Blair in The Deal, The Queen, and The Special Relationship. And he's currently filming the second series of the acclaimed US drama Masters Of Sex, in which he's one of the most alpha of them all, Dr William H Masters, the driven scientist whose 1950s research into how the body responds to stimulation sparked the sexual revolution and who has been credited with 'teaching America how to love'. Michael Sheen takes part in the Soccer Aid match in aid of children's charity UNICEF UK tomorrow . In person, Michael's a man of incredible intensity too – though one who can be uproariously funny. He is fiercely focused on the things that are important to him. It's easy to understand, then, why he had it written into his Masters Of Sex contract that he needed a week off to play football. Not just any football. He's team captain in a televised, celebrity-studded Soccer Aid match in aid of children's charity UNICEF UK, and when he plays at Old Trafford tomorrow his childhood dreams will be reignited. Michael, 45, grew up in Port Talbot, South Wales, the birthplace of Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins, which he says is a 'good breeding ground for actors, maybe because there's absolutely nothing to do'. As Kenneth Williams in Fantabulosa! (2006) David Frost in Frost/Nixon (2008) Soccer manager Brian Clough in The Damned United (2009) Tony Blair in The Special Relationship (2010) Masters Of Sex (2013) But his first ticket out of there was actually from Arsenal, who offered a teenage Michael a youth team place. 'Up until I was 13 I was obsessed with football,' he says, 'but going to Arsenal would have meant living in London and Dad said I was too young and I had to wait till I was 16. But by the time I was 16 I had become obsessed with acting.' Football still excites him, though, and he's passionate about raising money for UNICEF and doing it in a way he loves. 'Old Trafford is going to be the scene of one of the greatest football matches of all time,' he smiles. Robbie Williams came up with the idea of Soccer Aid eight years ago and tomorrow he's England's assistant manager and captain, with players including actor Dominic Cooper, pop stars Olly Murs and Mark Owen, and comedian John Bishop. Michael, who plays in defence, is captain of the Rest Of The World. 'Whenever I go anywhere in the world and talk about Soccer Aid I always say, ""And I am your captain,""' he chortles quietly. 'This will be my third Soccer Aid.' His team – coached by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho – includes Scottish actor James McAvoy, Jeremy Renner, who appeared in Avengers and American Hustle, chef Gordon Ramsay and Irish comedian Patrick Kielty. Football legends also playing include Jamie Redknapp, David Seaman and Teddy Sheringham. Michael was born in Newport, Wales, but moved to Liverpool aged five, and then back to Port Talbot three years later with his father Meyrick, who now works as a Jack Nicholson lookalike, and mother Irene, who writes poetry. It was tough for him to suddenly find himself in a school where everyone knew each other and he was the outsider. He had to be good at football to be accepted. 'Football stopped me being picked on,' he says. But then, after the drama teacher at his comprehensive school had put him up for classes at his local youth theatre, he was set on a new path. 'Acting became something that was a great guide through life, through the world.' It's certainly taken him all over the planet but acting isn't the reason he lives in LA. He's there because he wanted to be close to his daughter Lily, 15. Her mother is the actress Kate Beckinsale, and though they split up in 2003, they remain devoted parents. Perhaps because he got tired of people questioning him about his ex, who's since married director Len Wiseman, Michael has become extremely private. I ask him if anyone ever comes up to him in the street to ask him for advice, a la Dr Masters, on their sex lives? 'No, because the character is quite formidable. Not the warmest. People are a bit worried about coming up and asking me stuff. I think I tend to scare them off.' Are he and the character similar? 'When you're playing a character for a long time, you invariably find connections. You do start to mould yourself into the person. So yes, there are a lot of similarities.' He is, however, relaxed talking about two things – Lily and football – saying he only took a part in the Twilight saga (as vampire Aro) so his daughter could be enthusiastic about a film he'd been in.Football, though, is clearly still a pure joy, not just the playing of it, but with Soccer Aid and UNICEF. 'Last year I went to see the work they're doing in Chad in central Africa, and Lebanon, to see how the money we raised in the last Soccer Aid was being spent.' He describes seeing malnourished infants close to death being given life-saving treatment. Michael with Robbie Williams at Soccer Aid 2012 . 'You see them hours away from dying and then leaving healthy. It makes you want to do the best you can. 'I remember sitting in a UNICEF camp opposite a girl the same age as my daughter. This girl's name is Rose. Through an interpreter I said, ""That's a beautiful name. I have a daughter and her name is a flower too."" She told me about her life and I realised just how different Lily and Rose are. It made a very real, direct connection. I couldn't help but see my daughter in her position and vice versa.' Michael's spent the past week training for his big match after jetting in from LA. 'Exercise and running around the training pitch is the best way of getting over jet lag. I don't do a lot of sport these days but I try to keep as fit as I can as I know how unbelievably exhausting playing a match is, and what a strain it puts on a boy in his mid-forties. 'This year it's going to be different. It's not just about fulfilling my dreams, I actually have a direct experience now of what the money that's raised can do to help people. And it's still going to be amazing to walk out in front of 70,000 people at Old Trafford – there really is no feeling like it.' nSoccer Aid, tomorrow, 6pm, ITV.

"By . Chrissy Iley . We are in Tony Bennett's painting studio overlooking New York's Central Park. There's a table full of oil paints, half-finished canvases, watercolours. A bronze bust of Harry Belafonte. Tony Bennett is not a person who paints in old slacks and a cardigan. He's wearing a navy pin-stripe suit, blue shirt, floral tie and a smile that is part angelic, part cheery Cheshire cat. His eyes are large and kind, but you feel there is pain behind them. Tony Bennett describes Amy Winehouse as 'one of the greatest jazz singers of all time' He's 87, still singing, still painting, still taking art classes, still headlining concert tours and putting out at least two albums a year. His latest, The Classics, is a collection of his most loved duets. They include Sinatra, Streisand, Stevie Wonder, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera and Michael Bublé. Poignantly, too, there's a reprise of his 2011 Grammy-winner Body And Soul with the talented but tragic Amy Winehouse, her last-ever track, recorded just a few months before her death in July that year. They developed an unlikely bond. 'Amy Winehouse was one of the greatest jazz singers of all time,' he tells me, gesturing for me to sit with him on his couch. 'In many ways she achieved what she wanted to do. It's regrettable that she died so young.' Long pause. 'She was wonderful.' Did she ever talk to him about her problems or her addiction to drugs and alcohol? There's another long pause. 'I wanted her to...' he begins. 'Cary Grant, the handsomest man in the world, sorry for name-dropping, suggested before he died (in 1986) that for my 85th birthday I should play the London Palladium.' When he reached his 80s, Bennett began making plans for the Palladium show and wanted Amy to play there with him. 'I was so sad she died before I had the chance to ask her,' he says. Tony with the singing legend, Frank Sinatra who features on his new duets album . They were strangely kindred spirits. In the 70s when his kind of jazz standard style seemed old-fashioned and was muted by the excesses of rock, Bennett himself smoked pot and did cocaine. You can't imagine him not talking about such things with Winehouse. He's said in the past, 'When you get into drugs you hide from the public. You sneak around. I got caught up in it. When the Kennedys and Martin Luther King were assassinated in the 1960s, our country took a terrible turn. Everybody got wasted.' Now he explains, 'I wasn't doing a huge amount. I was smoking pot and doing a little bit of cocaine. People get addicted and everything changes for the worse.' In fact he became seriously ill from a cocaine overdose in 1979 when he had to be revived in the bath by his second wife Sandra Grant. He managed to avoid rehab, but then came a seminal moment. 'The manager of (comedian) Lenny Bruce told me he sinned against his talent with his drug habit. That sentence changed my life. I've been given this gift. I know how to sing and perform. I'm sinning against this gift and I thought, ""I am not going to do that any more"", and I just stopped. I had to, because I thought I was going to lose everything. It was said at the right moment, at the right time.' No other help? 'No, just like that.' He confides that he had an addictive personality, but the only thing he's hooked on now is chocolate. 'But if you eat it in moderation, you're not going to get into trouble. It's good to take care of yourself. It took me years to realise that, but now I'm content. I don't have to worry about what I'm doing. I sleep well. I'm doing so much better. I exercise three times a week with a trainer.' Tony  and Lady Gaga pose backstage after her show at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, April, 2014 . It seems everybody wants to sing with him and no one - in a career spanning over 60 years - seems to have had a bad word to say about him. He seems to have made no enemies. His smile turns into a grin. 'I try to be a good person, you know.' How has he made all these unlikely duets - others in his career include Elton John, Andrea Bocelli, Aretha Franklin and Willie Nelson - come about? 'We like to go to where they live so they feel comfortable, rather than have them come to us. Paris, California, wherever.' He married his third wife, Susan Crow, 35 years his junior, in 2007. 'It was her father who introduced us. We hit it off from the beginning. We worked together establishing my schools for the performing arts.' There are now 17 of them, named after his late friend Frank Sinatra, with whom he sings New York, New York on his album. Bennett's career catapulted in the 50s after Sinatra stated in a magazine, 'For my money, Tony Bennett is the best singer in the world.' 'Sinatra's fans became interested in me and I sold out all over the world. He did change my career. I owe him so much.' Duetting with Lady Gaga, with whom he sings The Lady Is A Tramp on the album, has raised as many eyebrows as Amy Winehouse. 'Everyone expects Lady Gaga to be a bit strange. Not at all, she's very intelligent and a great singer. She's one of the most talented people I've ever met. She knows how to be absolutely unpredictable.' Bennett has played for more presidents than any other living musician. 'President Clinton was the first president I felt I didn't have to stand to attention for. He knows a lot about music. I really like President Obama. He's working hard to stop all wars. I sung for him with Stevie Wonder.' Music and painting were always his great loves. He sold his first painting to Cary Grant. 'It was a scene in the South of France. He liked it because the view from his window in the Hollywood Hills looked very similar to the painting.' In his studio, he currently has several paintings in progress. A couple of portraits of women - local art students who pose as models. And up on the easel there's a large scene of Central Park, impressionistic happy colours. 'Sinatra's fans became interested in me and I sold out all over the world. He did change my career. I owe him so much.' 'I paint whenever I can. If I don't I miss it, and if you keep doing something, it becomes effortless. It's not a struggle to do the few things I love. I like to say I've never worked a day in my life, because I'm doing the things I love.' Bennett is also a civil rights champion, which goes back to when he served in World War II. He was shocked by the racism he encountered. He was reprimanded for bringing a black friend to a dinner at his hotel even though he was told he could bring any guest he wanted. 'My captain called me out, cut off my corporal stripes, threw them to the ground and put me on grave duty. I had to pick up dead bodies to register them. That incident affected my whole being.' He says he's never had to choose between his music and his art. 'When I was growing up, my Italian American family, all the aunts and uncles, would come over every Sunday to help my mum out because my father was ill for a long time before he died when I was ten. My mother Anna was a seamstress and worked day and night for a penny a dress to put food on the table for three children. 'When the relatives came over I would sing for them and also show them my art. Everyone told me I painted and sang very well and I remember clearly saying this is who I am. I had a very strong passion and to this day I still have that passion and that is still who I am, and I'm still learning.'
