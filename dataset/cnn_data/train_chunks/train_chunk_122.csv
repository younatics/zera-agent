"(CNN) -- When Black Caviar lines up at Morphetville, Adelaide, on Sunday in front of an anticipated crowd of 30,000, the Australian wonder horse will carry the weight not only of jockey Luke Nolen but the expectations of an entire nation. The superstar mare will be bidding for her 20th win from 20 races. If she succeeds, she will have gone one better than the great Zenyatta, who faltered at the 20th attempt. Black Caviar has already overhauled the marks of such racing legends as Eclipse (undefeated in 18 races) and Nearco (14). Indeed, one has to go all the way back to Kincsem, a 19th century Hungarian racehorse, to find a more impressive streak (although her barely creditable record of 54 wins and no defeats seems safe for the time being). The Black Caviar phenomenon has gripped a sports-mad Australian public. Of the capacity crowd expected to turn out on Sunday, a good proportion will be wearing her trademark salmon and black silks. The appetite for all things Black Caviar is so great that the state government has arranged free public transport for all those heading to the track. She will face only a small number of rivals on Sunday. Such is the aura of invincibility surrounding Black Caviar, she typically races against just a handful of other runners. She is currently being quoted by some bookmakers at odds of 1-20 (and no, that's not a misprint) for the Group 1 clash, ahead of last year's Goodwood winner Lone Rock at 14-1. But despite having beaten the best Australian racehorses of her generation -- including Hay List and Foxwedge, both classy runners in their own right -- Black Caviar remains unproven on the global stage. That is set to change, however. In June, Black Caviar will get the chance to test herself against the best in the world when she travels to England for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. For Australians, Black Caviar's English endeavor is something of a national cause. But if she has little left to prove to an adoring public back home, a question mark remains over Black Caviar's claims to greatness on the world stage, and that question mark comes in the not-insubstantial shape of a four-year-old bay colt called Frankel. The only horse in the world with a higher rating than Black Caviar, the inevitable clamor for a showdown between the two best horses in the world is likely to reach deafening pitch should Black Caviar win again on Sunday. A match race seems unlikely since the two horses prefer to race over different distances: sprints of 1,000 -1,200 meters for Black Caviar; the mile and upwards for Frankel. That hasn't prevented billionaire owner Sheikh Fahad al Thani from sponsoring a Â£1 million purse should the two horses line up for the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Gooodwood in August. It would mean a step up in trip for Black Caviar to the mile, over undulating ground that is likely to favor the defending champion Frankel with his huge, all-devouring stride. But with 20 million Australians backing her every furlong of the way, you wouldn't bet against her. Comparing champions: Black Caviar vs. Zenyatta . The similarities between the two great race mares are evident. Both horses are huge (Black Caviar stands at 16.2 HH while Zenyatta stood at a carthorse-like 17.2 HH), and their hulking frames meant they were each only lightly raced in their early years (larger horses usually take longer to develop). Zenyatta became a racing -- and sporting -- phenomenon in America, finishing runner-up twice in the Associated Press's Female Athlete of the Year award (once to Serena Williams and once to Lindsay Vonn). Black Caviar's following in Australia is so huge that Channel 7 interrupted the Australian Open tennis semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray to televise one of her races. Zenyatta was named after the album ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" by British band the Police, who were signed to the record label of her owner, Jerry Moss. Black Caviar was named by one of her owners, Pam Hawkes, who has a taste for the delicacy. It also refers back to the mare's grandmother, Scandanavia.","Superstar mare Black Caviar will make history if she wins at Morphetville .

"(CNN) -- Jonathan Alpeyrie has photographed 10 wars. He's captured violence in Somalia, Afghanistan, South Ossetia and Libya. But his recent week taking pictures of rebels in Syria was the most intense, frightening experience of his career. He compares it to Afghanistan when he was embedded in 2010 with the French Foreign Legion. ""If there's a fight, the French soldiers are trained; they're going to protect you. They are skilled in combat and can fight back,"" he said. ""In Syria, anything goes. The rebels want you to tell the story, but what they don't tell you is if something bad happens, they spread out. They leave you. You're unprotected. ""For me, the stress level was high at all times."" See Alpeyrie's photos of rebels and refugees fleeing Syria by dark . Alpeyrie, a 33-year-old French-American, worked with Greek photojournalist George Moutafis, whose Syrian contacts helped lead them across the Turkish border into Syria. They spent one week photographing rebels -- many just ordinary Syrians who've taken up arms -- as they battle military forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Syria has been locked for more than a year in a bloody conflict that began when protesters started demanding that al-Assad relinquish power. The movement grew out of the Arab Spring, a larger phenomenon across the Middle East and North Africa in which Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans successfully protested for the removal of their leaders in 2011. In Syria, opposition forces report that as many as 10,000 people have died since March 2011. It's been incredibly difficult to know for certain what is happening in Syria because al-Assad has banned journalists from entering the country to cover the conflict. Several journalists who have gotten in to cover the violence have been wounded or killed. Alpeyrie knew the risks. ""I wanted to go,"" he said. Alpeyrie, Moutafis and the Syrians who helped them cross into the country had to move at night in pitch blackness, walking seven miles to a village where rebels and their families were hiding. They trudged over mountainous, rocky soil carrying their equipment, their heads hurting with worry that they could trip mines scattered along the border. ""There's a lot of fighting in the mountains. [We heard] machine-gun fire,"" said Alpeyrie. ""The problem with that is you really don't know what's going on and who's who. You have no idea if you're going to be able to get out [of Syria] once you're inside."" When they came to the rebels' village, they saw houses made of stone and concrete. Alpeyrie relied on the contacts who helped them make it to the village to do the introductions. Neither he nor Moutafis speaks Arabic. The villagers assumed from Alpeyrie's accent that he was French. Though he went to college in Chicago and lives in New York, the photographer never would have brought up his ties to the United States, he said. ""I never told anybody I have an American background. That's a big no-no,"" he said. If he had, the rebels' families would still help him out of kindness but ""they wouldn't like you as much."" ""You have to remember these people are conservative Muslims and America is still a problem for them, even though they wish America would help them,"" he said. The Syrians took to calling Alpeyrie ""Nicolas Sarkozy,"" the photographer said with a laugh. Though the families were incredibly poor, they generously gave Alpeyrie and Moutafis a little rice, hummus and pita bread. Alpeyrie got most of his shots by using their homes as shelter. ""You're hiding a lot in houses and rooms,"" he said. ""You can't really [for safety reasons] get out and photograph as much as you'd like to."" As the days went on, the photographer noticed that he rarely saw many rebels together at one time. They came by in small groups -- maybe a dozen at once. ""That's because they are retreating,"" Alpeyrie said. ""They are losing this war. They don't have the equipment to stop the [Syrian Army]."" He managed to photograph one rebel riding his horse as other fighters napped nearby on a woven rug, their guns propped against a concrete wall. Alpeyrie stood close to another rebel to get a shot of the young man, cigarette dangling from his mouth, pointing his gun toward an area where Syrian snipers were positioned. Shortly after photographing this exhausted fighter, the photojournalist started to get a bad feeling. His gut told him that he'd pressed his luck enough. ""We told our contact on the ground that we want to get out of here,"" he said. ""We said we're done with our work."" Alpeyrie's instincts were dead on. Just days later, the Syrian military decimated the nearby town of Idlib, once a rebel stronghold. Alpeyrie and Moutafis began their journey out of Syria by simply walking in the direction of the border, accompanied by the people who had helped get them inside the country. Eventually they connected with their helpers' families who were trying to flee into Turkey. Again, they had to hike in complete darkness. Occasionally, when the time seemed right, Alpeyrie asked one of the refugees to hold up a flashlight so he could take a photo. At one point, he captured a little boy in motion wearing a bright green sweater adorned with a heart and the word ""Happy."" One of the Syrian fathers traveling with them had two babies and couldn't both hold the infants and grasp trees as he navigated through the darkness. So the man handed Alpeyrie one of the babies and the photographer held the child as he struggled across the hilly terrain. The group reached a camp and were able to get in the back of a truck that drove them a final 500 yards to the Turkish border. Alpeyrie remembers seeing the Turkish towers come into view. ""You're relieved,"" he said. ""You don't even care if the Turkish army catches you. You know you're safe by then.""","French-American photographer got into Syria through Turkey .

"(CNN) -- One long, brutal year has passed since the Syrian people launched their revolution, demanding an end to the dictatorship of President Bashar al-Assad. Since then, the regime has killed at least 8,000 people, according to the U.N., and it has sent the rest of the world a quiet but blunt message: You are fools. Fools because much of the world fell for, and even participated in, al-Assad's manipulative, decade-long game in which he portrayed himself as a modernizer and reformer. But now we know what al-Assad really thought about reform. In his own, ultramodern shorthand: LOL. From the day he came to power in 2000, al-Assad, a London-educated ophthalmologist, has used the media and massaged the egos of politicians to put forth the fiction that he would bring freedom and openness to Syria. But the charade started to come apart one year ago. If the massacres committed by Syrian forces on his behalf had not provided enough proof that the image was all fake, a new trove of private e-mails confirms just how far Western observers had missed the mark when they judged the lanky doctor-turned-dictator as one of the good guys. The Guardian obtained 3,000 e-mails from private accounts used by the president, under the address sam@alshahba.com, and his wife, Asma, as ak@alshahba.com. The Guardian says the e-mails, which were provided by a Syrian opposition source, are verified as real by many of its correspondents. They confirm that Bashar and his stylish, British-born wife are keenly tuned into the modern world. They shop extravagantly online and consume mass-market cultural fare such as Harry Potter, ""America's Got Talent"" and country music. Their e-mail discussions about shoes, jewelry, chandeliers and fondue pots, along with ideas about how to put down the uprising and how to spin the events for foreign audiences, occurred between June and February, as forces loyal to al-Assad slaughtered thousands of mostly unarmed protesters. In one e-mail, al-Assad laughs at democratic reforms. When his wife tells him she'll come home early one day, he quips, ""This is the best reform any country can have that u told me where will you be, we are going to adopt it instead of the rubbish laws of parties, elections, media ..."" Other e-mails show one of al-Assad's media advisers, Shererazad Jaafari, whose father is Syria's U.N. ambassador, helping arrange interviews with American networks such as ABC and dealing with CNN. Al-Assad joked with Hadeel al-Ali, one of his media consultants, while Arab League monitors were in Syria seeking to bring an end to the carnage. Al-Assad ridiculed the mission, sending al-Ali a YouTube parody of the violence that uses children's toys. ""Check out this video,"" he wrote. She responded with, ""Hahahahahahaha, OMG!!!"" If there is any hint that al-Assad has any misgivings about the human cost of his political survival, it comes in an e-mail that attaches an iTunes download of a country song by Blake Shelton, with the lyrics written out for Asma: ""I've been a walking heartache / I've made a mess of me / The person that I've been lately / Ain't who I wanna be."" Al-Assad and his wife have been deftly playing international public opinion from the beginning. A Washington Post article in April 2000, a few weeks before he became president, describes him as ""soft-spoken and congenial, a fan of Faith Hill and Phil Collins ... mapping his own path by trying to address the social and economic demands of the next generation."" Two months later, The New York Times explained that ""thanks to an orchestrated campaign in the state news media to credit him with fighting corruption and promoting a more open economy, Dr. Assad also is seen as a beacon of hope for a new, more relaxed Syria."" The image held for years, even if the reforms never quite arrived. In 2005, the Bush administration withdrew the American ambassador to Syria, and European countries froze relations with Damascus for its role in the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. But the Obama administration and many in the Washington establishment and in Europe still believed that al-Assad was a closet reformer. As recently as April, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said members of both parties ""believe he's a reformer."" And Sen. John Kerry, who has met al-Assad about half a dozen times, said he expected that al-Assad would enact meaningful reforms. Over the years, al-Assad's wife, Asma, cast a spell on the media. In February 2011, Vogue magazine published a glowing spread about the fashionable first lady entitled ""A Rose in the Desert."" The article explained that ""In Syria, power is hereditary"" but called the al-Assads ""wildly democratic."" Asma has always been key element of the propaganda effort. Former Bush administration official Flynt Leverett praised al-Assad, saying, ""I think who a man marries says a good deal about him."" The first lady, he said, ""is going to bring exposure to absolute world-class standards and practices in the globalized economy of the 21st century."" Clearly, Bashar and Asma al-Assad are creatures of the modern world. They watch YouTube videos, shop online and use secret e-mail pseudonyms. I bet they're buying the latest iPads. But those in the West who believed that their modernity meant they would bring democratic reform got it all wrong. What their experience in the West taught them was not a love of democracy and human rights. Instead, it showed them how to manipulate the media and how to create an image that would let them rule by the old-fashioned ways of dictatorship: by imprisoning and killing opponents. Anyone who believed otherwise was taken for a fool. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","The Guardian obtained e-mails from private accounts of Bashar al-Assad and his wife .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- I'll Have Another cut loose on the home stretch to run down Bodemeister and earn the first Kentucky Derby wins for his rider and trainer Saturday. I'll Have Another, with a finish of 2:01:83, earned nearly $1.5 million of the $2.2 million purse. That's quite a payoff for a horse that was purchased last year for the modest sum of $35,000. Jockey Mario Gutierrez, making his Derby debut, called I'll Have Another a steady competitor. ""They didn't believe (I'll Have Another) could have made it this far,"" Gutierrez said. ""But even if they wanted me to pick (any horse in the field), I would have stayed with him."" The winner had 15-1 odds; Bodemeister was at 4-1, according to the Derby website. Dullahan, with 12-1 odds, also made a late run and finished third. I'll Have Another defeated Bodemeister by more than one length at the 1Â¼-mile classic, attended by a record Churchill Downs crowd. The 138th running was marked by a couple of other Derby firsts: It was the first victory for trainer Doug O'Neill and the first win from the No. 19 post position with a full field. O'Neill called Gutierrez ""the man"" for his own performance. ""He was just so confident,"" O'Neill told NBC. ""We had such a brilliant race."" Bob Baffert, a Derby stalwart and the trainer of Bodemeister, said he was ""really proud of the way"" his horse ran. ""He just came up a little tired,"" Baffert told NBC afterward. Having won all three races he's participated in this year, O'Neill said he was excited for the next leg of the Triple Crown -- the 137th edition of the Preakness, set for May 19 in Baltimore. ""Maryland, here we come,"" he said. Gutierrez thanked all those involved in the effort as well as his family in Mexico and ""my beautiful second family"" in Canada. This year's Derby was noted for a particularly strong field. Other favorites included Union Rags, at 5-1; Gemologist, 8-1, and Hansen, 13-1. Went the Day Well, at 30-1, finished fourth. A record crowd of more than 165,000 revelers took in what's called ""the most exciting two minutes in sports"" or ""the fastest two minutes in sports."" Gotta Watch: The Derby professionals . Nicknamed the ""Run for the Roses"" for the garland that is draped over the winner, the Kentucky Derby traces its rich history back to 1875, when Col.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Former rebels attacked the office of Libya's interim prime minister in central Tripoli on Tuesday in an apparent protest over outstanding payments promised by the government to ex-fighters, witnesses said. The rebels circled the building in heavily armed pickup trucks, carrying weapons including anti-aircraft guns, and opened fire in the air and at the building, an official at the prime minister's office said. The attackers, some dressed in army fatigues and others in civilian clothing, were from two towns in Libya's Western Mountains, said eyewitnesses and a member of the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade, another group of former fighters. Clashes ensued with guards from the prime minister's office, and fighters from the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade were called in as reinforcements to protect the building, they said. A member of the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade told CNN that a fellow brigade member was killed in the clashes. Roads were sealed off in the area while the situation was brought under control. The fighters had converged on the building with a number of demands, including the payments promised by the government to former fighters, the official in the prime minister's office and a member of the brigade said. There have been delays in these payments and similar protests have taken place, including one last month when former rebels opened fire inside the prime minister's building. While life is slowly returning to normal in the Libyan capital, armed clashes happen occasionally, underscoring one of the main problems facing post-revolution Libya. Thousands of former rebels are still heavily armed, and the government has not yet been able to disarm them or integrate them into the security forces. Building a strong army and police force has been one of the priorities highlighted by Libyan officials, but the process has been slow. This has prompted criticism from many Libyans, who accuse the government and the National Transitional Council of failing to address this issue. Libya is scheduled to hold elections next month, the first since the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime last summer. Registration of candidates and voters began May 1, ahead of the June 19 vote.","Former rebels with heavily armed pickup trucks surround interim prime minister's office .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea booked a semifinal date with Champions League holders Barcelona with a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge over 10-man Benfica Wednesday. But their passage was not assured until substitute Raul Meireles scored the clinching goal in injury time. A first half penalty from Frank Lampard was canceled out by a late Javi Garcia header for the battling visitors, who had Maxi Pereira sent off just before halftime. Chelsea, who won 1-0 win in Lisbon last week, went through 3-1 on aggregate. Real Madrid thrashed spirited Cypriot minnows Apoel Nicosia 5-2 in their quarterfinal second leg in the Santiago Bernebeu stadium to win 8-2 on aggregate. Bayern Munich await Jose Mourinho's men in the last four. Cristiano Ronaldo put Real ahead midway through the first half as he connected with Marcelo's cross. Former World Player of the Year Kaka capped an electrifying first half performance with the second on 36 minutes with a curling shot. The visitors, the first Cypriot team to reach the last eight of the Champions League, had brief cause for celebration through a Gustavo Manduca goal just after the hour mark, but Ronaldo grabbed his second with a stunning free kick to re-open a two-goal advantage on the night. It was his eighth in the Champions League this season and leaves him one short of 50 in all competitions. Jose Callejon made it four for Real, but the visitors were not finished yet. Hamit Altintop brought down Adorno for a penalty and Estbeban Solari sent Iker Casillas the wrong way. An impudent chip from Angel di Maria rounded off the Real scoring on an eventful night. Chelsea's continued their passage under interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, but their fans were kept on the edge of their seats until the very end of their second leg tie. Benfica made a bright start but when Garcia brought down Ashley Cole to concede a penalty, well-taken by Lampard, Chelsea could breath easier. Pereira, who had been needlessly booked for dissent, was shown his second yellow for a studs up challenge on Jon Obi Mikel to leave his side with an uphill task. But Chelsea wasted chances to wrap up the match, Ramires missing from close range and Fernando Torres firing agonizingly wide to leave Benfica with late hope. That was intensified as Garcia rose unmarked to head past Petr Cech only for Mereiles to burst clear and score with a thumping shot. A relieved Di Matteo said that he had always expected a tough passage to the semifinals. ""We knew before the game we were going to face a difficult game tonight and it proved that. ""Benfica are a good side, but we are pleased we are in the semifinal now. The second goal was missing to kill the game. With a 1-0 lead they still had a chance and they knew that. We missed a lot of chances to kill the game,"" he told ITV Sport.","Chelsea beat 10-man Benfica 2-1 at Stamford Bridge .

"(CNN) -- Formula One is a sport where fine margins separate success and failure, with teams going to extreme lengths to squeeze fractions of a second out of their precision-engineered racing machines. As a result, constructors jealously guard the secrets behind the design of their car. If those details were to fall into the hands of a rival team, it could dent a potential world championship charge. With that in mind, the Force India team pursued Italian wind tunnel manufacturer Aerolab for £15 million ($23.6 million), eventually reduced to £13 million ($20 million), after claiming aspects of their 2009 car design had been replicated by a rival team. What followed was a British High Court case involving Force India, Aerolab, and F1 marque Team Lotus -- now known as Caterham. 2012 Formula One teams and drivers . Aerolab initially launched a claim against Force India, run by team principal Vijay Mallya, for unpaid funds. The case was complicated when, shortly after their split from Force India, Aerolab signed a contract to work on Lotus' 2010 car. A statement issued by Aerolab's legal representatives on Wednesday said the company had been ordered to pay €25,000 ($39,500) in damages after work conducted during their contract with Force India had been used on Lotus' 2010 car. The statement read: ""The Honorable Mr Justice Arnold held that Aerolab's CAD designers had misused certain of Force India's confidential information as a means of taking a 'short cut' to produce a wind tunnel model which could begin to be used for testing as soon as possible. ""He further held that a small number of the relevant wind tunnel model components had found their way as full size components into the car which Caterham F1 Team (then racing under the name of Team Lotus) had raced at the beginning of the 2010 season."" It was a victory for Force India, but an expensive one. Despite ruling Aerolab had incorrectly used intellectual property, the judge also said Force India must pay €846,230 ($1.3 million) in unpaid fees. It was also decreed that Force India's claim of ""systematic copying"" by Lotus, in particular chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne, was unfounded. Force India were unavailable for comment but a statement was issued on their official website. It said Force India will report the case to F1's global governing body, the FIA, while continuing a criminal case against Caterham team principal Tony Fernandes, Gascoyne and Aerolab owner Jean-Claude Migeot. ""The UK High Court judgment, in respect of the illegal copying, will now be referred for the consideration of Formula One's governing body,"" read the statement. ""The Italian criminal case against Mike Gascoyne, Tony Fernandes and Jean Claude Migeot remains ongoing.""","An Italian design company has been ordered by a British court to pay Force India $39,500 .

"(CNN) -- Omar Suleiman, whom former President Hosni Mubarak had appointed vice president shortly before his exit, announced Friday that he plans to enter the race to become Egypt's next president. The former head of Egyptian intelligence recently said he did not plan to seek the presidency in the first election for the post since the revolution that led to Mubarak's exit. But on Friday, as his supporters took to the streets urging him to run, Suleiman did an about-face and said he will now ""participate in the nominations, regardless of my previous statement about the difficulties and challenges."" ""I promise you, my brothers and sisters, to complete the goals of the revolution and provide security and stability to the Egyptian people,"" he said in a written statement. Thousands of his backers gathered Friday in Cairo's Abbasiya Square, where unknown assailants drove by and fired into the crowd, his campaign said. Shortly after reporting the attack, the state-run MENA news agency said 15 people were ""injured in clashes between Suleiman supporters (and) thugs."" Suleiman is no stranger to the Egyptian government, and has been closely tied to Mubarak -- the man whose resignation, under intense pressure, spurred the political upheaval that led to, among other things, this election. Leading opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei has said that Suleiman and Mubarak are ""twins."" ""His loyalty to Mubarak seems rock solid,"" a former U.S. ambassador wrote in 2007 in a classified U.S. diplomatic cable leaked to the website WikiLeaks. And he could become Egypt's first president since Mubarak -- assuming he can collect 30,000 valid signatures by this weekend and beat out what is already a crowded field of candidates. More than 450 people have entered the race -- including Muslim Brotherhood candidate Khairat al-Shater; former Egyptian Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa; and Ayman Nour, an opposition leader jailed by Mubarak who was recently pardoned. The official three-week campaigning period starts April 30. No candidate can spend more than 10 million Egyptian pounds ($1.65 million) ahead of the election, which starts May 23. Suleiman is well-respected by the military, whose leaders have ostensibly ruled Egypt during these months of political transition, and has been credited with crushing an Islamic insurgency in the 1990s. Last year, then-U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Suleiman ""is someone that we know well and have worked closely with."" Mubarak named him Egypt's vice president in late January 2011, the first time anyone had held such a position since Mubarak came to power in 1981. Less than two weeks later, Suleiman said that Mubarak had resigned and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces would ""run the affairs of the country"" -- ending his extensive government career, at least for the time being. Born in an impoverished area of southern Egypt in 1935, Suleiman chose the military as a career and rose to the rank of lieutenant general, according to a Foreign Policy magazine biography. He trained in both the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He became head of the Egyptian General Intelligence Organization in 1993, at a time when the Arab world's most populous nation was wracked by terrorist attacks targeting tourists and essential infrastructure. Defense and security analysis company IHS Jane's said that Suleiman's ascension was helped by his interactions with the Israeli Mossad as well as the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Author Ron Suskind, whose 2006 book ""The One Percent Doctrine"" focused on the post-9/11 counterterrorism policies of U.S. President George W. Bush's administration, said that Suleiman wielded significant power, and flexed his muscles, behind the scenes. ""If someone knocks on your door and you disappear, Omar Suleiman is probably behind it,"" Suskind told CNN last year. ""He is a feared man, and certainly not a man with any legitimacy when it comes to rule of law or any of the principles we prize in America."" Alaa Awad, a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, said it is conceivable that Suleiman ""was taking orders from Mubarak and ... that his experience as an intelligence official may come in handy by uplifting Egypt's security."" But he added that ""any revolutionary logic cannot accept that a vice president appointed by Mubarak becomes the nation's next president."" ""The fact remains that he was from Mubarak's inner circle, so it's not acceptable under any circumstances,"" Awad said. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's not acceptable"" a Mubarak insider is president, a Muslim Brotherhood figure says .

"(CNN) -- Family and close friends will say goodbye to Whitney Houston with a private funeral and burial Saturday in her native New Jersey, trying to come to grips with grief that the pastor of her childhood church called ""very deep."" ""We are all hurting,"" Pastor Joe Carter of New Hope Baptist Church in Newark told CNN's Jason Carroll on Tuesday. ""That voice is silenced. But she left us with so much."" Earlier in the day, Carolyn Whigham -- the owner of Whigham Funeral Home in the northern New Jersey city -- said that Houston's funeral will start at noon Saturday at that church. Carter said that he'll officiate what he described as a ""small ... invite-only service."" The church seats a maximum of 1,500 people, and the pastor said he expects ""all these empty pews to be filled with people whose hearts are broken."" ""She was able to leave us with so many wonderful memories of that God-given gift,"" he said. ""That's what we are celebrating on Saturday."" At the request of the late singer's mother Cissy Houston, the eulogy will be given by Marvin Winans, a gospel singer and pastor at Detroit's Perfecting Church, Carter later told CNN's Erin Burnett. Winans officiated Houston's 1992 marriage ceremony to R&B singer Bobby Brown. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told reporters Tuesday that he planned to issue an executive order so that flags at government buildings throughout the late entertainer's native state would fly at half-staff on the day of her funeral. There will be no large-scale public memorial in Newark in the immediate aftermath of Houston's death, city spokeswoman Anne Torres said. The funeral director at the Whigham Funeral Home told city officials that the family did not want a big memorial, according to Torres. Carter, the New Hope pastor, said organizers hope to set up a large screen outside his church, so people who cannot get inside can see the funeral proceedings. The pop superstar's body was flown to New Jersey's Teterboro Airport from California on a private plane belonging to filmmaker Tyler Perry, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the situation. Late Monday, her body arrived at the Whigham Funeral Home -- borne by a hearse and escorted by police -- as a large crowd looked on. Cissy Houston, the late singer's mother, was waiting inside, police said. New Hope's pastor described Cissy Houston -- herself a well-known gospel singer who was active at the church -- as a ""strong, strong woman."" ""Her heart is broken: Nobody expects to bury her child,"" Carter said. ""But she is managing it with miraculous strength. She is so grateful for prayers and thoughts, and that's holding her together."" Whitney Houston, 48, was found dead Saturday in her suite at the upscale Beverly Hilton, just hours before she was scheduled to attend a pre-Grammy bash at the hotel. Why she died remains a mystery. Despite widespread media speculation, a Los Angeles County coroner official Monday downplayed the suspicion that drugs played a major role. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said that ""not many prescription bottles"" were found in the singer's room after her death. The amount of medications recovered by investigators was less than what is usually present in deaths attributed to overdoses, Winter said. ""I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in,"" he said. Winter ruled out foul play and said there were no injuries to Houston's body. The singer's soaring voice and impressive talent had taken a back seat in recent years to her struggles with drug addiction. However, a close family friend who was also at the funeral home told CNN's Deb Feyerick on Tuesday that Houston was ""no longer an addict,"" meaning she was no longer using ""hard drugs."" The friend said Houston was taking medication for a throat infection and Xanax for anxiety and to help her sleep. And it was not uncommon for her to have a drink when she went out, he said. The friend asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. ""She had let it go,"" he said. ""And we were proud of her."" He said he had seen Houston about two weeks ago in New Jersey, and she told him, ""I'm at a comfortable place in my life."" The friend said Houston had been ""clean"" from hard drugs for three years and had not used cocaine or marijuana, and added that her family is upset by media coverage focusing on her history of drug problems. ""In her life, she made some bad decisions, but let's not forget the good ones,"" he said, recalling how she returned to Newark at Christmas and gave to those in need. ""... She took care of foster children, and children with AIDS."" And a singer who participated in an impromptu duet with Houston at a party Thursday night said Houston was not behaving erratically. ""I didn't see someone who was high,"" Kelly Price told CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Monday. During the party, Houston took the stage unexpectedly and sang a hoarse rendition of ""Jesus Loves Me"" with Price. Whitney Houston: A mother, a daughter, a friend . Houston's body was released to her family Monday, a day after an autopsy was conducted in Los Angeles. Winter, from the coroner's office, said that results of toxicology tests could take six to eight weeks, though Beverly Hills police Lt. Mark Rosen said Tuesday that the coroner's report is expected to be finished sooner -- in two to three weeks. That report's conclusions into what Rosen now describes as an ""unattended, unexpected death"" will drive what investigators do next, the police spokesman said. Beverly Hills police have requested a ""security hold"" on the coroner's report, a common practice in high-profile cases that limits what can be revealed about an investigation while it is ongoing. Reverend: The Whitney I knew . Asked how long Houston had been dead before she was found, Winter said she only that she was seen alive within an hour of her death. Houston's body was found by her assistant, Mary Jones, who was often called ""Aunt Mary,"" a family source said Tuesday. Earlier, Winter had confirmed reports that the songstress was found in the bathtub of her hotel room. Houston's 18-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina, was in the care of her grandmother Cissy and her father, Bobby Brown, the close family friend said Tuesday. Houston and Brown divorced in 2007. Brown released a statement Tuesday saying his daughter, after a ""visit with doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Saturday,"" is now ""with my family, including her (half-) siblings."" ""Obviously, the death of her mother is affecting her,"" said Brown, known as a member of the group New Edition. ""However we will get through this tragedy as a family."" LZ Granderson: Sad, but no shock . On Monday night, Aretha Franklin -- the singer known as the ""Queen of Soul"" and Houston's godmother -- honored her at a concert in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to CNN affiliate WSOC. Franklin called Houston ""one of the greatest singers that has ever stood before a microphone,"" and sang Houston's smash hit song, ""I Will Always Love You,"" the station said.

"(CNN) -- Susie Wolff, the second woman to join Formula One in recent weeks, hopes her new role will pave the way for more females in the elite level of motorsport. The 29-year-old Briton was signed to Williams as a development driver on Wednesday, just weeks after Spaniard Maria de Villota joined Marussia in a testing role. ""I hope to demonstrate women can play a role at the highest levels of motorsport,"" Wolff said. ""I shall be working closely with the team on its social responsibility program in the areas of education and road safety."" Wolff is just the seventh female F1 driver in the 60-year history of the sport and her recruitment, along with De Villota, has been seen as an important step forward in the gender divide. However ""Racy Susie,"" as she has been labeled in the British tabloid press, may still have some way to go before changing old-fashioned thinking at the top. F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, who has long wanted a competitive female driver on the grid, welcomed Wolff's arrival. ""If Susie is as quick in a car as she looks good out of a car then she will be a massive asset to any team and on top of that she is very intelligent,"" the 81-year-old said. Wolff will be undertaking some aerodynamic and full-track testing of the team's FW34 F1 championship car as well as attending a number of races. Her role was approved by the Williams board, of which Wolff's husband, Toto, is a member. He sat out the selection process. Susie, who lives in Switzerland, is no stranger to the driver's seat. She first began karting as a child before moving into single-seaters in 2001 with a drive in the Formula Renault series. She was twice nominated for the prestigious Young Driver of the Year Award and enjoyed a spell in the British Formula Three championship before joining Germany's DTM touring car series in 2006. Wolff has been in a Formula One cockpit before, having received a test drive courtesy of the team formerly known as Lotus Renault F1 at Paul Ricard in August last year, where she achieved 300 kilometers of track time. De Villota, daughter of former British Formula One Series Champion Emilio de Villota, also has experience racing at the Spanish F3, the Daytona 24 Hours, the Euroseries 3000 and Superleague Formula Championship. Of the five women to join F1 before Wolff and De Villota, only two have ever qualified to start a race. The most prolific of these was Italian Lella Lombardi, who started 12 grands prix in the 1970s. Lombardi made history while driving with March at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the only woman to register a point-scoring finish in a grand prix.","Williams signs Susie Wolff, F1's second female driver in last month .

"(CNN) -- Years before Jerry Sandusky was charged with child sexual abuse, a psychologist told Penn State police in 1998 that the former assistant football coach acted the way a pedophile might. In her assessment, Alycia Chambers described her involvement in a case in which the mother of a young boy reported that Sandusky had showered with her son and may have had inappropriate contact with him. A redacted version of that evaluation was published Saturday by NBC News. ""My consultants agree that the incidents meet all of our definitions, based on experience and education, of a likely pedophile's pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch, within a context of a 'loving,' 'special' relationship,"" Chambers wrote. The assessment could be significant because it suggests the university was warned about Sandusky, in no uncertain terms, as early as 1998, but did not stop the alleged abuse. Sandusky, a longtime defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, is currently under house arrest as he awaits trial on more than 50 counts of child sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty. Former school officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz are charged with perjury and failure to report a crime in relation to the investigation. In addition to Chambers' evaluation, NBC News released a 1998 campus police report tied to the same sexual misconduct allegations against Sandusky. It described a second evaluation conducted by John Seasock, identified as another psychologist. Like Chambers, he spoke to the child in question about what transpired between him and Sandusky. He went into the interview cold, and reported he found no indication of child abuse. ""Seasock said that he hadn't heard of a 52-year-old becoming a pedophile,"" the report read. In an e-mail to CNN, Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general, declined comment on the 1998 assessment and differing opinions. Penn State rejected a CNN public records request for a copy of the 1998 police report in December. Amy Elizabeth McCall, an assistant general counsel, asserted in a letter to CNN then that Penn State is ""a state-related institution"" and not a ""state school"" like some in other states, and therefore does not have the same public records requirements as other public institutions. ""Because the 1998 investigation did not result in any criminal charges, it is not criminal history information and the university's police are thus required by law to keep that information within the police department,"" McCall wrote. According to a grand jury's report released in early November, the mother of one of Sandusky's accusers -- identified as Victim 6 -- came forward and said the coach had showered with her son and hugged him. Two campus police detectives eavesdropped on conversations in May 1998 when the mother confronted the coach, who retired a year later from the Nittany Lion program. Police later monitored a second conversation that month, in which the mother told Sandusky to stay away from her son. ""I understand. I was wrong,"" Sandusky said, according to the grand jury report. ""I wish I could get forgiveness. I know I won't get it from you. I wish I were dead."" No charges were ever filed in that instance, and local and state law enforcement authorities did not look deeper into those and other allegations against Sandusky until years later. Howard Janet, attorney for Victim 6, released a statement soon after news of the report broke on Saturday, blasting Penn State for failing to take action. ""Why was a second opinion sought from someone with a connection to Jerry Sandusky? Why were reports of inappropriate contact between Sandusky and young boys on the Penn State campus and Penn state activities consistently ignored?"" ""Much of the evidence coming to light points to a conspiracy of silence surrounding Sandusky's behavior at the expense of children,"" he wrote. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","The assessment and a police report were released Saturday by NBC News .

"(CNN) -- Funk fans started each Chuck Brown concert with a chant, ""Wind me up, Chuck."" From there they would be treated to guitar riffs, driving percussion and other rhythm instruments that left them dancing to the beat. Brown, who died Wednesday at 75, was the ""Godfather of Go-Go,"" a genre blending funk, jazz and soul and other musical forms. ""Go-Go,"" 40 years after its founding, remains especially popular in its hometown of Washington, D.C. ""The groove and vibe he created was unparalleled,"" said manager Tom Goldfogle. ""All of his performances were a journey with the audience."" Brown engaged in a call-and-response dialogue with fans, ensuring their interaction with each set. He last performed in early March and had been hospitalized for about four weeks. Brown died of multiple-organ failure from sepsis at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Goldfogle said. With the Soul Searchers, Brown had a big hit in the 1970s with ""Bustin' Loose."" The guitarist and singer was a familiar figure on stage with his brim hat and sunglasses, creating ""the beat"" for dancers. ""Go-Go"" referred to a sound continuing from one song to the next. ""Chuck would describe it as nonstop percussive bass music with its roots in Latin, African and funk,"" said Goldfogle. ""He added his blues and jazz elements."" While Brown performed worldwide, his most loyal fan base was in Washington. District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray, in a tweet, paid tribute to the gravel-voiced Brown. ""What a loss,"" his message concluded. Fans gathered Wednesday evening at the recently restored Howard Theatre in Washington to celebrate Brown's life. A local radio station played music while people danced in the street. Brown competed with disco and later had an influence on local hip-hop artists, Goldfogle told CNN. ""They would do hip-hop songs with a 'Go-Go' feel,"" he said. In 2010, Brown received his first Grammy nomination, in collaboration with Jill Scott and Marcus Miller, for ""Love."" A 2007 album, ""We're About the Business,"" included the singles ""Block Party"" and Chuck Baby."" Brown, according to his manager, played to several generations. ""His music is loved as much by the grandmother, as the mother, or the daughter,"" Goldfogle said. According to CNN affiliate WJLA, Brown had recently postponed numerous shows due to failing health. Funeral arrangements were pending. ""His family continues to be grateful for the outpouring of love and support and requests respect for their privacy during this difficult time,"" Goldfogle said in a statement. Survivors include Brown's wife, Jocelyn, sons Nekos, Wiley and Bill, and daughter Takesa. CNN's Jane Caffrey and Skip Nocciolo contributed to this report.","Manager speaks about Brown's influence .

"(CNN) -- Russell Westbrook's impressive 43 points were not enough to end the Oklahoma City Thunder's losing streak in game four of this year's NBA finals. They lost 104-98, their third-straight loss against the Miami Heat. The Thunder, who went into the game down two in the best-of-seven series, looked like a team determined to make a comeback, surging to a quick lead that topped out at 17 points in the first quarter. However, the Heat brought the game to within three by the half and never looked back -- thanks mainly to the influential LeBron James. James, who had 26 points and 12 assists, sat out the final minutes of the game with a cramp in his quadriceps. But he went to the bench only after sinking a momentum-changing three-pointer to put the Heat up 97-94. ""The ball was swung to me ... I just wanted to step up and make a play with the limited mobility that I had,"" James told reporters after the game, in quotes carried by NBA.com. ""My teammates were able to close it from there."" The Heat were also aided by point guard Mario Chalmers, who put up 25 points in his 34 minutes of play. Up to this point, Chalmers has been noticeably quite in the series, scoring only two points in game three. ""I think they kind of forgot about me and let me roam a little bit more tonight,"" Chalmers said of his repeated opportunities to pull up and shoot. But Chalmers is known for coming up big when it counts the most. ""He's done it time and time again in big games in college, big games in the pros,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""You can't teach that. He gave us a lift tonight that we really needed."" Again, the final minutes of play were defined by mistakes on the part of Oklahoma City. With less than 20 seconds remaining on the clock, Westbrook fouled Chalmers, despite the fact that only five seconds remained on the shot clock. ""It was just a mis-communication on my part,"" Westbrook told reporters after the game. ""Nothing I can do about it now."" When asked about whether his performance vindicated himself in anyway after being hit hard by media over the off-season, Westbrook didn't mince words in saying none of it mattered. ""What you guys say doesn't make me happy or make me sad,"" he said. ""It's not me against the world. It's me and my teammates trying to win."" The fifth game of the series tips off Thursday in Miami.","Miami Heat defeated Oklahoma City Thunder 104-98 to go up 3-1 in NBA Finals .

"(CNN) -- Military leaders and a group of political parties in Guinea-Bissau have announced the formation of a Transitional National Council after a recent coup plunged the African country into deeper chaos. The announcement came after a group of 22 mostly opposition political parties met with the military command on Sunday. The composition of the transitional council will be determined following another meeting Monday, TNC spokesman Fernando Vaz said. The president of the council will be the interim president of the country until parliamentary and presidential elections are held, Vaz said. The formation of the TNC effectively means that the Constitution will be suspended -- a scenario similar to events in 2003, after a coup against then-President Kumba Iala. And pending approval by the group on Monday, the council ""will dissolve all institutions, including the national parliament,"" the spokesman said. Also on Monday, members of the TNC's ""diplomatic commission"" will meet a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) regional bloc -- the first meeting between the junta and an international group. In a statement released Monday, ECOWAS stressed its ""zero tolerance for power obtained by unconstitutional means."" ""The delegation will reaffirm ECOWAS' rejection of the coup, which has been widely condemned by the international community ... and impress on the junta to restore constitutional rule immediately,"" the group said. Guinea-Bissau is a member state of ECOWAS. A chorus of world leaders have denounced last week's coup, which occurred just before the second round of a presidential election set for April 29. Coups and coup attempts are common in Guinea-Bissau since it won its independence from Portugal in 1974. In the latest coup, soldiers took Acting President Raimundo Pereira and Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr. into custody Thursday night, sparking international condemnation. Both leaders are well and alive, said Daba Naualna, a spokesman for the army's chief of staff. He said a group called the military command was behind the arrests, though it was unclear who its members are. Leaders of the nation's armed forces have taken control of the nation to ensure stability, according to the spokesman. ""The (army chief of staff) thinks, for the sake of the country, that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have (the military) play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis,"" he said. On Sunday, the ""military command"" announced the closure of Guinea-Bissau to all air traffic and maritime circulation from abroad as a matter ""of national security and safeguard of the territory of Guinea-Bissau."" The African Union, the United Nations and the United States called for a return to civilian rule and demanded the release of the leaders. Foreign ministers from the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries -- a group which Guinea-Bissau is a member of -- have also condemned the coup. In a statement, the military command said the revolt was in response to a ""secret deal"" between the government and Angola. This ""deal"" was drawn up to allow Angolan troops in the country to attack Guinea-Bissau's military, a communique from the group said. This group says the acting president and the prime minister signed the deal and also accuses the African Union -- whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola -- of supporting intervention by Angolan forces. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by several military coups, and these conflicts have ravaged its infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world. The nation's first round of voting in a presidential election was held in March, and campaigning for the second round was about to begin. The election was prompted by the death of the incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha in January after a long illness. Residences of the prime minister and some government ministers were looted, witnesses said. Public media outlets are under the control of the army and are regularly broadcasting statements from the military, witnesses said Friday. Angola, also a former Portuguese colony, issued a statement last week saying it would unilaterally withdraw its troops. A number of Angolan troops are in the country to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said. Sanha had become president in September 2009 after the assassination of his predecessor. Despite his coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full, five-year term.

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman should only be prosecuted if, after an exhaustive investigation and an honest assessment of Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, special prosecutor Angela Corey concludes that there is a strong possibility of proving his guilt at trial for the killing of Trayvon Martin. No American should ever be prosecuted for any crime as a consequence of the demands of a crowd, however large or vocal. This core principle of justice should stand regardless of the facts of a case or the radioactivity of a defendant. The justice system, fragile at best, is imperiled when prosecutorial decisions are tied to politics. That said, good prosecutors should vigorously pursue cases when justice demands, even and maybe especially, when there are legal impediments. To do less, especially in a homicide case, is to create one of society's greatest miscarriages: the failure to hold accountable someone who acted culpably to take the life of another. The victim's life must be vindicated. Unfortunately, some prosecutors find themselves legally paralyzed by complex cases or shrink from pursuing matters that are not air tight. Unless there are clear legal red lights at the outset, successful prosecution frequently means stretching existing laws to achieve just ends. This means arguing at trial, and on appeal, that someone like Zimmerman can be brought to justice notwithstanding Florida's strong self defense law, or that the law should be construed less favorably to those who resort to deadly force. In many self defense cases, the defendant can and does argue that the case should revolve around the uncertain moments of terror faced when he was confronted by an assailant, and that everyone in the court room is after-the-fact quarterbacking. The outcome of cases is determined by comparing the defendant's actions against state law. In no part of the country is a person threatened with death or serious physical injury required to suffer the first blow. A person can be found to have acted justifiably and reasonably for killing an unarmed person depending on the circumstances. Opinion: Without protests, justice for Trayvon Martin can't be served . Florida authorizes deadly force ""if the danger could be avoided only"" by using it, but does not require a threatened person to try first to flee. In states with more restrictive self defense rules, deadly force is only an option if someone subjected to an attack can't escape with complete safety. In Florida and elsewhere, however, even if someone is an aggressor, he can regain the right to use self defense if he withdraws from the confrontation that he initiated. Thus, a major challenge for the prosecution team in the Martin case may be the version of events that Zimmerman offers. In his account, the first face-to-face encounter with Trayvon Martin was occasioned when the teenager approached him and said, ""You got a problem?"" as Zimmerman was walking away. It is imperative for the state to emphasize evidence that the defendant is not justified in his killing and discredit or explain all contradictory evidence. Witness statements will have to be parsed with great care, especially where they appear to support Zimmerman's version of events. The prosecution should also make sure that the defendant cannot introduce into the minds of the jurors something that is so off-putting that it gives rise to doubt about the propriety of the defendant's intentions and actions. Even though the state has a lode of evidence, including vitally important 911 tapes that can offer a unique window into the motives of Zimmerman on that fateful night, it needs to be mindful of the narrative of fear that will be told by the defense counsel. (The Florida gated community has seen a number of crimes, Zimmerman was acting as a good citizen by being a neighborhood watch member, Martin is a powerfully built teenager, etc.) The defense will no doubt also exploit any lack of thoroughness in the police and forensic investigation as a bungled rush to judgment that can unsettle the minds of jurors who might otherwise be horrified by the shooting. To convict Zimmerman, a jury would have to find that there is no reasonable view of the evidence that would justify his lethal actions. Of course, the state's star witness, Trayvon Martin, is unavailable to them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eugene O'Donnell.","Eugene O'Donnell: Prosecutor needs to see if Zimmerman can be proven guilty .
O'Donnell: No American should ever be prosecuted for a crime because of demands of crowds .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan's chances of retaining their Serie A took a knock on Saturday as they went down to a shock 2-1 defeat to Fiorentina in the San Siro. The loss was capitalized on by nearest rivals Juventus who beat Palermo 2-0 in the evening kick-off to return to the top of the table. Two second-half goals, the first by centre-back Leonardo Bonucci in the 56th minute and Fabio Quagliarella 13 minutes later, mean Juve go one point clear. Earlier, Brazilian-born striker Amauri fired home in the 89th minute to seal a dramatic win for the Fiorentina. Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring for Milan in the 31st minute, stroking home from the penalty spot after Maxi Lopez was fouled by Matija Nastastic. But Fiorentina responded with a goal of their own two minutes after the break when Lorenzo Di Silvestri played in Stevan Jovetic who shot past goalkeeper Christain Abbiati. Amauri's late winner sees Fiorentina move up to 15th place. The defeat caps a disappointing week for Milan after they were eliminated from the Champions League by Barcelona on Tuesday. The only bright spot on Saturday was the return of Antonio Cassano to the team following heart surgery. ""We need to accept the result in the knowledge that there are still a lot of matches left (seven) and everything is still wide open,"" said Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri. ""It's been a bad week with the defeat to Barcelona and this one but we have to regroup because there's still everything to play for,"" he added. ""We have to stay calm, we didn't expect to stumble here but we have to be even more fired up because of what we've wasted."" A 3-1 win for Udinese against Parma sees them move up into fourth ahead of Napoli who went down to a 3-1 defeat at third-placed Lazio. Ghana midfielder Kwadwo Asamoah opened the scoring moments before the break with skipper Antonio Di Natale netting a second 11 minutes into the second half. Parma pulled a goal back when Alessandro Lucarelli scored six minutes from time but Asamoah was on hand to grab his second of the match in injury time to make sure of the three points. Sixth-placed Roma's bid for Champions League football next season was dented by a 4-2 defeat at relegation-threatened Lecce. Inter Milan now trail Roma by two points after they grabbed a point in a 2-2 draw at Cagliari. Cagliari were twice in front in the game thanks to goals from Daniele Astori and Mauricio Pinilla in the either half. But goals Diego Milito and latterly from Esteban Cambiasso earned a draw for Inter.","Serie A leaders AC Milan shocked in San Siro as Fiorentina win 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- A man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform shot at coalition service members in eastern Afghanistan Friday, killing one, officials said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force did not say which country the deceased soldier was from. But a local police chief in Kunar province said the deceased soldier was an American. It is unclear whether the attacker is an Afghan soldier or an infiltrator wearing the uniform. Police said the attacker was an Afghan soldier. But the Taliban said the attacker was part of the Taliban and had infiltrated in order to attack foreign soldiers, said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the militant group. The problem of Afghan troops who have turned their weapons on allied forces -- so-called green on blue attacks -- has intensified this year. In March, Gen. John Allen, the commander of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, said ""an erosion of trust that has emerged from this,"" but said that the systems the Afghans and ISAF have in place to help stop these attacks before they happen is having an effect. Allen said ISAF officials are working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force, and the Afghans ""have taken a lot of steps themselves."" The attacker was able to escape after the shootings, police said.","The incident occurs in eastern Afghanistan .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Some English people have resorted to pulling out their own teeth because they cannot find -- or cannot afford -- a dentist, a major study has revealed. Six percent of those surveyed in an English study said they had resorted to dental ""self-treatment."" Six percent of those questioned in a survey of 5,000 patients admitted they had resorted to self-treatment using pliers and glue, the UK's Press Association reported. England has a two-tier dental care system with some dentists offering publicly subsidized treatment through the National Health Service and others performing more expensive private work. But more than three-quarters of those polled said they had been forced to pay for private treatment because they had been unable to find an NHS dentist. Almost a fifth said they had refused dental treatment because of the cost. One respondent in Lancashire, northern England, claimed to have extracted 14 of their own teeth with a pair of pliers. In Liverpool, one of those collecting data for the survey interviewed three people who had pulled out their own teeth in one morning. ""I took most of my teeth out in the shed with pliers. I have one to go,"" another respondent wrote. Others said they had fixed broken crowns using glue to avoid costly dental work. Valerie Halsworth, 64, told British television's GMTV she had removed seven of her own teeth using her husband's pliers when her toothache became unbearable and she was unable to find an NHS dentist willing to treat her. Halsworth admitted that the first extraction had been ""excruciatingly painful."" But she added: ""It got that painful that I just had to do something... When you have taken a tooth out... the pain has gone."" Sharon Grant, chair of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, which commissioned the survey, said: ""These findings indicate that the NHS dental system is letting many patients down very badly.

"Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN) -- A former aide to John Edwards testified Thursday about an unexpected pronouncement from a campaign videographer: She and the presidential candidate were in love. But Edwards later told him he was not in a relationship with Rielle Hunter, John Davis said. ""He told me she was crazy and that he denied there was an affair,"" according to Davis. The assistant said he took Edwards at his word. Jurors on Thursday also heard from an interior designer who served as the conduit for hundreds of thousands of dollars of alleged coverup money from a wealthy Edwards benefactor. Bryan Huffman testified that neither he nor the donor knew that the money was to be used to conceal Edwards' extramarital affair with his mistress. Prosecutors say Edwards broke federal law by accepting about $725,000 from heiress Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon and more than $200,000 from Fred Baron, a now-deceased Texas lawyer who was his finance chairman. The money was used to pay for Hunter's living and medical expenses, travel and accommodations to keep the mistress out of sight while Edwards made his second White House run in 2008, prosecutors say. Edwards is accused of hiding the money from the public and the Federal Election Commission, which polices political contributions, by filing false and misleading campaign disclosure reports. Davis' testimony was the latest from Edwards staffers about their former boss's relationship with Hunter. Edwards, who was married at the time, eventually admitted to having carried on an affair with the woman and fathering her child. A former campaign staffer said Thursday that Edwards flatly refused to sign a document in December 2007, under penalty of perjury, declaring that he was not the father of Hunter's child. Mark Kornblau testified Edwards had been told that if he signed the affidavit, the National Enquirer might consider not running a story about his affair with Hunter. Legal experts say that by refusing to sign the document, Edwards demonstrated that while he was willing to lie in public about the affair, he was not willing, in this instance, to break the law. Prosecutors reacted with surprise to the testimony, asking the witness why he never told them about this in pretrial interviews. Kornblau's response: Prosecutors never asked about the matter. Davis, the former aide, testified he was surprised to see Hunter at a Detroit hotel in February 2007 because he thought her work as videographer had been completed. The two exchanged pleasantries in the lobby. Davis said he rode the elevator for a few floors with Hunter before getting off to avoid a longer ride with her. ""I would have preferred not to have seen her,"" Davis testified. Minutes later, Hunter knocked on his door. Hunter, according to Davis, ""told me that she and Sen. Edwards were very much in love"" and the candidate was concerned because Davis had seen Hunter in the hotel. The aide testified he told Hunter that ""I did not care about this because I was focused on the campaign."" Davis also testified about a phone conservation involving Edwards after a September 2007 appearance on CNN. Edwards was talking with a woman whose voice sounded like Hunter's, according to Davis. Edwards asked the woman on the phone, ""Can you tell if you are showing?"" the witness said. Earlier testimony indicated Hunter believed she became pregnant in early May 2007. Davis also suggested that Edwards came close to pulling out of the race after an argument with his wife, Elizabeth Edwards, who has since died. The candidate instructed Davis to pull together a conference call in which Edwards was to announce he was suspending his campaign. But Elizabeth Edwards canceled the call, according to Davis. Thursday afternoon's testimony featured Huffman, the interior designer from Monroe, North Carolina. Huffman, a longtime friend of Mellon, said he understood money was welcomed because ""Mr. Edwards needed financial support for a poverty center."" Mellon also saw Edwards as a possible presidential candidate when she started making the payments, Huffman said. In all, Mellon who will turn 102 in August, gave $725,000 for something Huffman said she knew nothing about: Payment for Hunter's expenses. Huffman suggested Mellon didn't consider her donations as specifically intended for the campaign. The witness elicited a laugh from the courtroom audience when he admitted that Mellon said she knew individual contribution limits the 2008 election cycle but that Mellon considered the limits ""a little low."" In 2008, the Federal Election Commission limited an individual to a contribution of $2,300 to each candidate or candidate committee in the primary election and $2,300 in the general election. See contribution limits for 2007-2008 . Huffman, who said he never took any of the money for himself, talked about how the payments were made. He described the process for getting cash to one of Edwards' key staffers, Andrew Young, as a ""furniture business."" Mellon wrote several checks payable to Huffman ostensibly for a table, chairs and a bookcase. Huffman said he signed the checks, but instead of cashing them, he handed them over to the family of Andrew Young, the prosecution's star witness. Young's wife, Cheri, endorsed the checks, but signed her maiden name. Mellon didn't want her lawyer to find out about the checks because he was always on the lookout for examples of Mellon giving away too much money, according to Huffman, who said the whole thing ""just didn't feel correct."" Cheri Young testified Monday that Edwards told her that using money from one of his benefactors to pay his mistress's expenses was legal. Young said that she felt ""disgusted"" after being asked to endorse and deposit checks from Mellon. Edwards' attorneys have said that Andrew Young was involved in a ruse to extract hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors for his personal use. The defense argues that the money Edwards received from Mellon and Baron was for personal reasons: to protect Elizabeth and his family from public humiliation. Edwards has said his actions were wrong but insisted that they were not illegal.","Interior designer Bryan Huffman testifies about money handling .

"(CNN) -- On the surface, a fast-growing service called Bit.ly performs a small task: it shortens URLs. Short URLs are booming thanks to social network tools like Twitter with character limits. That's useful when you want to share links on social networking sites like Twitter that limit the size of your messages, which helps explain why URL shortening services in general are proliferating. There are now well over a hundred. But Bit.ly, a startup that's part of the New York-based incubator Betaworks, goes further than many of its peers. In addition to short links, it offers free analytics on the traffic related to those links. And it has bigger plans in store. With little effort, regular users can see -- in real time -- the number of clicks received by their Bit.ly link, the location of the person clicking, and the service used at the time of the click (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Launched about a year ago, Bit.ly is now being used to shorten 8 to 10 million links a day, according to general manager Andrew Cohen. There are plenty of other web analytics offerings, of course, but they tend to target more technical users or, as with Google Analytics, marketers. ""You don't need a tech team to use Bit.ly,"" said Cohen. ""It's a tool that's immediately accessible to regular people."" A few months ago, Twitter quietly replaced TinyURL, one of the early shorteners, with Bit.ly as its default. There are now rumors that Twitter will buy Bit.ly outright, but Cohen won't comment on rumors. Bit.ly benefits from the Twitter arrangement on multiple levels. There's all the traffic, of course, and the demand created in the first place by the 140-character limit. More broadly, the growth of Twitter and other social networking sites means more people are communicating one-to-many -- or, in essence, acting like broadcasters. And as do broadcasters, many wonder how widely their message is being received. That favors tools that give regular users statistical feedback on the ""audience."" Other ventures are tapping into this. Fast-growing Squarespace, which helps users build blogs and web sites, offers real-time visitor stats for each page. And tr.im, another URL shortener, also offers statistics on things like a user's location, referring web sites, and the number of clicks received. But Bit.ly is perhaps more interesting for where it's going. About 200 million Bit.ly links are clicked on in a typical week, and the number is growing fast (it's doubled over the past few months). That kind of volume can yield analysis that's relevant to the Web at large. The startup detected, for instance, that the video of Iranian protestor Neda Agha-Soltan would become news well before reports came out in newspapers and on TV, according to Cohen. It was apparent, he notes, from the increasing velocity with which the video was being shared. The company is working on a series of projects -- internally dubbed ""Bit.ly Now"" -- that will help users predict and rank popular content. Among them is an upcoming web site that might compete with services like Digg and StumbleUpon. With those sites, and others like them, content is ranked by user votes. Vote-based services, though, have been gamed in the past so that something is made to appear more popular than it actually is. A click-based system might have advantages in this regard, but Cohen's team is looking at ways to strengthen the system against such attempts. Bit.ly is still exploring business models, but one thing it won't do, according to Cohen, is inject advertisements when users click on a link. ""Early on, we made a decision never to frame content, and never to run interstitial advertising,"" he said. ""Everything we do has to go with the grain of the product and community."" That's not stopping others, though. A service called Tweetbucks, which works with Bit.ly and TinyURL links, entices users to ""shorten any URL and make money."" The service will pay Twitter users who get followers to click on a short URL and then either interact with framed ads or make purchases at supported merchants. That's just one example of opportunistic middlemen taking advantage of shortened URLs. Fraudsters have been targeting Twitter with links that are supposedly related to trending topics but that actually lead to malicious sites. Bit.ly is taking a few approaches to combat this. It uses real-time spam-filtering services, like SURBL and Google Safe Browsing, so that if you are directed to such a site, a warning will pop up warning you about it. Earlier this week, Twitter itself started to offer similar warnings, but not for shortened URLs. Bit.ly also offers a browser plug-in that can reveal the full URL. Another company offers a useful browser add-on for Firefox called Hyperwords. It's added full-URL-reveal to its long list of capabilities, and it works for most (though not all) brands of shortened URL. Bit.ly and others, including tr.im, let outside applications tap their application programming interfaces (API), so one thing they can do is offer full URL preview in their own programs. For instance with TweetDeck, a popular app for organizing tweets, you can see the full URL behind a Bit.ly link. Whatever improvements Bit.ly and its peers make, there will likely remain some Internet users who largely avoid short URLs for reasons of their own. ""I rarely click on Bit.ly links,"" commented one reader of the social media blog Mashable.com. ""Just not comfy with the big brother-ish tracking stuff."" Interestingly, she didn't mind if it was Google doing the tracking. She minded if it was somebody she knew, like a business associate -- even though the data is anonymous. Some things, like the quirks of human psychology, can probably never be addressed.","Shortened URL services growing in popularity thanks to services like Twitter .

"New York (CNN) -- A would-be terrorist, who previously confessed to planning a subway suicide bomb attack, described in court on Tuesday how he and two high school friends planned to wreak havoc in New York City. Najibullah Zazi, the mastermind of the 2009 plot, testified Tuesday against alleged co-conspirator Adis Medunjanin, who is the sole member of trio on trial. The third man in the group, Zerein Ahmedzay, had earlier pleaded guilty in the plot. Medunjanin, a Bosnian immigrant who traveled with the two friends to Pakistan where they allegedly sought terrorist training, is among those accused of devising the scheme. ""What makes this plot stand out is it's alleged it was an al Qaeda plot that went right to the top levels of the al Qaeda terrorist organization,"" said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank, who said U.S. law enforcement only caught on to the scheme ""late in the day."" Zazi testified Tuesday that Medunjanin had provided him with audio recordings of terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki promoting jihad. He testified that he wanted to enlist in the Taliban ""before they win and America leaves, I should go and be a part of it."" ""My understanding was they wanted me to carry out a martyrdom operation,"" Zazi testified. The three initially resisted, he said. ""We talked amongst ourselves, looked at each other and said no,"" only to later begin their planning. During opening statements Monday, a federal prosecutor described Medunjanin as an ""al Qaeda terrorist,"" an assertion the defense said was ""just wrong."" Prosecutors allege Medunjanin and the two others eventually hatched a plan to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up on New York subway stations. Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan, and Zazi, an immigrant from Pakistan, have already pleaded guilty to the same charges. February 2010: Zazi pleads guilty in plot . ""In September of 2009, three men were prepared to strap bombs to their bodies and go into crowded subways,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney James Loonam told jurors in his opening statement Monday. ""These men were al Qaeda terrorists,"" Loonam claimed. Angry at the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, the three went to Pakistan's tribal belt -- ""the center of al Qaeda activity against the United States"" -- to join the terrorist group, according to Loonam. Once there, the federal prosecutor said, the men were given ""special treatment"" and ""private training by al Qaeda"" because of their coveted status as U.S. citizens. In his opening statement, defense attorney Robert Gottlieb accused the prosecution of using incendiary rhetoric to inflame the jury. ""These are all words the government knows will scare you beyond belief and shake you to the core,"" Gottlieb said of terms such as ""terrorist"" and ""al Qaeda."" ""The truth is Adis Medunjanin is not a terrorist. ... In this case, the government is just wrong."" Later Monday, Ahmedzay took the stand and described how his former high school classmate Medunjanin turned him on to the teaching of al-Awlaki. The American-born Muslim cleric was targeted and killed in a September 2011 drone attack in Yemen. Medunjanin's trial is expected to last three weeks.","Accused terrorist Adis Medunjanin's trial continues with a key witness .

"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) -- The campaign of Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney tried Wednesday to put the best possible spin on Super Tuesday's mixed verdict, releasing a memo arguing that it is now nearly impossible for his opponents to catch him in the delegate hunt. ""Super Tuesday dramatically reduced the likelihood that any of Gov. Romney's opponents can obtain the Republican nomination,"" said Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director. ""As Gov. Romney's opponents attempt to ignore the basic principles of math, the only person's odds of winning they are increasing are President Obama's."" According to CNN's latest delegate count, Romney now has 404 delegates, compared with 165 for Rick Santorum, 106 for Newt Gingrich and 66 for Ron Paul. To claim the nomination, a candidate will need 1,144 delegates when Republicans meet for their national convention in Tampa this summer. None of Romney's opponents ""succeeded in closing (the) delegate deficit"" Tuesday, and ""the calendar ahead offers them dwindling opportunities to close the gap,"" Beeson said. He called Super Tuesday a ""one-time opportunity"" to reshape the race. Among other things, Beeson said that there are now few major delegate prizes remaining and that most of the states yet to vote have rules requiring a proportional allocation of delegates -- a reality that makes it hard to narrow Romney's lead. Santorum and Gingrich have argued otherwise, insisting there is still an anti-Romney majority within the Republican Party that can unify in the weeks ahead. Next on the calendar: Kansas holds its caucuses Saturday, followed by contests in Alabama, Mississippi, and Hawaii on Tuesday. Several U.S. territories will also have the chance to weigh in over the next week, including Guam, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa. Romney substantially increased his delegate lead on Super Tuesday but failed by most accounts to deliver a knockout blow. He squeezed out a razor-thin popular vote win in the bellwether state of Ohio, while also carrying his home state of Massachusetts, plus Idaho, Vermont, Virginia and Alaska. Santorum won North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee, while Gingrich cruised to victory in his home state of Georgia. Paul failed to win in any of the states up for grabs. Complete Super Tuesday results . Romney was aided by his opponents' organizational failures. Santorum failed to meet the eligibility requirements for a number of delegates up for grabs in Ohio, and neither Santorum nor Gingrich qualified for the Virginia ballot. Despite his opponents' problems, however, Romney still demonstrated significant weakness with elements of the Republican base. Evangelical voters, Southerners, strong tea party backers and rural residents continued to largely reject the former Massachusetts governor's candidacy. A substantial number of voters also indicated concern that Romney -- a wealthy former venture capitalist -- cannot adequately relate to their daily struggles. In exit polls, 34% of Ohio voters said Santorum best understands the problems of average Americans, compared with only 22% for Romney. Opinion: Why can't Romney win big? Romney -- generally perceived as more moderate than Santorum or Gingrich -- ""still has a problem with the base,"" said Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor who was press secretary for President George W. Bush. ""That base problem may make him attractive to independents if he gets to a general"" election, but can work against the former governor in the primary season. Santorum loses among Ohio Catholics . For their part, Santorum's and Gingrich's campaigns have high hopes for upcoming contests in the more conservative Southern and Plains states. Santorum's camp plans to buy about $1 million of ads in Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi, a source with the campaign told CNN. Santorum's victory in Tennessee hurt Gingrich's strategy in the South after the former House speaker's triumphs in South Carolina and now Georgia. ""It looks we're going to get at least a couple of gold medals, and a whole passel full of silver medals,"" Santorum told cheering supporters in Ohio before the outcome in the Buckeye State was known. Santorum stumps his naysayers . For Gingrich, who represented Georgia's Sixth Congressional District for two decades, the home state victory provided a new boost after a string of defeats. Check in on the Political Ticker . ""Thank you Georgia! It is gratifying to win my home state so decisively to launch our March Momentum,"" Gingrich said Tuesday night in a Twitter post. ""There's lots of bunny rabbits that run through,"" he later told supporters in Georgia, referring to the earlier revolving door of front-runners in the GOP nomination fight. ""I'm the tortoise."" Gingrich vows to keep plugging away . A Gingrich campaign source told CNN on condition of not being identified that the former House speaker will become the third GOP candidate to get Secret Service protection starting Wednesday. Romney and Santorum already have that protection. Romney entered Super Tuesday off of three wins last week and a growing lead in the race for the right to face off against President Barack Obama in November. In remarks to supporters in Boston, Romney sounded like the presumptive GOP nominee, focusing his attention on the president. iReport: Why can't Romney seal the deal? Citing national unemployment that remains above 8%, Romney said the figure is just an ""inconvenient statistic"" in the eyes of the Obama administration. ""But those numbers are more than data on a spreadsheet; they are worried families and anxious faces,"" said Romney, who was interrupted repeatedly by chants and cheers. ""And tonight, I'd like to say to each of them: You have not been forgotten. We will not leave you behind. Our campaign is on the move, and real change is finally on the way."" Photos from Super Tuesday . Romney also signaled a continued battle for his campaign. ""Tonight we've taken one more step towards restoring the promise of America,"" he said. ""Tomorrow we wake up and we start again. And the next day we'll do the same. And so it will go, day by day, step by step, door by door, heart to heart."" Santorum also focused on Obama, saying the president's policies threatened the individual liberty of Americans. But he targeted Romney as well for his health care law in Massachusetts, arguing it was the model for Obama's federal health care reforms detested by conservatives. ""I've never been for a mandate at a state or a federal level,"" Santorum said in challenging the requirement in both the Massachusetts and federal laws for people to have health coverage.

Despite lingering concerns about Romney's conservative credentials on health care and other issues, the former governor's campaign was bolstered by endorsements from several leading conservatives this week, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia; Oklahoma Sen.

"(CNN) -- As events continue to unfold in Syria, the future of this Arab nation remains unknown. There are many questions. Will the regime of President Bashar al-Assad eventually fall? If so, what kind of leadership would replace al-Assad? If not, would al-Assad's style of governance change? The answers will have a major impact on Syria's neighbors and the Middle East. It's a complicated web of affairs, laced with deep historical, political and religious ties. There are several factors to consider: Syria's relationships with Iran and Hezbollah; its presence in neighboring Lebanon, a country struggling to maintain a delicate balance among its religious and ethnic sects; and the roles of Gulf Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. We asked four people to share their thoughts on the connection between Syria and the current state of affairs in the region, posing the question: ""What kind of impact do the events in Syria have on the rest of the Middle East?"" Leverett: War could draw in other countries . Hillary Mann Leverett teaches foreign policy at American University in Washington. A former White House official who worked on Middle East issues, she held various roles with the State Department, the National Security Council and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. She is also co-author of the blog RaceForIran.com. The civil war in Syria is likely to prove a watershed for the Middle East's balance of power. It has the potential to become a full-blown regional war that could spill over into other countries and bring those countries into conflict, through proxies and perhaps even directly. On top of that, the temptation to arm and fund Syrian rebels could spark a great power confrontation over Syria. Russia and China have made it clear that that they oppose foreign military intervention in Syria, especially by the United States. And in Russia's case, it has made it clear that it will protect Syria, its beachhead in the Mediterranean. Russia has a longtime relationship with the country, and it has drawn a red line against U.S. intervention. Russia has sent naval assets, weapons and radar to Syria, and it could even send Russian personnel to protect it. Russia and China's approach to the Syrian conflict is very different from the posture they took toward the U.S. invasion of Iraq and Western military intervention in Libya. If you watch the Western or Gulf states' media, you would have the impression that everyone in Syria opposes and is fighting the government. This is not true. In Syria, a significant portion of the population is disaffected, but the majority still supports the regime. A series of public polls, for example, show that the al-Assad government still retains a majority of the support of the population. The reason? The basic majority, about 55% of the population, is terrified at the prospect of the other 45% forming a Sunni Islamist tyranny over the country. The 55% have held together -- as they have for decades -- to essentially hold Syria together as an independent, secular political order. There are now several countries, principally Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, France and the U.S., that have aligned themselves with the angry minority. The strategic problem for these countries is that even if rebels are militarily successful and force al-Assad from power, the new government would be one that roughly 55% of the population does not want and/or fears. This means that without a negotiated way forward, we know that the outcome of arming or supporting the rebels means -- at a minimum -- only sustained violence and instability in Syria and for the region. Tabler: 'Cold war' between Shiites, Sunnis . Andrew J. Tabler is the Next Generation fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He is also the author of ""In the Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle with Syria."" The events in Syria impact the general struggle between Iran and the Sunni-Arab alliance in the region. The minority Shiite Alawite-dominated regime in Syria is backed by Iran, and the majority of Syrians are Sunni Muslims. There is sort of a cold war taking place between the two sides. I think you can see that playing out in terms of Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey clearly on the side of the opposition in Syria, while the Iranians are strongly backing the regime. What's at stake is larger than what's within Syria's borders. Syria is a keystone of the Iranian alliance. It allows Iran to protect its power on the shores of the Mediterranean and its border with Israel, particularly its support of Hezbollah in Lebanon. And the more this violence continues, especially with the regime using brutal force, the more it enrages people in the Sunni Arab countries. Although other governments have been holding back in their support of the opposition until recently, there are many individuals in the region who will help sponsor the opposition within Syria. A lot of this is about the future of the Arab world and what the basis of these governments will be. For so long, it has been based on narrow regimes and, in the case of Syria, a narrow minority regime. Whatever comes next is likely to be a majoritarian system that has a larger base. Haddad: Interference would change the dynamics . Bassam Haddad is the director of Middle East studies at George Mason University. He is also the homepage editor of Jadaliyya, an independent online Arab affairs magazine produced by the Arab Studies Institute. Haddad wrote ""Business Networks in Syria: The Political Economy of Authoritarian Resilience."" The Syrian situation is complex like any other uprising, but the situation has added complexity because it is at the juncture of several conflicts in the region. Those struggles involve local, regional and international power plays that make the situation a lot more charged. For instance, we have Syria at the center of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Syria is part of an axis, so to speak, with Iran and Hezbollah, confronting imperialism in various forms from inside and outside the region, particularly in relation to U.S. domination and Israel's occupations and belligerence. There is also resistance to the conservative Arab camp that includes Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other conservative countries that are usually allies with the United States. Also, Syria is, in many ways, the guarantor of stability in Lebanon. Syria's presence in Lebanon has guaranteed some stability despite many violations of Lebanon's sovereignty by Syria. For all these reasons, Syria's position in the region is pivotal. This is not simply another uprising against a dictator. It is also being transformed by other players into an effort to redraw the political map of the region and curtail further protests elsewhere. A lot of the anti-regime actors and analysts are placed in an odd position. They do not support the regime or the turn that the uprising has taken since fall of last year. So perhaps the task is to build an independent opposition away from the dictates of Saudi Arabia, Qatar or the United States. Military intervention in Syria will bring in Iran and Hezbollah, and that will change the dynamic of the conflict. Most people in the region are opposed to the Syrian regime's domestic behavior during the past decades, but they are not opposed to its regional role. The problem is the Syrian regime's internal repression, not its external policies. If there is no interference from the outside, the uprisings will be seen as legitimate. If it becomes regional and you bring in the U.S. and Israel in a fight against the Syrian regime, it changes the strategic dynamics of the conflict -- and not just the players involved. Dunne: Democracy takes time . Michele Dunne is the director of the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East in Washington. Previously, she was a Middle East affairs specialist at the State Department and the White House. She also served as a diplomat in Cairo and Jerusalem. When I travel to the Middle East, it is striking how in the eastern part of the Arab world, sectarian issues are right on the surface of public discourse and shape the way people look at the uprisings. For example, the same person might support the uprising in Syria but not the one in Bahrain, or vice versa, depending on whether that person is Sunni or Shiite Muslim. There are many reasons for this, including the rise of Iran and the unleashing of sectarian sentiments in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was deposed. Sectarian feeling is less pronounced in the western part of the Arab world, which is largely populated by Sunnis. Last summer, Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states abandoned al-Assad and withdrew their ambassadors from Syria. Perhaps they did this partly because they saw how strong the popular uprising in Syria was and assessed that al-Assad might not be able to outlast it. Perhaps they also saw a chance of getting a Sunni majority government into power in Syria, which would make the Gulf states more comfortable. Probably, their desire to change the regional sectarian and political power balance has largely dictated their policies toward Syria. Certainly, Syria has been a key cog in the machine of Iran's influence in the Levant. Syria has provided the avenue through which Iran could project political influence into Lebanon and Palestine through Hezbollah and Hamas. The Hamas link with Syria has already been broken. Hamas has turned against al-Assad, partly out of support for the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and partly because Damascus is no longer a safe haven for them. Hamas is now working on closer relations with Egypt, where the Brotherhood controls close to half of the parliament, is running a candidate for president and is likely to have a strong presence in the new Cabinet. We are not going to see in any of the Arab countries a neat transition to a democracy in a year or two. Countries do not make that shift -- from authoritarianism to democracy -- so rapidly. Achieving a well-functioning democracy could happen in perhaps 10 to 15 years. There will be setbacks, bloodshed and disappointments along the way. But we have to stay with this for a while, develop sustainable strategies to help these countries, and not abandon them a year or two into their transitions. The opportunity to establish functioning democracies in the Arab world is a tremendous and historic one for the Middle East, and the risks if these transitions fail -- with all that could bring in terms of instability, safe havens for terrorists, etc. -- are also enormous. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the authors.","Whatever happens in Syria will have a major effect on its neighbors and the Middle East .

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- At least 13 people died Thursday in a fire at a prison in northern Honduras, a fire official said. Among the dead was a prisoner who was decapitated, a fire official told reporters. Video shot at the scene showed thick clouds of smoke billowing from the building. The incident comes on the heels of another prison fire in Honduras that killed more than 350 people last month. The cause of the fire at the prison in San Pedro Sula was not immediately known. Police Chief Ricardo Ramirez said shots had been heard from inside. A fire last month in the central Honduran town of Comayagua killed 358 inmates. Two previous deadly prison fires have occurred in San Pedro Sula. In 2009, 103 people were reported killed and in 2004, 107 died. Honduran prisons have been criticized for being overcrowded places with poor conditions. The International Centre for Prison Studies, citing February 2010 figures, said that the country's prisons were operating at 137.9% of capacity.","One of the dead was decapitated, a fire official says .

"London (CNN) -- Controversial breast implants made by the French company PIP do not cause cancer and are not toxic, but they do have a high rupture rate, a British Department of Health study reported Monday. The implants are ""clearly substandard,"" and are ""significantly more likely to rupture or leak silicone than other implants,"" the report found. But, the medical authorities said, studies have not shown that the implants pose ""any significant risk to human health."" An estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from the company. The implants were banned in 2010, and the company went bankrupt later that year. The implants are not approved for use in the United States. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) said Monday that all women should be offered removal of the implants. ""All providers who implanted PIPs have a responsibility to proactively share with their patients objective and up-to-date information about the risks to their health so they can make an informed decision on the removal of their implants,"" BAAPS president Fazel Fatah said. The French government said earlier this year that it would pay for the removal of PIP implants, which a British medical group says were made from ""nonmedical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses."" More than 500 French women have had the implants removed since last year, according to the French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products. Since then, more than 1,000 implants have ruptured, the agency said. German medical groups have recommended that women seek removal of the implants, saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems. The founder of the company that made the implants was jailed in March after failing to pay bail. Judge Annaick Le Goff ordered the arrest of Jean-Claude Mas, founder of Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, from his partner's home in southern France, a law enforcement official in Marseille told CNN on March 7. Mas was previously arrested on January 26 in connection with an investigation for involuntary homicide and harm following the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. He was charged with involuntary injury and not with the more serious offense of involuntary manslaughter. Mas was released but was under judicial control, meaning he could not leave France, attorney Yves Haddad said. CNN's Raja Razek and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: British plastic surgeons say all women with PIP implants should be offered their removal .

"(CNN) -- Let's face it: Barack Obama has not exactly been the second coming of Alexander the Great. He swept into office vowing to step up the war effort in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and he did, sending 30,000 fresh troops into the former and vastly expanding drone strikes in the latter. Obama managed to get Osama bin Laden, an achievement will likely be hearing about ad nauseum on the campaign trail over the long months ahead. But he hasn't realized the much more difficult goal of bringing stability to Afghanistan, a land we have now been trying to stabilize for more than a decade. The recent spectacular attacks in Kabul, in which insurgents were able to once again paralyze the capital for 24 hours, may not have been Tet II, but they did underscore just how the fragile the planned 2014 handover to Afghan control really is. Enter Mitt Romney, whose positions on Afghanistan have been all over the map. He's criticized the Obama administration for setting a timeline for withdrawal, but he has endorsed the timeline in practice. He's denounced the idea of negotiating with the Taliban but hasn't explained how he plans to defeat the insurgent movement on the battlefield. His main substantive complaint seems to be that Obama is withdrawing the surge troops by September instead of ... December. Indeed, his campaign's few pronouncements on this subject are reminiscent of Richard Nixon's ""secret plan"" to end the war in Vietnam, which turned out to be a plan to cut and run without ever admitting as much. The truth is that Romney holds more or less the same position on Afghanistan as the president -- steadily turning control over to the Afghans in the run-up to 2014, while cajoling the Pakistanis to be more cooperative -- but he just can't admit it. Politically speaking, this is a smart strategy. Poll after poll has shown that Americans simply aren't interested in spending billions of their dwindling tax dollars to prop up Hamid Karzai, a deeply unimpressive leader who appears to them as ungrateful as he is incompetent and untrustworthy. That is, to the extent that Americans still think about this long-forgotten war at all. One way or another, we're leaving Afghanistan, and I suspect we'll someday look back on the conflict and wonder just what we were doing there for so long -- why, for instance, we thought it made sense to spend more money there each year than the country's entire GDP (excluding opium production, that is), and why we thought an impoverished, land-locked strategic backwater was such an important chess piece in a new ""Great Game."" As long as Pakistan sees its interests as diametrically opposed to ours, and shelters and colludes with our enemies, this war could grind on forever. As long as Afghanistan is led by venal and weak-kneed partners, counterinsurgency is a waste of time. And nothing in the past decade suggests any of that will change on any time scale the American people will accept. None of this is to say that leaving Afghans -- especially women -- to their fates after all we've promised them is a comfortable moral decision to make. I don't envy the American officials having to explain that all the talk about saving Afghan women was just political rhetoric from a country that, at the end of the day, makes its national security decisions based on hard-nosed interests, not sentiment. But those conversations would happen under a Romney presidency just as they would under a second Obama term. We've gotten our revenge for 9/11. Bin Laden is at the bottom of the Arabian Sea, and the core of his al Qaeda network is much diminished. Karzai's government has been given an ample chance to succeed or fail on its own. As for Alexander, let's not forget -- Afghanistan was where the greatest general in history met his match. History may not be repeating itself today, but it sure does rhyme.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian hang-gliding instructor who police say swallowed a memory card possibly containing video of a fatal accident was granted bail Friday, a court spokesman said. William Jonathan Orders, 50, who was arrested and charged with obstructing justice, appeared in provincial court in Chilliwack, British Columbia. His bail was set at $5,750 (Canadian), said Neil MacKenzie, communications counsel with the province's criminal justice branch. Orders was instructed to turn over his passport and to not operate a hang glider or paraglider, he said. Lenami Godinez-Avila had just started a tandem hang-gliding flight with the instructor, when she fell from the glider, plunging hundreds of feet to her death Saturday in a heavily wooded part of western Canada, authorities say. Investigators say the instructor tried to hide what might be a key piece of evidence about what went wrong -- a possible onboard video recording of the flight -- in his digestive tract. The recording has since passed and is now in police custody, MacKenzie said. He declined comment on whether anything retrievable could be taken from the card. Calls on Thursday and Friday seeking comment from Orders' attorney, Laird Cruickshank, were not immediately returned. The fall happened near Mount Woodside, from which Orders and the 27-year-old Godinez-Avila took off, more than 50 miles east of Vancouver. A witness, Nicole McLearn, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that when the glider was in the air, Godinez-Avila appeared to be wearing her harness, but it wasn't attached to the glider. The passenger clung to Orders before she fell, McLearn said. ""He was horizontal but she was now hanging vertically, and it looked like in essence she had him in a bear hug around the chest area,"" McLearn told the CBC. ""I could see her starting to slip down his body ... past the waist, down the legs. Finally she got to the feet and tried to hang on and obviously couldn't hang on for that much longer and let go, tearing off the tandem pilot's shoes in the process,"" McLearn said. Jason Warner, safety director for the Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association of Canada, told the CBC on Sunday that he talked to Orders shortly after the incident on Saturday afternoon. ""He tried to grab her -- he tried to grab her harness, everything he could, wrapped his legs around her -- and she slipped down his legs and then fell,"" Warner told the CBC. Orders told police he had swallowed the memory card of the onboard camera, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Constable Tracy Wolbeck said. When asked whether Orders explained why he had done so, Wolbeck said she couldn't comment further on conversations he'd had with investigators. The RCMP said it and the Coroners Service of British Columbia are investigating the incident. ""She became detached from the hang glider and fell, but how she came to be detached is what we're still working on,"" said Barb McLintock, coroner with the Coroners Service of British Columbia. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","William Jonathan Orders was granted bail .

"(CNN) -- Smarting from their first back-to-back defeats in nearly three years, Barcelona are on the defensive for a change as they approach Tuesday's Champions League semifinal second leg against Chelsea. Barcelona all but surrendered the Spanish league title with Saturday's 2-1 home loss to Real Madrid that came days after a 1-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in the first leg. Barca defender Gerard Pique strongly rejected any suggestion that his club might be in the midst of a more deep-seated crisis, and that the losses could signal the beginning of the end of a glittering era. ""A team that has won 13 trophies in three and a half years deserves more credit than that,"" he said. ""Other teams need to win more championships before we start talking like that. We deserve respect."" Coach Pep Guardiola was equally bullish in his news conference before the match, even swearing as he defended his decision to play the inexperienced Cristian Tello against Madrid. Guardiola has seen his side dominate possession against both Chelsea and Madrid yet struggle to find a way to goal, with Lionel Messi failing to add to his 63 goals for the season. ""I don't know if this is the most important moment of my career as a coach,"" Guardiola said of the Chelsea game. ""But I have always faced these challenges with a lot of optimism as I believe in my players and team."" Madrid now lead the Spanish league by seven points with four games remaining, with midfielder Xavi conceding that a fourth straight title ""is practically impossible."" But Barcelona could still end the season as winners of the Champions League and Copa del Rey. The Catalans have already won the Club World Cup, the European Supercup and the Spanish Supercup. ""We'll keep fighting, because we know that it's still in our own hands to have a good season,"" Xavi said on Barcelona's official website. Chelsea haven't lost in six meetings with Barcelona and won the home leg thanks to a determined defensive display and a Didier Drogba goal just before half time. Guardiola has the option of restoring Pique to his starting lineup to combat Drogba's strength, having sprung a surprise by leaving the Spain international out of both the first leg and the game against Madrid. Pique said he isn't taking it personally. ""For me, the important issue isn't whether I play tomorrow,"" he said. ""For me, the main thing is that we win and reach the final. ""It is a new situation for me because I'm used to playing and in the last matches I have not had a chance to play. But it's a technical decision of the manager and I have to respect that."" Barcelona go into Tuesday's match having won their last 15 home matches in the Champions League. Chelsea, meanwhile, have only won once on the road in Europe this season. But Chelsea have found a unity under interim coach Roberto di Matteo that seemed to be lacking under previous manager Andre Villas Boas, and they are unbeaten in 13 of 14 matches since the Italian took charge. ""His message is clearly aimed at team spirit -- fighting,"" Chelsea striker Fernando Torres told the UEFA website. ""You have to fight and then your talent will come through afterwards. When all of that comes together, you'll overcome your opponent most of the time."" That was never more evident than in Chelsea's first leg performance. Barcelona had 72% of the possession and six shots on target. Chelsea had one -- Drogba's goal. ""Many teams who play Barcelona think that you have to steal the ball from them, but I don't think that's possible,"" Torres said. ""You have to use different weapons against them. If you want to steal the ball, you won't manage it and you'll get tired, and then create more space for your opponent."" Barcelona's last Champions League exit in 2010 came in the semifinal at the hands of Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan side, which won the first leg 3-1 before producing an ultra-defensive display at the Camp Nou to win 3-2 on aggregate. But Di Matteo said he won't send his side out to play for a goalless draw. ""The tie is half time, it's 50-50. Both teams still have the same chance to go through,"" he said. ""I do think we will have to try to score.""","Barcelona head into Champions League semifinal second leg against Chelsea trailing 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- One year ago, the world watched as a massive tsunami engulfed entire communities in northern Japan. Live television footage showed waves as high as 30 feet rushing into coastal cities, tossing around boats, cars and rooftops just an hour after one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded. ""I thought Japan would disappear,"" one elderly survivor said in the immediate aftermath. ""I thought Japan would disappear under water."" Earthquakes are not uncommon for Japan, which rests on one of the world's most active fault lines. But the one that triggered the tsunami on March 11, 2011, had a magnitude of 9.0, making it the fourth-largest earthquake in the world since 1900. ""My wife and I stood outside and basically held on to the outside of our house,"" resident Matt Alt said on the day of the quake. ""We couldn't even stand up. We have never ever felt anything on the magnitude of what we experienced today."" The videos from last year's disaster are still astonishing today. One shows a man trapped in rushing waters, desperately clinging to a telephone wire. Another shows people running away from the tsunami, barely escaping before a wall of water barrels into their homes. Many other people, however, were not so lucky. As of Friday, the official death toll was 15,854. An additional 3,167 people are still missing. The total damage from the disaster has been estimated at about 25 trillion yen, or $300 billion. ""The house you're seeing here wasn't here before,"" one man said, showing his neighborhood's damage a week after the tsunami. ""It was swept here by the wave. The houses that were here were completely washed away."" With the popularity of mobile phones in Japan, last year's tsunami was one of the most recorded natural disasters in history. Amateur videos surfaced quickly, making it easier than ever for people around the world to empathize with the victims, said Tokyo-based technology consultant Steve Nagata. ""Because you had all of this very real footage, it made the incident much more real in people's minds,"" Nagata recently told CNN's Kyung Lah. ""They no longer have to imagine what a tsunami is. They saw it live. ... To be able to do this in near real time and to do it to audiences across the globe is unprecedented."" Many people lost their homes in the tsunami but were fortunate to find shelter at nearby evacuation centers. In Ishinomaki, Japan, evacuees used old boxes to set up ""cardboard cities"" while they waited for temporary housing to be built. One of those evacuees, Yoshichi Suzuki, had a positive outlook as he stayed with his grandchildren at the shelter. Two months after the tsunami, Suzuki was nursing several plants that he had salvaged from his damaged home. ""They were washed away by the tsunami but still survived,"" he told Lah. ""And they're blooming with flowers now. ""Just like the plants, we must go on and live.""

"(CNN) -- The University of West Georgia graduate student infected with rare ""flesh-eating"" bacteria has proven to be ""amazingly resilient,"" her father said Wednesday, and a second apparent case has been reported. ""It's phenomenal the change we've seen in the past week,"" said Andy Copeland, whose 24-year-old daughter Aimee was on a ventilator in intensive care at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. ""Today, she's actually doing very well,"" he told Jane Velez-Mitchell of CNN's sister station HLN. ""She was in high spirits."" The master's student in psychology at the Carrollton school was with friends on May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a zip line. It snapped and she fell. The accident left a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, where doctors determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. She was flown to Augusta for surgery. Since then, doctors have removed part of Copeland's abdomen, amputated a leg and expect to remove her fingers, her father said. ""We're unclear if she actually knows about the leg,"" he said. ""Right now, she does know about the condition of her hands, though. She knows there has been some atrophy -- or basically a loss of blood flow in that area."" The father said there was no immediate need for surgeons to remove her fingers, which he described as being in a state of ""dry gangrene ... her fingers basically, at this point, are necrotized. It's dead flesh; they will ultimately have to be removed."" Copeland, who has been on life support since May 4, regained consciousness a week later, the school's website said. She has since undergone a tracheotomy. ""I hope it will be easier to understand her,"" said Aimee Copeland's sister Paige. Until now, the family has been playing a form of charades in an attempt to decipher her words, which the ventilator's presence has been made difficult to understand, she said. Copeland has been infused with 177 units of blood since she contracted the infection. That's more than 168 pints; the average human body contains about 10 pints of blood, according to America's Blood Centers. The bacteria are ""remarkably common in the water and in the environment,"" according to Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. He said it was not clear how many cases occur in the United States in any given year. ""For pediatrics, we only see two or three a year,"" he said, referring to Vanderbilt. ""When it gets into those deeper tissues, it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition,"" he said. ""When it does that, those tissues die, and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control."" The infection is fatal in about one in four cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. A similar if apparently less severe case was reported by the husband of a 36-year-old paramedic and nurse from Greenville, South Carolina, who gave birth to twins on May 7 at a hospital in Georgia. The couple had traveled to Atlanta because they had found there a doctor who was willing to perform a vaginal delivery even if the babies were in the breach position. Some doctors prefer to perform cesarean sections in such cases. Other than a minor tear that was sewn up and the loss of ""a lot of blood"" that required a transfusion, Lana Kuykendall's vaginal deliveries of twins Abigail and Ian were uneventful, said her husband, Darren Kuykendall, a 42-year-old firefighter. But when Lana Kuykendall failed to feel better by Thursday, she checked out of the Atlanta hospital and traveled back to Greenville. ""We discharged because we wanted to come home and see if we could get her better, because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with her,"" het said. But once she was home with her babies, Lana Kuykendall's condition worsened. On Friday morning, ""she woke up and she had a big bruise on the back of her leg and it looked like a blood clot,"" Darren Kuykendall said. ""That spot just got bigger and bigger as she laid there. Literally, you could almost watch it grow as you're standing there."" He then took his wife to Greenville Memorial Hospital. ""One of the OB doctors realized what it kind of looked like, and she went and got the surgeon, and they all made the decision that it was definitely necrotizing fasciitis, so they took her immediately to surgery,"" he said. By then, the affected tissue ""had almost encircled her leg."" In separate procedures on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, surgeons cut out dead skin and tissue from both legs to keep the infection from spreading and put her on antibiotics, said Kuykendall. ""It's hopefully on its way to healing,"" he said. ""She's sedated and on a ventilator."" Though Lana Kuykendall's organs remain in good shape, ""they told me it could still go either way,"" her husband said. Still, he added, ""she's critical, but likely she's going to be OK."" Sandy Dees, the hospital's public relations officer, could only confirm Wednesday night that her condition was critical but stable. The two doctors whom Darren Kuykendall identified as having treated his wife have not responded to requests for comment. Meanwhile, infants Abigail and Ian are in the care of family and friends, Kuykendall said.","NEW: An apparently less severe case is reported involving S.C. woman who had twins .

"Washington (CNN) -- Iran, Syria and now China. President Barack Obama faces a third front of vulnerability on his administration's record of defending human rights with the muddled situation involving activist Chen Guangcheng. With his re-election campaign just hitting full stride, Obama hoped to capitalize on foreign policy successes, such as last year's raid that killed Osama bin Laden, to blunt Republican attacks on the sluggish U.S. economic recovery. However, the increasingly strange and challenging case of Chen provides potential fresh fodder for opponents to continue their attempts to portray the Obama presidency as soft or acquiescing to brutal regimes that abuse their own people. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney led the attack Thursday, saying at a campaign event that circumstances of the incident -- if true -- meant a ""dark day for freedom, and it's a day of shame for the Obama administration."" Conservative Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona have criticized the Obama administration for not providing strong support for Iranian protesters last year or the Syrian opposition movement in its ongoing conflict with forces of President Bashar al-Assad. ""Ultimately, ending violations of conscience requires the political will and moral courage of world leaders, especially the president of the United States,"" McCain said last week. ""Unfortunately, that will and leadership are lacking in the case of Syria today."" Chen's case casts new light on China's history of political persecution and rights abuses and comes at a particularly delicate time as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner arrived this week for long-planned talks on strategic and economic issues. Chen: 'I want to go to the United States' The blind, self-taught human rights attorney has been persecuted by Chinese authorities for years for his work exposing the government's policy restricting the number of children a couple may have, mistreatment of disabled people and other abuses. He escaped from house arrest last month and took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, setting off a behind-the-scenes diplomatic effort intended to prevent the situation from derailing the top-level meetings with Clinton and Geithner. On Wednesday, all seemed resolved when the 40-year-old Chen left the embassy to join his family at a Beijing hospital, with U.S. officials saying that he never requested asylum and that China gave assurances that he and his family would not face further persecution. That quickly unraveled at the hospital, where Chen said he wanted U.S. help to flee China with his family because he feared for their safety. The situation has tested the Obama administration's approach to relations with China, straining its commitment to uphold human rights even as it strives to maintain steady ties with Beijing. Last week, when Chen was still inside the embassy, U.S. officials refused to confirm his location and Obama declined to comment directly on the case when asked about it at a news conference. In comments Thursday at the high-level talks with China, Clinton made no mention of Chen while saying the topic of human rights was part of the discussion. A senior State Department official said Thursday the United States will do what it can to help Chen and his family leave China if they want to, but added that Washington doesn't have ""a magic wand"" to get him out of the country. At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney referred questions about the situation in China to the State Department. Carney repeated details previously released by State Department officials that Chen never asked for asylum while in the U.S. Embassy and was never pressured to leave. Romney, however, said news reports indicated that U.S. officials may have sped up Chen's decision to leave the embassy ""because they wanted to move on to a series of discussions that Mr. Geithner and our secretary of state are planning on having with China."" He also complained that the embassy failed to put in place ""the kind of verifiable measures that would assure the safety of Mr. Chen and his family."" ""We are a place of freedom here and around the world, and we should stand up and defend freedom wherever it is under attack,"" Romney said. Ben LaBolt, spokesman for the Obama campaign, said Romney's Thursday comments rang hollow. ""He has no coherent foreign policy vision, no concrete plans to enhance our security and strengthen our alliances, and he has taken conflicting positions on every major foreign policy issue facing our nation,"" LaBolt said in a statement. ""Rather than leveling these empty political attacks at the President, Mitt Romney should tell the American people exactly what he would do as commander in chief."" A statement by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said that ""the United States has an obligation to stand with the oppressed, not with the oppressor."" ""Having handed Chen Guangcheng back over to the Chinese government, the Obama administration is responsible for ensuring his safety,"" Boehner's statement said. ""While our economic relationship with China is important and vital to the future of people in both countries, the United States has an obligation to use its engagement with China to press for reforms in China's human rights practices, particularly with respect to the reprehensible 'one-child' policy."" Human rights groups and some members of Congress are pressuring the Obama administration to help Chen and his family get out. Noting the presence of Clinton in China for the talks, Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey called for the Obama administration to do ""everything it can to ensure that Chen Guangcheng, his family members and all those who have helped him are removed from harm's way."" ""They must seize this golden opportunity to help save Chen and his family and demonstrate to the world that the (United States) stands firm for fundamental human rights and the rule of law,"" said Smith, the chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. ""Trade talks are important, but human rights are not 'an irritant' -- we have a duty to protect and defend."" Later Thursday, Smith chaired an emergency hearing on the issue that included a telephone conversation with Chen from Beijing amplified by holding a cellular phone up to a hearing room microphone. Speaking to Chen, Smith called his case a test of the Chinese government's commitment to protect him and ""also a test of the United States as to whether or not human rights really do matter."" Carney, repeatedly asked about the issue by reporters at the White House daily briefing, said the president is ""not concerned about political back-and-forth on this issue."" ""He is focused on the need to advance U.S. interests in our relationship with China"" and to make ""an open and frank discussion on human rights"" part of that relationship, Carney said. Human rights advocacy groups raised doubts about whether Beijing would stick to the promises it reportedly made regarding Chen's ability to live free of persecution in China. Chinese officials did not comment directly on what deal had been reached with the United States over Chen. In comments reported by state media, they focused on what they described as ""interference"" by Washington in China's internal affairs. To Kenneth Lieberthal, director of the John L. Thornton China Center and a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, the balance of human rights issues such as the Chen case with other significant issues for both the United States and China marked a maturing of relations between the countries. ""The juxtaposition of a classic human rights issue with these other issues highlights the range of our relationship and our capacity now to do what U.S. policy has sought -- which is to deal with these issues separately so that problems in any one part of the relationship don't disrupt our ability to address very important issues in other parts of the relationship,"" Lieberthal said on the Brookings website. ""That's what a mature relationship is about."" A co-author of a book on Obama's foreign policy published in March, Lieberthal said the balanced approach by Washington ""does not mean, as some in the advocacy community have said, that this means that effectively we don't give much priority to human rights."" ""What it does mean is that we give priority to human rights, we give priority to nuclear proliferation, we give priority to cybersecurity, we give priority to jobs and economic growth in the United States and how China's economic polices affect that,"" said Lieberthal, a former University of Michigan professor who was a special adviser on national security affairs to President Bill Clinton. ""We have a series of priorities, each of which we pursue vigorously, and I think that's the right way to do it."" Carney seemed to agree Thursday, telling reporters: ""We are continuing to pursue our broad agenda with China on a whole range of issues.""

"(CNN) -- Ten-man Chelsea produced an astonishing comeback to recover from 2-0 down on the night and beat defending champions Barcelona 3-2 on aggregate in a scarcely believable Champions League semifinal at the Camp Nou on Tuesday. Chelsea began the second-leg tie with a slender 1-0 lead and looked doomed when captain John Terry was sent off for violent conduct in the 37th minute and Andres Iniesta put Barcelona 2-1 up overall shortly afterward. But Ramires put Chelsea ahead on away goals moments before halftime and Chelsea somehow held off wave after wave of Barcelona attack after the break before snatching a 2-2 draw. Lionel Messi hit the bar with a penalty early in the second half and later had another shot pushed onto the post by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech. Substitute Fernando Torres completed the most unlikely of wins when he scored on the break in injury time to guarantee Chelsea's place in the final of Europe's top club competition for the second time in the English side's history. Is Chelsea win sport's greatest upset? ""It is an incredible achievement by this group of players,"" said Chelsea coach Robeto di Matteo, who took over in early March on an interim basis when Andre Villas Boas was sacked. ""A lot of people have written us off but we showed the character these players have."" Chelsea will play either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the May 19 final at the latter's Allianz Arena. They will have to do without Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, Ramires and Raul Meireles, who will all be suspended, but that was at the back of the players' minds as they celebrated one of the club's greatest wins. ""It was not beautiful,"" Torres said, ""and we were playing the best team in the world, but Barcelona did not take their chances and, in the end, it worked for us."" Barcelona, meanwhile, now only have the Spanish Cup to play for after losing to Real Madrid at the weekend and all but conceding the La Liga title. ""It wasn't meant to be this year,"" coach Josep Guardiola said. ""The first thing that goes through my head is immense sorrow. ""We played exceptionally well for 180 minutes, we did everything we could to be in the final. We've never worked this hard to be in a final. We failed because we didn't score (more goals)."" Having come away from the first leg ahead due to Didier Drogba's goal, Chelsea traveled to the Camp Nou knowing Barcelona had won their last 15 home matches in the Champions League. Things started badly when defender Gary Cahill limped off after 12 minutes and got worse when midfielder Sergio Busquets put Barcelona ahead in the 35th minute from Isaac Cuenca's cutback. Two minutes later, former England captain Terry inexplicably raised his knee as he ran up behind Alexis Sanchez and was shown a straight red card -- leaving Chelsea without both their center halves. ""I want to apologize to the lads and the fans,"" Terry said later. ""I feel like I've let the lads down."" A minute after Terry departed, Iniesta looked to have set Barcelona on their way to the final when he finished off a trademark passing move with a precise, low shot into the far corner from Messi's through ball. Terry's absence meant midfielder Ramires was pushed into action as a right back but it was the Brazilian who unexpectedly gave Chelsea hope before halftime. Barcelona had their own defensive reorganization to carry out when Gerard Pique came off after 25 minutes with a head injury to be replaced by Dani Alves, and the hosts were wide open at the back as Ramires skipped on to Frank Lampard's pass and expertly lifted the ball over the stranded Victor Valdes. Barcelona began the second half in determined mood and quickly won a penalty when Drogba -- who was otherwise superb -- slid in rashly and brought down Cesc Fabregas. Messi stepped up to try to score his 64th goal of the season but smacked the bar with his spot kick. The three-time world player of the year is still yet to score against Chelsea. It still seemed only a matter of time before Barcelona got the crucial goal but as the minutes ticked down amid increasing desperation among the home fans, it began to look like fate was on Chelsea's side. Sanchez had the ball in the net but the offside flag was up against Alves before Messi was again denied when Cech got fingertips to his shot minutes before full time, leaving him without a goal against Chelsea in eight games. Torres, by contrast, has hardly found the net since moving to Chelsea but it was left to the misfiring Spaniard to run through and score his eighth goal in 11 games against Barcelona. In the English Premier League on Tuesday, Bolton came from a goal down to beat Aston Villa 2-1 to raise hopes of escaping relegation and leave their opponents just three points above the drop zone.","Chelsea sub Fernando Torres seals 3-2 aggregate win over Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Have you ever found yourself standing hands akimbo in front of your suitcase in your hotel room thinking ""I knew I'd forget that,"" or ""why did I bring five pairs of shoes and just one pair of trousers?"" I'm guilty on all counts. Ever since, I've developed a habit of packing three times, especially if I am flying long haul. I don't like being rushed or packing last minute, so I always start three days before I travel. The first time, I allow myself to throw everything in I'd ideally like to take in case of any change in weather or impromptu dinners or downtime (my tennis racket unfortunately never makes the cut). The second time, I pack with conviction and whittle it down, packing just for work -- how many interviews and locations I'll film and whether or not I need different outfits for those shoots. All zipped up, I test the weight. If I can easily pick the suitcase up, say an inch off the ground, it's about 19 kg. Then I leave it for a day, unpack everything and pack one last time folding everything, using every inch of the suitcase as it fills up. Chargers and adapters in shoes, that sort of thing! If I'm staying at a one or two-star hotel I'll pack little bottles of shampoo and conditioner that I've collected from a nicer hotel from previous trips! When it comes to hand luggage, I'm very particular. I pack my handbag in my suitcase and just travel with a waterproof shoulder bag in case it rains or in case I spill drinks everywhere. I pretty much travel with the same things on every trip. I stopped taking fruit with me ever since I forgot I had an apple in my bag when we arrived in New Zealand back in 2006. I was fined $60 because I had failed to declare it. It was the most expensive apple I've ever bought -- sorry, that Richard ever bought. He was my hero but also the one who made fun of me the most about it! Anyway, now my travel essentials are: . - Note pad and pen . - Cardigan and pashmina for any change in weather. - A second purse to hold foreign coins . - IPad -- great for browsing newspapers and twitter feeds, storing photos. - A book. I still haven't fallen in love with e-books. I'm currently reading What Makes Business Rocks by Bill Roedy. - My yellow headphones -- always more comfortable wearing your own than airline headsets and music is a great escape for little windows of downtime. - Digital camera -- I am an aviation enthusiast, planespotter, plane geek! When I can, I prefer to fly during the day so that I can take photos from the window seat of the aircraft wing, winglets or engines during sunsets complete with the Moon or with cities down below.

"(CNN) -- Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba has been pictured for the first time since collapsing on the pitch with a cardiac arrrest during his side's FA Cup quarterfinal match against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on March 17. Muamba is shown smiling and sitting up on his bed at the London Chest Hospital where he is recovering from his ordeal. The photograph was posted Friday on the Twitter account of his girlfriend Shauna. ""Fab wanted me to post this pic for you all and to also say thank you for such overwhelming support,"" read the message with the picture. The 23-year-old is wearing a T-shirt and hooded top, but is in a room full of medical equipment. Muamba collapsed during the first half of the game at Tottenham, being stretchered off while horrified players and fans watched on. It was also being shown on television. The match was abandoned, with Tottenham winning the replayed tie 3-1 earlier this week. It was later revealed Muamba's heart had stopped for 78 minutes while desperate, but in the end successful, attempts were made to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, English Premier League side Aston Villa said Friday that their captain, Stiliyan Petrov, has been diagnosed with acute leukaemia. The 32-year-old Bulgarian international midfielder had undergone medical tests after going down with a fever following Villa's 3-0 defeat to Arsenal last Saturday.

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney's first half goal gave Manchester United a 1-0 win over Fulham Monday to go back to the top of the English Premier League. The champions went into the evening clash at Old Trafford knowing a win would take them three points clear of local rivals Manchester City, who have led the standings for much of the season. But it proved a hard won victory against obdurate opponents, who offered a threat throughout.. Fulham had strong penalty claims turned away late in the game as substitute Danny Murphy went tumbling in the box under challenge from Michael Carrick. Referee Michael Oliver waved the appeals away and United were left to celebrate a vital win, their sixth in a row. They had started the game with flourish but Fulham stifled their early threat and looked set to go in at halftime level. But a defensive mistake undid Martin Jol's team as Ashley Young's cross initially eluded Rooney before John Arne Riise dithered and Jonny Evans sent back in the cross for the England striker to score his 11th in nine games. The excellent Antonio Valencia forced a fine save from Mark Schwartzer in the Fulham goal and the Australian also denied Ashley Young after the break with Brede Hangeland blocking a follow up from Ryan Giggs. With Rooney replaced by Paul Scholes, United looked to settle for just the single goal but were nearly undone as Carrick appeared to clip Murphy, with even his manager Alex Ferguson admitting his side had been lucky to avoid conceding a penalty. ""I think they had a claim, no doubt,"" he told Sky Sports. ""We had a claim for a penalty in the first half when there was a clear hand ball. ""Maybe the ref was thinking about that."" Manchester City's 1-1 draw at Stoke had seen them head champions United on goal difference but with eight games left in the season they now trail.

"(CNN) -- Libya's government on Tuesday appealed a request from the International Criminal Court to hand over Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, saying it should be given more time to make its own case. Gadhafi, son of deposed strongman Moammar Gadhafi, was facing an arrest warrant from the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity at the time of his capture, and the court is still seeking to prosecute him. Officials with the ICC, based at The Hague in the Netherlands, said Thursday that Libya must make arrangements to hand him over immediately. He has been held in the Libyan city of Zintan since his capture in November. But the Libyan government said in its appeal filing Tuesday that legally, the ICC was wrong to turn down its request for a postponement to surrender Gadhafi. Libyan authorities intend to file a challenge to the ICC case, which should be considered before it's decided when he must be handed over, the appeal document says. The Libyan government wants to prosecute Gadhafi itself, as it ""regards the trial of Saif al-Islam and Abdullah al-Senussi as a matter of the highest national importance, not only in bringing justice for the Libyan people but also in demonstrating that the new Libyan justice system is capable of conducting fair trials (that meet all applicable international standards) in complex cases,"" it says. Al-Senussi, who was Libya's chief of intelligence under the Gadhafi regime, is wanted by both the ICC and the Libyan government. He was arrested in Mauritania last month. The appeal document also seeks to answer ICC concerns about Saif al-Islam Gadhafi's well-being, saying the government ""has expended considerable resources in order to ensure the safe and secure temporary custody"" of Gadhafi in Zintan and is negotiating to bring him to the capital, where facilities would be better. ICC defense lawyers said last week that the son of Libya's deposed leader has been mistreated and ""physically attacked"" since his capture. Gadhafi is in a ""legal black hole,"" held for 139 days in ""total isolation"" except for visits from officials, his ICC-appointed defense said in a strongly worded statement. He also suffers dental pain because he hasn't had treatment, and Libyan authorities have given him nothing to remedy the pain, lawyers Xavier-Jean Keita and Melinda Taylor said. ""At no point have the Libyan authorities been legally justified in their failure to surrender him to the ICC,"" the lawyers said. ""The brutal death of Moammar Gadhafi deprived the Libyan people of their right to justice and their right to the truth. It would be a travesty for the prospects of a free and fair Libyan state if the same were to occur to his son,"" they said. Keita said Gadhafi had also been given misleading information about the severity of the allegations against him. ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said it is possible that the court will allow Libya to proceed with its case if the Libyans explain their plans. ""According to the rules, Libya has the primacy to prosecute Saif, so if they present this to the International Criminal Court judges, probably they will get an approval,"" Moreno-Ocampo said Thursday. ""That's the system. The system is the primacy for the national judges."" Amnesty International called on Libya to hand over Gadhafi at once in light of the ICC statement. ""An unfair trial before a Libyan court where the accused could face the death penalty is no way to guarantee justice and accountability,"" the rights group said. Amnesty said Libya did not have a functioning court system and the country was ""unable to conduct effective investigations,"" so ""the ICC will be crucial in delivering accountability in Libya."" Libya and the ICC have been going back and forth since his capture about where Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, will be tried. After visiting Gadhafi in custody last year, Human Rights Watch said that he should have a lawyer. But Interior Minister Fawzy Abdilal implied in February that he had not asked for one. ""He may have a lawyer if he asks for a lawyer,"" the interior minister told CNN. ""Should Saif demand a lawyer, then a lawyer would be provided."" Moammar Gadhafi died after his capture by opposition forces last October. CNN's Bharati Naik and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","International Criminal Court is wrong to ask for Saif al-Islam Gadhafi's surrender, Libya says .

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- To the family of Zina Hodge, the man who dashed into their burning home and pulled their loved one to safety through intense heat, falling embers and dense smoke could just be Superman. But Newark Mayor Cory Booker most definitely did not feel like the Man of Steel on Friday as he recovered from smoke inhalation and second-degree burns suffered during the rescue of his 47-year-old neighbor the previous night. ""I did not feel too heroic,"" Booker told reporters. ""It all happened very, very quickly and I just feel very blessed that she and I got out of the building alive."" Booker, 42, has fostered a reputation as a hands-on mayor of sorts, once spotted shoveling city streets during a 2010 blizzard and using his Twitter feed to coordinate snow plows and the delivery of supplies. His latest feat for his constituents went viral Friday as news of the rescue spread and social media users quickly dubbed him ""Super Mayor."" A new Tumblr blog named SuperCoryBooker was thrown together Friday with tongue-in-cheek memes about the mayor's knack for getting things done. ""Just another day, saving Newark,"" read one. For his part, Booker was quick to cast off the ""superhero"" title. ""I think that's way over the top,"" he said outside his home. ""There are people who do this every day,"" referring to police officers, firefighters and other first-responders. ""I'm a neighbor that did what most neighbors would do, which is to jump into action to help a friend,"" Booker said. The incident began around 9:30 p.m. Thursday as Booker was en route to his Newark residence. Two members of his security detail -- already waiting outside for the mayor -- noticed flames coming out of a second-story window of the neighbor's home and called fire dispatch before banging on the door to alert the home's occupants. The security officers, Detectives Alex Rodriguez and Santos Duran, managed to rescue three people by the time Booker arrived. ""As the last one was coming out, I was going up the stairs and she's screaming that her daughter is still in the building,"" Booker recalled. Flanked by the two detectives, Booker rushed toward the building, he said. ""Something exploded and sent a lot of flames over the steps, and my detail just grabbed me and started trying to drag me out of there,"" he said. Booker exchanged heated words with Rodriguez, who was pulling him by the belt to get him to safety. ""Look, this woman is going to die if we don't continue,"" Booker recalled saying. The detective relented and let him continue on. Once inside, Booker had what he described as his ""proverbial come-to-Jesus moment"" as he felt the intensity of the heat and had trouble finding Hodge. ""The reality is I didn't feel any courage. I felt fear,"" he said. ""I've never been so almost convinced that this was it. It was time to hope that I was going up and not down."" But just as he was ""praying, thinking, hoping,"" Hodge called out and Booker found her in a back room. Hoisting her, Booker ran through the flames, embers falling from the ceiling, and made his way outside before collapsing onto the sidewalk. ""Her mother gave me a hug I'll never forget for getting her out,"" he said. ""At that point, I felt this sense of gratitude. To go moments from thinking you're dead to kissing the Newark pavement ... I felt like I was delivered from the fires of hell."" Thursday's rescue marked Booker's latest foray into the media spotlight. The mayor has enjoyed a steady rise in national prominence as an outspoken advocate for urban issues since taking office in 2006. His efforts to turn around a city long struggling with high crime, chronic poverty and a restrictive budget are chronicled on the Sundance Channel's series ""Brick City."" His reputation also contrasts with that of several previous Newark mayors, a few of whom were convicted on corruption-related charges. Hodge is being treated at Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey, where she is in serious condition, officials said. Newark Fire Director Fateen Ziyad said the three other residents who were removed from the home ""are doing well."" ""It's like one in a million, the mayor to get your family out,"" said Robert Cooper, 20, who is Hodge's nephew. Still, Booker said his two detectives were ""the real heroes"" and sought to give Rodriguez and Duran most of the credit. As for his own super powers, Booker said the whole incident ""unfolded in a way that I think that angels helped to make it so."" CNN's Marina Landis and Mark Norman contributed to this report.","Cory Booker is quickly dubbed ""Super Mayor"" as word of his heroic rescue spreads .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden's three widows and two daughters could be deported from Pakistan on Wednesday after their period of house detention expired overnight. A Pakistani judge ordered earlier this month that the five women be deported back to their countries of citizenship after serving their sentence for living illegally in Pakistan. The 45-day detention period ended Tuesday night, said Aamir Khalil, the widows' lawyer. But he said he had no information on when they would be deported. The widows -- identified by U.S. and Pakistani officials as Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar -- have been in Pakistani custody since U.S. Navy SEALs raided bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad and killed the al Qaeda leader in May 2011. The daughters are aged 17 and 21, Khalil said. All five defendants confessed to impersonation, illegal entry into Pakistan and staying illegally in Pakistan and chose not to appeal the judge's sentence. Yemen has officially announced that it will allow Fateh, bin Laden's youngest widow, to return to her homeland. Her brother Zakaria Abdul Fateh said the Yemeni Embassy in Islamabad was processing her paperwork and that she planned to go back to Sanaa next month. The position of the authorities in Saudi Arabia, where the other two widows are from, is unclear. Saudi Arabia had initially been resistant to their return. Bin Laden spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children with Fateh -- at least one of whom was born in a government hospital, she told Pakistani investigators. A deposition taken from Fateh gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him. He and his family moved from city to city with the help of Pakistanis who arranged ""everything"" for them, Fateh said, according to the deposition. She told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in Pakistan. CNN's Shaan Khan and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","The detention of the widows and daughters of Osama bin Laden has ended .

"(Mashable) -- The patent war between Facebook and Yahoo may be only just starting. A new report says Facebook has acquired 750 patents from computer-systems giant IBM. The news comes shortly after Yahoo sued Facebook for patent infringement over 10 of its software patents. A ""person with knowledge of the transaction"" tipped the news to Bloomberg Businessweek, though the deal hasn't been made public yet. Compared to other tech companies, Facebook's arsenal of patents is rather meager: The company has just 56 patents compared with the thousands stockpiled by the likes of Microsoft and Apple. However, the report says, Facebook has applied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for at least 500 more. Apparently it didn't want to wait for those to be approved and chose to take a shortcut in stocking up its patent portfolio. The lawsuit from Yahoo, which has recently had a wholesale change in management and is expected to announce layoffs, likely provided the motivation. See also: Tech industry scorns Yahoo over Facebook patent suit . Many tech companies are now using patents strategically to both generate revenue and discourage competition. For example, Google licenses many patents from Microsoft in the making of the Android platform, which provides a steady cash flow for Microsoft. In other cases, such as the many patent lawsuits between Apple and Samsung, patents are used to shut competitors out of entire regions (though that's rarely the outcome). IBM has been friendly in selling patents to younger tech companies in the past. In January, Google bought 217 patents from the IBM, including one for a ""semantic social network.""

"(CNN) -- Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, serving a seven-year sentence after last year's conviction on a charge of abuse of authority, has been on a hunger strike for four days because she was beaten unconscious in prison last week, she said Tuesday. But the prosecutor said Tuesday that his office immediately investigated Tymoshenko's claim and didn't find proof to substantiate her allegations. A medical expert was sent, but Tymoshenko refused an examination, said Gennady Tyurin, general prosecutor of Kharkiv region. He said he has declined to open a criminal case. ""The investigation is over,"" Tyurin said. Last October, a Ukrainian court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to the seven-year prison term. Prior to the alleged beating, Tymoshenko was discussing with officials a transfer Monday to a hospital for health reasons, she said. But on Friday evening, her cell mate left the cell, and then ""three sturdy men"" entered, threw a bed sheet over her, dragged her off the bed and applied ""brutal force,"" she said in a statement. ""In pain and despair, I started to defend myself as I could and got a strong blow in my stomach through the bed sheet,"" she said in a statement. Tymoshenko was dragged ""into the street,"" she said. ""I thought these were the last minutes of my life. In unbearable pain and fear I started to cry and call out for help, but no help came."" She fell unconscious, and when she came to, she was in a hospital ward, she said. Tymoshenko went on her hunger strike the day after the beating, Saturday, she said. She stopped taking food ""to draw attention of the democratic world to things happening in the center of Europe, in the country named Ukraine,"" she said. Tymoshenko charged that ""the president of Ukraine is steadily and pedantically building a concentration camp of violence and lack of rights."" She is asking for a ""public international investigation"" into the administration of President Viktor Yanukovych and added, ""we must do everything possible to remove the Yanukovych regime."" In April 2011, the Ukraine's Prosecutor General's office opened a criminal case charging Tymoshenko with signing overpriced gas deals with Russian energy provider Gazprom that inflicted damages to the country amounting to more than 1.5 billion hryvnas (almost $190 million at the current exchange rate) and that Tymoshenko had allegedly no right to sign. The court ruled Tymoshenko must repay the money, and she is banned from holding public office for three years. Tymoshenko narrowly lost to Yanukovych in a presidential election in February 2010, and she became his fiercest opponent. She has repeatedly brushed off all charges against her as political, calling the trial a ""farce"" and naming the judge a ""stooge of Yanukovych's administration,"" appointed to ""fabricate"" the case. Amnesty International has slammed the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005 and December 2007 to March 2010. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Ukraine's former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, hasn't taken food since Friday night .

"(Mashable) -- The $1 billion photo-sharing app Instagram -- once named ""app of the year"" by Apple -- has now ""jumped the shark,"" according to Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller. And not only is Schiller trashing the service (in a brief message to Apple enthusiast Clayton Braasch), he has also deleted his Instagram account (@schiller) entirely (much like some thousands of other users.) What got Schiller so upset? Not the billion-dollar acquisition by Facebook, apparently. ""It 'jumped the shark' when it went to Android,"" was all the Apple executive wrote to Braasch Thursday. Instagram launched its Android version earlier this month. In the first five days, the Android app saw five million users sign up. That's not huge compared to the 30 million iPhone users, but the rate of growth was stunning -- and strongly contributed to Mark Zuckerberg's decision to offer Kevin Systrom $1 billion for the app. What exactly Schiller meant is unclear. How can five million new users on a slightly different platform make an app ""jump the shark""? Many iPhone Instagram users have seen their follower counts swell, but it's hard to see what's wrong with that. You wouldn't be hard pressed to see further evidence that the ""nuclear war"" Steve Jobs vowed to wage against Android is being continued by his successors at Apple. If a favored iOS app launching on Android is enough to earn a rebuke from a top Apple executive, that may serve as a warning to other app makers who are currently on iOS alone. Remember, Apple is a company where practically every executive comment is a calculated one. (Naturally, we've reached out to Apple for comment and will let you know if we hear back.) But it's got to be galling for Instagram. Just four months ago, Schiller was congratulating them on his Twitter feed, where he also plugged his own Instagram account: . @pschiller: Congrats to @foofighters @instagram and all the iTunes Rewind 2011 winners! (btw: @schiller on Instagram ;->) Follow that account link now, and all you'll see is an Instagram error page. You could well argue that with Zuckerberg's backing and $1 billion in the bank, Systrom et al have no more need for Apple's patronage. But the majority of Instagram's users are still on the iPhone, and the iPhone's handlers apparently just turned hostile. Update: Braasch reached out to Schiller for clarification, and got the following via email: . Instagram is a great app and community. That hasn't changed. But one of the things I really liked about Instagram was that it was a small community of early adopters sharing their photographs. Now that it has grow [sic] much larger the signal to noise ratio is different. That isn't necessarily good or bad, it's just not what I originally had fun with. What do you make of Schiller's comments? Can Instagram patch things up? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

"Berlin (CNN) -- A chemical accident involving chlorine gas injured nearly 40 people Tuesday at a plant for security technology in Bruhl. Of the 39 victims, seven were seriously injured, according to Markus Brachschoss, a spokesman for the local fire department. Around 300 people were inside the plant at the time of the accident. The incident occurred when two chemicals -- sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid -- came into contact, emitting chlorine gas. Air tests were conducted inside the building where the accident occurred and in surrounding buildings, Brachschoss said. The fire department determined no threat was posed to the surrounding community.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners descended on a suburban church in northern Italy on Thursday for the funeral of footballer Piermario Morosini, who died after collapsing on the pitch last week. Mourners lined the streets of Bergamo to see the 25-year-old Livorno player finally laid to rest in his hometown at the Church of San Gregorio. The midfielder's coffin was draped in his Livorno shirt as well as an Atalanta top bearing his name and the No. 8. Priest Luciano Manenti looked on as the coffin, adorned with wreaths and flowers, was carried from the church into a hearse. Morosini, who was on loan from Udinese, started out in Atalanta's youth team. Among the mourners were his longtime girlfriend Anna Vavassori, Italian soccer federation president Giancarlo Abete and national team coach Cesare Prandelli. ""Soccer must pose itself questions following this tragedy,"" Prandelli said after the funeral, according to Italian news agency Ansa. ""Sporting medicine and prevention are state of the art in Italy, but it's possible to improve."" Morosini's life had been blighted by tragedy with the loss of both his parents before his 18th birthday. His disabled brother later committed suicide, leaving him alone with his handicapped elder sister Maria Carla. The funeral followed a packed memorial ceremony at Livorno's Armando Picchi Stadium the previous day. Thousands of mourners filled the stands to pay tribute as a hearse carrying Morosini's coffin did a lap of the ground. Livorno's president Aldo Spinelli struggled to hold back tears as he saluted the player. Morosini died last Saturday after collapsing on the pitch during his side's Serie B game at Pescara. Initially it was thought Morosini had suffered a cardiac arrest but a post mortem on Monday proved inconclusive. The entire Italian football program that weekend was canceled and a minute's silence was observed at major league games around the world in his honor. Morosini's death has raised questions about the procedures in place at Italian stadiums to deal with an emergency of the type that cost him his life. Prosecutors are investigating whether a badly parked police car delayed the arrival of paramedics on the scene. Udinese has set up a fund for Maria Carla, who relied on her brother for financial support.","Thousands of mourners line streets of Morosini's hometown Bergamo for funeral .

"(CNN) -- Yves Rossy calls it ""the dream"" -- the ancient human yearning to fly like a bird. Thanks to four tiny jet engines and wings with a span of two meters, the Swiss pilot has lived the dream. As ""Jetman,"" he's flown over the Grand Canyon, crossed over the English Channel, and, most recently, soared above the Alps in formation with two jet airplanes. ""I don't have feathers. But I feel like a bird sometimes,"" he said, in an onstage interview with Bruno Giussani at the TED Global conference in July in Edinburgh, UK. ""It's really an unreal feeling, because normally you have a big thing, a plane, around you. And when I strap just these little harnesses, this little wing, I really have the feeling of being a bird."" The suit, including the four engines, weighs 55 kilograms (121 pounds) and enables Rossy to reach speeds of 190 mph. He has no steering control except the movements of his own body. He can ascend by arching his back or dive by hunching his shoulders; he turns by moving his head. TED.com: A plane you can drive . Rossy, who has piloted commercial jets, got the idea about 20 years ago when he tried skydiving. ""When you go out of an airplane you are almost naked ... you have the feeling that you are flying. And that's the nearest thing to the dream. You have no machine around you. You are just in the element."" The problem? ""It's very short and only in one direction."" Developing the Jetman wings enabled Rossy to travel in other directions than simply down -- and to stay in the air longer. He's been aloft for as long as 13 minutes. Not every adventure has succeeded. He lost control when trying to cross the Strait of Gibraltar and, deploying a parachute, plunged into the sea. TED.com: Bertrand Piccard's solar-powered adventure .

"(CNN) -- Briton Lewis Hamilton set the pace in Friday practice at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. After lapping the Gilles Villeneuve circuit in one minute 15.564 seconds in the morning to beat Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, Hamiton went even quicker in the afternoon to edge out Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Brazilian Felipe Massa, who finished sixth at the Monaco Grand Prix after a sluggish start to the season, continued to show signs of improvement after setting the third fastest time, with Vettel in fourth and Force India's Paul di Resta in fifth, just ahead of Mercedes' Michael Schumacher. Hamilton's McLaren teammate Jenson Button, ended the day in the ninth after both his practice sessions were disrupted by oil leaks. ""I'm very happy with my start to the weekend,"" Hamilton told the Formula One website. ""I'm happy that the rain held off for both sessions and happy that we got through a lot of good set-up changes. ""This is a great track to drive - it's a place that requires 100% commitment and where the driver can really make a difference. It magnifies the differences between drivers."" Button added: ""I'm not too worried - the car has been working well and Lewis has been quick all day, so there's a lot of good information for us to look at. ""I enjoy driving around this place, so we'll be hoping for a bit more luck."" Vettel concurred with both Hamilton and Button on how enjoyable it was to race at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit. ""There are a lot of stop and starts, braking, chicanes and quick changes in direction but it's good fun - it's part of this track, there are bumps, so it's wild and rough, but it's fun.""

"(CNN) -- The 49 decapitated bodies authorities found on a roadside in northern Mexico over the weekend were likely the result of a fierce feud between rival drug cartels, a top Mexican official said Monday. ""In recent weeks, we have had a series of inhuman and despicable acts in different parts of the country that mark an irrational fight fundamentally between two existing criminal groups and their criminal allies,"" Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire said. There are ""clear indications,"" he said, that a recent surge in violent acts -- including the mutilated remains found Sunday in Nuevo Leon state -- stem from a ""direct conflict"" between the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartels over territory and power. Poire stressed that the Mexican government would not retreat from its efforts to crack down on organized crime, which is facing increasing criticism as Mexico's presidential campaign season heats up. ""I know very well that these acts worry society, but the solution is not to let our guard down,"" Poire said. President Felipe Calderon, seen as the chief champion of Mexico's crime-fighting strategy, is not running for re-election. But opposition candidates have criticized his administration's approach. More than 47,000 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when Calderon announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat cartels. On Sunday, it appeared that authorities would be adding at least 49 more people to that tally, after decapitated and dismembered bodies were found along a highway in the municipality of Cadereyta Jimenez, near the industrial city of Monterrey and about 80 miles southwest of the U.S. border. A message written on a wall nearby appeared to refer to the Zetas drug cartel. The Zetas started with deserters from the Mexican army and quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as the armed branch of Mexico's Gulf cartel. The partnership ended in 2010. Now, analysts say the Gulf cartel is allied with the Sinaloa cartel, one of the nation's most powerful drug-trafficking groups. Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera is widely known as Mexico's most wanted fugitive. Forbes magazine has placed him on its list of the world's most powerful people, reporting his net worth is $1 billion as of March. Authorities are still working to identify the victims whose bodies were found Sunday, Poire said. State officials said Sunday they had not ruled out the possibility that the victims could be Central American immigrants or residents of another state, telling reporters Sunday that there had not been many local missing persons reports in recent days. But the area has become a battleground for a brutal conflict between the Zetas and the Gulf cartel, and reports of forced disappearances have become increasingly common in recent years. So have claims that local police, with lower salaries that authorities say make them easier to corrupt than federal troops, have been infiltrated and influenced by cartels. Last week, a retired military general arrived to take over Cadereyta Jimenez's depleted police force. At least five municipal employees were slain there last month, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Federal forces have stepped up security in Nuevo Leon and the neighboring state of Tamaulipas since November 2010. The states are among Mexico's most violent, according to government statistics. In Monterrey, Nuevo Leon's capital, nearly 400 deaths in 2011 were connected to organized crime -- more than three times the number of people slain in drug-related violence there in 2010. Among the most high-profile violence in the region was an attack on a casino in Monterrey last August that left 52 people dead. Authorities have said members of the Zetas cartel were behind that attack. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, journalist Victor Badillo and CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","Interior minister: Violence is related to fighting between the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel .

"(CNN) -- With world No. 1 Novak Djokovic struggling at the ATP World Tour Finals, a tired Rafael Nadal exiting early, and third-ranked Andy Murray limping out of contention, the scene is set for renewed protests by tennis stars about their testing tournament schedule. But Roger Federer, perhaps the greatest of them all, has flatly rejected the notion that players should go on strike. ""It was brought up a few months ago, the whole boycott thing. It's nonsense,"" the 16-time grand slam champion told reporters after clinching his third successive Group B win at the season-ending event on Thursday. ""It's not going to happen anytime soon. Things are good right now, so I don't see a reason why we should just boycott. There's absolutely no reason for it."" Can Federer make finals history? Murray's call for a players' meeting before last month's Shanghai Masters did not eventuate in any action, and the Scot himself later stated that he did not think a strike was necessary -- but that the issue of fixture scheduling needed to be addressed. Federer took a long break after the U.S. Open in September, while Nadal also had a rest with next month's Davis Cup final between Spain and Argentina in mind. Tsonga sends Nadal tumbling out of finals . Djokovic, meanwhile, had to take time out due to the back and shoulder injuries which have plagued the end of his sensational season.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Just as Mitt Romney secured the Republican nomination, President Obama launched his presidential campaign with a weeklong celebration of his foreign policy accomplishments. He and others in his administration blanketed the airwaves to discuss the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death, and the president made a surprise trip to Afghanistan to boast that he had fulfilled his promises. The president's campaign team rolled out a controversial ad that praised Obama for having made the decision to raid bin Laden's compound and went so far as to raise questions about whether Romney would have done the same. ""Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?"" reads the screen, followed by quotations and news stories about Romney criticizing the hunt for bin Laden. Only two election cycles after the GOP hammered away at Democrats for being weak on defense and incapable of handling the challenges of the post-9/11 era, Democrats in the White House are feeling confident enough to present their candidate as the person who has the more muscular foreign policy and the person who has made America safe. There are many reasons to feel this way. As Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne noted, ""The polls could hardly be clearer,"" with 53% of Americans polled reporting they feel more trust in Obama than Romney in dealing with international relations. But the temptations to pound on this theme should not obscure the serious challenges the president faces in taking this path. Though Romney remains vulnerable on national security given his minimal foreign policy record and the fact that Republicans are still saddled by some of the most controversial parts of George W. Bush's foreign policy record, namely Iraq, Democrats face significant risks if this becomes a central strategy. The first risk is that historically foreign policy is incredibly fickle. New crises can transform the politics of an issue within months, if not days, as the Arab Spring revealed. Many presidents have seen their national security advantage disappear quickly. In 1952, President Harry Truman and the Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson watched Republicans turn the stalemate in Korea, which followed the fall of China to communism in 1949, into a theme that undercut the political benefits from FDR's historic victory against fascism in 1945. John F. Kennedy saw how his resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 helped Democrats hold on to their seats in the midterm elections, at a time when the GOP had been planning to highlight the president's failed policies in Cuba. In 2003, President George W. Bush experienced this turnaround as well. After quick triumphs in Afghanistan and Iraq, his speech in front of a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner turned into a sign of weakness when the postwar battles proved difficult. Although Bush won re-election in 2004, the turn of events would severely undercut his popular standing throughout his second term. Last week provided more examples: A few hours after President Obama's visit to Afghanistan, bombs went off in Kabul. The diplomatic incident with the Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng turned from a deftly handled situation into an embarrassing, and apparently botched, process. And this weekend's elections in Greece and France have created great uncertainty about their austerity plans and, as a result, will likely result in turbulence in international stock markets. Other presidents have learned about the second challenge of playing the national security card, namely that in economically bad times, boasting about foreign policy can make a president look as if he is avoiding the real issues. Nowhere was this clearer than with George H.W. Bush, who in 1991, after the decisive defeat of Saddam Hussein in Operation Desert Storm, seemed invincible. ""The number of people who don't like George Bush,"" Newt Gingrich joked, ""is almost down to the number of people running for the Democratic nomination."" But as the recession worsened, Bush's desire to play up his foreign policy accomplishments made him look evasive and as if he didn't care much about domestic policy. Bill Clinton capitalized on this vulnerability with his campaign about economic policy. Bush went down to defeat. The third vulnerability is the fact that foreign policy has been notoriously messy in the post-Cold War world. The kind of clarity that foreign policy had during the Cold War, with a clear enemy and clear areas of competition, has been gone since the 1980s. That has been replaced by a world of foreign policy defined by amorphous terrorist networks, rogue states whose loyalties are constantly shifting and ethnic warfare in which it is difficult to distinguish the good from the bad. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore learned how difficult it was to develop political capital in this world of foreign policy. Despite a significant victory in Kosovo, where American air power helped bring down Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic, foreign policy success did little for Al Gore when he ran against Bush in 2000. The final danger is that President Obama could turn off some of the loyal supporters who he will need to energize to come out to vote, to organize and give money to his campaign, if the polls showing a close contest are to be believed. If Obama sounds too much like a hawk and engages in the kind of predictable national security scare tactics that other politicians, including his predecessor, used, he will further erode the image he held in 2008 of being a candidate who sought to raise public policy debates to a higher level. All these are reasons for the White House to think carefully about whether the campaign theme rolled out in the past week should be central in the coming months. While the temptations are immense for a commander in chief who has enjoyed success to use that record as a battering ram against his opponents, the politics of national security are trickier than they seem. Very often, those who are lured into making war and peace the message of their campaign find that the decision comes back to haunt them in November. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Focusing a presidential campaign on foreign policy is a risky gambit .
New crises can transform the politics of an issue within months, if not days, says Zelizer .
Fifty-three percent of Americans say they trust Obama more than Romney with foreign relations .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Hundreds of demonstrators extended their sit-in outside Egypt's defense ministry to a sixth day Thursday, as organizers called for mass protests following violence that killed at least 11 people. The coalition of political and civil groups -- known as the Board of Trustees of the Revolution -- condemned the clashes in Cairo's Abaseya area Wednesday and demanded the resignation of the government. The protests come against a backdrop of frustration over the pace of reform since Hosni Mubarak was ousted as president last year and amid concern that Egypt's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. Many of the protesters taking part in the sit-in are voicing their anger over the disqualification of Islamist candidate Hazem Abu Ismael from the May 23 presidential election. They also want to disband the presidential election commission. Abu Ismael was disqualified because of evidence that his late mother had U.S. citizenship, an assertion he has denied, prompting his followers to protest the decision by the election commission. The election commission has disqualified some 10 of the 23 presidential contenders, its chief has said. Meanwhile, three of Egypt's presidential candidates were referred to the general prosecutor for alleged violations of election campaign law Thursday. The presidential election commission said it had referred leading independent candidate Abdel Monein Aboul Fettouh, Mohamed Mursi, of the Islamist Freedom and Justice Party, and Amr Moussa to the prosecutor for breaking the law by holding meetings on college campuses. ""These infringements by the presidential candidates will be taken very seriously and they will be questioned as soon as possible. They could be fined,"" Adel Saeed, the official spokesman for the general prosecutor, told CNN. Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said on its Facebook page Thursday that the clashes in Abaseya were aimed at delaying the presidential elections and stalling the formation of a constituent assembly. The Supreme Council also said certain ""unnamed"" groups have used verses from the Quran calling for jihad, or holy war, to try to draw the military into an armed conflict. The military had tried to convince the protesters to move from their position near the Ministry of Defense to Tahrir Square, the heart of Egypt's protest movement, but they refused, the Facebook statement said. ""Investigations into the clashes of Abseya Square have begun and some people have been arrested,"" Saeed said. Two of the presidential candidates referred to the general prosecutor for investigation, Mursi and Fettouh, had announced Wednesday that they were temporarily suspending campaign activities because of the violence. Amr Moussa said in a televised statement that he had canceled some of his campaign events out of respect for those killed. Mursi said Wednesday he would suspend his campaign for two days to ""mourn the souls of the martyrs"" in the clashes, and blamed the military government for what he called a ""massacre."" Fettouh said on his Twitter account that lawmakers must push the interior minister to investigate. A ""revolutionary march"" toward the Ministry of Defense has been called for Friday by the April 6 Movement, which wants accountability from the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces over the deaths of protesters in the Abaseya clashes. Western powers have been watching developments in Egypt closely. Alistair Burt, UK Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, said Thursday he was deeply concerned by the recent bloodshed and called on all sides to show restraint. ""The right to peaceful freedom of expression and assembly is integral to Egypt's transition to democracy, and it is crucial at this stage of the presidential election process that it is not threatened by the return of such violence,"" he said in a statement. ""Such unrest reinforces the need to make progress on the transition to civilian rule, through a transparent and inclusive process which allows all voices to be heard, to the timetable already agreed by the Egyptian authorities."" ""We're very concerned about the outbreak of violence,"" said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice. The United States considers it ""important for elections to go forward as planned,"" she added. Assailants targeted the protesters in Cairo early Wednesday, medical sources said. At least 150 people were injured, Dr. Ahmed Thabet, a physician working in a field hospital near where the clashes took place, said Thursday. It was unclear who the attackers were, but they were not wearing uniforms, witnesses said. The mood in the city's Abaseya district appeared calm but tense, state media reported Thursday. Some shops closed their doors and some residents left their homes, fearing more clashes, according to Egypt's MENA news agency. Protesters hurled rocks at the assailants, who responded with a steady barrage of rocks and Molotov cocktails. ""Down with military rule!"" the protesters chanted. Alaa Younis, who took part in the sit-in with some friends, said ""dozens of military men dressed in plain clothes started pelting"" them ""with stones, cement blocks, and fired tear gas from rifles, so they were obviously security officers under cover."" The military dispatched a unit to attempt to restore calm. A day before the clashes, state TV broadcast videos showing protesters chanting against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak was forced from power last year. The Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, issued a statement Thursday blaming the Supreme Council for the death and injuries in the Abaseya clashes, saying it wanted to delay the transition of power. A government official earlier denied reports that the military was involved in Wednesday's violence. ""There were no riot police or military that tried to evict the sit-in by force,"" said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. ""We are not sure of the identities of the thugs that attacked the peaceful protesters. The military only protects the vicinity of the ministry and blocked some roads leading to it."" The epicenter of the violence was around a mosque in Cairo, but clashes continued in several streets. Residents formed neighborhood watches to protect their streets as gunfire crackled for hours, according to witnesses. The military blocked some highways leading to the ministry and did not interfere in the fighting between protesters and the unidentified attackers. Clashes have erupted in Egypt since an uprising led to the toppling of Mubarak in February of last year, with protesters demanding the military leaders who took over hand over power to a civilian administration.

"(CNN) -- A previously unknown piano work by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was performed Friday at the maestro's home in Salzburg, the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation said. The piece, recently unearthed in Austria, was played by noted pianist Florian Birsak. It was discovered in an attic of a private home in Tyrol, the foundation said, inside a handwritten book with more than 160 pages. Works by Mozart's father were found within the same book. The piece, 84 measures in length, is marked ""Allegro molto"" -- meaning it is meant to be played ""very quick."" It is thought to date from around 1767, which would mean Mozart wrote the work when he was about 11 years old. Most convincingly, perhaps, the piece contains the words ""Del Signore Giovane Wolfgango Mozart,"" or ""by the junior Mr. Wolfgang Mozart."" Mozart's father was known to use the name, ""Wolfgango,"" to identify his son's work. ""Throughout the Allegro molto, thematic formation, compositional setting and harmony have a number of components that are found repeated in other Mozart piano works,"" the foundation said in a statement. ""According to current scholarly knowledge, it must therefore be regarded as an authentic sonata movement by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."" Mozart, one of the world's best-known classical composers, was born in Salzburg in 1756. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","The work was found in an attic of a private home in Tyrol .

"(CNN) -- After the news of a U.S. soldier charged with murdering Afghan civilians, mostly women and children, the story of Spc. Dennis Weichel of the Rhode Island National Guard bears telling. The official Pentagon news release says he died ""from injuries suffered in a noncombat related incident."" But there is much more to the story. Weichel, 29, of Providence, died saving the life of a little girl. According to the Rhode Island National Guard and the U.S. Army, Weichel was in a convoy a week ago with his unit in Laghman Province, in northeast Afghanistan. Some children were in the road in front of the convoy, and Weichel and other troops got out to move them out of the way. Most of the children moved, but one little girl went back to pick up some brass shell casings in the road. Afghan civilians often recycle the casings, and the girl appeared to aim to do that. But a Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicle was moving toward her, according to Lt. Col. Denis Riel of the Rhode Island National Guard. MRAPs, as they are known, usually weigh more than 16 tons. Weichel saw massive truck bearing down on the girl and grabbed her out of the way. But in the process, the armored truck ran him over, Riel said. The little girl is fine. Weichel died a short time later of his injuries. ""He was a big kid at heart. He always had a smile on his face, and he made everyone laugh,"" 1st Sgt. Nicky Peppe, who served with Weichel in Iraq, is quoted as saying in an Army story. ""But as much as Weichel was funny, he was also a professional. When it was time to go outside the wire for a combat patrol, he was all business."" Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee has ordered flags in the state lowered to half-staff until Weichel, who was posthumously promoted to sergeant, is laid to rest Monday. Weichel is survived by his parents, his fiancee and three children. His family will receive Weichel's Bronze Star and other awards for his sacrifice.","Spc.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- UK police found 15 suspected illegal immigrants covered in cocoa powder in the back of a truck that was apparently headed to a Mars chocolate factory, police and border officials said Thursday. Police say they found the suspected illegal immigrants in the town of Slough, shown here in a file picture. The men, aged between around 20 and 40, were found Wednesday morning in Slough, west of London, Thames Valley Police said. ""They were all physically fine, although the ambulance services had to check them,"" said a police spokesman who asked not to be named, in line with policy. The men were covered in cocoa powder, said a spokesman for the UK Border Agency. Authorities suspect the truck was going to the Mars factory in Slough, he said. Another truck carried three more suspected illegal immigrants, said the spokesman, who also asked not to be named. All 18 men were handed over to the border agency, he said. The trucks were driven by two Dutch drivers, who have since been arrested, the spokesman said. The Mars factory in Slough produces chocolate snacks including Bounty, M&Ms, Mars, Milky Way, Snickers and Twix, according to the company.","UK police: Suspected illegal immigrants believed heading for a chocolate factory .

"(CNN) -- A resolute defensive display by AC Milan denied Barcelona a crucial away goal as the first leg of the European Champions League quarterfinal ended goalless at the San Siro on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola's defending champions dominated possession in both halves but couldn't find a way through Milan's defenses which were pushed to the limits at times. The Spanish visitors were denied what looked like a clear penalty in the first half when Alexis Sanchez was brought down by goalkeeper Christian Abbiati, but the referee remained unmoved. Lionel Messi, scorer of 55 goals in all competitions this season, did find the net in the 17th minute but was adjudged offside by the referee's assistant. Chances came and went for Barca, with perhaps the best of the second half falling to Sanchez. But his efforts to poke the ball home after Messi's shot was parried were in vain as left back Luca Antonini slid in to produce a heroic goal-saving tackle. The Italian league leaders also had their moments in front of goal but squandered chances to take the lead, with Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic both failing to find the net. ""I take it as a compliment that we have got this result, the team had a good game and I think it is a good result,"" veteran Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf said, AFP reported. ""A goal could be enough in the Nou Camp and we will have more of our players available. If we manage to play well we have chances to progress."" The two sides reconvene at the Nou Camp next Tuesday, with the winners playing either Chelsea or Benfica in the semifinal. Meanwhile at the Stade Velodrome, 2010 finalists Bayern Munich took a giant step towards the semis with a 2-0 win over Marseille. Goals in either half from striker Mario Gomez and Dutch winger Arjen Robben sealed a satisfying result for the Bundesliga's second-placed team, whose Allianz Arena stadium will host the May 19 final. Gomez opened the scoring in the 44th minute after his weak shot found its way under the body of goalkeeper Elinton Andrade. It was the Germany striker's 11th goal of the competition this season, putting him one short of Messi's leading tally. Dutch winger Robben scored the visitors' second away goal firing home from six yards in the 70th minute. ""We realized our objective by winning here without conceding any goals. Marseille play emotional football, so it was very important for us to get this result tonight,"" said Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes. A semifinal tie against, in all probability, Real Madrid awaits the winners of this quarterfinal tie, which also concludes next Tuesday.","Barcelona held to goalless draw by AC Milan in first leg of Champions League quarterfinal .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Gunmen loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh attacked the country's main airport with mortars Saturday, forcing authorities to cancel flights, witnesses and officials said. Two officials at Sanaa International Airport told CNN that the former commander of Yemen's air force had warned he would bring down any civil aircraft departing or arriving the airport unless his demands are met. The commander, Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar, is one of several relatives of the former president who were replaced in a major military shakeup. Al-Ahmar refused to give up his post. Ali Saleh was forced to step down from power in February. Al-Ahmar, the half-brother of the former president, was given a new position as assistant to the minister of defense in Friday's presidential decree, but has refused to leave his air force post. The officials said he threatened to cause chaos if three opposition military officials are not removed from their military posts along with him. The airport was not allowing flights to arrive or depart the country due to the tension, according to security officials at the airport who wished to remain anonymous. Friday's shakeup was announced in a statement by a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington and attributed to current President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. ""President Hadi promised major change in the military, and tonight that promise was delivered,"" said Mohammed Albasha, the embassy spokesman. ""This is the biggest military shakeup in modern Yemen history."" Another of the sacked Salehs was the former president's nephew, Tareq Saleh, who had been head of the presidential guard. Two prominent members of Ali Saleh's family remained in powerful military posts however after Friday's shakeup. They are Brig. Gen. Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is the former president's son and head of the Republican Guard, and Brig. Gen. Yahya Mohammed Abdullah Saleh, the former president's nephew and head of Central Security Forces. Minutes after the military decrees were announced, a senior opposition leader's residence was heavily shelled. Opposition parties condemned the attacks on the residential compound of Hameed al-Ahmar, president of the opposition Dialogue Committee. ""Attacks on al-Ahmar come in retaliation against the president's orders to remove senior Ali Saleh aides from their military positions,"" said Fowzy al-Jaradi, the spokesman for al-Ahmar's office. The military committee, the country's highest security authority, warned all political and military factions to be cautious and urged them to help in defusing the current tension. Opposition factions in Yemen have refused to participate in the anticipated national dialogue unless complete military reforms take place first. Anti-government demonstrators demanded last year that all of the former president's relatives be replaced. After months of massive street protests, Ali Abdullah Saleh finally stepped down in February in exchange for immunity, as part of a power transfer deal brokered by the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. However, he remained president of the ruling General People's Congress party. The restructuring of the military was part of the negotiated power transfer deal and was promised by the new president. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Officials: Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar threatens to bring down aircraft if his demands aren't met .

"(CNN) -- As coach of Namibia's national women's football team, Jacqui Shipanga is credited with changing attitudes to the sport. But to Shipanga football is more than a game -- it's a way to help society and improve the lives of girls around her country. ""I'm the type of coach at this point of time that is more willing to support social change and build and contribute towards nation building and reconciliation, instead of just the end result of what is happening on the pitch,"" she says. Shipanga recently launched a six-team women's super league in a bid to increase the pool and quality of players available for Namibia's national squad -- but that is not her only goal. ""For the players themselves, it keeps them off the street, it keeps them busy,"" she says. ""We've had a lot of teenage pregnancies in the past and nowadays girls are thinking of postponing that because there's a league coming. ""We will be touring to the other regions, to the other towns, but all in all it's about exposing their skills and showing their abilities in what they can do."" For Shipanga, coaching the national side of a country with a history of racial segregation and a present dominated by struggles against poverty and HIV/AIDS comes with additional responsibilities. ""We are a nation currently ranked top in the world with regard to the HIV infection rate and we have seen a decrease in terms of teenage pregnancy of all the girls that are part of all the leagues that are part of our programs,"" says Shipanga. ""We have seen how parents are also coming out on different days that we are launching for HIV and AIDS testing and this is obviously very important for our country,"" she adds. ""That's why we have seen big organizations such as UNICEF investing in girls' football ... in order to raise awareness regarding social change."" Initiatives like ""Galz & Goals,"" sponsored by UNICEF, aim to use football as a platform to raise awareness of health and social responsibility in Namibia. Women's football might be contributing to society now, but 35-year-old Shipanga remembers that things were very different when she was growing up in the southern African country . ""A girl couldn't play football, not even participate in sports,"" she recalls. ""Just running, normal jogging, was regarded as taboo."" Although football has always been part of life in Namibia, for years it was culturally unacceptable for girls to participate in the sport. Those perceptions failed to deter Shapinga from following her passion for the game. Shapinga's football journey began some two decades ago, playing with the boys of her neighborhood despite the disapproval of her family and community. ""Girls were not encouraged to participate in sport because there were all these different type of myths: you're not going to be fertile, you're not going to get married one day, you're not going to have the so-called happy ending that would make any mother proud,"" Shapinga says. Unfazed by the difficulties, she continued to play her favorite sport during her college years, when she started making a name for herself. Word of her talent quickly spread and when a women's national football squad was formed in the early 2000s she was called up. In 2006 she was made national coach and soon caught the eye of football governing body FIFA, which appointed her an international coaching instructor in 2008. Shapinga, who's also a member of FIFA's world cup technical study group, says that women's football is today the number one female sport in Namibia. Despite that, Namibia is ranked 114th in the world and has only recently started investing in grooming young talent. But while the country struggles to compete on the international stage, Shipanga says the success of projects like ""Galz & Goals"" is having a positive impact on communities and is boosting the self esteem of the young girls participating. ""The girls are getting the necessary respect in the community because everyone is asking them: Are you also part of the football team?'"" she says. ""They are seen as role models within the communities and I think it's really awesome.""","Jacqui Shipanga is the coach of Namibia's national women's football team .

"New York (CNN) -- Now goalkeeper for the New York Red Bulls, as a child growing up in Senegal, Bouna Coundoul could only dream of being a professional footballer. At the age of 14 Coundoul was sent to study in the unfamiliar surroundings of New York. But his passion for football followed him across the Atlantic. ""When I moved from Senegal to the United States in 1997, I didn't know that in the United States they played soccer -- all I thought is basketball or whatever,"" he says. ""So coming here and seeing that soccer is well developed here, I went to high school."" Coundoul's shot-stopping talents started flourishing in his new environment. He soon made a splash on the local football scene as a talented goalie while playing in high school. ""In the United States, education can open the doors of any opportunity that you want, so when I went to high school, people started seeing, 'oh this guy has some talent, this guy can make it.'"" In 2005 he fulfilled his dream of competing at the top level by signing for American Major League Soccer (MLS) team the Colorado Rapids. These days he sports the red and white colors of the New York Red Bulls, whose fans have taken him to their hearts. On match days, a certain catch phrase can often be heard echoing around the team's imposing stadium: ""It's Bouna Time."" It's a phrase Coundoul lives by, defining his attitude toward both football and life. ""The way I see it, the way I kind of come up with it (is to) be the best on the field,"" he explains. ""Whatever you do in life, as long as it's positive, it can be Bouna Time."" ""Try to do everything at your max so after, later on, you don't regret anything. That's why Bouna Time is all about (being) positive."" Coundoul says he's developed a special relationship with his team's fans: ""As soon as I step on the field ... you can hear it. 'What time is it? It's Bouna Time.' And that really makes me feel like, OK, these guys are on my side, they really believe in me. ""I make sure I give them a good show so every time they come, they know it's going to be Bouna Time."" Now a teammate of French football legend Thierry Henry, Coundoul says he cherishes the moments he's on the same field as some of the sport's biggest names. ""Thierry Henry, David Beckham, Rafael Marquez, Samuel Eto'o -- all those guys that back in the day I used to sit and dream and watch those guys play, now we're in the same field, playing with those guys, or against them,"" he says. ""I think that's a dream come true. Any soccer player would love to have that opportunity."" Coundoul's eye-catching performances in the MLS have also earned him a place in Senegal's national team. ""I represent it with pride, with honor,"" he says. ""I want to serve the country the best way possible, which is playing soccer."" In 2007 he found another way to help his country on a deeper level, with the creation of the Bouna Time Academy, which provides after-school football training for some 60 children, and organizes matches for them at the weekend. But Coundoul says that only top students are accepted by the academy. He wants the young athletes to understand that while few of them will have the chance to be professional footballers, their education can take them anywhere. ""I tell them, once you get your education, anything is possible,"" he says. ""Even if you don't become a professional soccer player, you can become the next president. ""If you get your education, you can travel, you can read, you can do everything you want to do, and you can carry yourself in a way that they say, 'this guy is professional all the time.'""","Bouna Coundoul is New York Red Bulls' Senegalese goalkeeper .

"(CNN) -- Bobby Petrino has been fired as head football coach at the University of Arkansas, the school's athletics director said Tuesday. Petrino's lack of candor about his ""personal and professional relationship"" with a female employee who was riding with him on a motorcycle that crashed earlier this month was key to the decision, Jeff Long told reporters. ""Coach Petrino knowingly misled the athletics department and the university about the circumstances related to his accident,"" Long said in a news conference at the university's baskeball arena in Fayetteville. Though the 51-year-old coach had ""multiple opportunities"" over four days after the accident to be forthcoming, ""he chose not to."" Petrino had been placed on paid administrative leave last week after it was revealed he had not disclosed that Jessica Dorrell, a 25-year-old female member of his staff, was on his motorcycle with him when it crashed on April 1 and that he had given her unfairly favorable treatment in hiring her on his staff. Long said Petrino had been fired with cause, meaning the university is not obligated to pay out his contract. University Chancellor G. David Gearhart issued a statement Tuesday saying the coach's contract ""establishes a process by which he may have his termination decision reviewed. Under that process, the review would ultimately come to me for consideration and action. ""Given my role in the review process as chancellor, I must decline further comment on today's announcement."" Petrino issued a statement Tuesday night saying he takes responsibility for what happened and apologizing for, among other things, putting Long ""in the position of having to sort through my mistakes."" ""The simplest response I have is: I'm sorry,"" Petrino said in the statement. ""These two words seem very inadequate. But that is my heart. All I have been able to think about is the number of people I've let down by making selfish decisions. I've taken a lot of criticism in the past. Some deserved, some not deserved. This time, I have no one to blame but myself."" Petrino also said, ""I have hurt my wife, Becky, and our four children. I've let down the University of Arkansas, my team, coaching staff and everyone associated with the Razorback football program."" He also said his ""sole focus at this point is trying to repair the damage I've done to my family. They did not ask for any of this and deserve better. I am committed to being a better husband, father and human being as a result of this and will work each and every day to prove that to my family, friends and others."" Long said his review of the case ""raised several concerns which led me to look beyond the accident itself,"" Long said, citing ""the process and circumstances that influenced his decision to hire (Dorrell) as a direct-report member of his staff, and his candor and behavior as a member of my staff."" Long said Petrino had had a ""consensual relationship"" with Dorrell, and that Petrino had given Dorrell ""some $20,000"" and failed to disclose their relationship when recommending her for the job with the department, thereby giving her ""an unfair and undisclosed advantage for a position on his football staff."" Dorrell, Long said, was one of 159 applicants for the job. ""By itself, Coach Petrino's consensual relationship with Miss Dorrell prior to her joining the football staff was not against university policy,"" Long said. ""By itself, it's a matter between individuals and their families. ""However, in this case, Coach Petrino abused his authority when over the past few weeks he made a staff decision and personal choices that benefited himself"" and compromised the university, Long said. He said Petrino also ""engaged in a pattern of misleading and manipulative behavior designed to deceive me and members of the athletics staff both before and after the accident,"" Long said. Petrino told the police investigating the crash that the sun and wind had caused him to lose control and crash into a pile of dirt and tree limbs on the side of the road, according to the police report. ""He made a choice to return to practice (last) Tuesday, to hold a press conference and to demonstrate his physical resiliency and command of his program, all the time failing to correct the initial report that he was the only person involved in the accident. He made a conscious decision to speak and mislead the public on Tuesday."" In four seasons as head coach, Petrino led the Razorbacks to a 34-17 record, including an 11-2 record last season that included a victory in the Cotton Bowl. Arkansas finished the season ranked among the top five college teams in the nation. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The simplest response I have is: I'm sorry,"" Petrino says in statement .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets is free to play in the Champions League final against Manchester United after UEFA dismissed an allegation of racism by Real Madrid. Real posted a video on their official web site which, they claimed, showed Busquets shouting towards Marcelo during their match at the Bernabeu. The footage was captioned ""mono, mono"", which means ""monkey"" in Spanish. An ill-tempered semifinal that saw two players sent off and Real manager Jose Mourinho sent to the stands finished 2-0 to Spanish champions Barca, who then secured their place in the final with a 1-1 draw in the second leg at the Nou Camp. But the European game's governing body have decided there is no ""strong and convincing evidence"" to impose a ban on Busquets that would have forced him to sit out the showpiece final at Wembley on May 28. Ronaldo matches La Liga scoring record . A statement on UEFA's web site read: ""The report lodged by Real Madrid CF concerning racial abuse against Marcelo by FC Barcelona player Sergio Busquets has been dismissed due to a lack of strong and convincing evidence."" UEFA also confirmed they had dismissed an appeal from by Real regarding to an original complaint they had made about the behavior of Barcelona's players during the first leg in Madrid. Real accused their rivals of ""premeditated anti-sporting behavior"" and claimed Barcelona's players dived and tried to influence the referee during the game. The billion-dollar grudge match: The enormity of El Clasico . UEFA banned Mourinho for five games and fined him $71,000 after he was sent to the stands during the game for sarcastically applauding the referee and later claiming Barca's relationship with charity UNICEF meant they had too much power in football. Meanwhile, Barcelona have announced an extension to their arrangement with UNICEF, which will see them carry the charity's logo on their shirts. The club have had an arrangement with UNICEF, who are the world's leading organization protecting the rights of children and young people, for five years. UEFA also announced Monday that England, Norway and Sweden will be awarded another place in the Europa League next season due to the country's standings in the Fair Play rankings.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Max Page, the 7-year-old who played a mini-Darth Vader in a Volkswagen commercial, Monday left a hospital in Los Angeles where he had undergone heart surgery. ""I'm feeling great,"" a squirmy and smiley Max told a room full of reporters on his way out the door. ""I do feel a little pain in my chest, but not much."" Asked what he was planning to do next, he said: ""Well, I'm excited about a lot of things -- especially having a milkshake."" Max was born with Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect that in this case affected the function of his pulmonary valve, which helps the flow of blood through the heart. After a number of measures to preserve his pulmonary valve, doctors replaced it last week with a porcine valve that should last 10 to 15 years, according to the website of the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. ""We're hopeful that this will be -- quite possibly -- the last major surgery that Max will need,"" said Michael Silka, co-director of The Heart Institute at the hospital. Max is best-known for playing the role of a mini-Darth Vader character in a Super Bowl advertisement for Volkswagen. In the ad, he goes around his parents' house trying to use ""The Force"" on various household items without much success. He tries the washer and dryer. A doll. A sandwich. Nothing happens. Not even the family dog is moved. But when he tries to wield ""The Force"" on his dad's new car, the engine roars to life -- with a little help from dad and his keyfob, of course. You can almost see Max's eyes, wide-open with amazement, as he holds his arms out and turns to his unseen parents as if to say, ""Did you see that?"" ""Star Wars"" fans might note Max bears some resemblance to the actor who played young Anakin Skywalker, who later turned into Darth Vader. And fans are also comparing him to a young Mark Hamill, who played Vader's son, Luke Skywalker. Not that any of it means much to Max. He still hasn't seen any of the movies.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The Japanese defense minister said Friday that he had ordered the country's military to prepare a missile defense system ahead of a planned rocket launch by North Korea next month. North Korea said last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch between April 12 and 16, alarming countries around the region. South Korea has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear-armed missile, while the United States has warned the move would jeopardize a food-aid agreement reached with Pyongyang in early March. Naoki Tanaka, the Japanese defense minister, said at a news conference Friday that he had requested that officials get ready for the deployment of anti-missile PAC3 and Eagis ships ahead of the launch. The Japanese government is also considering deploying a PAC3 missile defense system in Okinawa. Tanaka said he would visit Okinawa soon in preparation for such a move. Tanaka had said Monday that he would consider ordering the destruction of the projectile if it presented a risk to Japan. North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch. In a recent notice to the International Maritime Organization regarding the ""launch of an earth observation satellite,"" the North Korean government provided notice of where the anticipated drop zones would be for the two-stage rocket. The notice was signed by North Korea's director general of its maritime administration, Ko Nung Du, and advised the launch would take place between 7 a.m. and noon, local time, on one of the expected days. The rocket's path will go over ""the South Korean islands of Baegryeong-do, Daecheong-do and Socheong-do, and then across open water until it passes between Japan's Miyako and Ishigaki islands before heading further south,"" according to the North Korea Tech blog which first obtained the North Korea documents and has plotted the coordinates. The expected drop zones of the two-stage rocket are off the western coast of South Korea and to the east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, according to the blog. CNN's Adam Levine contributed to this report.","North Korea's announcement of a planned satellite launch has provoked alarm .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities have filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of a stolen dinosaur skeleton and its return to Mongolia, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar was looted from Mongolia's Gobi Desert and brought to the United States illegally, the U.S. Attorney's Office and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a joint statement Monday. ""The skeletal remains of this dinosaur are of tremendous cultural and historic significance to the people of Mongolia and provide a connection to the country's prehistoric past,"" said Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Mongolia tries to stop sale of dinosaur fossil . The Tyrannosaurus bataar skeleton was allegedly brought to the United States from Great Britain in March 2010. Upon entering, smugglers allegedly listed the skeleton's value at $15,000, while the auction value was listed as $950,000 to $1.5 million. Additionally, the skeleton's country of origin was listed as Great Britain. Tyrannosaurus bataar skeletons have only been recovered in Mongolia. Despite a court order submitted by the government of Mongolia and granted by a Texas State Civil District judge prohibiting the auction, sale, release or transfer of the skeleton, it was sold at auction for more than $1 million. Paleontologists recently determined the skeleton was unearthed from the Gobi Desert sometime from 1995 to 2005. ""When the skeleton was allegedly looted, a piece of the country's natural history was stolen with it, and we look forward to returning it to its rightful place,"" Bharara said. Court documents state the skeleton is in the custody of Cadogan Tate Fine Art in Sunnyside, New York. Cadogan Tate was not immediately available for comment. Mongolia enacted laws in 1924 criminalizing the exportation of dinosaur fossils from the country.

"New York (CNN) -- The suspect in the ""Dating Game Killer"" case has pleaded not guilty to murder charges in connection with the deaths of two women in New York in the 1970s. Rodney Alcala, 68, was arraigned Thursday after being escorted by U.S. Marshals to New York from California, where he had been on death row since 2010 for killing four women and a 12-year-old girl there. The California murders took place between November 1977 and June 1979 and covered a wide swath of suburban Los Angeles, from Burbank to El Segundo. Last year, prosecutors in New York charged Alcala with murder in the deaths of Cornelia Crilley and Ellen Hover. Crilley, a 23-year-old TWA flight attendant, was found raped and strangled inside her Upper East Side apartment in June 1971, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said in a news release at the time of the indictment in January 2011. Hover, also 23 and living in Manhattan, was found dead in Westchester County in 1977, it said. ""Cold cases are not forgotten cases -- our prosecutors, investigators and partners in the NYPD do not give up,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in the statement. In 1978, Alcala was a winning bachelor on the television show ""The Dating Game."" At the time, he had been convicted in the 1968 rape of an 8-year-old girl and served a 34-month sentence, authorities said. Police found dozens of photographs of women and children in a storage locker Alcala kept in Seattle. The locker also contained earrings belonging to Robin Samsoe, his 12-year-old victim, according to the Orange County, California, district attorney's office. Serial killer had photo stash . Authorities asked for the public's help in determining whether any of the people in the photographs were victims of Alcala's. A year before his appearance on the game show, Alcala raped, sodomized and killed 18-year-old Jill Barcomb and 27-year-old nurse Georgia Wixted in California, prosecutors said. He smashed in Barcomb's face with a rock and strangled her by tying a belt and pants leg around her neck, prosecutors said. Her body was discovered in a mountainous area in the foothills near Hollywood. Wixted was beaten with the claw end of a hammer and strangled with a nylon stocking, authorities said. Her body was left in her Malibu apartment. During his appearance on ""The Dating Game,"" Alcala was introduced as a ""successful photographer"" who might also be found skydiving or motorcycling. In June 1979, Alcala beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, authorities said. That same month, he raped and murdered Jill Parenteau, 21, strangling her with a cord or a stocking in her Burbank apartment, they said. Alcala's blood was collected from the scene after he cut himself crawling out a window, the prosecutor said, adding, ""Based on a semi-rare blood match, Alcala was linked to the murder."" He was charged with murdering Parenteau, but the case was dismissed after he was convicted of killing Samsoe. Alcala approached her at the beach in Huntington Beach in 1979 and asked her to pose for pictures, authorities said. She did, they said, and Alcala then kidnapped and murdered her, dumping her body in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Alcala was convicted of Samsoe's death in 1980 and sentenced to death, but the California Supreme Court overturned his conviction. A second trial, in 1986, also resulted in a death sentence, but it was overturned by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. As he awaited a third trial, Alcala's DNA was linked to the crime scenes in the Barcomb, Wixted and Lamb cases, and he was charged with killing them and Parenteau. Jed Mills, who was ""Bachelor No. 2"" on ""The Dating Game"" alongside Alcala's ""Bachelor No. 1,"" recalled that he had an almost immediate aversion to him. ""Something about him, I could not be near him,"" Mills said last year. Alcala succeeded in charming bachelorette Cheryl Bradshaw from the other side of the game show's wall. But she declined the date that the show offered them: tennis lessons, tennis clothes and a trip to an amusement park. Tips pour in after release of serial killer's photos .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona booked a place in the European Champions League semifinals after convincingly beating AC Milan 3-1 on Tuesday, but the victory didn't come without its controversies. Inevitably, it was Barcelona's Lionel Messi who was center stage, scoring two first-half penalties -- his 50th and 51st in the competition -- that set the Catalan club on their way following the 0-0 draw in Italy last week. Milan, however, will bitterly contest both spot kicks. The first saw Messi win, and then convert, a penalty in the 11th minute after Luca Antonini clipped the diminutive striker's heels. Milan equalized through Antonio Nocerino, briefly putting the Italians through on away goals if the score stayed that way. But a second penalty was awarded after veteran Italy international Alessandro Nesta was controversially adjudged to have tugged Sergio Busquets' shirt. In the end Andrei Iniesta's second-half goal -- inevitably set up by Messi -- gave the home side a comfortable buffer and left Pep Guardiola's team on course to defend their title. The coach said both spot kicks were warranted, and came after a first leg in which Braca were denied a penalty despite Alexis Sanchez being brought down. ""They were penalties. We didn't complain in the away leg and we won't complain now,"" Guardiola said. ""Grabbing players in the area should be penalized and they are penalties. On television, it's a penalty."" The victory sets up a semifinal date with either Chelsea or Benfica, who play Wednesday, but all eyes will be on a possible ""dream final"" between Barcelon and Real Madrid in Munich on May 19. Not everyone wants to see an all-Spanish final. Bayern Munich ran out convincing 4-0 aggregate winners against French side Marseille after winning 2-0 on Tuesday at the Allianz Arena, where the final will take place. Two first-half goals from Ivica Olic put the tie beyond Marseille, giving the German side hope of enjoying home advantage next month. The Croatian striker started the match as Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes could afford to rest top scorer Mario Gomez and Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who both scored last week. Unless Cypriot underdogs APOEL Nicosia can overcome a three-goal deficit at Real Madrid on Wednesday, Bayern will likely face Jose Mourinho's side in the semifinals.","Barcelona beat Milan 3-1 to secure a Champions League semifinal spot .

"(CNN) -- A 6-year-old girl, detained in Arizona on suspicion of entering the United States illegally, is now at a shelter in El Paso, Texas, as authorities try to locate a relative. The girl, who told authorities she is from El Salvador, had to be moved to El Paso because there is no room in Arizona shelters for minors in her situation, said Jose Joaquin Chacon, the consul general for El Salvador in Arizona. The girl was traveling with her mother through Mexico, Chacon said, but for some unknown reason the mother apparently turned her daughter over to smugglers at the U.S. border and separated from her. Immigration shift sparks reaction from both sides . The unaccompanied child was detained along with 15 other people traveling in a van through Maricopa County late Friday, hours after President Barack Obama had announced a decision to stop deporting certain young illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for at least five years. The people in the van were planning to make their way to a variety of destinations around the country -- including New York, California and Texas -- according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough stance against illegal immigration, is a vocal opponent of President Obama's immigration policies. ""There was no politics involved in this,"" he said. ""And when you have a 6-year-old girl, I think that's newsworthy regardless of what the circumstances are -- whether you call it an arrest or a detention."" For illegal immigrant graduates, a 'leap of faith as been answered' A spokesman for the sheriff's office explained that the girl ""was not arrested in the sense of handcuffed and booked into jail. However, she was detained in our custody and turned over to ICE officials."" After the sheriff's office handed the girl over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, she was placed in ""the care and custody"" of the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, said Amber Cargile, an ICE spokeswoman. The girl ended up in El Paso, Chacon said. Overheard on CNN.com: Decision to defer some deportations symbolic . Most of those detained were being held in jail, the sheriff's statement said. Last week, Arpaio said that the Obama administration's new directive not to deport some young migrants was motivated by politics. Arpaio said he would abide by the directive but continue to enforce state laws on illegal immigration as he sees fit. The rule change will allow people younger than 30 who had come to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and have been successful students or served in the military to apply for a two-year deferral from deportation. Individuals must be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. Photos: Lens on immigration -- adolescence deported .

"(CNN) -- China will launch its historic space docking mission Saturday along with its first female astronaut in space. Liu Yang has been selected to join two male astronauts, Jing Haipeng and Liu Wang, as part of a three-person crew aboard the Shenzhou-9, according to China's manned space docking program, which says the mission will last 10 days. A launch time is set for 6:37 p.m. local time (6:37 a.m. ET) at a satellite center in northwestern Gansu province. The carrier rocket, the Long March-2F, was scheduled to start fueling Friday afternoon, and the launch ground and control systems are ready, state media reported. Echoing a famous Chinese proverb, Wu Ping, a spokeswoman for China's manned space program said, ""Women hold up half the sky. Human space missions without women are incomplete."" Chinese women push for a place in space . According to Xinhua, Liu, 33, was the deputy head of a flight unit of the PLA's Air Force and an air force major. She is also a veteran pilot with 1,680 hours of flying experience and, after two years of training, excelled in testing before being selected with another female, Wang Yaping, as a candidate for the crew. On the eve of the mission, however, it was Liu who won the coveted spot. Wu said that the participation of women in space will aid training, improve flight crew equipment and expand knowledge on the physical and psychological effects of space on women. ""It will also further expand the social impact of human space missions and showcase the positive image of Chinese women,"" Wu said. ""As a woman, I am eagerly looking forward to this flight with a female astronaut."" In another milestone, Jing will be China's first astronaut to travel twice into space, Xinhua reported. Like his other two crewmembers, Jing is a former pilot of the People's Liberation Army and a member of the Communist Party of China, according to Xinhua. If all goes well, the Shenzhou-9 will dock with China's orbiting space laboratory, making the nation the third after the United States and Russia to complete a manned space docking. As a precaution in case of an emergency, one of the crewmembers will not board the lab, the space program said in February. China has big aspirations for its program and hopes to build a space station and conduct a manned mission to the moon. Read about China's space plans . The orbiting Tiangong-1 space lab module was launched into space in September, and two months later it successfully completed China's first space docking with an unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou-8, according to Xinhua news agency. The efforts demonstrate ""China's continued commitment to becoming a first-class space power with an independent space capability,"" Taylor Fravel, associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this year. ""This is a very exclusive club."" China's efforts come as the United States refocuses its space program toward deep space exploration, and private companies such as SpaceX make strides toward the commercialization of spaceflight. Last month, SpaceX's unmanned Dragon capsule completed the first commercial mission to the International Space Station.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Pilots for the Spanish airline Iberia resumed their strikes on Monday, forcing the cancellation of 124 flights, in a grievance over the company's new low-cost carrier, Iberia Express. The pilots see a threat to their jobs or working conditions from the budget airline, which started flying on March 25 despite 12 one-day pilots' strikes earlier this year. The earlier strikes cost the company 36 million euros ($47 million). Now the pilots have planned 30 more one-day strikes, every Monday and Friday, through July 20. On Monday, the 124 canceled flights were 38% of Iberia's 330 scheduled flights, a percentage of cancellations similar to the earlier strikes. Iberia, which had advance notice of Monday's strike, tried to place passengers, many returning from Easter vacations, on alternative flights. Iberia lost 98 million euros ($129 million) last year, especially on short and medium-range flights in Spain and nearby in Europe. It launched Iberia Express aiming to cut the costs of operating those routes, an Iberia spokeswoman said. But a spokeswoman for the pilots union said the new budget airline violates key points of a previous agreement between pilots and Iberia. The union has offered for pilots to take deep salary cuts if flying for Iberia Express, but negotiations broke off last month. Iberia has filed a court complaint, seeking to stop the strikes and demanding compensation. A ruling could still be weeks away. Iberia employs about 1,400 pilots. The airline has made deals with most other employees regarding the budget carrier. Iberia Express currently serves just four routes, all in Spain: Madrid to Palma de Mallorca, Malaga, Seville and Alicante. But by the end of this year, it expects to carry 2.5 million passengers to 20 destinations, including Dublin, Ireland; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Naples, Italy. The company would have 14 planes and 500 employees.","Iberia pilots plan a one-day strike every Monday and Friday until July .

"(CNN) -- A love story released in time for Valentine's Day, bringing together the stars of ""The Notebook"" (Rachel McAdams) and ""Dear John"" (Channing Tatum)? Sounds like a cookie-cutter chick flick, for sure. But ""The Vow"" surpasses low expectations, for this male film critic at any rate, if only because it hits on an intriguing yarn and plays it out with some respect for the characters involved. Tatum is Leo, a young man whose blissfully happy marriage is rear-ended by a snowplow -- propelling wife Paige (McAdams) through the windscreen and into a brain trauma unit. When she wakes up, she's okay -- except that she's wiped out the last five years entirely. She doesn't know Leo, doesn't remember dropping out of law school and switching to art classes, and doesn't like anything she finds in her wardrobe. She also doesn't remember cutting off her parents and her sister -- Leo's never even met them before -- or why she broke up with her fiancÃ©, Jeremy. Amnesia often figures as a handy crutch for thriller writers who love teasing out doubt and deception, but Michael Sucsy's movie is a different beast, a romance first and foremost, but a romance that claims to be inspired by a true story. Sucsy (who directed Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange in ""Grey Gardens"") plays down the condition's inherent paranoia, in part by drawing us in through the eyes of the husband, Leo. Here's a guy who loves his wife, but who finds himself alone in the marriage because everything they shared as a couple has been erased. For Paige, home is the house she grew up in and the parents she remembers -- wealthy, privileged suburbanites who are only too keen to set back the clock and pretend their little girl never strayed across the tracks. An actor who finds ""perplexed and concerned"" well within his limited range, Channing Tatum is a good fit for the bruised and brooding Leo, and the lively Rachel McAdams has some nice moments as the (blank?) Paige -- but flashbacks to happier days try too hard to force a chemistry that remains more theoretical than felt. Still, the scenario (Sucsy is one of five credited writers) throws up some arresting questions about the nature of love. How can Leo still be in love with this woman who is a stranger to herself? Can he make her fall back in love with him? Is it even fair to try? Because these ideas are also emotional dilemmas the movie works surprisingly well despite its shortcuts and shortcomings. It certainly isn't subtle about its preference for the sympathetic Leo -- and by extension, the vegan, tattooed, artistic Paige who voted for Obama -- over her domineering father, played by Sam Neill, and the conservative values he represents -- even though the uptown scenes are generally better written and more convincingly played than what amounts to a sitcom notion of bohemian chic. Of course it's more than a little convenient that Paige never stops to ask why she walked out on the life she was groomed for -- the story's second, hidden trauma. If she had, the whole construct falls apart. But let that go. This is mostly a poignant and touching effort. Just as Leo woos his estranged wife with ""Chocolate roulette"" (not a game Rachel McAdams plays very often I'm betting), given the choice between hard edges and gooey centers, Sucsy invariably heads for the fudge: it's sweet and chewy and fun to share.","""The Vow"" hits on an intriguing yarn and plays it out .

"(CNN) -- The tech world has been up in arms this past week about ""Silicon Valley,"" an upcoming Bravo reality show documenting the lives of five aspiring entrepreneurs making their way in the world of Bay Area startups. The TV show is co-produced by Randi Zuckerberg, former marketing director of Facebook and sister of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. Its brief preview showcases the glamorous life of a tech startup founder: Lots of parties, alcohol, attractive women and a social scene that is like ""high school, but it's only the smart kids."" The problem: The tech industry isn't like that at all. Here's how tech-company founders usually succeed in Silicon Valley: They spend endless hours in front of a computer building products people want to use. Alas, this doesn't make for interesting TV. Hence all the Hollywood cliches. Computers on TV shows and in movies beep when a button is pressed. Characters seem able to type at a frenetic pace. Passwords can always be guessed within three attempts -- and always just in time to prevent a disaster. These cliches once existed only in fictional shows and movies. Alas, as Silicon Valley continues to power a digital revolution that's changing the world at a rapid pace, camera crews are increasingly trying to capture startup reality and bottle it as entertainment. And they're finding it converts to film about as well as paint drying. Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook through thousands of hours spent in front of a dimly glowing screen. His motive? He ""likes to build things."" And yet in 2010's ""The Social Network,"" the Zuckerberg onscreen is more concerned with girls, parties and getting into Harvard's most exclusive social circles. Therein lies the second issue with bringing startups to the big or small screen: Startup founders rarely have interesting social lives. Building a company takes almost every minute of the day, leaving little time for a personal life. TV viewers demand drama: If it can't be found, it's manufactured. The small screen loves a performer, too. A celebrity. An exhibitionist. Can you dance? Sing? Act? Even once the show is over, these outgoing stars convert well to a world of tabloids and celebrity magazines. Startup founders, however, do not. So now comes the time to pick a side. Is representing Silicon Valley as a party haven doing a disservice to those who work countless hours to build products we'll all love? Or is there nobility in Randi Zuckerberg's mission to ""make accessible and to humanize the increasingly important tech community for the average consumer""? Perhaps it's both. Translating tech for those not living in its epicenter is a noble effort that will surely bring more new people -- and more diversity -- to Silicon Valley. And yet this can't be done in a literal way: Bringing technologists' stories to TV and movies requires a little creativity to make the subject matter fit the medium. My science teacher didn't get our class interested in a science career by telling us that most chemists work long hours on repetitive tasks. No, he showed us explosions. And crazy, color-changing reactions. And non-Newtonian fluids dancing on speaker cones. It's unfortunate that the story of tech revolution doesn't convert well to the dominant medium of the day. And it's regrettable that some viewers will wildly misinterpret what entrepreneurship is all about. But after grabbing the attention of viewers with dramatic exothermic reactions -- or scenes of wild parties -- perhaps we'll be able to teach them what it really takes to build a company. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.","A Bravo reality show, ""Silicon Valley,"" will follow five aspiring tech entrepreneurs .

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Closing arguments in the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse trial could begin as soon as Thursday, Judge John Cleland said Monday. He said the defense will probably end its case midday Wednesday, followed by the prosecution's rebuttal. That should end Wednesday afternoon, clearing the way for closing arguments Thursday, less than two weeks after the start of what had been expected to be a three-week case. The defense case began Monday, but testimony ended early because of ""technical issues"" involving witnesses, Cleland told jurors. Sandusky, 68, is on trial on 51 counts related to accusations of improper conduct and sexual abuse involving at least 10 boys over a 15-year span. The former Penn State assistant coach has denied the charges. At the conclusion of the trial, jurors will be sequestered in a hotel so outside influences cannot affect their deliberations, Cleland said. Prosecutors wrapped up their case Monday morning with brief testimony from the mother of one of the alleged victims. ""He gave him clothes, he gave him gifts,"" the mother of an accuser called Victim 9 testified. ""I just wish he'd given him underwear to replace the underwear I could never find in my laundry."" The final prosecution witness testified Monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the time he was visiting Sandusky and sometimes did not want to visit the former Penn State assistant's home. But she said she did not ask him about any possible abuse and still does not know what happened to him. ""I didn't really want to hear,"" she said, crying. Sandusky's child sex abuse allegations: In his own words . The defense then opened its case with a former Penn State coach who testified about Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community. Richard Anderson said that it was not uncommon for coaches and youths to use the shower at the same time, and that he had never seen anything inappropriate between Sandusky and a child. Before Monday's testimony, Cleland rejected defense arguments that the charges were too vague or the testimony did not support the claims. Prosecutors did withdraw one charge of unlawful contact with a minor involving one of the defendants. The law was not in effect during the time the alleged misconduct occurred, prosecutors said. That left 51 charges pending against Sandusky. A main focus of the defense's strategy may be to attempt to poke holes in the prosecution's case thus far. ""A lot of people lied,"" lawyer Joe Amendola said last Monday in his opening statement. Over four days, several people testified that Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts with him in various places, including showers in the Penn State coaches' locker room, hotel rooms and the basement of his home. 'Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation, betrayal . One told jurors that Sandusky -- whom he met, like many of the accusers, through the Second Mile nonprofit for disadvantaged youths that the ex-coach founded -- had threatened him if he told others about the abuse. Another said Sandusky warned he might send him home from a trip to Texas, where they'd gone to watch a Penn State bowl game, if he resisted the sexual advances. ""There's a tsunami of evidence against him,"" veteran criminal defense attorney Ron Kuby said. The defense could challenge the accusers' timetable, questioning if Sandusky could have committed the crimes they claim he did, when they say he did them. Some of the accusers have civil attorneys, Amendola noted last week, calling that unusual. Others, he said, have a financial interest in the case, an allegation that was denied by the accusers and their attorneys. But Howard Janet, who represents the accuser known as Victim 6, blasted Amendola's assertion that his client and others detailed the abuse just so they could sue Sandusky, calling it nonsense. ""Does that mean that none of them are telling the truth, because they've gone to hire a lawyer?"" he said. ""That's absurd."" The defense is expected to call an expert witness to testify that Sandusky may have histrionic personality disorder, which the National Institutes of Health says describes people who act ""in a very emotional and dramatic way that draws attention to themselves."" What is histrionic personality disorder? The prosecution had presented as evidence what one accuser described as ""creepy love letters,"" written by Sandusky, that they argued were part of ""grooming techniques"" commonly employed by sexual predators. Judge Cleland issued an order Friday allowing a defense motion to offer expert testimony from a psychologist who ""will explain that the words, tones, requests and statements made in the letters are consistent with a person who suffers from a Histrionic Personality Disorder."" ""The goal of a person suffering from this disorder in writing those letters would not necessarily be to groom or sexually consummate a relationship in a criminal manner, but rather to satisfy the needs of a psyche belabored by the needs of such a disorder,"" the defense lawyers wrote in their motion. Sandusky was expected to be examined Sunday by a prosecution psychologist related to the personality disorder defense, according to a source with knowledge with the case. It was not clear if that happened. Another person who could testify is Dottie Sandusky, the accused ex-coach's wife. While many alleged victims knew her, she is not accused of having witnessed any sexual abuse. Lastly, there's the question of whether Sandusky himself will take the stand. Amendola told jurors last week that Sandusky routinely ""got showers with kids"" after working out and that he would say so later. Kuby, the defense lawyer, said having the former coach testify may give him his best chance at avoiding jail time. ""Just maybe he can convince one juror to hold out,"" the lawyer said. ""A hung jury, right now, is a lot better than life without parole."" Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan accused Sudan of launching ground and aerial attacks inside South Sudan's territory Sunday. ""There have been bombings since 9 this morning, and at 1 o'clock they launched a ground attack,"" said Barnaba Marial Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information. The clashes came after the southern army said it withdrew troops from a contested, oil-rich border region. A spokesman for the Sudanese military could not be immediately reached for comment. Claims from both sides are difficult to confirm, as journalists and independent observers do not have access to the front lines. South Sudan announced Friday that it would comply with a request from the United Nations Security Council to pull troops out of the disputed oil-rich region of Heglig, which it had occupied since April 10. Sudan claimed its forces had forced southern troops out and captured the area. Benjamin said his country's army withdrew to bases near the border and inside South Sudan. Sudanese forces crossed the border and attacked them there, he said. ""They are trying to drag us back into a war, and that's what the Security Council didn't want,"" he said. ""They must tell them to stop these attacks."" Benjamin said the bases near the border have been repeatedly attacked in the past by Sudanese troops based in Heglig, and those previous attacks prompted South Sudan to occupy the area. Heglig is on the border created last year when the two countries split. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir had vowed to ""never give up"" the disputed region. While both countries claim Heglig, Sudan continued administering the region after South Sudan declared independence last July following a two-decade civil war. The south took with it three quarters of the formerly united country's oil reserves, a loss that sent Sudan's economy reeling. Sudan's oil industry suffered further when fighting in Heglig forced a halt to oil production in those fields, which account for about half of the country's entire production of 115,000 barrels a day. Satellite images suggest that infrastructure in the Heglig oil fields may have been severely damaged by the fighting. The Satellite Sentinel Project released images Sunday that suggest a critical part of the oil pipeline infrastructure was destroyed. The collection manifold, which allows oil flows to be separated or combined without interrupting the flow, appears to have been damaged by an explosion. ""The evident destruction of the collection manifold is a big deal in that this by itself is likely to result in immediate cessation of oil flow from the area,"" said Jonathan Hutson, a spokesman for the project, which is led by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. Hutson said analysts could not determine whether the destruction was the result of ground fighting or aerial bombardment. On Friday, South Sudan's military spokesman, Philip Aguer, told reporters in Juba that Sudan had bombed Heglig's central processing facility the previous day and that it continued to burn. Serious damage to the facility would prevent companies from resuming production and would require substantial investment to repair or rebuild. Sudan has accused South Sudan of destroying oil infrastructure and said it would attempt to force South Sudan to pay for damages. The renewed fighting follows an appeal Saturday by U.S. President Barack Obama, urging the countries to ""choose peace"" and return to negotiations. ""You still have a chance to avoid being dragged back into war,"" he said in a video, which was subtitled in Arabic and posted to the White House website.","South Sudan's information minister reports hours of bombings .

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. had his nose bloodied midway through the fight, but maintained his poise to remain undefeated and claim the WBA junior middleweight title from Miguel Cotto. Mayweather won by unanimous decision on Saturday night. The 35-year-old (43-0, 26 KOs) was tested early and often by Cotto (37-3, 32 KOs), but the five-division champion started to pull away in the later rounds. Two judges scored the fight 117-111 and the third judge gave it 118-110. After the judges' decision, sold-out crowds booed Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. ""When it's pay-per-view and the fans are paying and the fans are coming out to see you, you want to give the fans excitement,"" Mayweather said. Cotto, 31, gave Mayweather all he could handle, tagging his competitor with shots to the head most of the night. But Mayweather was more accurate with his punches. In the end, Cotto earned the respect of his opponent. ""You're a hell of a champion,"" Mayweather said. ""You're the toughest guy I ever fought."" After the fight, Mayweather was asked about the likelihood of facing Manny Pacquiao -- something boxing fans have wanted for years. ""If you're the best, take the test,"" Mayweather said, referring to his insistence that Pacquaio submit to Olympic-style drug testing and has served as a stumbling block to making the fight happen. Pacquiao has said he would agree to such testing. Regardless, Mayweather's next fight will have to wait.

"(CNN) -- Monday morning, as we scrambled to get Luna off to school, there came a moment when the timeline of my life leapt into fast-forward. I was carrying around an iPad turned to CNN, checking in to see what news awaited me at work, while Luna danced around me, knowing my partner or I would turn off the TV if watching it slowed her down. Then, suddenly, something brought us to a halt. ""President Barack Obama is speaking at Barnard College today,"" the news reader said. Our eyes widened, and we shot each other a smile. The president was speaking at Mama's school. I had arrived at Barnard in 1983, fresh from a school run by Jesuit priests, where gay groups were banned from the premises. A boy I'd known had been severely harassed for being gay. Barnard was a long step better, but on the first day of college, my dorm mates fell into silence when one young woman delivered this news: ""I have two mothers,"" she said. I remember asking whether one was her stepmother. ""No. My mothers are gay,"" she said. ""They had me together."" She looked so uncomfortable, and no one was stepping up to make her feel any better. Back then, Barnard had openly gay and lesbian professors and a group for students who were gay. But in 1983, it was still not cool to be a lesbian; AIDS was beginning to surface on campus, and discussions over sexuality and condom use quickly became explosive. Barnard, a Seven Sisters women's college, had been embroiled in a battle over whether to merge with Columbia University's men's college, Columbia College, where Barack Obama was graduating that year. The buzz at Barnard was that nobody wanted it to be known as a college for ""dykes."" It was just another political debate to me. I was happily dating a wonderful guy, and it didn't affect me. Sexuality is a complicated thing. Sudden pressure to get 'gay married' That was the same year Evan Wolfson started a thesis at Harvard Law School on why gay people should have the freedom to marry. He had read an award-winning book by John Boswell, a prominent Yale professor, who argued that Christianity, particularly Catholicism, had once been OK with homosexuality. Wolfson believed that if things had once been different, there was an opening for society to reconsider. He made this argument: ""You can't say you're for equality if you acquiesce to exclusion from the central social and legal institution of society, which is marriage."" I'm her mom, not the nanny! He spent a career saying marriage rights could be the agent for social change around attitudes toward homosexuality, which prompted some folks to tell him he was flat-out nuts. In 1991, he served as co-counsel in a lawsuit by a group of Hawaiian gay couples against the state, alleging that it was unconstitutional for the state to forbid two people of the same sex to marry. In 1996, their Supreme Court agreed. Wolfson has launched a national movement toward allowing gays the freedom to marry. By 2001, 10 countries allowed gays to marry. By 2005, our neighbors in Canada granted marriage licenses to gays, and my partner and I attended our first wedding of a couple who had traveled there from the U.S. to wed. I remember the voice of this heterosexual justice of the peace cracking as he called himself a participant in history in the making. What a distance we have traveled as a society, even as our country debates whether allowing gay couples to marry is the right thing to do. There are six U.S. states that now allow gay couples to marry and an additional 12 that offer domestic partnerships or civil unions that are similar to marriage. There are 30 states that ban them. The federal government recognizes none of these unions, thus denying the couples hundreds of significant federal marriage rights. Obama spoke at Barnard on Monday about how we arrived here and how much further we have to go: ""Young folks who marched and mobilized, who stood up and sat in from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, didn't just didn't do it for themselves. That's how we achieved voting rights. That's how we achieved workers' rights; that's how we achieved gay rights; that's how we've made this union more perfect."" 'Mama, would you please speak English?' A year after that wedding in Canada, my partner and I had our daughter, Luna, and were legally bound to her through a second parent adoption, even as we could not marry each other. Luna is now 6, an age when kids really can't conceive of the future but seem to find comfort in recounting the past. ""What was it like when I was a baby"" quickly reaches back to ""What was it like when you were a baby?"" So she had a broad smile the day I enrolled her at Bank Street Summer Camp and they told her she would be taking swim class at Barnard College. ""That's your college, Mama! Let's go see!"" she said and pulled me and my partner, Mafe, onto campus. I showed her the pool I barely touched as a student and bought her an electric blue sweatshirt with BARNARD emblazoned on the front. She could sense the emotion in my voice when I told her what a life-changing experience it had been for a first-generation American to go to an Ivy League school. Barnard used to say it ""makes women,"" and the confidence and smarts it instilled were something I want for her, too. I told her one too many times that she would have to study very hard to get in. She ran along the patio in front of buildings named for women who'd accomplished incredible things. I walked around with my partner, wondering whether we would ever be able to afford to send her to a place so great, where I once met a girl raised by two mommies who struggled to explain herself and find support. Monday afternoon, 594 young women, in their light blue caps and gowns, graduate from Barnard College of Columbia University. They will honor Rosa Alonzo, a former trustee and an out lesbian Latina, for her contributions to the university. Wolfson received the same medal of distinction Barnard gave to the president of the United States, days after Obama declared his personal support for marriage rights for gays. Obama called upon the women at Barnard to change society for the better as the women who raised him had taught him, to persevere -- that in this country, ""no matter who you love or what God you worship, you can still purse your own happiness."" This is my alma mater, the same college our little girl talks of attending some day because it's ""Mama's school,"" where it will be of absolutely no consequence that her mothers are gay.","Barack Obama spoke Monday at Barnard, Rose Arce's alma mater .

"(CNN) -- The civilian death toll mounted in Syria Wednesday as the U.N.-Arab League envoy for the country, Kofi Annan, considered a response from Syrian authorities to proposals laid out in weekend meetings, officials said. Annan ""has questions and is seeking answers,"" said a statement by his spokesman. ""But given the grave and tragic situation on the ground, everyone must realize that time is of the essence. As he said in the region, this crisis cannot be allowed to drag on."" The opposition said 56 people died Wednesday across Syria, including 29 in the rebel stronghold of Idlib, where activists reported Syrian military forces had seized control following a four-day onslaught. Only pockets of the city were held by soldiers who have defected, the activists said. Annan met last weekend in Damascus with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to of reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis, which began almost a year ago. Three U.S. administration officials said earlier that al-Assad doesn't recognize the former U.N. secretary-general as the Arab League's representative and had rejected Annan's efforts. Al-Assad also said he will not do anything until the opposition lays down its arms, the sources said. Annan will brief the U.N. Security Council on Friday, according to the United Kingdom's mission to the United Nations, which holds the Security Council presidency this month. World powers will continue to attempt to pressure al-Assad's regime and focus on getting humanitarian aid to Syrians, U.S. President Barack Obama said Wednesday at a news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The Syrian regime is being isolated politically, diplomatically and economically, by tightening sanctions, Obama said, while the Syrian opposition is growing stronger and military defections are continuing. Cameron said his country wants ""revolution rather than civil war"" in Syria. Syrian state-run media Wednesday said security forces ""have brought safety and security back to the city"" of Idlib, ""which witnessed terrorist acts by armed gangs."" Al-Assad's regime routinely insists ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the bloodshed in Syria. But the continuing carnage and a scathing report about torture at the hands of the regime suggest there's been no progress in Syria after almost a year of attacks on civilians. In Idlib, the Free Syrian Army, a group of fighters composed primarily of defectors from government forces, had fled the city for ""tactical reasons,"" said Hamza abu al-Hassan, an activist with the opposition Binnish Coordination Committee. Binnish is a town located a few kilometers northeast of Idlib. Clashes had slowed compared with previous days, but shelling continued, he said. Shelling was ongoing on the southwest outskirts of Binnish, al-Hassan said. The shells appeared to have been launched from military barracks south of the town, he said. No casualties resulted, as the shells struck open areas in an apparent attempt to scare residents. Most women and children have fled Binnish, he said. The city has shortages of food and gasoline, as well as medicine, he said. Human Rights Watch, citing accounts from witnesses and activists, said Syria's bombardment of the city of Idlib had killed 114 civilians since March 10. ""Five witnesses, including three foreign correspondents, gave separate accounts to Human Rights Watch that government forces used large-caliber machine guns, tanks, and mortars to fire indiscriminately at buildings and people in the street,"" the group said. ""After they entered Idlib, government forces detained people in house-to-house searches, looted buildings, and burned down houses, the witnesses said."" Government forces also used mortars during the attack on the city, an Idlib resident told Human Rights Watch. Government forces looted shops and apartments and burned down houses of suspected activists, the witnesses said. Throngs of security forces Wednesday infiltrated villages in the port city of Latakia, searching for activists and setting homes afire amid sporadic gunfire, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, or LCC, an opposition activist network. ""This comes under a complete cutoff (of) electricity and telecommunications in the area,"" the LCC said. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the conflict, including many women and children, the president of the U.N. General Assembly said this week. Opposition activists have put the toll at more than 9,000. Two Turkish journalists are missing in Syria, according to Milat newspaper. Adem Ozkose, a columnist and war reporter for Milat and the Middle East correspondent for Gercek Hayat magazine, and Hamit Coskun, a freelance cameraman, were covering events in Syria and shooting a documentary, according to Milat. They were last heard from Saturday, said Turgut Alp Boyraz, a member of the newspaper's foreign editorial board. Three members of the opposition Syrian National Council resigned Tuesday over disagreements with its leadership, Ausama Monajed, adviser to council head Burhan Ghalioun, said Wednesday. The three -- Haitham al-Maleh, Kamal al-Labwani and Catherine al-Telli -- ""wanted radical change within the organization,"" Monajed said. However, the council -- an umbrella organization that represents the Syrian opposition abroad -- is not ready for radical change, he said. The three decided they would be more ""effective working from the outside,"" he said. Also, Saudi Arabia and Italy on Wednesday became the latest countries to suspend embassy activities in Damascus and withdraw their staffs. Spain suspended its embassy activities earlier this month, and the United States and France previously closed their embassies. ""We reiterate the firmest condemnation of the unacceptable violence perpetrated by the Syrian regime against its citizens,"" Italy's foreign office said in a statement. ""Italy will continue to support the Syrian people and to work toward a peaceful solution to the crisis that ensures their fundamental rights and legitimate democratic aspirations."" However, Venezuela's parliament on Tuesday passed ""an agreement in solidarity with Syria in light of the imperial threat presented by the United States and its Arab allies,"" Venezuela's Interior Ministry said Wednesday in a statement. ""The document exhorts the international community and peace lovers to undertake a massive campaign to reject intervention in that nation,"" the statement continued. According to an Amnesty International report released Wednesday, Syrians detained by the regime are subjected to torture, including electric shocks, beatings and sexual violence. Based on interviews with dozens of Syrians who have fled to Jordan, the report details ""31 methods of torture or other ill treatment"" by security forces, the Syrian army and pro-government armed gangs. An 18-year-old identified as Karim told researchers his interrogators used pincers to gouge flesh from his legs while he was held for 25 days in Daraa in December. Detainees also were forced to witness abuse and hear others -- sometimes relatives or friends -- being tortured and raped, the report said. ""I heard the screams of those being tortured for 24 hours a day,"" a 29-year-old identified as Musleh told researchers. ""While in the cell, we were busy praying for the safety of those who are being tortured."" After reports this week of a massacre in Homs, where dozens of women and children were reportedly stabbed and burned to death, authorities ""arrested a number of terrorists who perpetrated the terrifying massacre against the citizens of Karm al Zaitoun neighborhood,"" the news agency reported Wednesday. Both opposition groups and the government reported a massacre in Homs, but opposition activists accused regime forces of carrying out the attacks. Shelling continued Wednesday for a fifth consecutive day on Homs neighborhoods, killing five people and wounding almost 60, activists said. More than 70 rockets and tank shells hit central and eastern neighborhoods in the city; power blackouts were reported in some areas, the activists said. Over the past year, about 30,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring countries, said Panos Moumtzis, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' coordinator for Syrian refugees. CNN's Kareem Khadder, Amir Ahmed, Mitra Mobasherat, Catherine Shoichet and Anna Ozbek contributed to this report.","Wednesday's death toll is at 56, including 29 in Idlib .

"(CNN) -- Marine Le Pen officially entered the French election race on Tuesday, saying she had secured the backing of 500 elected officials required to stand in the French presidential contest. Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front party may share some of her famous father's politics, but that is where the similarity ends. While Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the National Front and led the party from 1972 until last year, was full of bombast and fury, his 43-year-old daughter measures her words - especially on the sensitive issue of immigration -- and knows the value of a smile. The former lawyer and her supporters believe these qualities can propel her into at least a second place finish in the first round of the French presidential elections on April 22 -- despite opinion polls indicating otherwise. And while the party's presidential candidate may be more telegenic than her father, Le Pen herself believes the National Front's appeal has widened too because voters are different. ""I think the structure of our electorate has changed,"" she said. ""The perception that right-wing voters have of me is extremely different today from the perception voters of the right had of Jean-Marie Le Pen."" In fact Le Pen, a twice-divorced mother-of-three, says her voters these days often come from both the political right and left, although this claim is not borne out by public opinion polls. It is true though that her political program does cut across party lines, especially her arguments against both illegal and legal immigration, and the political integration of Europe and the euro. ""Our political leaders have a fascination for the United States and they want absolutely to create a United States of Europe,"" she said. ""We have seen the result: Europe has never been so weak economically as today. Our leaders' craziness for the euro creates a risk for the entire world."" Le Pen goes into the election with anti-euro, protectionist policies for France, and opposes the privatization of the country's post office, which she says will hit rural areas hard. She has also worked to remove extremist elements from her party. But her critics -- and there are many -- say Le Pen remains a risk. When she is away from her supporters and out in the public she often gets booed -- and worse. She was doused with water when she visited the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, a French overseas territory whose citizens come from a racially mixed background where many view the extreme right as the real threat. One protester in Reunion said: ""As a country of human rights France cannot accept this kind of person who takes advantage of the economic crisis to spread a message of Islamophobia and xenophobia."" So far, Le Pen has not faced the same accusations of racism that her father faced during his time as National Front leader, and she shrugs off this criticism: ""I have lots of experiences with this sort of thing ... they bark but they don't bite."" She has personal experience with political opponents who deploy more than words though. When she was eight years old a bomb intended for her father exploded near her family's apartment, but she, her two sisters and her parents escaped unharmed. Le Pen overcame a major hurdle by securing the required backing of the 500 elected officials required to be a candidate in the presidential race. Some analysts had speculated she would fail to obtain the necessary signatories because many would be loathe to be associated with the far right. Now Le Pen, and her political views, may prove a real wild card in the election, perhaps even threatening one of the two top contenders, conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Party rival Francois Hollande. This would mirror the most notable achievement of her father, who shocked France in 2002 by coming in second, ahead of socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in the first round of voting in the presidential election.","Marine Le Pen says she has backing of 500 elected officials needed to stand in French election .

"New York (CNN) -- The Detroit City Council passed a financial consent agreement Wednesday evening with a 5-4 vote, which grants the city the power to void contracts and slash costs but not provide state funding or loans to bail the city out of its financial problems. City and state officials avoided a Thursday deadline to save the city from the threat of looming financial insolvency or a takeover of city government by Michigan. The consent agreement was backed by Mayor Dave Bing and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. The deputy mayor of Detroit, Kirk Lewis, signed off on the consent agreement on behalf of Bing, who is recuperating from a hospital stay. Snyder issued a statement shortly after the vote and commended the council for acting ""responsibly,"" but said there is still work to be done. ""The magnitude of the city's financial challenges means that many difficult decisions lie ahead,"" the governor said. ""We must build on this spirit of cooperation and be willing to act in the city's long-term interests."" The review team voted to accept the agreement before the city council met. Fierce opposition from unions -- in a city that remains a bastion of labor power -- threatened to stymie efforts to pass the rescue package. If the city council did not agree on the deal, Snyder could have, by law, appointed an ""emergency manager"" who would have assumed the powers of the mayor and council to run day-to-day operations. The city council was under pressure from the public and city unions to reject the deal with the state. At the same time, it would lose its powers if Snyder went ahead and named an emergency manager. The only action it has taken this week to deal with the crisis was to double the city's corporate income tax to 2%. Years of decline in population and businesses and a shrinking of the tax base have pushed Detroit into a deep financial hole despite a recent resurgence in the U.S. auto industry. Without more cost cutting, the city won't be able to pay its bills come June. An estimate in January, the most recent available, was that the city would be down to $20.9 million in the bank by the end of this week. An emergency manager would have had the authority to void contracts with unions and vendors. He or she could also sell off various city assets, from the water department to valuable art in the city's museum. As the debates, negotiations and lawsuits raged this week, they did so without Bing, who was recently released from the hospital after serious intestinal surgery and won't return to work for two weeks. Both Bing and Snyder said they want to avoid a state takeover, which in itself could be the first step toward the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history. While Detroit continues to struggle financially, the U.S. automakers based in or near the city have enjoyed a financial resurgence. General Motors reported a record profit in 2011. And a pick up in auto sales and hiring has led to a nearly two-point drop in Michigan's unemployment rate over the last 12 months, the biggest improvement of any state. CNN's Jordana Ossad contributed to this report.","City faces insolvency; vote prevents Michigan state takeover .

"(CNN) -- The chief executive of Formula One team Sauber has backed recent calls for a budget cap saying that it would make the sport ""more interesting."" ""In my view, the future should indeed lie in some kind of budget cap under which each and every team could do what they want to, because we all have different strengths,"" Monisha Kaltenborn, CEO of the Swiss-based team, said in an interview with Formula1.com. ""How much longer will it take for the big teams to understand that the smaller teams are just as important to Formula One as the four big ones?"" Prior to the season opener in Australia last month, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone told the sport's elite teams to cut their spending, while suggesting a mandatory budget cap could be introduced. ""The teams have to learn to be competitive without tons of money. They have to refocus again on the basics -- on racing, spending on the sport -- and not on baronial motor homes and all kinds of entertainment,"" Ecclestone told Formula1.com. The division of prize money and television revenue in F1 is dictated by the Concorde Agreement, a contract between the sport's governing body, the FIA, the rights holders and the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) which is due to expire in 2013. Ecclestone is keen to explore the possibility of restricting teams' spending in the future. ""I would welcome it,"" he said. ""Yes, I think it could happen. We are in the middle of discussions ... They (the teams) want to get more money -- to be able to spend more!"" he said. Monisha Kaltenborn: The woman racing ahead in F1 . Kaltenborn is hoping to see a ""major step forward"" soon. ""When the current Concorde Agreement comes to an end at the end of this season, I think it would be a good time to set some kind of rules,"" she said. The Sauber team has started the 2012 season impressively with 22-year-old Mexican driver Sergio Perez claiming second place behind Ferrari's Fernando Alonso at the Malaysian Grand Prix. After what Kaltenborn described as ""painful"" second half to last season, she says the team is now settling down after the departure of manufacturer BMW at the end of 2009. ""I certainly hope we can keep up this momentum! I am pretty confident that we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can maintain this level,"" she said.","Sauber team CEO calls for budget caps for Formula One teams .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Ireland's top Roman Catholic cleric, Cardinal Sean Brady, was under mounting pressure to resign Friday amid renewed allegations about his role in dealing with the sexual abuse of children by priests. A British television documentary repeated claims made in 2010 that Brady was told of attacks by pedophile priest Father Brendan Smyth in 1975 but did not inform police or the parents of the victims. The documentary also claimed that Brady, then a priest, had a greater role in the church investigation of the Smyth allegations than he has admitted. New details and documents also were produced. Responding to the BBC program, Brady repeated his defense that he had done his job by passing details of all allegations to his superiors. He told CNN that he felt ""betrayed"" when he discovered that church officials had taken no action against Smyth, who continued to abuse children for years throughout Ireland and in the United States. Smyth was eventually imprisoned and has since died. Brady has accepted that during the 1970s, he was ""part of an unhelpful culture of deference and silence in society and the church,"" but he has insisted he does not intend to resign. The Catholic Church in Ireland said Friday that a previous request from Brady for Pope Benedict XVI to send a bishop to help him with his work would be ""reactivated."" Calls continued from abuse victims and lawmakers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for Brady to step down. Abuse survivor Jon McCourt told CNN that further inquiries should be made into Brady's role. ""Many people have been prosecuted for a lot less and served years in prison,"" he said. ""At the very least, an investigation should be carried out. The law is the law, there was no immunity. He was legally obliged to inform the authorities, and not doing so has caused a lot of people a lot of pain."" One of the most senior politicians to speak out has been Ireland's deputy prime minister, Eamon Gilmore. ""It is my own personal view that anybody who did not deal with the scale of the abuse that we have seen in this case should not hold a position of authority,"" he said. Gilmore, also the country's foreign minister, last year decided to close Ireland's embassy in the Vatican, citing the need to cut costs. Brady said then he was ""profoundly disappointed."" The government and church in the mainly Catholic country have been at loggerheads in recent times after a series of state-backed investigations into sexual abuse by priests and other church figures over several decades.","NEW: An abuse survivor says Cardinal Sean Brady should face more questions .

"(CNN) -- He's an internationally recognized journalist, doctor and nonfiction author. Now, for the first time, he's dipping his scalpel into fiction writing. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon, has written a novel that's being turned into a TV pilot. Gupta and TV writer David E. Kelley (of ""Ally McBeal"" and ""Boston Legal"" fame) are the executive producers of the show, ""Chelsea General."" TNT, a division of CNN's parent company Time Warner, ordered the pilot. Based on the book ""Monday Mornings,"" the show follows five doctors at a fictional hospital called Chelsea General as they face the realities of having made mistakes. On Tuesday, the book releases to the public. Here's the first chapter. Gupta had been thinking about writing this book for more than a decade. He wanted to incorporate an aspect of hospital life that many patients don't know about: the morbidity and mortality (M&M) meetings, where doctors gather to talk openly about the mistakes they've made. I recently chatted with Gupta about the book. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: Was there a message you wanted to get across with this book? Gupta: In fiction books, there isn't a particular agenda. What I will say, though, is that there has been an erosion of the patient-physician relationship over the past couple of decades. There's been an increasing lack of trust. Doctors and the whole health care structures are seeing so many patients on any given day, there's so little interaction. I think that the idea that you'd actually know who your doctors are, that you'd know who the people are that you're essentially trusting with your life or the life of a loved one, it seems like that would be a no-brainer. But the reality is, people know more about their school systems, and where their grocery store is, than they do their hospitals and their doctors. I don't think there's a message here, except it's going to provide an insight into the people and the hospitals that, when you need them, become the most important thing in your life. And there's a chance to see what I've seen over the last 20 years about how some of that works. CNN: Why did you decide to write this as a work of fiction? Gupta: This is a hard book to write as a nonfiction. You are dealing with some sensitive, touchy subjects within medicine. You have to be sensitive to the people who live and breathe in that world and will continue to do so long after this book comes out. It's fiction based on real things. CNN: How did the process compare with writing your nonfiction books? Gupta: Nonfiction is more difficult. I think especially with medical nonfiction, you spend so much of your time sourcing material. While I had narratives and stories that would sort of make the points in ""Chasing Life"" or ""Cheating Death,"" the creative part of it was superseded by essentially trying to write a term paper in terms of how you source things. You really spend a lot of time just doing research. With this: it's harder to organize. It was challenging at the beginning to forecast the narrative, the beginning, middle and end. Once I had that down, I enjoyed the writing of it, once the beginning organizational part was done. CNN: What's the difference between M&M meetings and other ways that mistakes get addressed? Gupta: There's a whole system that exists in our society if a mistake is made and a patient has been harmed. There's a system within hospital itself. But this isn't about that. This is about the doctors really holding each other accountable. So this is saying: 'We can do better. Those types of mistakes aren't made in this hospital. Here's how we allow them to never happen again.' It's not to say that it's fuzzy edges and soft lines. These meetings can be vicious, in some ways, far worse than what the punitive systems that exist have to offer. Getting sued or being disciplined by the administration may pale in comparison to being held accountable by your colleagues, the people whom you respect and helped train you and all that sort of stuff. Yes, certainly there's an accountability that exists in our society. But this is about a secretive meeting that takes place in hospitals with a different purpose. The purpose is to advance medicine and advance science. As awkward and unsettling as it may be, a lot of those advances are sometimes made because of mistakes, and the worst possible thing is that nobody learns from the mistakes. CNN: Tell us about some of the characters in ""Monday Mornings."" Gupta: There's five main characters. These characters are all composites of people I've known in my own life. They all work at the same hospital, but not necessarily the same department. One of my main characters is Tyler Wilson -- this is a guy who is a neurosurgeon in a hospital. His brother died of brain tumor when he was young. His sister was shot in a convenience store robbery and is in a vegetative state. The thing he remembers beyond the tragedy of losing his sibling is how the doctors, when his brother died, did not come out and tell his family. They sent a social worker to go do it. It was devastating. As often happens in the case of couples that lose a child, his parents got divorced. That was his upbringing. So he had two goals in life when he realized he could become a doctor: 1) He wanted to become better neurosurgeon than the one that took care of his brother, and 2) He also wanted to make it so that, under his watch, a family would never get treated the way his family was when they lost one of their children. You don't know this when you meet him. He's a very good surgeon. He has some almost stereotypical qualities about who he is. He's not the nicest guy in the world in most situations, at least to his colleagues. When it comes to families, there's nobody better. He's the best guy in the hospital. When he makes a medical mistake, you get a sense of just what prism through which he sees that mistake. He sees it through: This is my life's calling. This is all I was supposed to do: To save people that other people could not. In this case, he didn't. CNN: How's the TV pilot going? Gupta: We'll have a pilot done hopefully by May. We're feeling very good about it. David [E. Kelley] wrote the pilot, but it's very true to the book, and I think it's going to be great. We've got great actors. The cast includes Ving Rhames (""Pulp Fiction""), Alfred Molina (""Spider-Man 2""), Jamie Bamber (""Battlestar Galactica""), Jennifer Finnigan (""The Bold & the Beautiful""), Keong Sim (who plays Michael Chang Sr. on ""Glee"") and Sarayu Rao (""Sons of Tucson""). It's being shot in Los Angeles. CNN: Will the show's story extend beyond the plot of the book? Gupta: The show is based on the book. The theme of the book is the theme of the show as well. You probably have half a season worth of stuff in terms of storyline. We're going to be continuously creating storylines and doing things with our characters. It's the same theme, same characters, but obviously a show is going to have a lot longer life than the book itself. CNN: How do you have time for all of this? Gupta: When it comes to the TV show, I'm not a scripted drama guy. I'm not literally scouting out the shots. I helped with the casting only because the characters are my characters. Out of all the things that I do, that's not something I'm going to be spending a lot of time on. For me, it's all along the spectrum of similar things. It's all medicine and health related. I practice as a doctor, report stuff as a journalist, this was a fictional way of doing some of the same stuff. I don't see these as so disparate that your mind is just spinning all the time.","""Monday Mornings"" is a new novel by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent .

"(CNN) -- The agent who penetrated al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and returned from Yemen with the group's new ""airline bomb"" was always under Saudi control and was not a double-agent, two sources briefed by Saudi counterterrorism officials have told CNN. One source told CNN that the device was recovered around April 20, more than a week before the first anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden, and was then handed over to the United States for forensic analysis. One source said that from the very beginning, the infiltrator was working for Saudi intelligence. The other said Saudi intelligence was involved ""from A to Z."" The source added that the agent involved had moved in the ""jihadist orbit"" in Saudi Arabia before being recruited. The agent was sent to Yemen ""months and months"" ago, when Saudi sources in Yemen reported indications that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, might be again preparing a plot against U.S. aviation, one source said. These were the first indications ""that al Qaeda might be trying again,"" according to one source, after the Christmas Day 2009 underwear bomb plot and the laser-printer bombs dispatched from Yemen in October 2010. The whole operation was personally overseen by Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the head of Saudi counterterrorism, one source said. Initial reports had not revealed the extent of Saudi involvement. At one point, the Saudi agent reported that a device was being built, and the Saudis then informed the United States, according to one of the latest sources, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the information. The agent then received training on the device from AQAP instructors. According to one source the device contained PETN explosive, the same explosive used in previous attacks by AQAP's master bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asiri. Describing the bomb, one source said it was smaller than previous bombs made by al-Asiri. The other said it contained an amount of explosive similar to that hidden inside laser printers that were sent from Yemen in October 2010 . The printer devices contained 300 to 400 grams of explosive and had a larger amount of high explosive than carried in the Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. One source told CNN the device was designed to be worn in clothing. There has been no confirmation from other sources of that detail. The source said the device was ""more advanced"" than the underwear device, as al-Asiri was trying to rectify past mistakes. The device in 2009 failed to detonate, apparently because the detonation charge failed to set off the PETN explosives. The source added that AQAP bomb-makers apparently believed that in the case of the Christmas Day plot they had got the initiator mechanism wrong, and that the mistake in that case was to mix acids slowly in an effort to begin the detonation. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters Tuesday that the device is ""similar to the underwear bomber of 2009, but an evolution to that."" Saudi intelligence had hoped that their agent would be able to get information about al-Asiri's whereabouts, but the agent did not meet al-Asiri, one source said. One source cautioned: ""Even if al-Asiri is eventually killed, we should not celebrate, because he has trained many people."" It is still unclear how the device left Yemen. One Arab source familiar with the investigation said he assumed it had been carried on a plane, which would raise troubling questions about airport security in the capital, Sanaa. But another hinted that it had been carried overland, in the possession of the Saudi mole. One source said Saudi counterterrorism officials were upset that details of the operation had emerged in the United States because they had a network of agents inside AQAP who could be compromised by leaks from Washington. The sources also questioned suggestions that the infiltrator's information led to the successful drone strike over the weekend that targeted Fahd al-Quso, a leading figure in AQAP. The Saudi agent did not meet al-Quso while in Yemen, according to one source. The sources said AQAP has better resources than previously and is using the safe haven created in southern Yemen to good effect. The group has developed laboratories and is extending training in chemistry and bomb-making, he said. ""At the moment they can operate in relative freedom,"" the source said. The Saudi concern over the leak of information about the mole infiltrating AQAP was echoed by the chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee. ""It's really, to me, unfortunate that this has gotten out, because this could really interfere with operations overseas,"" Rep. Peter King of New York told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. ""My understanding is a major investigation is going to be launched because of this."" A senior administration official told CNN that officials were debating whether to release photographs of the device to law enforcement agencies. On one side of the argument, Transportation Safety Administration screeners and law enforcement might more easily identify any similar devices made as part of the same plot, the official said. But officials were reluctant to do so out of concern that the photographs would be leaked to the news media and that the would-be bombers would learn what law enforcement knows -- and might not know -- about the bomb's workings. John Brennan, the chief White House counterterrorism adviser, who told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that officials believe redundant security systems would have prevented any airline bombing attempt from succeeding, but analysts were studying the device to see whether security procedures should be adjusted. ""We're trying to make sure that we take the measures that we need to prevent any other type of IED, similarly constructed, from getting through security procedures,"" Brennan said. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said authorities have ""no specific, credible information regarding an active terrorist plot against the U.S. at this time."" But another U.S. official told CNN, ""We are not ready to say the threat stream is over. We believe external plotting continues.""

"(CNN) -- Top-billed Julia Roberts is comprehensively miscast in ""Mirror Mirror,"" the first of the year's two big-budget, live-action ""Snow White"" movies. Even so, this pretty bauble of a picture -- which looks like it was filmed in a giant snow globe - scrapes together enough invention, exuberance and goofiness to skate over this blatant misstep, and Roberts herself is so willing to give it the old college try you wind up rooting for her regardless. She plays the evil Queen, Snow White's murderous stepmother -- a role that calls for cold-blooded malice, arrogance, cunning and class, qualities conspicuously lacking in this warm, earthy, intuitive actress, and who settles for a snooty (but inconsistent) English accent as the next best thing. Still, good for Julia for having some fun at the expense of midlife vanity. As we all know, the Queen is hung up on what her mirror tells her about getting old -- she can't bear being eclipsed in the beauty stakes by her stepdaughter Snow (Lily Collins, Phil's daughter). In one of the movie's funniest jibes, she submits to an excruciating beauty treatment involving bird poop, snails and scorpion stings (a fairytale botox) to give her that extra edge -- a regimen that's probably only a slight exaggeration on what Hollywood royalty routinely puts up with to keep in front of the cameras past a certain age. Roberts, 44, has never been that kind of glamour-puss. It's her personality that makes her so attractive, so she can afford to smile. And she cuts quite a figure in the outrageously decadent dresses, designed for her by Eiko Ishioka. The Japanese stylist, who died in January, is best known in the West for her costumes for Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" as well as pop stars Bjork and Grace Jones, and the opening ceremony at the Beijing Olympics. Ishioka's aggressively sumptuous, sometimes surrealistic, creations have also been a staple in all three of Tarsem Singh's previous films: ""The Cell,"" ""The Fall"" and, recently, ""Immortals."" Her contribution to ""Mirror Mirror"" is so pronounced, it's only fitting the film is dedicated to her. Roberts' gowns include a vermilion peacock creation so ornate it requires its own tax levy on the hard-pressed peasantry -- but Ishioka's genius is equally well displayed in the perfectly chosen headwear that goes a long way to distinguishing the personalities of the film's seven dwarfs. These pugnacious rogues (Napoleon, Wolf, Grub, Butcher and Grimm are some of their names) are a very different crew from Disney's loveable gold-diggers, but they're Singh's best defense against a wobbly, hit-and-miss script. Woodland bandits, they dress up as bandy-legged giants (Ishioka provides them with stilts that seem to be made of accordion sleeves) to set upon unwary travelers, like Armie Hammer's Prince Alcott. In due course, they take in the exiled Snow -- in return for housecleaning and cooking services -- and teach her how to stand on her own two feet. Collins is charming as the innocent princess, the poison apple in her stepmother's eye, but the film's real surprise is the tongue-in-cheek tone, a lightness that stands in sharp relief to the turgid breast-beating this filmmaker went in for in ""Immortals."" It's been a while since Nathan Lane got this much screen time to camp it up, as the Queen's butler, Brighton (even if he does spend some of it in the form of cockroach), and Hammer's a hoot as the arrogant -- but oh-so-eligible -- prince. ""Mirror Mirror"" may not add up to the sum of its better parts -- and it's a curious time of year to release it -- but there should be an audience for a frivolous family film with this many frills and ruffles.","In ""Mirror Mirror,"" Julia Roberts plays the evil queen, Snow White's murderous stepmother .

"(CNN) -- It's not often that the White House holds a news conference late on a Sunday night. Especially an unscheduled one. So when it was announced, around 9:45 p.m. ET on May 1, that President Obama would be addressing the nation within the hour, you knew it had to be important. Had there been a major development in Libya? Things had been heating up since NATO started intervening against Moammar Gadhafi's forces. Were U.S. troops going into another part of the Arab world? Had there been another terrorist attack? Or was it the news that many Americans had been waiting on for nearly a decade: that Osama bin Laden, leader of al Qaeda, had finally been brought to justice for the tragic events of September 11? The White House announcement provided no details, so it was up to everyone else to fill in the blank. Speculation was rampant, especially online and on social media. What was so important that it couldn't wait until morning? By the time Obama finally spoke at 11:30 p.m., the world already knew the news: ""The United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children."" The president never had a chance to avoid the mother of all spoilers -- not with how fast news travels today. An hour before his speech, the cat was out of the bag, thanks to Keith Urbahn, chief of staff for former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. ""So I'm told by a reputable person they have killed Osama Bin Laden. Hot damn,"" Urbahn tweeted. It didn't take long after that for major news organizations to confirm that the news was indeed true: the most-wanted terrorist in the world was dead, eight years to the day after President Bush delivered his ""Mission Accomplished"" speech. ""It was an incredibly symbolic event,"" said William Keylor, a professor of history and international relations at Boston University. ""It was closure to 9/11. ... Al Qaeda had been pretty much degraded, but (bin Laden) was still on the run."" As confirmation quickly spread of bin Laden's death, emotional celebrations began taking place across the country. Many were caught on camera. People in the nation's capital flocked to the White House, carrying American flags, singing the national anthem and cheering the news in front of television cameras. At a baseball game in Philadelphia, fans of both teams stopped to chant ""U-S-A, U-S-A!"" Celebrations also were held at New York's ground zero, the site of the former World Trade Center. ""I never thought this night would come, where we would actually capture or kill bin Laden. And, thank the Lord, he's been eliminated, to put it politely,"" said Bob Gibson, a retired New York City police officer. ""A lot of us ... gave up. But it did come, and a lot of us are overjoyed that it happened."" 'The most intense 38 minutes of my life' By the next morning, the national conversation had started to change. The emotional impact of the announcement was subsiding, and the public wanted more detail, more explanation. How did the United States find bin Laden? Why was he killed and not captured? Who exactly killed him? It was soon learned that an elite team of Navy SEALs had flown two helicopters into Abbottabad, Pakistan, where bin Laden was living in a three-story compound with approximately two dozen people, including his relatives and one of his most trusted couriers. The United States had been tracking the courier for years, and the CIA informed the president in September 2010 that bin Laden might be living at the compound, a $1 million home surrounded by large privacy walls topped with barbed wire. On April 29, 2011, after several meetings with his National Security Council, Obama authorized an attack on the compound. In an operation that lasted nearly 40 minutes, the SEALs breached the compound's walls and methodically went through the house, floor by floor. Bin Laden and his wife were found on the third floor, White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a news conference. Carney said a SEAL fatally shot bin Laden when bin Laden made a threatening move. An iconic photo, released by the White House, shows Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and other officials in the White House Situation Room, following developments as the raid went down. Clinton later called it ""the most intense 38 minutes of my life."" Today, there have already been several books written about the raid, and a movie is said to be in the works. ""I think the fact that it was such a tremendous success was the reason that the administration decided to publicize it: 'We're going to put out all the facts and let the chips fall where they may,' "" Keylor said. ""And, of course, the downside of that was that it really antagonized the Pakistanis."" The United States and Pakistan had been working together for years trying to track down bin Laden and fight extremists near the Afghanistan border. But the United States, fearing that a leak could jeopardize its mission and tip off bin Laden, kept its raid a complete secret from Pakistan. The Pakistanis were outraged and humiliated by the blatant violation of their national sovereignty. U.S. officials questioned their ally's motivations, as bin Laden was ""hiding in plain sight."" The CIA director at the time, Leon Panetta, told U.S. lawmakers in a closed-door session that Pakistani officials were either ""involved or incompetent,"" adding that ""neither is a good place to be."" Photo debate continues . From the raid, U.S. forces retrieved 10 hard drives, five computers and more than 100 storage devices containing intelligence from bin Laden's compound, according to a senior U.S. official. They also found some homemade videos, including one that shows a graying bin Laden, wrapped in a blanket, watching himself on a small television. ""The fact that they killed (bin Laden) was significant, but they also demythologized him,"" said Thomas Mockaitis, author of ""Osama bin Laden: A Biography."" ""They revealed him to be a megalomaniac, in many ways kind of a petty individual. Instead of this kind of great, powerful figure ... he looks like a bit of a narcissist. I think that, in some ways, was as important as actually killing him. It brought him down quite a bit it terms of his stature."" But perhaps the most talked about pieces of evidence from last year's raid have yet to see the light of day: photos of a dead bin Laden. The administration decided to keep the photos classified, saying the graphic nature of the images would only incite further violence or be used for propaganda purposes. ""We don't trot this stuff out as trophies,"" Obama told CBS News. ""We don't need to spike the football."" However, many Americans, including prominent lawmakers, believe they have a right to see the images. And some people have another concern: How do they know bin Laden is dead if they can't see proof? That isn't a concern of Sen. John McCain, one of several U.S. Congress members allowed to view the photos. The Arizona Republican, Obama's opponent in the 2008 presidential election, said there was no doubt that bin Laden is dead. But the debate over the photos continues one year later. On Friday, a federal judge turned down a request for release of the photos, saying there were legitimate national security interests to deny disclosure. The war on terror also continues. Bin Laden's death might have underlined the weakened state of al Qaeda, but affiliate groups, including the Taliban, al-Shabaab and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, ""remain committed to the group's ideology,"" said a U.S. intelligence report released in January. ""Lone wolf"" terrorists are a threat as well, as we've seen recently in Norway and France. More: Is the core of al Qaeda on its last legs? The threats, however, should be no surprise to Obama, who warned that there was still work to be done when he announced bin Laden's death a year ago. Bin Laden's death ""does not mark the end of our effort,"" he said in his speech. ""There's no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. ""We must -- and we will -- remain vigilant at home and abroad.""","It has been one year since Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan .
The news of bin Laden's death spread like wildfire online and on social media .

"(CNN) -- A late strike from Samir Nasri, set up by the returning Carlos Tevez, helped Manchester City maintain their quest for a first English league title in 44 years with a 2-1 win over Chelsea on Wednesday. The France international collected a clever reverse pass from Tevez, making his first appearance in five months after falling out with manager Roberto Mancini, to score an 86th-minute winner. City had trailed to Gary Cahill's deflected strike until Sergio Aguero leveled the match from the penalty spot with 12 minutes remaining. The victory maintains City's 100% record in home league matches this season and draws them within a point of Premier League leaders and bitter rivals Manchester United. The buildup to the match was dominated by the return of Tevez, who hadn't featured for City since refusing to warm up during a Champions League clash with Bayern Munich back in September. He took his place on the bench to a mixture of boos and applause, and he was called upon in the 66th minute after Cahill had pounced on a loose ball in the area to fire a shot into the net via an inadvertent flick from Yaya Toure. But when Pablo Zabaleta's shot hit the arm of Chelsea substitute Michael Essien, City were handed a lifeline and Argentina striker Aguero slotted home the spot kick. Then Tevez played a cute one-two with Nasri, and the midfielder dinked the ball over Chelsea keeper Petr Cech to secure a vital win. On a dramatic night in England's top flight, Tottenham surrendered third place to Arsenal after being held 1-1 at home by Stoke. Taking to the field for the first time since Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal clash with Bolton was abandoned due to Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest, Tottenham's poor form continued. The London side had to rely on an injury-time goal from Netherlands international Rafael Van der Vaart to salvage a draw after striker Cameron Jerome had put City in front. Arsenal leapfrogged their north London rivals with a 1-0 win at Everton, as defender Thomas Vermaelen's eighth-minute goal put the Gunners a point clear. Chelsea stayed fifth, losing ground on both Tottenham and Arsenal in the race to finish in the fourth and final European Champions League qualification spot. Liverpool's hopes of finishing fourth are all but over after squandering a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers. Uruguay international Sebastian Coates put Liverpool ahead with a superb volley early on before Dirk Kuyt made it 2-0 on 72 minutes. But Rangers hit back with three goals in the last 14 minutes, from Shaun Derry, former Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie. The result kept Liverpool seven points behind Chelsea, while QPR moved out of the relegation zone, moving one point clear of Bolton.","Samir Nasri's late goal helps Manchester City to a dramatic 2-1 win over Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to have many different roles and responsibilities, serving as an international humanitarian ambassador, television host, model, actress and businesswoman. But the role that's most fulfilling -- and the one that is most important to me -- is ""Mom."" First and foremost, as a parent, I welcomed the announcement that 92 mayors from across the United States have signed a letter supporting the Environmental Protection Agency's safeguards against mercury. This is a brilliant testimony to the mayors' understanding of the fundamental need for clean healthy air and water. Although I do my best to be sure my two sons grow up healthy, strong, independent and responsible, I cannot control what is in the air they breathe. Right now, millions of kids across this country breathe in pollution pumped into the air by coal-fired power plants. This can impair a child's development and cause asthma attacks, the No. 1 reason kids miss school. These plants are also the largest source of mercury, a potent brain poison that is linked to severe learning disabilities, developmental problems, and lower IQs. In 2010, power plants emitted 66,050 pounds of toxin into the air. Mercury from coal-fired power plants rains down into our rivers, streams and oceans, where it can contaminate the fish we eat. Exposure to mercury is especially dangerous for pregnant women and young children. Because fish is a dietary staple for my family, this is a huge personal concern, but every family deserves the right to eat safe, healthy fish without worrying about toxic mercury. The good news is that last year, the Obama administration set historic mercury and air toxics standards to curb mercury pollution from new coal-fired power plants. These safeguards will cut mercury pollution from power plants by more than 90% and dramatically reduce our kids' exposure to mercury, as well as cancer-causing substances such as arsenic and chromium. Unacceptably, however, these landmark protections are under attack in Congress. On Wednesday, the Senate will vote on whether to overturn the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. This shortsighted legislation goes so far that it would prevent the EPA from ever acting on this issue again. It has taken decades to finally get clean-air protections from mercury in place. We can't let Congress overturn them. By cleaning up or retiring coal plants and transitioning to clean, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, we can protect our economy, create jobs and attain cleaner air for our families. Clean energy solutions are ready to go, and we have only just begun tapping their potential. In Germany, 10% of all electricity last month was supplied by solar power, and Germany gets about the same amount of sunshine as Alaska . While here in the U.S., more than 20% of the energy being generated in the states of Iowa and South Dakota is already from wind. With the price of clean energy technologies coming down dramatically, this is the wrong time for our government to backtrack. As a recognizable face and voice, I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to advocate for the health of women and children around the world, from Ukraine to Ghana. The United States is the last place I'd expect to see politicians roll back public-health protections that are already in place. That's why I'm working with the Sierra Club to raise awareness and encourage people to take action by contacting their senators and asking them to support keeping the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards intact. Congress has the opportunity to be a part of the solution. It can protect our children's health and our air and water. There's no more important job than that. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Elle Macpherson.","Elle Macpherson: Coal-fired power plants largest source of mercury pollution, a brain poison .

"Paris (CNN) -- Al Jazeera will not broadcast video it received showing killings in France blamed on Mohammed Merah, it announced Tuesday, saying the material ""does not meet our Code of Ethics."" The network is ""also declining all requests for copies,"" it said on Twitter. The decision came after Al Jazeera's Paris bureau chief said the network received video of the shootings in the mail. The edited footage contains images of the killings of seven people, along with music, religious singing and readings from the Quran, bureau chief Zied Tarrouche said Tuesday. ""You can hear the gunshots at the time of the killings. ... You can hear the cries of the victims,"" he said on CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Al Jazeera gave the material to the police, he said. Before the network's decision not to broadcast it, French President Nicolas Sarkozy asked television stations not to show the footage ""out of respect for the victims and out of respect for the republic."" ""I ask the heads of all television channels that have these images in their possession not to distribute them under any circumstances,"" the French leader said. Merah, the suspect in the shootings, was killed Thursday at the end of a 32-hour siege at the apartment in the city of Toulouse where he was holed up. He was wanted for the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three children ages 4, 5, and 7. Two other people were seriously wounded in shootings blamed on him. The video arrived by mail Monday on a USB stick along with an unsigned letter claiming al Qaeda was responsible for the attacks, Tarrouche told CNN. The memory stick contained two clips with a total of 25 minutes of material, Tarrouche told CNN. Al Jazeera kept a copy when police took the original, he said. The video of the shootings on March 11, 15 and 19 was apparently recorded by a camera around the gunman's neck, Tarrouche said. Police said earlier they believed Merah had filmed the killings and that they had recovered video after he was killed. Separately, the Israeli government confirmed Tuesday that Merah had visited Israel and the West Bank for three days in September 2010, but did not offer details about what he did there. He crossed from Jordan via the Allenby Bridge, where he underwent procedural questioning by Israel's internal security service, the Shin Bet, and was allowed to enter, government spokesman Mark Regev said. On Sunday, police charged Merah's brother, Abdelkader, with complicity in seven murders and two attempted murders and took him into custody, the Paris prosecutor's office said. Authorities also charged the brother with conspiracy to prepare acts of terrorism and group theft, the prosecutor's office said. Abdelkader Merah feels he is being made a scapegoat for the crimes his brother is accused of, his lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens said. He feels Mohammed Merah's acts were ""reprehensible,"" Laguens said on BFM-TV, adding: ""The impression we are getting today is that because we weren't able to put his brother on trial because he is no longer with us, then maybe we are coming down on the only person that is present."" Police also questioned Mohammed Merah's mother and his brother's girlfriend, but have released them without charge, the Paris prosecutor said. Questions have been raised as to why Merah -- a petty criminal who was placed under surveillance by French authorities after visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan -- was not being more closely watched. He claimed to have attended an al Qaeda training camp, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, and was on the U.S. no-fly list for that reason, a U.S. intelligence official said. Prime Minister Francois Fillon told French radio station RTL that ""there was no single element"" that would have allowed the police to arrest Merah before the killings began. He was tracked down by police 10 days after the first shooting on March 11. In that attack, Imad Ibn Ziaten, a paratrooper of North African origin, arranged to meet a man in Toulouse who said he wanted to buy a scooter Ziaten had advertised online, the interior minister said. The victim said in the ad that he was in the military. Four days later, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse. In the third attack, at the private Jewish school Ozar Hatorah on March 19, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up and shot a teacher and three children -- two of them the teacher's young sons -- in the head. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father. Police said the same guns were used in all three attacks.

"(CNN) -- The past year has seen the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan plummet. In the first three months of 2012, there were 11, compared with 21 in the first three months of 2011 and a record 28 in the first quarter of 2010. On Monday, Pakistan's parliament started to debate whether the United States should be made to stop CIA drone strikes altogether in the Pakistani border regions with Afghanistan and also whether the U.S. should apologize for NATO airstrikes that killed some two dozen Pakistani soldiers late last year. Given the high level of hostility to the United States in Pakistan, the results of the parliamentary debate are pretty much a foregone conclusion. The parliament will almost certainly vote against the allowing the continuation of the drone strikes and will also demand an American apology for the deaths of its soldiers. Obama calls for balanced approach on U.S.-Pakistan relations . The debate in parliament comes as relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have reached a nadir, caused by a wave of incidents over the past year that have poisoned the two countries' already often troubled relationship: . -- The killing of two Pakistanis by a CIA contractor in January 2011. -- The unilateral U.S. attack on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad four months later. -- The airstrikes by NATO in November that killed the Pakistani soldiers. That incident caused Pakistan to close its borders to trucks resupplying NATO soldiers in Afghanistan. At 2 a.m. November 26, two Pakistani border posts about half a kilometer from the Afghan border came under heavy fire from NATO helicopters that had strayed across the border into Pakistani airspace. Pakistani officials immediately termed the attack, which killed 26 Pakistani soldiers, a ""deliberate act of aggression,"" while U.S. officials maintained that the Pakistani security officials had fired on the helicopters first. Either way, the friendly fire incident was devastating, not least to the U.S. drone program in Pakistan's tribal regions, which was subsequently suspended for almost seven weeks, one of the longest pauses in the strikes since the program started in 2004. Pakistan also ordered the United States to vacate Shamsi Air Base in Balochistan, from which many of the CIA drones were launched. For many months before this incident, the United States' aggressive drone campaign in Pakistan had been slowing. There were 70 drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal regions in 2011, down from 118 in 2010, which saw the peak number of strikes since the program began. The drop in drone strikes during 2011 was because a series of events that wore on the ever-fragile U.S.-Pakistan relationship. On January 27, 2011, an American citizen, Raymond Davis, shot and killed two Pakistanis who he said were attempting to rob him in the streets of Lahore. Despite U.S. claims of diplomatic immunity because of Davis' employment at the U.S. consulate in Lahore, he landed in jail, charged with a double murder and illegal weapons possession. Much of the Pakistani public was outraged when it was revealed in February that Davis was a CIA contractor. As a result of the complex negotiations to get Davis out of Pakistani jail, there were just three CIA drone strikes in February and another nine strikes in March while U.S. officials worked to settle the issue and finally bring Davis home. The day after Davis was finally released, a strike on March 17, 2011, killed a reported 36 civilians, as well as a top Taliban commander. Pakistani officials condemned the strike, and Pakistanis took to the streets to protest them. The CIA suspended drone strikes for a month, before resuming them again on April 13. Less than a month after the drone strikes had picked up, on May 1, U.S. Navy SEALs secretly flew into Pakistani territory aboard stealth helicopters to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, who was living not far from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. Pakistan's powerful military establishment was angry about the violation of its sovereignty, and relations between the U.S. and Pakistan sank further. For their part, many Americans were outraged that al Qaeda's leader had been living for years in a sizable city in central Pakistan. Aware of how unpopular the drone strikes were becoming in Pakistan, some top U.S. Defense and State Department officials behind the scenes were pushing for more selective drone strikes, which the CIA opposed. The White House ordered an evaluation of the drone program during the summer of 2011. The study found that the CIA was primarily killing low-level militants in its drone strikes. Those results prompted the government to implement new rules in November governing when and how specific drone strikes were authorized. The State Department was given a larger say in the decision-making process. Pakistani leaders were promised advanced notification of some strikes. The CIA pledged to refrain from conducting strikes during visits by Pakistani officials to the United States. But the new rules are unlikely to placate critics inside and outside of Pakistan, who condemn the violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and the killing of its civilians. At the New America Foundation, we maintain an up-to-date database of every reported drone strike in Pakistan's tribal regions since 2004. We monitor reports about the strikes from the top Western and Pakistani news sources, such as The New York Times, Associated Press, CNN, Reuters, Express Tribune, Dawn, Geo TV and others. According to our data, 7% of the fatalities resulting from drone strikes in 2011 were civilians, up 2 percentage points from our figure in 2010. Over the life of the CIA drone program in Pakistan from 2004 to 2012, we found that the civilian casualty rate has been 17%. Clearly, as the years have progressed, the drone strikes have become more precise and discriminating. There is still considerable debate over how the U.S. government defines a ""militant"" and how easily it is able to distinguish between militants and civilians from a drone cruising tens of thousands of feet above the ground. In March 2011, Maj. Gen. Ghayur Mehmood acknowledged that ""the number of innocent people being killed is relatively low"" and that ""most of the targets are hard-core militants,"" the first such public acknowledgment by a senior Pakistani military officer. Similarly, President Barack Obama made his first public comments about the covert drone program, when he told participants of a Google+ ""hangout"" on January 30 this year that the United States only conducts ""very precise precision strikes against al Qaeda and their affiliates, and we're very careful in terms of how it's been applied."" Even if it is the case that there are relatively few civilians killed in the strikes, the drone program is quite unpopular in Pakistan. The New America Foundation conducted one of the few public opinion polls in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas during the summer of 2010 and found that almost 90% of the respondents in the region where the drone strikes are located oppose U.S. military operations in the region. The wider Pakistani public shares this sentiment, though to a lesser degree. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in June 2011 found that about six of every 10 Pakistanis consider the drone campaign to be unnecessary. Despite the fact that the pace of drone strikes slowed considerably from 2010 to 2011, the number of strikes last year still ranked as the second-highest annual count since the drone program began. And despite its deteriorating relations with Pakistan, the United States killed a number of key al Qaeda leaders with drone strikes in 2011. Al Qaeda's top operative in Pakistan and purported conduit between the terrorist group and the Pakistani Taliban, Ilyas Kashmiri, was reported killed in a strike on June 4. Then, on August 22, a drone reportedly killed al Qaeda's top operational planner, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, dealing another heavy blow to the organization. And in September, a drone strike killed Abu Hafs al-Shihri, the man believed to be responsible for planning al Qaeda's operations in the region. The continued success of strikes against al Qaeda's top leaders led Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to declare in July that the United States was ""within reach of strategically defeating al Qaeda."" According to senior U.S. counterterrorism officials, al Qaeda's leadership bench has been so thinned by the drone campaign that there are only two real leaders of the organization left: bin Laden's successor as overall leader of the group, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Abu Yahya al-Libi. This raises an interesting question: Maybe one of the reasons that the drone campaign has eased off in the past several months is that the CIA has begun to run out of real targets?","Authors: America's drone war in Pakistan is much diminished .

"New York (CNN) -- A Canadian beauty pageant contestant who was disqualified when the Miss Universe Canada organizers discovered she was transgender said Tuesday she had been devastated by the decision and wanted a clear change in the rules. After initially disqualifying Talackova, organizers of the Miss Universe beauty pageant reversed course late Monday, saying she can participate. In a statement, the Miss Universe Organization said Jenna Talackova can compete provided ""she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada, and the standards established by other international competitions."" The statement, however, did not elaborate on what the requirements were. The 6-foot-1-inch blond model told a news conference Tuesday of the pain the row had caused her. ""I am a woman. I was devastated and I felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust,"" she said. Talackova, a 23-year-old Vancouver resident, also called on Donald Trump, who owns the Miss Universe competition, to state ""in plain words"" whether she will be able to compete and go forward to the Miss Universe final if she wins her country's contest. ""I have never asked for any special consideration. I only wanted to compete,"" she said. ""I also want Mr. Trump to clearly state that this rule will be eliminated because I do not want any other woman to suffer the discrimination that I have to endure."" Speaking to CNN Tuesday, Trump said that according to the laws of Canada and the United States, Talackova should be allowed to enter the pageant. ""So she will be entering the Miss Canada pageant, but we went strictly by the laws,"" he said. ""As with any competition, the Miss Universe pageant has rules that apply to all of its franchises around the world. Such rules include, but are not limited to, citizenship, age, and marital status requirements. Additionally, the rules currently state that all contestants must be naturally born females,"" the Miss Universe organization said. Those rules are not posted on the Miss Universe website. High profile feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, speaking alongside Talackova, also said Trump needed to clear up the confusion over Talackova's participation. ""We need a clear answer -- not a wimpy, wishy-washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank. Will Jenna be allowed to compete or not? Will he eliminate this abhorrent rule or not?"" Allred said Talackova, who until Tuesday had not spoken to reporters, was considering all legal options. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, or GLAAD, commended the pageant organizer's decision Monday night. ""The Miss Universe Organization made the right decision and has taken an important first step,"" the group said. Talackova was one of the 65 finalists selected to contend for the title of Miss Universe Canada and the honor of representing her country in the Miss Universe competition. But organizers told her last month she could not compete because she lied about having undergone sexual reassignment surgery and did not meet requirements for the pageant. At the time, the Miss Universe Organization said current rules state that all contestants must be a ""naturally born female."" In a 2010 interview in Thailand, where she was competing for Miss International Queen, a competition for transgender women, Talackova said she knew she was a girl at age 4. She said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19. After Talackova's disqualification, social media users flooded the Facebook page of Miss Universe Canada with comments criticizing the decision. A petition started on the social change website Change.org garnered more than 41,000 signatures calling for organizers to reverse their ruling. The 61st annual Miss Universe Canada Pageant will be held in Toronto on May 19. CNN's Chris Boyette and Alan Duke contributed to this report.","Organizers say Talackova can participate if she meets certain requirements .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea romped into the English FA Cup semifinal with a 5-1 beating of London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in a controversial match at Wembley Sunday. The pre-match minute's silence to mark the anniversary of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and Saturday's death of Italian footballer Piermario Morosini had to be cut short due to jeers from a section of Chelsea supporters. The Blues were forced to issue an apology on its website after the match saying they were ""extremely disappointed that a very small minority of fans embarrassed the club."" When the game -- played between two teams battling to secure England's fourth and final European Champions League place next season -- was under way the controversy continued, centering around Chelsea's second goal. Leading 1-0 from Didier Drogba's superb first-half strike, Chelsea went further ahead when Juan Mata's shot hit a cluster of bodies on the Tottenham line, with TV replays indicating it had not crossed the line. But referee Martin Atkinson awarded the goal to spark frantic protests from incensed Tottenham players. They reacted with a Gareth Bale goal, but even that had a tinge of controversy, with Atkinson ignoring goalkeeper Petr Cech's foul on striker Emmanuel Adebayor, which could have led to a red card, to play the advantage for the Welshman to score. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said Atkinson later apologized. ""I spoke to him. He says he feels worse than I do. I said: 'I don't think so,' "" Redknapp told reporters. ""He knows he's made a mistake and he says he'll have a bad week as well."" Chelsea responded with a superb third goal by Ramires before fellow midfielder Frank Lampard put the outcome beyond doubt with a long-range free-kick which wrong-footed Carlo Cudicini in the Tottenham goal. Florent Malouda scored the fifth as a dispirited Tottenham continued to make defensive errors, putting Chelsea into the final against Liverpool next month and boosting the team ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg against Barcelona . Liverpool beat archrivals Everton 2-1 in Saturday's semifinal at Wembley. The match was played a day before the anniversary of the April 14, 1989 tragedy that saw 96 Liverpool fans crushed to death during an FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield -- one of the worst disasters in football history. Meanwhile in the Scottish Cup, Celtic's double hopes were ended by a 2-1 defeat to Hearts. The winner from Hearts also proved controversial with Celtic manager Neil Lennon confronting referee Euan Norris at the end of the match. With the scores 1-1, Norris awarded Hearts a penalty when a Marius Zaliukas shot struck Joe Ledley on the arm. Craig Beattie scored from the spot before Celtic were denied a penalty in stoppage time when Andy Webster appeared to handle in the box.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo beat his own La Liga scoring record on Saturday as Real Madrid maintained a four-point advantage over rivals Barcelona with a 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon. The Portugal international's header in the 74th minute took his tally of goals to 41 this season -- a mark equaled later in the night by Lionel Messi as Barcelona beat Levante 2-1. Ronaldo's record-breaking goal was a vital one, putting Madrid ahead for the first time in the game after Miguel De Las Cuevas had given Gijon the lead from the penalty spot in the 30th minute. Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain pulled one back before halftime but Ronaldo's effort guided a lackluster Madrid towards three vital points. Five minutes later Gijon defender Roberto Canella was dismissed by the referee for a second bookable offense which paved the way for France forward Karim Benzema to add a third in the 82nd minute. The loss left Sporting struggling down in 19th place on 28 points three points ahead of bottom-side Racing Santander (who travel to Villarreal on Sunday) and level on points with Real Zaragoza who host Granada, also on Sunday. Barcelona also had to come from behind in their match at Levante after Jose Barkero gave the home side the lead from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute. Barcelona passed and probed without much joy until the 63rd minute when, inevitably, Lionel Messi put his side back on level terms with a curling effort from the edge of the box. Six minutes later they were awarded a controversial penalty when the linesman flagged for a challenge on Isaac Cuenca by Pedro Botelho after the referee had waved play on. A gaggle of furious Levante players protested to the officials in vain before Messi stepped up to put an unstoppable spot kick past goalkeeper Gustavo Munua. The Argentine's two goals took his tally in all competitions this season to an incredible 63. With five league games left, Madrid have 85 points to Barcelona's 81.","Cristiano Ronaldo takes league tally to 41 goals as Madrid win 3-1 win Sporting Gijon .

"(CNN) -- Police are looking for the husband of a bride who was found stabbed to death in her bathtub on Sunday. She was still in the sequined cocktail dress she wore to her wedding reception, police said. Authorities in the Chicago suburb of Burbank, Illinois, are looking for Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, on a first-degree murder warrant in the death of Estrella Carrera, 26. Jimenez is still at large, police said. Jimenez and Carrera were married on Friday at City Hall in Chicago, according to authorities. Carrera's cousin, Sandy Lopez, told CNN affiliate WBBM the couple had been together for three years. They celebrated their union with family and friends with dinner and a limo ride to at least one nightclub, according to police. The newlyweds were dropped off around 4 a.m. on Saturday, and proceeded home, police said. ""She was happy. She was fine. Did nothing out of the ordinary at all,"" Lopez told WBBM. On Saturday relatives called police to say Carrera had failed to pick up her children, ages 2 and 8, police said Monday. Police later found Carrera, wearing the same dress she wore at her reception, dead in the bathtub of her home. There were no signs of forced entry, police said. ""(I)t is important to know that this appears to be an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation and the investigation is continuing,"" police said Monday, before obtaining the warrant. Lopez told WBBM she had ""no idea why somebody would do this to her."" Jimenez was last seen driving a black 2006 Maserati. Burbank Police, in conjunction with the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force, continue to investigate the case.

"(CNN) -- Mario Balotelli's career at Manchester City is hanging in the balance after manager Roberto Mancini gave the clearest indication yet that he is willing to sell the troubled striker. Mancini admitted his patience was wearing thin with the 21-year-old Italian who was sent off for the third time this season in Man City's 1-0 defeat at Arsenal on Sunday. When asked if Balotelli would be sold, Mancini said: ""Probably -- but I don't know. It depends, because Balotelli is a fantastic player. ""Every time we risk one (man being) sent off, like today. But he can score also in the last minute. ""It's clear he's created big problems, but he's scored important goals. ""He needs to change his behavior if he wants to improve his life. I've seen players finish in two or three years with huge talent. He needs to change."" Sunday's loss leaves City eight points behind arch rivals Manchester United, dealing a potentially fatal blow to their Premier League title hopes. Balotelli, who has earned a reputation for his controversial antics both on and off the pitch, was red-carded for a foul on Barcary Sagna on Sunday. He could also receive a retrospective punishment from the English Football Association for a dangerous tackle on Alex Song earlier in the game which match officials failed to see. Replays showed Balotelli going in knee-high on the Arsenal midfielder, who escaped serious injury. But despite last week admitting Balotelli was so frustrating he would punch him if they were teammates, Mancini refused to condemn the footballer outright. ""I love him as a guy, I love him as a player, because I know him. He's not a bad guy. He's a fantastic player,"" he said. ""But, at this moment, I'm very sorry because he continues to lose his talent, his quality. ""I hope, for him, that he can understand that he's in a bad way for his future, and he can change his behavior in the future."" It is the latest controversy for the forward who crashed his Bentley in Manchester city center last week. But with six games left for City this season and hopes of a first English title in 44 years all but dead in the water, Mancini's own position at the club will also be under scrutiny. He insisted he was ""100%"" the right man for the job, saying: ""When I arrived, City were seventh or eighth. After six months, we were fighting for the Champions League and lost to Tottenham one game from the end.""","Manchester City manager Robert Mancini admits Mario Balotelli may be sold .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge who oversees Britney Spears' conservatorship will consider a request to appoint a conservator to oversee Zsa Zsa Gabor's finances and medical care. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz scheduled a hearing for May 2 for the conservatorship petition filed Tuesday by Francesca Hilton, Gabor's daughter. The Hungarian-born actress was once one of Hollywood's most glamorous women, but a broken hip and leg amputation in the past two years have left her confined to a bed. Hilton contends that Gabor's ninth husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, is keeping her ""increasingly isolated"" and ""heavily sedated,"" and she questions his handling of Gabor's finances. ""What Ms. Hilton is seeking here is for the court to make sure that Zsa Zsa's best interests are not being sacrificed for the selfish interests of anyone involved in Zsa Zsa's life,"" said Hilton lawyer Kenneth Kossoff. Von Anhalt, 68, called a news conference at his home Tuesday to dispute the need for a conservator. ""My wife doesn't complain,"" he said. ""She says she's in a good condition, she feels good."" His lawyer, Edward Lee, said he had not yet seen the court filing. ""Anything that's contesting Frederic's devotion to his wife or his ability to take care of his wife is ridiculous,"" Lee said . The petition questions why von Anhalt recently borrowed $700,000 on Gabor's $10 million Bel Air mansion, while the house reportedly is in foreclosure after several missed mortgage payments. ""In spite of her conflicts with von Anhalt, Francesca has been hoping he had Zsa Zsa's interests at heart,"" Kossoff said. ""However, having just recently learned that he took out a $700,000 loan, and that there was a notice of default recorded against the property in late February 2012 because he apparently has not been paying Zsa Zsa's mortgage payment, it became clear to Francesca that if she did not seek to protect her mother, no one else would."" Von Anhalt, at his news conference said his step daughter was picking on him ""at the worst time."" ""We are right now going through a very hard time, my wife and me,"" he said. ""We have to sell our property in order to pay our debts. My wife has $6 million in debts."" He acknowledged taking out the new loan on the property, saying it was needed to pay his wife's medical bills and to catch up on missed mortgage payments. The mansion, however, is not in foreclosure, he said. ""There was a document filed in court 14 days ago,"" he said. ""It was wrongly filed. The bank apologized already."" Hilton and von Anhalt have publicly battled for several years over Gabor's finances and her access to her mother. ""He's basically taken my mother away from me,"" Hilton told CNN in an interview a year ago. Von Anhalt, in an interview with CNN, said he limits his step-daughter's access because she brings negativity into the room. ""I want smiling people in here, happy smiling people,"" he said. He defended his care of Gabor, saying, ""I'm going to make sure she has a good life, as long as I live, I will take care of her."" With Tuesday's filing, Hilton hopes to take that responsibility away from von Anhalt. The family feud intensified after Gabor broke her hip when she fell in July 2011. ""My mother's husband has increasingly isolated my mother from others who have been close to her,"" Hilton said in the court filing. ""Before she broke her hip, my mother and I spoke several times every day. Since she broke her hip, her husband has removed the telephone that used to be by her bed."" Von Anhalt allows Hilton, Gabor's only child, to visit her mother only when a lawyer and doctor are present, she said. She became alarmed during her last two visits on November 27, 2011, and February 8, 2012, ""because my mother seemed heavily sedated, and I had not seen her in that state before,"" Hilton said. She also raised concern about ""remnants of some bedsores"" and ""lesions on my mother's face."" Gabor's right leg was amputated a year ago because of gangrene, leaving her unable to care or dress herself, she said. Hilton's petition calls for ""competent and independent medical professionals"" to advise on her care. ""I am very concerned that her medical needs and treatment are not being managed in her best interest."" ""I also believe that my mother now may suffer from a loss of intellectual and emotional faculties, which may be induced by the medication my mother is being given,"" she said. Von Anhalt, 68, maintains a high media profile, including a run for governor of California in 2010 that he halted after his wife's hip injury. He is currently an announced candidate for mayor of Los Angeles. He made news several years ago when he claimed to be the father of Anna Nicole Smith's daughter after the actress's death. Paternity tests later disproved that claim. Last year, von Anhalt announced that he wanted Gabor to become a mother again using an egg donor, artificial insemination and a surrogate mother. ""That's just weird,"" Hilton said at the time. ""I'm a retired guy,"" von Anhalt said then. ""I can take care of it."" The unusual motherhood plan was never hatched. Von Anhalt is 27 years younger than Gabor, whom he married more than 25 years ago.","NEW: A hearing is set on Francesca Hilton's conservatorship petition for her mother .

"(CNN) -- A possible constitutional crisis loomed in Malawi following the reported death of President Bingu wa Mutharika, once hailed as a positive steward for the southern African country. Mutharika, 78, died of a heart attack on Thursday and his body was flown to South Africa, according to government sources. However, there was no formal government statement announcing his death, and the chaotic politics of the impoverished nation raised questions about what happens next. Under the constitution, Vice President Joyce Banda would succeed Mutharika. However, Banda was expelled from the ruling Democratic People's Party in 2010 in a dispute with Mutharika over the president's efforts to position his brother rather than the vice president as his eventual successor. Banda formed her own party, but remained vice president. A government spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of the president's death but declared that the vice president cannot take over the presidency. ""The conduct of the honorable Joyce Banda in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency,"" said Patricia Kaliati, who serves as information and civic education minister. In a news conference earlier Friday, Banda told reporters she was kept ""in the dark"" regarding the president's condition. However, the Malawi defence forces, which provides security for the sitting president, shifted security members to Banda's residence amid news of the death. While declining to comment on the president's condition, Kaliati appealed to Malawi residents to remain calm and only listen to information coming from official government sources. The United States and Britain have urged Malawi to observe the succession process in the constitution. ""We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power. We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly,"" said Johnnie Carson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. During her news conference, Banda, along with former President Bakili Muluzi, called on Malawians to adhere to the constitution regarding the issue of succession. Mutharika, a former World Bank economist who studied in the United States and other countries, was elected president in 2004 after campaigning as an ""economic engineer."" He won re-election five years later for a term scheduled to end in 2014. His initial years in office were considered a success as he focused on battling corruption and working to improve the economy. He implemented a subsidy program for agricultural products that was credited with boosting the economy of the largely agrarian nation. Malawians welcomed his focus on reducing reliance on food aid and attaining self-sufficiency. However, his popularity plunged in recent years as the economy faltered and the nation faced chronic fuel shortages and frequent power blackouts. Anti-government groups accused Mutharika of dragging Malawi back into a dictatorship, citing the passage of bills they say infringe on citizen rights. Protesters took to the streets last year demanding immediate government action to address the economic plight. Security forces cracked down, leading to more than a dozen deaths and sparking international condemnation. Critics also accused Mutharika of jeopardizing international relations and risking foreign aid that benefits the nation's poor. Last year, Mutharika expelled a British envoy who was quoted criticizing him in a leaked diplomatic cable, straining relations with one of Malawi's largest foreign donors. In return, Britain asked Malawi's top envoy to leave the country and rescinded her invitation to the royal wedding. At the time, London said it was halting ""all general budget support"" to the nation. Last month, the United States announced it was suspending $350 million allocated to Malawi because of concerns about its democratic governance. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse and journalist Gregory Gondwe contributed to this report.","NEW: Government official declares vice president ineligible for presidency .

"(CNN) -- Five people in southern China have been charged with intentional injury after illegally buying one of the kidneys of a teenage boy, who used the money at least in part for an iPhone and an iPad, according to state media. The five, including a surgeon, removed the organ in April 2011 from the 17-year-old high school student from China's Anhui province. The teenager is now suffering from renal insufficiency, Xinhua reported. The boy's condition is deteriorating, it said. One of the defendants, a man named He Wei, was described as ""penniless and frustrated over gambling debts"" and allegedly ""sought to make enormous earnings through illegal kidney trading,"" the news agency reported. It said the men identified donors through online chat rooms and conducted the operation at a hospital. A man named Song Zhongyu, a surgeon from a provincial hospital in Yunnan province, received nearly $35,000 in the deal, while the boy was given about $3,500, Xinhua said. Wang later confessed to his mother when she confronted him about where he got the money for the Apple products, the news agency said. According to China's Ministry of Health, about 1.5 million people in the country are in need of transplants, and yet only 10,000 transplants are performed each year, Xinhua reported.","A surgeon removed the organ in April 2011 from a high school student, Xinhua says .

"Washington (CNN) -- With time running out for Congress to prevent a doubling of interest rates on federal student loans, the White House and Republican leaders exchanged accusations Thursday on who was to blame for the lack of an agreement. President Barack Obama chided Republicans for holding up a deal with unreasonable demands, and he urged college students to continue raising their voices on the issue. However, spokesmen for Republican leaders in the House and Senate denied an assertion by press secretary Jay Carney that the White House has been working with them to try to reach a deal. Asked about GOP complaints that the White House has not reached out to Republicans on the issue in recent days, Carney said that ""we are actively working with members of Congress to get this done,"" adding, ""in both parties."" Spokesmen for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, disputed Carney's account. On the Senate floor, McConnell accused Obama and Democrats of playing political games on the issue. ""It is the Democrat-led Senate that has failed to act and the president who has failed to contribute to a solution, and the reason is obvious,"" McConnell said. ""It was reported yesterday that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching a website with a student loan countdown clock aimed at raising money off this issue. The implication is that Republicans are the ones dragging their feet. "" The only reason the issue remains unresolved ""is that the president wants to keep it alive,"" McConnell said, adding that ""he thinks it benefits him politically for college students to believe we're the problem."" Despite such political back-and-forth, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said that ""a series of meetings over the last 48 hours"" with Republicans had raised hopes for a deal. ""At this stage, it appears that they are compromising, just as we are, and hope we can get something done,"" Reid said. Leaders of both parties insist that they want to keep the federally backed rate at 3.4% for another year, but they sharply disagree over how to pay the $6 billion cost. Democrats want to eliminate certain tax benefits for small-business owners, while Republicans want to cut a preventive-care fund created in 2010 as part of Obama's health care reform law. The Republican-majority House has passed its version of the measure, which Obama has threatened to veto. The Senate continues to negotiate an alternative version. If Congress fails to act by July 1, the rate jumps to 6.8%, with an average cost to students of $1,000 in increased loan debt, according to the White House. In his remarks at the White House to students campaigning for an extension of the current rate, Obama blamed Republicans for preventing a deal. ""Last month, Democrats in the Senate put forward a plan that would have kept these rates in place without adding a dime to the deficit. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans got together and blocked it,"" Obama said. ""Over in the House, the Republicans said they'd keep these rates down only if we agreed to cut things like preventative health care for women, which obviously wouldn't fix the problem but would create a new problem,"" the president continued. He also poked fun at an unidentified congressman, presumably Republican, who Obama said had warned that the student loan rate issue was about giving students ""free college education."" That complaint ""doesn't make much sense, because the definition of a loan is, it's not free; you have to pay it back,"" Obama said. While Obama has repeatedly raised the issue in campaign appearances, certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has also said Congress should act to keep the rate at 3.4%. In 2007, lawmakers temporarily cut the rate for undergraduates taking out federal Stafford loans up to the 2011 school year. The lower rates were phased in, so students have been able to access the lowest 3.4% rate on subsidized federal loans for only one school year. The 2007 law allows interest rates to revert back to 6.8% for the 2012-13 school year, which starts in July. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Alan Silverleib and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen. McConnell says it is Democrats stalling progress to score political points .

"(CNN) -- It has been 17 years since France had a president from the left, but that might be about to change. Opinion polls continue to favor Francois Hollande, a candidate from the center-left Socialist Party, over center-right incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in the upcoming French presidential election. If elected, Hollande would be the first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand in 1995. Sarkozy is seeking his second five-year term, following Jacques Chirac, who served 12 years in office. As the French take to the polls Sunday, here are a few key points to keep in mind: . 1. This is a two-horse race, but other candidates matter. While there are actually 10 candidates taking part in the presidential race, spanning the entire political spectrum, polls show that only two candidates -- Sarkozy and Hollande -- have a realistic chance of winning the French presidency. But it will be important to watch how many votes the other candidates get Sunday. That's because those votes will almost certainly be up for grabs in a runoff election two weeks later. In France, a presidential candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to win office. If no one claims a majority in the first round of voting -- and no one ever has in this current system -- the top two vote-getters advance to a second round of voting. ""The other candidates have to be given some attention because they exert an influence in the race,"" said Michael Leruth, who teaches a course about the election at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. ""For example, if (far-left candidate Jean-Luc) Melenchon continues to do well and has even a slightly strong showing, Hollande might have to tack more to the left in the runoff round. ""If you're coming out of the first round with 27%, 28%, you need to make it to 50%. So you have to think of where you are going to make up that difference to prevail in the final round."" Another candidate to watch is on the far right. Marine Le Pen, daughter of 2002 presidential finalist Jean-Marie Le Pen, is polling well behind Sarkozy and Hollande, but she's still in the double digits with Melenchon. A strong showing from her Sunday might have an effect on Sarkozy's strategy going into the runoff. 2012 a year of elections: Return of the Left? 2. One issue stands out among the rest. The economy dominates the political agenda in France, much like it does in America. ""Basically for months now, the top issues have been unemployment and purchasing power,"" said Jim Bittermann, CNN's correspondent in Paris. Jobs have been difficult to come by, especially for young people, and that is one of the main reasons why Sarkozy is vulnerable. ""Even though some people would give Sarkozy high marks for doing the kinds of things that might have a positive long-term effect on the economy -- like raising the retirement age to put the system on sounder fiscal footing -- he hasn't been successful in bringing jobs back,"" Leruth said. Comparing Sarkozy and Hollande on their economic policy is not unlike comparing Republicans and Democrats in the United States. ""Hollande is in favor of more government action to stimulate the economy, stimulate spending ... whereas Sarkozy wants to improve the climate for business by lowering some taxes, by talking about repealing the law establishing the 35-hour work week -- a Socialist measure from the late '90s -- to make it possible to work more,"" Leruth said. ""It's more of a private-sector approach."" 3. France and America have more in common than just high unemployment. Immigration, race and the assimilation of France's large Muslim community have been prominent issues leading up to the election, even before the March shootings by an Islamic extremist in Toulouse and Montauban. Sarkozy has been tough on immigration. Last year, a law went into effect banning Islamic face coverings in public places, the so-called burqa ban. And in a recent television interview, Sarkozy said France has ""too many foreigners"" and that the country is not integrating them properly. Sarkozy won the 2007 election by taking a strong stance on race, according to political analyst Simon Persico from the Center of European Studies. But Le Pen, this year's far-right candidate, says Sarkozy hasn't been strong enough while in office. ""Le Pen is saying the original is better than the copy, and that voters should not believe Sarkozy on race,"" he told CNN. 4. The election's result could affect the eurozone. Sarkozy has worked closely with German Chancellor Angela Merkel throughout the European debt crisis, leading the way for strict austerity measures in Greece and other troubled countries. Would Hollande's election encourage a change in strategy? ""There is concern that, within the eurozone, Hollande's election could create greater instability,"" Leruth said. ""He's talked about renegotiating some of the accords that have been reached -- at the instigation of Sarkozy and Merkel -- to ensure greater stability in the eurozone."" The reason is long-term growth. ""I think some of the French like the way (Sarkozy) handled -- with Merkel -- the agreement in December to get more rigor, more austerity into European budgets. But then Hollande and other economists are saying we also need growth, and these plans are going to absolutely stifle growth,"" said Homer Sutton, a French professor at Davidson College near Charlotte, North Carolina. Like Leruth, he is teaching a course on the election. France's own debt is also a concern. Like the United States, the country recently had its AAA credit rating downgraded. Hollande has promised to create tens of thousands of public-sector jobs and raise taxes on the rich to pay for it. But some are concerned that might encourage the rich to just leave France. ""There's some feeling that if Hollande is elected, the attack on the French sovereign debt could be quite serious,"" Sutton said. ""And this is what Sarkozy has been saying: 'If you elect Hollande, we're going to be losing more than our AAA. We'll be going down even further.' "" 5. Franco-American relations should remain strong. Hollande has pledged to remove French troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year if he is elected. Whether it's a realistic goal or not, that could create some tension between Paris and Washington. But Hollande is known for being a no-nonsense pragmatist. ""Hollande knows that he needs the United States and that the United States needs Europe, so I think there would be a great deal of cooperation there,"" Sutton said. Sutton recalled Mitterrand's election in 1981 and how there were initial concerns about him. ""Everyone said, 'Oh, he's got four communists in his government, this is going to be the end of the relationship with the United States.' But it turns out that he was a very strong defender of American missiles in Germany, for example,"" Sutton said. ""Mitterrand's friendship with (Chancellor) Helmut Kohl, it was a strong French-German relationship, and (U.S. President Ronald) Reagan and Mitterrand didn't get along too badly despite their ideological differences.""","France's presidential election begins Sunday, to be followed by a runoff in two weeks .

"(EW.com) -- Stephen King's fantasy novel ""Eyes of the Dragon"" could at last become a movie or miniseries. The 1987 bestseller is being developed by Syfy as a longform project, along with a scripted drama series based on the comic ""Grey Legion"" and two high-concept movie projects. The network is set to announce all the titles later today at its upfront presentation in New York City. Michael Taylor (""Battlestar Galactica"") and Jeff Vintar (""I, Robot"") will pen the ""Dragon"" script, with Taylor and Bill Haber as executive producers. ""Dragon"" is a rarity among King's early works: A stand-alone novel that hasn't been previously adapted into a live-action feature. In fact, among King's pre-1990 books that were first published under his own name, only his fantasy titles (""Eyes of the Dragon,"" ""The Talisman"" and the ""Dark Tower"" books) haven't yet been adapted, though all have been in development at one point or another. And given HBO's success with its fantasy hit ""Game of Thrones,"" the timing for ""Dragon"" couldn't be better. ""Dragon"" takes place in fictional realm of Delain and follows a teenage prince who is falsely accused of murdering his father, the king. Imprisoned in a high tower, the prince must figure out a way to escape, clear his name, and confront the devious and powerful wizard who is responsible for his father's death. Though ""Dragon"" was aimed at younger readers than most of the author's books, the story also has plenty of characteristically dark touches. The tale also has some overlapping mythology with King's ""Dark Tower"" novels, including sharing a villain (Flagg) who was also in one of King's most beloved works, ""The Stand."" In addition, Syfy is developing a drama series called ""Seeing Things."" Based on the comic ""Grey Legion"" from Platinum Studios, ""Seeing Things"" is about a cop who meets a violent demise but returns as a ghost to close his last case. The only person who can help him is a socially awkward man who is realizing for the first time that his hallucinations may not be all in his head. David Slack (""Person of Interest,"" ""Lie To Me"") and Gabrielle Stanton (""Haven,"" ""The Vampire Diaries"") will write. Slack, Robert Cort and Scott Mitchell Rosenberg will executive produce the project from Fox Television Studios. Another movie/mini project in the works at Syfy is ""Darkfall,"" from Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris (""Kung Fu Panda,"" ""Sleeper Cell""). Logline: ""When, without warning, modern forms of power and technology become a thing of the past, Los Angeles, and the world at large, becomes a place where magic rules and life as we know it is turned upside down."" Jim Henson Company and Universal Cable Productions will produce. Syfy is also developing a movie called ""One Mile Straight Down."" Logline: ""When a powerful earthquake hits California and opens up a chasm bigger than the Grand Canyon, it reveals an enormous hidden ocean lying deep beneath the earth's crust. Billionaire adventurer James Exeter works with the government to take an advanced nuclear submarine down to explore it and discovers more than he ever could have imagined."" Skip Woods (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""), Naren Shankar (""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"") and Deran Sarafian (""CSI: NY"") will write and executive produce this one from Universal Cable Productions.

"(CNN) -- On the night of February 26, Trayvon Martin was wearing a hoodie and had bought Skittles and an Arizona tea at a convenience store in Sanford, Florida. Some time after that, he was shot and killed by neighborhood watch member George Zimmerman. But beyond those established facts about the shooting of the unarmed teenager in an Orlando suburb last month, much is in dispute about the case that has gripped the nation. Of the two people directly involved, Martin will never be able to describe what happened, and Zimmerman has kept mum. His lawyer vows that, once all the facts surface, things will not appear as clear-cut as they are to many of Martin's supporters at the moment. America will have to wait and see as State Attorney Angela Corey plunges deeper into a case charged with allegations of racism. Martin was African-American; Zimmerman is a Hispanic who, his family says, has been wrongly described as racist. What's clear is that, as more is learned about this case, it becomes more complicated. The little information that has surfaced has been through 911 tapes, what Zimmerman told police and the accounts of witnesses who helped paint a picture of the night Martin died. George Zimmerman . Zimmerman was wearing a red jacket and blue jeans when he came across Martin on that night. He was a neighborhood watch member carrying a Kel-Tec 9 mm pistol, according to a police report. He said he was on his way to a grocery store when he spotted Martin walking through the Retreat at Twin Lakes, according to the Orlando Sentinel, which pieced together an account of what happened based on leaked information from investigators. Sanford police said the newspaper account ""is consistent with the information provided to the State Attorney's office by the police department."" Martin was visiting his father's fiancee, who lived in the gated community in Sanford, a racially mixed northern suburb of Orlando. Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious person. He described Martin as black and said he was acting strangely and could have been on drugs. Zimmerman said he got out of his SUV and followed Martin on foot. ""Something's wrong with him,"" he told a 911 dispatcher, according to the contents of a call released by authorities. ""Yep. He's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands."" The teenager started to run, Zimmerman said. A 911 dispatcher asked Zimmerman whether he was following Martin, and Zimmerman said he was. The dispatcher said Zimmerman did not need to do that. Zimmerman said he lost sight of Martin and began walking back to his SUV; Martin approached him, according to the Sentinel account. Martin asked Zimmerman if he had a problem; Zimmerman said no and reached for his cell phone, he told police. Martin said, ""Well, you do now"" or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the nose, Zimmerman said, according to the Sentinel. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk. The police report described Zimmerman's back as wet and covered with grass, as though he had been lying on the ground. Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and the back of his head, the police report said. ""I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help me,"" Zimmerman told police. By the time police arrived on the scene, Martin was dead from a gunshot wound in the chest, according to Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee. The unarmed teenager was lying face-down. Zimmerman told police that he shot Martin. And that he did it in self-defense. 911 calls . Residents of the gated community heard the gunshot. Seven 911 calls released by authorities document their fear. Someone screams, ""help, help!"" in the background. ""There were gunshots right outside my house. There's someone screaming. I just heard a guy shot,"" a neighbor says. ""Hurry up, they are right outside my house."" Another man cries for help. Then the gunshot. ""Hurry, please. ... There's someone screaming outside,"" a neighbor whispers. ""There's a gunshot. Hurry up. ... There's someone screaming. I just heard a gunshot."" In another call, a woman begs the dispatchers to send help, saying someone is ""screaming and hollering"" for help. Moments later, she describes a light at the scene of the shooting. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""There's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight."" Zimmerman's call to police was among the 911 tapes released by police. Some people hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Mary Cutcher and Selma Mora Lamilla . Mary Cutcher was in her kitchen making coffee that night with her roommate, Selma Mora Lamilla. The window was open, she said. ""We heard a whining. Not like a crying, boohoo, but like a whining, someone in distress, and then the gunshot,"" she said. They looked out the window but saw nothing. It was dark. They ran out the sliding glass door, and within seconds, they saw Zimmerman. ""Zimmerman was standing over the body with -- basically straddling the body with his hands on Trayvon's back,"" Cutcher said. ""And it didn't seem to me that he was trying to help him in any way. I didn't hear any struggle prior to the gunshot. ""And I feel like it was Trayvon Martin that was crying out, because the minute that the gunshot went off, the whining stopped."" The two women said they could not see whether Zimmerman was bruised or hurt. It was too dark. ""Selma asked him three times, 'what's going on over there?' "" Cutcher said. ""He looks back and doesn't say anything. She asks him again, 'everything OK? What's going on?' Same thing: looked at us, looked back. Finally, the third time, he said, 'just call the police.' "" Anonymous witness . A witness who asked not to be identified, even by gender, told CNN's Anderson Cooper about hearing voices outside in an area where neighborhood residents often walk their dogs and wondering, ""Oh, my gosh, who's out there walking their dog in the rain?"" Then the witness heard a ""very loud, predominant voice"" and opened the window. ""I couldn't hear the words, but it was like, OK, this is not a regular conversation. This is someone aggressively, you know, yelling at someone."" The witness recalled seeing two men on the grass, one on top of the other. ""And at that point, not looking out the window, I heard the yell for help, one yell for help, and then I heard another ... excruciating type of yell,"" the witness said. ""It didn't almost sound like 'help.' It just sounded so painful. But I wasn't watching out the window during that. And then the next time I looked out the window, there's the same thing: two men on the grass, one on top of each other. I couldn't see a lot of movement. It was very dark, but I felt like they were scuffling. And then I heard the gunshots, which, to me, were more like pops than they were like a bang."" The witness recalled hearing more than one shot. ""It definitely was more than one pop noise, so I don't know if it was an echo or anything else. But it definitely made more than one pop."" Then one of the men, who appeared to be Hispanic, started walking toward the witness' vantage point, the witness said. Zimmerman is Hispanic. ""He didn't appear hurt or anything else,"" the witness said. Martin's girlfriend . Benjamin Crump, the Martin family lawyer, says Martin's girlfriend's account of what happened connects the dots and destroys Zimmerman's claims of self-defense. The girl, who did not want to be identified, said she was on the phone with the teen before the shooting. When Zimmerman got closer to Martin, she told her boyfriend to run, but Martin told her that he was not going to run, she said. ""What are you stopping me for?"" Martin asked Zimmerman, according to the girl. ""What are you doing around here?"" Zimmerman asked in response. The girl said she then got the impression that an altercation was taking place and that someone had pushed Martin, because the headset fell out of his ear, and the phone shut off. Zimmerman's friend . Joe Oliver said Zimmerman filled Oliver in on what happened between the time Martin came face to face with him and when the gun was fired -- the part that's not all clear. Oliver said he could not divulge what Zimmerman said, just that the gun went off. Corey, the state attorney, was asked whether that meant the shooting might have been accidental. ""We look into that in every shooting case,"" Corey said. Oliver said Zimmerman was badly hurt that night. He went to a doctor the next day to be treated for a broken nose. ""He hasn't been back to his apartment, which is in that complex, ever since that happened, and he's being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, for depression, for insomnia,"" Oliver said. ""He cried for days after this happened. The George Zimmerman I know is not here anymore, because he knows that he took someone else's life, and he's extremely remorseful."" Zimmerman has not been charged, sparking a firestorm of protest across America. Corey's homicide staff, meanwhile, continues to work around the clock.","The case becomes more complicated as details emerge .

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League has rejected a proposal to bring Scottish Premier League sides Celtic and Rangers into English football's top flight. The Glasgow-based sides, who have dominated their own league both competitively and financially in recent years, had hoped to be part of plans submitted by Bolton chairman Phil Gartside who is keen on a two-tier league of between 36 and 40 teams. Both Celtic and Rangers would have been invited to join the lower of the two leagues under the plan, but the proposal was overwhelmingly rejected. English Premier League clubs will now consider whether to introduce a two-tier system as part of a wider strategic review. A statement from the Premier League said: ""Bolton Wanderers submitted a discussion paper detailing ideas concerning the restructuring of the Premier League into two tiers with the inclusion of Celtic and Rangers. ""The clubs welcomed the additional input into an ongoing process, however, they were of the opinion that bringing Celtic and Rangers into any form of Premier League set-up was not desirable or viable. ""The other relevant ideas contained within Bolton's paper will now be taken forward as part of the wider strategic review being undertaken by the Premier League since November 2008 with the aim of providing recommendations before December 2010."" The rejection comes as Rangers revealed that they made a loss of nearly $22 million last year, compared with a profit of $11.3m the previous year. Rangers are currently seeking new owners, with former chairman David Murray keen to off-load his controlling stake. The club have also been hit by a fine by governing body UEFA for crowd trouble during their Champions League match against Unirea Urziceni on November 4 in Romania. Rangers have been fined $30,000 for the behaviour of their supporters while Romanian outfit have been hit with a fine of around $12,000 for their organisation at the Group G clash.","The English Premier League have rejected a proposal to bring Celtic and Rangers into English football's top flight .

"(CNN) -- Nine men have been charged with hazing for their alleged part in an initiation rite into a University of Florida fraternity earlier this year. The defendants, between the ages of 21 and 26, are accused of ""endangering the mental or physical health or safety"" of five pledges to the Alpha Phi Alpha chapter, according to documents filed this week in Florida's 8th Judicial Circuit court. In that document, the nine are accused of ""striking (the pledges) with paddles and/or striking with hands and/or requiring the performance of calisthenics"" on January 22. No other details have been released. In February, days after the case came to light, university President Bernie Machen announced in an e-mail to students that Alpha Phi Alpha was being temporarily suspended in light of what he called a ""serious physical hazing incident."" Dave Kratzer, Florida's vice president for student affairs, added at the time that no one was hospitalized after the incident but that the school felt compelled to act, regardless. ""It's not in the realm of seriousness on the far end of things, when you think about what could have occurred with hazing, and we want to stop it now,"" Kratzer told CNN. The executive director of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. said at the time that a cease-and-desist order was issued against the local chapter and stressed that ""hazing is dangerous and illegal and must stop!"" The historically black fraternity dates back to 1906, when it was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. According to its website, Alpha Phi Alpha ""has a zero tolerance level in regards to hazing/pledging and strongly prohibits these illegal activities in any form."" The alleged hazing incident happened off the school's Gainesville campus, according to Machen's e-mail to students, which was obtained by CNN. The charges in the University of Florida case were filed Monday, two days before charges were announced against 13 people tied to an investigation into the case of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion -- whose November 2011 death, authorities have said, was a result of hazing. FAMU hazing suspects turning themselves in . Eleven of those individuals face one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death, which is punishable by up to six years in prison, according to officials. By contrast, the hazing charges in the University of Florida case are all misdemeanors, said Spencer Mann, a spokesman for 8th Judicial Circuit State Attorney William Cervone's office. If convicted, these men could be sentenced to one year in prison and be forced to pay as much as a $1,000 fine. The FAMU incident prompted Florida Gov. Rick Scott to order all state universities to examine their hazing and harassment policies in December. Scott also asked all university presidents to remind their students, faculty and staff ""how detrimental hazing can be.""","NEW: The misdemeanor charges are punishable by up to one year in prison .

"(CNN) -- The estranged wife of former football star Deion Sanders was released from custody Tuesday in suburban Dallas and said she hasn't been given a ""fair shake"" over allegations that she attacked him. Pilar Sanders was arrested on domestic violence-related charges Monday night, hours after Sanders sent a series of bizarre tweets saying she assaulted him. ""I understand that I have very little chance at beating a Hall of Fame, two-sport man that everyone seems to love and adore,"" said Pilar Sanders, proclaiming her innocence. ""I'm a full-time mom, 100% for my children,"" she said tearfully. ""And I just haven't been given a fair shake."" The Collin County Sheriff's Office said Pilar Sanders, under an emergency protective order, is forbidden from returning to the couple's home for 61 days and cannot threaten or harass any member of the family. In one of the messages posted on his verified Twitter account, Deion Sanders posted a picture of what he said were his children filling out complaints to give to police in Texas. ""Pray for me and my kids now! They just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room,"" the first tweet, posted at 6:15 p.m., read. ""She's going to jail n I'm pressing charges!"" Two minutes later, Sanders tweeted again. ""I'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but I warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys. This is on my mama!"" it said. Shortly after that, Sanders tweeted a picture that showed him and his two boys, 10 and 12, filling out paperwork. ""Filling out police reports now! Thank God for this platform to issue the Truth,"" the caption read. Pilar Sanders was booked into jail Monday night on suspicion of assault family violence, a misdemeanor, according to booking records at the Collin County Jail. Bail was set at $264. ""I can tell you that there are two sides to every story, and the truth will come out in court,"" Larry Friedman, an attorney for Pilar Sanders, said Tuesday. Deion Sanders played for several NFL teams, including the San Francisco 49ers, the Dallas Cowboys and the Atlanta Falcons. He was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame and works as an analyst for the NFL Network. During much of his NFL career, he also was an outfielder with four Major League Baseball teams and played in a World Series with the Atlanta Braves. The NFL Network and Sanders' business manager, Constance Schwartz, declined to comment about the incident. But a clearly emotional Sanders spoke to Dallas television station KXAS on Monday night and appealed for help. ""My kids, they are scared for their life,"" Sanders told the station. ""They just saw two women jump their dad in his own house, in his room, in my room. It's sad. ""I got locks on my doors right now,"" he added. ""Is somebody going to have to die? Is it going to be me before the court does something and get this woman out of my house? It's absurd."" The couple has three children together. Sanders has two other children from an earlier relationship. The couple married in 1999 and starred in a reality show, ""Deion & Pilar Prime Time Love,"" that aired on the Oxygen network. The marriage, soured, however, and the two are in the midst of a bitter divorce. In February, Pilar Sanders filed a suit against her husband and his aunt, Laura Jones. She said the aunt attacked her in their 10-bedroom, 29,000-square-foot home in Prosper, Texas, while Deion Sanders watched. At the time, the athlete tweeted that his wife was the aggressor and the aunt was in the home merely to fix his phone. Pilar Sanders also filed a separate suit against her husband and his daughter, Deiondra, after she called her stepmother a ""gold-digging (expletive)"" and ""the number one gold digger of the year"" in Twitter posts. In the second suit, Pilar Sanders demanded $200 million in damages for libelous and slanderous comments. She claims that her husband ""endorsed Deiondra's false statements"" and himself tweeted he was ""tired of all (Pilar's) lies and foolishness.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan missed her flight back home from a Hawaiian vacation, but she will be back in Los Angeles in time for an important court appearance Wednesday, her spokesman said Tuesday. Los Angeles County Judge Stephanie Sautner ordered Lohan to appear in court so she can determine whether the actress is keeping up with her probation provisions, including the requirement that she work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue. ""Lindsay was delayed in Hawaii due to a travel-related issue,"" Lohan spokesman Steve Honig said. ""She will be heading back this evening in time to appear in court tomorrow."" The missed flight, however, forced the cancellation of Lohan's interview with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, which was set to be taped Tuesday. ""Lindsay offered to tape 'Ellen' tomorrow, but the show was unable to shift things around, and tomorrow is their last day of taping for the season,"" Honig said. The ""Ellen"" interview was to be Lohan's only planned appearance to promote her just-published Playboy magazine photo spread. There is no indication that Lohan, 25, will have any difficulty in court Wednesday, compared with many of her numerous appearances in the past two years. Sautner sentenced Lohan to 30 days in jail last month after she admitted that she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction, but the sheriff sent her home after a few hours because of jail overcrowding. The judge also ordered the actress to work at least 12 days a month at the Los Angeles County morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court-ordered community service. She must also attend 18 psychotherapy sessions. If the actress stays on track, her probation would be eased March 29, Sautner said. If she doesn't keep up with the requirements, she will serve the additional 270 days behind bars, the judge said. ""This is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant's hands,"" Sautner told Lohan. When Sautner sentenced Lohan to 120 days in jail in May, she ended up serving 35 days of home confinement instead, because of jail overcrowding and state rules that give prisoners credit for good behavior. Prosecutors said Lohan missed 12 of 20 scheduled workdays at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, part of the court-ordered community service imposed in May when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. Lohan, 25, was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007. She also canceled 14 of 19 scheduled appointments for court-ordered psychotherapy, they said. ""From what I see of you, you need a structure,"" Sautner told Lohan last month, instructing her to return to court each month, starting December 14, to show she is complying with the schedule. Lindsay Lohan's legal woes, which began four years ago with two drunken driving arrests, have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes, and alcohol and drug test failures. Her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless Lohan breaks any laws before then. It has been extended several times because of violations, including the failed alcohol and drug tests. CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","Despite missing flight from Hawaii, Lohan will be in court Wednesday, spokesman says .

"Woodward, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Threats of another perilous outbreak of tornadoes appeared to fizzle Sunday, a day after powerful storms tied to the same weather system tore through the Midwest and Plains states. The National Weather Service had issued widespread tornado watches for several states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Iowa and Illinois. And several big cities -- including St. Louis, Missouri; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota -- were thought to be in the line of another stream of powerful storms. Yet while people in many of those areas experienced inclement weather and a handful of tornadoes were reported in several states, the impact paled compared to what others had experienced Saturday and into the early morning hours of Sunday. Survivors in hard-hit Oklahoma town: 'We are truly blessed' As of 10 p.m. CT, the service's Storm Prediction Center had received 10 reports of tornadoes on Sunday. Most of those were from mid-day -- the latest being a reported touchdown at 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET) in McLeod County in Minnesota -- but there was no immediate word of any significant damage during the day and night Sunday, especially in more populated located. The numbers of reported twisters were well below the 122 that the weather service said happened Saturday. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback told CNN that ""97 tornadoes touched down"" in his state, a figure not yet confirmed by the National Weather Service. Oklahoma was also hard-hit, with Gov. Mary Fallin declaring a state of emergency in 12 counties in order to help expedite resources. All the deaths tied to the weekend storm were in Woodward, a small northern Oklahoma city of about 12,000 people about 85 miles west of Enid. Frank Hobbie was confirmed dead along with two girls -- presumed to be Hobbie's 5- and 7-year-old daughters -- said medical examiner's office spokeswoman Amy Elliot. Woodward Mayor Roscoe Hill earlier said a father and his two children were inside their trailer at the Hidden Valley Mobile Home Park when the tornado rolled through and they were killed. Elliot identified one of the other dead as Derrin Juul. A 10-year-old girl also killed was found with him and is presumed to be Juul's daughter. Hill had said that two people died when the car they were in rolled over several times. Another 29 in Woodward were treated for injuries, said Matt Lehenbauer, the city's director of emergency management. ""This thing comes in the middle of the night. It caught us asleep, mostly,"" Hill told CNN. In addition to leveling 89 homes and 13 businesses, the storm ""took out"" the transmitter for the public siren and tornado notification system, and ""we lost our manual override"" when the electricity was knocked out, City Manager Alan Riffel said. Given that and timing of the tornado -- after midnight, and after other severe weather had barreled through -- Fallin said the human cost could have been even worse. ""It's remarkable that we didn't have more loss of life in Woodward,"" she told reporters late Sunday afternoon. Officials credited working early warning systems elsewhere in the region with preventing more fatalities. Advisories from the system were issued two days in advance, rather than just a matter of hours, and were ""remarkably accurate,"" said Brownback. ""People took it very seriously."" In southwest Iowa, officials evacuated the entire population -- roughly 300 people -- of the town of Thurman after a suspected tornado struck Saturday, damaging or destroying three out of every four homes. By early Sunday morning, many Thurman residents who took up temporary shelter at a high school in nearby Tabor were again in the path of a storm that spawned suspected tornadoes in neighboring Kansas. A sign in a park that bears the town's name is one of the few things still standing, said Mike Crecelius, Fremont County's emergency management director. ""That's about all there is. About 75% of the homes are damaged or destroyed,"" he said. ""From the looks of things, there won't be a tree left in that town either."" Four truckers whose rigs were blown off Interstate 29 were the only ones hospitalized -- one with a punctured lung -- due to this particular tornado, the National Weather Service said. The agency reported the twister had winds between 111 and 135 mph as it caused a half-mile long damage path over 10 miles. Across the south and central Plains, storm chasers broadcast images of funnel clouds roaring through rural landscapes. One of the biggest cities hit Saturday and early Sunday was Wichita, Kansas, where resident Katie Sykes said torrential rains produced a ""river in my front yard"" and the prospect of a tornado had her shuddering in fear. ""When I was little we prepared for storms, hearing the sirens and then going to the basement. And going through this experience I felt like a little kid, young and scared,"" the CNN iReporters said. In the basement of her downtown home, 30-year-old Lacy Jay Hansen and her family donned bicycle helmets and crouched against a corner as a suspected tornado churned its way toward her home. ""It turned right in the nick of time for us, striking this other neighborhood,"" she said, later learning the storm destroyed a friend's house several miles away. Eleven months ago, Hansen, her husband and son were in Joplin, Missouri, visiting their ailing grandfather in a hospital when a tornado ripped through, killing 158 people. ""None of us were supposed to be there,"" she said. ""We've always taken it seriously. But ever since then, we take it more seriously."" The tornado that tore through Joplin was one of 1,691 tornadoes that killed a total of 550 people in 2011, according to the National Weather Service. Last year was the fourth deadliest tornado year in U.S. history. The tragedy in Joplin triggered stronger warnings by the weather service about life-threatening storms. More than 24 hours before the storms began rolling across the Midwest on Saturday, the service was cautioning residents of the storm's potential damage. At the Marriott in downtown Wichita, Johnny Williams watched over eight children -- in town for a basketball camp -- in a ballroom where they'd taken shelter. ""We play together as a team, and we believe together as a team,"" Williams said. The storm caused flooding in parts of downtown Wichita, and McConnell Air Force Base also sustained damage, authorities said. A suspected tornado tossed baggage carts across runways at the Wichita Mid-Continent Airport but didn't cause any structural damage, Sedgwick County spokeswoman Kristi Zuckovich said. A few hundred employees were working at a Spirit Aero Systems plant, producing fuselages and other equipment for Boeing aircraft, said company spokesman Ken Evans, when a twister came through and caused the roof to collapse. No one was injured, and workers have been told not to come in until Wednesday as the damage is assessed, added Evans. Damage was also reported to a Hawker Beechcraft building, which manufactures high-performance business jets and turbo-prop planes. Country singer Miranda Lambert's concert Saturday night at the Intrust Bank arena in Wichita was interrupted by an apparent tornado. She was taken off the stage and fans were kept inside, said Lt. Jason Gill of the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office. Later, Lambert tweeted, ""We made it y'all. Thanks for coming out and for making it through the delay with a smile."" The storm destroyed six mobile homes in Wichita County, officials said, but didn't cause any known fatalities in the area. Earlier, a confirmed tornado struck a hospital in Creston, Iowa, blowing out windows and damaging the roof, said John Benson of the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency. There were no major injuries reported, and patients were relocated to other area hospitals. CNN's Susan Candiotti reported from Kansas and Rob Marciano reported from Oklahoma and Kansas. CNN's Josh Levs, Chelsea Carter, Randi Kaye and Maria P. White reported from Atlanta.","10 tornadoes are reported Sunday, including three in Minnesota .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes scored as Manchester United beat 10-man Queens Park Rangers 2-0 Sunday to strengthen their grip on the English Premier League title with six matches to play. Victory left the defending champions eight points clear of local rivals Manchester City, who were beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in the late kickoff. Arsenal's Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta beat England goalkeeper Joe Hart with a superb shot three minutes from time to all but end City's hopes of a first league title since 1968. Second-placed City's misery was complete when striker Mario Balotelli was sent off just before the final whistle for a second yellow card. Manager Roberto Mancini had told Sky Sports that with United winning at home to QPR his side had to win to stay in the championship race. ""Today for us is like a final, otherwise eight points is too much,"" he told Sky Sports. Interviewed after the defeat, Mancini admitted that with the points gap ""it's very difficult but we will do our best."" He was also angered by Balotelli, who was lucky to stay on the pitch after a first-half tackle on Alex Song before being booked after tangling with Bacary Sagna. ""The first tackle was bad,"" said Mancini. ""I defend Mario because he is a good guy but if he doesn't change in the future he could waste his talent. He can't continue to play like this."" Arsenal's deserved win after a game they dominated took them two points clear of north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the battle for third spot. Earlier, United continued their recent superb run against strugglers QPR after being given the benefit of a dubious early decision. The visitors were immediately on the back foot when Shaun Derry was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Ashley Young in conceding a penalty. It looked a marginal decision with television replays indicating Young was offside, but Rooney thumped home the penalty for his 30th goal of the season and his 12th in 12 matches. QPR boss Mark Hughes said the club would be appealing the decision -- the second in recent matches to favor United after Fulham's Danny Murphy was denied a clear penalty in his team's 1-0 defeat last month. ""These are massive decisions that affect people's livelihoods. Decisions are not being correctly made and they are affecting too many people,"" the former United striker told reporters. ""The referee was too quick to put his whistle to his mouth. The kid was still rolling around and he had already given a penalty. His assistant didn't have the opportunity to put his flag up."" United took control and in the second half the veteran Scholes duly grabbed his third goal since coming out of retirement as United made it 11 wins in 12 EPL matches. QPR remained just above the relegation zone albeit on goal difference alone after the defeat.","Manchester United go eight points clear in English Premier League on Sunday .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- North Korea's leader spoke before hundreds of North Korean troops and others in Pyongyang on Sunday as part of a massive, orchestrated celebration marking 100 years since the birth of the nation's founder, Kim Il Sung. Deemed the Eternal President, Kim was born on August 15, 1912. Some 33 years later, following North Korea's liberation from Japan, he pledged in Pyongyang to build a nation on wealth, strength and knowledge. His grandson, Kim Jong Un, is now North Korea's ""supreme commander"" -- a title he has recently assumed, following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. Elaborate and extensive 100th anniversary celebrations of Kim Il Sung's birth have been in the works for years. One of those milestones was the Friday launch of a long-range rocket -- a move deplored by the United States and many others in the international community, even after it prematurely broke apart and failed to escape the Earth's atmosphere. On Sunday, state TV showed video of large blocks of North Korean troops as they marched in tight formation. Music was interspersed at times by coordinated chants, while military officials could be seen saluting from vehicles that drove past tanks lined up in the square. Kim Jong Un himself addressed the crowd -- his first televised speech since becoming the North Korean leader -- offering remarks that regularly stirred applause from onlookers. He touched on a number of issues, including touting the significance of North Korea's military and vowing never to let the country's citizens go hungry again. Much of Kim's roughly 20-minute talk focused on the importance of the revolution spearheaded by his grandfather, saying that it was the North Korean government's responsibility to work to realize the movement's aspirations and live up to its values.","NEW: Kim Jong Un touts the importance of the revolution begun by his grandfather .

"TAMARAC, Florida (CNN) -- ""Schlep."" A senior discusses Sen. Barack Obama with organizers of the Great Schelp in Tamarac, Florida, on Sunday. A Yiddish word meaning to pull, yank or tug, schlep is a good way of describing what it took for Mike Bender to persuade his grandparents to vote for Sen. Barack Obama for president. Bender's grandparents, Kenny and Selma Furst, 90 and 87 years old, should have been an easy sell to support the Democratic nominee for president. Like many of the estimated 650,000 Jews living in Florida, the Fursts are lifelong, passionate Democrats and a crucial vote for any Democratic candidate hoping to win the battleground state. But when Bender -- who is not affiliated with Obama's campaign but supports him -- brought up the idea of voting for Obama over Thanksgiving dinner last year, he was met with an uncharacteristic silence. ""Their reaction was, as they said, 'I'm a little meschugah,' "" Bender said, adding that the expression meant ""crazy."" For Selma Furst, voting for an African-American for president seemed unthinkable.  Watch a ""few little known Jewish facts"" on Obama » . ""I grew up with Jewish people and Italian people, but I never lived in a neighborhood that was black,"" she said. ""Somebody said to me, 'What do you object to about him?' I said, well, truthfully, our colors are different."" Overcoming the prejudices of his grandparents' generation would be difficult, Bender realized. But he was not going to be alone. Ari Wallach, co-executive director of Jews Vote, a Jewish advocacy group, also said he saw reluctance among some older, traditionally Democratic Jews to support Obama. But Wallach said it wasn't just a question of race. He cited a months-long misleading Internet campaign that aimed to convince voters that Obama is a Muslim or that he would reverse the United States' policy of supporting Israel. Obama is Christian and says he backs a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. ""The older demographic particularly were being hit with tons and tons of Obama smear e-mails,"" Wallach said. ""If you really want to talk to them in a way that will bring them over to the Obama side, you want to do it one to one, ideally with people they love. And grandparents love no one more than their grandkids."" And so the Great Schlep was born. The idea was that young, Jewish Democrats would flood Florida and convince their elders that voting for Obama was OK. To get the word out about the Great Schlep, Wallach and his colleagues turned to comedian Sarah Silverman. Silverman makes the case for Obama in a Web video in which she attempts to show similarities -- some tenuous -- between an African-American man and an older Jewish woman. She raves about the Democratic candidate's brisket and points out that Barack comes from the Hebrew word for ""lightning.""  Watch the Great Schlep » . The video ends with Silverman advising Obama supporters to let their grandparents know that should they fail to vote Democratic in the presidential election in November, maybe they shouldn't expect many more family visits. The Silverman video quickly became a Web sensation, garnering about 2 million hits in the two weeks since it was posted on thegreatschlep.com, organizers said. Thousands of people pledged to call their relatives in Florida and more than 100 people volunteered to pay their own way to travel to the Sunshine State to campaign for Obama among Jewish voters, Wallach said. Bender saw the Silverman video on YouTube in Los Angeles, California, where he works as a writer. Despite the humor of Silverman's call to schlep, the video's message resonated with Bender because of the difficulty he faced convincing his own grandparents. ""I thought it was brilliant,"" Bender said. He decided to go to Florida and try one more time. When Bender recently returned to his grandparents' retirement community in Tamarac, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale, he was greeted with several surprises. Months of telephone conversations and his trip had paid off: His grandparents told him shortly after he arrived that they were going to support Obama. The next surprise was that his schlep had generated interest around their retirement community. A lot of interest. So many other seniors wanted to hear about Obama that the venue for a meeting on the subject had to be changed from the Furst's living room to a ballroom in the community's clubhouse. An hour before Bender started to make his case about Obama on Sunday, groups of senior citizens were staking out space in the ballroom. Soon there were more than 100 people and no more chairs. Sporting an Obama T-shirt with Hebrew writing on it, retiree Morty Brill said, ""The economy, the war, you think you can trust Republicans to fix them?"" If there were any people in the room with reservations about Barack Obama, they kept those doubts to themselves. As Bender told the crowd that Obama was not a Muslim and that Obama was a staunch supporter of Israel, he was met with heads nodding in agreement throughout the room. However, Bender felt the need to drive the point further. If Obama was elected, he said, then Bender would not worry so much about politics and ""would have more time to find a nice Jewish girl to marry."" Whether Mike Bender's schlep really changed any minds is anyone's guess, but the applause from the crowd was deafening.","The Great Schlep has Jewish Democrats pitching Barack Obama to elders in Florida .

"Cartagena, Colombia (CNN) -- Regional summits are most often perfunctory events where presidents share their visions, sign agreements and pose for photographs. At the sixth Summit of the Americas, some Latin American leaders hope to sway -- or at least challenge -- the priorities of the hemisphere's largest power, the United States. The leaders of some Latin American countries are expected to challenge the conventional wisdom that the way to deal with illegal drug trafficking is with firepower. Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina and others are offering serious alternatives, such as legalization. ""My position is -- let's discuss it,"" said Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who is hosting the event. ""We must ask each other, are we doing the best we can? Sometimes the answer is no. The consumption is going up in many countries."" Santos said that Latin America wants to pull Washington's attention toward the region. The United States needs to realize that its long-term interests are not in places like Afghanistan, but in Latin America, Santos said. ""What I hope that can come out of this summit is that the U.S., but not only the U.S. government, the U.S. businessman, the U.S. public opinion, starts to look at Latin America with different eyes, as an opportunity, not as an area full of problems."" Presidents from the Western Hemisphere arrived Friday in the coastal Colombian city of Cartagena, ahead of several days of discussions on such topics. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's attendance remained uncertain Friday night, when he told Venezuelan National Television, ""In reality, that won't be decided by me, but by the doctors."" Chavez said he would return Saturday to Havana for more cancer treatment. But he said a Venezuelan presence was required in Colombia to answer ""American imperialism"" and protest Cuba's exclusion from the summit, adding that Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro might represent Venezuela in his place. Santos recommended the United States seek closer relations with Havana. ""I think that, by embracing Cuba, one would be in a better position to press for reforms and more democracy and more freedom in Cuba,"" the Colombian president said. Asked whether he was going to press Obama on that issue, he said, ""It's a very sensitive issue in states like Florida. I understand his reluctance to discuss this at this moment."" While the balance of power between the United States and the rest of the hemisphere will be a certain talking point, Santos also laid out an agenda for Latin American countries to tackle among themselves. They include fighting poverty, improving access to energy, building infrastructure, preparing to better respond to natural disasters and increasing access to technology. ""What I would prefer more besides this is a new way of talking to each other, more as partners, more as equals, and more conscious of the need that we have of each other,"" he told a reporter. There is no dogma or specific type of government that can ensure development, Santos said. It takes a moderate approach in the mold of leaders such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair or former American President Bill Clinton who governed from the middle, he said. Some recent Latin American leaders, such as Ricardo Lagos of Chile and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, advanced their nations by also following the centrist, so-called Third Way. ""If we play our cards right, with a long-term vision, and thinking big, being ambitious, we can finally say ... that the future is here,"" Santos said. U.S. President Barack Obama arrived Friday. On a quick visit to Tampa ahead of his flight to Cartagena, Obama spoke with small-business owners about his own agenda. ""In Latin America alone in the last decade, tens of millions of people have stepped into the middle class,"" he said. ""That means they have more money to spend, we want them to spend more money on American-made goods."" ""While I am in Colombia talking to other leaders, I am going to think about you,"" Obama added. ""I want to sell our stuff and put Americans back to work."" The goal of the summit is to ""unite against the ills of the 21st century. Like poverty, terrorism and global warming,"" Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said. ""And also, to unite to achieve the great goal that America has to conquer -- and it is the responsibility of our generation -- to make America a developed continent without poverty, with opportunity for all."" More than 7,600 police officers and thousands more troops were expected in the walled colonial city as part of stepped-up security for the summit, which started Monday with a youth conference. The summit has brought a different vibe to the tourist destination. The number of tourists has dropped tremendously this week, locals said. Tourism has fallen by ""90%,"" street vendor Alcides Escobar said. ""Who we have here is just people from the summit and their security."" CNN's Patrick Oppmann and John Helton contributed to this report.","Western Hemisphere leaders arriving at Cartagena, Colombia, for sixth Summit of the Americas .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- South Africa's ruling party banned its controversial youth leader Julius Malema from taking part in any party activities Wednesday, after he gave a speech that was critical of President Jacob Zuma. Malema's suspension from the African National Congress (ANC) comes into immediate effect, the party's national disciplinary committee said in a statement. Malema had already been suspended from membership of the party in November but was still allowed to attend party meetings while the appeals process was in progress. Malema's appeal against the disciplinary committee's ruling will be heard on April 12. The latest sanction from the disciplinary panel follows a speech Malema made Friday in which he suggested that Zuma was running the party in a dictatorial and intolerant way. ""It is under President Zuma that we have seen the youth of the ANC being traumatized, being expelled from their own home,"" Malema said, according to the ANC statement. ""It is under President Zuma we have seen a critical voice being suppressed. We have seen under President Zuma, democracy being replaced with dictatorship."" The disciplinary panel said the youth leader's remarks constituted ""a very serious violation"" of the party's constitution. Malema attracts wide popular support and his suspension may cause anger among his base. He and the youth league helped propel Zuma to power in 2009, but have more recently become his fiercest critics, accusing his administration of failing to improve the lives of the poor. The party is due to elect a new leader in December this year, who will likely lead the party into national elections in 2014. Malema has previously been mentioned as a potential contender for the role. Malema was suspended for five years after the disciplinary hearing last November but was allowed to appeal. He faced a string of charges, including sowing party divisions by comparing Zuma to his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, and bringing the party into disrepute by urging the toppling of the Botswana government. In July, Malema criticized South Africa's decision to vote for a no-fly zone over Libya and accused the government of failing to prioritize the African agenda. ""In the past, we know President Mbeki used to represent that agenda very well,"" Malema was quoted as saying at the time. Malema's supporters considered the disciplinary action an attempt to silence the anti-Zuma voice within the ruling party. Malema has also been the subject of a criminal investigation by the national revenue service over allegations he used his political position to influence the awarding of government tenders. CNN's Nima Elbagir, Bharati Naik and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","The sanction comes after Julius Malema made a speech critical of President Zuma .

"(Wired) -- High-tech sensors are everywhere. They alert us to spoiled food. They monitor our stress levels. And they're blowing up in the health and fitness space, too, helping us track our key sleep and activity metrics. And now we have the Philips ErgoSensor Monitor, a desktop display that keeps an eye on one's posture. The 24-inch LCD monitor uses a built-in CMOS sensor to determine your distance from the screen and your neck angle while sitting. The monitor works with software made by DigitalOptics Corporation, and, like a worried mother, will remind you to straighten your back, keep your distance from the display, and take breaks from sitting at the computer. According to Philips, the sensor measures your inter-pupillary distance -- the distance two pupils -- to determine whether you're sitting at an optimal distance from the monitor. The system can also sense if your neck is inclined at a poor ergonomic angle, and will give you corrective feedback showing you the ideal angle position. And if you've been sitting for too long, the built-in software will remind you to get up to take a break. We haven't seen a Philips ErgoSensor monitor in action yet, but if it does what it says, it could be valuable for consumers wanting a more ergonomic workstation. ""It's an interesting concept and it certainly provides a potential value for timing and alerting people to take a break,"" David Rempel, Director of the Ergonomics Program at UC Berkeley and Professor of Medicine at UCSF, told Wired. ""It may have value in terms of posture depending on how it measures neck angle and distance from the screen."" The design of the monitor itself is also ergonomically friendly. Philips dubs the base ""The SmartErgoBase"" as it can be lowered to almost desk level, and allows users to tilt, rotate, swivel, and make angle adjustments to the screen. This is an important feature to include in the monitor, Rempel says: ""We know that if a monitor is set too high or too low, and a person has to work with their head in extension, it can lead to neck pain."" Rempel advises people to set their monitors so that it is at a 10- to 20-degree angle below the horizon of their eyes. The eco-concsious can rest easy with this monitor, too. When you walk away from the screen, it will automatically detect that you're no longer present and power itself down. The device is also made out of 65% recycled plastics, and comes with a 0-watt hard switch that lets you cut power completely off from the monitor for zero power consumption. The monitor is available in the EU for 285 euros (about $375). The company has not yet released a launch date or price for the United States. See the original article on WIRED .

After planning for this journey to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary for the better part of three years, they want to be prepared. It is, after all, the trip of a lifetime. On Sunday, the retired couple from Marietta, Georgia, will set sail from Southampton, England, along with more than 1,300 other passengers on a cruise to mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. ""I think it will be fascinating. I get chills just thinking about it,"" Sheila Byron says. Perhaps that's with good reason. The Titanic Memorial Cruise will follow the route the Titanic took, and is scheduled to be in the exact spot at the exact time the Titanic struck an iceberg close to midnight on April 14, 1912, sending it to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean a little less than three hours later. More than 1,500 people lost their lives, and about 700 -- mostly women and children -- survived. For Titanic enthusiasts like the Byrons, marking the tragedy where it happened is part of the appeal. ""There is a little bit of excitement and a little bit of trepidation to be on the ship outside at night with the chaplain conducting a Christian ceremony to honor the deceased that came from all walks of life,"" Tom Byron says. ""To be out there and know that 100 years ago, they were not doing what we will be doing; that they were wondering how much longer they had left to live ... it's overwhelming actually."" While not everyone would go to these lengths to mark a historic disaster, it's human nature to be interested. ""Some people may say the curiosity is ghoulish and macabre, but this is really just an ordinary reaction to extraordinary events,"" says Jerry Jacobs, a psychology professor and director of the Disaster Mental Health Institute at the University of South Dakota. ""It's a fairly universal interest that human beings have to try to see someone going through what we might experience ourselves,"" Jacobs says. It's why people slow down when they drive past an accident, he adds. But it isn't just the tragic nature of the Titanic that captivates the Byrons. The mystique of a lost era also fascinates them. The cruise, organized by a British travel agency and sailing on the liner MS Balmoral, will feature history lectures; a stop at Cobh, Ireland, the Titanic's last port of call; and a stop in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where many of the victims were buried. ""The dining rooms are going to follow the etiquette that was used during the Gilded Age. And on the night of the 14th a lot of people will be in period costumes,"" Sheila Byron says. ""The people on the ship represented a lifestyle that disappeared when the ship sank,"" Tom Byron says. ""It was the end of the Gilded Age -- the Edwardian period where the rich people got off the ship, mostly, and the third class of people mostly perished."" Sheila Byron has been interested in the Titanic since she was a child. And she's far from the only one. The facts surrounding the ill-fated maiden voyage permeate popular culture. The disaster has spawned countless books, television specials and movies -- perhaps none more famous than James Cameron's Oscar-winning film ""Titanic,"" one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. To coincide with the anniversary the epic film is being re-released in 3-D in theaters on Friday. In Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the White Star Line's most infamous ship was built, a new museum opened last month complete with interactive, hands-on exhibits, adding to a growing list of museums dedicated to the disaster, including one in Southampton, the point from which the ship set sail. And there are sister Titanic attractions in Branson, Missouri, and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, catering to the fascination of American audiences. What is it that makes the Titanic so intriguing and universal to so many people? ""I think it's the fact that it was called unsinkable; that no one thought this was going to happen. A lot of the people on the boat still didn't think it was going to happen when they were sitting in a lifeboat waiting to be rescued,"" Sheila Byron says. Jacobs agrees. Heavy publicity as the ship was built helped cement the mythology. ""There was tremendous wealth and glamor on this 'unsinkable' ship,"" he says. ""But you don't have to win the lottery to be happy, and you don't escape terrible things in life just because you are wealthy, and that's characterized in the fascination of the Titanic."" The Byrons know some people think they're crazy for what could be looked at as tempting fate. ""When you say you are going on a cruise, the first thing people ask is 'where'? And then I go, 'oh dear, here we go again,'"" Sheila Byron says. ""A lot of them say 'Our prayers will be with you,' or 'Have a good time.' But not too many of them say they would do it."" The thought of disaster is there, Tom Byron says, but it's not dampening the couple's enthusiasm. ""It's one last look at my 50-item checklist that I've looked at for weeks and weeks and weeks,"" he says smiling. ""It's all organized. It's time to go. Let's go.""

"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Solferino which led to the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC is using the date to launch an awareness campaign of its work in conflict-affected countries, featuring photos taken by five award-winning photojournalists. This week we're bringing you stories from some of the world's most troubled countries, as told by the ICRC. CITÉ SOLEIL, Haiti (ICRC) -- Roudeline Lamy was 23 when she was shot in the stomach. The impact of the bullet sent the small baby she was holding tumbling to the ground. Roudeline Lamy shows the scar from her bullet wound. At 26, she's a widow after losing her husband to gangland violence. Roudeline still suffers from stomach pains and her daughter, now three years old, is paralyzed from the waist down. The mother and child sleep on the concrete floor of a shack that floods every time it rains. Since Roudeline's husband was killed by the gangs, she has had to rely on the charity of friends and her faith that God will not abandon her. With very few State services, God is all the poor in Haiti's sprawling seaside slum of Cité Soleil can believe in. Two schools and one state hospital serve the ever-expanding population, with aid agencies and religious groups trying to plug the gap. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been in Haiti since 1994 and in Cité Soleil since 2003. Rob Drouen, head of the ICRC delegation, explains, ""Haiti is a fragile state where armed gangs can be used to stir up trouble for political reasons and abject poverty fuels discontent.""   See photos taken by award-winning photojournalist Ron Haviv » . Even among the children. In Cité Soleil, a dozen street children start pummeling a young girl. It's not known why. But within seconds word has spread that a fight is on. Hordes of children with matted hair and ragged clothes race to the scene, glad of anything to relieve the monotony of yet another day with nothing to do. Weary parents pull their children away, leaving the shaken girl to escape. This is a far cry from the days when families ran for cover from daily gun battles. A few years ago, Cité Soleil was one of the most dangerous and destitute places on earth -- a shanty town torn apart by a vicious gang war for control of the area. United Nations troops have stabilized the security situation in Haiti, the western world's poorest country, and many gang members are either dead or behind bars. Nevertheless, violence still surrounds the 300,000 residents of Cité Soleil, fueled by hunger and the frustration of trying to survive on less than a dollar a day. I sidestep the brawling children and enter the home of a woman who has suffered more than most. A long-standing resident of Cité Soleil, 83 year old Elevanise Tidor was first caught in gangland crossfire in 1993. In 2004 she stepped into harm's away again when she was shot in the breast and stomach. As she undoes her faded dress to show the scars from her mastectomy, she tells me she was later hit by a car and now can hardly walk.  Watch Elevanise Tidor tell her story » . Confined to a sparsely furnished corrugated iron shack, she worries about how her children and grandchildren are going to make ends meet. ""My body took the bullets, but my family has been hit the hardest,"" she says. ""I can't work or do anything for them. My grandchildren often go to bed crying with hunger."" That the victims of violence can suffer for years after the event is well-known, but in Cité Soleil the suffering can last a lifetime. With the help of the ICRC, a group of victims of the violence is aiding fellow sufferers. In 2007, Pierre Wilber founded REVICIS (Regroupement des victimes de Cité Soleil) after gang members beat him up for political reasons. REVICIS has already identified 300 victims and is now trying to get funds for social, psychological and legal help. ""There are so many social problems in Cité Soleil that everyone here is a victim,"" he says. ""But we give priority to people visibly scarred by violence, because they have suffered a double blow."" Brice Osmer is one of the rare victims who can still work. In April 2005, he was caught in a shoot-out between UN troops and gang members. He was hit three times and lost an arm. Since then he walks the streets selling mobile phone time cards and bags of water. ""On a good day I earn a dollar, but it's thanks to my wife who sells food from dawn to dusk that my children don't starve."" In 2004, at the height of the gang warfare, the Red Cross ensured that people had safe access to water. Previously, they had been risking their lives crossing frontlines to fill up their buckets. Today, the ICRC works with the water board, maintaining and running 53 communal water points across Cité Soleil, turning them on for a couple of hours 20 days a month. Prospere Borgelin works with the ICRC on its water project. He also works with other international organizations to improve living conditions in Ti-Haiti where he lives (Ti-Haiti is Creole for Petit Haiti, or Little Haiti.) Like other community leaders, he has seen the benefits of working closely with the humanitarian agencies and with the Brazilian troops from the U.N. stabilization mission responsible for security in Cité Soleil. ""The troops have brought security. Communities are beginning to organize themselves. We see the results in that roads are being built, rubbish collected and sewage removed,"" he says. At considerable personal risk, Borgelin has helped the U.N. and the Haitian police arrest gang members in his neighborhood and continues to be vigilant. Like many in Cité Soleil, he fears that the U.N. will pull out before the Haitian police are ready to take over and that the streets will again echo to the sound of gunfire. ""Misery,"" he says, ""breeds violence. And there's still plenty of misery in Cité Soleil."" For more about this topic go to the ICRC Website. Have you been affected by conflict?

"(CNN) -- Recovery crews in southern New Mexico were working to reach a child's body at the bottom of a 30-foot-deep hole Sunday. Authorities believe the child is Samuel Jones, who went missing Saturday, Carlsbad Police Department spokeswoman Lt. Jennifer Moyers said in a statement. Officials think the child died when he fell into the hole in his neighbor's yard, CNN affiliate KOAT reported. ""We initially began with rescue procedures. Unfortunately, it was discovered that the conditions inside the hole were not survivable, the amount of oxygen that was there, the temperature, that type of thing,"" Carlsbad Police Chief Daniel Fierro told CNN affiliate KRQE. A detective searching for the 4-year-old Sunday morning spotted the body when he shined a light into the neighbor's well, KOAT reported. It could take a day for mining crews to reach the body safely, state police said. ""It breaks my heart, that little boy down there,"" heavy equipment operator Paul Kartscner told KOAT. Crews were digging a trench from the side of the hole and shoring up the sides, KOAT said. Investigators, who said Saturday that they feared the boy had been abducted by a stranger, said Sunday that they were treating the case as a homicide until they determine a cause of death, KRQE reported.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich may be leading Germany's bid for success on European football's main stage, but Borussia Dortmund rule the roost domestically after winning the Bundesliga title for the second successive season on Saturday. Champions League semifinalists Bayern made sure their rivals would have to get a result in the late kickoff by snatching a last-gasp 2-1 win at Werder Bremen, but Dortmund retained the crown with two matches to spare in front of their home crowd after a 2-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach. It put Jurgen Klopp's team eight points clear of Bayern, who go to Spain on Wednesday holding a 2-1 advantage over Real Madrid with the added incentive of a final at Munich's Allianz Arena on May 19. Dortmund failed to make it past the group stages of Europe's top club competition this season, but have won 23 of 32 matches in the German league and will face Bayern in the final of the German Cup on May 12. Croatia midfelder Ivan Perisic opened the scoring in the 23rd minute with a header from Marcel Schmelzer's free-kick, while Japan international Shinji Kagawa settled any nerves of the 80,720 sellout home crowd at Signal Iduna Park with the second goal on the hour mark to seal the club's eighth title since forming in 1909. Dortmund fans also cheered the return of 19-year-old Germany international Mario Gotze, who made his comeback as a substitute in the final 15 minutes having been sidelined by injury since mid-December. The victory extended Dortmund's unbeaten league run to 26 matches, and ended Bayern's slim hopes of a first title since 2010 and 23rd overall. Jupp Heynckes' team needed a stoppage-time goal from Franck Ribery, who followed up his opener against Real last Tuesday by dealing a major blow to eighth-placed Werder Bremen's hopes of Europa League football next season. Brazil defender Naldo put the home side ahead in the 51st minute, but diverted a cross by substitute Ribery into his own net with quarter of an hour to play. Ribery had been rested along with Arjen Robben -- who the France international reportedly fought with during the halftime break against Real and was fined, according to German reports. But Ribery struck in the final seconds to put Bayern 10 points clear of third-placed Schalke, who travel to fourth-bottom Augsburg on Sunday. Monchengladbach stayed a point behind Schalke, and facing an uphill battle to qualify for the Champions League. Stuttgart drew 1-1 at third-bottom Cologne and stayed in fifth ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, who won 1-0 at Hoffenheim. Second-bottom Hertha Berlin's hopes of staying in the top flight suffered a big blow after a 2-1 home defeat by already-relegated Kaiserslautern.","Borussia Dortmund clinch second successive German league title on Saturday .

"Busan, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean court on Thursday sentenced the captain of a Chinese fishing boat to 30 years in prison for murdering a South Korean coast guard officer during a confrontation in the Yellow Sea last year. The court in the port of Incheon also handed down prison terms to several other crew members of the Chinese vessel, which the South Korean coast guard officials boarded on December 12 because they suspected it of fishing illegally. The skipper of the fishing boat, Cheng Dawei, was convicted of stabbing the coast guard officer, Lee Cheng-ho, several times with a knife. Lee later died of his injuries and another coast guard official was wounded in the encounter. Prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Cheng, 43, but the court chose to give him a lengthy prison term and a fine of 20 million won, or about $17,500. Nine other Chinese sailors received sentences of one and a half to five years for their roles in the clash, according to Judge Rho Jong-chan, a spokesman for the court. Liu Weimin, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Thursday that China and South Korea had not agreed upon the demarcation of exclusive economic zones in the Yellow Sea. As a result, he said, China ""does not accept"" South Korea's application of its law to reach ""such a verdict."" Speaking at a regular news conference, Liu said China would continue to follow the case closely and ""provide necessary assistance to the Chinese citizens concerned to protect their legitimate rights and interests."" At the time of the confrontation, Seoul asked Beijing to ""strictly clamp down on illegal fishing and the illegal acts of Chinese fishermen."" The Yellow Sea, which contains important fishing and crab grounds, has been a point of contention for several Asian countries, most notably North and South Korea who have long disagreed on whose waters end where. The South Korean coast guard stopped hundreds of Chinese boats last year on suspicion of illegal fishing in the sea. Disputes over fishing rights have resulted in dozens of boat seizures. CNN's Chi-Chi Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: China says it doesn't accept South Korea applying its law in this area .

"(CNN) -- The race for England's last two European Champions League places took another twist on Saturday as Newcastle's sixth successive victory left London's three leading clubs battling for qualification. Arsenal remained third in the Premier League after drawing 0-0 with sixth-placed Chelsea, but now have just a three-point advantage over Newcastle -- who have a game in hand. Tottenham are a further three points back, one ahead of Chelsea, after crashing 1-0 in a London derby at 10-man Queens Park Rangers -- who moved three clear of the relegation zone. Newcastle had trailed Spurs by 11 points after a 5-0 thrashing in London in February, but Alan Pardew's team are now hoping to qualify for Europe's top club competition for the first time since the 2003-04 season. However, the Magpies face a difficult run-in against in-form relegation battlers Wigan, Chelsea, second-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Everton. On Saturday Newcastle cruised to a 3-0 win over Stoke as midfielder Yohan Cabaye scored twice and also set up striker Papisse Cisse's 11th goal in 10 league games since signing from Hoffenheim in January. Tottenham could have joined Newcastle on 62 points, but have now won just three times in 13 matches in all competitions since that February clash. Adel Taarabt curled in the only goal with a free-kick against his former club, but QPR's Morocco midfielder was sent off late in the match for a second booking after kicking the ball away. Harry Redknapp's Spurs next face two more teams battling to avoid relegation, Blackburn and Bolton, before playing Aston Villa and Fulham. The manager was the favorite to take over the England role earlier this season, but his hopes of replacing Fabio Capello appear to be dwindling after his injury-hit team's recent downturn. ""We have four games to go and I'm confident we can win four games. It is all to play for. We are fighting for our lives and fighting for Champions League football,"" Redknapp said. Arsenal's final three matches are against teams in the bottom half of the table -- Stoke, Norwich and West Brom -- but Chelsea's strong recent form will be tested by an arduous end to the season. It starts on Tuesday with the second leg of the Champions League semifinal away to Barcelona, then a home derby against QPR, the Newcastle game, two matches against Liverpool (the first of which being the FA Cup final) and finally a visit by Blackburn to Stamford Bridge. Interim manager Roberto Di Matteo made eight changes from the 1-0 win over Barca, with goalscorer Didier Drogba missing out due to a knee injury. ""We've had so many games, it was a crazy schedule -- it wasn't going to be possible to play the same players in every game,"" the Italian said. Third-bottom Blackburn have tested leaders Manchester United and Liverpool in recent weeks and kept alive hopes of staying up with a 2-0 win over Norwich on Saturday. Wigan could not follow up victories over United and Arsenal, losing 2-1 at Fulham after Philippe Senderos' late winner to be on 34 points alongside QPR. Bolton dropped to second from bottom despite snatching a 1-1 draw at home to 11th-placed Welsh club Swansea, who are assured of a second season in the top flight. Aston Villa could still go down after being held to a 0-0 draw at home by 10th-placed Sunderland, whose manager Martin O'Neill made a return to his former club. The result left Villa five points above the bottom three, but Bolton have a game in hand -- and have played two fewer matches than Wigan, Blackburn and QPR. Meanwhile, Manchester United will seek to move closer to a 20th league title on Sunday at home to Everton, while City -- five points adrift -- travel to bottom club Wolverhampton. Liverpool, in eighth, host West Brom.","Newcastle win sixth successive game to close gap on third-placed Arsenal .

"New York (CNN) -- Seven people, including three children, died Sunday when a vehicle flipped over a guardrail and plunged nearly 60 feet to the ground, landing upside down in an area of the Bronx Zoo that is closed to the public, officials said. The crash occurred near the Bronx River Parkway and East 180th Street. ""Police determined that a 2004 Honda Pilot traveling southbound on the Bronx River Parkway in the left lane had struck the center median, crossed over three southbound lanes and struck the curb, causing the vehicle to become airborne and continue over the guardrail and fall approximately 59 feet down into a wooded area inside of Bronx Zoo property,"" the New York Police Department said in a statement. Police identified the victims as driver Maria Gonzalez, 45; Jocelyn Gonzalez, 10; Maria Nunez, 39; Niely Rosario, 7; Marly Rosario, 3; Jacob Nunez, 85; and Ana Julia Martinez, 81. All were pronounced dead at the scene and an investigation is ongoing, police said. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said all the victims were wearing seat belts. He had previously given the older girls' ages as 15 and 5. Browne said the driver likely overcompensated when the left side of the SUV struck the barrier. The vehicle was traveling at a high speed, said FDNY Deputy Chief Ronald Werner. Zoo spokeswoman Mary Dixon said the vehicle landed just inside the southeast perimeter of the 265-acre zoo. A baby bag with diapers inside was found at the scene. ""It's far from any public area,"" Dixon said. ""No animals, exhibits or visitors were affected. ... It would be impossible for any visitors to see this."" The area where the vehicle fell is adjacent to where the zoo's trams are parked, Werner said. The fire department's Howard Sickles told reporters that in his 20 years he's ""seen a lot of horrific things and this is one of them."" The crushed vehicle came to rest in overgrown brush, Werner said. Authorities used thermal imaging cameras to find victims in case any had been ejected, he said. Authorities received multiple calls about the incident at about 12:30 p.m., Werner said. In 2006, six people died in an accident on the Bronx River Parkway near the site of Sunday's crash. CNN's Miguel Susana, Steve Kastenbaum, Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: The dead include three children, ages 10, 7 and 3, police say .

"(CNN) -- Manager Ozzie Guillen was back in the dugout Tuesday night after serving a five-game suspension imposed by the Miami Marlins for his comments praising former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and angering the city's sizable Cuban-American population. ""It's been a tough couple of days, you know what I mean?"" Guillen, in his first season as Marlins manager, told reporters before a game against the Chicago Cubs. ""I feel proud of the players and the coaching staff because they play well -- we wish they'd won a couple more games, but they ... went after their job very good, the way I thought they were gonna go about their business, and there's no one more excited than me to be back with them."" In an interview with Time magazine earlier this month, Guillen said, ""I love Fidel Castro,"" adding, ""You know why? A lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro for the last 60 years, but that (expletive) is still there."" After those comments, demonstrators rallied outside the Marlins' new $634 million stadium to denounce Guillen. The stadium is in the Little Havana section of the city, home to many who fled Cuba after Castro's 1959 communist revolution. Guillen incurs wrath of Cuban-Americans . Guillen apologized during a news conference April 10 -- first speaking in Spanish -- saying that he had ""betrayed a Latin community"" and that he was speaking ask for forgiveness with my heart in my hand."" Guillen's remarks came as his Marlins, who had often suffered from weak attendance despite winning two World Series, were seeking to burnish their brand. The club had moved into a new park in the heart of the city, changed its name (formerly the Florida Marlins), redesigned its uniforms and invested in some key offseason acquisitions. Among those moves was the hiring of Guillen, who in his previous managerial position with the Chicago White Sox had developed a reputation for building winning teams and, from time to time, making headlines with blunt remarks. In 2006, he apologized for making an anti-gay slur against a Chicago newspaper columnist, and in 2010 he said it was unfair that Japanese ballplayers got translators when Spanish-speaking players didn't. The Castro comment controversy appeared to have settled down Tuesday night as Guillen took his spot in the dugout for the game with the Cubs. If anyone was protesting in Marlins Park, it was not discernible over the gametime buzz of a pitching duel between Marlins ace Josh Johnson and the Cubs' Ryan Dempster.

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, formed Saturday off the coast of South Carolina. Forecasters predict fewer hurricanes this year . As of 5 p.m., the storm was located about 140 miles east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. It was churning southwest at 3 mph. No coastal watches or warning were in effect, though a tropical storm watch could be issued for parts of the coast later Saturday, the Hurricane Center said. Is there severe weather near you? Share your photos and videos on iReport (but stay safe) Despite being over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, Alberto is not expected to intensify much over the next couple of days. That is due, in part, to the presence of a cool and dry air mass to the north and west of the tropical storm, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. The forecast track shows Alberto moving slowly toward the south-southwest over the next day or so and then accelerating rapidly toward the northeast, away from the U.S. coast on Monday. This year marks the first time in recorded history that a tropical storm has formed in both the east Pacific basin and Atlantic basin before the official start of hurricane season, the Hurricane Center said. The Pacific storm was called Aletta. The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1.","NEW: It is not expected to intensify much over the next few days .

"(CNN) -- The showdown between the Vatican and America's largest group of Catholic nuns is expected to peak this week when group leaders will meet to determine a response to the Vatican's reprimand for the group's ""radical feminist themes."" The church also demands major reforms from the nuns' group. The Leadership Conference of Women Religious, initially surprised by the Vatican's report last month, ""plans to move slowly, not rushing to judgment"" when the group's 21-member board meets for three days in Washington, D.C., beginning Tuesday. ""The board will conduct its meeting in an atmosphere of prayer, contemplation and dialogue and will develop a plan to involve LCWR membership in similar processes,"" the group said in a statement. ""We will engage in dialogue where possible and be open to the movement of the Holy Spirit. We ask your prayer for us and for the Church in this critical time."" Last month, the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, the Catholic church's doctrinal watchdog, did a years-long ""doctrinal assessment"" investigation of the group -- which represents 80% of the Catholic nuns in United States -- and found ""serious doctrinal problems."" The Vatican accused the LCWR of sponsoring ""certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations."" The Vatican report, made public by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the doctrinal assessment began in part because of the group's dissent on the Holy See's teaching on the ordination of women and human sexuality. The Catholic Church ordains only men to be priests and says sex is to be between a man and woman who are married in the eyes of the church. While the assessment praised the social justice work of the group and other organizations such as Network and the Resources Center for Religious Life, it said the groups were ""silent on the right to life from conception to natural death, a question that is part of the lively public debate about abortion and euthanasia in the United States."" Simone Campbell, a nun who's executive director of Network, a national Catholic social justice lobby in Washington, said her ""hunch"" is that the LCWR will put together an outline response this week to be presented to the group's full assembly during its August meeting. ""I think the results for the media will be very anticlimactic because we as Catholic sisters do things with a lot of prayer and very slowly,"" Campbell about this week's meeting. ""It's going to be like watching paint dry,"" she added in a CNN interview. The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith appointed Archbishop Peter Sartain of Seattle to institute the reforms. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is providing support to Sartain, and the LCWR isn't expected to publicly address the Vatican report until after this week's meeting, said Mary Ann Walsh, spokeswoman for the bishops' conference. Nuns in various orders around the United States have been conversing about the Vatican report, and their reactions have been ""surprised, stunned, shocked,"" Campbell said. She said the report left her feeling ""as being suspect."" ""For myself, the shock made me numb at first, and then I was profoundly sad that my life as a woman religious and my commitment to serving the poor would be so denigrated by the leadership of our church,"" Campbell said. ""All we do is work for love."" For the report to say ""you don't do everything,"" Campbell said, is ""ridiculous."" ""They're saying we're silent on some issues. It's not our issue. Other people do those works,"" Campbell said. The report took note of public statements from the nuns that opposed the Catholic Bishops. The Leadership Conference of Women Religious and Network vocally disagreed with the Bishops' conference's position on the Affordable Care Act, which they supported and the Bishops did not. The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith called the current doctrinal and pastoral positions of the groups ""grave and a matter of serious concern,"" because of the global influence of the groups. Some observers of the church say the Leadership Conference may take a low-key position in its response and seek to defuse a confrontation. Others such as CNN's senior Vatican analyst John Allen said the Vatican report has basically decreed that the LCWR ""needs an overhaul in which it will have a tighter relationship with the bishops."" ""Basically, it needs to be more obedient,"" said Allen, who's also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, based in Kansas City, Missouri. The American nuns' group could do one of three options this week: it could go along with everything the Vatican is saying; it could offer to work and negotiate with the Vatican but say ""let's talk""; or it could say ""we're not going to play ball and we're going to walk away,"" Allen said. The last option would essentially mean ""we'll disband the LCWR and let it die on the vine and go off and do our own thing,"" Allen said. ""That's what on the table here: How do the nuns want to respond to the crackdown that they received from the Vatican,"" Allen added. He also noted how many of the group leaders are in their 60s and 70s. ""Some of them don't want to spend the last 10 years of their life engaged in negotiations with the Vatican,"" Allen said. ""Some of them just don't want to deal with this. This will be the first opportunity where we'll be able to take the temperature of the group on where the nuns stand on this. ""One way or another, it's an important crossroads moment,"" he added. For Campbell, the Vatican report doesn't pose a crisis of conscience. ""It's not affecting my conscience. It affects my sadness and heart. This life is profound and deep,"" Campbell said. ""When politics interferes, it doesn't change the depth of the spiritual. It's annoyance. It's not an issue of conscience. We're faithful."" Campbell belongs to the Sisters of Social Service, an order based in Encino, California, and the community is meeting for the feast of the Pentecost from Sunday to Tuesday. The congregation might put together a position statement for the LCWR's assembly meeting in August, Campbell said. ""We're open to the Holy Spirit and to let the group wisdom lead us, so I have no idea"" on whether on a position will be taken by the order, Campbell said. ""Stay tuned.""","Leaders of a group representing 80% of U.S. Catholic nuns will meet this week .

"(CNN) -- North Carolina is so important to the re-election chances of Barack Obama that he picked Charlotte as the host city for the Democratic nominating convention. On May 8, all his careful plans came crashing down when 61% of voters in a North Carolina referendum adopted a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Pre-election polls showed that a majority of Democratic voters supported this amendment, as did independents and an overwhelming majority of African-Americans and Republicans. Before the N.C. vote, Obama publicly opposed Amendment One, and gay activists used this in an attempt to rally Democrats and independents, and especially African-Americans, to oppose the measure. This failed miserably, and when polls started to predict Amendment One would pass, Obama canceled an Election Day trip to the state. Then Vice President Joe Biden popped off that he saw no problem with same-sex marriage. Finally, a day after the North Carolina vote, Obama admitted what had been obvious for a long time -- he supports redefining marriage. Obama's embrace of same-sex marriage will help ensure he becomes a one-term president, and his political demise will begin with North Carolina. Despite what many in the media claim, the American people do not support same-sex marriage. They sure as heck don't in North Carolina, where voters made it clear they want to prevent activist judges and politicians like Obama from redefining marriage. The National Organization for Marriage, which I head, helped lead the North Carolina campaign. Our victory for marriage was so impressive that the prominent Democratic Public Policy Polling firm sent out this Twitter missive as the results came in: ""Hate to say it, but I don't believe polls showing majority support for gay marriage nationally. Any time there's a vote, it doesn't back it up."" Support for traditional marriage in North Carolina and across the nation is heavily rooted in the faith traditions of voters. In 2008, candidate Obama acknowledged that as a Christian, ""God's in the mix"" when it comes to understanding the definition of marriage. Where is God now in his political calculation? It seems he's decided to ignore what the creator says about marriage and base his flip-flop on generalities about the ""Golden Rule."" Regardless, endorsing gay marriage isn't going to fly in North Carolina, and it isn't going to fly in any of the other swing states that have marriage amendments on the books -- including Ohio, Virginia, Florida, Colorado and Nevada -- all adopted by voters. Obama is now claiming that he supports the ""concept"" of states deciding the marriage issue themselves. His administration has agreed to enforce the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which is the legal framework that allows a state to control its own definition of marriage and avoid having to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. But the White House has refused to defend the law in federal court. If Obama gets his way and DOMA is overturned, it's only a matter of time before marriage is redefined for the entire country. Now he has signed up as an official cheerleader for that outcome. As if that wasn't enough, same-sex marriage radicals will descend on Charlotte and demand that the cause become a central plank of the Democratic Party platform. Nancy Pelosi is already enthusiastic about the prospect. The president has tied his presidency to a cause that has never been successful with voters -- not in a single state -- not at any time. Not in blue states such as California and certainly not in swing states such as North Carolina. What Obama has just succeeded in doing is to give an incredibly powerful reason to hundreds of thousands of social conservatives, and especially evangelicals, across America to rally behind Mitt Romney if they want to preserve marriage -- and they most decidedly do want to preserve marriage. The people of faith in America know that the future of marriage is on the line, and as has been proved in 32 votes across this nation, they will not fail the cause of marriage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Brown.","North Carolina voted to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Mali's new interim president vowed that he would not let the country be split by rebels as he was sworn in Thursday, restoring the country to civilian rule after a brief military coup. Dioncounda Traore, the former, speaker of the parliament, took the oath of office in the capital, Bamako, four days after President Amadou Toumani Toure handed in his letter of resignation to West African mediators. The inauguration was attended by junta leader Capt. Amadou Sanogo, who led the March 22 coup but agreed under international pressure to hand back power to a civilian government. In a speech, Traore, 70, called for talks with the separatist Tuareg rebels who capitalized on the post-coup disorder to capture large areas of Mali's vast Sahara region in the north. But failing that, government forces will wage a ""total and relentless war"" to retake the captured territory, he warned. The rebels have effectively split the West African nation in two, and northern areas remain volatile and tense, preventing aid agencies from accessing displaced people, the United Nations refugee agency said. The rebels last week declared independence for a region they recognize as Azawad, the cradle of their nomadic civilization. Calling for a return to peace, Traore urged all rebel movements ""to return to the negotiating table and to the ranks to strengthen this nation instead of dividing it. I ask them to stop the atrocities, the looting, the rapes. I ask them to leave peacefully, now, the cities they have been occupying."" Traore said that his mission was to unify the country and that no split would be tolerated. Foreign groups helping the rebels, such as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the sub-Saharan offshoot of the terror group, would also be driven out, he said. ""We do not negotiate the split of the country,"" he said. ""Mali will carry out this fight with the support of subregional countries, the whole of Africa, with the help and support of the European Union and the entire international community."" The March 22 coup staged by renegade soldiers led by Sanogo sparked a crisis in Mali, a West African nation that had been a cornerstone of stability. The international community -- including West African states, the African Union and the United States -- called for the immediate restoration of constitutional rule. Late last week, Sanogo reached a deal with the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, a regional group that promotes economic unity. The agreement mandated a handover of power to the civilian government in exchange for the end of trade and diplomatic sanctions. The African Union and ECOWAS had slapped the military junta in Bamako with travel and economic restrictions, and froze its assets. Journalist Amadou Timbine contributed to this report.","Former parliament Speaker Dioncounda Traore is sworn in as interim president of Mali .

"Rome (CNN) -- An Italian woman kidnapped in southern Algeria over a year ago has been freed, Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi said Tuesday. Terzi said he had just told the family of Maria Sandra Mariani of her release. ""I join in their great joy and relief for this wonderful news,"" he said in a written statement. ""My deepest gratitude goes to all of those who have contributed to the positive outcome with great dedication, constancy and professionalism."" Mariani, 54, was seized by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a sub-Saharan offshoot of the terrorism network, in the Algerian Sahara in February 2011, Italian news agency ANSA reported. Mariani, a tourist, was seized by armed men near the Niger border, the agency said. She is expected to return to Italy on Wednesday, Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. Her father, in Tuscany, wept with joy when he heard the news of her release, the newspaper said. The Italian government has not given details of how Mariani's freedom was secured. Another Italian, non-governmental organization worker Rossella Urru, was kidnapped last October by the same group and remains in their hands, the Italian foreign ministry said.

"(CNN) -- Within hours of the announcement that Levon Helm was in the final stages of cancer, fans flooded his Facebook page with messages of support and fond recollections of the drummer and backbone of The Band. By early Wednesday, more than 7,000 comments were posted. ""Truly one of our greatest musicians,"" said Kip Millwee. ""May he find his way absent of pain and in an ocean of peace."" ""We'll keep dancing to your beat,"" posted Joan Gummels. ""Thanks for all the good times."" ""When I had the privilege to feel your energy at the Harvest Jazz and Blues Festival ... You rocked my world,"" Courtney Anne Steeves said. ""Keep on shining."" Some fans shared memories from decades past. ""I was at Woodstock and heard you play!"" Sarah James recalled. ""It was so marvelous and a memory I will have till I leave this earth."" Helm's wife, Sandy, and daughter Amy posted a message to the artist's website regarding his condition on Tuesday. ""Please send your prayers and love to him as he makes his way through this part of his journey,"" his wife, Sandy, and daughter Amy wrote in a message posted to the artist's website. ""Thank you fans and music lovers who have made his life so filled with joy and celebration ... he has loved nothing more than to play, to fill the room up with music, lay down the back beat, and make the people dance! He did it every time he took the stage,"" they said. During an induction speech Saturday at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Helm's former bandmate Robbie Robertson offered his ""prayers and love"" for the drummer. Born in Elaine, Arkansas, in 1940, the son of a cotton farmer, Helm rose to fame in the late 1960s and 1970s as a member of The Band, a folk rock group. His soulful, drawling vocals highlighted many of the group's hit recordings, such as ""The Weight,"" ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"" and ""Up on Cripple Creek."" Helm, 71, was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998. He fell on hard times as cancer took his voice and medical bills threatened his house. ""You got to pick one -- pay your medical bills or pay the mortgage. Most people can't do both, and I'm not different,"" he told CNN in 2010. So The Barn, as the residence is known around Helm's adopted hometown of Woodstock, New York, became the setting for what he called a ""last celebration."" Not quite. Instead, The Barn became the center of an unlikely and unrivaled rock 'n' roll revival. It was there that Helm regularly hosted the Midnight Ramble, weekly concerts that attracted sell-out crowds and all-star support from the likes of Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson and Steely Dan's Donald Fagen. The result not only paid the bills but also led to a creative resurgence for Helm, with his collaborations producing back-to-back Grammy-winning albums: 2007's ""Dirt Farmer"" and 2009's ""Electric Dirt."" ""If I had my way about it, we'd probably do it every night,"" Helm said. ""I never get tired of it."" CNN's Dana Ford, John Branch and Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Fans flock to his Facebook page to share memories .

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- The sky is overcast, the wind is howling, and - like every day in Ireland - lashing rain could come at any moment. Yet Sam Hopkins is walking on a sunbeam. This summer, Hopkins will be working in London for a firm managing the 2012 Olympic summer games. The position is a major coup for the Dublin Business School student, largely because the prospects in Ireland are dim. ""It's quite limited,"" Hopkins explains. ""We're such a small country, we do have certain events, but they are on such a small scale compared to other countries."" Finding a job in Ireland, Hopkins says, can be a difficult task - especially for young adults. The Irish economy is in the toilet. Double digit unemployment, high government debt and a glut of unoccupied housing have silenced the roar of the Celtic Tiger, and left many of its cubs struggling to find employment. ""I've had a few interviews and things but it's really, really tough,"" says Dublin City University Masters Student Owlen Sheedy. ""There are an awful lot of masters students going for the jobs in Ireland at the moment, and it's very difficult for us with just degrees to get a job."" For those without degrees, the job search is even harder. According to the Irish government, a third of young men under 25 are unemployed, in large part because of the failing housing market. Many young carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers and electricians have left the island country for Canada or Australia, two countries where building is still a strong sector in the economy. Contractors in those countries have been quick to exploit the influx of young, semi-skilled workers. But Hopkins says the mass emigration of construction workers has made it difficult for young white collar Irish workers to find employment outside of Ireland. ""I definitely feel like we're being [painted] with the one brush,"" says Hopkins. ""They think of us as being skilled in electric, or like plumbers and brick layers, but there's a lot more to the Irish culture and the Irish people."" With each generation, emigration . Emigration is a rite of passage for many young Irish adults looking to explore new cultures and gain a global outlook. Take David McWilliams - long before he became an economist, he left Ireland to attend college in Brussels. But now many of those leaving the country have already been educated and are looking for employment, McWilliams says. ""You have one person emigrating every seven minutes out of Ireland, adding up to about 66,000 every year,"" McWilliams says. ""It's substantial, it's a very educated portion of the population, and a very young part of the population."" Many Irish economists, including McWilliams, are concerned a prolonged 'brain-drain' could further slow the country's financial growth. ""These kids [that are leaving] are clever and hard working,"" McWilliams explains. ""Immigration is quite self selecting. Those that go tend to be the ones with more get up and go, so you lose an enormous demographic catalyst to growth and to prosperity."" Previous Irish emigrants say they also notice a stark difference in the mood of the country during this period of exodus. Andy Donnellan lives in Galway, on Ireland's west coast. Donnellan says after he came back to Ireland from the United States in the 1990s, there was a sense of optimism as the country began to excel economically. Now, Donnellan says, many young emigrants have little idea when they'll return. ""Everybody is touched by it,"" Donnellan says. ""I have nephews that have left, I have friends that have left. And I always think it's a good thing for any young person to go away and learn another culture and another language. But the unfortunate thing is the vast majority are leaving because there is absolutely nothing here."" That sense of hopelessness seems to permeate throughout Ireland, as frustrated family members and job seekers vent to radio call-in programs and newspapers. As one woman recently wrote in the Irish Times, emigration used to feel like a life style choice. Now, ""it feels like a life sentence."" Is 'laziness' fueling emigration? For some young Irish adults, the mass emigration is more of a fad than necessity. As more young Irish leave, these critics say, the ones that stay behind feel like they are left out of a mass cultural experience. ""At the moment, all I've heard is positive feedback because they're in a different country and they're young and they're living the life,"" says Ireland Student Union Vice President Karl Miller. ""It's just kind of a thing where half the people I went to school with are over there now and they just are going around delivering pizzas and just doing part time jobs that have no relevance to their future,"" Miller says. ""I think there's a certain laziness as well,"" adds Miller, who believes some people are using the poor economy as an excuse to party abroad. There are no wide demographic studies showing why young Irish adults are leaving. Meanwhile, a small number of entrepreneurs have returned to Ireland after starting successful companies in Ireland, New Zealand and Canada. Overwhelmingly on blogs and other online postings, young Irish adults express anxiety about their country's economy, and seem ready to embrace better financial opportunities abroad. Yet others, like recent college graduate Sinead Donlon, seem to view emigration as a chance to add some excitement to life. Donlon plans on moving to England to live with her cousin. Trained as a personal care assistant, Donlon says she's looking for bar work in London as a way to meet new people. ""I did special needs assistance and I'm qualified in that, but there's no jobs for that at the moment [in Ireland],"" Donlon says. Asked if she thinks whether there might be jobs in her field in London, Donlon pauses for a moment before laughing. ""Yeah, I didn't really think about that!"" Donlon says.","One third of Irish men under 25 are unemployed .
Many of the young emigrants are extremely skilled .
Some young people blame emigration on laziness ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- When a two-member panel holds a California parole hearing for notorious murderer Charles Manson on Wednesday, he will be represented by state-appointed attorney DeJon R. Lewis, who will urge the state to put Manson in a mental hospital, Lewis told CNN. Manson, 77, and Lewis, 45, who was a small boy at the time of the ""Manson family"" killings in 1969, haven't yet met. In fact, it is unclear whether Manson will attend the parole hearing, his attorney said. ""He didn't come to my interview either, so I have never met him,"" Lewis said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""I went to go interview him last month. I asked the correction officers was he coming out of his cell, and they said nope. And I said OK, who's the next inmate?"" Lewis is a Ventura, California, general practitioner lawyer who also works as a state-appointed attorney for inmates at about nine parole hearings every two months, he said. ""I always knew in the back of my mind that there was an opportunity to do this for someone of this notoriety,"" Lewis said about being assigned to represent Manson at the hearing. ""I've worked in many prisons. I'm not this crusader to go in and get people accused of murder off. But if they have earned a second chance and done the proper courses and gone to AA and anger management and shown remorse and have a job waiting for them and a residence, I'm all for parole,"" he said. Lewis will tell the parole board that Manson is in need of psychiatric care at Atascadero State Hospital, about 95 miles southwest of the state prison in Corcoran, California, where he is serving a life sentence and where the parole hearing will also take place. Corcoran is about 170 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. A recent prison photo released to CNN shows Manson yielding to old age -- with unruly long gray hair and a full beard, but with subdued eyes that no longer flash a signature Helter-Skelter menace. Manson still bears a swastika tattooed on his forehead above, and between, his eyes. ""Charles Manson does not need incarceration at this point in his life,"" Lewis said. ""He needs hospitalization. ""I mean the issues in regard to his psychiatric makeup and the health concerns that a 76- or 77-year-old man would need,"" he explained. ""What he did was heinous from what he said. How many years has he been in prison? I was just a little boy, but after all these years, has there been any rehabilitation? I don't know. He probably needs more hospitalization than incarceration."" Manson was initially sentenced to death for the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six others by a group of his followers as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite a race war. The enduring fascination of the Sharon Tate murder . His death sentence was changed to life in prison after California's death penalty was overturned for a period during the 1970s. Manson has been denied parole 11 times. The last time he appeared at his parole hearing was 15 years ago. In an interview Tuesday with CNN, Debra Tate, the sister of Sharon Tate, said she has been attending Manson's parole hearings for the past 15 years -- and Manson has not shown up. Tate agreed with some legal experts' observations that Wednesday's parole hearing could be the last one for the aging Manson, who, if he's denied parole this week, may not be eligible again until as late as 2027. If it denies parole for Manson, the two-member panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings can schedule his next hearing three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years from now, said spokeswoman Terry Thornton of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Said Tate: ""I'm hoping he'll show up this time, and then I will have a lot more to say. ""He needs to look into our eyes, victims' eyes, and see the pain that he has caused,"" Tate added. ""I think that that is something that is essential to his coming to peace, perhaps before he passes. ""As you said, this is probably going to be his last parole hearing,"" she told CNN. Tate acknowledged that Manson holds a prominent -- and grisly -- place among mass murderers. ""There is a unique social icon kind of a thing that goes along with the Manson family,"" Tate said. ""They have made murder popular. They have more followers than they have ever had. There have been murders done in their name. Quite frankly, I do not understand it. I understand there are a lot of young people that are looking for something to believe in, but I don't see how you could possibly think this man is leadership material. I don't get it."" Lewis, Manson's state-appointed attorney, said he would be surprised if Manson shows up to the parole hearing, but he's still hoping it happens. ""That will shock me too, but I'm going to do what I have to do. I'm anticipating him doing that, changing his mind and coming out,"" Lewis said. ""I would hope he would. Then my argument would basically be established, that he needs hospitalization and not incarceration at this point. That's my theme."" As a boy, Lewis said he remembered reading ""Helter Skelter,"" the best-selling book about the Manson family rampage. ""Even now all these years later, it's the kind of thing that goes boo in the night,"" Lewis said of the killings. ""People are scared. I read a copy of 'Helter Skelter,' a copy in my grandmother's house. I think I was on punishment. I couldn't put it down. I didn't read the whole thing, but I read enough to know it was a horrible, horrible time."" Former prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, who co-authored ""Helter Skelter"" and prosecuted Manson and members of his ""family,"" said he believed Manson won't be paroled. ""Look at his two co-defendants right now who are still alive,"" he said of Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, who are still imprisoned on life sentences. ""He orchestrated and was behind all the murders. ""It's preposterous on its face. Basically, it's a nonissue and not going to happen,"" Bugliosi said of the possibility of parole. ""Manson knows this. He frequently hasn't showed up at parole hearings."" In attempting to ignite an apocalyptic race war that Manson called ""Helter Skelter"" after a Beatles song, Manson's ""family"" took the lives of seven people over two nights in August 1969 in Los Angeles: They inflicted 169 stab wounds and seven .22-caliber gunshot wounds. They used the blood of their victims to scrawl anti-establishment messages on the walls: ""Pig,"" ""Death to Pigs,"" ""Rise"" and a misspelled ""Healter Skelter."" Actress Tate, 26, famed hairstylist Jay Sebring, 35, coffee fortune heiress Abigail Folger, 25, and two others died shortly after midnight on August 9, 1969, at a rambling house overlooking Benedict Canyon. Tate was married to director Roman Polanski and eight months pregnant. She begged in vain for her life, saying she wanted to live to have her baby, according to Bugliosi. The next night, grocer Leno LaBianca, 44, and his wife, Rosemary, 38, were butchered in their home in the wealthy Los Feliz neighborhood. Rosemary LaBianca was stabbed 41 times. A fork jutted from Leno LaBianca's abdomen, where one of his killers had carved the word ""war."" Manson has not been a model inmate. A prosecutor who handled his parole hearings told CNN in 2009 that Manson had a ""laundry list of violations in prison."" In the past five years, he was punished for threatening a peace officer and for having a weapon, the latter happening in October when he had a sharpened pen, a corrections department spokeswoman said. Manson also had a contraband cell phone twice, the latest time in January 2011. Prison officials said they tracked phone numbers in California, Oregon and Maine. Manson has been an inmate in the 24-cell protective housing unit of the California State Prison Corcoran since 1989, said Thornton, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman. The unit is for inmates whose safety would be endangered in a general population prison yard, and it still functions like such a yard, she said. Other inmates in the unit with Manson are Phillip Garrido, 61, who held Jaycee Dugard captive for 18 years; Juan Corona, 78, who murdered 25 migrant workers; and John Albert Gardner, 33, who killed and raped two teenage girls in San Diego County, California, Thornton said.","Charles Manson's attorney will urge the parole board to put Manson in a mental hospital .

Through his father Julius, Jurre told CNN he had an idea to solve the euro crisis and also thought the prize money sounded ""attractive."" Jurre, the youngest entrant to the prize, proposed Greece should leave the euro, with the Greek people slotting their funds into a bank ""exchange machine"" and getting drachma -- the Greek currency before the country joined the euro in 2001 -- back. As Jurre explains in his application, the bank then gives the euros to the Greek government and ""all these euros together form a pancake or a pizza. Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza."" Jurre noted the ""clever part"" of his idea was that the Greek people would not want to change their euros for drachma, because they know the currency would depreciate. However, if they hide their euros, Jurre said they should be slapped with severe financial penalties. Wolfson: Why Europe needs to think about a euro collapse . Jurre wrote: ""In this way I ensure that all Greeks bring their euros to a greek bank and so the greek government can pay back all the debts. I hope my idea helps you!!!!""

"(CNN) -- A top European Union official expressed concern Thursday about the condition of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, saying she was roughed up in prison. Tymoshenko is serving a seven-year sentence after last year's conviction on a charge of abuse of authority. The two-time prime minister said Tuesday she was beaten unconscious in prison last week, but the prosecutor said his office investigated her claim and found no proof to substantiate her allegations. Thursday, however, the spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Tymoshenko's claim was confirmed. ""Today the Ukrainian Ombudsperson's Office confirmed that Ms. Tymoshenko was subjected to physical violence during the transfer from her cell to a hospital on 20 April,"" read a statement from Ashton's office. Ashton called on Ukraine ""to examine promptly and impartially any complaints of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,"" according to the statement. Tymoshenko went on a hunger strike after the beating to draw attention to ""violence and lack of rights"" in her country. Ashton's statement said she is ""seriously concerned"" about Tymoshenko's hunger strike. She asked Ukraine to allow the EU ambassador and independent medical specialists to visit the former prime minister in prison. Tymoshenko said she was discussing with officials a transfer to a hospital for health reasons before the beating. In a statement, Tymoshenko said that on Friday evening, after her cell mate left the cell, ""three sturdy men"" entered, threw a bed sheet over her, dragged her off the bed and applied ""brutal force."" ""In pain and despair, I started to defend myself as I could and got a strong blow in my stomach through the bed sheet,"" she said in a statement. Tymoshenko was dragged ""into the street,"" she said. ""I thought these were the last minutes of my life. In unbearable pain and fear I started to cry and call out for help, but no help came."" She fell unconscious, and when she came to, she was in a hospital ward, she said. Last October, a Ukrainian court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing overpriced gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to the seven-year prison term. The prosecutor said the gas deals inflicted damages to the country amounting to more than 1.5 billion hryvnas (almost $190 million at the current exchange rate). The court ruled she must repay the money. Amnesty International has slammed the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005 and December 2007 to March 2010.","EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton says she is concerned .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Australian airline Qantas is shedding another 500 jobs as it seeks to cut costs after a massive fall in net profit in the first half of the financial year. Net profit dived 83% to $45 million (A$42M) in the six months to December due to rising fuel prices and flight cancellations during an industrial dispute in October. Chief executive Alan Joyce talked up the results, saying the airline's portfolio of businesses had once again shown ""resilience in difficult conditions."" ""Improvements in operating cash flow, revenue, yield and unit costs, and record results for Jetstar and Qantas Frequent Flyer, helped offset the financial effect on the Group,"" he said. Jetstar, the company's low-cost carrier, set a new record for operating earnings before interest and tax of $147 million, up 4% on the previous period. And despite flight disruptions, the airline now counts 8.3 million frequent fliers who are also contributing to profits. The airline's shares rose in Sydney as investors signaled their approval of the company's plans to slash capital expenditure by $700 million over the next two financial years. The carrier announced that it was reviewing its maintenance facilities in Australia and consolidating its catering and engineering operations. Joyce conceded that the airline had been hit hard by industrial action, however he said that the airline's brand and customer satisfaction ratings had improved ""signficantly"" since the grounding. At the time, thousands of passengers were stranded at airports around the world after Qantas ordered the grounding of 447 flights. The labor relations tribunal Fair Work Australia stepped in at the behest of the government and ordered an end to the two-day dispute to avoid damage to the tourism industry. The grounding was a flashpoint in a long-term battle between Qantas and unions representing pilots and engineers working for the Australian domestic and international airline. Union officials have accused the airline of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs and of putting profits first. Pay and working conditions have also been at the center of the dispute. Qantas, which has its headquarters in Sydney, is the second-oldest airline in the world and marked its 90th anniversary last year. It employs about 32,500 people and flies to more than 180 destinations worldwide, according to the company website.","Qantas net profit falls 83% in six months to end of December .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Llorente's dramatic last minute goal sealed an all-Spanish Europa League final as Athletic Bilbao booked a clash with Atletico Madrid in Bucharest. The forward's late strike finally settled a pulsating tie against Portugal's Sporting Lisbon ensuring Bilbao triumphed 3-1 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate. The Basque side will face Atletico Madrid in the final on May 9 after their fellow Spanish team won 1-0 away at Valencia to record an impressive 5-2 aggregate victory. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg in Portugal, Bilbao leveled the tie when Markel Susaeta fired into the net after Llorente had chested a cross into his path. Just before halftime Sporting's Dutch striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel smashed a low shot into the net to edge the away side in front once again. But a minute later Ibai Gomez locked the tie at 3-3 on aggregate and 2-1 on the night after he converted following a glorious piece of skill from Llorente, who beat a man before flicking the ball into his teammate's path. Both sides hit the woodwork in the second half, Llorente with a header and Emiliano Insua with a vicious long range strike, but the game looked destined for extra time. That was until the final minute of normal time when Gomez turned inside the area and crossed for star man Llorente to poke home at the near post and send the San Mames stadium into raptures. In the other semifinal, Valencia came charging out of the blocks, determined to reverse Atletico's 4-2 advantage from the first leg but striker Roberto Soldado wasted two clear cut chances. The decisive blow was struck on the hour mark as Adrian Lopez took down a long pass on his chest before thumping a fierce volley into the net. With the tie all but wrapped up, a moment of madness from Atletico's Portuguese midfielder Thiago cost him a place in the final after an extraordinary melee on the field. Thinking Thiago had handled a cross the referee pointed to the penalty spot, but replays showed it was a Valencia forward who had made contact with the ball. As players from both sides argued with the referee, Thiago slapped Soldado and then trod on Jordi Alba's foot, earning him a red card and a suspension for the final. After consultation with his assistants, the referee then reversed his penalty decision and awarded a free kick to Atletico. The Europa League final will be held in the Romanian capital Bucharest on May 9.","Europa League final to be all-Spanish clash between Athletic Bilbao and Atletico Madrid .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday said it was studying a federal judge's order that it consider withdrawing two popular antibiotics from use in livestock. In a ruling issued Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz said that the FDA must issue notices to drug manufacturers that the drugs will be withdrawn unless the companies can prove they're safe. Katz didn't issue a full ban -- suggesting the manufacturers should be given a hearing to make their case. The suit was originally brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council, which argued that the FDA has allowed livestock producers to use popular antibiotics penicillin and tetracycline in feed for more than 30 years for purposes other than treatment of illnesses. The NRDC claims ""the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in animal feed can lead to the growth and spread of drug-resistant bacteria capable of infecting people."" Antibiotic resistant bacteria are fast-moving, can be deadly, and can infect otherwise healthy individuals. In its statement, the FDA said, ""We are studying the opinion and considering appropriate next steps."" Thursday's ruling can be traced back to decisions the FDA made more than 30 years ago. In 1977, the FDA announced plans to withdraw approval of some antibiotics used in livestock feed. The drugs have been used by livestock producers to help promote growth and feed efficiency. At the time, the FDA found the practice of using antibiotics for non-medical reasons unsafe. Drug manufacturers requested hearings, but the FDA never scheduled meetings and nothing else was done. The approval remained in place. In subsequent years, new medical evidence suggested that treating livestock with antibiotics increased risks to human health. But according to the judge's ruling, the FDA never changed its position. In May, two petitions circulated urging the FDA to finish what it started in 1977. When the FDA didn't respond, the NRDC filed suit. In December, the FDA withdrew the original 1977 notices saying they were outdated. The suit alleged that the FDA's failure to withdraw approval of penicillin and tetracycline after the 1977 research was unlawful and violated the administrative procedure act. According to the NRDC, 80% of antibiotics used in the United States is used in livestock. The group also says 29.8 million pounds of antibiotics were used in livestock in 2009, up dramatically from the previous decade. Meanwhile, the ruling isn't sitting well with beef producers. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association noted its dissent in a statement saying its members were ""disappointed with the decision,"" and that practices include the ""judicious use of antibiotics to prevent, control and treat any cattle health issues."" If drug manufacturers fail to show that using the antibiotics in livestock is safe, the FDA commissioner must issue a withdrawal order. But the judge noted that if the drugs are deemed safe, the FDA cannot withdraw them from use.","The FDA says it will study the order .

"New York (CNN) -- She might have gone unnoticed through the many years of triumphs and tragedies of the Kennedy family. Now the spotlight will be cast, sadly, on Mary Richardson Kennedy. The estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was found dead Wednesday in Bedford, New York, the small town north of New York City where she lived. She died of asphyxiation due to hanging, the Westchester County medical examiner said. The Kennedy clan will gather once again for a funeral. This time, it's Mary's. Mary Kennedy's family blasts stories on her death . A wake was planned for Friday evening, Kennedy family publicist Ken Sunshine said. It will take place in the Bedford mansion that Kennedy, an architect, and her husband lovingly restored into an eco-friendly home after flooding left it infested with black mold. Her funeral is planned for Saturday morning at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Bedford, Sunshine said. A private memorial service has also been planned in Manhattan, Kennedy's family said in a statement. She will be buried in Hyannisport, Massachusetts, where the Kennedy family has a compound. Mary Kennedy married Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 1994. The prominent environmental lawyer is the third of 11 children born to Ethel and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was gunned down in 1968. Mary Kennedy: 'Green' designer, wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The assassination was one of a string of tragedies to befall the Kennedy family, America's royal family in the absence of monarchy. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, five years before his younger brother. More than three decades later, in 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr.; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy; and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, died when a plane he was piloting crashed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. David Kennedy died of a drug overdose in 1984, and Michael Kennedy was killed in a skiing accident in 1997. Both were sons of Robert F. Kennedy Sr. ""We know from a history of this family, it's very hard being a Kennedy, either being a blood Kennedy or being married to one,"" Kennedy biographer Laurence Leamer said. ""The overwhelming celebrity, the attention, the obligations, the expectations that you're supposed to do something with your life. It's very, very hard."" And now comes the shock of Mary Kennedy's death at age 52, though her troubles were well-known. The details of the couple's private life surfaced after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed for divorce in 2010. After that, Mary Kennedy was charged once with driving while intoxicated and once with driving while impaired by prescription drugs, according to Bedford police. ""A lot of times, I don't know how she made it through the day,"" Robert Kennedy told The New York Times. ""She was in a lot of agony for a lot of her life."" Her family criticized media accounts of her death for what they called ""inaccuracies and misrepresentations"" of her life. ""While we would naturally prefer to remain private at this very upsetting time, we feel compelled to make this statement because the description of Mary carried by certain news organizations since her passing yesterday is wholly inconsistent with the sister we knew and the life she, in fact, lived,"" her family said in a written statement. ""We loved Mary and knew her to be an exceptional mother, sibling and friend to many,"" they said. ""Countless people have described her as an extraordinary mother, selfless in her desire to help others, and one of the finest people in the world. We know her as all those things, and more."" Mary Kennedy stood by her husband's side, bearing Kennedy grief through the years. Now, it is her turn to be grieved. ""You know, you sometimes hear things like 'I've lost my right arm'?"" Kerry Kennedy, sister of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told The New York Times about the friend she met in boarding school and roomed with at Brown University. ""I feel like I've lost half my body, half my soul."" CNN's Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.","Mary Kennedy married Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 1994 .

"Augusta, Georgia (CNN) -- From grandma to grandson, from fan to foe, the throngs at Augusta are happy Tiger Woods is back in form and ready to contend for a fifth Masters title. Like Arnold Palmer had his army, Tiger certainly has his troop. Thousands of patrons lined the fairways on Augusta National Golf Club's front nine Tuesday morning as Woods played a practice round. They crammed themselves as many as 10 deep around the greens and moved from tee to green like waves going up each side of the fairways. ""I think he's going to bring a lot of people back to the game,"" said Will Brown, an Augusta resident who was following Woods with his wife and two sons. ""He's good for golf."" As he spoke, his son Zeke, 6, tugged at his father's pant leg, begging to go to the practice tee to wait in line for Woods' autograph. ""He's very special,"" Zeke squeaked about his favorite golf star. Woods scored his first official PGA Tour victory in two and a half years two weeks ago, winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in Florida by five strokes. It was also his first victory since disclosure of his marital infidelities, which led to divorce. In the months between those wins, his game nosedived and he plummeted from the top spot in the world golf rankings, even falling out of the top 50. He's rebounded to No. 7 and rebounded with the fans, too. Leo Brown, a 60-year-old from Greenville, South Carolina, was pleased to see Woods back in the winner's column. ""He showed all the doubters that he still had a game,"" Brown said. SI.com: Tiger Woods shows this is his Masters to lose . Some never were doubters, including Qabaniso Lupafya, a native of Zimbabwe who moved to Massachusetts 26 years ago and now lives in Worcester. ""I love Tiger. I'm obsessed with him,"" said Lupafya, who also goes by Frank for those who can't pronounce his name. He said his goal is to play with Woods one day. Lupafya, a former rugby player, said watching Woods -- and a nasty knee injury -- inspired him to take up golf four years ago. He's down to a six handicap, he said, and has won local tournaments, but he'll just be watching Woods from the other side of the ropes at Augusta. ""I got a date with Tiger. I'll see ya!"" he said Tuesday morning, scampering down the ninth fairway in search of his idol. Gary Hanson of Palm Beach, Florida, also had a date with Tiger on Tuesday morning, but don't count him among Woods' fans. That's because Woods doesn't respect the fans, he said, adding the golf star had done little to acknowledge their cheers in Tuesday morning's practice round. ""Without the fans, where are you?"" Hanson asked. So why was he making the trek around Augusta's back nine for a meaningless round on a gray Tuesday morning? ""The wife loves him,"" he said. He looked over to the ropes where his wife, Gail, followed Woods as he walked up to the sixth green. ""She's in love with him!"" For himself, Hanson said, he'd rather be following Phil Mickelson. ""And you know why? Because he interacts with the fans,"" Hanson said. Don't tell the kids Woods doesn't interact. Up by the practice green, they squeezed against the railings of the junior autograph area, hoping to get Woods to sign whatever they had handy. Golf.com: Most-anticipated Masters in years . Alec Cwienkala, a 13-year-old from Allentown, Pennsylvania, scored Woods's signature on his flag. ""It was really cool being up close to him,"" said Alec, who waited 90 minutes in the autograph area. Woods and the other Masters participants have been examples for his own game, Alec said. ""I try to make my swing like all those pros,"" the young golfer said. And maybe watching Woods is something that will inspire new generations of players to take the game to new levels. Vicki Martin of St. Cloud, Minnesota, said she thinks there's something to that argument. ""Tiger makes these young kids what they are today,"" said Martin, noting that Woods athleticism and conditioning regimen has set the standard for others and elevated the game as a whole. Martin said Woods has inspired her 13-year-old grandson. ""He's obsessed with Tiger,"" she said. ""He says, 'I want to play in the Masters.'"" Woods has elevated more than just the sport, said Jim Banks, a retired Army colonel from Fort Hood, Texas. That's because if Woods is bringing people out to PGA Tour events, the charities that golf supports are able to do more for those they serve. ""Think about the revenue created for the charities,"" Banks said. ""It's he, and he alone, who does that."" Out along Washington Road, the main route from Interstate 20 to the course, Woods' resurgence is having another kind of economic effect. Those who came to Augusta without tickets are paying more to buy passes from the roadside brokers. Tye Bedwell of Chattanooga, Tennessee, his brother and a friend lucked into two passes at face value from a passing motorist, Bedwell said. But they still needed a third and hadn't found anything under $350 at noon Tuesday. ""We're not going to pay $350,"" he said. ""The ticket price has spiked up,"" said Randall Matod, who said he's been trading tickets on Washington Avenue for the past 30 years. He had sold passes for Tuesday's practice round for $250, he said, but was looking for new inventory at lunchtime. For Sunday's final round, they'll be around $500 -- and they'd be higher, he said, but the fact that Sunday is Easter is keeping the price dampened a bit. Of course, that Easter Sunday deduction may well be eliminated if Woods is atop the leaderboard on Saturday night. ""I couldn't say I'm pulling for him to win. It just makes golf more interesting,"" said Jordan Myers of Columbia, South Carolina, who was watching for Woods with his brother and father. ""Golf is way better with Tiger,"" said Alec's father, Steve Cwienkala. ""Whether you love him or hate him, the sport needs him.""","Tiger Woods is contending for his fifth Masters title .

"(CNN) -- A former Florida middle school principal stabbed four people Friday at a group home for the hearing impaired, killing two of them, then struck five others with a car, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said. The suspect -- identified by the sheriff's office as Anthony Giancola -- was taken into police custody after being tracked down by K-9 unit members. He has been arrested and formally booked on two counts of first-degree murder, sheriff's spokeswoman Cecilia Barreda said. Authorities said they first learned around 10:45 a.m. that four people had been stabbed at the group home in Lealman, a community just north of St. Petersburg. One man, later identified as 27-year-old Justin Lee Vanderbergh, was pronounced dead at the scene, the sheriff's office said. Three women were sent to a local hospital, where one of them -- 59-year-old Mary Anne Allis -- ended up succumbing to her injuries. The other two, ages 25 and 43, suffered what the sheriff's office said were non-life-threatening injuries. All four stabbed were the only residents of the one-story home, Barreda said. After talking with witnesses, authorities identified the suspect as the 45-year-old Giancola. The suspect fled the scene and headed toward a motel in nearby Pinellas Park, where a man and woman were assaulted, authorities said. The sheriff's office said the man's injuries ""appear to be life-threatening."" From there, the suspect left and is thought to have spoken briefly to people outside a duplex before abruptly leaving, then returning in his vehicle -- slamming into three women and one man in the process. The women were all transported to an area hospital, while the man chose not to go. The sheriff's office said the suspect then drove west and struck another person, this time a 13-year-old boy. The child suffered only minor injuries. The suspect ended up at the Egg Platter restaurant in Pinellas Park, where he left his vehicle, entered another vehicle and fled. He was detained shortly after 1 p.m., the sheriff's office said. Barreda explained that the sheriff's office is only responsible for levying charges in certain areas, adding that Giancola could face more charges from police in other jurisdictions for the alleged assaults and hit-and-runs. He is now in Pinellas County Jail awaiting his initial court appearance. It was not clear whether he had retained a lawyer. This is not Giancola's first run-in with the law. In February 2007, when he was a principal at a middle school in Hillsborough County, he was caught buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer -- an exchange captured on video that happened inside his principal's office while school was in session. Months later, he pleaded guilty and that June told CNN that there was ""no excuse for my behavior."" Giancola said at his sentencing that he hoped to become a drug counselor after being released from jail. ""Before I could ever hope to go on and help anyone again, I need to help myself,"" Giancola told CNN. ""I'm very thankful I was arrested, and it kind of brought that crazy train to an end."" Then, in early 2010, Giancola was arrested again and charged on two counts -- intent to purchase cocaine and loitering -- according to online records from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. CNN's Greg Botelho and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","Anthony Giancola is in custody on 2 first-degree murder counts, with more charges possible .

"Washington (CNN) -- A hoax mayday call that launched a massive search off the coast of New Jersey last week may be linked to a similar call made last month nearly 1,500 miles away off Texas, authorities said Wednesday. At a news conference in New York, Coast Guard investigators said that in both cases the callers reported their boats were sinking and used similar key words and phrases, leading authorities to believe the calls could have come from the same individual. On May 20, rescuers searched for 36 hours in waters off the coast of Galveston, Texas, and found nothing after a distress call reporting six people stranded in the water, Chief Warrant Officer Lionel Bryant told CNN. Investigators try to track down false yacht mayday . On June 11, a distress call reporting a yacht explosion prompted a massive rescue effort in the water near New Jersey. The call was determined to be fake after no evidence of a boat was found. Officials initially classified the Texas call as unresolved because the Coast Guard could not eliminate the possibility that the distress call came from a vessel in the water. But a Houston television reporter alerted the Coast Guard's New York office to similarities in the two cases, and that led authorities to take a closer look. ""By no means is it a guarantee that this was the same individual that made both calls. We're analyzing the voices on both calls,"" Coast Guard Capt. Gregory Hitchen told reporters. In both instances, the caller described his boat as ""taking on water"" rather than sinking, described the people on board his boat as ""souls,"" said victims were in orange life rafts and used a similar speaking pattern, Hitchen said. Investigators said the calls in both cases seem to have originated from land, he added. The Coast Guard said the estimated cost of the rescue operation in the New Jersey case was $300,000. The agency is relying on the media and tips from the public to find the callers because current technology isn't capable of allowing investigators to pinpoint exactly where the calls came from. Coast Guard offers reward after apparent hoax . But officials are hoping that the person responsible for the false calls finds it difficult to keep quiet. ""They do brag about it in certain cases,"" Hitchen said. More than 100 calls have come in to a tip line, Coast Guard Investigative Service Special Agent Michael Donnelly told reporters Wednesday. Authorities released audio excerpts from both of the mayday calls. In the New Jersey incident, a male voice is heard saying, ""We have 21 souls on board, 20 in the water right now. I have three deceased on board, nine injured because of the explosion we've had. I'm in three feet of water on the bridge. I'm going to stay by the radio as long as I can before I have to go overboard."" In the Texas case, the voice says, ""We're about probably 2 miles from the channel and we are taking on water."" The caller was unable to give an exact location in either call. Anyone convicted of making a false mayday call to the Coast Guard would face six years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but finding such perpetrators has proven difficult for authorities. Investigations rarely have led to an arrest or conviction. There were 60 reported hoax calls in the New York region in 2011, but since 2004 only four people have been convicted for making false distress claims. Authorities don't believe the false calls are terrorism-related. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","The Coast Guard received apparent false mayday calls off New Jersey and Texas .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian porn actor suspected of killing and dismembering a university student in Montreal left Germany and arrived in Canada on Monday, a police official said. Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, was in police custody when he flew back aboard a Canadian military plane. Magnotta faces first-degree murder and other charges in the May slaying of Jun Lin, a 33-year-old Concordia University student from China. He did not fight extradition from Germany after his arrest there this month. ""Now the alleged killer is in Montreal, and he'll be facing justice,"" police spokesman Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere told reporters at the Montreal-Mirabel International Airport, where the suspect touched down in the company of half a dozen officers. Lafreniere said Magnotta is expected to appear in court on Tuesday, but he did not know when or where. ""This is not the end of the investigation,"" the police spokesman said. Authorities accuse Magnotta of dismembering Lin and mailing one of his hands and one of his feet to Canadian politicians. Police also believe Magnotta filmed the death and dismemberment and posted the video to the Internet. Montreal police have said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and also included evidence of cannibalism. Police link Vancouver body parts to Montreal dismemberment suspect . The Canadian government worked with Montreal police, the Quebec Prosecution Service and German officials to bring about Magnotta's extradition, officials said. Berlin police arrested Magnotta at an Internet cafe where he was browsing articles about himself. An employee of the cafe recognized him and flagged down a carload of German police trainees. The arrest ended an international manhunt that began after the body parts were mailed. Authorities have said they believe Magnotta killed Lin on May 24 or 25, posted the video, then flew to France on May 26. He was thought to have boarded a bus to Berlin on June 1 while police were searching for him in Paris, Berlin prosecutors have said. Montreal teacher fired for showing 10th graders a killing, dismemberment video . The case began when a caller complained to police about a strong smell coming from an alley behind Magnotta's Montreal apartment building, Lafreniere has said. Investigators found a torso stuffed inside a suitcase. The same day, officials at Canada's Conservative Party headquarters received a package addressed to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper that contained a foot. Officials later intercepted a package addressed to the Liberal Party that contained a hand. DNA tests showed both were Lin's, Lafreniere has said. The victim's head is still missing. A gay porn actor, stripper and escort, Magnotta was well known to animal rights activists online, who accused him of killing kittens and using the carcasses in sexual acts. Authorities have said they were looking into the animal abuse allegations and also examining possible links to other crimes. The sick fascination with a death video .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek politicians traded insults and accusations following new talks with President Karolos Papoulias to broker a coalition government, an effort that will resume Monday. Papoulias called together the leaders of the three biggest parties Sunday, a week after indecisive elections and three failed attempts to form a government raised the possibility of new elections in the debt-stricken country. His office announced late Sunday that those talks would continue Monday morning. After the meeting, the leader of the radical leftist Syriza coalition said other parties wanted Syriza to be their ""partners in crime,"" adding: ""We can't do that."" Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras suggested the two other largest parties, New Democracy and PASOK, were going to form a coalition with a smaller group, the Democratic Left. But the Democratic Left issued a statement calling Tsipras's remarks ""a disgrace,"" and accusing him of lying and slandering the smaller party. Europe is keeping a nervous eye on Greece, fearing that the political chaos there could lead to defaults on debt that could threaten the future of the euro. Greek failure -- or refusal -- to make debt payments could hurt banks across Europe. The talks with Papoulias came a week after elections in which angry voters punished mainstream parties by backing a range of fringe groups. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis held his own meeting with Papoulias late Sunday. So did Nikolaos Michaloliakos, the head of the far-right Golden Dawn party. Michaloliakos emerged from talks saying any new government would need an internationally respected premier with the clout to reject the bailout package the previous government signed, calling the deal ""a crime against our country."" If no government can be cobbled together by May 17, new elections must be called. They would take place next month. Papoulias said he hoped he could help form a unity government, adding that ""things in Greece are quite difficult"" -- but things only looked more difficult after Sunday's talks. Tsipras, whose party came in second last week on a platform of rejecting the conditions that international lenders have placed on the country, said that New Democracy, PASOK and the Democratic Left could form a majority government without the backing of his party. Polls suggest that Syriza, which came second in voting last week, would come first if another round of elections is held. ""The three parties have 168 seats together. They can go ahead with that. They are pressuring us to participate, and that is an irrational and unprecedented request. They want us to give a fake sense of legalization,"" he said. But the Democratic Left said it had not agreed to back a coalition without Syriza, and said of Tsipras: ""His obvious inability to justify his stance should not lead him to slander and lie. This is an unethical political act on his part."" Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the Socialist party PASOK, said after the meeting that his party would do everything possible to form a national unity government, but that they were ready for new elections if necessary. Venizelos had gone to Papoulias on Saturday to admit he could not form a government, making him the third politician in a week to fail to form a coalition. Antonis Samaras, the leader of the center-right New Democracy party, said before the meeting on Sunday that the voters had called for collaboration, change, and staying within the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use a common currency. Papoulias met Samaras, Venizelos and Tsipras together on Sunday. The president will hold talks with the leaders of smaller parties later in the day. Independent Greek Party leader Panos Kammenos complained about the way Papoulias was organizing the meetings, saying all party leaders should meet together. The Communist party, meanwhile, called for new elections, saying they will not participate in a coalition government. Four out of five voters said they would vote the same way in a new election, according to a poll published Saturday by the newspaper Kathimerini. Three out of five said they believed new elections would be held soon, and just over half said they were not happy with the results of the vote on May 6. In a separate poll published Sunday by the newspaper Vima, seven out of 10 people said they wanted the parties to form a coalition government. Syriza would come top if new elections were held, the Vima poll suggested, after coming in second behind New Democracy a week ago. But the results would still lead to a deeply divided parliament, the poll suggested, with no party getting more than 21% of the vote. In the same poll, six out of 10 voters said Syriza's plans were not realistic. Party leader Tsipras made a radical speech last week against austerity. The Vima poll appeared to show a fall in support for Syriza since mid-week, when a survey put them first with 28% of the vote. In Sunday's poll they had the support of 20.5% of respondents. A poll by Metron analysis published on Saturday gave them 20.2%. Syriza came in second in last week's election with 16.8%. The party is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. The country's lenders have said that if Greece does not comply with the bailout terms then payments will stop. Deep uncertainty surrounds the political situation in Greece after large numbers of voters in last Sunday's election backed parties opposed to the country's bailout deal. Severe austerity measures are required under the terms of the bailout, agreed to by the outgoing coalition government of PASOK and New Democracy. Headlines in Saturday's papers talk about ""Elections on the Titanic"" and ""Opening the door to an exit from the euro."" Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts so far. But last week's election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the economic measures, which include policies to cut spending and raise taxes to reduce public debts. Seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote, leading to a week of political turmoil. The stakes are potentially huge for the rest of the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use the euro as single currency. There is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece's bailout agreement. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece, which would force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. The eurozone economy is fragile, and any financial shock could plunge the region into a deep recession, a development that would ripple across the globe.

"(CNN) -- In the NFL, controlled violence is, and always will be, an essential part of the sport. As fans, we have no problem with coaches telling players to run hard, hit hard and tackle hard, because we know that we can't take that kind of contact and tough physicality out of football. However, as a long-time fan of the NFL, when I heard the audio of former New Orleans Saints Defensive Coordinator Gregg Williams instructing his team to injure members of the San Francisco 49ers before their playoff game in January, I was really bothered. Williams explicitly commanded his defense to target particular players with the intent of injuring them and taking them out of the game. Talking about 49ers star running back Frank Gore, Williams said, ""We've got to do everything in the world to make sure we kill Frank Gore's head. We want him running sideways. We want his head sideways."" Williams coached his players to take out the knees of the 49ers No. 1 receiver, Michael Crabtree. ""We need to decide whether Crabtree wants to be a fake-ass prima donna, or he wants to be a tough guy. We need to find out. He becomes human when we (expletive) take out that outside ACL,"" Williams said, referring to the anterior cruciate ligament, one of the major ligaments in the knee, which when torn or injured can end a player's season. Another 49ers receiver, Kyle Williams, entered the game recovering from a concussion and Gregg Williams told his players, ""We need to find out in the first two series of the game, that little wide receiver, No. 10, about his concussion. We need to (expletive) put a lick on him right now. He needs to decide."" The difference between Williams' comments and typical football coaching rhetoric, which can be almost as coarse, is that the violence is personalized. As Shakespeare wrote, it gives ""to airy nothingness a local habitation and a name."" Williams was not just talking about tackling; he targeted specific players and specific parts of their bodies. His intent was to hurt 49ers players, rather than to stop them. This may be a subtle distinction, but it is a real one. And such distinctions determine whether the game of football is played within or outside the rules. The Williams audio makes the seriousness of the NFL's bounty scandal very real. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has made it clear that the NFL will not tolerate this type of violence or any bounty systems. His indefinite suspension of Williams and separate suspensions and punishments levied on the Saints were meant to send a loud and clear message to the rest of the league as well as fans of the sport that the NFL takes this issue seriously. On Monday, Goodell stood tough and rejected the Saints' appeal and upheld the season-long suspension of Saints Coach Sean Payton and two other team executives. The NFL's tough response leads us to wonder how it will respond to another violence-related problem threatening the league: the growing concussion-driven Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy epidemic. In 2009, a study commissioned by the NFL reported that former players between the ages of 30 and 49 were 19 times more likely to be diagnosed with severe memory-related diseases than an average person. Today's coaches, trainers, and players are much more aware of the severity of head trauma than those of a decade ago, but some say it's too little too late. Jim McMahon, the successful NFL quarterback of the late 1980s and early 1990s, recently admitted that, because of multiple concussions, his ""memory's pretty much gone. There are a lot of times when I walk into a room and forget why I walked in there."" Legendary running back Tony Dorsett was one of the most recent players to join more than 300 former NFL players in suing the NFL for negligence in their handling of concussions and other injuries. Dorsett, who is also battling memory loss, says that the league should have done more to warn players about the consequences of head trauma. The problem doesn't fall solely on the shoulders of the NFL. Scientific evidence is clear that concussions have devastating effects on our youngest athletes. Teenagers with multiple concussions can exhibit memory loss, amnesia and significantly lower grade-point averages than teenagers without head injuries. By the time they reach the NFL, these young adults can be one or two concussions away from serious brain damage. The NFL is a valuable institution that has done much good for our youth and Goodell has done a fine, exemplary job so far. He sent a strong, clear message to Gregg Williams and the Saints that illegal forms of contact and violence within the sport will not be permitted. Let's hope he handles the concussion problem with similar clarity, and continues to protect players while maintaining the physicality and integrity of the sport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell turns down appeals of bounty punishments .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- The sweeping victory of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party in recent elections has been confirmed by state media. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, or NLD, won 43 of the 44 seats it contested in the by-elections that took place Sunday, the government's official MRTV reported late Tuesday, confirming the NLD's own estimates of the results. The other seat went to the Shan Party in Myanmar's Shan State, MRTV said. While control of parliament will not change despite the opposition's strong performance, it nonetheless gives the NLD and Suu Kyi a notable presence in the country's parliament. Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). The 45 seats under contention in Sunday's elections were vacancies created by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. The vote itself also marked an important step forward for many in the country who have lived under military rule for 50 years. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a regional organizations of which Myanmar is a member, on Tuesday called on other countries around the globe to lift sanctions on Myanmar following ""the orderly, fair, transparent and peaceful manner"" in which it said the elections had been conducted. Myanmar had invited election observers from ASEAN members as well as the United States and the European Union. The NLD fielded a candidate for every one of the 45 seats up for grabs. But the election commission rejected one candidate, apparently because his parents had foreign residency. The NLD has said it plans to challenge his exclusion. The USDP won that seat, according to state television. The party also said it had noted numerous voting irregularities during the elections and planned to file a complaint in order to improve the system in the future. Suu Kyi has said she has no regrets about taking part in the by-elections because the process has raised people's political awareness. A White House statement Monday congratulated Suu Kyi and the people of Myanmar, also known as Burma. ""This election is an important step in Burma's democratic transformation, and we hope it is an indication that the government of Burma intends to continue along the path of greater openness, transparency, and reform,"" the White House statement said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also commended the country ""for the peaceful and largely orderly manner"" in which the elections were held, according to his spokesperson. Suu Kyi, 66, led her party to a landslide victory the last time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990. But the junta ignored the results and placed her under house arrest. Released in November 2010, Suu Kyi was allowed to crisscross the country to rally support for the NLD for Sunday's race. The United States announced in January that it would exchange ambassadors with Myanmar after the regime released political prisoners.","Myanmar's neighbors have called for a lifting of sanctions after the elections .

"(CNN) -- The trial of Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted killing 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in Norway last summer, is under way in Oslo. In a new courtroom specially built in the Norwegian capital for the trial, judges will consider whether Breivik was insane at the time of the killings, and whether he should be sent to prison or a mental facility for his crimes. What is Breivik charged with? The 33-year-old Norwegian man is facing charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror. He is accused of setting off a bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people, then fatally shooting 69 people at a youth camp run by the ruling Labour Party on nearby Utoya Island on July 22, 2011. Who decides Breivik's fate? The current trial is in front of what is called the court of first instance, says Jon T. Johnsen, Professor of Law at the University of Oslo. The court has no jury, but is instead made up of two professional judges and three ""lay judges"" -- members of the public that are chosen for the case just as members of a traditional jury would be -- that have the same powers as the professional judges do. In this court of first instance, the five judges will hear Breivik's case, decide whether he is guilty or not, and if he is found guilty they will also sentence him. Breivik then has a right to appeal the decision to a higher court. If Breivik's appeal relates to the question of guilt, a court comprised of 10 jurors and moderated by three professional judges will oversee the new trial. Seven guilty votes are required to convict in an appellate court. If a guilty verdict is reached, the three professional judges will join four members of the jury to decide on sentencing. The case can then be appealed to the Supreme Court of Norway. However, the jury's evaluation of the evidence for his guilt is final. The case can then be appealed to the Supreme Court of Norway. What will happen during the trial? Breivik's trial in front of the court of first instance is expected to take up to 10 weeks. Both the prosecution and defense are expected to call dozens of witnesses to the stand, and a verdict is not expected until weeks after the trial's conclusion. The opening proceedings of the trial Monday were televised on Norwegian television, streamed around the world and beamed via video link to 17 other courthouses across the country, where many of the bereaved sat watching. Breivik was allowed to read a prepared statement in court on Tuesday, but presiding Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen ruled that his testimony would not be broadcast -- rejecting his claim that airing it was a human right. Read more: Norwegians value killer's human rights . While broadcasting from trials is usually forbidden in Norway, Johnsen says the decision is up to the professional judges of a case before the trial begins. ""I think the case is being aired because of the large public interest,"" he told CNN. ""We haven't had any comparable case like this since the age of television started."" Could Breivik be jailed for life? The court has two options if Breivik is convicted, says Johnsen, and it depends on whether the court finds he was either sane or insane at the time of the killings. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined that Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. But in a report released in April, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said Breivik was sane at the time of the killings. The decision on Breivik's sanity ultimately rests with the courts -- and while the maximum sentence for homicide or terror acts is 21 years, Johnsen says there are two ways the Norwegian courts can keep Breivik under state custody well past his initial jail sentence. If Breivik is found to be sane, the court could sentence him to the traditional 21-year prison sentence, the maximum term for a homicide or terror act conviction, but he must be released after serving that sentence. But the court could also sentence Breivik under a provision called ""preventive detention,"" which also has a maximum of 21 years but can be prolonged in five year increments after that -- which means the court can detain Breivik indefinitely after his sentence if he is found to be a continued threat to the public. If the court finds Breivik insane, he cannot be sentenced to prison or preventive detention, but can be confined to a psychiatric institution for the rest of his life, pending reviews of his mental state by the court every three years. The prosecution will argue that Breivik was insane at the time of the attack, according to CNN's Diana Magnay. A verdict of insane would allow Breivik to be placed in this involuntary psychiatric treatment, which means he will receive a sentence (of less than 21 years) that can then be extended indefinitely for three-year periods pending an evaluation of his threat to the public. The death penalty is not an option -- Norway banned the peacetime practice of it in 1905, and Johnsen says no one has been executed since roughly 20 Norwegian war criminals were put to death following World War II. Breivik's defense will try to prove he was sane at the time of the killings, his lawyers have said. Has anyone ever been jailed for life in Norway? While people may have been remanded to psychiatric wards indefinitely following crimes, Johnsen says no one has ever been detained indefinitely under preventive detention until their death because the law has only existed in its current form for roughly a decade. How likely is it Breivik will ever be freed from state custody? While it is too early to tell how people will feel about Breivik as a threat to public safety in 20 years, Johnsen believes Breivik will walk free one day if he's determined to be sane by the courts. ""I think he will get out at some point, unless it comes up that he is really insane and will be for the rest of his life,"" he told CNN. ""I don't know if he's insane -- what we know from the past is that it's not uncommon for criminals that acted from a political motivation to change their ideology and beliefs as they get older, and they think differently about the things that brought them to commit these crimes, and then their danger to society becomes reduced.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The wreckage of a Russian passenger airliner that went missing during a demonstration flight over Indonesia has been found in a mountainous area, a local official said Thursday. Ali Umri Lubis, the mayor of Bogor, in West Java, said that parts of the Sukhoi Superjet 100 that disappeared off radar screens on Wednesday had been located. But he didn't provide any information on the passengers who were on board. Rescue workers on the ground who have been searching for the plane have not yet been able to reach the wreckage. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia said in a brief televised address Thursday that there was a strong possibility that the plane had crashed into Mount Salak, a volcano south of Jakarta. The Sukhoi jet, Russia's newest civilian airliner, was carrying 42 passengers and eight Russian crew members, according to Sunaryo, an official with Sukhoi's Indonesian agent, Trimarga Rekatama. However, the number was in dispute. The Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency said only 37 of the 42 invited passengers were on board. Russian state-run news agencies reported 44 people were on the plane. The plane was on its second demonstration flight Wednesday when it lost contact with air controllers at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. ""The first demonstration flight in the morning went smoothly,"" said Sunaryo, who uses only one name. ""There were no problems."" On the second flight, the plane began making its descent but vanished from radar screens at 6,200 feet in a mountainous area. The plane lost contact with air traffic controllers at 2:12 p.m., 21 minutes after taking off, said Marsda Daryatmo, head of the search and rescue agency. Two helicopters were immediately sent out to search for the plane but had to return to their bases due to strong winds and unpredictable weather. The Sukhoi jet arrived in Jakarta as part of a demonstration tour of six Asian countries. It had been to Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and was due to visit Laos and Vietnam after Indonesia, said the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Sukhoi manufactures military aircraft and is known especially for its fighter jets. Its civilian aircraft is narrow-bodied with a dual-class cabin that can transport 100 passengers over regional routes. It flew its maiden flight in 2008. In March, a Superjet 100 operated by Russia's Aeroflot Airlines was forced to abandon its flight to Astrakhan, Russia, and return to Moscow because of problems with the undercarriage, according to RIA Novosti. A similar defect in another Aeroflot-operated Superjet 100 plane had to be fixed in Minsk in December. Russia's state-run United Aircraft Corp. said the defect did not affect passenger safety. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","NEW: Wreckage of the plane has been located, a local official says .

"(CNN) -- Monsignor William Lynn, the highest-ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse, was found guilty Friday of one count of child endangerment. He was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and a conspiracy charge to protect a priest accused of abuse. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against his co-defendant, the Rev. James Brennan, who was charged with attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy and endangering the welfare of a child. Lynn was taken into custody after Friday's verdict, when the judge revoked his bail. His lawyer, Jeffrey Lindy, derided the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing, calling it ""an unspeakable miscarriage of justice (for) a 61-year-old man with no prior record and long established ties to the community."" He is set to be sentenced August 13, court officials said, and could face up to seven years in prison for his conviction on a third-degree felony. The trial marked the first time U.S. prosecutors charged not just priests who allegedly committed abuses but church leaders for failing to stop them. Calling the verdict ""historic,"" Philadelphia District attorney R. Seth Williams said Friday's decision sends a message about potential consequences of not reporting sexual abuse. ""Many people of many generations have unclean hands when it comes to this silence,"" Williams said, adding that others could also be investigated. Terence McKiernan, who heads the advocacy website BishopAccountability.org, called the conviction ""a watershed moment in the Catholic abuse crisis."" ""Because of the Lynn verdict, bishops and church officials are now accountable. They are no longer immune from judgment and punishment,"" McKiernan said. And Marci Hamilton, a victims' rights attorney, said the jury's verdict Friday -- as well as the decision by now-defrocked priest Edward Avery to plead guilty after admitting to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old altar boy -- suggests ""the picture is now clear that the Philadelphia archdiocese permitted crimes against children."" The archdiocese issued its own statement after the verdict, though it did not mention the trial or either Lynn or Brennan by name. It did, however, insist that ""the lessons of the last year have made our Church a more vigilant guardian of our people's safety."" ""The Archdiocese of Philadelphia is on a journey of reform and renewal that requires honesty and hope,"" it said. ""We are committed to providing support and assistance to parishioners as they and the Church seek to more deeply understand sexual violence, and to create an environment that is safe and welcoming to all, including past victims."" Attorneys: Cardinal ordered memo on priests destroyed . Lynn's attorney said he felt the jury agreed there was no ""far flung conspiracy,"" though he conceded the prosecution ""scored a victory"" in securing the lone conviction -- one that made he and the monsignor ""extremely upset."" ""By finding him guilty, they're saying he helped endanger children,"" Lindy said. ""It's the last thing he wanted to do. ... I don't think he's the evil person the district attorney is making him out to be."" Bill Donahue of the Catholic League, an advocacy group devoted to challenging defamation of or discrimination against Catholics, called the verdict a defeat for overzealous prosecutors and victims advocates who he claimed had unfairly targeted church leaders. ""The witch hunt has come to an end, and those who have been clamoring for blood lost big time,"" Donahue said in a statement. ""They wanted the big prize -- they wanted to nail a high-ranking clergyman on conspiracy. ... Looks like their car ran out of gas in Philadelphia."" More than 60 witnesses and alleged clergy abuse victims testified during Lynn and Brennan's criminal trial, which began March 26 and wrapped up May 31, with jury deliberations beginning the next day. Lynn's defense team argued that their client repeatedly told higher-ups about the alleged abuse and, under strict orders from late Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, had no authority to remove priests from the ministry. Assistant District Attorney Patrick Blessington characterized Lynn's behavior as ""disgraceful,"" ""shameful"" and ""ridiculous,"" sarcastically calling him a ""hero"" who put young people in harm's way. ""He actually looked you in the eye and said he put victims first. How dare he?"" the prosecutor asked jurors during his more than 2Â½-hour closing argument. Lynn's conspiracy count related to an allegation that he schemed with Avery and other archdiocese officials to endanger children. Avery had been due to go on trial with Brennan and Lynn, but he pleaded guilty in March to a sexual assault that occurred during the 1998-99 school year. The 69-year-old was sentenced to 2Â½ to five years in prison. Brennan himself was removed from the active ministry in 2006. Two years later, he admitted that he had allowed the youngster to view pornography and sleep in the same bed with him in 1996, according to church investigators' testimony. CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","NEW: Lynn is ""extremely upset;"" his lawyer says he should be free on bond before sentencing .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The murky abduction account of an American -- who no one appeared to even know had gone missing in Iraq until he resurfaced -- is raising questions about everything from his name to the circumstances surrounding his reported kidnapping. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad announced in a statement Sunday that Randy Michael Hultz was in the compound, having been transferred there by United Nations officials the previous day. The statement described Hultz as a ""private citizen"" who was in Iraq ""on private business,"" and ""not an employee or contractor of the U.S. government."" This characterization differs sharply from that offered in a bizarre, pre-taped news conference Saturday conducted by members of a Shiite militia loyal to radical Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Reporters who had been hastily convened for the news conference, which took place outside the heavily fortified Green Zone where the U.S. Embassy is located, learned that the militia was releasing a man they said was U.S. soldier Randy Michaels. One Sadrist lawmaker said that the man had been captured in battle nine months earlier. The man, himself, did not identify himself by name though he did say he was a former soldier who was working as a civilian when he was abducted. Amid Iranian tensions, Iraq seeks alternative oil routes . A Pentagon official insisted all active duty U.S. troops have been accounted for and no civilian was recently reported missing, and even the man's ex-wife said she didn't know he had been kidnapped. A U.S. official, who had knowledge of the man and had seen the video from the al-Sadr-linked militia, identified the man as Rand Michael Hultz -- a former Army soldier who served in Iraq shortly after the 2003 invasion and later returned as an ""entrepreneur."" The account by the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the case, is supported by interviews the man gave to an Iraqi television stations in 2010 in which he identified himself as Hultz and detailed his business ventures. During Saturday's news conference, the man was wearing a U.S. military uniform and accompanied by two members of Sadr's political party. The uniform, which did not feature a rank or a last name, was devoid of unit and combat patches. The man said he had been abducted in Baghdad on June 18, 2011, by ""Yom al-Maoud under the direction of Sayyed Muqtada al-Sadr,"" also known as the Promised Day Brigade. While al-Sadr had disbanded his notorious Mehdi Army in 2008, a small group of hand-picked fighters -- known as the Promised Day Brigade -- continued attacks that primarily targeted American troops, the U.S. military has said. Hultz said he was held in various locations across the Iraqi capital by Promised Day Brigade members. ""It was explained to me that my release has been for more of humanitarian reasons and that there was no exchange involved,"" he said. Hultz also told reporters that he deployed as a soldier to Iraq in June 2003 and then ""moved to a civilian capacity."" During the news conference, the lawmakers produced what appeared to be the man's U.S. military identification card and U.S. contractor ID card. Maha al-Douri, a lawmaker and a member of the al-Sadr movement, said at the news conference that the man had been in captivity for nine months, consistent with the reported June 2011 abduction date. Al-Sadr's party was a middleman between the Promised Day Brigade and the United Nations to facilitate the man's release, according to al-Douri. The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq simply said two lawmakers -- al Douri and Quasay al-Suhail -- handed over an American citizen, who was then transferred to the U.S. Embassy. Bahaa al-Aaraji, the head of Sadr's Ahrar political bloc, said the man was ""captured in battles"" but had no further information. He called the release a goodwill gesture to the American people following the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Besides the fact the Pentagon says no U.S. troops are missing in Iraq, the website of the Defense Prisoner Of War and Missing Personnel Office on Saturday listed three Defense Department contractors as missing. Hultz was not among them. Hultz's ex-wife, Kendra Hultz, did not immediately return a CNN telephone call seeking comment. But she told The New York Times on Saturday that she knew he was in Iraq but had little contact with him and did not know what he was doing. ""He just disappeared,"" she said. Another U.S. official with knowledge of Hultz, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he returned to Iraq in 2006 as a civilian contractor. The official was not authorized to speak to the media. Sometime after returning to Iraq, Hultz moved into private business. According to a 2010 interview with al-Hurra television station, Hultz described himself as the chief economic officer of Baghdad-based SAK Commodities, an investment and financing group also known as the Sanna Al Kassir General Trading Company. SAK Commodities, according to the reports, signed a number of contracts to assist the Ministry of Housing and Construction and construction firms to build houses and other buildings. As CEO, Hultz met with some of Iraq's powerful political players, including former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Photos of the two men and details of a March 2010 meeting in Baghdad were posted online by various business news groups. The SAK Commodities website was unavailable Sunday afternoon, and the Baghdad telephone numbers associated with its various online press releases were either disconnected or went unanswered. As to Hultz, by Sunday he'd been provided ""all necessary consular services, including a medical check-up and debriefing,"" according to the U.S. Embassy. Diplomats were helping Hultz ""as he considers his plans."" ""The Embassy reminds all private American citizens living and working in Iraq to register with the Embassy at travel.state.gov and to pay heed to the Iraq country-specific information, including the current travel warning for Iraq,"" the U.S. government said in its statement. Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad and Carter reported from Atlanta; Journalist Mohammed Lazem and CNN's Gregory Clary and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Randy Michael Hultz is at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, after being handed over .

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Jerry Sandusky's wife told jurors Tuesday that she could remember at least six of her husband's accusers staying overnight at their house. She said she did not witness any sexual abuse. One of the accusers had once traveled with them to the Alamo Bowl, Dottie Sandusky said, where she and her husband shared a hotel room with the boy. Many of the accusers testified that they knew Dottie Sandusky, who is not accused of having witnessed sexual abuse. She testified that children would often sleep at the Sanduskys' house and that ""we would give them a choice of where they wanted to sleep."" Her husband was also typically the one to put the children to sleep, she said, telling jurors that ""he would go downstairs and tell them good night."" Meanwhile, Jerry Sandusky's attorney told reporters Tuesday to ""stay tuned"" to see if his client will testify in a child rape case that has upended Penn State University and its football program. ""You have to wait,"" attorney Joe Amendola said just before entering the Pennsylvania courthouse and calling witnesses for a second day. Sandusky, 68, is on trial on 51 counts related to accusations of sexually abusing 10 boys over a 15-year span. The former Penn State defensive coordinator has denied the charges. Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know . Questions about Sandusky's mental health continue to loom over the proceedings. Dr. Elliot Atkins testified that he had diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder after interviewing the former coach. But a second psychologist, Dr. John O'Brien, disputed those findings Tuesday, saying that the ""personality profile Mr. Sandusky exhibited was within normal limits."" The prosecution had earlier presented as evidence what one accuser described as ""creepy love letters,"" written by Sandusky. They argued the letters were part of ""grooming techniques"" commonly employed by sexual predators. Judge John Cleland issued an order Friday allowing a defense motion to offer expert testimony from a psychologist who ""will explain that the words, tones, requests and statements made in the letters are consistent with a person who suffers from a histrionic personality disorder."" ""The goal of a person suffering from this disorder in writing those letters would not necessarily be to groom or sexually consummate a relationship in a criminal manner, but rather to satisfy the needs of a psyche belabored by the needs of such a disorder,"" the defense lawyers wrote in their motion. Histrionic personality disorder is part of a class of conditions called dramatic personality disorders, which are marked by unstable emotions and distorted self-images, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Separately, after being subpoenaed by prosecutors, NBC News provided court officials with transcripts and footage of a Bob Costas interview with the former coach, according to NBC spokeswoman Amy Lynn. ""I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped,"" the former coach told the NBC sportscaster in an interview segment that wasn't part of the November 2011 broadcast, but has since been aired. Sandusky said there are likely ""many young people who would come forward and say that my methods and what I had done for them made a very positive impact on their life."" If the former coach testifies, those comments could potentially be entered as new evidence. Early in the trial, Amendola implied that Sandusky would take the stand. Closing arguments could begin as soon as Thursday, with the defense expected to end its case midday Wednesday, followed by the prosecution's rebuttal. Sandusky routinely ""got showers with kids"" after working out, and he would say so later, Amendola said Monday. But as the trial nears its end, it remains unclear if Sandusky will speak. Ron Kuby, a veteran criminal defense attorney, said there has been a ""tsunami of evidence against him"" and suggested that the former coach should take the stand. Sandusky's child sex abuse allegations: In his own words . ""Just maybe he can convince one juror to hold out,"" the lawyer said. ""A hung jury, right now, is a lot better than life without parole."" Prosecutors wrapped up their case Monday morning with brief testimony from the mother of one of the alleged victims. ""He gave him clothes, he gave him gifts,"" the mother of an accuser called Victim 9 testified. ""I just wish he'd given him underwear to replace the underwear I could never find in my laundry."" The final prosecution witness testified Monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the times he was visiting Sandusky and sometimes did not want to visit the former Penn State assistant's home. But she said she didn't ask him about any possible abuse and still does not know what happened to him. ""I didn't really want to hear,"" she said, crying. The defense then opened its case with a former Penn State coach who testified about Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community. Richard Anderson said it was not uncommon for coaches and youths to use the shower at the same time, and that he had never seen anything inappropriate between Sandusky and a child. The defense called five other witnesses who also said Sandusky had a stellar reputation in the community. A main focus of the defense's strategy may be to attempt to poke holes in the prosecution's case thus far. ""A lot of people lied,"" Amendola said last Monday in his opening statement. Over four days, several people testified that Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts with him in various places, including showers in the Penn State coaches' locker room, hotel rooms and the basement of his home. 'Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation, betrayal . One told jurors that Sandusky -- whom he met, like many of the accusers, through the Second Mile nonprofit for disadvantaged youths that the ex-coach founded -- had threatened him if he told others about the abuse. Another said Sandusky warned he might send him home from a trip to Texas, where they'd gone to watch a Penn State bowl game. The defense could challenge the accusers' timetable, questioning if Sandusky could have committed the crimes they claim he did when they say he did. What is histrionic personality disorder? On Monday, prosecutors dropped one of the 52 counts against Sandusky because the statute he was charged with wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident. The accuser said the incident occurred in 1995 or 1996, but the unlawful contact with a minor statute didn't apply until 1997. CNN's Dana Garrett, Laura Dolan and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","One accuser also stayed in their hotel room during Alamo Bowl, Dottie Sandusky tells jury .

"(CNN) -- In New Zealand, it's being called ""Marmageddon."" The island nation is facing a dwindling stock of the beloved Marmite spread after recent earthquakes in Christchurch forced the manufacturer to shut down the only factory producing the stuff. A spokesman for Sanitarium, the maker of the salty breakfast spread, says it has now run out of Marmite and it can't make any more until July at the earliest. That's caused a run on Marmite at markets all around New Zealand -- and reports of panic among customers who love the spread. Sanitarium general manager Pierre van Heerden said people should face the hard fact that they'll need to conserve their Marmite and could try spreading it on toast rather than slices of bread out of the bag to make it last. The company made the announcement Monday and has been surprised by the outpouring of concern. ""Supplies are starting to run out nationwide, and across the ditch in Australia,"" it posted on its website. ""Don't freak. We will be back soon!"" The Countdown supermarket chain said that it has two to three weeks' supply on hand under normal conditions. ""We haven't seen any noticeable bulk-buying of Marmite as yet, but will not be enforcing a purchase limit,"" Murray Johnston, general manager for merchandise for Countdown's parent Progressive Enterprises, told CNN. Statements like that might also be sparking a speculative Marmite rush. Bidders at online auction site TradeMe were willing to pay up to $60 New Zealand dollars ($50 U.S.) for a bottle, with some touting the thick paste as ""Black Gold"" in their listings. One enterprising would-be Marmite miser was asking for $799 for a package, while others were trying to sell off half-empty containers as ""emergency stashes."" Van Heerden says that he's not worried about Marmite fans defecting to rival Vegemite, from Kraft Foods in Australia. ""The differences between Vegemite and Marmite are quite significant,"" he said. ""People have really strong feelings about the taste and a love-or-hate relationship with them."" He adds that he's not overly concerned about losing market share despite the prospect of being off the shelves for several months. ""We have a strong consumer base, and most are saying they will wait for us to come back with knives at the ready,"" van Heerden said.","Earthquakes knock out New Zealand's only source of Marmite .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen attacked Christians worshipping on a Nigerian university campus on Sunday, with witnesses reporting multiple explosions and gunfire. The number of casualties was not immediately clear. Professor A.B. Baffa said he was at home on the campus of Bayero University in the city of Kano when he heard the gunfire and explosions. When he went to see what was going on, he said he saw people fleeing and saying gunmen attacked areas where Christians were worshipping. The gunmen began their attack around 8:30 a.m., targeting a lecture hall normally used by Christians for Sunday services, journalist Salihu Tanko reported from the scene. ""Reports say that they came in one vehicle and they also came on the bike and started shooting sporadically and at the same time threw about four or five small locally made bombs,"" Tanko reported. Baffa said police have closed off the area. The attack happened while the university is on a break, so most of the students are not on campus, Tanko said. Britain's Foreign Office said it had received reports of an explosion and gunfire at Bayero University and that the incident may be ongoing.

Twenty-nine people were killed and others were injured in January when a fire broke out at another rehabilitation center in Lima, according to Andina. Some 40 people were housed in a small space with only one exit that was locked with a chain, the news agency reported at the time, citing a fire official.

"(CNN) -- There's a new polar bear on the block -- meet Anori, half-sister to Knut, who made her public debut this week at Wuppertal Zoo in Germany. Small, fluffy and cute, she wandered out into a small outdoor enclosure with her mother, Vilma, for the first time Thursday to meet her audience. Anori, born on January 4, opened her eyes at a month old, the zoo says. Since then, she has worked on mastering the tricky arts of walking and climbing, with her efforts captured by a surveillance camera placed within the bears' den. Video footage from the outdoor enclosure shows the cub clambering tentatively along a log. Anori shares a father with Knut, the cub who became an Internet star after he was abandoned by his mother and hand-raised by a zookeeper. Knut died suddenly at age 4 in March 2010 at Zoo Berlin, to the sorrow of many worldwide who had followed the cub's progress. A second cub was born with Anori in January but died a week later, the zoo said. Wuppertal Zoo has a long history of raising polar bears, with the first cub born there in 1931, the zoo's website says. Scientists believe there could be as few as 25,000 polar bears left in the world, according to Polar Bears International, a conservation group. In 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.","Anori was born in January and opened her eyes a month later .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Interpol on Tuesday issued a ""red notice"" for Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is suspected of guiding and financing terrorist attacks in the country. The red notice for al-Hashimi ""represents a regional (and) international alert to all of Interpol's 190 member countries to seek their help in locating and arresting him, following the issue of a national arrest warrant by Iraq's Judicial Investigative Authority as part of an investigation in which security forces seized bombing materials and arrested individuals,"" the international police organization said in a statement. Al-Hashimi has been living in a Turkish government guest house in Istanbul. In recent months, he has lived in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region but has also traveled to Saudi Arabia and Qatar at the invitation of those governments. Al-Hashimi visits Qatar despite travel ban . He said Tuesday he should be presumed innocent. ""Everybody knows that my case is a political case, from beginning to end, and that the charges against me are fabricated, and far from the truth,"" al-Hashimi said in a statement. ""It is now well-known that there are many cases in Iraq, that the provisions were based on confessions extracted under duress."" Reached by telephone Tuesday in Istanbul, one of al-Hashimi's aides, Mehmet Bulovali, told CNN, ""This is a warning, not an arrest warrant."" Iraq's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish political leaders have squared off over the December arrest warrant for al-Hashimi, Iraq's top Sunni political figure. In a January interview with CNN, al-Hashimi accused Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite, of pushing the country toward a deep sectarian divide. Al-Hashimi predicts return to sectarian violence . In February, Iraq's top judicial committee accused al-Hashimi's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians from 2005 to 2011. Al-Hashimi said the nine-judge council was under the control of the Shiite-dominated central government and has denied the charges, calling them ""politically motivated."" Charges against al-Hashimi appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men, identified as the vice president's security guards. Iraqi state television aired video of the confessions in December, but CNN has not been able to verify the men's identities independently. A red notice is not an international arrest warrant, but many Interpol member countries consider the alert to be a valid request for provisional arrest, the agency said. Interpol cannot demand that any member country arrest the subject of a red notice. The police organization has been criticized in the past for allowing some nations to use such notices to target political opponents. As an official guest of the Turkish government, al-Hashimi has been granted a meeting with Turkey's prime minister. In recent months, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has engaged in a war of words with al-Maliki. Officials from the Turkish government were not immediately available for comment on whether Turkey would comply with the red notice. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Mohammed Jamjoom, Saad Abedine, Hamdi Alkhshali, Ivan Watson and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","Vice President Tariq Al-Hashimi says charges against him are fabricated .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Wildcat miners in southeast Peru called off a week-old protest Thursday, a day after three people were killed in clashes with police. Leaders called off demonstrations and agreed to meet with Peruvian officials Monday, Peru's state-run Andina news agency reported. ""We are open to discussions ... and we will search for a solution,"" union leader Luis Otzuka said, according to Andina. Miners in the country's Madre de Dios region have been demonstrating ahead of the enforcement of several decrees aimed at cracking down on illegal mining. The protesters tried to take over an airport, a bridge and a market Wednesday. Police pushed them back with tear gas and warning shots from their rifles. Protesters rained rocks on the riot police. The government blamed the protesters' actions for igniting the clashes that led to the deaths of Carlos Lanci Yumbato, 46; Julio Ticona Medina, 31; and Francisco Areque Jipa, 35. According to the government, another 38 civilians and 17 police officers were injured. At least 60 people were arrested. ""The government of Peru rejects the acts of violence by the illegal miners in Madre de Dios and asks the regional authorities and the general public to support the work of the police to re-establish order and peace in that jurisdiction,"" the government said in a statement. President Ollanta Humala's Cabinet chief, Oscar Valdes, said Thursday that the government remains firm on its intention to regulate the informal mining sector. There are thousands of wildcat miners in Peru. The new decrees would impose sentences of as much as 10 years for operating illegal mines. Other informal mines must meet certain environmental standards or be abandoned. Valdes said the issue is important because illegal mining has negative consequences such as child slavery, deforestation, drug trafficking and mistreatment of workers. The new decrees also have the support of union leaders in the formal mining sector. The president of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, Carmela Siguentes, said that formalizing the illegal miners would guarantee their right to a fair wage and provide an escape from exploitation by ""mafias."" But the protesters say that the new decrees will deny them their right to work. Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this report.","NEW: Demonstrators call off protests and say they will meet with government officials .

"(CNN) -- Alabama lawmakers passed a new bill Wednesday aimed at improving the state's controversial immigration law, but critics said the new measure might make things worse. Demonstrators protested outside the chambers of the Alabama state House and Senate. Seven of them were arrested, said Justin Cox, staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants Rights Project. The Southern Poverty Law Center's legal director was among those arrested, said Marion Steinfels, a representative of the organization. Police could not be immediately reached for comment. The center is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit against Alabama's immigration law. The new immigration bill, known as HB 658, was approved by the state House and Senate Wednesday. The state's governor will have the final say, with the power to sign the bill into law or veto it. ""We will conduct a final review of the legislation as passed and make a final decision from there,"" said Jeremy King, a spokesman for Gov. Robert Bentley. ""Governor Bentley's goal is to emerge with an immigration bill that is simplified, clarified, more effective, and more enforceable."" Alabama Sen. Dick Brewbaker told CNN that the new bill addresses unintended consequences of the state's immigration law, including clarifying the types of documents that can serve as a form of official identification. It does not address parts of the law that are at issue in federal courts, he said. Critics say parts of the new measure would be even harsher than last year's immigration law, which is known as the toughest in the nation. ""The new bill preserves most of the law while adding several positions that make it even more dangerous,"" the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice said in a statement. Cox, of the ACLU, said the biggest problem of the new bill was the requirement that the Alabama Department of Homeland Security post online the names of illegal immigrants that appear in state courts. The coalition said that provision ""amounts to a 'scarlet letter' provision likely to lead to harassment and vigilantism."" The new measure also includes a provision that allows someone to be detained for up to 48 hours while authorities determine their immigration status. ""Alabama took a step backward in approving this ill-conceived measure,"" said Olivia Turner, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. ""Lawmakers were deaf to the concerns of many residents, business owners and police who realize this law is a bad idea. Alabama will continue to pay a severe price for a law that is almost impossible to enforce properly and blatantly unconstitutional."" House lawmakers voted 68-37 in favor of the Senate's version of the bill Wednesday night. Before the vote, several representatives appeared skeptical about the Senate version of the bill. House lawmakers approved a different version of the bill last month. Rep. Napoleon Bracy Jr. criticized senators for the proposal, calling it ""a totally different bill that no one has had a chance to read that's full of unintended consequences."" Other lawmakers worried that the measure would negatively affect the state's economy, and expressed concerns about racial profiling. But lawmakers backing the bill said it protects the state's residents and helps its economy. Alabama's existing law, known as HB 56, has several provisions, including one requiring police who make lawful traffic stops or arrests to try to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally. A federal appeals court has blocked some components, however, including one requiring Alabama officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools. The Alabama law is one of a number of several state laws aiming to crack down on illegal immigration, and has become part of a nationwide skirmish between state federal officials over who controls immigration enforcement. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments over Arizona's similar immigration measure. A ruling could come in late June, just before the justices recess for the summer.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 400 people were killed overnight Saturday by government shelling in what is supposed to be a ""no-fire"" zone of Sri Lanka, a humanitarian worker in the area told CNN on Sunday. A photo supplied by a humanitarian group on Sunday shows civilians allegedly injured in government shelling. Most of the roughly 378 dead are civilians, and another 1,200 were wounded, the aid worker said. Video sent to CNN by the pro-Tamil rebel pressure group ACT Now appeared to show dead and wounded civilians. The group says the video was taken Sunday in the ""no-fire"" zone. Another humanitarian group also supplied photos of casualties to CNN. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of either the video or the photos. CNN is not naming the humanitarian sources in the conflict zone to protect their safety. The government denies the assertion it shelled the ""no-fire"" zone, saying it is the Tamil Tiger rebels who have been killing civilians. Tamil Tiger ""attacks using heavy weapons in the no-fire zone have caused immense damage to the civilians entrapped in the area,"" the government information department said, quoting the military. But the military did say it had advanced Saturday into areas previously held by the rebels, officially known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. ""The troops attached to the Air Mobile Brigade further advanced into the 'No Fire Zone' capturing LTTE strong positions in general area Karaiyamullivaikal yesterday,"" military sources said, according to the government's news Web site. ""The LTTE terrorists have laid land mines heavily in the area to obstruct the security forces' advance and a number of LTTE terrorists were killed during fighting while many wounded,"" the government site said. The pro-rebel Web site Tamilnet said rescue workers in the no-fire zone ""have counted more than 1,200 bodies"" and accused the army of ""the use of cluster ammunition, multi-barrel rocket launchers and cannons. ""The workers fear that there may be additional bodies yet to be uncovered, and the numbers killed will likely rise,"" the pro-rebel site said. Aid workers in the country said the situation is worsening and the next few days are ""absolutely critical."" About 165,000 displaced people are in the Vavuniya region, where the United Nations and other humanitarian groups are trying to get relief to them, an aid group said. Meanwhile, a British news team that had been detained by Sri Lankan authorities -- after producing a report about the alleged abuse of Tamils -- has left the country, news managers said Sunday. The Channel 4 news team, which was detained on Saturday, is heading back to its base in Bangkok, Thailand, ITN senior news management said. ITN produces Channel 4's news programs.  Watch journalist explain what angered government » . The team's news report, which aired Tuesday, chronicled the abuse of Tamils in internment camps in the city of Vavuniya in northern Sri Lanka. The report contained claims of bodies being left where they fell, shortages of food and water, and instances of sexual abuse. The government denied the claims and arrested Channel 4 Asia correspondent Nick Paton-Walsh, a cameraman and a producer. The Sri Lankan military has been on an offensive to try to finish off the ethnic Tamil insurgency that has been fighting since 1983 for an independent state in the northeast of the country. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by the European Union and more than 30 countries, including the United States. Tamil Tiger rebels have been pinned down by Sri Lankan government troops in a small section of the country's north, and civilians trapped in the crossfire have been trying to flee.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new incident inflaming tensions between the United States and Afghanistan -- this time the alleged massacre of 16 Afghan civilians by a U.S. soldier -- calls into question the chances for stability as the U.S.-led military mission shifts security responsibility to Afghan forces in coming months. Sunday's shootings in Kandahar province followed a series of events that already had sparked anger and distrust between the Afghan and U.S. governments, including the burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers that led to a violent backlash, including attacks that killed U.S. service members. Now the concern is that an atrocity apparently carried out by a lone American soldier will heighten anti-U.S. sentiments among a civilian population that is key to a successful counterinsurgency strategy against the Taliban. Suspect suffered brain injury in 2010, Pentagon official says . Analysts and U.S. officials said Monday they believe the transition under way -- which seeks to end the American-led military mission in 2014 -- will remain on track, though the process may be more difficult. ""There is still no better option and the Afghans still aren't ready to handle their problems without us, and I think they know that,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution, in an e-mail to CNN. Seth Jones, a senior political scientist at the non-partisan Rand Corporation research organization, said the Sunday incident ""certainly adds to tension between the U.S. and the Afghans, but I don't believe this is a tipping point."" In the end, Jones told CNN, a key issue is whether local Afghan clans and sub-tribes will continue to work with U.S. and Afghan forces as part of the transition process. ""If it becomes clear in multiple regions that they would prefer a smaller U.S. role, especially one not in the lead, I do think that means transitioning to an Afghan lead faster,"" Jones said. Calls to hasten the transition in Afghanistan had increased at home before Sunday's shootings. Last week, two dozen U.S. senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- sent a letter to President Barack Obama that argued for a faster handover of security responsibility to Afghan forces so that U.S. combat forces could come home. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada reacted to Sunday's shooting by adding to the calls for bringing U.S. troops home from Afghanistan as soon as possible, while Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich said the entire Afghanistan mission needs to be reassessed. The Obama administration insisted Monday that the civilian killings, while tragic and horrific, would not change the goals or timing of the U.S. strategy to defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and turn over security responsibility to Afghan forces. ""This is a challenging time, there's no question,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday. ""I do not believe that this incident will change the timetable of a strategy that was designed and is being implemented to allow for the withdrawal of U.S. forces."" Carney noted that in the aftermath of the recent violent backlash in Afghanistan after the Quran burnings by U.S. troops, the two nations were able to complete a long-negotiated memorandum of understanding on the transfer of detainees. Also Monday, the Pentagon called the mass shooting in Afghanistan ""an isolated incident,"" and spokesman George Little said the overall mission there remains the same. ""Despite what some are saying, we are not changing our fundamental strategy,"" Little said. In addition, he said, recent polls that show a lack of American support for the war will not affect the strategy. O'Hanlon, of the Brookings Institution, said fallout from the Sunday shooting could harm efforts to negotiate a long-term strategic partnership with Afghanistan intended to maintain U.S. support after the end of the formal military mission. So far, those talks have been ""impeded by impasses over issues such as NATO night raids and civilian casualties,"" O'Hanlon added. Jones, the Rand Corporation analyst, said news of Sunday's attack was sure to travel quickly throughout Afghanistan, spread by mullahs in mosques, word-of-mouth and radio. The government will likely depict the incident as the latest of many atrocities by both sides, noting Taliban killings of civilians, while the Taliban will try to portray it as another example of U .S. aggression, Jones added. In Afghanistan on Monday, the Taliban called U.S. forces ""sick-minded American savages,"" warning in an online statement that the group would mete out punishment for their ""barbaric actions."" President Hamid Karzai labeled the attack an ""unforgivable"" crime, and people in the area of the killings were angry at both Americans and Afghan security forces, whom they accuse of failing to protect them, villager Muhammad Wali said. ""The people in these villages are scared, and we don't know what is going to happen next. ... They saw nothing except the Americans going and killing them in their homes,"" Wali said. To Jones, the greatest anger will come from ""the specific sub tribes and clans themselves where they lost villagers."" ""I think this will require some time to shake out,"" he said, adding that the full impact of the attack won't be known until the view of the Afghan population becomes more clear. Only if the Afghan government and the Afghan people want to quicken the pace of the U.S. withdrawal will that happen, Jones said, adding: ""It shouldn't be based on one incident."" CNN's Chris Lawrence and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","Another atrocity heightens anti-U.S. sentiments in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- On the day one of two suspects in his wife's death was arraigned, a deployed Marine said Thursday he was devastated but wanted to ensure her death was not in vain. ""My wife, Brittany, was beautiful beyond words and her murder has left me devastated. My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the person or persons who took her away from me,"" Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore said in a statement. Marine Staff Sgt. Luis Ray Perez, 45, was arraigned on a suspicion of murder charge in San Diego County, California, in the death of Brittany Killgore, 22. He pleaded not guilty, according to CNN affiliate KGTV. Perez was with Brittany Killgore on April 13, the last time she was seen alive, according to authorities. Brittany Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, investigators said. He was granted an emergency leave to return to the United States when he learned his wife was missing. ""Brittany's death cannot be in vain -- at this point, I don't know how to use this tragedy for good, but others have found their way and I hope to do the same,"" Cory Killgore said. Prosecutors said the victim was to go out to San Diego's Gaslamp quarter with Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton, and a female friend, who decided not to go. ""Brittany sent a text message, in distress, asking for help, shortly after the point in time when Mr. Perez was with her,"" Deputy District Attorney Patrick Espinoza told KGTV. Perez was questioned after a friend filed a missing person report for Killgore, officials said. He was charged last week with two felonies unrelated to Killgore's death, receiving stolen property and possession of an assault weapon, and he has pleaded not guilty, authorities said. Authorities last week charged Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, with first-degree murder in connection with Killgore's death. She has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Lopez would face 25 years to life in prison. Investigators on April 17 found Killgore's body in a rural part of neighboring Riverside County. Authorities have not said how she died or what they believe links the suspects with her death. Lopez's relationship to Killgore has been unclear. KGTV in San Diego reported that authorities found Killgore's body based on leads stemming from Lopez's arrest.","Marine sergeant pleads not guilty in woman's death .

"(CNN) -- Former England and Mexico coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has been appointed as coach of the Ivory Coast national team for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Eriksson led England to the quarterfinals of both the 2002 and 2006 World Cup finals but had a less successful spell with Mexico, and was sacked from that post in April last year. The Swede was recently director of football at lower league English side Notts County, but left that position when the club ran into financial difficulties. The appointment of Eriksson was announced live on national television on Sunday evening by Souleymane Alex Bamba, a member of Ivory Coast's Football Federation. The news came exactly a month after previous coach Vahid Halilhodzic was dismissed -- also on live television. A statement released by the Ivory Coast Football Federation (FIF) later read:  ""Aware of the great expectations of our population who have taken a keen interest in the matter, the executive committee focused its choice on Mr Sven-Goran Eriksson. ""The Swede has been, among others, coach of England and Mexico. He is an experienced technician who has been proven.

Spanair ""announced that it has ceased its operations, and thus, it has suspended all its flights from 2 a.m. Saturday (8 p.m. ET Friday),"" Spanish airport operator AENA said on its website. The airline said its last flight had landed at 10 p.m. Friday. ""Because of a lack of visible financing in the next couple of months, the company has chosen to cease the operation of its flights as a prudent and secure measure, and it will now take all legal pertinent measures,"" Spanair said in a statement. ""The management of Spanair is sorry and apologizes to all those who are affected by this situation."" A spokeswoman at Madrid's Barajas Airport said there were not large numbers of stranded passengers there, and that other airlines have been able to get passengers on to other flights. A spokesman for Barcelona's El Prat airport said about 20 Spanair planes were sitting on the tarmac at the old terminal. Normally there would have been 27 outbound Spanair flights from the airport Saturday, and passengers on 15 of them have been able to get other flights with other companies, the spokesman said. The airport has received 105 complaints from passengers wanting their money back, he said. A special area has been set up at the airport where Spanair passengers have been able to get help but they have not been gathering in large numbers, he said. Spanair, which is headquartered in Barcelona, said those who were due to fly with it should get in touch via phone or its website for more information. Spanish airline Iberia, the country's largest, said it was working closely with local and national authorities to draw up measures to ease the situation. Iberia ""has implemented a contingency plan, deploying a large team that is now working intensely to help resolve this situation on the best possible terms for Spanair customers."" The measures include special fares for flights over the next week. The airline may also lay on extra flights to cope with extra demand on certain routes, it said. The Catalan authorities said Vueling and Air Europa would also offer special fares and additional flights to help Spainair customers. Scandanavian airline SAS, which used to own Spanair and still has a partial share in it, said its results would be down by about $252 million as a result of the airline's bankruptcy. CNN's Al Goodman reported from Madrid and Per Nyberg from London.","The last Spanair flight landed on Friday evening .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona notched up the pressure on La Liga leaders Real Madrid with a 4-0 home win over Getafe as Alexis Sanchez scored twice on the day that the Spanish club's defender Eric Abidal had a liver transplant. Tuesday's victory left the defending champions a single point behind their archrivals, who face a testing derby match at Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. It was Barcelona's 10th straight league win, and put Josep Guardiola equal second on the club's all-time La Liga victories list with 112 as coach, matching Frank Rijkaard. Johan Cruyff has the record of 183 wins from 306 games as coach, but Guardiola has the highest winning percentage of 76.8% from 146 league outings, losing only 10 times in four seasons. Guardiola dedicated the victory to Abidal, who had his surgery about a year after having a tumor removed from the same organ.. ""We're very pleased to be able to dedicate this victory to Abidal and his cousin Gerard. It's a special day because we knew that he was in surgery,"" Guardiola said. ""We're very pleased because it's never easy against such a defensive team. We found our patience, and we scored fairly early, we created goalscoring chances ... we controlled the match. It's very difficult to attack a team that defends with nine players."" Sanchez opened the scoring in the 13th minute after being put through by Lionel Messi. Argentina star Messi got on the scoresheet himself just before halftime with Chile forward Sanchez adding his second in the 73rd minute, while Pedro rounded off the scoring a minute later to complete the rout. Supporters in the Nou Camp paid a special tribute to the 32-year-old Abidal in the 22nd minute of the match -- the same number as his squad shirt. Barcelona announced on March 15 that Abidal would have a liver transplant ""in the coming weeks."" Last year he made a remarkable recovery from his cancer removal and helped Barcelona lift the European Champions League trophy after beating Manchester United in the final. The France international had made 20 appearances for Barcelona this season before news emerged of his impending operation. In Tuesday's other action, Osasuna consolidated sixth place with a 2-0 win over Espanyol that lifted the Pamplona-based club four points clear of their opponents and Atletico. Real Sociedad drew 1-1 at home to Real Betis, a result which left both teams comfortably clear of the relegation zone.","Barcelona beat Getafe 4-0 in the Nou Camp in La Liga match .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer representing two Palestinian prisoners entering the 70th day of a hunger strike said his clients were nearing death and accused an Israeli high court of procrastination in delivering a ruling that could save their lives. ""Their medical condition has gone from very bad to extremely worse,"" Jamil al-Khatib said of clients Bilal Diab, 27, and Tha'er Halahlah, 33, . ""I believe what the court is doing here is trying to break the will of both prisoners so they will back down in their hunger strike."" Palestinians protest detention policy . Diab and Thaer are among the estimated 1,600 to 2,000 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons staging a mass hunger strike to protest prison conditions and the practice of administrative detention, a controversial Israeli military practice that allows authorities to detain people indefinitely. The process also allows for detention based on secret evidence, and there is no requirement to charge the detainees or to allow them to stand trial. Diab and Halahlah, members of the Gaza-based militant group Islamic Jihad, have been in custody for nine months and 22 months, respectively, under administrative detention. An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor, told CNN that both men ""were arrested for their direct involvement in promoting terror"" and suggested that administrative detention constituted ""the only available means to thwart the danger"" the men posed to Israel. Looking pale and weak, both men appeared in wheelchairs before the Israeli high court Thursday while their lawyers petitioned the judges that they be released, arguing that their continued detention was illegal and that their deteriorating medical conditions should be taken into consideration. The court was expected to rule on the matter Sunday, but no decision was forthcoming. Amany Daify, a project coordinator for Physicians for Human Rights, an Israeli group advocating on behalf of the hunger striking prisoners, said both prisoners ""are in a life-threatening condition"" and continued to refuse to be given minerals or liquids. ""There is no documented history of any person who survived without food or supplements beyond 75 days,"" Daify said. According to a spokeswoman for the Israeli Prison Service, Diab is being held at an Israeli hospital while Halahlah is being cared for at prison medical facility. More than 4,500 Palestinian prisoners are in Israeli prisons for a variety of offenses, ranging from rock-throwing to murder. Of these, about 300 are being held in administrative detention, according to rights groups. The vast majority of prisoners refusing to eat began their protest on April 17, while a handful have been without food for longer. While hunger strikes are not a new tactic of Palestinian resistance, a series of recent and high-profile cases have brought increased attention to the practice and served as a rallying cry for Palestinians, who have staged multiple protests in the West Bank and Gaza in support of prisoners.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Bad news for Black Sabbath fans: Bill Ward will not be playing drums at any of the group's three gigs scheduled this year. In a long message posted on his website, Ward explained that he was simply not able to come to terms with his bandmates. The metal pioneers are playing their first show since 2005 this Saturday evening at their hometown of Birmingham, England -- and Ward claims that he first learned of the gig through an ad on the Internet. The original Sabbath lineup announced last November that they would reunite for a tour and their first album since 1978's ""Never Say Die!"" Less than two months later, guitarist Tony Iommi was diagnosed with lymphoma, prompting Sabbath to cancel the vast majority of their summer tour. Weeks later, Bill Ward announced via a Facebook that he would not participate in the group's reunion until he was presented with a ""signable contract."" The group vowed to carry on without him and had recently announced a headlining gig at Lollapalooza, as well as a warm-up show in Birmingham this Saturday. In his new letter, Ward says that the group asked him to play drums on three songs during their set at the Download Festival in June, an offer that he refused. On May 9, Ward says, Sabbath asked him to play this Saturday's gig for free without any guarantee that he'd get to perform at the other shows, which he ultimately turned down. Here is the complete text of Ward's letter: . ""Dear Sabbath Fans and Fellow Musicians, . I sincerely regret to inform you that after a final effort to participate in the upcoming Sabbath shows a failure to agree has continued. At this time I have to inform you that I won't be playing with Black Sabbath at the Birmingham gig dated May 19, 2012, nor will I be playing at Download on June 10, 2012. Further, I will not be playing at Lollapalooza on August 3, 2012. It is with a very sad heart that I bring you this news. I am sincerely passionate in my desire to play with the band, and I'm very, very sorry that it's fallen to this. This statement is even more painstaking to write, as I was particularly excited to play alongside Tony Iommi after the recent treatments he underwent. I wanted that to become a reality. To express my thoughts about you, the Sabbath fans, I'm going to speak to you all through an experience my brother James had recently. My brother Jimmy lives in the U.K. When speaking with him a couple of days ago, he told me that an acquaintance had stopped him on the street and confronted him, 'Is your brother playing Birmingham? What's going on? I waited in line with my son and paid x amount for the concert tickets.' The man's son is a young drummer. He's going to see Sabbath, and he wants to see Bill Ward play drums. Upon hearing this news, I felt horrible. I couldn't help feeling some resentment towards the failure to reach an agreement, the failure to remember where we came from, the failure to be as brothers, as we once were. To be clear, I'm not blaming the other guys or finding any faults with them. I would think it can't be easy for them either, but this situation is just really sad. It's sad that it's come to this. 'This' will surely leave a mark and be unwelcome to the memory. Hopefully 'this' will heal and pass in time. My heart sank when Jimmy told me about this young boy. I know this boy is going to be disappointed, and I don't know how to amend it, other than to put my arms around the boy and tell him I love him. Sabbath fans have a voice and a face, to me you're human, you have families and despair. You have ferocity and emotions and graciousness, and at this moment as far as I'm concerned you are also that young boy in England. I don't know how to amend my part in these failings other than to put my arms around you and say I love you and let you know I'm very, very sorry. Throughout this process, which began over a year ago, I have had to stand up for myself time and time again. I have had to stand up for myself and in doing so realize my actions indirectly, although unintentionally, are upsetting and hurting a lot of you. I know in my heart I couldn't have done these concerts by agreeing the terms suggested. I made a solemn vow after the last European and Ozzfest concerts that I would never again enter into what was, in my opinion, a totally unsatisfactory contract. I have to stand for something, and as painful as it is, I'm doing it. Earlier in April 2012, I'd been asked to participate 'minimally' in the Download festival. I believe I'd been offered no more than three songs to play while another drummer presumably played the rest of the show with Black Sabbath. I was not willing to participate in that offer. I was not prepared to watch another drummer play a Sabbath set, while I was to play only three songs. I found out about the Birmingham gig on Monday, April 30 through the Internet ad. I was taken aback somewhat by the date, and the fact it was Birmingham. Knowing the ""signable"" contract negotiations were at best in shreds, I was upset by the idea that the band was going to play Birmingham and play it assumedly without me. I had no prior knowledge of the date and location, and I felt totally excluded. We contacted the representative for Black Sabbath to see if something could be worked out. In the meantime my drum crew and I, along with our US endorsers, finished all the necessary planning for a swift departure to the UK. There wasn't a whole lot to complete; we'd all been on standby more or less since mid-January 2012. The remaining work in the UK was confirmed done by our European and UK endorsers and we were good to go by Friday, May 4 2012. There were two stress points: firstly, getting an agreement in place, and secondly, getting to England in a timely manner. Jetlag time was taken into account as well as drum practice, a drum practice room in the heart of Birmingham, accommodation, and travel arrangements were all in place to meet with any band rehearsals that may have transpired before the Birmingham show. So far everything that had been arranged was on my dime, but we didn't move ahead without a realistic confirmation. Communications between the representative and my lawyer continued through the weekend of May 5 finalizing on Wednesday, May 9. The offer we received on May 9 was, 'come to the U.K., play for free and see how the first show goes.' I was tempted. Playing for free would not have been a problem for me, but 'seeing how the first show goes' left an element of risk which could have affected Download. My ideal thought was to play in full the Birmingham show, in full Download, and in full Lollapalooza. I had notified the representative that May 10 was my cutoff day in order to have good lead-in time for England. On the night of May 9 I asked for a brief letter to be sent to the representative asking to find out if we were at an end. On the morning of Thursday, May 10, I received a reply in the affirmative. After consulting with my advisors and crew a decision was made to let go and stop. I can't prioritize the Sabbath fans making one show more important than the other. I can't do that. All of you are important. It's all the gigs or none at all. I can't come to Birmingham and 'see what happens' knowing there is a risk of not being able to play Download or Lollapalooza. Again, for me, it's all or nothing. I had to say 'no' to Birmingham on the principle of wanting to play all the shows. Saying no to Birmingham is very difficult for me. My family grew up in Birmingham. Black Sabbath grew up in Birmingham. It's still my hometown and I resent having to arrive at such a difficult choice. Although the statement was made that, 'the door is always open' for me, as explained above, walking through that door is not always as easy as it sounds. There are many complicated issues and unseen and unspoken agendas on hand. I can assure you, my criteria for a ""signable"" contract is based in mindful principles, respectability, and acknowledgement of my history within the band. I hold no malice or resentment towards the other band members. I love them; I'm tolerant of them; I'm frustrated with them, as they may be with me. My fight has never been with them. I'll love them forever. In my opinion, nobody wins this time; the band doesn't win; the fans for an original lineup don't win. Nobody wins, nobody. Even the ones who thought they did. I didn't want to make this decision, but I have to be honest and transparent. This is the statement I didn't want to write; it's the last thing I wanted to do. But, I have written it, and now it can go into the universe. Since Spring of 2011, I've waited patiently and hopefully for a signable contract, you know the rest. I stand for the boy in the U.K., for the coming drum student, for all the drummers, who write their parts out and get stiffed on the publishing, I stand with the Sabbath fans chanting 'Bill Ward' and asking 'why?' and I stand with Tony and Geezer and Ozzy. On a final note, even though I'm at an end with the upcoming announced concerts, I will remain with an open mind and a position of willingness to negotiate 'signable' terms with Sabbath's representatives in the future. Stay strong. Stay safe. With all my heart and strength, I love you, . Bill Ward"" See the full story at RollingStone.com.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It was meant to be a show-stopping display of military might, a rocket poised to enter orbit to celebrate 100 years since the birth of the man who founded North Korea. But while the rapid disintegration of Unha-3 may have drawn sighs of relief from countries along its planned trajectory, one analyst says in this case failure may be more dangerous than success. ""Given the technology failure on such an important occasion on the 100th anniversary of Kim Il-sung, and given the failure of the symbolism of that, there's perhaps a need to compensate in some way,"" said Rory Medcalf, program director of international security at the Lowy Institute. That compensation could come in the form of short-range missile tests, Medcalf said. However, he added that ""they've done it so many times before that it's not all that impressive."" The alternative might be a nuclear test, Pyongyang's third since 2006, and another way for new leader Kim Jong Un to convey his power to the North Korean people. ""I wouldn't exaggerate it, but the chance of a nuclear test this year is now higher than it was yesterday,"" he said. In the days before Friday's launch, South Korean intelligence officers predicted that North Korea would use the international chorus of condemnation over the rocket launch as an excuse to test its nuclear technology. In a report obtained by CNN, they said recent satellite images showed the final stages of a tunnel being dug at Punggye-ri, the site of two previous tests in 2006 and 2009. ""Their nuclear test in 2006 is believed to have been a fizzer, the one in 2009 was still very small by standards of nuclear weapons, so there's an argument that their military would want to test again anyway,"" Medcalf said. ""Also their previous tests used a plutonium design, and they may want to prove a uranium bomb."" A nuclear test would also fit North Korea's pattern of serial provocations, analysts said. ""Certainly in 2006, you see a launch, you see a condemnation and some Security Council sanctions,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. ""You see some very tough words form the North Koreans and then you see a North Korean nuclear test. So it wouldn't surprise me to see that pattern play out again,"" he said. While the cycle of North Korean provocation and diplomacy might follow a predictable path, questions remain as to why the country pressed ahead with a rocket launch that, based on previous attempts, seemed destined to fail. Unlike previous launches, international media was invited to view launch preparations. They were given an unprecedented tour of the launch site and then front-row seats in a press center that showed blank screens as word spread outside the country that the launch had failed. Lewis said, by inviting journalists, Pyongyang may have been seeking to remove a layer of secrecy surrounding the event, thus reducing the likelihood of harsh international sanctions to a launch planned well before recent negotiations with the U.S. over the resumption of food aid. ""I really think that fundamentally they wanted to go ahead with this launch and they were trying to remove some of the pressure that was on them, reduce the chance of sanctions,"" he said. ""Bringing in the reporters was all part of their efforts at trying to be transparent. In a way they were sort of deluding themselves."" In late February, North Korea announced an agreement to freeze its nuclear and missile tests, along with uranium enrichment programs, and allow the return of U.N. nuclear inspectors. At the same time, the U.S said it would provide 240,000 metric tons of food aid to the impoverished country. The deal is now off after the launch which the White House says ""threatens regional security, violates international law and contravenes its own recent commitments."" Lewis said he believes Friday's rocket launch was the main motivation behind Pyongyang's recent willingness to engage with U.S. negotiators. ""People have tended to assume it must have been about the nutritional assistance. But I think it makes much more sense to imagine that they knew that they were going to do this rocket launch. And they knew that that would trigger a round of sanctions and hostility so they may have been bargaining to try to have the rocket launch, without all the sanctions,"" Lewis said. Any North Korean strategy to avoid tough international sanctions seems to have backfired amid a storm of criticism ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting on the launch on Friday. The regime's attempts to broadcast a powerful image to its people also seemed to have crashed along with the rocket debris. Pyongyang's unprecedented admission of the launch's failure is a sign, analysts said, that the regime is aware that it's getting harder to shield the truth from its people. ""It is just getting a little bit incrementally harder each year in North Korea to completely deceive its population about what's known in the outside world. And in this case, you had that extra pressure of expectation from the 100th birthday celebrations and the presence of the foreign media,"" Medcalf said. ""Perhaps North Korea's leaders recognize better than we imagined how much information technology has changed the world,"" Lewis added.","North Korea's rocket launch failure increases chance of nuclear test, analyst said .

"(CNN) -- All of the candidates in the presidential campaign agree the 2012 election will revolve around the economy. Although there are signs that conditions are slightly improving, the high unemployment rate and the depressed housing market are causing immense anxiety among American voters. As a result, most of the political debate has centered on how the nation will rebound from the steep 2007-09 recession and anemic recovery that has afflicted the nation throughout President Barack Obama's term in the White House. Republicans and Democrats have tried to walk a political high wire as the release of new economic data continually changes the playing field. Mitt Romney, for instance, fell into a trap when he admitted that there were signs the economy was improving, a statement that caused many Republicans to grumble about their front-runner handing Democrats the key issue. Meanwhile, Obama's optimism has often been undercut with data showing that the situation is still bad. With all the attention that has been given to short-term economic recovery, however, politicians in both parties have generally avoided the types of long-term structural challenges that are really at the heart of national anxiety and which greatly threaten America's ability to compete with China and other rising economic powers. The first problem has been the exodus of good jobs to other countries. In one of the most troubling developments of recent decades, many types of industrial jobs have been shipped overseas. And by and large, they won't be returning. Numerous companies have built facilities in other countries where labor costs are lower, workplace laws are lax or nonexistent and other kinds of regulations are weak. According to a recent study by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, the United States lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs in the 2000s. If these trends continue, the tight labor market will become the new normal. The chances for high school and college graduates to land solid jobs in the U.S. will diminish, as has already been the case for many working Americans who have watched the factories shut down. Another chronic challenge facing the U.S. is the rising level of inequality in the United States. The gap between the rich and poor has grown dramatically since the 1970s. A troubling trend that has lasted for decades has been that the average income of the top 5% has risen while the average income of the rest of the nation has fallen. The number of Americans in the ranks of the middle class has thinned. The income supports upon which workers depended have diminished, both those provided by government and by private employers. More Americans find themselves squeezed lower onto the lower rungs of the economic ladder. As many commentators have noted, there are a number of causes for this growing gap, including public policy. Without the ability of the government and private markets to reverse this trend, the U.S. will not be able to sustain the kind of vibrant middle class -- which in the 1940s and 1950s was attainable by more and more Americans -- that has been the engine behind the American dream. The final challenge is an urban crisis that has decimated pockets of America. As Thomas Sugrue showed in his award-winning book, ""The Origins of the Urban Crisis,"" the breakdown of the cities began in the 1940s and 1950s as racist employment practices and real estate markets hampered the ability of African-Americans to get good jobs or relocate into better neighborhoods. The problems accelerated as jobs continued to move into the suburbs (before moving overseas). Rioting in the 1960s further devastated these communities. The result of the urban crisis has been that multiple generations of inner-city residents have lived with little hope for a better future and have struggled to make ends meet, trying to survive on streets that are ridden by crime and drugs. Many black leaders have been deeply disappointed that Obama, the first African-American occupant of the White House, has not done much to address these issues. Although Republican Rick Santorum recently proposed tax cuts to lure business into these areas, there is little evidence that such a change in policy would do much to reverse decades of decay. These are not the kinds of issues that politicians like to talk about in their campaigns. As opposed to temporary recessions, these quasi-permanent structural challenges have been decades in the making and will require wrenching policy choices as well as dramatic market developments to resolve. If our political leaders don't address these issues that underlie the concerns of the nation, it will become ever more difficult to re-create the vibrant economic conditions that existed during the ""American Century"" when grand expectations about the future, as the historian James Patterson argued, guided public debate. Then, the nation was strong and the possibilities for growth seemed infinite. Today, even if short-term conditions improve, our economy is far from what it used to be. How to achieve a better future is the debate that we really should be having in 2012. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Candidates agree that the economy is the main issue in the election .

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman's defense team formally requested Monday that the Florida judge assigned to their client's case be removed after she revealed her husband works with a CNN legal analyst. Mark O'Mara's office filed paperwork Monday asking that Seminole Circuit Judge Jessica Recksiedler not preside over second-degree murder proceedings involving Zimmerman, according to Seminole County Court spokeswoman Michelle Kennedy. The motion to ""disqualify"" the trial judge ""will be ruled on in the appropriate manner,"" Kennedy said Monday. Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, fatally shot teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, a killing he has said was in self-defense. Since then, the case has stirred civil rights activists nationwide and drawn intense publicity. Bill Cosby: Guns, not race, key issue in Martin case . Recksiedler is assigned to the Zimmerman case. But on Friday, she said she would entertain motions to disqualify her from the trial after discovering that her husband is a law partner of Mark NeJame, an attorney whom Zimmerman approached about representing him and has since widely commented on the case in the media. NeJame is now a CNN contributor, providing analysis on this case. NeJame told CNN that Zimmerman ""contacted my office, attempting to reach me, and wanted to hire me to represent him"" on March 13. One of his law partners relayed that request to NeJame, who declined. He explained later that he knew how taking on ""big national cases (can) take a lot out of you"" and wanted to have more time to spend with his children. ""I decided simply not to,"" the Orlando lawyer said. A friend of Zimmerman's later repeated the request in a direct conversation with NeJame early last week, just as lawyers Hal Uhrig and Craig Sonner said they'd no longer represent Zimmerman. By then, NeJame noted he'd been hired by CNN to serve as an analyst. NeJame again said he could not represent Zimmerman and offered the names of five lawyers -- topped by O'Mara -- who might be considered instead. ""They said Mark is the one we want, I put them together, and they took it from there,"" said NeJame. O'Mara had indicated on Friday that the defense might request a new judge, when he said the association between NeJame and the Recksiedlers might become ""more and more problematic"" given the scrutiny the case is receiving. He told CNN on Monday night that he was confident the request to pull Recksiedler off the case would succeed. ""If it is reasonably well-founded and sworn to, it'll be granted,"" O'Mara said. Insisting that there had been ""full transparency,"" NeJame said Monday that he understood why Zimmerman's defense team asked for the judge's removal -- because of his involvement in the case and his professional relationship with her husband -- and was content that the matter is now in the legal system's control. ""Everybody just needs to do the right thing, file it and let the process (be resolved) properly,"" NeJame said. Meanwhile, news media organizations, including CNN, petitioned Recksiedler on Monday to reverse an order sealing court records in Zimmerman's prosecution. Prosecutors did not object when Zimmerman's attorneys asked Recksiedler to seal records last week. The judge ordered the court filings and other records sealed ""without giving the public and press an opportunity to oppose closure,"" the media said in its motion. Florida law requires a judge to consider whether the records closure is needed to ""prevent a serious and imminent threat"" to justice, the media members argued. The court must also find that there is no alternative to sealing the records that would provide a fair trial and that the action would not be ""broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose,"" they said. Zimmerman's attorneys did not address those issues or present any evidence, the motion said. Older brother: Trayvon was a happy teen . ""In case after case in Florida, courts -- including the United States Supreme Court -- have held that prominence and publicity are not synonymous with prejudice and impartiality, and have cautioned against assuming that all potential jurors follow the news and retain what they read and watch,"" the media filing says. Jurors who can't set aside their biases created by exposure to pretrial publicity can be screened out during jury selection, the media motion argued. Besides CNN, several broadcasting and newspaper companies -- including the publishers of USA Today, The Miami Herald and The New York Times -- are part of the effort to unseal the documents. O'Mara said Monday that he favors keeping documents sealed in this case in large part because of concerns that witnesses might be contacted and in danger if certain information is released. ""(Our) overall philosophy (is) to keep the information flow concentrated within the court system,"" he told CNN. ""It's much better handled there."" As to his client, O'Mara said he speaks ""at least a couple times a day"" with Zimmerman, whom he described as doing well physically but ""frightened."" Zimmerman is scheduled to return to court Friday for a bail hearing. O'Mara says that he hopes his client will be eligible for bond after that hearing and eventually be allowed to go free until the trial. If he does get out, though, the lawyer said there are legitimate fears about Zimmerman's safety. ""There have been a lot of emotions that have come forward in this case, and some of those emotions have shown themselves in bad ways,"" O'Mara said.","NEW: Mark O'Mara describes his client, George Zimmerman, as ""frightened""

"(CNN) -- This ought to keep the Maytag repairman busy for a while. The appliance manufacturer along with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on Thursday announced the recall of about 1.7 million dishwashers sold by the company between February 2006 and April of 2010.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Two aging former military commanders who masterminded a 1980 coup d'etat in Turkey failed to appear in court Wednesday due to health reasons, the semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported. Kenan Evren, a nonagenarian retired army general and former president, and former air force chief Tahsin Sahinkaya face charges of committing ""acts against the forces of the state,"" according to the indictment. Prosecutors are asking for a penalty of ""aggravated life sentence"" if the two former commanders are found guilty. Hundreds of activists gathered outside the courthouse in Ankara on Wednesday morning. Many held portraits of victims tortured or executed in the aftermath of the September 12, 1980, coup. ""We won't forgive,"" said one demonstrator's sign. The activists present represented a broad range of Turkey's political spectrum, from communists on the far left to labor unions and militants from the ultra-nationalist right. ""It's a turning point. It's incredible,"" said Mehmet Ali Birand, a veteran Turkish television broadcaster and author of the book ""The Generals' Coup in Turkey: An Inside Story of 12 September 1980."" Until recent years, military commanders acted with relative impunity in Turkey, regularly intervening in domestic politics and -- on at least four occasions in the past 60 years -- overthrowing governments. Many Turkish commentators said Wednesday's trial marked a historic reversal for the army generals. ""Turkey's first face-off with military coups starts today,"" announced the headline in the English-language Hurriyet Daily News on Wednesday. ""I never really thought that one day I would see this,"" added Birand. Evren, now 94, led the overthrow of the Turkish government when he ordered tanks out into the streets of the capital in the predawn hours of September 12, 1980. Evren appeared in uniform on Turkish state television later that afternoon and made the following announcement: ""My dear citizens, I would like to state one more time that armed forces had to take over the administration for the welfare and happiness that the dear Turkish nation deserved, for the unity of the country and nation, to renew the strength and functionality of Ataturk principles which were tried to be made less effective, to place democracy that cannot control itself on firm foundations, to restore the state authority which had been lost."" The military overthrow brought an end to years of bloody killings between right- and left-wing Turkish militants, and many prominent voices in Turkey and abroad initially welcomed the coup. A passage from ""Turkey Unveiled, a History of Modern Turkey"" recalls: ""The cover of Time magazine showed a paternalistic portrait of General Evren clasping a collage of the Istanbul skyline in his arms with the caption 'Holding Turkey Together.'"" ""At the beginning, everyone said, 'Oh my God, thank God that they saved us,'"" Birand recalled. ""But six months later, everything changed and this was the worst-case scenario."" In the aftermath of the military takeover, accounts of appalling human rights violations began to emerge, as hundreds of thousands of people were thrown in jail, many of them tortured. The military junta also disbanded political parties, jailed senior politicians and sentenced hundreds of people to death. Longtime Turkey-watchers argue Turkish society is still struggling with the consequences of the coup. ""September 12th is the mother of all coups in Turkey's history,"" said Yasemin Congar, columnist and deputy editor of the Turkish daily newspaper 'Taraf.' It damaged the whole country and probably caused incurable damage on one whole generation of the youth in this society."" ""It brought Turkish politics back to the kindergarten,"" said Hugh Pope, co-author of ""Turkey Unveiled."" ""(Evren) somehow wanted to force the politicians to be less conflictual, but he did so by dumbing them down to the point that Turkey's political system is still recovering from it ... unfortunately the consequences of his actions ruined so many people's lives. One has to wonder how Turkey is going to deal with that."" After stepping down from the post of president in 1989, Evren lived for years on Turkey's Mediterranean Coast. One of his widely reported pastimes was painting. The former coup leader's works of art have even been displayed in exhibits. According to an article in the Turkish constitution, which was written by the military junta in 1982, Evren and his fellow officers were protected from prosecution. But recent constitutional changes drafted and ratified by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party cleared the way for a prosecutor to question Evren at his home last year. Erdogan's government has also overseen the arrest and trial of dozens of other army generals accused of a much more recent military coup plot that was never successfully carried out. Among those arrested are retired general and army chief of staff Ilker Basbug, who commanded the Turkish armed forces until 2010. He stormed out of a courtroom outside Istanbul last week, after court officials played recordings of wiretapped phone conversations. Some critics have called the prosecution of these military commanders a witch hunt, targeting political opponents of Erdogan's government. Other observers argue it has been a vital process to bring the military under the control of elected civilian leaders. Since 1960, the once politically-dominant Turkish armed forces have overthrown four governments. ""Ending the belief of impunity is very, very important,"" said Congar of 'Taraf' newspaper, which has published many damning reports about the Turkish military in recent years. ""It's a huge step, obviously very late. These generals are very old. But it's still symbolically very important for this country.""","Former President Kenan Evren, 94, is one of the leaders on trial .

"(CNN) -- Goal machine Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid won 3-2 at Real Betis in the Spanish Primera Liga on Saturday -- their 11th victory in a row. But it was far from easy for Jose Mourinho's league leaders, who trailed to an early goal in his 100th game in charge of the Spanish giants. Jorge Molina scored on nine minutes for Betis after a superb move before Gonzalo Higuain drew Real level in the 25th minute with an empathic strike. La Liga's top scorer Ronaldo put Real ahead after the break but Jefferson Montero grabbed a deserved equalizer before the hour mark. Ronaldo sealed the win with a close range strike in the 72nd minute with his 32nd goal of the league season. There was still time for Betis to pressure the Real goal and they had strong penalty appeals turned away in injury time as Sergio Ramos appeared to block a shot with his arm. Real Madrid lead Barcelona by 13 points but the defending champions can cut the gap to 10 with victory away to Racing Santander. Meanwhile in Serie A, AS Roma improved their chance of European qualification with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Palermo. Fabio Borini's eventual winner came after just three minutes as Roma moved above Inter Milan into sixth place.

"Washington (CNN) -- At a gathering of his safety-minded peers, John Lee had a confession to make. Last month, while driving to Madison, Wisconsin, Lee glanced down to review a playlist on his car's MP3 player. He scrolled through the titles, looking for Bruce Springsteen songs, ""wanting to avoid the Adele songs that my wife had put there."" Then Lee looked up... and continued driving. There was no crash. No one died. Unremarkable? Lee doesn't think so. Lee, an expert at human-machine interactions at the University of Wisconsin, had just co-authored a paper titled ""Scrolling While Driving."" And despite his own heightened awareness about the dangers of distracted driving, he had spent three to five seconds with his eyes off the road, a time lapse that placed him well into the danger zone. The incident, he said, demonstrated the insidious creep of distracting technology into the automobile. ""It seems like the old technology,"" he said of his car's audio system. ""It seems like a radio. But it isn't."" And if Lee -- who has forsworn cell phone and text messaging in his car -- can be lulled into a distracting experience, anybody can, he said. ""I've been very well-trained to the dangers of distraction, and yet I'm vulnerable,"" he said. Lee's anecdote at a National Transportation Safety Board all-day forum Tuesday hit upon two themes -- the invasion of pernicious technology in automobiles and the precious few seconds it takes to go from an attentive driver to a distracted one. Lee and a panel of experts said that any distraction of two seconds or longer significantly increases the likelihood of a crash. Novice drivers are 16 times more likely to take a dangerous glance inside the vehicle than experienced drivers, the experts said, citing one study. And the risk of a crash increases ""four-fold"" if a driver was on the phone, regardless of whether they were using a hand-held or a hands-free device, they said. Some agreement; some dispute . The forum comes at a time when the NTSB and the Department of Transportation are at odds over just how far the government should go to restrict digital devices in cars. The Department of Transportation is recommending that states ban the use of handheld cell phones and text messaging devices. But the NTSB wants to take it a step further, banning the use of hands-free devices, except those that aid driving. ""Things that are hands-free are distracting too,"" said NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman. ""We'd like to see requirements and standards that look at all distractions, not just the manipulative or the visual distractions, but recognizing that there's a cognitive distraction,"" she said. Experts call it ""looking but not seeing."" ""The issue of cognitive distraction seems to have been left off the table -- forgotten a little bit,"" she said. Distractions everywhere . Driver distractions are hardly new, safety board members and panels acknowledged. Everything from billboards, to beautiful scenery, to pretty girls, have distracted drivers since the advent of automobiles, they said. But new texting technology creates a ""perfect storm"" of activities that create danger, prompting users to look and engage. In addition to taking a driver's eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, texting devices can engage people's minds so that they're paying less attention to the task of driving, the experts said. And the technology is evolving faster than its impact can be appreciated, Lee said. ""The pace of change is daunting. The pace of change far outstrips the pace of regulatory response,"" he explained. An often-quoted study on distracted driving known as the ""100 car study"" was conducted in 2003 and 2004 -- before the introduction of Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), the iPhone (2007), and iPhone apps (2008), Lee said. Driver distraction is a growing contributor to U.S. traffic fatalities, said Jeff Caird of the University of Calgary. In 1999, there were 4,563 distracted driving fatalities, accounting for 10.9% of all fatalities. In 2008, there were 5,870 distraction fatalities, 15.8% of the total. But police reports are not a reliable source of information for the cause of distracted driving accidents, said Anne McCartt of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The cause of accidents is frequently not reported, and there are very large differences across the states, McCartt said. The best studies, she said, used phone records to determine if drivers were possibly distracted at the time of a crash, she said. Cell phones vs. conversations . Cell phones are more distracting than conversing with passengers, said Donald Fisher of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. A passenger is ""an extra set of eyes,"" and can moderate their conversation during challenging driving periods, unlike a person on a phone, Fisher said. They can serve as a collision avoidance system, ""pointing out hazards and screaming in the extreme case,"" said Lee. Passengers can be distracting too, said Caird. Some modulate conversations; some don't, he said. But for all the study on distracting driving, a lot is still unknown, the experts said. Experts, for example, don't know to what extent drivers self-regulate, confining dialing and texting to less dangerous times, such as at stop lights. And they don't know whether people who choose to buy hands-free devices differ from those who use hand-held devices, and how that may impact test results. But experts at the NTSB forum say distractions of two seconds or more appear to divide safe driving from dangerous driving. The challenge, they said, was getting drivers to understand just how fleeting two seconds is. Fighting fire with fire . The experts say the solution to technological distraction may be technology itself. Already, smart phones have applications that can regulate use, restricting the use of cell phones or texting services while the device is moving, for instance. Industry has become a major force, using dashboard cameras to keep tabs on fleet drivers. Increasingly, new cars are equipped with collision warning systems. And those systems are becoming more sophisticated. At the University of Iowa's National Advanced Driving Simulator, scientists have tested a seat belt that tightens to warn the driver of a possible crash. ""What we've learned is that auditory displays can be a nuisance,"" said Daniel McGehee, of the NADS lab. ""They are annoying. They alert other passengers that something is going on and that's embarrassing to the driver."" However, a seatbelt that tightens, a vibrating seat or a pulsing brake are ""very driver-centric."" ""The driver can say, 'Oops, something's going on here' and sort of reorient their attention."" Back to those play lists . In John Lee's study, 50 people searched for songs on playlists of varying lengths using either an MP3 player or an aftermarket controller while driving on a simulator. The results: searching through long playlists containing 580 songs resulted in poor driving performance and required long glances of two seconds or more. ""Drivers did not adequately adapt their behavior to roadway demand, as evident in their degraded driving performance,"" his study concludes. Lee says he now knows that from scientific research and from personal experience. CNN's Lizzie O'Leary contributed to this report.","Experts say a distraction of more than 2 seconds is dangerous .

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II is marking her 86th birthday Saturday privately at Windsor Castle, a palace spokesman said. The Queen also has an official birthday in June, which will be celebrated publicly as part of events to mark the Diamond Jubilee. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment fired a 62-gun salute for her real birthday at the Tower of London, Retired Lt. Col. Stuart Green said. Hundreds of guests gathered for the salute, which included 21 guns for the Queen's birthday, 21 because it's a royal palace and 20 guns to show the City of London's loyalty to the monarch, Green said. The regiment, usually based in Gibraltar, is currently in London for ceremonial duties including guarding Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London, he said. A 41-gun salute in Hyde Park and a 21-gun salute in Windsor Great Park were also held to honor the Queen. The salute in Hyde Park was performed by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, using teams of galloping horses to pull six World War I-era guns into position. The 41 rounds were then fired at 10-second intervals, the Ministry of Defence said. On her official birthday each June, the Queen and other members of the royal family attend the Trooping the Colour military parade in central London.

"(CNN) -- In October 1985, the Formula One circus arrived in South Africa to race at Kayalami. Apartheid -- which had put an end to almost all other sporting events in the country -- didn't deter F1, even if both the Ligier and Renault teams refused to race. Marlboro removed its sponsorship from the McLaren cars of Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, and various governments tried to stop their drivers racing. Sound familiar? Although South Africa during apartheid and Bahrain now are two completely different political situations, you can't help but wonder whether F1 has moved on at all in the last 27 years. The view of Formula One Management's chief Bernie Ecclestone that the elite division of motorsport doesn't do politics seems somewhat out of kilter. The civil unrest in Bahrain -- and the political implications of F1 racing there -- has led to UK politicians asking for the race to be canceled. On April 13 the sport's governing body -- the FIA -- announced that the race would go ahead despite continuing conflict between Shia protesters and the Sunni government. The decision was met with shock from F1 fans around the world. ""Imagine we said, 'No way are we going,' - would the problems stop?"" Ecclestone told the BBC at last weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. ""The answer is no because they are not protesting about F1 and that's why we are going to Bahrain."" Ecclestone -- never one to kowtow to convention -- may have missed the Shia protesters carrying toy machine guns and wearing motor racing overalls. He may also have missed the banner reading ""Stop racing on our blood"" and the government's ""UniF1ed"" campaign. No, there is not political unrest because of F1, but the sport is being used as a political tool and could be used as a stage upon which to be heard. Ask any F1 sponsor why they are in the sport and they will tell you about the amazing global platform that it provides. The same argument, understandably, applies to protesters who want to make a point. ""I don't see lots of protests throughout the country,"" economist and former Bahraini politician Jasim Husain told the UK Press Association. ""But yes, the fear is there that we could see some casualties. So it's now a challenge for the security forces who have to handle things properly. They should avoid using force."" In a press conference on Friday, Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Ahalifa expressed his reasoning behind the race going ahead. ""I think canceling just empowers extremists,"" he said. ""I think for those of us that are trying to navigate a way out of this political problem, having a race allows us to build bridges across communities and get people working together."" Three-time F1 world champion Jackie Stewart is a firm believer that sport can unite people. That may be so, but only if the sport in question is neutral. F1 most certainly isn't in this case. The Bahraini government not only owns the Sakhir track, but it also invested millions to build the circuit before the first race there in 2004. It also owns a stake in Britain's McLaren, one of the participating teams, so it's clear why many Shia protesters are so against the event taking place. The FIA has had people in Bahrain monitoring the situation for some time now, and the teams and drivers have said that they trust its decision to race in the Middle East kingdom, even if some teams have taken extra security with them. But, with four Force India team members being close to a petrol bomb after leaving the track on Thursday, it's clear that the extra security is not enough. Indeed, two members of the team have since requested to return home. There are also reports that a Williams employee has quit over the situation. Of course, nowhere is safe -- a mad priest managed to run onto the track during the 2003 British Grand Prix -- but surely a sport should not be competing in a country where its participants are anywhere near a petrol bomb? The safety of the teams and the island's citizens should be put before a sporting event. ""It is obviously not right that this sort of stuff happens,"" Force India driver Nico Hulkenberg told reporters on Thursday. ""We are here to race. The F1 business is about entertainment, and these sort of things should not really be happening to us. Whether it is right or not I don't really know. I am not a politician, I am a Formula One driver."" Other drivers have remained quiet -- and very neutral -- on the subject. As many will remember, the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was at first postponed and then canceled due to riots and the much-publicized ""Day of Rage"" on February 14. So what has changed this year? And why is Formula One able to race? Last year the British foreign office raised its evaluation of the threat level in the country and with that came insurance problems for the teams. There was pressure from the FIA and FOM to cancel the race, which the Bahraini government duly did. By doing so it missed out on an estimated $480-800 million of investment that would have come from hosting it. The race looks as though it will go ahead and, with the circuit being based in the desert, it should be easier than some to keep secure. However, if something does go wrong then it is going to be extremely hard for F1 to recover its integrity. The South African Grand Prix was canceled immediately after that 1985 race by the FIA's then-president Jean-Marie Balestre. It didn't return until 1992, once apartheid had ended. F1 did learn from its mistakes all those years ago, even if it was too late for many. The fact that it seems to have forgotten that lesson now is baffling many fans around the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Foster.","Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix will take place amid a backdrop of anti-government protests .

"(CNN) -- A House committee voted along party lines to cite Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over documents sought by the panel investigating the botched gun-running sting called Operation Fast and Furious. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama entered the dispute by asserting executive privilege over the documents sought by committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California. Here are the issues around the dispute: . Q: What is a contempt citation? A: Congress can vote to hold a congressional witness in contempt of Congress if it considers the witness to be obstructing its ability to carry out its constitutional powers. For a person to be held in contempt, Congress must vote on a contempt citation in committee. This is different from finding a person in contempt, which only happens after the committee votes on a citation and then passes along the vote to the full house. The process involves a series of legal maneuvers including the president's ability to assert executive privilege, as he did in this case. Executive privilege is rarely accepted by Congress, but the Justice Department maintains that infringing on executive privilege erodes the balance of powers. Q: Why was Holder cited for contempt? A: The Oversight Committee cited Holder for contempt for failing to hand over all the documents relating to Operation Fast and Furious, the botched Justice Department sting operation linked to the death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry and a number of Mexican citizens from some of the 2,000 weapons that fell into the hands of Mexican drug gangs. Q: When is the last time an executive branch official faced a contempt citation? A: Although this is the first time an attorney general has faced a contempt citation, other executive branch officials have been held in contempt of Congress. Most recently, George W. Bush White House Counsel Harriet Miers and Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten were held in contempt of Congress despite Bush asserting executive privilege in their case. During the vote in early 2008, a large number of Republicans walked out in protest of what they saw as a partisan vote. Miers and Bolten were accused of failing to cooperate in a congressional investigation into the mass firings of U.S. attorneys and allegations that the White House was using the Justice Department for political aims. Their citations marked the first time White House officials had been found in contempt of Congress. What do you think? Share your view on video . Q: What happens next? A: The partisan 23-17 vote in favor of a contempt in committee sends the decision to the full House for another vote. If that vote finds Holder in contempt, then, according to George Washington University Law School Associate Dean Alan Morrison, it is unlikely that Holder will be prosecuted for criminal contempt. ""It would look like terrible overreaching to go for criminal contempt,"" Morrison said, which carries a penalty of $1,000 and up to one year in prison. Instead, Morrison says it is more likely the House will pursue civil prosecution in federal court, as it did in the Miers and Bolten cases. The House General Counsel's office prosecuted the pair to gain access to the information Congress sought. CNN's Allison Brennan contributed to this report.","House committee votes to cite Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt .

"(CNN) -- World champion Casey Stoner has given himself the perfect chance to return to the top of the MotoGP standings after qualifying in pole position for Sunday's Portuguese Grand Prix. The Australian set the fastest time of one minute 37.188 seconds at Estoril on Saturday to head off Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa and British rider Cal Crutchlow. It was Stoner's second pole position this season and the 35th of his top-level motorcycling career as he bids to close the four-point gap on series leader Jorge Lorenzo.

"(CNN) -- Wild Oats XI crossed the line first in the 66th Rolex Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Tuesday, but the Australian super maxi's fifth victory in the annual event is in doubt due to an official protest. Wild Oats and British entry Ran were both reported by the race committee a few hours earlier after breaking safety rules by failing to make radio contact, and a hearing will be held on Wednesday. ""Both have reported only by telephone, which does not comply, so the protests were lodged at 5.05 p.m. today,"" committee chairman Tim Cox said. The rules are in place after six people died when severe weather conditions hit the 1998 race, sinking five yachts and forcing a record 66 to retire. Official race website . ""This is a fundamental safety issue,"" Cox said. ""Should a situation occur, we cannot organize search and rescue operations via telephones. I consider this a serious breach."" The 100-foot Wild Oats, skippered by Australian Mark Richards, sailed into the Tasmanian capital two days, seven hours, 37 minutes and 20 seconds after leaving Sydney Harbor, having led most of the way. ""A few people got their facts mixed up,"" Richards said. ""We've got some of the most accredited yachtsmen and women on this boat. We've won numerous world championships. We've dealt with juries all our lives and we're very confident we did everything by the book. ""It is disappointing. There is no way that as skipper I would have left Green Cape [on the south coast of New South Wales] without knowing we were 100% compliant with the rules."" Weather batters Sydney-Hobart race fleet . Wild Oats finished second last year, breaking a run of four successive victories. But this time Richards and crew safely negotiated gale-force conditions which led to 16 boats retiring to finish well ahead of their rivals, completing their journey up the Derwent River at 8:37 p.m. local time (0937 GMT.) Second-placed Investec Royal finished almost four hours later, having been becalmed in sight of the docks. Its skipper Sean Langman reported that his boat -- crewed by sports stars including former cricketer Matthew Hayden, rugby players Phil Kearns and Phil Waugh plus surfing world champion Layne Beachley and swimmer Geoff Huegill -- had experienced several problems. ""The damage we sustained was to the reef lines earlier and some tack lines on the headsail which, running without a headsail, put us an hour back. Also, a fuel tank broke lose. These tanks carry so much fuel that you've got a quarter of a ton to manhandle, which is difficult,"" he said on Tuesday. ""We didn't realize that we had a substantial leak in the bow and carried on with a ton and a half of water, which we only detected this morning. We have a watertight bulkhead up there and when we opened it, water came pouring out."" Peter Millard's Lahana crossed the line in third, an improvement on last year's eighth placing.

"(EW.com) -- As a star birthed by YouTube and raised by Twitter, Justin Bieber has never had the luxury of growing up outside the public eye. In the two years between his breakout 2010 LP, ""My World 2.0,"" and ""Believe,"" his second proper full-length, Bieber has had to go through cultural puberty and actual puberty â€” a tough gauntlet by any measure. Luckily, his instincts (or at least the instincts of the small republic of people employed to steer the USS Bieber) are strong, and Believe works surprisingly well as a reinvention and a reintroduction. It's the rare album that tries to be everything to everyone and largely succeeds. Like his mentor Usher, Bieber fully embraces both Ibiza beats (see dubsteppy bangers ''All Around the World'' and ''Take You'') and urban swagger (Drake and Nicki Minaj each drop by). Believe also updates his signature sounds. ''Catching Feelings'' would have been a smooth spoonful of radio sugar on his debut, but the new Bieber turns it into a soulful R&B campfire jam. Biology has robbed him of some of his range, but he makes up for it in confidence: First-gen Bieber couldn't have handled the goosebumpy swoop of ''Fall,'' but this JB turns it into the album's profound emotional climax.

"(CNN) -- World No. 3 Roger Federer ended a seven-year wait for a second World Tennis Tournament title after beating Juan Martin del Potro in the Dutch city of Rotterdam.

Federer's triumph was his 71st career title and means 2012 becomes the 12th straight year in which he has captured an ATP tour crown. The Swiss, who also won here in 2005, said in a courtside interview: ""It's incredible that it took me seven years to come back and defend my title, I hope the next time is not so long. But if it is, then it means I'll be playing for another seven years."" ""This title marks a great start to the season. My team made a lot of sacrifices. It's been an amazing week for us."" Of his opponent, who beat him in the 2009 U.S. Open final, Federer said: ""Juan Martin had a great week. He's playing great tennis. I hope to see you at the (November) World Tour Finals."" Federer, who took his record to 9-2 over Del Potro, blew his opponent away in the opening set, racing into a 5-0 lead after only 28 minutes and securing the opener 6-1 shortly after. Del Potro rallied in the second set, and forced Federer to save a clutch of break points, but the 30-year-old secured the decisive break in the fifth game to seal the match. It marks a return to form for Federer who came into the tournament on the back of two defeats -- to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Australian Open and American John Isner in the Davis Cup. In South America, Spain's Nicolas Almagro retained his Brazil Open crown with a 6-3 4-6 6-4 victory over Italy's Filippo Volandri. The top seed and world no. 11 hit 18 aces as he made it 11 career titles, all of which have come on clay.","Roger Federer defeats Juan Martin del Potro to win World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam .

"(CNN) -- A tennis player's biggest challenge usually comes from the opposite baseline, but Alisa Kleybanova has taken on an opponent of an entirely different nature over the last 10 months. The former world No. 20 announced in July 2011 she had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a form of cancer, after missing both the French Open and Wimbledon. The 22-year-old Russian made a successful return to the court at the Miami Masters on Tuesday after battling to overcome the disease. It was a fairytale return for Kleybanova, who was handed a wildcard for the U.S. hard-court tournament, as she came from behind to record a 2-6 6-3 6-2 first-round win against 64th-ranked Swede Johanna Larsson.. Venus Williams vows to rise again . ""The first match back from anything is always difficult, but especially this time I really had no idea how it was going to be out there,"" Kleybanova told the WTA's official website. ""Tennis-wise I felt pretty good from the beginning but Johanna has a difficult game to play against, she makes you run a lot out there -- she makes you tired even if you're in your best shape."" Kleybanova, who will face 20th-seeded compatriot Maria Kirilenko next, said fighting the illness has given her a different perspective on the sport. ""I'm looking at my matches differently now,"" she said. ""It's my work, but I really just wanted to enjoy every point and every moment. ""Even when I lost the first set I wanted to stay positive and just enjoy myself out there, and that's why I was able to stay out there and change the way the match was going. ""It's not just about the win though, it's that I'm back on court. If I didn't win, it's not like I would have been mad. I was just happy to be playing points, feeling all the emotions again... it's something I missed a lot and it was all out there today."" It was also a memorable occasion for Kleybanova's coach Julian Vespan, who she described as her ""best friend."" ""Of course he's very, very happy I won, but he's also my best friend and he feels happy when I feel good and when I'm smiling. He just wants me to be happy. When he saw me enjoying myself again he was very happy for me.""","Alisa Kleybanova wins on her return to tennis at the Miami Masters .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Novak Djokovic fought off fellow Serbian Janko Tipsarevic Thursday to earn a semifinal match in Dubai against third seed Andy Murray. It will be a repeat of their epic last-four clash at the Australian Open in January, when Djokovic prevailed in five sets on his way to his fifth grand slam crown. Both he and Murray are playing their first tournament since their Melbourne exertions but both have shown little signs of ring rust. Three-time defending Dubai champion Djokovic saved a set point in the second-set tiebreaker before beating Tipsarevic 6-1 7-6, while Murray saw off the fifth seed Tomas Berdych 6-3 7-5. Victory for Djokovic was revenge for a defeat to his Davis Cup teammate at the ATP World Tour Finals in London last November and he acknowledged that he was fortunate the match had not gone to a deciding set. ""He was very close to take that second set,"" the top seed told the official ATP website. ""Then who knows what could have happened. We both got a little bit nervous towards the end, I guess, and it was just luck to prevail."" Murray claimed his first win over Berdych in seven years and made the perfect start to break the Czech in the second game of the opener to take a one-set lead. The Scot twice broke in the second set, only for the big-hitting Berdych to retrieve them. But a further break in the 11th game proved decisive and he eventually claimed victory in one hour and 51 minutes. ""I had a great match with him in Australia, and hopefully can reverse the result tomorrow,"" Murray said of Friday's clash with Djokovic. Meanwhile, second seed Roger Federer continued his quest for a fifth Dubai title and improved to 12-0 against Mikhail Youzhny with a 6-3 6-4 win over the Russia to reach the last four. He will battle Juan Martin del Potro for a place in the final after the Argentine got past fourth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 6-2. It was eighth seed del Potro's second win over the Frenchman in a week, beating him in Marseille on the way to the title. But he lost to Federer in this year's Rotterdam final and has a 2-9 record against the Swiss maestro.","Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic reaches Dubai semifinals .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Rafael Nadal will continue his bid for a first title this year in Friday's semifinal clash against Andy Murray at the Miami Masters. Nadal, beaten in the final of the Australian Open in late January, is seeking to become the first Spaniard to win the U.S. hard-court event. He was runner-up in Florida last year and 2008. He booked his place in the last four with a 6-2 5-7 6-4 win over French sixth seed, while world No. 4 Murray came from a set and a break down to beat Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic 4-6 6-3 6-4 earlier on Wednesday. ""I didn't play very well,"" 10-time grand slam champion Nadal told the ATP Tour website after beating Tsonga at the same stage for a second year in a row. ""I think I started the match playing really well, but later when I had the break in the second set, I started to play more defensive. ""My feeling was Jo was having much more mistakes than usual, so the match didn't have the right rhythm."" Murray won their last encounter in the Tokyo final last October, but Nadal has a 13-5 career advantage and beat the Brit in three successive grand slam semifinals in 2011. ""Playing Andy is a pleasure for me, and it's exciting playing against a player like him who pushes you to the limit on everything,"" said Nadal, who has also reached the semis in Doha and Indian Wells this year. ""The negative thing is I have to recover well."" Murray looked to be heading for the exit when he received medical attention for a stomach complaint in the second set, but soon turned the match around breaking Tipsarevic's next service game before going on to clinch the set. ""Today's match was really important for me to get through after how it was going,"" Murray said. ""I came up with some big serves and served my way out of trouble, which is important. ""They were tough, tough conditions. Because of the wind, I was maybe trying to hit it too close to the line and not building the points as much I needed to. So when I did that, I did a bit better."" Defending champion Novak Djokovic will play Spanish fifth seed in Thursday's night match in Key Biscayne, with the winner to face either American eighth seed Mardy Fish or Argentine No. 1 Juan Monaco in the semis.","Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal through to the semifinals of the Miami Masters .

"(CNN) -- The Australian Open provides a testing challenge for the world's top tennis players as they turn out for the first grand slam tournament of the season. The searing heat of the Melbourne summer sun, the high bounce of the blue Plexicushion hard-court playing surface and the boisterous atmosphere generated by the packed stands all blend together to make the January 14-29 event an unforgettable experience. It may not yet have prestige of the other three majors, but it is a place where stars are born and where legendary reputations are no guarantee of success -- and the rewards have grown greater and greater. The 2012 edition is the 100th in the tournament's illustrious history, but what do you know about it? CNN Sport digs up nine items of interest about the southern hemisphere's biggest tennis event. Richest grand slam . Although Wimbledon and the U.S. and French Opens have arguably more prestige than the Australian event, there is no doubt, that in monetary terms at least, the Melbourne grand slam leads the way. And it isn't just the singles champions who will be laughing all the way to the bank after their $2.2 million payouts. The men's and women's doubles winners will each receive $468,000 per pair, while the mixed doubles champions collect $140,000 per pair. Fighting factions . Melbourne is a melting pot of different cultures and nationalities, and has more ethnic diversity than any other city in Australia. When Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis reached the men's singles final against Roger Federer in 2006 he was cheered on by Melbourne's large Greek-Australian community. Sadly, in recent years, nationalistic rivalry has spilled over into sporadic fighting, notably between Serb and Croat fans. The heat is on . As part of the Extreme Heat Policy, which was introduced in 1998, Melbourne organizers have a regulation which is referred to as a ""heat stress level."" The measurement of heat stress is a combination of ambient air temperature, wind speed, humidity and the intensity of solar radiation. When daytime temperatures hit 35 degrees and the heat stress level reaches 28, then play can be suspended and the roofs on two of the main arenas closed for any new matches starting. Nomadic existence . The tournament was initially known as the Australasian Championships, then became the Australian Championships and enjoyed a nomadic existence in its early years. As well as the 56 tournaments in Melbourne, the other 44 have been spread across several cities, including Sydney (17), Adelaide (14), Brisbane (7), Perth (3). Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand's Christchurch and Hastings also hosted it in 1906 and 1912 respectively. Follow the crowd . Once Melbourne was confirmed as the definitive home for the tournament, it soon became apparent that a new site needed to be constructed to accommodate the vast numbers of fans wanting to watch the action. In 1988 the tournament moved to the newly-built Melbourne Park complex and, since then, attendance figures have continued to soar. The main Rod Laver Arena has a seating capacity of 14,820, while the Hisense Arena can hold 11,000. Surface switches . The tournament was played on grass until it left Kooyong. For the first two decades the new playing surface was the green Rebound Ace hard-court material, made by an Australian company, but in 2008 it changed to the U.S.-produced Plexicushion Prestige -- which supposedly retains less heat and has better stability for players than its predecessor. Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the only players to have won the Australian title on both types of courts, while Sweden's Mats Wilander is unique in his wins on grass and Rebound Ace. Famous names honored . The Australian Open singles trophies are named after Norman Brookes and Daphne Akhurst. Brookes was a legendary player in the formative years of the game. He was the first non-Briton to win Wimbledon in 1907, and in 1926 he became the first president of the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia -- a post he held for the next 28 years. Akhurst dominated Australian tennis in the 1920s, winning five Australian Opens before tragically dying of an ectopic pregnancy at the age of 29. Hingis makes history . Martina Hingis was just 16 years, three months old when she beat Mary Pierce in the 1997 women's final to become the youngest winner of a grand slam singles title. Remarkably the youngest men's winner is also the oldest. In 1953, the 18-year-old Ken Rosewall won the first of his four Australian Open titles. The last of his wins came in 1972 at the age of 37 years and two months, making Rosewall the oldest grand slam singles champion in history -- while the 19-year span between his first and last title is also a record. Edmondson's shock victory . Australian legend John Newcombe was expected to stroll to his third Australian Open title, and eighth grand slam success, in 1976. His unseeded 22-year-old opponent Mark Edmondson had been taken to five sets by Austrian Peter Feigl in his opening match but caused a major upset by dumping top seed Rosewall out in the semifinals. Newcombe was the hot favorite to retain his title but, after winning the opening set, Edmondson hit back to take the next three for a stunning triumph. Edmondson went on to become an accomplished doubles player, claiming four Australian Open titles in the 1980s, but he never won another grand slam singles title.","The first grand slam of the tennis season, the Australian Open, takes place in Melbourne .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka made it 15 straight wins in 2012 after she defeated Yanina Wickmayer to reach the Qatar Open semifinals. The Belarusian, who claimed her first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, beat her Belgian opponent 6-0 6-4 in just over an hour. Azarenka, the top seed, revealed a change in her emotional approach over the past year has reaped rewards and propelled her to the top of the rankings. ""Last year at this time I was a little bit of a mess,"" she was quoted as saying on the WTA Tour's website. ""I couldn't control any of my emotions. Ambitious Azarenka downplays the pressure of being No. 1 . ""That's one thing when I came back after Doha to Indian Wells I had to change, my mentality on the court, the way I approach a match, the way I approach tough moments. ""Now, I don't try to think about why something is happening to me. I just try to accept it and deal with it."" Azarenka certainly didn't look under any duress during her victory over Wickmayer, taking the first set in just 21 minutes. ""I would consider the first set as a perfect set. I was really going for every shot I could and everything was working,"" Azarenka said. ""In the second set I had opportunities in every game, I just couldn't convert them. But it's important the way I finished the second set. It was the same way as I started the match."" Azarenka's reward for another impressive win is a final four clash with Agnieszka Radwanska after the Pole beat Christina McHale, from America, 6-1 6-1. Third seed Samantha Stosur, from Australia, also booked her place in the last four with a 6-2 2-6 6-3 win over Romanian Monica Niculescu. The 2011 U. S. Open champion said: ""It's one of those matches where when you are in control, you have to keep going and keep going and keep going, and know you're going to miss a few but you're going to make more than you miss. ""Monica plays a unique game that at times can put you off, but at the end of the day I'm happy with the way I bounced back in the middle of that third set."" Stosur will play France's Marion Bartoli in the semis after the fifth seed defeated Lucie Safarova, from the Czech Republic, 7-5 4-6 6-1.","World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka wins 15th straight match in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Agnieszka Radwanska has beaten Maria Sharapova in the final of the Miami Masters to claim her second title of the year. The Pole's straight sets 7-5 6-4 victory over the world No.2 on Saturday is the biggest of her career to date and moves her up to fourth in the world rankings. The 23-year-old, who didn't drop a set throughout the tournament, now joins world No.1 Victoria Azarenka as the only woman to have won multiple titles on the WTA Tour in 2012. ""I got a lot of good wins this year against top players. I was trying from the beginning to focus on my serve, put my first serve in and go for it. I think I did a really good job today and the serve was the key."" Radwanska said afterwards. Surf and volley: 'The Scud' finds peace . Radwanska needed 57 minutes to clinch a first set marked by few winners and a string of unforced errors. Sharapova's tally of 26 compared with Radwanska's eight eventually told as the Pole broke the Russian's serve in the 12th game. Champion's chat: Sampras talks tennis . Despite being less error-strewn the second set took a similar course with Sharapova -- who has now lost four finals in Miami -- losing her serve in the 10th game to hand Radwanska the title. ""I thought she played extremely well, was very consistent, got that extra ball back and I made that extra mistake. She didn't give me many errors,"" Sharapova said. The victory is the Pole's second victory over Sharapova in nine meetings -- the only other triumph came at the U.S. Open in 2007. The win adds to the title she won in Dubai last month where she defeated Germany's Julia Goerges in the final.","Agnieszka Radwanska wins her second title of 2012 defeating Maria Sharapova 7-5 6-4 .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Thousands of Egyptians gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square Tuesday night to protest what they call a coup by Egypt's military rulers and show their support for the Muslim Brotherhood presidential candidate. Conflicting reports about the health of ousted President Hosni Mubarak overshadowed the protest, as one news agency reported he was clinically dead, which the military quickly denied. ""He is not clinically dead as reported, but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition,"" Gen. Mamdouh Shahin, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, told CNN. Conflicting reports about whether Mubarak has died . ""They're playing with us,"" one Tahrir Square demonstrator said. ""All of the sudden, all of this? If he's really dead, it's God's will. I would hope he lives to see the new president."" Both candidates in what the United States called Egypt's ""historic"" presidential runoff over the weekend are claiming victory, the latest twist in the country's chaotic political upheaval. A spokesman for Ahmed Shafik -- the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak -- said Tuesday that Shafik had won, state-run Nile TV reported. At a news conference, Mahmoud Abu Baraka said the campaign was certain it had the correct numbers. Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, claimed victory Monday and vowed to build an inclusive government. ""No one's rights will be left out of it, and no one will dominate over the other,"" he said. Egypt has not announced an official result. The dueling announcements come amid questions over just how much authority the president will even have in the new Egypt. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has run Egypt since Mubarak's ouster, stripped the position of much of its power. Under an interim constitutional declaration released Monday, the military council retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution can be written and a new parliament elected. The declaration says Supreme Council members ""shall decide all matters related to military affairs, including the appointment of its leaders."" The president has the power to declare war, it says, but only ""after the approval of the SCAF."" That move came days after Egypt's highest court dissolved the lower house of parliament and the military council announced it had full legislative authority. The Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest Islamist group, was the dominant party in the parliament. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The April 6 revolutionary movement and the Muslim Brotherhood called Tuesday's ""million man march"" in Tahrir Square. By evening, a crowd of thousands had gathered in the square, which was the central home to protests that toppled Mubarak's regime last year. Many demonstrators chanted ""Morsi, Morsi"" and waved Egyptian flags and his portrait. Several lawmakers from the Brotherhood stood sweating in the crowd talking to journalists. ""This protest rejects the constitutional addendum and demands that the military council surrender power by the end of June. We object to the military council remaining in power beyond June,"" said Mohamed Gabber, a Brotherhood representative in the Shura Council, Egypt's upper house of parliament. Egypt's highest court last week dissolved the recently elected lower house of parliament, casting doubt over the future of the Shura, which has continued to meet. ""The constitution is supposed to be in the hands of the Egyptian people,"" Gabber added. Earlier, Mohamed el Omda, a former member of parliament with the Muslim Brotherhood, complained that the ""powerful TV channels"" in Egypt are owned by businessmen collaborating with the military council. ""They tried to destroy the image of the parliament in preparation for this step that was taken to dissolve the parliament,"" he said. El Omda stood outside the parliament building, where police prevented former lawmakers from entering Thursday. The military council rejects complaints of a ""coup d'etat,"" insisting it remains temporarily in control until a new constitution is formed. The council said last week it will appoint a council to create the constitution. As for the declaration about the presidency, SCAF member Gen. Mohamed el Assar insisted the position retains ""great authority, very vast authority."" ""And the military council did not take anything away from him,"" el Assar said. But the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, in a statement, said the ""SCAF does not have the right, power or authority to issue any constitutional article -- and indeed it has only ten days before it hands over ruling power to the elected president. ""Ultimately, this announcement amounts to a total coup d'Ã©tat against constitutional, popular and revolutionary legitimacy."" Each side in the election accused the other of voting irregularities and called for an investigation. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday, ""This is a very important couple of days for the Egyptians to get it right, in keeping with their commitment to have free, fair, and transparent presidential elections."" The Carter Center, which monitors elections worldwide, said Tuesday that its mission in Egypt had issued preliminary findings about the runoff. ""The Center noted that the Egyptian people again have demonstrated their deep commitment to the electoral process. However, The Carter Center expressed grave concern about the broader political and constitutional context, which calls into question the meaning and purpose of the elections,"" the agency said in a statement. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said in the statement, ""I am deeply troubled by the undemocratic turn that Egypt's transition has taken. The dissolution of the democratically elected parliament and the return of elements of martial law generated uncertainty about the constitutional process before the election. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces' new Constitutional Declaration, in which they carve out special privileges for the military and inject themselves into the constitution drafting process, violates their prior commitment to the Egyptian people to make a full transfer of power to an elected civilian government. ""A constitution is a permanent foundation for the nation, and must be fully inclusive and legitimate. An unelected military body should not interfere in the constitution drafting process."" U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Anne W. Patterson visited polling sites. She said the United States was pleased to ""participate in the process,"" calling it a ""historic event"" for ""democracy in Egypt,"" the U.S. Embassy in Cairo tweeted. In an interview on CNNI's ""Amanpour,"" Morsi spokesman Jihad Haddad said parliament plans to meet this week -- potentially forcing a confrontation with military rulers and Egypt's high court.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer brushed aside the challenge of Andy Murray on Saturday to claim his fifth Dubai Open title. The Swiss champion and world No.3 won in straight sets 7-5 6-4 in one hour 30 minutes to notch up the 72nd title of his career. ""It's beautiful winning this. It's such a difficult tournament with so many top ten players, and Andy having such a huge victory getting to the final,"" Federer said. Murray couldn't repeat the form which saw him down Djokovic in straight sets on Friday, instead playing second fiddle to 30-year-old Federer. The Scot had a chance to break in the sixth game but squandered two opportunities to edge ahead. Four games later, Federer made Murray pay, breaking his serve to go ahead 6-5 before serving out the set. The 16-time grand slam champion started the second set in similar fashion breaking Murray in the third game, before the world No.4 fought back to level at 3-3 -- breaking Federer's run of 66 unbroken service games in the process. Two games later though Federer was back in charge, breaking the Scot's serve before closing out the match. ""It is wonderful to win five. It's only happened at a handful of tournaments maybe in my career, Federer said. Murray was happy to have achieved a couple of notable victories (Tomas Berdych and Djokovic) during the week, but conceded it was always going to be a challenge facing Federer in the final. ""I was happy to reach the final, though I would like to have gone one better. I think most of the crowd wanted him to win, but it was a great atmosphere,"" Murray said.","Roger Federer claims his fifth title in Dubai with a straight sets win over Andy Murray .

Ivanovic, French Open champion in 2008, was pleased with her form and told reporters she still harbors hopes of reaching No. 1 in the world. ""Well, that's why I'm here,"" she said. ""If I didn't think so, I probably wouldn't be sitting here. But, yeah, I definitely believe so."" Kerber emulates Graf with Paris Open triumph .

"(CNN) -- Golf is a sport where concentration and the ability to perform under pressure is key. So how was Webb Simpson feeling during Sunday's final round of the U.S. Open, knowing he was within touching distance of winning his first major title? ""I couldn't really feel my hands or my legs,"" the 26-year-old told CNN after carding 68 in each of the two final rounds to finish one over par at San Francisco's Olympic Club. ""My legs felt like they were a couple of hundred pounds each ... It was very nerve-wracking."" But the new world No. 5 put together a run of four birdies in six holes in the middle of his final round to move above overnight leaders Graeme McDowell, who missed a 25-foot putt at the 18th to force a playoff, and fellow American Jim Furyk. ""I'm pretty excited, I'm pretty worn out,"" he said, after clinching the third PGA Tour title of his four-year career and taking home the $1.44 million first prize. ""It's such a long week, such a grueling week on your mind, and this place is hard to walk. So physically it's a tough week as well. ""But I couldn't have imagined I'd be U.S. Open champion this early in my career. I didn't expect that it would come this quickly. One thing I've always done is I've never put limits on what can happen with this game."" The North Carolina native, who tied for 14th at Congressional last year in his only previous U.S. Open appearance, is hoping to capitalize on the run of form which has propelled him to one of golf's four biggest prizes. ""You can get on runs out here, you wins and your good play comes in bunches. I want to take advantage of that. One thing I pride myself in is remembering how I got here and remembering what makes me tick as a golfer,"" he said. ""So win or lose I'm trying to get better, and that's what I've been trying to do for the last couple of years."" Simpson said the continued shouts from the crowds gathered on the Lake Course kept him guessing on a foggy day in California. ""This week I felt like they were especially great. I looked at my caddy on 14 and asked him, 'Are the crowds are lot louder today?' because it seemed like we were hearing roars every few minutes,"" he said. ""It was so fun to play in an atmosphere like that. The famous 18th hole, coming down the hill and going back up to the clubhouse, is probably the coolest finish I can imagine in golf."" Despite becoming the third consecutive American winner of a major -- following on from Bubba Watson at the Masters and Keegan Bradley at the PGA Championship -- and the 15th different major winner in a row, Simpson's participation at next month's British Open is in doubt. He and his wife Dowd are awaiting the birth of their second child, and Simpson is looking forward to sharing his tale of Father's Day glory with his children in the years to come. ""I got to talk to my dad and I told him, 'Happy Father's Day,' and he said it was a pretty good Father's Day present for him.

"(CNN) -- Victoria Azarenka surrendered just three games to Samantha Stosur as she claimed her third title of an impressive year at the Qatar Open. The world No. 1 wrapped up a 6-1 6-2 victory over her Australian opponent, showing no sings of discomfort from the injury that she picked up in Saturday's semifinal win over Agnieszka Radwanska . The Belarusian's win in Doha was her 17th straight victory this year, a run that has seen her capture the Syndey International crown and a first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January. Azarenka shrugs off injury to reach Qatar final . It was her 11th career title and cements Azarenka's place as the dominant force in women's tennis in 2012. Last year in Doha, she lost in the opening round to Daniela Hantuchova -- a defeat that caused her to contemplate quitting the sport. ""I am really proud of the way I played today,"" an emotional Azarenka said in an interview courtside. ""I was not 100 per cent after my fall yesterday and I knew I had to adjust my game and everything went according to plan. ""Last year I lost in the first round and watched someone else lift this beautiful trophy. But now I have this for myself."" Azarenka rarely looked in any danger against Stosur, the reigning U.S. Open champion, breaking her opponent three times in the opening set. Stosur continued to make unforced errors in the second set, Azarenka racing into a 3-0 lead. Though the Australian retained two service games, another break sealed the third title of Azarenka's year.","Victoria Azarenka defeats Samatha Stosur to win the Qatar Open in Doha .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Maria Sharapova made a surprise exit from the WTA Paris Open when she was beaten in the quarterfinals Friday by German ninth seed Angelique Kerber. Sharapova had beaten Kerber in straight sets on the way to the final of the Australian Open last month, but was below her best as he slumped to a 6-4 6-4 defeat in the Pierre de Coubertin indoor arena. The Russian was playing her first tournament since losing to new World No.1 Victoria Azarenka in the title match at the opening grand slam of the year. She came through her first match and will rise to No.2 in the world rankings next week, but despite breaking Kerber's service twice in the opening set lost control of the match. World No.27 Kerber broke back twice to forge a 5-4 lead and Sharapova made two unforced errors to hand her the set. Sharapova was also erratic in the second set, again giving up an early break. An backhand which flew out on match point saw Kerber clinch her first victory over a top-10 player. ""It was a tough day because my opponent played really well,"" Sharapova told AFP. ""I did have opportunities but I didn't take them today. ""I was up in both sets and I had breaks but she played extremely well -- much better than I did, in any case. Kerbe will play either Belgian Yanina Wickmayer or German qualifier Mona Barthel for a place in the final. Czech world number 51 Klara Zakopalova beat German sixth seed Julia Goerges 3-6 7-5 6-1 in their quarterfinal. Zakopalova will play Marion Bartoli of France after the second seed battled back to beat Italy's Roberta Vinci, 4-6, 6-4 7-6. Bartoli trailed a set and 1-4 and was down 5-2 in the decider before delighting the home crowd with victory over the seventh seed. In other WTA news, Petra Kvitova has pulled out of next week's Qatar Open with an achilles tendon injury. The Czech will lose her No.2 ranking to Sharapova on Monday, but is resting after a hectic January which saw her win the Hopman Cup in Perth with compatriot Tomas Berdych. She made the semifinals in Sydney and the Australian Open before helping her country into the semifinals of the Fed Cup World Group.","Maria Sharapova exits Paris Open at quarterfinal stage .

"New York (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Irene's swipe at the Big Apple proved Sunday that New Yorkers can be a tough crowd to impress. ""I slept through the whole thing,"" said James Trager, a writer who watched nature's display of fury as it took place outside the windows of his apartment in Midtown and gave a tepid review: ""Nothing. It's exaggerated."" ""I think we're all surprised how relatively quickly the storm blew through here and the rain stopped,"" said Steve Kastenbaum, a national correspondent for CNN radio, who watched the storm from the comfort of his apartment in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn. He said he saw lots of local street flooding and branches in the streets, but few uprooted trees; during the height of the storm, people were walking on the street. ""I even saw one or two folks taking a jog,"" he said. ""I kid you not. Pretty typical for Brooklyn. They're not going to let anybody get in their way."" While the initial effects of the storm were less harsh than anticipated, officials said they were still concerned about flooding from heavy rains that could affect electrical systems and other infrastructure that is largely underground in New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it was not yet clear when subways, Metro North trains and Long Island Railroad lines would reopen. ""The conditions are still too dangerous. We can't put people on bridges; we can't put people in tunnels,"" he told CNN affiliate WCBS. ""Once we get a full assessment, we will give people an idea of when the system will come online."" He praised New Yorkers for taking the storm in stride. ""When we have our darkest hours, New Yorkers shine their brightest, and I think this is one of those times."" But the possibility of worse occurring away from the shore was weighing on National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read. ""The biggest concern, now that (Irene's) gone inland, is heavy rain, flash floods"" and wind damage, he told CNN. Once inland, hurricanes ""start falling apart pretty fast,"" he said. ""Eventually, it will exit out into Canada."" ""Overall, I think we've gotten through this,"" Joseph Bruno, commissioner of emergency management for the city, told reporters in Brooklyn, where the skies were bright. He said the hardest-hit areas were from Coney Island in Brooklyn to the Rockaway area of Queens. ""We have 50,000 people without power. That's pretty good in a city of this size. So, we did well, but we prepared well, also."" ""Nothing really that bad happened,"" said Sarah Sargenti, who spent Saturday night in a friend's walkup apartment in Soho rather than risk getting stuck without elevator service in her 23rd-floor apartment near the financial district. ""A lot of wind and rain."" Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, a CNN contributor who was involved in a leadership role in the recovery efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, described Sunday's hurricane as a six out of 10, with 10 representing Katrina. About 30 miles north of the city, in Westchester County's Sleepy Hollow, near the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson, Tom Sobolik was out early Sunday at the Philipse Manor Beach Club. Though the bridge was shut to traffic, ""the boats here are all fine,"" the photographer said. ""Nobody had any problem."" On Saturday night, he attended a hurricane party in his neighborhood to discuss the brewing storm. ""Everybody just went over how they prepared and how it was going to be a waste,"" he said. ""It turned out to be largely true. The media blew this all out of proportion."" It did not flood the 9/11 memorial site in Manhattan, as many had worried it might. Still, the storm left quite a wake -- sending water from the East River and the Hudson River over their banks for a brief period on Sunday morning and into New York City. The water also led officials to close for a brief time the north tube of the Holland Tunnel, from Lower Manhattan to New Jersey. Earlier, authorities had halted public transportation, closed bridges and tunnels and buttoned up ports, essentially locking down the city of more than 8 million people as Hurricane Irene began to lash the city with wind and rain. And New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged some 370,000 people to evacuate their residences in low-lying areas. In the Long Island community of Long Beach, massive berms were breached by 8 a.m., with water pushing northward into town. The water yanked a lifeguard building from its foundation on the beach and streets were flooded. Bloomberg ordered evacuations for Long Beach Island, including Atlantic Beach, Lido Beach and Point Lookout. The mandatory evacuations, which also affected parts of Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island, were a first in the city's history, he said. CNN iReporter and Queens resident Anne Egan, who was watching events unfold from her house three doors down from the beach wall, said she disregarded the evacuation order because she was afraid of looters. ""You can see the waves breaking on (the beach wall),"" she said. ""I was a little panicked approaching high tide, which was about 7:30 a.m. But now that the peak of high tide has passed us, I'm not as nervous. The waves are just huge out there."" More than 905,334 people were without power in New York early Sunday afternoon, authorities said. In Brooklyn, Seunh Hong watched in despair as the water in his shop's basement rose to his knees. ""Way worse than I'd expected,"" he said. ""It is absolutely horrible. Afterwards we have to spend lot of time and money, (and) energy for fixing them up."" Many in New York began preparing days ago for the arrival of Irene, stocking up on essentials. By late Saturday, most stores, restaurants and bars were closed. The bread shelves were bare early Sunday at the Associated Supermarket on Manhattan's Upper West Side, according to Aaron Herman, who said more than 1,000 people had stopped in Saturday to buy the ""essentials."" By then, the streets were largely deserted. ""For a city that never sleeps, it's clearly taking a nap,"" Herman said. CNN's Tom Watkins, Chelsea J. Carter, Holly Yan, Phil Gast, Eden Pontz, Kristina Sgueglia, Jesse Solomon, Cheryl Robinson, Rob Marciano, and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Katrina recovery veteran ranks Irene as 6 out of 10 .

"(CNN) -- Fourth seed Andy Murray has crashed out of the prestigious Indian Wells tournament in California, beaten in straight sets by Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in his opening match. The British number one lost to American Donald Young at the same stage last year -- and history repeated itself on Saturday when world number 92 Garcia-Lopez cruised to a 6-4 6-2 success. ""My return let me down and he hardly missed the ball either,"" Murray told the official ATP Tour website. ""The level of tennis nowadays you get no easy first round matches and, if you play a poor match, that's what happens. ""I don't know exactly why because I was playing really, really good tennis the whole of the week and the buildup to it,"" added Murray, who made 34 unforced errors and had his serve broken three times in a one hour, 40 minute defeat. A delighted Garcia-Lopez said: ""It's one of the biggest wins in my career and it gives me a lot of confidence, as my ranking right now is not too good. ""This victory gives me some confidence that I can do much better this season,"" he continued. There were no such problems for world number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic, who beat Kazakh qualifier Andrey Golubev 6-3 6-2, the same player he defeated in his opening match in last year's tournament. The Serb told reporters: ""There were a lot of unforced errors but it was the opening match and I am still trying to adjust to this court and get used to the conditions."" There were also wins for seventh seed Tomas Berdych and eighth seed Mardy Fish, but amongst those to also go out were Richard Gasquet, Kei Nishikori and Florian Mayer -- seeded 16th, 17th and 18th respectively. All the top names in the women's draw moved through into the next round, with holder Caroline Wozniacki particularly impressive in trouncing Ekaterina Makarova on Russia 6-2 6-0. The fourth-seeded Dane was joined in the next round by second seed Maria Sharapova and sixth seed Samantha Stosur, who also enjoyed straight sets wins. The biggest surprise in the women's section saw 11th seed Sabine Lisicki go down 6-1 6-4 to Lourdes Dominguez of Spain.","Fourth seed Andy Murray beaten in his opening match in Indian Wells event .

"(CNN) -- Australian maxi Wild Thing survived a collision with a spectator boat as the Rolex Sydney-Hobart yacht race got off to a spectacular start on Boxing Day. Wild Thing, skippered by 2003 line honors winner Grant Wharington, was keen to lead the annual classic leaving Sydney Harbor on Sunday. But a coming together with a small craft, which contained media representatives, put paid to that hope. Official race website . Wild Thing was forced out early last year through mast problems, but fortunately there was no repeat, as Wharington reported only light damage.
