"(CNN) -- Two years ago, a major earthquake struck near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. Up to 3 million people were killed, injured or displaced. In the wake of this disaster, aid flowed in via many channels -- including, notably, individual donations sent via text message. The Red Cross immediately launched a donate-by-text program, promoted heavily by the U.S. State Department and the mainstream media. Relief agencies collected $43 million in donations via text after Haiti quake -- sent $10 at a time by texting the word ""HAITI"" to the shortcode 90999. (The donation appeared as a charge on donors' phone bills.) Who are these mobile givers? What motivated them to give, and did their donations to Haitian earthquake relief influence their future patterns of giving? The Pew Internet and American Life Project on Wednesday released an in-depth study based on interviews with 863 people who sent donations to Haiti via text message. Pew found that most of these donations were made on impulse -- an immediate response to media coverage of the disaster, especially on television. For three-quarters of them, it was the first time they'd ever donated via text message. Only a third of them made additional text donations to Haitian earthquake relief. By and large, these donors did not research this donation beforehand. Also, their interest in Haiti's recovery waned quickly: More than half of the donors interviewed reported that they have not followed Haitian relief and reconstruction efforts much or at all since making their donation. Still, their willingness to donate to disaster relief by text did increase and that has benefited the victims of later disasters. According to Pew, ""More than half of the donors surveyed have made text message contributions to other disaster relief efforts since their Haiti donation. Two in five of these donors (40%) texted a donation to groups helping people living in Japan following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, 27% texted a donation to groups helping people living in the U.S. Gulf region following the 2010 BP oil spill, and 18% texted a donation to groups helping victims of the 2011 tornadoes in the U.S. Taken together, 56% of Haiti mobile givers in our sample made a contribution to at least one of these events."" These donors reported also making donations by other channels: online web forms, by mail, and in person. But, interestingly, their least favorite donation channel was over a voice phone call. What's special about mobile donors? Pew found that they're much like the average American, except that they tend to have more technology. For instance, nearly one-fourth of mobile donors own an e-reader, compared with just 9% of U.S. adults. (Very similar figures apply to tablet ownership.) Also 82% own a laptop computer, vs. 57% for the general population. Mobile donors tend to do more things with their phones than the average American. Nearly three-quarters access the Internet from their phone, vs. 44% of the general population. More of them also use their phones to shoot photos or video or use e-mail. Two-thirds of the Haiti text donors were female, and they tend to be more highly educated than the general population. Two-thirds also were white. Pew noted a significant social aspect to mobile giving -- but it's not about social media. Just over 40% of mobile donors reported encouraging friends and family to donate by text to Haitian earthquake relief. These efforts were surprisingly successful. According to Pew, ""76% of these 'encouragers' say that their friends or family members did indeed make a contribution to earthquake relief using their phones. Nonwhite and young donors were particularly likely to spread the word among their friend networks."" But even though mobile donors are more likely than the average American to use social media, most of this encouraging happened in face-to-face conversations, not online. ""Of those who encouraged a friend or family member to contribute, 75% did so by talking with others in person, and 38% did so via voice call. By comparison, 34% encouraged others to contribute by sending a text message, 21% did so by posting on a social networking site and 10% did so via email."" People can donate by text message to all sorts of causes and campaigns. Many services such as mGive and MobileCause.org provide text-to-give services for nonprofits and campaigns. It's unclear whether the patterns Pew spotted in the Haitian relief text donors would apply to donations for causes other than disaster recovery -- but this field is growing fast. In 2012, Americans should expect to be pelted with more text-to-give pleas than ever -- especially if you live in California or Maryland, which are moving forward to allow political contributions by text. So far, text donations are not allowed for federal political campaigns, including the presidential race. In December 2010 the Federal Election Commission ruled that those campaigns could not receive donations via text message. This would circumvent disclosure laws for political contributions -- currently anyone who gives more than $200 to a federal campaign must list their occupation and the name of their employer. However, the Huffington Post reported on frenzied efforts under way to enable cell phone campaign donation methods that do not rely on text messages. Stay tuned on that front. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Disaster relief groups collect $43 million in donations via text after Haiti quake .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For Lilly Ledbetter, it was a day of vindication over a decade in the making. President Obama stands with Lilly Ledbetter shortly before he signed the bill bearing her name Thursday. More than 10 years after first filing a gender discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the beaming retired grandmother from Alabama stood in the East Room of the White House, watching the president of the United States sign a landmark piece of pay-equity legislation bearing her name. ""I cannot begin to describe how honored and humbled I feel today,"" Ledbetter said Thursday. ""When I filed my claim ... never, never did I imagine the path that it would lead me down."" Under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, victims of pay-based discrimination will now have the right to file a complaint to the government within 180 days of their most recent paycheck, as opposed to within 180 days of their first unfair paycheck. The law's supporters argue the change was necessary because, under the old standard, an employer merely needed to hide unfair pay practices for a few months before being able to continue them, without penalty, forever. Ledbetter's contribution to the long struggle for women's rights and equal pay did not come easily. It took three presidential campaigns, years of arguing and persuasion in the halls of Congress, and seemingly endless rounds of litigation. It also took the help of a stranger. ""I did not learn of the pay discrimination until late in my career,"" Ledbetter, a former employee with Goodyear Tire and Rubber, said during an interview with CNN. ""Someone left me an anonymous note in my mailbox at work showing my pay versus three males. And we four were doing the exact same job."" Ledbetter retired after 19 years working for Goodyear in Gadsden, Alabama. She filed a complaint with the EEOC in March 1998, alleging that men in her plant doing similar work were paid 15 to 40 percent more. The records backed her up. Ledbetter proved that she was being paid $6,000 less than men doing the same work, including those who were the lowest paid in their job duties. Ultimately, both the EEOC and a jury ruled in her favor. Ledbetter was awarded $360,000 in back pay. Ledbetter's fight, however, was just beginning. A federal appeals court later threw out her claim, limiting her lawsuit to discrimination that may have happened in the six months prior to her initial complaint with the EEOC. A three-judge panel also dismissed the pay discrimination allegations during that 180-day window. Ledbetter's case increasingly gained the attention of politicians and the public as it climbed the legal ladder. By the time the Supreme Court weighed in with a ruling in 2007, the case was a political football. Most Democrats used it to rail against sexual discrimination; many Republicans warned the case could harm employers. In a narrowly divided 5-4 ruling, the high court sided with Goodyear, concluding that Ledbetter had only a federally mandated 180-day window in which to make her initial claim. Such a ""filing deadline protects employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions long past,"" concluded Justice Samuel Alito. In strongly worded dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg accused her conservative colleagues of being ""indifferent"" to victims of pay discrimination. If women sued only when the pay disparity became steady and large enough to enable them to mount a winnable case, they would be cut off at the court's threshold for suing too late, Ginsburg argued. Her legal options cut off, Ledbetter turned to Capitol Hill. Democrats pushed for legislation -- bearing Ledbetter's name -- to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling and change the 180-day window. They made little headway with the Bush White House. During the 2008 campaign, the Ledbetter Act proved to be a significant point of contention between then-Sen. Barack Obama and Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. Obama emphasized what he called the plan's benefits to working women, while McCain criticized it as a boon for trial lawyers. When Obama won the presidency, congressional Democrats put a reversal of the high court's ruling near the top of their agenda. On Thursday, that piece of the agenda was completed. The Ledbetter Act was the first bill signed into law by Obama. ""It is fitting that with the very first bill I sign ... we are upholding one of this nation's first principles: that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness,"" Obama said at the bill's signing ceremony. ""If we stay focused, as Lilly did -- and keep standing for what's right, as Lilly did -- we will close that pay gap and ensure that our daughters have the same rights, the same chances, and the same freedom to pursue their dreams as our sons."" First lady Michelle Obama also made clear her support of the new law and Ledbetter personally. ""Anyone who meets Lilly can't help but be impressed by her commitment,"" the first lady said at a reception shortly after her husband signed the bill into law. ""She knew unfairness when she saw it and was willing to do something about it because it was the right thing to do, plain and simple."" For Ledbetter, the signing was emotional. ""To watch (the president) sign a bill that bears my name -- the bill that will help women and others fight pay discrimination in the workplace -- is truly overwhelming,"" Ledbetter said while standing next to the first lady. ""Goodyear will never have to pay me what it cheated me out of. In fact, I will never see a cent from my case. But with the president's signature today, I have an even richer reward. I know that my daughter and granddaughters ... will have a better deal. That's what makes this fight worth fighting."" With this win, Ledbetter concluded to a rousing ovation, ""we will make a big difference in the real world.""","Signing of pay-equity law brings woman's 10-year fight to victorious end .

"London, England (CNN) -- When conductor Marin Alsop stepped into a packed auditorium at London's Royal Albert Hall, she became the first woman to stand atop the podium on the Last Night of the Proms' -- a first in the event's 118-year history. Closing Britain's prestigious summer-long concert series is no small feat. During the eight-week run, thousands of music lovers flock to the Proms each night to hear performances from the world's most renowned orchestras. Though the honor is not lost on the 56-year-old Baltimore native, she's far from impressed by the slow progress of achieving gender equality inside the concert hall. Read: 'Slumdog' star: Empowering girls . ""It's really shocking that it's 2013 and there are still 'firsts' for women,"" Alsop says. Still, she believes her historic appointment provides an ideal opportunity to hold a broader discussion about inequality and help the next generation. Sporting a striking red suit, she exudes an unflappable sense of confidence when we first meet in the lounge of her swanky London hotel just a few weeks before the big performance. ""We sort of pat ourselves on the back in our developed countries, ticking off that equality box...but when you look to young girls being shot for going to school [like Malala] this is unacceptable. ""If we don't speak out now about this kind of inequality, the inequality in our own societies continues and we have to keep discussing it and keep bringing it to everyone's attention,"" she explains. Her mood shifts from serious to excitement when she reflects on the moment Proms director Roger Wright first asked her to conduct the final night. ""The 'first woman' thing was missing for me,"" she admits. ""[Wright] said, 'You know it will be a historic evening because you'll be the first woman.' And I said, 'No, you've got to be kidding.'"" Fast-forward a year and her appointment to close the Proms has received copious amounts of press attention in the UK and abroad. But with so few well-known leading female conductors in the classical world, an ever-constant sexism row looms just off stage. Most recently, Russian conductor Vasily Petrenko comments sparked outrage when he told Norwegian newspaper Afterposten that ""Men make better conductors."" Petrenko, the principal conductor of the UK's National Youth Orchestra and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra went further saying a ""sweet girl on the podium can make one's thoughts drift towards something else"" while suggesting that ""when women have families it is difficult to be as dedicated as is required in this business."" Petrenko has since clarified that he was referring to the classical music landscape in Russia and that he was misrepresented, according to reports from the London Evening Standard. Despite the latest incident, Alsop says that things are slowly getting better for women in the industry. ""I certainly think the landscape is more welcoming. But the question as to whether that will translate into more women on the top podiums of the world with the major orchestras, I have no idea."" Born into a family of musicians, Alsop says she was always destined for a career in the arts. Her parents started her on the piano at 2 years old. Just four years later, she graduated to the violin. But it wasn't until age 9 when she witnessed a performance by famed American conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein that she realized her true calling -- to become a conductor. Follow CNN Leading Women on Twitter . She would go on to study her bachelor's and master's degrees in violin at Yale University and at The Julliard School, respectively. Later, Alsop developed as a conductor under Bernstein, her mentor. As the first woman to lead a major U.S. orchestra, to this day, Alsop credits her mentor for teaching her ""to put the music first."" Amongst her many achievements, she has been with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra as music director since 2007. As for her international work, she's led London's Royal Philharmonic, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and since last year, the Sao Paulo State Symphony Orchestra for which she is now the principal conductor. ""I wanted to be a conductor when I was nine ... it seems like overnight success but it was at least a decade of really hard work. Not dreaming that it could be a reality, that this could be my career and my life,"" she says. Alsop remains the only conductor ever to have received the illustrious MacArthur Fellowship -- also known as the ""genius grant"" -- which is presented to U.S. residents in recognition of continued creative merit. With education and youth empowerment close to the American conductor's heart, she initiated a slew of programs over the years. Most notably, she started a fellowship for young female conductors in 2002, with three previous winners going on to become music directors themselves. Read: Space archaeologist reveals lost cities . In a bid to give back to her local community, Alsop launched the ""OrchKids"" initiative in 2008, which aims to provide ""music education, instruments, meals and mentorship"" for young people in Baltimore. For now, Alsop is focused intensely on the Last Night of the Proms when she will be conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in a program that highlights Wagner, Verdi and Britten, in addition to compositions from Bernstein. ""I'm bringing some music of my mentor and teacher Bernstein. There's some American music ... I think there are qualities about being American that I hope I can bring to the situation,"" she says. ""It's like presiding over the biggest party in the country and that's a nice role to have.""","Conductor Marin Alsop is the first woman to preside over the Last Night of the Proms .

"Rome (CNN) -- Missing: One small, round, golden container. Contents: The blood of the late, soon-to-be-canonized Pope John Paul II. If found, please notify Italian police and the church of San Pietro della Ienca. Officers from the Carabinieri, Italy's military police, plan to comb the nearby mountains where John Paul used to vacation before his death in 2005, hoping to find tracks in the snow that will lead them to whoever broke into the church and stole the item over the weekend, Carabinieri Col. Savino Guarino said. But investigators are also searching for the relic -- which holds a square bloodstained piece of cloth about 2 cm (3/4 inch) -- all over Italy, he said. The relic and a golden cross were the only things stolen from San Pietro, located near the city of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo region, church members said. Pasquale Corriere, who helped restore the church, said the sanctuary was closed Friday and Saturday because of bad weather. Corriere suggested the thieves were looking specifically for the relic, since nothing else was touched -- not even the boxes that hold money for charity. John Paul's former secretary, Cardinal StanisÅ‚aw Dziwisz, gave the relic to the church in 2011 ""to thank us for all that we did"" for the visiting pontiff, said Corriere's daughter Franca. ""I think it was stolen by someone very faithful to John Paul II,"" she said. ""Really, I can't imagine who the thieves are. My only wish is that the relic is returned to us as soon as possible."" Guarino wouldn't comment on any possible motive for the theft. He said more than 50 carabinieri will be out searching Tuesday if the weather improves. John Paul II led the Roman Catholic Church for more than 26 years. The church plans to recognize him as a saint in April, along with Pope John XXIII, who is revered for his role in the Second Vatican Council. Man tries to sell stolen brains on eBay .

"(CNN) -- The lieutenant whose firefighters refused to leave their Washington fire station to help a 77-year-old man who had collapsed outside has filed for retirement, a city official said Friday. Lt. Kellene Davis -- who commanded the station at the center of the incident -- filed papers on Thursday to retire from the District of Columbia's Fire and EMS Department, said Keith St. Clair, a spokesman for Washington's deputy mayor for public safety. ""It typically takes 45-50 days for such paperwork to be processed through channels,"" St. Clair explained. Davis did not respond immediately to an e-mail Thursday from CNN, and a call to a phone number listed for her was not answered. She took the step toward retirement five days after Marie Mills held her elderly father in the street and screamed for help. A passerby rushed across the street to bang on the door of a fire station, knowing that firefighters are trained to provide emergency medical help. But they wouldn't leave the station. The same thing happened when two more people tried to summon the firefighters for assistance, according to Mills. ""We looked across the street at the fire station. There was a firefighter that was actually standing against the fire apparatus,"" she told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""Everybody started trying to wave him over."" But the firefighter said he had to be dispatched first. ""I even ran to the curb and said, 'Are you going to help me or let my dad die?'"" said Mills. Later, after an ambulance finally arrived, Cecil Mills died at a hospital. He had suffered an apparent heart attack. Authorities subsequently opened an investigation into the incident, though none challenged Mills' version of events. ""It's an outrage,"" Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said at a news conference, who DC news station WTTG reports has apologized to Marie Mills. ""I was absolutely furious."" According to the Mills family, those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911. Calls to 911 were placed, but a mix-up with the address delayed an ambulance, said Washington Council member Tommy Wells. ""Two things happened,"" he said. ""One was that no one came out of the fire house to help this gentleman. The other is the ambulance that was dispatched was dispatched to the wrong place. This was a number of fiascos."" McClair said Thursday that two employees of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department were suspended with pay in the wake of the incident. The firefighters' union said the incident simply should never have happened. ""We need to find out why it did occur and make sure it never happens again,"" said Ed Smith, president of the DC Fire Fighters Association, in a statement reported by WTTG. The city's deputy mayor for public safety, Paul Quander, has said according to WTTG that authorities will look at the communications and whether ""protocols and procedures"" were properly followed. There are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need, he told CNN Thursday. ""These are people who run into burning buildings. They work in the most hazardous conditions imaginable. ""They cross the streets, they cross highways to get to people. It is understood. It is common. This is why it is so troubling that we did not take the appropriate action in this case. It's right across the street."" CNN's Mike M. Ahlers and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Lt.

"(CNN) -- From humble feature phones to souped-up tablets, mobile devices have become a major player in America's media landscape. New research from comScore shows that nearly half of all Americans now access some kind of mobile media: browsing the mobile Web, using mobile apps or downloading content via a mobile device. Furthermore, mobile users increasingly own multiple mobile devices that they use in various ways over the course of a day or simultaneously, making them what comScore calls ""digital omnivores."" ""Not too long ago, consumers depended solely on their desktop computer or laptop to connect online,"" the report says. ""Now, a growing number of consumers are likely to access a wide variety of digital content across a multitude of devices on a daily basis. ""With smartphones, tablets and other connected devices, consumers have become digital omnivores -- not just because of the media they consume but also in how they consume it. Cross-platform consumption has created a vastly different digital landscape, and it is one that requires insight into both the individual usage of devices as well as the nature of their complementary use."" Digital omnivore? Guilty as charged. Here's how this works in my life: . On a typical workday, while I'm making my morning tea, I'm also downloading that day's audio podcasts to my computer. I sync these up with my iPod so I can listen to the news while I make breakfast and hit the gym. While I'm walking to the gym, a podcast news story captures my interest. I stop on the sidewalk for a minute, pull out my Android phone and do a Google search to find the version of that story on the podcast's website. I scan the first few paragraphs and realize I'll want to read the story later in-depth. So from my phone, I share that story to my Instapaper account (a free service that saves and delivers long-format text content in a format easy to read on a variety of mobile devices). Later that afternoon, on my lunch break, I pull out my Kindle and sync it via wi-fi to my Amazon account. The Kindle downloads my latest Instapaper archive: a few articles I've recently saved, including the article from that morning. I read these while having lunch. One story in that Instapaper batch mentions a new film that sounds interesting, a remake of ""The Thing."" So I pull out my phone, launch the Internet Movie Database app and watch the trailer. I like it so much, I tweet about it and post it to a group of friends on Google+, all from my phone. By then, I've finished my soup, and it's time to get back to work. Notice that I haven't turned on a TV or radio or opened a printed newspaper or magazine at all that day. That's normal for me. Still, I'm accessing comparable (and arguably more useful, flexible and actionable) kinds of content via devices that I can easily carry around anywhere I go. Also: No trees were harmed in the making of this content experience. I don't personally own a tablet (I haven't found one that suits my needs at a price I'm willing to pay), but according to comScore, the emergence of tablets is making the media landscape ever richer and more complex -- and more fragmented. While tablets are still a very small part of the mobile market, comScore says three out of five tablet users get some kind of news on this device, and 25% do so daily or most days. As a journalist, I take that as potential good news -- in the long run. But for now, even though half of Americans are already accessing some kind of mobile content, this contingent is still a long, long way from taking over digital media as a whole. The comScore report notes, ""The share of non-computer traffic for the U.S. stood at 6.8% in August 2011, with two-thirds of that traffic coming from mobile phones and tablets accounting for much of the remainder."" This traffic measurement includes only browser-based page views -- just a subset of all Internet traffic (which encompasses everything from e-mail to app support to streaming video to cloud computing and storage). But still, 6.8% is a soberingly small figure, considering how much media attention mobile technology is getting. In the big picture, for now, digital media still exist mainly in the realm of computers that rely on wired broadband connections. But this is changing fast: IDC recently predicted that by 2015, more Americans will access the Internet via wireless connections (wi-fi and wireless carriers) than ""wireline"" connections (cable modem, DSL, etc.). Where is this trend heading? Among its conclusions, comScore notes, ""Devices influence the way people consume content and it is important to remember that they do not exist in isolation of one another, but have a complementary relationship in consumers' lives."" In other words, it's a bit like drug interactions: different media and communication devices affect us in different ways, especially in combination. For instance, I would have gotten less value from the news podcast on my iPod if I hadn't had my Android phone handy while I was listening -- and less value still if I hadn't been able to read the article I'd encountered that way on my Kindle, when and where that experience was more convenient. (And note that this total benefit did not hinge on me committing solely to any single platform or manufacturer.) In the coming year, I'd expect to see more online publishers, advertisers and service providers experimenting with multichannel cross-platform offerings that support complementary types of engagement through your various (and mostly mobile) devices. Similarly, activists, organizations and communities of all types will develop their own multichannel strategies, both intentionally and organically. We'll probably see some strange bedfellows and blatant missteps along the way. But the ultimate goal will be to create a more coherent yet customized experience that feels ambient, not tied to specific devices. Which is probably good, since this technology keeps changing so fast. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Mobile devices have become a major player in America's media landscape .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to living on the edge, there are some women who have the tenacious spirit to conquer all. Whether it's scaling the world's highest peaks or becoming the first person to cross a dangerous ocean stretch, these extreme sportswomen have smashed records around the globe thanks to their fearless sense of determination. On the heels of Diana Nyad's record breaking swim, CNN takes a look at five sports stars who have reached the very top of their game. Diana Nyad . After 35 years and five attempts at swimming from Cuba to Florida, 64-year-old Diana Nyad has finally made her name as the first person to cross the treacherous Straits. Wearing a mask to protect her from the trip halting jellyfish bites that plagued her last effort, the endurance swimmer is the only person to complete the 177 km (100 m) journey without either a wetsuit or a shark cage. Describing her achievement as 'a lifelong dream,' Nyad, who made her first attempt to cross the waters in 1978, was also congratulated by President Obama via Twitter. Read more: Nyad's next challenge will be a 48 hour swim in New York City . Edurne Pasaban . As a keen young mountaineer, Edurne Pasaban made her hobby into a record breaking profession by becoming the world's first woman to climb all 14 peaks over 8,000 meters. The 44-year-old Spaniard spent nine years working her way to the top of the world's biggest summits before completing her quest in 2010, and was named as National Geographic's Adventurer of the Year in 2011. With the likes of Everest, K2 and Kangchenjunga under her belt, Pasaban has seen some of the world's most beautiful landscapes from a viewpoint only reached by a select few. Juliana Buhring . Guinness World record holder Juliana Buhring is the first and fastest woman to cycle the globe. Her epic journey took her across four continents and 19 countries in 152 days, racking up 29,065 km (18,060 miles) in the process. The intrepid cyclist was also the sole female competitor in an unsupported race from London to Istanbul in 2013, further demonstrating her record smashing prowess. Watch: Juliana Buhring's tough moment . Felicity Aston . Adventurer Felicity Aston became the first woman to ski across Antarctica in 2012 -- a feat she achieved without the use of either kites or parasails. Covering 1744 km (1083 miles) in 59 days, Aston's solo expedition made a change from her group ventures, which have seen her lead teams across the likes of Greenland and the South Pole. Her upcoming mission will see her and two fellow explorers cross northern Europe and Siberia to reach the Pole of Cold -- a three month trip that will cover a whopping 30,000 km (18,641 miles).

Australian free diving champion Amber Bourke only discovered the sport a few years ago -- and yet she has already broken the women's world record, just two years after she began competing. Diving to victory at the championships in Belgrade, Serbia, the former synchronized swimmer set a personal best at 164 m -- although her achievement was bettered just moments later by two fellow competitors. Able to hold her breath underwater for five minutes, Bourke has also beaten several national records in her home country.","Diana Nyad completed a landmark swim from Cuba to the Florida Straits this week .

"(CNN) -- Dubai's aviation industry achieved its biggest milestone to date on Sunday, when the emirate's new airport welcomed the arrival of its first commercial flight. Located in Jebel Ali and part of Dubai World Central, an ""aviation city"" that the government launched as a free economic zone, Al Maktoum International Airport is expected to become the world's largest airport upon completion. Like the emirate's main airport, Dubai International Airport (located 50 kilometers to the north), Al Maktoum International Airport is owned by the government of Dubai and operated by Dubai Airports Company. Although full commercial passenger services were originally scheduled for 2017, the mega project was delayed for years due to the regional financial crisis, and faces a new tentative completion date of 2027.

"(CNN) -- Facebook says it was recently hacked, though it says no data about its more than a billion users was compromised. The company described the ""sophisticated attack"" in a blog post on Friday, saying it took place in January when a small number of employees visited a compromised website that installed malware on their machines. ""As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law enforcement and began a significant investigation that continues to this day,"" Facebook Security said in the post. Facebook, the largest social network in the world, is the latest high-profile site to be hacked this year. Twitter announced a similar intrusion earlier this month, and major news organizations including The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post have also admitted to being hacked. The news sites attributed the breaches to hackers working for the Chinese government, but neither Facebook nor Twitter mention China when describing their attacks. ""Facebook was not alone in this attack. It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well,"" said the blog post. ""As one of the first companies to discover this malware, we immediately took steps to start sharing details about the infiltration with the other companies and entities that were affected. "" Unlike Twitter, Facebook said it has found no evidence that any user information was compromised. Twitter said that user names, encrypted passwords and e-mail addresses for as many as 250,000 users were potentially grabbed by the hackers. It reset passwords for all affected accounts. The string of hacks have primarily exploited vulnerabilities in the programming language Java, which is installed on most computers by default. Facebook said the site responsible for its attack took advantage of a previously unknown Java vulnerability, which Oracle patched on February 1. In January, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert about the security-challenged software and recommended people turn it off on their computers. Apple turned off Java by default for its OS X users as a precaution. Full instructions on how to disable Java on any computer can be found on Oracle's website. If you must use Java, make sure that you have downloaded the latest updates, which include key security patches. Facebook said it will continue to work with law enforcement and others in the industry to prevent future attacks.","Facebook says it was hacked in January when employees visited a compromised website .

"(CNN)  -- President Obama slowly walked across the grounds of Cape Coast Castle, a slave outpost in Ghana where hundreds of thousands of Africans were shipped as human cargo to a life of bondage in the United States, South America and the Caribbean. President Obama and his family toured Cape Coast Castle during their trip to Ghana. ""You almost feel as if the walls can speak. You try to project yourself into these incredibly harrowing moments,"" Obama told CNN's Anderson Cooper. When the president reached the ""Door of No Return,"" an arched gateway with thick doors that would shut behind African men, women and children before they were forced onto slave ships, Obama looked out over the Atlantic Ocean where waves crashed onto rocks. ""Obviously there's a sense of what a profound sorrow must've been felt as people were hauled off into the great unknown,"" he said. What does he tell his two daughters, Sasha and Malia, about slavery? ""You try to explain that people were willing to degrade others because they appeared differently,"" Obama said. ""You try to get them to engage in the imaginative act of what it would be like if they were snatched away from Mom and Dad and sent to some place they had never seen before. But you know, part of what you also try to do with kids is to get them to imagine themselves on the other side, as being the slave merchant. ""That slave merchant might've loved their children and gone to that place of worship,"" he said, pausing to point to a church on the grounds, ""right above the dungeon. And [I try to] get them to make sure that they're constantly asking themselves questions if they're treating people fairly and whether they are examining their own behavior and how it affects others.""  Watch Obama's interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper » . He toured the site with his family, including first lady Michelle Obama and her mother, who are descendants of slaves from South Carolina. ""I can't imagine that for her, for her mother who is with us ... that seeing that portal doesn't send a powerful message -- the kinds of emotions that must be evoked."" Obama's recent trip to Ghana and the slave-shipping outpost comes on the heels of last month's apology by the U.S. Senate about slavery. The Senate passed a nonbinding resolution that ""acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery, and Jim Crow laws,"" and ""apologizes to African-Americans on behalf of the people of the United States for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws."" Obama called it a ""historic"" resolution at the time. The issue of apologizing for the past has prompted some heated discussion. In an interview that has gone viral on the Internet, Chris Matthews, the host of MSNBC's ""Hardball with Chris Matthews,"" blasts Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee for backing such an apology. ""It makes no sense to me. Why should the whole country apologize for what a good half or more of the country got killed opposing? You're from Tennessee. Maybe you should apologize first before you ask the rest of the country,"" Matthews snaps. Katrina Browne, a descendant of wealthy Northerners, said she always thought slavery was confined to the South, until she began digging through her own family's history. She learned that her family, the DeWolfs, sailed ships from Bristol, Rhode Island, to West Africa, trading rum for African men, women and children in the late 1700s to early 1800s. The DeWolf family brought more than 10,000 slaves from Africa, she said, and eventually became one of the wealthiest families in the nation as a result of its slave-trading business. Browne detailed her family's experience in a documentary last year called ""Traces of the Trade: A story from the Deep North,"" as part of PBS's ""Point of View"" series. ""I'm a firm believer in the U.S. government apologizing because of all the ways in which the government supported and condoned and made slavery possible,"" said Browne, who has also traveled to Ghana to see Cape Coast Castle.  Learn about Michelle Obama's slave roots » . ""What most Americans don't know is the extensive complicity of the North in slavery. The victors write the history books, so the North wrote the history on slavery and very conveniently painted it solely as a Southern sin, whereas in fact the Northern colonies and states owned slaves for over 200 years and were the main slave traders."" She said she found inspiration in Obama's trip to Ghana and the recent Senate apology. The nation needs to discuss the issue of slavery now more than ever, she said. ""Some people think that those of us who are white and believe in the importance of public apologies or public acknowledgements -- [they] feel that we're just a bunch of knee-jerk, guilt-ridden liberals,"" she said. ""I like to say, 'Why wouldn't the government and white Americans want to go out of our way to make things right, including with what is just a very simple human step of offering an apology/acknowledgement?' "" In addition to the Senate apology, states such as Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia have enacted similar resolutions at the state level for their roles in sanctioning and promoting slavery. But many feel an apology is over the top. State Rep. Patrick McDonough opposed an apology when it was considered in Maryland in 2007. A descendant of Irish immigrants, McDonough said an apology is simply a ""mindset cleansing"" for liberals and a potential preamble for reparations. ""It's just a divisive grand-standing issue that makes no sense at all,"" said McDonough, a Republican radio host in Baltimore. ""No. 1, I or my family have never owned slaves. We came to the United States from Ireland long after slavery had been abolished. No. 2, I think the apology has already been given in the way of 500,000 dead American soldiers in the Union Army who made it clear that they didn't approve of slavery and fought against it."" He added that tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers, both black and white, have been spent on programs to help African-Americans over the years, amounting to the equivalent of an apology for a bad institution. ""There is no need for an apology; there is a need for people to come together and work for the general welfare of the nation,"" he said. ""The president, I believe, will pretty soon appoint a czar of apology."" On his trip in Ghana, Obama said the nation and the world should never forget the scourge of slavery because it's still relevant in today's world. ""I think that the experience of slavery is like the experience of the Holocaust. I think it's one of those things you don't forget about. I think it is important that the way we think about it and the way it's taught is not one in which there's simply a victim and a victimizer, and that's the end of the story,"" he said. ""I think the way it has to be thought about, the reason it's relevant is because whether it's what's happening in Darfur or what's happening in the Congo or what's happening in too many places around the world -- you know, the capacity for cruelty still exists."" ""So trying to use these kinds of extraordinary moments to widen the lens and make sure that we're all reflecting on how we are treating each other, I think, is something I want my kids to think about and I want every child to think about.""","Obama's visit to Ghana came weeks after Senate apologized for slavery .

"(CNN) -- Every year the brains behind your favorite reality TV shows flock to Santa Monica, California, to talk shop and honor the best in nonfiction TV. This year's Realscreen West: The Factual Entertainment Forum took place recently over two days; reality TV darling Kim Kardashian was awarded the Hall of Fame Personality of the Year award, while producer Thom Beers, producer of the Ã¼ber hit ""Deadliest Catch,"" was inducted into the Hall of Fame and took home three trophies -- most original concept, best docu-reality programming and the 2012 Award of Excellence. At the forum, CNN's KJ Matthews chatted up two of the most successful reality TV producers: SallyAnn Salsano, owner of 495 Productions, better known as the creator of the MTV super-hit ""Jersey Shore,"" and Brent Montgomery, owner of Leftfield Pictures, also known as the entity behind the successful History Channel show ""Pawn Stars."" The two talked about everything reality TV-related -- from the shows they wish they had produced to the ongoing struggle to find people for their shows to why they get annoyed at all the people who think creating a reality show is easy. They also touched on how long ""Jersey Shore"" might continue, and their thoughts on CNN's decision to partner with celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. CNN: Recently I've noticed that networks which had no reality TV shows are now getting into the reality game. What do you think about that? Brent Montgomery: I love it because that means there are more people for us to sell to. CNN:  Is it becoming more difficult to cast or find people in reality TV shows. Some failed actors are using the route of reality TV to get their name out. Montgomery: That's why you don't cast in L.A. I did ""Blind Date"" in New York and L.A., and every ""Blind Date"" contestant in L.A. was like, ""Here's my head shots and um, when do I get my $100 and what are the chances of me, you know, when do film directors get to see this and do you guys get a lot of calls?"" I said never. ... SallyAnn Salsano: (Steven) Spielberg is not watching ""Blind Date."" I mean maybe but not to find talent. I mean he may be watching it. I don't know. But certainly not to cast his next film. CNN: Have you both gotten better at pitching reality shows to networks since you've had a successful track record with some of your shows? Montgomery: I think so. Because I think you get better at anything you do over the course of time. I think I'm better at knowing the steps that it's gonna take to (make a show with) subsequent seasons and how you'll have to have a show that will have room to grow. Salsano: No one wants a ""one and done."" Not a producer and not a network, because in the end of season one, everyone spends so much time behind the scenes in our offices and at the network level trying to crack it. ... But in the end, you put so much into it that if you can get to season two, then you are off to the races. You know what works and you know what didn't work and then you can move forward. CNN: People watch reality TV, and some people think that some of it is crap, and (it) has led many to believe that anybody can create a reality show. Montgomery: This p*sses me off more than anything because people think because they watch TV they can make TV, and that may sound kind of simplistic, but people may actually think that these shows are very simple. I watch ""Jersey Shore,"" and I know that for every minute of on-camera drama there is probably an hour or two or more of off-camera drama. My show people say all the time, ""Wow, it's just such a simple show."" We work hard to make them look simple! Salsano: Here is my least favorite (expletive) thing. ... You are in the process of deciding if you want to work with someone, and you show up with your camera, and they say you should have been here yesterday it was so funny. OK, well I'm here today, and if I'm shooting a show; I'm not going to schedule good TV. You're telling me you're so great that you should have your own TV show, then go (show me what you've got)! CNN: Sally, can you ever envision the ""Jersey Shore"" (still shooting even in a nursing home)? Salsano: The thing about ""Jersey Shore"" is that there is a guido born every day. ... So for me it's an endless supply. CNN: Which show do both of you wish you had created? Montgomery: I like ""1000 Ways to Die""! Salsano: I'm so crazy because I love, like ""Storage Wars,"" but I (expletive) love ""Toddlers & Tiaras"" so much it hurts. I literally like, (expletive) love it. It's just like crack. I literally can't get enough of that show. Montgomery: Can I change mine? It's ""An Idiot Abroad."" I love that show! CNN: As you both know, CNN recently hired Anthony Bourdain. What do you guys think about that? Salsano: I think it's a great fit. Montgomery: I think it's a great fit, too. I think when you are a network doing something new, why not go after a big name? I'm sure the cross over between your viewers and his show is a high-income viewer. Salsano: I think it's going to be fine. And I actually would like to see the new twist on it. Like I do watch ""No Reservations"" like crazy and I (DVR) it, and I'm into it, but now I'm excited to see what happens on another network.","Heads of production companies behind ""Jersey Shore"" and ""Pawn Stars"" talk reality TV .

"(CNN) --   CNN.com's  Virginia Cha spoke to HLN ""Morning Express"" anchor Robin Meade about overcoming anxiety and her new book, ""Morning Sunshine! How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too,"" published by Hachette Book Group. HLN's Robin Meade was plagued by panic attacks early in her career. Virginia Cha: Looking at HLN anchor Robin Meade, you would probably think she's never had a care in the world. She's been a beauty queen -- no surprise -- a reporter, she's gone skydiving with the president. Someone like that obviously has unfailing self-confidence, right? Well, you might have trouble believing this, but it wasn't always that way. In her new book, Robin shares a story of a time in her life when she actually suffered from anxiety attacks, and she talks about how she worked through her problem. She has come on over from the HLN set to talk to us. The book is called ""Morning Sunshine! How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too."" It's so good to see you. Robin Meade: Thank you so much. I appreciate it, Virginia. Cha: Is it weird being on the other end of an interview? Meade: Absolutely. Absolutely. Exactly -- because you want to throw questions out, but I'm here to answer them. Cha: A lot of people would look at you and say, ""Yeah, easy for her to radiate confidence -- just look at her."" You have this great job and family and everything. How does it work for someone who doesn't have those things? Meade: In the book I talk about how I think for a lot of people, their confidence is based upon what they perceive as their outer appearance. And for me, my self-confidence was built on -- and maybe falsely so -- the feeling that people liked me. That was my power in the world. I had to be liked. So if I felt maybe I wasn't in a position to be liked, my power was gone and therefore my opinion didn't matter as much as a person who perhaps didn't like me. Read an excerpt from ""Morning Sunshine!"" At one point in my career -- about right here. (indicating photo of herself at anchor desk) ... You can't tell, but that's the face of anxiety that you're looking at. You get a lot of bosses in and every one of them is trying to make their mark and do good journalism and they might say, ""Do your job this way."" And you've probably experienced this. And so you fill the prescription of whatever they think it is that a good newsperson or whatever it is that you do for a living. You prescribe, OK, you're going to fill whatever they have said, you must do this. Well, I did it so much that I kind of lost my authentic self. Watch Virginia Cha's interview with HLN's Robin Meade » . Cha: Just a few months ago you jumped out of a plane with President Bush -- former President Bush 41 for his 85th birthday, right? Can you talk to us about that? Meade: Yeah, it's funny. ... Here we are with the Army's Golden Knights, and we're getting ready to jump. It was his 85th birthday and I got invited to go along. And he's cool as a cucumber because he's done this before. One of the newspaper reporters asked me, ""Well, if you had any anxiety issues before, didn't you have anxiety here getting ready to jump out of a plane?"" Most of us would, right? Well, lucky or unlucky for me, however you look at it, I was not able to put my mind on the actual jumping-out part because I had to think about the interview beforehand. And then as we were jumping there were live cameras rolling so I had to think about, as I'm falling to earth, what I would say when we landed. There would be live cameras. So, lucky for me I didn't actually have to go, ""I'm falling now!"" Cha: Exactly. So the key here is to have your mind on other things. Meade: I was distracted. But I think it was a nice complete circle of where I've been on my journey through self-confidence and anxiety. To actually jump out of a plane and not really have to worry about panic.","HLN's Robin Meade's new book describes how she overcame anxiety attacks .

"(CNN) -- ""So long, Lolong."" That was the phrase echoing around social media on Monday after news emerged the night before that Lolong, the world's largest crocodile in captivity, had died in the southern Philippines. The outpouring of online shock and grief over the demise of the heavyweight reptile, which was more than 6-meters (20-feet) long, could be considered a little surprising, given suspicions Lolong may have been involved in at least two lethal attacks on people before he was captured in 2011. But his world-beating size earned him an entry in the Guinness World Records and drew tourists to his enclosure at the Davao Crocodile Park in a remote corner of the Philippine island of Mindanao. His death, the cause of which is still to be determined by a post-mortem, prompted tributes from top Philippine officials. Environment Secretary Ramon Paje called it a significant loss to the country's crocodile conservation program, describing Lolong as an ""ambassador,"" according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN News. But the 1,075-kilo (2,370-pound) crocodile's legacy will live on, Paje said, since officials plan to preserve his capacious skin so that it can be stuffed and mounted. Wildlife authorities caught Lolong in September 2011, the result of a long effort to track him down after a young girl was reportedly killed in the Agusan Marsh on Mindanao in 2009. The later disappearance of a fisherman from the nearby village of Bunawan was also linked to crocodiles. Attacks on livestock were also reported. But it was unclear if Lolong, a saltwater crocodile, was responsible for the attacks, so authorities made him the star of the show at the crocodile park near Bunawan. He was reportedly named after local hunter Ernesto ""Lolong"" Conate, who died of a stroke while helping plan the capture of the gargantuan creature. Before the giant crocodile died, park attendants had noticed that his right stomach was bloated, Edwin Elorde, the mayor of Bunawan said, according to ABS-CBN. Elorde expressed support for the idea of preserving Lolong, so that villagers ""can still see him.""","A post-mortem is being carried out to determine the cause of death .

"(CNN) -- With the under-construction One World Trade Center fast approaching its final height, President Barack Obama visited the New York tower Thursday to get an update on its growth and help prepare one of the finishing touches. ""It looks beautiful,"" the president said to first lady Michelle Obama as they stood at a window on the 22nd floor and looked down on the National September 11 Memorial and Museum being built below. Obama flew into New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport in the late afternoon and traveled by motorcade to the construction site for a briefing on the building, currently 104 stories and 1,300 feet tall -- already the tallest structure in New York. A view from above: How WTC workers prepared for Obama . He was joined by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Obama also visited with workers representing over 60 labor unions working on the site as he signed one of the final steel beams to be installed as part of the building's framework at the top of the tower. ""We couldn't be prouder of you guys,"" Obama told them. ""This is what the American spirit is all about."" According to reporters at the scene, Obama wrote on the steel beam: ""We remember we rebuild we come back stronger! Barack Obama "" The visit to the Lower Manhattan site is Obama's fourth. He last visited it in September to mark the 10-year anniversary of the 2001 attacks by al Qaeda that killed more than 2,000 people and destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Under construction since 2006, One World Trade Center surpassed the Empire State Building (1,250 feet) as the city's tallest structure in April. The tower's builders say it will surpass Chicago's Willis Tower as the tallest building in the United States, with a final height of 1,776 feet -- a nod to the year of the Declaration of Independence. One World Trade Center is expected to be completed next year or in early 2014. Obama's visit was the first of his three New York stops on Thursday. He'll attend two fundraisers in the evening -- including one at the residence of actress Sarah Jessica Parker -- before he returns to Washington late Thursday night.

"Kabul (CNN) -- On the outskirts of Kabul, behind a high wall is a building that used to serve as a school classroom. On the outside, painted on the dusty gray walls, are murals of brightly colored animals. Inside on the worn-out carpet sits a family, huddled together. Masoma smiles shyly as we enter the room. The 25-year-old mother of two invites me to sit on a deep red cushion, used at night for their bedding. Her children -- five-year-old Ali and eight-year-old Mohammad --- sit close to their grandmother, Zahra, who looks much older than her 54 years. Masoma's sister, 20-year-old Fatima, and older brother Husain, 27, lean against the wall looking on as we set up for the interview. They may look like any normal Afghan family, but they're hiding a shameful secret: They're all addicted to opium, the main ingredient of heroin. It is a drug so prevalent that one million Afghans are addicted to it -- that's 8% of the population, according to the United Nations. ""It's very bad,"" explains Masoma. ""At first when I started to use the drug, it was like a medicine for pain relief after my husband died. But when I became completely addicted and needed it every day, I knew I had to search for a way to stop all this."" Masoma's mother, sister and older brother also used the drug to dull their pain when Masoma's younger brother died soon after her husband. They too became addicted. ""It made us feel calm and gave us comfort,"" says Masoma. ""When I felt bad about my husband and younger brother, using opium decreased my sorrow."" After inhaling the additive smoke that often swirled around the house, Masoma's two young children soon became addicted, without her even realizing. Read more: Afghan infants fed pure opium . ""I feel shame,"" she tells me as her mother weeps in the background. ""I always say to myself, why did I do this? Why didn't I think about my children, my future? People want nothing to do with us."" That was until Laila Haidari found them. The local Afghan woman set up Mother Camp in the abandoned school about a year ago. It's a place for drug addicts to live, escape their destructive environment and hopefully get clean. She and her small team of volunteers offer counseling to help the addicts become ""mentally strong."" There is no government assistance to fund the program. Instead the profits from a restaurant she owns keep Mother Camp running. ""I was sick of seeing all these drug addicts. They used to congregate under the Pol-e-Sukhta bridge, near Kabul University,"" she recalls. ""The people where in such bad condition -- hundreds maybe more were there every single day. The police moved them on so now they're spread out all over the city. But nobody is there to think about their life and take care of them, so that's when I came up with idea to start Mother Camp."" Read more: U.N.: Afghanistan 'world's biggest producer of hashish' She admits that not everyone is cured by the time they leave the program. In fact many return to their former lives, but she says she has to try and help these people who've lost all hope. ""Nobody is helping people in my country,"" she says. ""Everything is so wrong here. The government is corrupt, which means society is also corrupt."" In another suburb, close to the slums of Kabul, is a methadone clinic operated by Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World). It's the only clinic in Afghanistan that is allowed to dispense methadone --- a substitute for heroin. Some 71 addicts registered on the program arrive each day to receive the methadone -- a liquid poured into a small paper cup and drunk once a day. Program director Ernst Wisse says this is the best and most effective way to get drug addicts off heroin. It also eliminates the use of needles and dramatically reduces the risk of HIV spreading. ""What we fear is that this epidemic, we have a concentrated epidemic of HIV among the entire population... if this grows, and it will grow if you don't put any effective intervention into place, then automatically it will get out of hand and then there's nothing you can do,"" he says. Two years ago, the Afghan government allowed Medecins du Monde to expand the methadone program to 200 clients. Several months later they shut it down, Wisse says, claiming they hadn't decided if this was the best form of treatment. ""This decision means there are only 71 clients under methadone in the whole of Afghanistan,"" explains Wisse. ""The drug addiction problem in Afghanistan is enormous and growing and unless they extend the program, the situation is only going to get worse."" Watch video: Drug addiction rampant on Kabul's streets . In a small room at the back of a clinic is a bed for addicts who walk in off the street. The program has been able to take a new patient because one of the registered addicts came off methadone. Wisse introduces me to 38-year-old Asadullah who has just arrived. He gets off the bed and shakes my hand -- a huge smile reveals his missing teeth. What teeth he does have are black and decaying. Asadullah decided to come to the clinic after meeting the outreach team of Medecins du Monde. Several times a week, the health workers visit areas around Kabul where drug addicts live and hand out clean needles, sterile swabs and offer counseling. ""I know these people, they used to give me clean needles. They kept telling to come to the clinic and finally I did,"" he proudly explains. ""I feel better now, because the methadone is a replacement of the drug -- it gives us a better feeling. I want to use methadone until I forget about drugs completely and to find a good way to start a normal life again."" Asadullah has been using heroin for the past 14 years, supporting a habit of three grams a day, which costs about US$24. But the father of four says his family has had enough, and has told him he has to get off drugs or they won't support him any longer. ""Drugs are ruining my life. It's a bad thing in our society,"" he says. ""I also have got bad effects from drugs and my family has also been affected -- that's why I need to stop this."" One man who now works at the clinic knows exactly what Asadullah is going through. Raheem, 48, was one of the first patients to arrive at the clinic two and a half years ago. ""I'd been using drugs for 17 years. I started when I was in a prison in Iran,"" he says. ""During that time I faced a lot of problems and difficulties. I didn't have any information or contact with my family and that's when I started to use heroin. ""When I got out of prison someone told me methadone was coming to Afghanistan and I wanted to get on the program. Now I don't even use methadone."" Raheem's journey is inspiring but sadly it's the rare exception in Afghanistan, not the rule.","Family of seven addicted to opium seeking treatment in Kabul .

"(CNN) -- Unrest and dissension rolled across Egypt on Friday as authorities killed two Muslim Brotherhood members during a gunfight and clashed with protesters in several cities. Egyptian security forces killed the Muslim Brotherhood members during a gunfight in the Nile Delta, north of Cairo, the state news agency MENA reported Friday. Several men attempted to torch a traffic checkpoint and opened fire on police guarding a highway connecting the cities of Tanta and Al-Mahalla Al-Kubra in the northern governorate of Gharbiya, MENA said. One assailant was arrested, but the others escaped, the report said. Egyptian police dispersed protests organized by supporters of former President Mohamed Morsy in various cities, arresting a number of protesters. In Fayoum, police fired tear gas to disperse a demonstration. Police officials said they arrested five protesters, including a student, and confiscated a weapon. Seven people were injured. Police dispersed protests in Damietta, arresting four people. Police said they confiscated knives and images of ""the four-fingered sign"" from protesters, a reference to the image of a yellow hand used by many Morsy supporters. Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with opponents in Damietta, according to reports. A number of shop windows and one car were slightly damaged in the clashes. Several pro-Brotherhood demonstrators were arrested during protests in the northern port city of Alexandria, security officials said. The group said in a statement on Facebook that one protester was killed in Alexandria. However, the city's security chief, Nasser El-Abd, has not confirmed the allegation. Security forces fired tear gas at dozens of pro-Morsy protesters gathering in the northeastern Cairo district of Nasr City and in Giza's Haram district. In Ain Shams in eastern Cairo, Al-Ahram Arabic news website reported clashes on Friday afternoon between about 300 Morsy supporters and riot police. Protesters denounced the presidential candidacy of former military chief Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, chanting against the police and the army. The former field marshal, whose popularity has skyrocketed since he led Morsy's ouster, is expected to win the May presidential election. Egyptian authorities have officially designated the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, accusing it of links to Islamist militants. The group denies any links to violence and insists that its means of protest are all peaceful. Attacks targeting police and the army have spiked since the military ousted Morsy last summer amid massive nationwide protests against his rule. An ongoing crackdown on his Islamist supporters has left hundreds killed and thousands behind bars. The government says that nearly 500, mostly police officers and troops, have since been killed in shootings, bombings and suicide attacks.","Egyptian authorities said Muslim Brotherhood members tried to torch highway checkpoint .

"(CNN) -- Could you catch a wild gorilla? What about a person dressed as a gorilla? This week, staff at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo practiced capturing escaped animals by chasing around one of their colleagues wearing a gorilla suit. Visitors gaped as scores of helmet-wearing keepers surrounded the ""gorilla"" with cars and nets. Staff then pretended to tranquilize their coworker, who swooned dramatically and collapsed to the ground. The acting ape was immediately wrapped in a large net and hauled away on a truck. The escaped animal drill at the Tokyo zoo is conducted every other year, and this time zookeeper Natsumi Uno was chosen to wear the animal costume. ""In our work there may be times when we need to capture an animal, but we would never be the ones being captured,"" Uno told reporters. ""So I tried to feel what an animal might feel and realized when they were on the run they would be scared. That's how I felt."" But some onlookers were barely moved. One Japanese user posted on Twitter, ""Ueno Zoo's escape drill wasn't tense at all."" Another wrote, ""The gorilla escape drill was so laid back! Made me laugh."" The practice is part of the city's earthquake preparedness drills, where city workers prepare for scenarios that may occur in the event of an earthquake. That includes capturing raging beasts. In the past, the Ueno Zoo has tried using different animal outfits: In 2004, two men ran around the zoo while wearing a giant papier-mâché rhinoceros over their heads. The technique isn't just Japanese -- in 2012, the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, Massachusetts practiced capturing an employee in a giraffe costume. The year before that, zookeepers in China ""caught"" a man dressed as Tigger from the ""Winnie the Pooh"" cartoon. Of course, real animals are more difficult to catch. When an actual monkey escaped from the Ueno Zoo in 2010, it took six hours before officials finally netted it in the basement of a neighboring restaurant.","Japanese zoo practiced capturing escaped animals by chasing colleague in gorilla suit .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A few hundred protesters gathered Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, calling for a civil state and an end to military rule. The rally began after iftar, the evening meal that marks the breaking of the fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, and was organized by Egyptian activists, political groups and a few of the country's Sufi orders. It was a protest meant not only to highlight the importance of unity, but also to contrast the message of a massive demonstration that took place in the same location in late July -- one that had brought out tens of thousands of Islamists demanding the implementation of Islamic law in Egypt. During Friday's rally, many participants chanted slogans such as, ""No terrorism, no sectarianism, Egypt is a civil state,"" ""Peaceful, peaceful"", and ""Down with military rule."" Egyptian Sufi leader Alaa Eddin Abu el-Azayem, who addressed the crowd later in the evening, told his audience, ""An Egyptian civil state is the only choice for Egypt."" Sufism is a mystical branch of Islam. Brief clashes broke out earlier between protesters and security forces -- at one point both sides were throwing rocks and bottles at one another. Calm was restored a few moments later. Last Friday, a non-violent protest in Tahrir Square quickly turned chaotic, as the demonstrators were chased by military through surrounding streets.","Friday's protest was meant to contrast one in late July .

"(CNN) -- In Afghanistan's historic presidential election, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah is leading the early returns from last week's voting, the country's Independent Election Commission chairman said Sunday. Abdullah has 41.9% of the vote, according to Ahmad Yousuf Nuristani, who cautioned that it was too early to tell if a single candidate would get the majority of the vote needed to win the presidency without a runoff. Former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani was second with 37.6% of the vote, officials said. Ballots are being hand-counted across the nation, and results will take time to tally. About 7 million Afghans voted in the elections on April 5, in the country's first democratic transfer of presidential power, choosing a successor to outgoing President Hamid Karzai. He is constitutionally required to step down. A large number of Afghans turned out last week, in the third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Voter registration started almost a year ago and 2.5 million names were added to the electoral roll. According to the election commission, polling hours were extended to allow everyone in line to vote. ""Today I came here to select my next president and I hope whoever it is ... is a good person, who will help the people and bring changes to Afghanistan,"" a voter at a polling station told CNN. Another, in Kabul, said the president must secure the war-torn nation. ""We need a good president so the bombings and war stops,"" the voter said. ""I want my children to go to school without fear."" While Afghans cast their ballots, there was heavy security in the capital, Kabul, and throughout the nation. The Taliban had threatened to disrupt the process and punish all involved in the election. About 20 people were killed in violence across the country on Election Day, Afghan Interior Minister Mohammad Umer Daudzai told reporters, and at least 43 people were wounded in attacks targeting voting centers. Most of the wounded, he said, were civilians. Abdullah told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in February that if he won the presidency, he would sign an agreement to keep international forces in Afghanistan and aid dollars coming into the nation. NATO troops are scheduled to draw down from Afghanistan by the end of the year. Karzai has refused to sign the bilateral agreement, also known as the Status of Forces Agreement.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli security forces halted Palestinian Christians -- joined by a U.N. envoy -- participating a pre-Easter procession Saturday in Jerusalem's Old City, an action the envoy sharply criticized but that an Israeli official dismissed as a ""non-event."" Robert Serry, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, was among a large, tightly packed group trying to walk together on what is Holy Saturday on the Christian calendar. A woman yells out at one point, ""They are preventing us from accessing our churches to pray."" Some time later, the people are stopped by security forces. Barricades are set up, only to be picked up and taken away. There's also some pushing and shoving before the scene eventually calms down. The special coordinator's office explained that the group had intended to move from the area's New Gate to the Holy Sepulchre ""at the invitation of the Palestinian Christian community in Jerusalem."" It said the group had been earlier given ""assurances ... of unhindered access,"" only to have ""the Israeli police refuse ... to allow such entry claiming they had orders to that effect."" Serry expressed ""dismay"" over the incident, adding, ""I call on all parties to respect the right of religious freedom, granting access to holy sites for worshippers of all faiths and refraining from provocations, not least during the religious holidays."" Yet Israel's government saw the matter in a different light. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor -- in a message retweeted by Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner -- said, ""UN envoy #RobertSerry shows poor judgment in fabricating an incident out of a non-event, mishandling sensitive issue of religious freedom."" Palmor told the Jerusalem Post that police were acting to limit the number of those packed into the church and the narrow streets around it, dismissing what happened as ""a micro-incident."" This incident is not Serry's first run-in with authorities: The U.N. envoy said he was threatened by armed men in Crimea, which broke away from Ukraine and joined Russia. Whatever its origins or conclusions, Saturday's ordeal did not prevent other activities in and around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is where many Christians believe Jesus was buried and rose from the dead. On Saturday, the church once again was home to the Holy Fire ceremony, including the sight of dozens of people holding candles or small torches.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama asked Congress Friday for more power to streamline and reorganize the federal government, a move designed to claim the political middle ground in an election likely to be dominated by questions about Washington's role in the economy. The president asked legislators to grant him the authority to merge agencies that perform similar functions. If that power is granted, Congress would be required to hold an up-or-down vote on the president's streamlining plan within 90 days of its submission. Among other things, the president's plan would combine several agencies that focus on commerce and trade, including the Small Business Administration, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade and Development Agency. Under the move, the Commerce Department as currently constituted would be eliminated. Some of its responsibilities would be shifted to a new department yet to be named, while other functions would be shifted elsewhere. In the meantime, the president is elevating the Small Business Administration to a Cabinet-level agency -- a largely symbolic move that does not require congressional approval. ""No business or nonprofit leader would allow this kind of duplication or unnecessary complexity in their operations,"" Obama told a group of business leaders and administration officials at the White House. ""So why is it OK for our government? It's not. It has to change."" The proposal is designed initially to save up to $3 billion over the next decade, partly by cutting up to 2,000 jobs through attrition, according to the administration. Obama noted Friday that presidents starting in the midst of the Great Depression were authorized to submit federal reorganization plans to Congress for a guaranteed up-or-down vote. That authority, however, expired in 1984. ""When this process was left to follow the usual Congressional pace, not surprisingly, it slowed down,"" Obama said. ""Congressional committees fought to protect their turf. Lobbyists fought to keep things unchanged because they're the only ones who can navigate the bureaucracy. And because it's always easier to add than to subtract in Washington, inertia prevented any real reform from happening."" Obama's plan -- building on a promise made in last year's State of the Union address to streamline government -- could help to place the president in a more centrist position heading into the election, political analysts note. It could also put congressional Republicans in a politically awkward position by forcing them to either accept the plan -- thereby handing Obama a political win -- or reject it and risk ceding a core conservative issue to the president. ""President Obama is trying to counter the perception that he is a big-government liberal,"" said Keating Holland, CNN polling director. ""If he gets his way and can brag about reorganizing the government, that may help him in the fall."" On the other hand, Holland noted, ""when then-Vice President Al Gore was put in charge of a 'Reinventing Government' initiative under Bill Clinton, it didn't seem to affect views of Gore in that regard, possibly because few Americans really noticed."" Skeptical Republicans questioned both the merit and the timing of Obama's announcement. ""Given the president's record of growing government, we're interested to learn whether this proposal represents actual relief for American businesses or just the appearance of it,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""American small businesses are more concerned about this administration's policies than from which building in Washington they originate. We hope the president isn't simply proposing new packaging for the same burdensome approach."" Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said that ""after presiding over one of the largest expansions of government in history, and a year after raising the issue ... it's interesting to see the president finally acknowledge that Washington is out of control."" Republicans frequently cite the rapid growth in deficit spending over the last three years as an example of explosive government growth under Obama. Democrats insist such spending was necessary to prevent a deeper economic downturn. California Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, criticized the administration for allegedly not working more closely with Congress on earlier reorganization efforts. ""I stand ready to work with President Obama on proposals to reorganize federal agencies,"" Issa said in a written statement. ""While I have been disappointed that the White House has not embraced earlier bipartisan congressional efforts seeking collaborative engagement on proposals to reorganize government, I hope this announcement represents the beginning of a sincere and dedicated effort to enact meaningful reforms."" Issa noted a letter sent last March from several congressmen to the White House seeking ""a tentative timeline for development and implementation of (a) reorganization proposal.""

"(CNN) -- Ukraine's Foreign Mnister Andrii Deshchytsya on Monday asserted that the situation in his country ""is almost like ... a war."" With Russian forces effectively having taken control of Crimea, this is Europe's biggest geopolitical crisis for at least two decades. Russia is currently drafting counter-proposals to a U.S. plan for a negotiated solution. This will seek to challenge Washington's support for the new government in Kiev that Moscow believes was installed in a coup and has plunged a significant part of the country into chaos. From Washington's perspective, Russian troops (up to 25,000 would normally be stationed in Crimea, according to Russian state media, but it's unclear how many are in the region now. Ukrainian authorities have said more Russian soldiers have come into Crimea) must pull back from Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is also attempting to secure support for the placement of international monitors, and has also called for Moscow to use its influence to stop the March 16 referendum in Crimea (which was annexed into the Ukraine in 1956 by Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev) on whether it should join the Russian Federation. In seeking to frame Russia's actions in Crimea, various historical analogies with Nazi Germany have been made, including last week by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The use of analogies by politicians in international crises is commonplace. In the complexity and uncertainty of fast moving day-to-day events, policymakers often seek to draw what they perceive as key lessons of the past in seeking to guide and provide rationales for their actions. For much of the period since the 1970s, for instance, many U.S. officials were fearful of ""another Vietnam"" referring to the disastrous U.S. intervention in that Asian country. This tended to reduce willingness to deploy U.S. military force internationally unless any action (such as the 1991 Gulf War) had clear, attainable objectives that could swiftly be achieved with a minimum of casualties. The Vietnam debacle also became a key frame of reference when the U.S.-led intervention in Iraq faltered after 2003. This was despite the fact that the two experiences (Iraq and Vietnam) were dissimilar in many respects, including the nature of the insurgencies, and U.S. objectives in each country. However, the most widely used historical analogy is that of Munich and Nazi Germany. The widely seen implication for foreign affairs of the ill-fated 1938 UK-French agreement with Adolf Hitler is that appeasement with aggressors doesn't work. Numerous politicians claim to have been influenced by Munich, including George W. Bush during the ""war-on-terror,"" Margaret Thatcher over the Falklands conflict, Lyndon Johnson concerning Vietnam, Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet during the Suez crisis, and Harry Truman over Korea. Moreover, the continuing salience of Munich is illustrated by the fact that, only last month, Philippine President Benigno Aquino compared what he claimed was China's recent belligerent behaviour with Nazi Germany's expansionism by openly questioning ""at what point do you say, 'Enough is enough?'"" While military action appears to have been ruled out by Western policymakers in Ukraine, the fact that Munich is informing the thinking of some politicians is reflected in Clinton's comments last week. She noted that ""the claims by President Putin and other Russians that they had to go into Crimea and maybe further into Eastern Ukraine because they had to protect the Russian minorities, this is reminiscent of claims that were made back in the 1930s when Germany under the Nazis kept talking about how they had to protect German minorities in Poland and Czechoslovakia and elsewhere throughout Europe. I just want everybody to have a little historic perspective."" These remarks, which were qualified by Clinton, have been supported by leading Republican Senators John McCain, the party's 2008 presidential nominee, and Marco Rubio, who is widely anticipated to run for president in 2016. McCain has gone even further, asserting that the emboldened stance of Russia in Crimea reflects the ""fecklessness"" of the Obama administration's foreign policy. While some see very strong similarities between Russia's incursion into Ukraine, and Nazi Germany's expansionism, the fact remains that use of analogies can be fraught with difficulty for policymakers. On a fundamental level, for instance, not all military actions end up like Vietnam, while not all diplomatic agreements turn out like Munich. As history shows, there is thus a danger that policymakers misinterpret past crises just as frequently as they learn the right lessons. For instance, Suez and Vietnam underscore how Munich was used to guide or justify major foreign policy blunders by the United States, the United Kingdom and France in the 1950s and 1960s. Another example is U.S. President John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis who was influenced by Barbara Tuchman's ""The Guns of August"" book. This argued that World War I started as a result of miscalculation and mistakes from all sides. Kennedy believed the events of October 1962 were reminiscent of the lead-up to that conflict and, wisely, sought to deploy a range of diplomatic options with the Soviets, overruling advice of military advisers for a quick military strike on Cuba. However, an increasing number of academics now believe that Germany actively sought war, and that Tuchman's thesis is wrong. In this sense, it has been argued that Kennedy's actions (which were prudent in the context of Cuba, and may have saved the world from nuclear war) were based on a misreading of World War I history. In the case of Ukraine, Munich is by no means the only historical lens through which to interpret what is happening in the country. And, even if it were, there are clear differences between the 1930s and today, including in the interdependence of the global economy, wider dissimilarities in the global balance of power, and the fact that Russia has an extensive stockpile of nuclear weapons. In the unpredictability and tension of the current moment, it is certainly the case that, like Kennedy in 1962, calm, clear and careful decision-making is now needed by Western (and indeed Ukrainian) politicians as they think through the array of non-military options they have at their disposal, including sanctions. History can provide an especially useful framework in addressing similar or identical policy challenges, but to avoid potentially major misjudgement attention also needs to be given by policymakers to any significant differences between past and present conditions.

"New York (CNN) -- As weekend temperatures soared over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, New York City saw a sudden increase in shootings, with 26 people felled by bullets in 72 hours -- seven fatally. ""When we have hot temperatures, we see that the crime rate seems to go up,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday. But Bloomberg emphasized that for the year, shootings are down in the city -- 127 since January 1, which is 40 less than the same period in 2012. ""One shooting is one too many, but last week we had the fewest shootings in a decade, including this weekend's shootings,"" Bloomberg noted. A professor says the heat index and the crime rate can connect. ""Lifestyle differences exist between cold weather and warm weather,"" says James Alan Fox, a professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University in Boston. Fox has conducted research on the possible connection between temperature and crime. His findings illustrate how these lifestyle differences can contribute to varying levels of violent crime. ""In cold weather, particularly in blizzards, people stay indoors, and the violent crime rate is lower. When the weather is warm, people are interacting more with others, be they friends, family, or strangers, so there are increased opportunities for conflict,"" Fox says. Fox says this trend continues except when it gets incredibly hot, so unbearable that even criminals become lethargic. ""When it gets to be in the high 90s, especially over 100 degrees, people just go indoors and look for air conditioning,"" Fox said. However, drawing any conclusions about this past weekend may be premature, says Professor Jon M. Shane, assistant professor in the Department of Law, Police Science, and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay Criminal College. ""I would not put too much emphasis on a single spike in weather and the uptick shootings,"" Shane said. ""The reality is that you do not have enough information from this single episode to conclude that hot weather is related to increases in crime--specifically shootings, in this case."" In November 2012, New York City logged a record-breaking ""murder-free Monday"" when there was not a single reported slaying, stabbing, shooting or knifing in any of the five boroughs, according to the New York Police Department. ""It is unusual in a city of 8 million people, but we never read that much into one day,"" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne, who said it was the ""first time in memory"" that the city had such a lull in violent crime. At the close of 2012, Bloomberg hailed New York City the ""safest big city in America,"" giving the NYPD credit. ""The fact that the safest big city in America is safer than ever is a testament to the hard work and determination of the men and women who put their lives on the line for us every day -- and it also reflects our commitment to doing everything possible to stop gun violence,"" Bloomberg said. CNN's Chris Boyette and Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","Bloomberg: ""When we have hot temperatures ... the crime rate seems to go up""

"(CNN) -- Ah, springtime! When a young single person's fancy turns to quiet desperation. The darling buds of April have shaken off their veils of snow, and you, dear reader, have done likewise with your veils of fleece and SAD-induced despair. Months of picnics, outdoor shows and wine-sodden nights in summertime finery (or, at the very least, jean shorts and well-worn wife beaters -- however it is you roll) stretch out before you. Now all you need is someone to share them with, right? Might we suggest spending those last few weeks of mixed-bag weather doing what any red-blooded human does when they're looking for answers: Stay inside and troll the Web. ""I've tried looking online for love!"" you may cry -- quite literally. ""OkCupid was too arty (and unemployed) for my tastes, Match.com was replete with pleats and Wall Streets! And Craigslist, well... I need a shower. In bleach."" We get it. Sometimes you don't really want to wade through suite after suite of suitors to find the perfect co-picnicker -- I mean, we live in a society where we want everything from our coffee to our movies to be instant. So why not narrow down the search a bit via a superspecific online dating site? Seriously, guys, there's someone out there for everyone, and apparently some enterprising developers (just the folks you should trust for love advice) have gone and cataloged them all. Read on for three extremely calculating sites for satiating that aforementioned quiet desperation. (NB: Shared interests don't always equate to true love -- we know this. Mostly we just find these sites amusing.) If you like to sweat on a date (in a nonsexy way) ... From the running track to the weight room to the yoga studio you roam, counting the multiplying packs of your abs, marinating in your own sweat and hoping against hope that that dude -- the one who always parks his yoga mat unnecessarily close to yours, making for optimal ass-viewing -- will ask you to go for a smoothie after the last ""Ommmm."" Usually you're so bold -- you with your hot pink spandex and ability to bench-press your twin bed. But in his presence, all you can do to contain your ardor is assume a child's pose and weep salty, sweat-mingled tears. Well, muscle-bound dear, dry your eyes (and perhaps take a shower, too). There's a dating site out there specifically designed for you: Single Fit People. This free (for the time being) Boston-based matchmaking machine allows folks who like to work out to find other folks who like to work out to ... you know, work out/make out with. The site even organizes events where singles can mingle and run around and stuff. Yup, on this site, a red face is more likely to connote the blush of love, rather than an abrupt cessation of physical exertion. If 'our song' is likely to be super obscure ... In recent years, you have taken to going to shows alone, parking yourself in the corner with a brimming glass of whiskey and a brimming heart -- and no one to share them with. Yes, in the past, suitors have attempted to share your love -- nay, indefatigable PASSION -- for music. But many, obviously intimidated by your vast breadth of knowledge, have left mix tapes half composed (Dashboard Confessional? Seriously?), attempted to talk to you while your third-favorite Seapunk band took the stage, and -- perhaps most unsettlingly -- just put their iPods on shuffle while y'all were making out. Luckily for you, there's a free resource on the market that will help you avoid anyone out there who ""likes everything but rap and country"": Tastebuds.fm. The site allows you to easily port over your musical interests from Facebook or Last.fm so as to weed out anyone not familiar with that most important holiday in the world, Record Store Day. The site even has a feature whereby you can search for events in your area and people to attend them with, so perhaps you can share that whiskey (and heart) with someone special, or at least sort of special, next time around. You're a social media 'ninja' ... You have SO MANY FRIENDS. Seriously, like 10,000 Twitter followers, a million stalkers on Foursquare, and Facebook -- well, let's just say you had to create a Fan Page for yourself after you hit the friend limit. If a potential date wants to get on your radar, they'll have to send you a tweet. You're just so superbusy at-replying, posting interesting articles to your friends' walls and checking into the bodega around the corner each night when you pick up your frozen pizza for one (gotta maintain that Mayorship!). Still, sometimes -- amidst the pings, love-red notifications and badges -- you feel a deep, dark force sucking at your heart. An emptiness even Instagram for Android failed to fill. Somewhere out there, however, there's another soul aching and tweeting and pinging right along with you, and a little site called Tawkify aims to act as your guide through the morass of online social interactions. For about $15 a pop, Tawkify matches up potential soulmates based on their Klout scores (a service that measures your social influence online) as well as other factors, and sets up phone dates so they can get to know each other the only way they know how -- from the comfort of their own cave-like homes.","Here are three niche sites for those who want to narrow the vast online-dating pool .

"(CNN) -- Pamela Rauseo was stuck in traffic on a Miami highway Thursday when her 5-month-old nephew, strapped into his car seat behind her, stopped screaming -- and she knew something was very wrong. ""That was a red flag for me, because the car was at a standstill, and he'd had a little bit of a cold, and I knew that he was congested, so I got really worried,"" Rauseo said Friday of her nephew, Sebastian de la Cruz. She had good reason to worry as she stopped along State Road 836, a six-lane stretch of concrete known locally as the Dolphin Expressway. ""I pulled over on the left, and I jumped to the back to check up on him, and he was out. He was sleeping, and I touched him to stimulate him. I got no response, so I took him out of his car seat, and he was completely limp and turning purple. I tried to call 911, but I was just so nervous, my hands wouldn't function."" Rauseo screamed for help, and fellow motorists responded. Lucila Godoy was among the first. ""I was driving in the middle lane; she was in the fast lane, and all of a sudden I see her, and she's screaming and she's holding the baby and she's putting it up and down,"" Godoy said. ""I just stopped the car and jumped out of the car, and I asked her what was going on, and we started working as a team."" Godoy had taken a CPR course when she was pregnant in Venezuela with her own son, also named Sebastian. ""I didn't even think about it,"" she said. ""I just hold the baby like my baby. ... When I heard her screaming 'Sebastian,' that was hard."" Soon, Sweetwater Police officer Amauris Bastidas stopped and helped the women perform chest compressions on the struggling infant, who resumed breathing on his own. ""Save someone's life -- that's my duty,"" the officer, usually assigned to bike patrol at Dolphin Mall, told CNN affiliate WFOR. ""My duty to act."" Miami Herald photographer Al Diaz was among those stuck in traffic. ""An SUV stops in front of me, and I didn't think anything of it,"" he told CNN affiliate WSVN. ""But I started hearing screaming, and I couldn't tell where the screams come from, and I looked at my phone, and I looked at my radio and I look up again, and a woman pops out of a car holding a baby, screaming, 'Help me! Help me! My baby's not breathing.' "" He went looking for help and found it coming from all sides, then snapped into his mode as a photographer and began documenting what he saw. ""That moment now is frozen in my mind,"" he said. ""That's just the way I see."" But the ordeal was not over. Sebastian stopped breathing again. ""It was like the nightmare started all over again,"" Rauseo said. Bastidas resumed performing chest compressions, ""and the baby finally reacted, and this time it was for much longer -- until the fire/rescue came."" Sebastian was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he was in critical condition Friday, his aunt said. ""We're confident he'll be fine,"" Rauseo said. ""We just need to get to the root of what's causing these issues for him.""","An infant stops breathing on a Miami highway .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Prosecutors in the Oscar Pistorius murder case will make a final push Friday to keep the acclaimed track star in jail after a bail hearing jolted by the sudden removal of the lead investigator. The South African Police Service pulled Hilton Botha from the case Thursday after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him. Botha is accused of chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk in 2011. He is charged with seven counts of attempted murder. The allegations were the latest blow to a prosecution case that has suffered through several miscues during the bail hearing, including admissions that police could have contaminated the crime scene and failed to properly catalog evidence. Prosecutors are trying to keep Pistorius jailed pending his trial on a charge of premeditated murder in the February 14 shooting death of his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, 29. The hearing ended Thursday with no decision on bail and is scheduled to resume Friday. Pistorius, 26, is accused of the premeditated murder of Steenkamp after, according to prosecutors, a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. The sprinter, however, says he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He says he fired into the room in a fit of terror before realizing the person inside was Steenkamp. Replacing Botha . Court officials learned Thursday that prosecutors had restored the charges against Botha in the 2011 incident. The charges had previously been withdrawn for additional investigation, but prosecutors decided Wednesday to proceed, said Commissioner Riah Phiyega of the South African Police Service. Phiyega praised Botha, saying he is an experienced investigator who ""has presented the case of the police well."" Botha was replaced by the department's most senior detective, Vinesh Moonoo, in a move Phiyega said positioned the department for a ""long-haul"" investigation of Steenkamp's killing. During the three-day bail hearing, being held in a dark, stuffy Pretoria courtroom, defense attorney Barry Roux hammered away at the credibility of Botha and the entire police investigation. He argued police had missed a bullet in the toilet of the bathroom where Steenkamp was shot and may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective foot covers. Botha told Roux that investigators didn't wear the booties because they'd run out. Bulelwa Makeke, the spokeswoman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority, said before the announcement of Botha's removal that the accusations against the investigator would be little more than a ""speed bump"" in the Pistorius case. Gallery: Athletes charged with murder . Monumental collapse? In arguments wrapping up Thursday's session, Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistorius' defense team has failed to explain why investigators found two cell phones and the gun believed to have been used in the shooting in front of the shower. That goes to the prosecution claim that Steenkamp didn't merely get up to relieve herself in the middle of the night, but in fact had locked herself in the bathroom with her cell phone to protect herself from Pistorius. Nel also said Pistorius has shown a lack of realization of what he has done and cast doubt on Pistorius' claims that one of the reasons for his extreme fear that night was that he had been a victim of burglary and violent crime in the past. Where, Nel asked, are the court cases from those incidents? Why, Nel asked, didn't Pistorius whisper to Steenkamp or try to wake her up when he heard noises? In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court . In addition to his questions about the bullet and the booties, Roux got Botha to acknowledge during the hearing that investigators had failed to collect any evidence that counters Pistorius' argument that he mistakenly shot Steenkamp. Roux told Magistrate Desmond Nair that the prosecution's case had suffered a monumental collapse. The defense attorney also questioned police claims that a witness who lived at least 300 meters (328 yards) from Pistorius' home had heard a raging argument coming from the home. He also said officers had failed to properly investigate and catalog evidence found there, including ammunition and a bottle of what Botha first called testosterone before backtracking. Roux said the substance is an herbal remedy. Authorities have argued that ballistic evidence shows Pistorius had to intentionally target the toilet to strike Steenkamp, and that evidence shows he was standing on his prosthetic legs when he shot through the bathroom door. Pistorius said in his statement that when he shot through the door, he was feeling vulnerable to an intruder because he was not wearing his legs and had limited mobility. Prosecutors are fighting bail because they worry that Pistorius will disappear if he's released, and they say that he has a history of police encounters that suggest he is a threat to public safety. Pistorius has pledged to stay in South Africa and fight the charges if released, adding that he's unlikely to escape notice as a well-known athlete who walks on prosthetic legs. His family issued a statement Thursday afternoon through Vuna Reputation Management, saying that they ""fully respect the bail hearing process."" ""They understand it is in the full interest of justice that the process associated with the bail application be followed in its entirety"", said Arnold Pistorius, Oscar Pistorius' uncle and family spokesperson. ""We are strong and supportive as a family, for Oscar, but we understand that this is in the best interest for all."" Anger about detention . In other developments, the women's branch of South Africa's ruling party accused authorities of giving Pistorius special treatment by holding him at the police station instead of prison. ""If there is some special circumstance that permits this, authorities must share this with the public as they are setting a bad precedent,"" the statement from the African National Congress Women's League said. ""All should be treated equally before the law no matter your standing in society."" What's life like in a South African prison? Nike pulls away from sprinter . Also Thursday, Nike announced it had suspended its contract with Pistorius, saying it would ""monitor the situation closely."" Nike had already pulled a TV ad featuring the sports star. Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires . Robyn Curnow reported from Pretoria, and Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Washington (CNN) -- Budget cuts from sequestration or overall austerity measures had nothing to do with the Navy using an outside company to screen contractors for access to bases, the Navy chief of operations said Wednesday in response to a scathing federal audit of the Rapidgate program. The audit, made public Tuesday, cited security problems it said were so severe that it recommended immediately closing the Navy Commercial Access Control System -- NCACS -- for security reasons. In particular, the audit said dozens of convicted felons got unescorted access to Navy installations for weeks and even years because the outside company issued temporary credentials to contractors before completing proper background checks. The Pentagon inspector general's audit also found the program, intended to save money, probably wound up costing tax dollars instead. Coming a day after a contractor opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard, killing 12 people and dying himself, the audit amounted to a powerful indictment of security measures at Navy facilities. It also came as Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered a worldwide review of security at military bases. There is no connection between the NCACS and Aaron Alexis, 34, the IT contractor and former veteran who carried out the attack at the historic naval facility 2.5 miles from the White House. Alexis had a different kind of pass that was not issued through the NCACS, the Navy said. However, the audit revealed security loopholes that potentially put personnel at risk at 10 Navy installations around the country that were studied as a sample of the more than 60 located in the continental United States. Navy Yard: storied past, home today to high-ranking personnel . Wasted money . At a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, Adm. Jonathan Greenert told legislators that the Navy would work with the inspector general's office to reconcile the recommendations in the audit, though he stopped short of accepting all of them. Greenert also declared that the decision to use the outside company to screen Navy contractors, while a ""cost-control measure,"" had ""nothing to do with budget shortfalls or sequestration itself."" ""We don't cut budgetary corners for security,"" Greenert said. ""The two are unrelated."" Sequestration comprises mandatory government budget cuts that took effect earlier this year. In response to the audit, legislators said Tuesday that the NCACS should be discontinued. ""This program wasted money, allowed dozens of felons access to installations they should never have had, and utterly lacked competent oversight,"" said Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who requested that the inspector general review the contract after receiving a tip from a whistle-blower in June 2012. ""It's clear that its existence constitutes an unnecessary danger to the Navy and its personnel and it should be discontinued immediately."" Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN that the audit caused ""great concern"" because ""the report itself specifically says that people at these facilities remain at risk as long as this system is in place."" In its formal response to the audit, the Navy accepted some recommendations for further review and analysis of the NCACS but it rejected the call to end the program, saying it meets all federal requirements for background checks. Discontinuing the program that handled more than 14 million safe visits would result in ""unnecessarily long lines"" at access points to Navy installations, the Navy response said. Called Rapidgate by its operating company, Eid Passport, the NCACS began screening and credentialing for most contractors and other commercial workers at Navy bases more than two years ago. While the military issues credentials to its personnel, NCACS handles workers from government contractors who choose to pay a fee for credentials in a process that includes a background check. Contractors unwilling to pay the fee can apply for day passes, while the Rapidgate system offers up to a year of unfettered access. Audit reports Navy risked security to cut costs, says source . Almost 300,000 contractors enrolled . According to the audit, there were 9,657 companies and 64,924 individuals enrolled in Rapidgate near the end of 2011. As of March 1 of this year, the numbers had grown to 30,702 companies enrolled with 298,204 individual participants, it said. Many of the contractors got interim passes while Eid Passport was still conducting a background check required by military regulations, and others got full credentials without having been fully vetted as required through the National Crime Information Center database and the Terrorist Screening Database, the audit said. In addition, seven of the 10 bases visited by auditors lacked sufficient resources to conduct the required background checks for contractors seeking day passes instead of paying to take part in the NCACS, it said. ""As a result, 52 convicted felons received routine, unauthorized access to Navy installations for 62 to 1,035 days,"" the audit said, adding that ""this placed military personnel, dependents, civilians, and installations at an increased security risk."" Vetting military contractors: How did the Navy Yard gunman get in? Felony crimes by those who received improper access included intent to distribute cocaine, assault, theft and throwing a missile at an occupied vehicle, according to the audit. It also challenged the contention by Navy officials that the Rapidgate program amounted to a money saving move because of the fees paid by contractors for credentials. ""The cost reportedly absorbed by contractors to obtain Rapidgate credentials are transferred back to the Navy in the form of higher contract overhead costs and other contract fees,"" the audit said, adding that the lack of transparent accounting meant that the Navy ""is unable to account for actual NCACS-related charges from contractor companies."" For example, it said, the Navy incurred NCACS-related charges of at least $1.28 million for 17 of the more than 30,000 contractor companies enrolled in the program. In a statement Wednesday, Eid Passport CEO Steve Larson said the company welcomed audits and ""looks forward to working with the Department of Defense to further refine and advance the world's best high-assurance identity management solution."" The statement contained no direct response to specific findings of the audit. What is security like at the Navy Yard? Hagel ordered a worldwide review of physical security measures at all U.S. military installations following Monday's shooting. The Pentagon also is expected to review security clearances and access standards for contractors and other employees, according to a Defense Department official. At the White House on Tuesday, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the Director of National Intelligence ""is currently undertaking a review of the security clearance policy for certain contractors."" In addition, he said, President Barack Obama directed the Office of Management and Budget was ""examining standards for contractors and employees across federal agencies.""

"(CNN) -- Could the captured Sinaloa cartel boss who was one of Mexico's most wanted fugitives be heading to the United States for trial? He will, if U.S. federal prosecutors have anything to say about it. Bob Nardoza, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, said Sunday that American authorities plan to seek the extradition of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Authorities captured the notorious drug lord Saturday in the Mexican Pacific resort city of Mazatlan. Cases are pending against him in New York and several other United States jurisdictions, and it's not clear which requests would take priority. But just because the United States wants to extradite him doesn't mean Guzman will be heading north of the border any time soon. ""Mexico is going to want to prosecute him. They're going to want the first shot at him,"" CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said Sunday. ""The extradition to the U.S. could happen at a later date, but I doubt it. I think that the Mexicans are going to want him, and they're going to want to keep him in prison down there."" Guzman escaped from a high-security Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly hiding in a laundry basket. Throughout the years, he avoided being caught because of his enormous power to bribe corrupt local, state and federal Mexican officials. His nickname, which means ""Shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame. From New York to Chicago, Texas to San Diego, Guzman and his lieutenants are named in indictments for marijuana, cocaine and heroin trafficking, as well as racketeering, money laundering, kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder. In Chicago, the city's crime commission named Guzman its Public Enemy No. 1 last year. But more than anywhere else, Fuentes said, the ""Public Enemy No. 1"" designation is true for Guzman in Mexico. ""He's responsible for the deaths of thousands of people. He's considered one of the richest men in the world, and the Sinaloa cartel...is considered the most prolific drug-trafficking organization in the world,"" said Fuentes, former assistant director of the FBI's Office of International Operations. When Guzman escaped from prison, he had served seven years of a 20-year, nine-month sentence. Mexico's attorney general's office said there were eight warrants for Guzman's arrest there -- two tied to his 2001 escape, and six more for alleged crimes committed since then. Authorities said they were taking him to the Altiplano prison outside Mexico City on Saturday, where he was set to be interrogated. No attorney had yet come forward representing the cartel boss, officials said, and no extradition request had been made. Eduardo Medina Mora, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, told The New York Times that authorities from the United States and Mexico had been working together on the case for months, but hadn't worked out whether Guzman would be extradited. ""I think it's important that first he faces the charges against him in Mexico,"" Medina Mora told the newspaper. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Mexican officials should consider extradition now. ""The normal sequence is, Mexico being a sovereign nation, (it) has the first prosecution. However, there's a history here. He escaped from a prison in 2001. There is corruption in that country. And I would ask that the Mexicans consider extraditing him to the United States, where he will be put into a 'supermax' prison under tight security, where he cannot escape, and be brought to justice with a life sentence,"" McCaul told ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think that would be the best course of action for not only Mexico, but also the United States, in ensuring that what happened in 2001 does not happen again."" How likely extradition is, the Texas Republican congressman said, depends on how much pressure the State Department puts on Mexico's government. But he said it would be worth the effort. ""The track record's not good with this individual,"" he said. ""This is an exceptional case. This is the largest, biggest drug lord we've ever seen in the world."" Phil Jordan, who spent three decades with the DEA and headed the agency's El Paso Intelligence Center, said extraditing Guzman is the only way to truly cripple his organization. ""It is a significant arrest, provided he gets extradited immediately to the United States,"" Jordan told CNN Saturday. ""If he does not get extradited, then he will be allowed to escape within a period of time. ... If he is, in fact, incarcerated, until he gets extradited to the United States, it will be business as usual.""

"(CNN) -- It was destroyed 2,000 years ago, but now Italy's ancient Roman city of Pompeii is facing ruin once again. Not by a volcanic eruption like the one that buried the city in 79 AD, but by years of ""neglect"" and ""mediocre"" management by the Italian government, according to heritage groups and archaeologists. The UNESCO World Heritage site came under scrutiny in early November, when one of its archaeological treasures, the ""House of the Gladiators,"" crumbled.  Since then, the walls of four more buildings have been reduced to rubble because their ancient mortar is unable to cope with recent heavy rainfall, says Soprintendenza archeologica di Pompei, the organization charged with the site's upkeep. Pompeii, near Naples in the south of Italy, is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in the country. It was destroyed when a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius buried the city in ash. The ash preserved the remains to an astonishing degree, which is why Pompeii is such a treasure. The site receives more than 2.5 million visitors each year, and according to Antonio Varone, director of excavations at the site, it generated $23.8 million from tourists in the first 10 months of this year alone. So why is one of the world's most treasured and historically significant sites in such a lamentable state? ""The current state of conservation in Pompeii is mediocre,"" said Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, former Superintendent and archeologist at Pompeii. Guzzo retired in August 2009 after 15 years in the post. ""The financial resources available for restoration and conservation have always been negligible,"" he said. ""Instead it is preferred to dig, rather than preserve what has already been discovered."" According to Guzzo, remains would be safer left buried. Inadequate funds are not enough to protect all of the site's fragile ruins -- most of them are held together by ancient mortar so delicate ""even the rain does damage."" In fact, says Guzzo, Pompeii is so starved of funding that the Soprintendenza don't even have enough cars and gasoline to travel around inspecting the various sites.  Despite the Soprintendenza collecting revenue from ticket sales and receiving funds from the government, Guzzo says its not enough to make up the estimated €260 million ($343 million) needed to restore the site completely. ""You also have to note that the Soprintendenza of Pompeii is also responsible for the archeological sites of Herculaneum, Stabia, Oplontis (and) Boscoreale, which also need to be maintained,"" Guzzo added. So desperate is the situation, Italy's oldest heritage charity, Italia Nostra, has issued a red list consisting of over 50 sites in need of urgent attention. ""There has been no maintenance for decades,"" said Alessandra Mottola Molfino, President of Italia Nostra. ""We have 47 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It's an enormous responsibility, but one not taken seriously."" Mottola Molfino places the blame squarely at the feet of the Italian government . The problem, she says, is twofold -- a dramatic reduction in the Ministry of Culture's budget and a siphoning of funds within the Ministry towards showy events at the expense of conservation. According to the research group l'Associazione per l'Economia della Cultura, allocated spending for Ministry of Culture departments in charge of conservation was halved over eight years from 2000 to 2008, though there is evidence of investment in other departments. Mottola Molfino thinks that Culture Minister Sandro Bondi's department is also funnelling cash in the wrong direction. ""The ministry has spent enormous quantities of money on ephemeral events,"" she said. ""In Pompeii, they've spent money on theatre and shows, not on the maintenance of the area."" Guzzo agreed, saying the promotion of events at Pompeii, such as the anniversary of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, had taken priority over the ""silent and daily"" work of conservation. CNN put these allegations to the Ministry of Culture and was still waiting for a response at the time of publication. However, five days after the collapse of the House of the Gladiators the President of the Chamber of Deputies Commission for Culture, Valentina Aprea denied allegations of neglect by the government and defended Culture Minister Bondi.  ""The exceptional nature of the site of Pompeii has never been neglected by an Italian government and in particular by Minister Bondi,"" who's management of the site, she said in a news release, has been extraordinary. Since the House of the Gladiators collapsed, the ministry has put in place emergency measures at Pompeii, giving the Soprintendenza stronger powers to protect the site, as well drawing up plans to increase the number of archaeologists and skilled workers on site, according to a statement on the ministry website. For Mottola Molfino the measures can't come soon enough. ""We have the means to do it. We have enough knowledge and enough money -- why should we not care for our best assets?""","Ancient Pompeii has come under scrutiny after the collapse of the House of the Gladiators .

"(CNN) -- Syrian forces are uprooting thousands of people and then demolishing their homes in part of a flashpoint city that has been the center of an anti-government rebellion, according to residents there. Tanks and bulldozers have been tearing down houses in the Mesha Alarbeen district of the city of Hama, the site of intense fighting during an uprising against the Syrian government. The displacement and demolition has conjured fears of something that happened in the western city 30 years ago. The Hama Massacre of 1982 is fresh in the minds of Syrians. Acting under orders from Hafez Assad -- the father of the current Syrian president -- the Syrian military brutally suppressed a revolt in Hama. Estimates of the number of casualties vary from 3,000 to 40,000. A 1983 Amnesty International report put the death toll on both sides as between 10,000 and 25,000. Read more: Syrian children's horror stories released . Once again, Hama is a stronghold of anti-government activists who have roiled the country for the past 18 months. Security forces rolled in with tanks and bulldozers. ""So far they have razed 120 buildings,"" Osamah, a Hama resident who visited the neighborhood on Sunday, told CNN. The neighborhood had been ""the main gathering place"" for those ""peaceful and militant"" who oppose President Bashar al-Assad's government, according to Osamah. That is until last June, when the security forces decided to enter the district and completely take it over, several activists said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported a ""massive presence of terrorist armed gangs that threaten"" the people of Hama. Other SANA articles referenced how security forces had found large amounts of weapons in the area. Read more: Fresh attacks, but few answers in Syria . The government has consistently referred to anti-government forces as terrorists. ""The security forces started using artillery fire to shell several positions in the neighborhood,"" Abdallah -- another resident -- told CNN from Meshaa Alarbaeen. ""Some of the poorest people live here. The security forces targeted their homes indiscriminately. They really tried to make life impossible for the residents."" Read more: Syria explained: What you need to know . A few weeks ago, security forces allowed the bulldozers to enter the district. Several amateur videos purportedly shot over the past two weeks support the activists' claims. They show bulldozers flattening entire blocks while operating under the watchful eyes of security forces. Eyewitnesses said security force members have been going building-to-building asking people to evacuate their homes. ""Most of the residents have left their homes.

"(CNN) -- Call it ""big snotty."" It is a giant 5-foot diameter new species of jellyfish that slimed a beach in Australia last month, much to the delight of Lisa-ann Gershwin, a scientist at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. ""I'm just rapt by it, honestly. It's such an amazing find,"" Gershwin told the Sydney Morning Herald. The creature was found on the southern Australian island of Tasmania by a family collecting shells, according to news reports. ""We were at the beach looking for shells and dad was like 'Whoa! Look at that'...I kind of touched it.. it was pretty cool,"" said Xavier Lim, 12, according to a report from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Gershwin said the milky white creatures with pink in the middle have not been classified by science, but they've been spotted before. Recently, however, they've been turning up more in the waters off Tasmania. ""All of a sudden I started getting all these calls, and all these people sending me photographs. Sure enough this thing is an absolute menace this season; it's been around in large numbers,"" Gershwin told the Herald. They are not deadly to humans though. ""If you touched it or whacked into when you were swimming it is very painful,"" Australian Broadcasting quoted her as saying. ""It's not life-threatening, but it will sting you, it will wake you up."" Gershwin said she got hold of some other, smaller specimens of the creature before Christmas. ""I've been ... working with jellyfish for a long time here and I've seen a lot of big jellyfish but this one's really big,"" ABC quoted her as saying. And they are prolific, she said. ""We don't actually know what's going on that's led, not only to this species, but many, many types of jellyfish blooming in massive numbers,"" she told the Herald. ""Jellyfish do bloom as a normal part of their life cycle, but not usually this many."" She told the Herald she has been working to get a scientific name approved for the new jellyfish, which she believes is related to previously identified jellyfish in the area called lion's mane, and sometimes ""snotties.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber could learn from former teen stars Chris Brown and Lindsay Lohan how not to turn 20. Lohan and Brown are still dealing in their mid-20s with the consequences of their bad actions at that age. Bieber's 20th birthday is March 1. HIs last weeks as a 19-year-old have been punctuated with two arrests and a third criminal investigation that could result in a felony charge. The ""Baby"" singer faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license after a traffic stop in Miami Beach, Florida, and an assault charge for allegedly hitting his limousine driver in Toronto. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering a vandalism charge against him, pending a sheriff's investigation into an egg attack on a neighbor's home. A good lawyer -- and Bieber has plenty of those -- might resolve those cases without taking his freedom. Lohan, whose offenses included two drunken driving convictions, and Brown, who pleaded guilty to beating girlfriend Rihanna, got probation, community labor and court-ordered counseling. Probation gone bad . A lesson for Bieber might be that even if those first crimes don't bring jail time, breaking probation rules can get you locked up. The best lawyer can only help a client to a point, especially if that client fails to report to a probation officer, doesn't complete community service, tests positive for illegal drugs or gets arrested again. Ask Lohan or Brown. Their entertainment careers have been stunted since their 20th birthdays by repeated probation violations that led to stints in rehab, months of additional community labor, frequent trips to court and occasional days behind bars. Lohan's lesson for Bieber . Lohan did well posing for Playboy between court appearances, but her once-promising film career has been derailed by producers wary about her reliability. Red carpet walks at movie premieres were replaced by dozens of walks into a courthouse. Film critics can pan your work, but a judge can throw you in jail. Her probation was going well for the first two years, before a prosecutor questioned if she was attending court-ordered counseling sessions. She was late for a probation hearing once, then completely missed another court date. Lohan was convicted of shoplifting a necklace. She angered a series of judges, resulting in dozens of court dates, several probation revocations, jail and rehab visits. Lohan, who has publicly acknowledged her substance abuse struggle, appears to have finally found some balance in her life since completing treatment at the Cliffside Malibu rehab facility last year. She is still on probation. Brown's lesson for Bieber . Chris Brown got glowing probation reports the first two years after he pleaded guilty to felony assault in August 2009. But Los Angeles prosecutors began looking closer at his behavior after reports of a bar fight with Drake, a parking lot brawl with Frank Ocean and a hit-and-run arrest. Investigators found evidence that Brown had fudged on completing the community labor requirement. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program in late October, days after he was arrested on an assault charge in Washington. His treatment ended abruptly when he was kicked out of the rehab program for throwing a rock through his mother's car window in the middle of a family counseling session, according to a probation report. The judge soon revoked Brown's probation, but sent him back to rehab for 90 days instead of jail. Brown is now in a ""dual diagnosis"" rehab program for help with anger management and substance abuse. The latest probation report said he ""is doing well in the program and making great strides"" in rehab, although the prosecutor asked the judge to send him to jail because his violent outbursts were ""increasing in severity and intensity."" The Washington assault charge is still pending. Travel restrictions . Brown has managed to put out new music and tour while on probation, but his legal troubles have dampened his success. When he wanted to tour Europe, he couldn't. British border officials cited concerns that Brown might pose a danger to British citizens when they barred him from entering the United Kingdom for concerts in 2010. ""We reserve the right to refuse entry to the UK to anyone guilty of a serious criminal offense,"" said Barbara Woodward, director of the UK Border Agency's international group. ""Public safety is one of our primary concerns."" A criminal record could threaten Bieber's career even more, because he is a Canadian citizen living and working in the United States on a visa. While convictions might not result in his deportation, they could make crossing the border a problem. Bieber, who has built a fortune by touring the world, has already gotten a taste of what could be. U.S. Customs agents delayed his entry into the United States for several hours after his chartered jet landed in New Jersey's Teterboro Airport from Toronto last week. Agents interviewed him for several hours before clearing him for entry. Drug-sniffing dogs were used to search his plane, but no sign of drugs was detected and no illegal substances were found, according to a law enforcement source. A government statement to CNN noted that there are ""more than 60 grounds of inadmissibility divided into several major categories, including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds"" that could keep someone out of the country. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said the evidence that Bieber had Xanax in his blood when he was arrested in Florida could be viewed as ""drug abuse"" by U.S. border officials, if he did not have a prescription for the controlled substance. The threats to Justin Bieber's freedom and career are still only allegations. He has not been convicted of anything. If he is eventually found guilty and placed on probation, he has the advantage of knowing from his friends Chris and Lindsay how important it is to play by the rules.","Justin Bieber, who turns 20 on March 1, faces criminal charges .

"(CNN) -- A radical Islamist group has claimed responsibility for the murder of Swedish journalist Nils Horner. The Fidai Mahaz group said on its website Tuesday that it had ""targeted"" the correspondent on the Wasir Akbar Khan 15 Road in Kabul. The brief statement, attributed to the group's spokesperson Qari Hamza, asserted that the slain man was a spy and ""special worker"" of British intelligence agency MI6. Neither the statement, nor any other part of the group's website, offered any proof that the splinter group was behind the killing, and officials have cast doubts on the veracity of the claim. ""It is an ongoing investigation,"" Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, told CNN. ""The Afghan police force are working very hard to find out who really was behind this. ""We cannot verify any claim by anyone or any group at this stage."" Previous statements posted on the site claim attacks on American and other NATO troops, and on Afghan security forces. The group also said it was responsibility -- under a previous name -- for the assassination of Canadian permanent resident Arsala Jamal, who was the governor of the Afghanistan's Logar Province. The group's leader, Mullah Najibullah, also known by his nom de guerre Umar Khatab, is at odds with the Taliban leadership and has openly called them ""traitors."" His faction is opposed to the Taliban's attempts at detente. Qari Yusuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, told CNN that he had no idea who the group was, and said that the Taliban had no relationship with it. A dual British and Swedish national, Horner worked as a reporter for Sweden's Sveriges Radio, mostly covering Asia and the Middle East. The 51-year-old recently moved to Hong Kong and had visited Afghanistan several times previously. He was gunned down in broad daylight on a Kabul street Tuesday. A Lebanese restaurant near the site of the shooting was attacked in January. The brazen killing comes at a time when Afghanistan is preparing for next month's presidential elections, and ahead of NATO's planned withdrawal of troops by the end of 2014.

"(CNN) -- At least 20 police officers were feared killed Tuesday in a Maoist raid in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, authorities said. ""Unconfirmed sources tell us 20 policemen have lost their lives,"" said Arun Dev Gautam, the state police inspector general. The morning attack targeted a police security team of about 40 personnel in Sukma district, he said. Gautam didn't rule out the use of landmines in the assault believed to involve 200 rebel fighters. The Maoists ambushed the police team, which included state and armed federal personnel, as it provided security to construction workers, he said. At a police conference in New Delhi in November, India's home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde described the rebels as a ""major threat"" to national security. At least 97 security personnel and as many guerrillas were killed in Maoist assaults last year, he said. The rebels, officials say, aim to seize power through an armed liberation struggle. Since the 1960s, the militants have said they are fighting for the dispossessed. Authorities suspect that Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities, but also among youth and intellectuals. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call ""class enemies,"" the insurgents also attack infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.

A ministry official said the flights are standard operating procedure for air force training. One of them twice flew about 2,000 feet over the deck of the USS Nimitz Saturday while another flew about 50 miles away, officials said.

"Remember when vitamin C was hailed as the best, and maybe only, cold remedy? Then it became the Rodney Dangerfield of vitamins: It didn't get any respect. Citrus and other sources of Vitamin C can help fend off cancer, strokes and Alzheimer's disease. The nutrient's glory days of curing scurvy-riddled sailors via juicy citrus fruit seemed to be the only thing keeping its reputation afloat, particularly after a massive research review found C to be virtually useless for fighting colds. But don't believe it. The truth is that scientists have taken a fresh look at C -- and have found lots of new ways it can help you stay healthy and look and feel younger. Here's the latest on what C can really do for you. Prevent wrinkles . You can't pick up a beauty product these days without the label touting its antioxidants. There's a good reason: Antioxidants -- like vitamin C -- help turn back the clock. An October 2007 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who ate foods rich in vitamin C had fewer wrinkles and less age-related dry skin than those whose diets contained only small amounts of the vitamin. C helps form collagen, which smooths fine lines and wrinkles, according to Patricia Farris, MD, clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Tulane University in New Orleans. The key seems to be C's ability to fight free radicals, a by-product of cell metabolism in your body. Free radicals are thought to attack proteins, fats, and DNA and break down collagen. C also seems to guard against ultraviolet rays from the sun, which can lead to freckles and a mottled complexion. ""Vitamin C does some repair and firming on the skin,"" Farris says. Health.com: Can you guess her age? What to do now: Use a topical vitamin C treatment daily after you wash your face and before you slather on moisturizer or sunscreen so it penetrates the skin. Farris recommends La Roche-Posay Active C facial moisturizer or SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic topical antioxidant treatment. Protect your heart . Experts continue to argue about whether antioxidants like vitamin C can prevent heart disease. But some of the evidence is highly persuasive. When Finnish researchers looked at studies involving nearly 300,000 people over 10 years, they found that taking more than 700 milligrams of C supplements daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 25 percent. And a recent study from Harvard University researchers hints that women who take a combo of 500 milligrams of vitamin C daily and 600 IU of vitamin E (another antioxidant) can cut their risk of stroke by 30 percent. It's possible that people who take vitamin supplements simply have healthier lifestyles than those who don't, which could explain this finding. It's also possible, experts say, that C enhances the functioning of endothelial cells (which line the inside of all blood vessels), slowing artery clogging and lowering blood pressure. What to do now: Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, which are full of vitamin C as well as other healthy nutrients, and consider taking C and E supplements. Experts say there are essentially no risks, but first check with your doctor. Health.com: Get your C's here . Keep cancer at bay . A diet full of vitamin C--rich fruits and vegetables isn't just good for your heart, it may also lower your risks of bladder, esophagus, stomach, and lung cancers. Even though more research is needed to find out which compounds in fruits and veggies do the trick, researchers say the association is strong. Someday, C may also be used to treat cancer. High levels of C given intravenously seem to be toxic to cancer cells (studies on vitamin C taken orally showed no effect on cancerous cells). Intravenous C appears to trigger the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which kills some cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed, says lead study author Mark Levine, MD, chief of the molecular and clinical nutrition section and senior staff physician at the National Institutes of Health. Levine says doctors at the University of Kansas Medical School and Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia are trying this therapy on cancer patients. What to do now: ""Strive for five or more fruits and vegetables daily, in a rainbow of colors,"" Levine says. ""It's where the most benefit is. Health.com: CAn C fight off a cold? Boost brain power . Pairing vitamins C and E is smart for another reason: It may lessen your Alzheimer's risks by as much as 64 percent, according to research in the Archives of Neurology. Just 500 milligrams of C and 400 IU of E appear to be enough. The brain's high fat content makes it especially vulnerable to free radicals, but these antioxidants may act as shields, says study author Peter Zandi, PhD, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Some studies suggest that vitamin E does its job reducing free radicals in the body, but then its capacity is depleted,"" Zandi says. ""Vitamin C may recharge E.""  Health.com: The best multivitamin for you . What to do now: Try taking C and E supplements, and talk to your doc about your risks for Alzheimer's and dementia. Save your eyesight . Vitamin C can't prevent the need for reading glasses around age 45. But anti-oxidants, including C, help prevent one of the leading causes of blindness: age-related macular degeneration (AMD). More than 3.5 million Americans are thought to be in the early stages, and the disease strikes more women than men. A major clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute showed that a daily supplement of 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, 15 milligrams of beta-carotene, 80 milligrams of zinc, and 2 milligrams of copper reduced the risk of moderate or severe AMD-related vision loss by up to 25 percent. The antioxidants neutralize damage to the retina caused by, you guessed it, free radicals. What to do now: If you're at high risk for AMD (you're overweight or have a family history), check to see if your multi-vitamin contains the study's amounts of C, E, beta-carotene/vitamin A, zinc, and copper. Chances are, its C and E levels fall short, but additional supplements will do the job. (Caveat: Don't follow this advice if you smoke; this level of beta-carotene may up your lung-cancer risks.) Help you live longer . You've probably heard that green tea boosts the body's defenses against toxins. That's important because toxins are thought to contribute to cancer, heart attack, stroke, and lots of other maladies. In fact, one to two cups a day may reduce a woman's risk of dying by about 20 per-cent, Japanese researchers say. What's the vitamin C connection? Citrus juices (lemon, lime, orange) may supercharge the immunity-boosting power of green tea. A new Purdue University study found that mixing citrus juice with green tea allowed 80 percent of the tea's anti-oxidants to stick around after simulated digestion, making the pairing healthier than thought, says study author Mario G. Ferruzzi, PhD, assistant professor in Purdue's department of food and nutrition. What to do now: Add at least an ounce of citrus juice to your green tea -- or try Tazo Lemon Green iced tea or SoBe Green Tea 3G. Both drinks are stocked with vitamin C. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Alaskan authorities say there's no evidence to back up a 19-year-old Pennsylvania woman's claim that one of the countless killings she carried out was in their state. Miranda Barbour told a newspaper reporter over the weekend that she killed so many people across so many states in the last six years that she lost count. She told the Daily Item newspaper in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, that the killings spanned from Alaska to North Carolina. However, Alaska State Troopers said Tuesday Barbour's claims don't bear out -- at least in their state. ""At this time the Alaska State Troopers are not aware of any information -- beyond Barbour's comments quoted in the press -- or evidence that would implicate Barbour with a homicide committed in Alaska,"" a statement from the agency said. The agency said it has been in contact with Pennsylvania authorities. ""We will follow up on any credible lead that is provided to us,"" the statement said. Claims invite skepticism . Barbour told the newspaper that she began killing when she was 13. She took credit for more than 22 but fewer than 100 killings, Daily Item reporter Francis Scarcella told CNN affiliate WNEP. Authorities haven't verified her claims, although they are investigating. Many are skeptical. Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who police say the couple lured with a Craigslist ad, strangled, repeatedly stabbed and dumped in a yard. If her other claims are true, Barbour would be one of the nation's most prolific serial killers. Gary Ridgway, known as the Green River Killer, pleaded guilty to killing 49 women in Washington state in the 1980s and 1990s. Randy Steven Kraft may have killed as many as 65 young men in the 1970s and early 1980s. Based on the numbers she gave Scarcella, Barbour would have had to kill on average somewhere between every three weeks and every three months. For six years. Without leaving a trace. Yet in the 2013 killing, police documents show Barbour told police she and her husband couldn't clean up all the blood LaFerrara's killing left in her CR-V, and that one of the ways investigators traced the killing to her was her own cell phone. The last number dialed on LaFerrara's phone led to Barbour, according to police. Even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple, Northumberland County District Attorney Tony Rosini, said he discounts Barbour's other claims. ""As of this date, there has been no verification of any of the information that has been subject of media coverage regarding prior acts of the defendant, Miranda Barbour,"" Rosini said in a statement. ""Any information regarding crimes committed in other jurisdictions has been or will be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the FBI for further investigation,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- American voters under 40 share a simple reality -- for most of their lives, a Bush or Clinton has been President. The 20-year streak began with Republican George H.W. Bush's inauguration in January 1989 and ran through two terms for Democrat Bill Clinton and then two for Bush's son, George W., until Barack Obama took office in January 2009. Now the latest polling indicates the next presidential election in 2016 may again offer familiar choices. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday showed Hillary Clinton -- the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state -- way ahead of any other potential Democratic challenger, with Jeb Bush -- the former two-term Florida governor who is son of one president and brother of another -- among the top Republicans. No one can say for sure if either will even run, and anything can happen in the more than two years before either would actually get nominated. Poll: If not Clinton, then what kind of Democrat? But if such a race happens, it would mean that at the end of the winner's first term in 2020, either a Clinton or a Bush would have occupied the Oval Office for 24 of the previous 32 years. Even Barbara Bush, Jeb's mom, thinks that's too much. She told C-SPAN last month that ""if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office, that's silly."" Family spokesman: Barbara wasn't telling Jeb not to run . Both candidates boast strong pedigrees due to their names and experience. The question is whether their political lineage will be a boon or a burden two years from now. The early thinking is that Clinton's historic goal to be the first woman President better immunizes her from what analysts call possible name fatigue among voters. ""It is a good bet that women would propel Hillary forward, while Jeb Bush would be left behind,"" said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. ""Both Clinton and Bush would be saddled with last names that incite mixed emotions among current voters, but she has a natural demographic constituency that he lacks."" In particular, ""women vote in greater numbers than men and there is an 11% gender gap in favor of Democrats, which means that even Clinton fatigue can be overcome in a presidential election,"" Schiller added. Hillary Clinton's understudy waits in the wings . A Jeb Bush candidacy would make its own history, noted CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""There have been plenty of presidential candidates whose fathers also ran for President, and a few whose brothers have been candidates,"" Holland said. ""But if Jeb Bush throws his hat in the ring, he will be the first candidate in history who fits into both categories. Does that help because the Bush 'brand name' is well known, or hurt because Jeb would be judged by the public based on things he did not do himself? Historically speaking, there is no way to tell."" Jeb Bush on 2016 decision: 'Can I do it joyfully?' He said one difference between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush involves final impressions of their familial White House predecessors. ""Clinton's husband was fairly popular in his last year or so in office and that wasn't true for Bush's brother or his father,"" Holland said. Incumbent George H.W. Bush got thumped by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election, due to breaking a pledge against new taxes as well as the third party candidacy of Ross Perot who got 19% of the vote to presumably siphon off GOP support. George W. Bush had an approval rating in the mid-30s when his second term ended amid two wars and a recession. After generally refusing to acknowledge any interest in a White House run, Jeb Bush last week suddenly said he would think about it. ""I'm deferring the decision to the right time, which is later this year,"" he said. ""And the decision will be based on can I do it joyfully, because I think we need to have candidates lift our spirits."" ""Something switched in Jeb,"" noted CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, pointing out that instead of distancing himself from the question, Bush now offered a timetable for a decision and a thematic basis that ""you have to be joyful, you have to get uplifted, you've got to be optimistic."" His shift in stance coincided with political woes facing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the early Republican favorite now facing multiple investigations over suggestions officials in his administration abused their power. Frum: GOP race for 2016 is wide open . The CNN/ORC poll showed a pack of potential GOP contenders in a statistical dead heat so early in the process, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Bush and Christie, closely trailed by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the GOP vice-presidential nominee in 2012. As recently as November, Christie had an 11-percentage-point lead. CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said Bush likely feared name fatigue when he decided against mounting a presidential bid in 2012. ""So the question is, if you skip ahead, four more years, will there still be Bush fatigue?"" Borger wondered, adding: ""We just don't know."" To Schiller, a Bush campaign would bring calls by his GOP rivals for fresh blood. ""You can bet that within the Republican Party, every other remotely viable candidate, from Paul Ryan to Rand Paul to Ted Cruz and maybe still Chris Christie will adopt a campaign slogan that calls for new leadership, and a brand new last name in the White House,"" she said. Ryan: 'Not closing my options' on 2016 . Clinton, meanwhile, has her own political baggage that GOP strategists will attempt to exploit fully, including her husband's affair with a White House intern while in office and the September 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans on her watch as secretary of state. Clinton spokesman says tweet was '100% humor' Hillary tweets viral Super Bowl joke, right blitzes back . Conservatives relentlessly attack her over the lack of sufficient security in Benghazi as well as the failure to respond in time to save American lives. They also accuse the Obama administration of trying to deceive the American public by first blaming the attack on a spontaneous protest instead of a full-fledged terrorist assault. Clinton's biggest regret at State: Benghazi . Senators: Benghazi attack 'likely preventable' Obama faced tough grilling on the matter before Sunday's Super Bowl in a live interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, with the President eventually saying that some people believe what he called the false notion of a politically inspired cover-up ""because folks like you are telling them that."" According to the CNN/ORC poll, 62% of respondents approve of the job Clinton did at the State Department, down 4 percentage points from December 2012 -- a month before she stepped down as America's top diplomat. ""If the election were held in 2014, I think both Clinton and Bush would suffer from name fatigue stemming from an overall high level of dissatisfaction with government and all who have been part of it,"" Schiller said, citing a recent Gallup poll that found 65% of respondents dissatisfied with how well the government works. ""It is not a malaise,"" Schiller added, calling it ""a more energetic level of discontent, and anyone viewed as establishment on the left or the right is vulnerable to it.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A Chinese passenger jet with more than 200 people on board flew through the trajectory of a North Korean rocket that had been fired minutes earlier, the South Korean government said. North Korea fired the rocket Tuesday at 4:17 p.m. without giving any navigational warning, Kim Min-Seok, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said Wednesday. Seven minutes later, a China Southern Airlines plane carrying 220 passengers from Japan's Narita airport to Shenyang in China passed through the rocket's trajectory, he said. ""It was a very dangerous situation,"" Kim said during a news briefing. ""North Korea's provocative actions violate the international navigation laws and pose a great threat to the safety of civilians."" South Korea has informed Chinese authorities about what happened, the Defense Ministry said. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said Thursday that the plane flew through North Korean airspace ""normally on that day without incident."" ""When relevant countries conduct military training or exercises, they should abide by international custom to take measures that would ensure the safety of civil aircraft or ships passing through their airspace or territorial water,"" Qin said. He said that China attaches a great deal of importance to the safety of its civil aircraft and would ""seek verification from relevant parties and express necessary concern from our side."" Officials from China Southern Airlines didn't respond to calls seeking comment Thursday. The rocket in question was one of seven fired Tuesday by North Korea into the sea off its east coast, according to South Korean authorities. Given the speeds the plane and rocket were traveling at, the seven-minute gap means there was still ""quite a big distance"" between them, said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at Flightglobal, an aviation and aerospace website. ""Although the chances of hitting the aircraft were extremely low, akin to hitting a bullet with a bullet, there is absolutely no need to endanger civilians, however remote the danger may be,"" he said. North Korea missile capabilities . North Korea defends launches . North Korea on Wednesday defended the series of short-range missile and rocket launches it has carried out in recent weeks. ""It is justifiable self-defense behavior for us to conduct these military exercises in order to preserve peace in the region and to protect the safety of our people and our country,"" the North's Korean People's Army said in a statement carried by state media. The military's statement didn't make any mention of South Korea's comments about the Chinese plane, but it said its recent launches hadn't affected ""international navigational order."" The North's launches have taken place as U.S. and South Korean troops conduct annual military exercises in the region. The large-scale drills anger North Korea, which says it views them as a rehearsal for an invasion. The North has fired missiles or rockets into the sea on several occasions between February 21 and Tuesday, according to the South Korean government. Seoul says some of the ballistic missiles are Scud class with a long enough range to cover the entire Korean Peninsula. North Korea on Wednesday acknowledged that it had conducted ""rocket launch training"" over that period. North Korea shows off South Korean man it's holding on spy charges . Who's provoking whom? South Korea has said the launches -- short-range and aimed in a northeasterly direction out to sea -- are intentional provocations. The U.S. State Department said Monday that launches of the Scuds violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. ""We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions, and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Those comments appeared to have irritated North Korea's military. ""The U.S. and its supporters are calling our actions provocation, but they should not talk about provocation when they don't know what provocation is,"" the North's military statement said. ""Provocation is when somebody has intent to hurt somebody else, but what we are doing is to protect ourselves, our country, our land, our people."" The U.S.-South Korean military exercises, on the other hand, are provocative, North Korea said: ""It's a reckless American way of provocation and they're doing all this on somebody else's land."" It threatened the possibility of the launch of a more powerful rocket. Pyongyang had previously called for the cancellation of the joint exercises, a request dismissed by Washington and Seoul. North Korea launches missiles into sea . Calmer than last year . The North's verbal attack Wednesday didn't reach the ominous levels of its saber rattling this time last year, which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea. ""Unannounced missile tests are not a good thing, but their political and military significance depends on context,"" Stephan Haggard, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. North Korea conducted or threatened test launches during a similar period last year, soon after it had drawn international condemnation for launching a long-range rocket and carrying out its third nuclear test. ""This year, the political setting is less confrontational,"" wrote Haggard, who is also a professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at the University of California, San Diego. Despite the current military drills, ties between North and South Korea have improved slightly in recent months. Over several days last month, the two countries held reunions of families separated for decades by the Korean War -- the first such meetings since 2010. South Korea on Wednesday said it was proposing new talks between the two sides next week to discuss the possibility of further reunions. But North Korea rejected the proposal, the South Korean Unification Ministry said Thursday. Compared with last year, North Korea is being ""remarkably quiet,"" said Andrei Lankov, a professor of history at Kookmin University in Seoul. ""They had to do something because it would be politically impossible to do nothing during the joint exercises, especially after they made so much noise about it,"" Lankov said. ""But they act with remarkable restraint."" Report: North Korea fires two missiles off eastern coast . CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

"(CNN) -- Killing a 500-plus pound boar might sound like a big deal. But for one North Carolina man, it is just how he brings home the bacon. Jett Webb killed the massive animal last month in eastern North Carolina. When the amazing pictures of the animal and hunter recently circulated on the Internet, Webb started fielding calls from the media. Webb told CNN on Thursday that while many people were astonished by the kill, he shot a boar of a similar size two years ago. Still, friends and family were in awe. ""They were blown away. It's not every day you see something that size,"" Webb said. ""They can't believe something that big is running around the woods of eastern North Carolina."" Webb, a firefighter in Conetoe, said the gigantic pig provided so much meat that it filled up his deep freezer. He gave a lot of meat away, but still has ""a lot to last me a while."" Webb, 34, said hunting isn't about bagging trophies for him. He has been hunting since he was 12 years old and says it relaxes him and provides food for his family. ""The meat the pig provided and the memory that hunting provides is worth more than any trophy,"" he said. Webb and a few other of his fellow hunters at the White Oak Ranch Hunting Club had been tracking the massive hog since January on surveillance cameras they have placed throughout their hunting grounds. They just didn't realize how big a pig this was. On February 28, Webb had been in a tree stand in Bertie County for hours when he spotted the boar and took him down with one shot. Webb said he used an AR-10 with a .308-caliber round. He and a buddy tried to drag the hog out of the woods. That lasted a few feet. They had to go get a four-wheeler to drag it out. The scale only went to 500 pounds. It topped out, but Webb said he didn't think the boar weighed much more than 500 pounds. Michael Mansell, president of the hunting club, told North Carolina Sportsman magazine that he was there when the giant porker was weighed. Wild boar are not native to the United States -- they may have come with Christopher Columbus -- and didn't appear in North Carolina until 1912, the state's Department of Wildlife website says. Their average size is less than 180 pounds, the site says. In North Carolina, wild boar may be hunted year round during normal hunting hours. There is no closed season and no bag limit. In 2004, a hunter in Georgia killed an 800-pound boar dubbed Hogzilla.","Jett Webb plans to eat what he doesn't give away .

But theirs wasn't to be the kind of romance that Bollywood endings are made of. Their marriage soon soured. And Bunty Sharma stabbed his wife, Erin Willinger, to death before blowing himself up in his home. Willinger, 35, of Pennsylvania first visited the northern Indian city of Agra in September to see the Taj Mahal, the white marble mausoleum that a grief-stricken emperor had erected for his wife who died during childbirth. There, Willinger met Sharma, a 32-year-old who made a living driving an autorickshaw, those three-wheeled green and yellow cabs. They married in a local court, Agra's police chief Shalabh Mathur told CNN. But their marriage soon headed into trouble and the couple started living separately over ""differences"" in their relationship, Mathur said. ""Both had allegations against each other,"" the police chief said, without elaborating. But the Indian Express newspaper reported that Sharma accused his wife of smoking too much and ""talking to other men."" The couple separated but were not legally divorced, Mathur said. On February 20, Willinger met Sharma again -- but police weren't clear why. Police said he drove her to a secluded spot in Agra and fatally stabbed her. He then went home and killed himself by igniting a gas canister in his kitchen that caused his house to explode.

"(CNN) -- Onyango Okech Obama -- an uncle of President Barack Obama who has been in the United States illegally for decades -- has gotten a federal court's OK to stay in his adopted country, according to an attorney representing the uncle. Federal immigration Judge Leonard I. Shapiro in Massachusetts agreed without argument Tuesday to allow the uncle, who has been living and working in U.S. for 50 years, to stay and obtain a green card, said attorney Margaret Wong. At the hearing, Wong said, the judge looked at Onyango Okech Obama's character, reviewing his long-term employment with a grocery store in Framingham, Massachusetts, his tax records and his rent payments, and noting that he is not on any government assistance programs. Shapiro also took into account federal immigration law that allows people who came to United States before January 1972 to apply for residency, Wong said, adding that her client has been living in U.S. since October 1963. ""I'm relieved, I represented the family for some time and it's really a relief,"" said Wong. In his testimony before the judge, according to Wong, Onyango Okech Obama mentioned that Barack Obama stayed with him for three weeks during the future president's student days, after he was accepted into law school. Wong called her client a proud, honorable gentleman who is quiet and very nice. In 2011, Onyango Okech Obama was arrested on drunk driving charges, and ordered to regularly check in with immigration, according to Brian P. Hale, then director of public affairs for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At the time of that arrest a federal law enforcement source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the defendant was not legally in the United States and had been previously ordered removed from the country. ""I'm so thankful that everything is finished,"" said Wong.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The remains of aborted fetuses were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer at a West Philadelphia abortion clinic, the city's chief medical examiner testified in the murder trial of the doctor who ran the facility. Medical Examiner Sam Gulino told jurors Monday he had to examine the remains of 47 aborted fetuses, some of which were frozen, as part of the investigation into the charges against Dr. Kermit Gosnell. Authorities accuse Gosnell, 72, of using scissors to sever the spinal cords of fetuses who emerged from their mothers still alive. ""There was no guidance on how to proceed,"" Gulino said, adding that the lacerated fetuses had to be thawed slowly so the tissue would not be destroyed. ""I was never asked to do that (before)."" Gosnell faces eight counts of murder for the deaths of seven babies and a 41-year-old Virginia woman, Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received repeated reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades, but had taken no action, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. When authorities searched Gosnell's office, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building. Jars containing the severed feet of babies lined a shelf. Furniture and equipment was blood-stained, dusty and broken. ""My grasp of the English language doesn't really allow me to fully describe how horrific this clinic was -- rotting bodies, fetal remains, the smell of urine throughout, blood-stained,"" Williams said. The remains, ranging in age from 12 to 28 weeks, were stored in a variety of non-medical containers such as a plastic water jugs or cat and dog food containers, Gulino testified during the fifth week of the trial. In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. In the courtroom of Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart, Assistant District Attorney Edward Cameron questioned Gulino about a series of graphic photos showing several fetuses with severed limbs and ""defects"" in the back of the neck that resembled holes. When a photo of a fetus was projected onto a pull-down screen, one juror gasped and shut her eyes, while several other jurors shifted in their seats and took notes. During the exchange, Gosnell, dressed in a suit and tie, removed his glasses and intently examined the image on a nearby monitor. Along with an examination chair with stirrups facing the jury box, a sonogram machine and other medical devices are on permanent display in the center of the courtroom. Gosnell's high-profile defense attorney, Jack McMahon, paced the courtroom during his cross examination, pressing Gulino to confirm that he could not absolutely determine that the infants were born alive. McMahon has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering the abortion drug Digoxin. Prior to dismissing the court Monday, Judge Minehart reminded jurors that there was ""enhanced media coverage"" of the trial and to ""remain vigilant"" in their order not to read, watch or listen to media stories relating to the proceedings. Meanwhile, a gag order remains in place preventing attorneys or the jury from speaking to the media. Also on trial is Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at Gosnell's clinic. O'Neill, who did not have a medical license, is not charged with performing abortions but with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization."" If found guilty, Gosnell could be sentenced to death.","Philadelphia's medical examiner had to thaw the remains of some fetuses .

"(CNN) -- A Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by Japan Airlines (JAL) was forced to land prematurely in Hawaii, after pilots shut down one of its engines. Flight JL002 with 171 people on board was en route from Tokyo to San Francisco when an oil pressure warning was received, forcing the pilots to terminate the flight eight hours in. ""At the approach to Honolulu the oil pressure was getting low, so the engine was shutdown,"" a JAL spokesperson told CNN. ""When one engine of an aircraft with twin engines is stopped, the airline must declare an emergency so the flight can have priority to be guided by air traffic control and apply for landing. ""There was no injured passenger or crew. ""It was not battery trouble; the cause is being investigated."" Hairline cracks discovered . The diversion came just days after Boeing's announcement that hairline cracks had been found in the wings of 40 in-production planes. While teething problems are common with most new models of aircraft -- the Dreamliner fleet was famously grounded in January 2013 after numerous problems with its battery -- Boeing admits that reliability is a work in progress. ""The Dreamliner has a dispatch reliability rate of 98%,"" Rob Henderson, Boeing's communications director Japan told CNN. ""But we're improving that all the time, to get it up to where the 777 and 737 are -- above 99%."" Dispatch reliability is the percentage of planes that leave within 15 minutes of the scheduled takeoff time, assuming no technical reasons for delay. The Dreamliner has a dedicated ""Operations Control Center"" that helps assist with problems as they occur. ""The center monitors every 787 in flight; it identifies problems and works with the airline to provide maintenance, sometimes even in flight,"" said Henderson. Media focus . Part of the Dreamliner's problem has been due to heightened media scrutiny, says Tom Ballantine, chief correspondent at Orient Aviation magazine. ""Because of the early dramatic grounding of the plane every little thing that happens now gets reported,"" he told CNN. ""But the Dreamliner hasn't really become a total nightmare. New models do historically have a lot of teething problems. ""The 747 had quite a few issues when it first entered service, and hairline cracks were also found in the wings of Airbus A380s (along with other problems). But none of this was a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft, which were repaired during downtime."" ""These issues with the 787 are certainly frustrating for the airlines but you can be sure they are being well compensated. All the airlines I have spoken to think it's a great plane with a fantastic future."" JAL said it was working with Boeing to identify the issue with the engine.

"(CNN) -- ""You press the button, we do the rest."" The words of Kodak's first advertising slogan, coined by its founder George Eastman in 1892, still seem relevant 120 years later, even among rumors that Kodak is considering bankruptcy. With the digital age upon us, the term ""point and shoot"" has developed a new meaning. But for those who grew up using -- and developing -- film, there was a lot more to photography than just pointing and shooting. CNN iReport contributor Lynn Kordus found that out the hard way. As a 17-year-old fan of the Beatles, it was only in her wildest dreams that she would attend their concert. Hanging out with them in their dressing room was unfathomable -- until 1965. ""My most memorable Kodak moment has got to be the day I spent 30 minutes with the Beatles,"" she told CNN iReport. Her Kodak Instamatic camera in hand, Kordus went backstage to meet the Fab Four in Bloomington, Minnesota. She realized too late that her one flashcube -- a disposable flash that had four one-time-use flashbulbs -- was missing a bulb. Her father had gone back to the car to get another cube but didn't return before Kordus was whisked backstage. She took photos of John Lennon flipping through a magazine, Ringo Starr acting goofy and George Harrison in the shower room tuning a guitar before her flashcube ran out of juice. She said Paul McCartney -- her favorite Beatle at the time -- looked around for an extra but couldn't find one. They took the photo anyway; the florescent lights brightened the room plenty. A problem of the film age: Not realizing until too late that the image would be underexposed. Without the additional light from the flash, the photo was too dark and didn't turn out. Her photo set with the Beatles was incomplete. ""My loss,"" she said. But having those other images made the surreal experience come to life. Not only did she have proof of her visit for others to see, but she said it was also validating for her: ""It really did happen."" Photos: Kodachrome collection looks back at mid-century America . Professional photographer and iReport submitter Lee Gunderson has been shooting with a Kodak since he was a kid, mastering his photography skills with the help of his father since age 4. The company's purportedly inevitable Chapter 11 saddens him. ""Kodak set the bar on color contrast, saturation and the parameters of color I look for,"" he said. This was something Gunderson believes Kodachrome in particular really excelled at. It was this film that National Geographic photographer Steve McCurry used for his famous 1985 ""Afghan girl"" image. Kodak stopped manufacturing that line of film in 2009 because it represented less than 1% of the company's film sales. Mastering film isn't easy, Gunderson said. ""You get good really quick or you go broke,"" he added. ""It's not like digital photography where you click away at no cost."" While he still uses film, Gunderson has noticed a sharp drop in its availability in stores. When processing fees are added -- at around $50 a roll -- the price jumps quickly. Still, he said, the quality just isn't there with digital, so for special occasions he still uses film -- and Kodak's Ektachrome 100 is one of his favorites. ""Kodak's trademark was rock solid,"" he said of growing up with the brand. ""It always performed; it was always reliable."" The popularity and usability of Kodak's cameras changed the way the world captured precious ""Kodak moments."" ""The Instamatic was the proverbial point-and-shoot,"" iReporter Kordus said. ""I liked the ease of shooting photos. It was simple. You didn't have to learn a lot."" ""Kodak film was the bread and butter of my career,"" Gunderson said. The brand will be missed, he added.

"(CNN) -- Maybe the American South is more complicated than anyone realizes. We seem to exist down here in a kind of a moral and physical duality. The land gives up bountiful crops while it also grows vigorous weeds. There is no other valid explanation for the actions of either Paula Deen or the U.S. Supreme Court. Deen, a televangelist of butter, let slip in a court deposition that she had used a degrading racial term to describe African-Americans. Imagine the surprise of almost no one in Dixie. Deen came of age in a country that was just beginning to institute the equality it had been bragging about for almost two centuries. If her childhood was like most Southern baby boomers, she was raised on the lexicon of discrimination, and probably used it. Un-ringing such a bell is not simple. Passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 meant that people who had been taught that it was socially acceptable to use terms like the N-word in public suddenly found themselves struggling with restraint on their language. Unable to exorcise the term from their vocabulary fully, they took it into private quarters and used it among friends who had similar experiences and sentiments. It is grossly foolish, though, to dismiss Deen's stumble as a minor ineptitude with speech. In certain cultural circles in America, racism abides. And sometimes it simply forgets to close the door. In tearful interview, Deen slams 'horrible lies' Apologists racing to Deen's side are equally awkward in their articulations of defense. Author Anne Rice fretted about our ""lynch mob"" culture crucifying Deen, seemingly oblivious to the racial freight hauled around when using such a phrase to defend a privileged, Southern white person. Less than 100 years ago a 17-year-old black farmhand named Jesse Washington was lynched on the courthouse lawn in Waco, Texas, chained to a tree and burned alive. Parts of his body were sold as souvenirs to a cheering crowd of 10,000. He had admitted to a murder many historians doubt he committed. How hard is it to understand that any ethnic person whose race has a history of being so victimized in a nation that espouses equality is likely to have a justified sensitivity to the bumblings of Deen, who had also expressed an offhanded interest in a ""plantation-style"" wedding dinner where the waiters were black males? Eatocracy: Paula Deen and Southern food: Critics say credit is past due . Deen might have argued that her attitudes were forever altered when a black man robbed a bank where she worked in 1986 and held a gun to her head. But sympathy is a tough emotion to conjure when reading her 2012 interview with The New York Times where she speaks of slavery as a familial relationship, not an injustice, and says, ""(F)or that reason we didn't see ourselves as prejudiced."" She also used the same forum to suggest that the freeing of her grandfather's 30 slaves was the cause of his suicide. Consequently, it is disturbingly wrongheaded for comedian Bill Maher to argue that what she said is ""just a word."" Words are powerful things. Words have changed the world. Regardless, it is still a bit awkward labeling Deen a racist when she had Pat and Gina Neely on her program so frequently that the African-American barbecue chefs became stars of their own cooking show. It is probably a gross oversimplification to suggest Deen didn't know any better because she lives in two parallel and contradictory environments. No such explanation is sufficient for the Supreme Court's ruling on the Voting Rights Act, either. Deen's sons: She's no racist . The court's perceptions are as confounding as Deen's. A conservative majority voted 5-4 that Congress used ""outdated facts"" to force mostly Southern states to seek federal approval for voting rules changes that affect minorities. We can infer from the opinion's language that the problem of racial discrimination in the former slaveholding states has been mostly resolved. Can we all share a ""hallelujah""? Unlike Deen's mishap, this news will generate surprise among minorities, particularly those living in Texas and Arizona. The high court had already ruled that the Texas Legislature drew congressional district lines in a manner ""designed"" to discriminate against minority representation, which, not surprisingly, meant nothing to Gov. Rick Perry and his Republican, conservative legislature. They recently readopted the plan that had been ruled unconstitutional. The high court also has a kind of Southern duality that puts it at odds with its own rulings. A week before the Voting Rights Act decision, the justices struck down an Arizona law that required people to show proof of citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. A judicial body that contradicts itself one week after a progressive ruling is struggling as much with the law as it is with the reality of the culture where it is employed. In the South, people understand how Paula Deen and judges can be as wrong as they are right. Unfortunately, there is considerably more at stake in this discussion than the buttery delights of a Southern cooking show. Regardless of how much we debate and legislate ourselves toward equality, we have not yet arrived. America seems immobilized by its history; we just can't stop staring at that tree on the courthouse lawn in Waco. And we wonder why we still haven't got this right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James C. Moore.","James Moore: Complicated South gives us actions of Paula Deen, U.S. Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- Like a combination of disinfectant and vomit. That's how a passenger on board a Royal Caribbean cruise described the ship's smell after hundreds of people fell ill. Shannon Blace went on the trip with her fiance and 10 other friends and family members. Of the 12, nine got sick, she said. One of the women in her group got sick twice. In total, 595 of the 3,050 passengers and 50 of 1,165 crew members have become ill, according to Bernadette Burden, a spokeswoman with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They reported vomiting and diarrhea. The cause of the illness is not clear, though the symptoms are consistent with norovirus, the cruise line said. Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis, which produces vomiting and diarrhea. Because of the outbreak, Royal Caribbean cut its 10-day cruise short. Explorer of the Seas left from Cape Liberty, New Jersey. It will return Wednesday, two days early. ""The number of reported new cases of gastrointestinal illness has dropped sharply after a spike in the first days of the cruise, and most guests who fell ill are up and about,"" the cruise line said in a Monday statement. ""The drop in new cases is encouraging. However, it is not unusual in an outbreak to still have smaller, secondary spikes. That is why, after discussions with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our medical team, we decided the most prudent course for the health of our guests and crew was to bring the cruise home on Wednesday, two days earlier than planned.""

He also approached her through the social networking site Facebook, using the name of the woman he has pleaded guilty to raping, and told her that he had sent the video to her mother, according to the report. Noel Kersh, a computer forensic examiner, said the case illustrates the double-edged nature of social media. ""A good rule of thumb is that anything that good guys use for good can also be used by bad guys for bad,"" Kersh told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell."" Davis lives in New Castle, Indiana. He was scheduled to be sentenced on the rape charge in Ohio in October, according to prosecutors in Preble County, outside Dayton. Attempts to reach his lawyer for comment were unsuccessful Wednesday. Davis now faces a variety of new charges, including criminal coercion, stalking, harassment, obscenity, receiving stolen property and violating protective orders. He was arrested in Delmont on August 15 after police found him sleeping in a car with a stolen license plate. Davis told police he was looking for the home of his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, the arrest report states. A box cutter and a .45-caliber pistol with several magazines of ammunition was in the car, and a quick check of his license turned up a restraining order against him, according to the report. The boyfriend's mother told police that Davis had been harassing his ex-girlfriend ""for several weeks,"" the report states.","Travis Davis has been charged with stalking, criminal coercion and other counts .

"Washington (CNN) -- The calendar reads April 2014, but in some ways it feels like it's April 2015, when the next race for the White House will be in full swing. And the early moves in the presidential campaign -- at least on the Republican side -- seem to be starting a lot earlier than they did last time. Friday evening Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, headlines a GOP Lincoln Dinner in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The same night Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky holds a rally in Dover, New Hampshire. The next day Paul, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and former Arkansas Gov. MIke Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential candidate, all speak at a major conservative conference in Manchester. A few days later, Cruz and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate, make the rounds in South Carolina. What do all these guys have in common? They're all contemplating bids for the White House in 2016. And what do the locations they're visiting have in common? They're all crucial early voting states in the presidential primary and caucus calendar, with Iowa kicking off the voting, New Hampshire holding the first primary, and South Carolina the first southern state to vote. ""There is some sense that the action is starting earlier than four years ago. In part, it's because this is the most wide open field on the GOP side in a generation,"" veteran New Hampshire Republican strategist Jim Merrill said. ""There's a sense that no one has a leg up. Because of that, everyone of the potential presidential candidates is trying to establish themselves and make their case in New Hampshire and elsewhere as early as possible, added Merrill, who was a top adviser to Mitt Romney in the Granite State in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Trips to early voting states . Talk about early. According to an informal CNN count, Paul and Cruz have already each made seven trips to the three early voting states since the start of 2013. Add in the five trips Santorum has made, the four trips each that Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal have made, along with the three that Huckabee has done and that two that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has made, and you've had one busy campaign calendar the past 16 months. ""Campaigns for president are no longer 12 month campaigns, they are now three or four year-long campaigns, especially for people who have to raise small donations, who can't write their own large checks. They have to start working these things early,"" longtime GOP strategist John Brabender, a senior adviser to Santorum, told CNN. While it's tradition that potential White House hopefuls make swings through the early voting states well before the midterm elections to reach out to voters, court local politicians, help raise money for local parties, campaign for fellow Republicans or Democrats, and start to reach out to donors and campaign strategists, the action started a lot earlier this cycle than it did in the last one. Most of the Republicans considering 2012 bids stayed out of the spotlight until after the 2010 midterms, and didn't formally announce their bids until the spring of 2011, much later than when the candidates in the 2004 and 2008 cycles launched their campaigns. Iowa GOP strategist Tim Albrecht says a stronger field this time around may be behind the earlier start. ""The level of top-tier candidates in 2016 far outpaces the carnival of contenders we saw in 2012. This year, the top tier has a much wider shelf, and a number of qualified governors and senators to sit atop it,"" said Albrecht, who served as a top adviser to longtime Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. What you are seeing is a qualified crop of candidates who understand they will have to earn every vote this year,"" added Albrecht. ""Better candidates equals better run and earlier campaigns and that's what we're seeing this year."" The Romney and Obama factors . Even though Romney's not running again, he might have something to do with the earlier start this time around. ""Romney was seen as the presumptive frontrunner four years ago. He set the pace and he penned the field up for a while,"" Merrill said. ""There's no heir apparent this time around."" Albrecht agreed: ""In 2012, Mitt Romney singularly owned the top tier and any votes he didn't get were largely protest votes. If you look at (Michele) Bachmann, Santorum, (Herman) Cain, (Newt) Gingrich, etc. last election, nobody conceivably thought they could be president, but they largely ended up as a protest vote."" Another factor: President Barack Obama's approval ratings were hovering around 50% at this point in the 2012 cycle. Now he's a term-limited president with approval ratings in the low to mid 40s. ""Given the discontent with the current administration, disappointment with Obamacare, and distrust of Democratic leadership, voters are looking for a strong conservative leader to restore confidence in our economy and government,"" said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist and radio talk show host who worked as a senior adviser for Huckabee in 2008 and for Santorum and Bachmann in 2012. Where are the Democrats? While the potential GOP presidential contenders criss-cross the campaign trail, the Democrats remain on the sidelines. Vice President Joe Biden gives the commencement address next month at the University of South Carolina, which will be his third trip to the Palmetto State in the past year. He's was in New Hampshire last month on an official White House visit on jobs and the economy. And last September, he headlined Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin's annual Steak Fry. And Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, another potential candidate, has swung through South Carolina and New Hampshire. But the traffic comes no where close to matching the miles the Republicans have logged. Obama is one reason. With a Democratic incumbent in the White House, 2016 party hopefuls have to carry a lighter footprint than their GOP counterparts. HIllary freezes the field . Another obvious reason: Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state says she'll decide by the end of the year whether she makes another run for the White House, and if she does launch a bid, she'll instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. ""I do think Hillary freezes the field in a way no non-incumbent ever has. Even Al Gore had an impressive primary opponent in Bill Bradley. Nothing tall grows in the shade, and Hillary casts a mighty big shadow,"" said Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and longtime adviser to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, who's also an adviser to Priorities USA, the super PAC set up to support Obama's 2012 re-election that's now raising money for a potential Hillary Clinton campaign. Democratic strategist Ben LaBolt said the vast difference in activity says a lot about the state of the race. ""The heavy campaign activity on the Republican side matches the level of uncertainty in the field -- we haven't seen such doubt about the presumptive nominee in several election cycles. On the Democratic side, that seems to be flipped, usually there is a lot of uncertainty leading to a crowded primary season, but whether it's Clinton or Biden, you've got widely known candidates who could scale up a robust campaign effort whenever they decide,"" added LaBolt, who worked for Obama from his Senate years through the 2012 campaign.","Republicans seem to be getting things going already .

"(CNN) -- A high school senior who filed suit against her mother and father for financial support and college tuition has returned to her home in Lincoln Park, New Jersey, the attorneys for her parents said Wednesday. ""Rachel Canning has returned home and reunited with her parents and siblings. Her return home is not contingent on any financial and/or other considerations,"" said the statement from the law firm Snyder & Sarno. The lawsuit has not officially been dropped, but Angelo Sarno, who is representing Rachel's parents, Sean and Elizabeth, said the family conflict has been resolved. ""The bottom line is it's over,"" Sarno said at a news conference. ""It's ancient history, it's done. They've welcomed her back into the house."" Canning, 18, alleged in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their home and that she was unable to support herself financially. The lawsuit asked that her parents pay the remaining tuition for her last semester at her private high school, pay her current living and transportation expenses, commit to paying her college tuition and reimburse her friend's parents for legal fees. Her parents said she left home because she didn't want to obey their rules. A judge last week denied the teenager's request for high school tuition and current living expenses from her parents. A date had been set for April on the other issues in the lawsuit. Canning, an honor student and cheerleader at Morris Catholic High School in Denville, said in court documents that she had to leave her parents' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment. She alleged, among other things, that her mother called her ""fat"" and ""porky"" and that her father threatened to beat her. Canning was suspended from school for truancy in October, according to court documents filed by her parents' former attorney, Laurie Rush-Masuret. Her parents told the teen that she could no longer see her boyfriend, who was also suspended from school. Car and phone privileges were also taken away. Once she learned of the punishment, Canning cut school again and then decided to run away, her father said in court documents. After receiving allegations that Rachel was being abused, New Jersey's Division of Child Protection and Permanency interviewed the teen, her parents and her two younger sisters, but they ultimately ""determined that allegation of emotional abuse was unfounded,"" a letter from DCPP states. Neither Rachel nor her parents were present at Wednesday's news conference. Sarno would not comment on what brought the reconciliation or whether Rachel was still in a relationship with her boyfriend. He asked that the public respect the family's privacy. ""This is a matter that should have been brought into some counselor's office, not into a courtroom,"" Sarno said. ""We just ask that you respect their wishes and give them some chance to resolve it."" CNN's requests for comment from Tanya Helfand, the attorney representing the younger Canning, were not returned. A request for comment from John Inglesino, whose family had been paying Rachel's legal fees and housing her for the past four months, also was unanswered. In court documents filed in New Jersey Superior Court Wednesday, Helfand wrote that only a few days ago, Rachel indicated that she could not go back home. But after speaking with her mother Tuesday, she decided to waive the complaint. If Rachel wishes to dismiss the lawsuit, it should ""be done of her own free will and not due to the extreme pressure of her parents and the media,"" Helfand wrote in court documents. Canning's case attracted national attention, which Sarno noted would likely continue to affect Rachel. He said the family is not expected to make a public statement, despite the amicable resolution. ""Nothing good could have come from this case. Absolutely nothing good. This kid is going to be affected long term from the attention,"" Sarno said. Fair or outrageous?

"(CNN) -- The television news anchor who misreported the names of the four pilots who were aboard Asiana Airlines Flight 214 when it crash-landed last week in San Francisco apologized Saturday for the screwup. ""Apologies to all upset by a story on Noon News,"" tweeted Tori Campbell of KTVU, a CNN affiliate in Oakland, California. ""A serious mistake was made @KTVU. My thoughts are w/victims of Flt 214 & families."" The bogus names phonetically spelled out phrases such as ""Something Wrong"" and ""We Too Low."" Campbell's apology followed by one day an apology by the National Transportation Safety Board for the ""inaccurate and offensive"" names that were erroneously confirmed by a summer intern. ""Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,"" the NTSB said Friday in a statement. Opinion: How to save your life in a plane crash . Campbell read the names during KTVU's noon broadcast on Friday, after which the news station apologized on air and on its website. ""Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again,"" KTVU posted on its website. The station said the names were confirmed by an NTSB official in Washington prior to air. It was not immediately clear who produced the fake names, but the NTSB said it was not the intern. ""The names were presented by the station, to the intern for confirmation,"" said NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. ""The intern did not make up the names and provide them to the station."" The NTSB said it does not release or confirm the identities of crew members or people involved in transportation accidents. ""We work hard to ensure that only appropriate factual information regarding an investigation is released and deeply regret today's incident,"" the NTSB statement said. The NTSB did not identify the intern, but said, ""Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated.""

"(CNN) -- It took him a while to get going in Australia but once he did, Lewis Hamilton proved just why he's the favorite to win the 2014 Formula One world championship. The Briton led a one-two for Mercedes on the first day of the new season, underlining the German marque's billing as the team who have adjusted best to the sport's new mechanical regulations. Hamiltion heads into the year's first race in Melbourne off the back of a productive preseason, but the early signs were less than promising. The 2008 drivers' champion failed to complete a lap during the first session of practice at Albert Park, but he recovered in the afternoon to lead the timesheets ahead of his teammate Nico Rosberg. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was third fastest. ""While it was disappointing to not get any track time this morning, these little hiccups are going to happen with the new cars and we'll have to get used to that,"" Hamilton, who's car had an oil sensor problem early on Friday, told the sport's official website after a lap of one minute and 29.625 seconds. ""It felt like I was on the back foot from there but then we got up to pace quite quickly in P2 and found the balance relatively fast. ""I feel quite comfortable in the car so overall it's a positive start but we need to look at the data now and understand where we are. ""We got a nice foundation for the weekend in the second session today so hopefully we can build on that in P3 tomorrow afternoon and then see where we are in qualifying."" Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel was beset by problems during testing, with the all-conquering Red Bull team struggling to get the best out of its Renault engine. But despite many fearing the worst for the four-time title winner, Vettel was fourth fastest -- over half of a second adrift of Hamilton. ""In a way it's a relief today, the fact that we were running, we didn't have any problems, the balance was good and the performance looked alright,"" said the German. ""In the end Friday times are not worth a lot, but it's better to be close to the top rather than somewhere towards the back, so I'm very happy with that. We will do what we can to prepare for tomorrow and Sunday, but let's see where we are then -- the most important thing is that we finish.""

"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama declared in Tuesday's State of the Union that a ""woman deserves equal pay for equal work"" and it's time for the nation to ""do away with workplace policies that belong in a 'Mad Men' episode,"" the House chamber erupted in an apparent display of bipartisan support rarely seen in today's Washington. You saw both Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner leading Congress in a standing ovation. Facebook reported a massive spike -- 33,000% -- in conversations immediately after the president's remarks about women and the gender wage gap. Twitter exploded with more than 33,000 tweets per minute. And I'm pretty sure that wherever he was, even Don Draper put down his Lucky Strike cigarette, stirred his Canadian Club whiskey, and rose to his feet in support. Obama's soft sell on income inequality . But as welcome as this seemingly bipartisan display of support for women may be, it stood in stark contrast to what has happened in the real world. It's been five years to the day since the President signed his first piece of legislation, the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which restored legal protections for women who are victims of pay discrimination. That law was intended to be a first step. But since then, Congress has been sitting on its hands when it comes to closing the gender wage gap. We need measures that will support women as they increasingly fill the role of both primary caregiver and primary breadwinner in today's American families. A standing ovation in a joint session of Congress will not put food on the table for 42 million American women living on poverty's edge. A standing ovation won't create workplace policies that keep them from having to choose between caring for their families and bringing home a paycheck. And a standing ovation certainly won't change the fact that women as a group still make only 77 cents on the dollar as compared to men -- even less if you are Black or Latina. Only action will. If 2014 is to be, as the President calls it, the Year of Action, there are things we can do right now to close this gap and help millions of women fully participate and thrive in our economy. State of the Union: Bravado vs. political reality . Congress can start by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act so that women can't get fired for asking their co-workers about their pay. As Lilly Ledbetter pointed out this week, ""How will a woman know she's being paid less if she can't ask?"" Today, nearly half of all workers labor in jobs where they are either prohibited by policy or discouraged by their employers from talking about their pay. They can face severe consequences if they do, including termination. The good news for Congress in this election year is that this issue has the support of most Americans, regardless of geography, gender, race or party affiliation. And if Congress fails to act, the President has been clear that he will. He's already raised the minimum wage for federal contractors. Another opportunity for action is an executive order that protects employees from retaliation by federal contractors for discussing their wages with co-workers. An executive order may not have the staying power of legislation, but it will move the needle for the approximately 25 million Americans working for federal contractors, many of whom are women. States can also be leaders in creating more gender equity in today's workplace.  Several states have adopted legislation strengthening their equal pay protections beyond what is required by federal law. Additionally, California, New Jersey and Rhode Island are providing paid family leave, and Connecticut now offers paid sick days. These states are demonstrating that change is not only possible, but can be profitable: Businesses have reported that with these policies in place, they have experienced reduced turnover and increased productivity and morale. And businesses need not wait on Washington -- as some are already proving.  Many have revised workplace policies to provide flexible schedules, paid family leave and paid sick days to help ensure women are not penalized in the pocket book for shouldering the lion's share of their family's caregiving responsibilities. Together we can close the gender wage gap and in so doing cut the poverty rate for women and their families in half and add nearly half a trillion dollars to the national economy. When we lift women, we lift America. But now it is up to us to act. We can't just tune out. You see, Don Draper is fiction. But the gender wage gap is very real. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maya L. Harris.","Maya Harris: Bipartisan applause doesn't square with Congress' record on gender wage gap .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of Christians gathered at one of Rome's most famous landmarks Friday night as Pope Francis led the Catholic ceremony known as the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum. Crowds of the faithful stood in solemn attendance, holding candles that cast a soft yellow glow over the ancient Roman site, as a giant cross made of dozens of flickering candles towered over the audience. The Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross, commemorates the passion and death of Jesus. Earlier, the Pope led a service at St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, also to mark Good Friday, the most solemn day of the Christian calendar. Roman Catholics worldwide use the day to reflect on the Gospel account of the day Jesus died on the cross, before his resurrection from the dead three days later on Easter Sunday, according to Christian doctrine. Holy Week, one of the most significant periods of the Roman Catholic year, will culminate on Easter Sunday with a Mass in St. Peter's Square, led by Pope Francis. On Holy Thursday, Pope Francis visited a home for the elderly and disabled, the Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, to wash the feet of ""12 disabled people of different ages, ethnicities and religious confessions,"" during a special Lord's Supper Mass, according to the Vatican. It was the second time he has broken with Vatican tradition and washed the feet of ordinary people rather than priests. Last year, he washed the feet of two women and two Muslims at a juvenile detention center in Rome. Before this, modern popes only washed the feet of 12 priests at the Vatican, during the Mass of the Last Supper. At his general audience Wednesday, Francis urged the faithful to seek an example in Jesus. ""This week, as we follow Jesus along the way of the cross, may we imitate his loving obedience to the will of the father, especially in times of difficulty and humiliation, and open our hearts to his gifts of reconciliation, redemption and new life,"" he said. CNN's Shelby Lin Erdman and Delia Gallagher contributed to this report.","Pope Francis leads the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum in Rome .

"(CNN) -- It came closer ... closer ... and then it started heading away. But you may not have noticed at all. An asteroid passed relatively close to Earth around 2:24 p.m. ET Friday. As scientists had been predicting all week, it did not hit. An unrelated meteor entered the atmosphere over Russia on Friday, hours before the much larger asteroid's fly-by, injuring about 1,000 people. Scientists say that incident was a pure coincidence. The larger asteroid, called 2012 DA14, never got closer than 17,100 miles to our planet's surface. Stargazers in Australia, Asia and Eastern Europe could see the asteroid with the aid of a telescope or binoculars. At the Gingin Observatory in Australia, the asteroid appeared as a bright white streak as viewers watched a live NASA video feed. Scientists are studying this asteroid so extensively that they can already predict its path for most of the 21st century, said Paul Chodas of NASA's Near Earth Object team. But it is only one of thousands of objects that are destined to one day enter our neighborhood in space. ""There are lots of asteroids that we're watching that we haven't yet ruled out an Earth impact (for), but all of them have an impact probability that is very, very low,"" Don Yeomans, manager of the Near-Earth Object Program Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at a press briefing. 5 things to know about meteors and asteroids . The long and short of it . The asteroid is thought to be 45 meters -- about half a football field -- long. Current estimates suggest that the Russian meteor -- which was a tiny asteroid before it hit the Earth's atmosphere -- was only 15 meters wide, making it much harder to detect. An object the size of asteroid 2012 DA14 appears to hit Earth about once every 1,200 years, Yeomans said. ""There really hasn't been a close approach that we know about for an object of this size,"" he added. The Science Seat: Yeomans talks about his work . On its close approach to Earth, it was predicted the asteroid would be traveling at 7.8 kilometers per second, roughly eight times the speed of a bullet from a high-speed rifle, he said. If it had hit our planet -- which was impossible -- it would have done so with the energy of 2.4 megatons of TNT, Yeomans said. This is comparable to the event in Tunguska, Russia, in 1908. That asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded, leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. Like that rock, 2012 DA14 would likely not have left a crater. What else is out there? So, we knew that this particular asteroid wasn't going to hit us, but how about all of those other giant rocks floating nearby beyond our atmosphere? NASA says 9,697 objects have been classified as near-Earth objects, or NEOs, as of February 12. Near-Earth objects are comets or asteroids in orbits that allow them to enter Earth's neighborhood. There's an important distinction between these two types of objects: Comets are mostly water, ice and dust, while asteroids are mostly rock or metal. Both comets and asteroids have hit Earth in the past. What would happen if the asteroid hit . More than 1,300 near-Earth objects have been classified as potentially hazardous to Earth, meaning that someday they may come close or hit our home planet. NASA is monitoring these objects and updating their locations as new information comes in. Right now, scientists aren't warning of any imminent threats. Yeomans and colleagues are using telescopes on the ground and in space to nail down the precise orbit of objects that might threaten Earth and predict whether the planet could be hit. Observatories around the world send their findings to the NASA-funded Minor Planet Center, which keeps a database of all known asteroids and comets in our solar system. NASA also has a space probe tracking asteroids to learn more about them. The Dawn probe was launched in 2007 and has already sent back dramatic pictures from the giant asteroid Vesta. The spacecraft is now heading to the dwarf planet Ceres. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive objects in the main asteroid belt. Although scientists know a lot about the path of 2012 DA14, there are many undiscovered near-Earth objects still out there. It's possible that a flash of light and shaking of the ground would be the first indications that something happened. With the Russian meteor, for example, there was no warning. Many teams of astronomers are using electronic cameras to find these near-Earth objects, but according to NASA, the entire effort consists of fewer than 100 people. New asteroid adventure in 2016 . A mission that's scheduled to launch in 2016 will teach scientists even more about asteroids. OSIRIS-REx will visit an asteroid called 1999 RQ36, take a sample of at least 2.1 ounces and bring it back to Earth. ""This is going to be the largest sample of an extraterrestrial object returned to Earth since end of the Apollo missions over 40 years ago,"" said Edward Beshore, deputy principal investigator for the mission, who is based at the University of Arizona, Tucson. The probe will arrive at the asteroid in 2018, study it, and then bring back the sample in 2023. 1999 RQ36 is made of materials ""almost identical to those that were present when the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago,"" Beshore said. That means studying this asteroid could yield greater understanding about the sources of organic molecules and water that gave rise to life. Because the asteroid is among those cataloged as a near-Earth object, the mission would further clarify the threat that this particular object poses, and better predict the orbits of other near-Earth asteroids, Beshore said. Scientists at the University of Arizona are collaborating with NASA and Lockheed Martin Space Systems on this mission. To better predict the orbits of hazardous objects, the group is looking at the Yarkovsky effect, a force created when the asteroid absorbs sunlight and re-radiates it as heat. The effect is, at first glance, quite small -- Beshore cited his colleague Steven Chesley's comparison of this effect to the force a person feels when holding grapes in a hand. But over time, it's an important consideration when trying to understand where an asteroid is headed. ""That force, applied over millions of years, can literally move mountains of rock around,"" Beshore said. But -- and we can't say this enough: Don't panic over it.

"Washington (CNN) -- A single word, ""Jewish,"" shows the delicacy of trying to forge a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Two weeks ago, President Barack Obama welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for White House talks by calling for two states -- ""a Jewish state of Israel and a state of Palestine"" -- that would coexist ""side by side in peace and security."" On Monday, Obama outlined a similar vision when he met with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, except for that one word, when he spoke of ""a state that allows for the dignity and sovereignty of the Palestinian people and a state that allows for Israelis to feel secure and at peace with their neighbors."" While the President clearly played to his respective audiences, the different language touched one of the stumbling blocks in getting Abbas and Netanyahu to agree to direct ""final status"" negotiations on an agreement to end the decades-long conflict between their people. At both meetings, Obama urged the visiting leaders to move past sticking points in the negotiating process, saying Monday that ""I believe that now is the time for not just the leaders of both sides but also the people of both sides to embrace this opportunity for peace."" Abbas, the Palestinian Authority President, noted the volatility of the entire Middle East region meant that ""we don't have any time to waste"" and that ""time is not on our side"" in reaching an agreement. A full-fledged deal seems about as far away now as it did eight months ago when Secretary of State John Kerry kick-started the peace process. So far, the process has included a series of meetings along with incremental steps intended to build trust, such as prisoner releases. However, Kerry's initial goal of an agreement by the end of the April has morphed into a possible framework for further talks through the end of 2014. Even that modest outcome remains uncertain, given the reluctance of both sides to move from deeply entrenched demands on the logistics of coexistence. With Israel's next release of Palestinian prisoners scheduled for later this month, the possibility of a breakdown looms. Both sides praise Kerry's seemingly endless energy for the issue, which has included multiple visits to the region to prod the two sides to reach a middle ground. The secretary of state attended Monday's meeting. ""Kerry's relentlessness and skill in engaging the parties have created a process that will at least survive the U.S.-imposed April deadline for a peace deal and live at least until year's end,"" Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars wrote in an opinion piece for CNN. While both sides have signaled agreement for the concept of a two-state solution in which Israel and an independent Palestinian nation would live side-by-side, they remain at odds over how to make that happen. Particular areas of disagreement include borders, security issues, the status of Jerusalem, and the rights of Palestinians who left of fled their homes in what is now Israel. In another potential sticking point, Israel insists on recognition by the Palestinians of its right to exist as a Jewish state. The issue made Obama's differing language all the more relevant.","NEW: Obama uses different language with Abbas than he did with Netanyahu .

"(CNN) -- Some fans are upset about an auction of items alleged to have been taken from the site of a fatal crash that killed ""Fast & Furious"" star Paul Walker. A pair of of Maui Jim sunglasses purported to have been worn by Walker during the crash, a fire extinguisher and and an alleged piece of debris from the accident scene have been put up for auction on BidAMI.com. According to a description on the site, the consigner of the lot of items up for auction was nearby when the fiery crash occurred on November 30, 2013, in the Santa Clarita, California, community of Valencia. The lot consigner collected the items ""once the site investigation was cleared with car debris hauled away and tape taken down,"" according to the description. ""As the consigner walked the scene in disbelief and grief, he found a pair of sunglasses nearby in the ivy,"" a description of the auction items on the site notes. ""After showing one of the officers, he was waved off. The glasses were dirty so he wrapped them in a handkerchief and put them in his pocket."" Walker and friend Roger Rodas died after the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT Rodas was driving slammed into a light pole and burst into flames. The New York Daily News reported that a rep from the auction site said the authenticity of the glasses was determined by the company using photos of Walker from the day of the crash. CNN has reached out for comment, but has not confirmed that the glasses did indeed belong to Walker. The sale announcement apparently garnered so much traffic that the BidAMI site crashed on Thursday. A Change.org petition has been started to stop the sale, and some fans have reacted negatively on Twitter. User Chloe Dawn tweeted, ""Someone is selling the sunglasses Paul Walker was wearing when he died. So disrespectful... what is wrong with people?"" The founder and editor-in-chief of the celebrity site Rickey.org tweeted, ""Some terrible person is selling the sunglasses that #PaulWalker was supposedly wearing when he died."" LA Weekly reported that police are doubtful that the glasses actually are those worn by Walker when he died. ""As a department we doubt that they are actually Paul Walker's sunglasses,"" a spokesman for the Santa Clarita sheriff's department told the publication. ""But who knows, maybe they are. Right now we doubt it."" At the time of his death, Walker was filming ""Fast & Furious 7,"" the latest in the very successful franchise that made him a star. On Thursday, Universal confirmed that filming of movie would resume March 31 in Atlanta, Georgia. The studio had earlier said they don't plan to kill Walker's character in the movie, but will instead ""retire"" him.","A seller claims to have found items at Walker crash site .

"(CNN) -- I have no idea why my 3-year-old wants to be a cowboy for Halloween this year, because she won't tell me. That's OK. I don't need to know her reasoning to make it happen. Thanks to her outdoorsy grandparents who live in the Colorado mountains, we already have the cowboy hat and handkerchief. We found a great pair of overalls on sale for $1.69 at the local Salvation Army store. But we still needed a cowboy jacket, a flannel shirt and boots. And whatever else might make her look like a 3-foot version of a cowboy. Entering a temporary Halloween store that popped up in our town, I headed to the kids' costume section. The little girls' costumes seemed odd to me -- so many little skirts attached to superheroes and vampires. Even if I could find a cowgirl costume among all the girly-girl stuff, my girl would probably find a cowgirl skirt pointless. How would she ride her toy horse with a skirt? Sidesaddle? As I turned toward to the boys' section to continue the search for accessories, I saw the costume that scared me more than any vampire or ghost: the little black dress. Posed seductively like a brown-haired version of JonBenet Ramsey, the child model on the package looked 4 or 5 years old. I couldn't imagine the photographer asking that little girl to pose that way. Previously on CNN: Parents, don't dress your girls like tramps . Americans are expected to spend $1 billion on children's costumes this year, up from $840 million last year, according to a National Retail Federation survey. From my limited scan of Halloween costumes on sale this year, sexy costumes for younger girls are flooding the marketplace. Many women I know have that little black dress, a somewhat slinky number that could be a cocktail dress or a basis for a suggestive black cat. But a grown woman makes a choice to dress in such a sexually suggestive outfit for Halloween or any other night of the year. She knows a sexy dress is going to garner a different reaction than Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, but she can take precautions to stay safe from the weirdos. A child has no idea what's going on. ""The message to our girls (with these costumes) is that they can't be too sexy, and they can't be sexy too soon,"" says Melissa Wardy, founder of Pigtail Pals, a clothing line for adventurous girls, who has blogged about sexy Halloween costumes. ""It's disgusting. She just potty trained. There's nothing sexual about her."" It can also be dangerous. ""Dressing girls like grown women for Halloween communicates that they have the sexuality of adults, in the bodies of children,"" says Teresa Downing-Matibag, an assistant professor of sociology at Iowa State University. ""While little girls themselves likely have very little awareness of adult or even adolescent sexuality, or what sex is really about, the adults who are seeing them on the streets do. We are also communicating to adults that little girls are sexually appealing, and this message has tragic implications for their vulnerability to sexual abuse."" The sexualizing of Halloween costumes for young girls is part of a larger marketing trend emphasizing girls' outsides over their insides, says Michele Yulo, founder of the Princess Free Zone, featuring superhero Super Tool Lula on T-shirts and in a new book. ""Marketers basically decide what is 'girl' and what is 'boy,' which ultimately leads to two very distinct ways to profit as well as a blind acceptance from the consumer who, often, doesn't realize it's happening,"" Yulo says. ""Girls are inundated from a very young age with inappropriate messaging by way of products like 'skinny' jeans for toddlers, or T-shirts that say, 'I'm too pretty to do homework, so my brother does it for me,' and sexy Halloween costumes. Kids begin to codify other kids by placing them in strict categories that they've been taught -- not born with. Inevitably, kids begin to believe that girls need to be sexy, and boys believe it, too."" What girls hear is who they are is how they look, and how they have to look is ""hot,"" which is creating problems for girls at an ever-younger age, says Peggy Orenstein, author of ""Cinderella Ate My Daughter: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the New Girly-Girl Culture."" ""Girls are learning at the youngest ages that their value comes from how they look, and the definition of attractive is very narrowly defined as being sexy or sassy (for the younger girls),"" Orenstein says. ""Sexuality is imposed upon them inappropriately, and they are encouraged to define their bodies -- not by how their bodies feel to themselves, but by how they look to others. This creates vulnerabilities for girls to the pitfalls we worry about -- distorted body image, eating disorders, depression and unhealthy sexual behavior."" Diane Murray of Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, has given up on store-bought costumes for her kids after ordering a SpongeBob SquarePants costume that turned out to be less than she had bargained for. Although it was supposedly the correct size for her 10-year-old daughter, ""the shirt was tight and the skirt was miniscule, barely covering her rear end."" ""I was thinking how embarrassed I would be to have her walk around in that costume, and she was embarrassed as well,"" Murray says. ""Dressing up as a sexpot is not part of my vision for a happy, healthy childhood. Outfits like that not only suggest a style of dress that is inappropriate but also emphasize the notion of dressing to titillate men, rather than dressing in clothes that make you feel good about yourself."" What can a parent do this Halloween to protect kids from growing up too fast? Emphasize your child's imagination. Yulo's daughter is going to be a baseball slugger -- no skirts please. How do you slide into home plate safely in a skirt? (Even though Geena Davis had to do it in ""A League of Their Own."") Murray's daughter is going as a Goth girl -- all black clothes and makeup. Other ideas: ""Girls can dress up as dragons, monsters, spies, secret agents, mummies, queens, and even Peter Pan and the Fairy Godmother,"" Downing-Matibag said. ""They can be Captain Hook, Santa Claus, the Lone Ranger and cowgirls, as well as lion tamers, scary clowns, astronauts, firefighters, sea captains, rock stars and Indy 500 racers."" Think comfort and safety. If your daughter will be running from one house to the next, make sure she wears shoes she can run in and warm clothing that protects her from the cold. If she's bundled up, she's not likely to be wearing that little black dress. Think cheap. My neighborhood listserv is filled with parent requests for costumes in specific sizes to borrow, rent or buy. I know someone is going to enjoy my daughter's infant ladybug costume this year. I received it a couple of years ago from another parent who had bought it first. There's also inspiration at your local thrift store, where I got part of my daughter's costume cheap. Make them.

"(CNN) -- Barbados Prime Minister David Thompson has died at age 48 of pancreatic cancer, the government of the Caribbean island said Saturday. Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stewart was sworn in as Thompson's successor hours after his death, according to the state-run Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Elected as prime minister in 2008 on a platform of community development, Thompson was credited for restoring the Democratic Labor Party to a parliamentary majority, according to the Barbadian government website. Thompson had served in government since 1991, and his main priorities were decentralizing government, strengthening social services and empowering the Barbadian economy, the government said. ""Barbados has lost its loyal son and faithful servant before he had the time to realize his lifetime dreams. ... We enjoyed and endured his public service experiences. He was always indebted to the people and the party for affording him the opportunity to see the mountain top,"" Thompson's wife, Marie-Josephine Mara said in a statement to the CBC.

"(CNN) -- A Cincinnati man charged with fatally shooting his 11-year-old daughter Thursday was denied a temporary release to attend the girl's funeral. Citing security concerns, state court Judge Nadine Allen denied a motion filed by a lawyer for Deandre Kelley, 34, who was charged with the shooting death of daughter Achauntiara Lanza during an argument with the victim's mother, according to bailiff Gail Ruth. Kelley's lawyer, Hugh McCloskey Jr., said the judge expressed concern that people might want to hurt his client or that his presence at the funeral could spark a dispute. ""This motion was requested because it was requested by Mr. Kelley's family, especially the deceased young lady's mother,"" he said. ""This is a family unit, whether we like it or not. They're suffering right now. In order to start healing, it's something they need to go through together."" The mother, who was not identified, could not be reached for comment. Prosecutors said Kelley showed up at slumber party Lanza was hosting at her mother's house in the early hours of of January 12 and argued with her mother. Kelley allegedly fired his gun into the air during the exchange, with an errant bullet striking Lanza in an upstairs bedroom. The girl, struck in the upper torso, was later pronounced dead at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Prosecutors said the dispute began hours before the shooting: Kelley and the victim's mother argued because he brought a gun into the home while the girl was having a slumber party with friends. Kelley left and went drinking. When he returned about 3:00 a.m., Kelley was intoxicated, prosecutors said in a statement. Children watching TV on the first floor let him in. The mother was upstairs sleeping. Kelley entered and fired a shot out of the front door. The girl's mother came down and ordered Kelley to leave. He fired two additional shots, one striking his daughter, who was hiding in an upstairs bedroom. Kelley, who turned himself in the next day, was charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, endangering children and having a weapon under disability -- a charge stemming from a prior conviction for cocaine possession. Kelley had three prior domestic violence charges involving the victim's mother -- which were dismissed when she failed to appear in court. ""There has been a lot of public discussion that the 'system' failed this family,"" Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph T. Deters said in a statement at the time of Kelley's indictment. ""This defendant has been charged with domestic violence three times and was never convicted because the witness would not cooperate. Now, in an incredibly senseless act, he has killed his daughter and the mother wants him to attend the funeral. He added, ""This is the end of the road for this enabling. He needs to be in jail and the rest of them should be looking in the mirror for the reason this little girl is dead."" Kelley, who has pleaded not guilty, is being held on bond $500,000 bond.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Some things returned to normal in Indonesia on Saturday after a volcano erupted two days before, but tens of thousands of evacuees were yet to return to their homes. The eruption of Mount Kelud shot hot ash into the sky, killing four people. The country's national air carrier, Garunda Airlines, resumed service to Central Java, an area covered in the gray ash. The airport in the city of Semarang reopened. Six more airports were closed in the wake of Kelud's outbreak. The inundation of ash in the air can be dangerous to jet engines. It also forced tens of thousands more out of their homes, the disaster management agency said Friday. Of those who died, two perished from smoke inhalation, while the third was hit by a collapsing wall. A fourth person died when ash caused a roof to collapse. Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said all the victims lived within a 7-kilometer (4-mile) radius of the volcano. Their villages were covered in nearly 8 inches of ash and were hit by large rocks, officials said. Mount Kelud, located in the eastern part of the main island of Java, had been spewing ash high into the air, as a smoke plume has risen from out of its crater into the sky. The government raised its eruption alert to its highest level overnight, and authorities have ordered an evacuation of all residents in a 10-kilometer (6.2 miles) radius of the volcano in eastern Java. At the height of the crisis Friday, 100,000 people evacuated. But by late Friday, a webcam from the nation's vulcanology society that is trained on the volcano's crater showed it to be calm. Mount Kelud last erupted in 2007, but it has ramped up activity in the past 10 days. In 1990, an eruption killed more than 30 people and injured hundreds.

"Washington (CNN) -- New disclosures that the Internal Revenue Service targeted liberals as well as conservatives in assessing applications for tax-exempt status have reshaped perceptions of the scandal, shifting the focus away from Republican claims of political villainy. IRS targeting included liberal groups . Investigations by the FBI, congressional committees, the Treasury inspector general's office and the IRS continue, but Monday's revelations bolstered assertions by agency officials and Democrats that the problem was egregious mismanagement instead of intentional misconduct by the Obama administration. Shifting polls contradict key deposition . House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California told CNN on Tuesday that the priority now should be to ensure that laws and regulations prohibiting political groups from getting tax-exempt status are properly enforced, regardless of whether organizations are on left or right. ""These groups are in some ways giving the appearance that their primary purpose is the common good, the common welfare ... when they are actively engaged in political activity, for which they shouldn't be getting a tax deduction,"" Pelosi said. However, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin argued too many questions remain unanswered to stop investigating whether politics played a role in the controversy. ""What we still don't know is who ordered this kind of targeting, why did it take so long for them to clean it up?"" Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, told CBS. Asked if the claim of political motivation now seemed less valid, he responded: ""I don't know the answer to that, so we're going to let the facts take us where they take us."" In particular, Ryan said he wanted more details on why conservative-oriented groups had their tax-exempt applications stalled and experienced harassing behavior by the IRS, such as having to answer inappropriate questions about the beliefs and activities of members. At the same time, he sounded like Pelosi in saying the bigger question involved the practice of targeting, rather than who specifically got targeted. CNN Poll: Did White House order IRS targeting? ""We know that the IRS did target people based upon their political beliefs,"" Ryan said. ""Who cares whether they're right or left? ... The fact that they're targeting people for harassment based upon their political beliefs should be cause enough alone for outrage."" That's a big change from inferences by GOP leaders in recent weeks that the Obama administration was likely behind the targeting that started in 2010 in an effort to subdue political rivals. With no evidence to date of any such connection, it was unclear how hard congressional committees would continue pushing the issue. The GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee has scheduled a hearing on Thursday on an initial review of the IRS targeting by the agency's temporary leader, Daniel Werfel. President Barack Obama appointed Werfel to clean up the IRS mess last month after an inspector general's audit uncovered targeting of applications that contained conservative-themed words such as ""tea party."" The audit by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George only cited the targeting of conservative groups, which it said ended in May 2012. Read IRS watchdog's report . In his first substantive report on the agency, Werfel said Monday that its tax-exempt unit used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax-exempt applications until earlier this month, more than a year later than previously revealed. The ""Be on the Lookout"" or BOLO lists included liberal-themed words such as ""progressives"" and other politically oriented terms such as ""occupy"" and ""medical marijuana"" in alerting IRS workers to check for unacceptable political activities, according to copies made available by Democratic Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan. Werfel said he has suspended the use of BOLO lists in considering tax-exempt applications for now. A statement by Levin questioned why George's audit focused only on BOLO lists that contained conservative labels. The inspector general's report ""served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations, and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way,"" Levin's statement said. A spokesperson for George later responded that the report focused only on BOLO criteria used to refer cases for extra scrutiny of potential political activity that would make groups ineligible for tax-exempt status. Republicans have claimed the controversy amounted to political retribution against enemies of the administration, an accusation denied by the White House and the IRS. McConnell: Obama administration a 'culture of intimidation' In response to Levin's statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp, R-Michigan, said the inclusion of ""progressives"" on a BOLO list did not prove that liberal groups underwent the same extra scrutiny of conservative groups cited in the inspector general's report. The release of George's audit last month ignited a political firestorm in Washington while fueling conservative mistrust of Obama's administration as an example of big government gone wild. Werfel noted Monday that his internal investigation, while still incomplete, found no evidence so far of intentional wrongdoing by IRS personnel or involvement by anyone outside the IRS. He also said no evidence had emerged that in appropriate targeting extended into other areas of the agency. Five IRS managers have been replaced, from the previous acting commissioner whom Werfel succeeded to the head of the unit based in Cincinnati that handles tax-exempt applications. In addition, Werfel created an Accountability Review Board to recommend within 60 days ""any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible"" for the targeting disclosed by the inspector general's report. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that Obama believes Werfel's report ""is an important step in ensuring accountability for any staff that acted inappropriately, identifies the failures in their systems that allowed the misconduct to happen, and takes a forward-looking systemic view at the agency's management."" In his audit that disclosed the misconduct, George said there was no evidence of a political motive. However, he is continuing to investigate the matter, along with the FBI and the congressional committees. As part of his review, Werfel said 80 groups awaiting IRS action on their applications for tax exempt status for more than 120 days could self-register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations. At the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax-exempt status. Regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities, while political groups are considered ineligible. Confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the IRS, Werfel said. An IRS statement on Monday said the ""safe-harbor"" option for self-certification would apply to groups that ""certify they devote 60% or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare."" ""At the same time, they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40% or less of both their spending and time,"" the statement said. Applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self-certification, it said. Earlier: What's a 501(c)(4)? Werfel said the IRS would continue checking on tax-exempt groups to ensure they were following the law. Separately, the House Oversight Committee, which has been aggressively investigating the IRS matter, plans to meet on Friday to consider a resolution aimed at resolving questions about whether a key agency official must testify. Lois Lerner was the director of exempt organizations when the agency filtered applications for tax exempt status. She appeared before the committee in May and said she had broken no laws or regulations and then invoked her constitutional right not to answer questions. Lerner pleads the 5th . Several committee Republicans questioned whether she waived that right by making her opening statement, and Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa said she could be called back at a later date if that were the case. CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Liberal and conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status got targeted .

"(EW) -- Russell Crowe's grungy beard — presumably as well as other elements of Noah -- drew in $44 million this weekend, perching it atop a Mount Ararat of box office receipts with a moderately impressive sum by any measurement (including cubits). Darren Aronofsky's Biblical bonanza took the No. 1 spot, knocking all the films from last week's Top 5 down one slot. The theologically loose adaptation fared better than the last time Crowe went gallivanting around in a tunic, in 2010′s Robin Hood. (That period epic only made $36 million in its first weekend.) However, there wasn't exactly a rainbow at the end of the storm, considering audiences gave Noah a ""C"" CinemaScore rating. The Divergent Games: City of Bones — er, Divergent -- couldn't quite muster enough YA fandom or non-reader interest to push its to-date take over the $100 million mark. The fantasy drama sits comfortably in a distant second with $26.5 million for the weekend, making for a grand total of $95.3 million. With a reported budget of $85 million, this certainly isn't a dystopian scenario for the proposed trilogy, but it is less than half of what both films in The Hunger Games series had made by the end of their second weekends. In third place, Muppets Most Wanted slipped only 33 percent from its opening weekend to $11.4 million, bringing its total up to $33.2 million. The film — a sequel to the 2011 reboot of the beloved Jim Henson characters — isn't performing quite as strongly as its predecessor, but as Kermit knows, it ain't easy making green. The other family-friendly film on offer, DreamWorks Animation's Mr. Peabody and Sherman, followed up in fourth with $9.5 million. Putting Judeo-Christian-based films both on the top and bottom of this weekend's Top 5, the pro-deity tract God's Not Dead found an additional $9.1 million in the collection plate this Sunday, bringing it to more than $22 million all together. Ah-nold's drug bust thriller Sabotage, on the other hand, seems to have been forsaken, belly-flopping into seventh place with only $5.3 million — pretty dismal for a movie with so much supposed star power. Here's the Top 5: . 1) Noah -- $44 million . 2) Divergent - $26.5 million . 3) Muppets Most Wanted -- $11.4 million . 4) Mr. Peabody and Sherman - $9.5 million . 5) God's Not Dead -- $9.1 million .

Five years after the global financial system came perilously close to collapse, the global economic outlook is still uncertain. In Europe, GDP is still below pre-crisis levels and unemployment is at a record high. Recovery in the United States, although stronger, remains weak by historic standards, and even China, which has done so much to drive global growth, is slowing down. Yet, in what some might call an unexpected twist, average growth in Africa over the last decade has been more than 5%. Of the 10 fastest-growing global economies, seven are in sub-Saharan Africa. But how will this economic spike be sustained? How do we ensure we continue along this trajectory? Read more: Africa's giant infrastructure projects . It is the world's appetite for Africa's rich natural resources which, up to now, has been the major driver of this stellar record. And it is this same appetite that will provide both the opportunity and the solution for Africa to sustain these economic achievements. While not all African countries are commodity rich, the continent has 12% of the world's oil reserves, 40% of its gold, and 80% to 90% of its chromium and platinum. Africa is also home to 60% of the world's underutilized arable land and has vast timber resources. The idea that these abundant natural resources can be the driver for an industrial revolution across the continent is growing. The latest edition of the Economic Report on Africa (ERA 2013) sets out how the continent's future will be determined by how policies that promote commodity-based industrialization are designed and implemented. We believe that such a transformation is both imperative and possible. But it requires courage, vision and a new mindset from the continent's business and political leaders to overcome the challenges which continue to hold back the building of a successful and dynamic industrial base in Africa. Read more: Ethiopia bids to be Africa's powerhouse . There is no one-size-fits-all solution to accelerating resource-based industrialization. But important lessons can be learnt from the success of countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Venezuela in promoting value addition, new services, and technological capabilities. Malaysia, in particular, is a perfect example of how a commodity-based economy was transformed, through focused state interventions and an allocation of resources towards the industrial sector, to a high-income and diverse manufacturer in only a few decades. Through a series of five-year development plans, centered on a vision to transform the structure of the economy and raise incomes in the medium- and long-term, investment was oriented towards industry. Today, Malaysia is a key manufacturer and exporter of a wide range of goods and services. It is clear that governments, both individually and collectively, have an important role. A supportive policy and investment framework is essential to attract long-term investors. Policies to build local capacity and address inequality are essential. Moreover, developing skills through training and incentives will ensure that local economies are able to grow and diversify. Ozwald Boateng: New wind of change is blowing through Africa . However, a barrier to Africa's industrialization that is not often talked about is the mindset of private sector leaders -- both in and outside Africa. Many are still indulging in the same historical rent-seeking attitudes that have resulted in the short-terms gains of crude, cocoa and gold sales. More business leaders need to change their thinking and understand that short-term revenue gains -- as opposed to long-term value addition -- offer little or no contribution to sustainable economic growth. We are now seeing a new style of African business leader emerging -- leaders who are building, investing, growing for Africa's future. It is their efforts which will provide the jobs and income which will have the biggest impact on tackling poverty and driving wider social progress. Africa's private sector must take the lead in improving coordination between farmers, growers, processors, and exporters; in increasing competitiveness in the value chain, and ensuring the price, quality, and standards that market demands are met. Read this: How Africa's natural resources can lift millions out of poverty . We need to see national and regional champions created and supported, and help foster effective collaboration between public and private sector and the development world. This is the essence of the emerging economic philosophy called Africapitalism, a private sector led partnership mode focused on Africa's development. We have already seen real progress on the continent. Ethiopia's leather industry is not only developing fast but is also increasing high-value-added activities. South Africa and Egypt are making similar strides. In Ghana and Zambia, the cocoa and mining sectors have long contributed to wider socioeconomic growth. In East Africa, the success of Kenya's fresh vegetable producers in adding value to their exports has been remarkable. But when Africa only sees some 10% of the income from its own coffee crop, we can see that much work still needs to be done. Africa now has the chance, as never before, to shape its own economic future through industrialization. This will help to spread prosperity throughout the continent. An industrialized Africa will also provide a much-needed new driver of global growth. It is in everyone's interest that Africa succeeds.

"London (CNN) -- In a career already groaning under the weight of titles and accolades, Roger Federer joined another exclusive list of tennis luminaries when he beat Andy Murray in this year's Wimbledon final. In notching up his seventh Wimbledon win a month before his 31st birthday, Federer became the oldest champion since Arthur Ashe in 1975, and only the 11th player in the Open era to win a grand slam in his 30s. Only Andre Agassi (at the Australian Open in 2001 and 2003) and Pete Sampras (U.S. Open 2002) have achieved the feat this century suggesting that, more than ever, modern tennis is a game which favors the power, agility and the sheer exuberance of youth. Despite the ambition of those young guns and not forgetting the distractions of a young family, Federer's desire to remain competitive appears undimmed. After dispatching the then 23-year-old Juan Martin del Potro in the final of the ATP Tour event in Rotterdam last February, Federer said he hoped to be around for another ""three, five, six years."" And following his silver medal at the Olympic tennis tournament in August he reiterated that wish. ""I'll be 35 in Rio. I think it's possible, but we'll see how it goes,"" Federer told CNN. The Swiss champion isn't the only one enjoying a resurgence in the autumn of his career. From his perch at the summit of the world rankings -- which he reclaimed after winning Wimbledon -- Federer surveys a top 100 in which almost a quarter (24) of players are over the age of 30. Five places below the Swiss is Spain's David Ferrer (who turned 30 in February) while lower down lie Jarkko Nieminen from Finland and Austria's Jurgen Melzer. The 31-year-olds, ranked 35 and 37 respectively, have both won tournaments this year -- the Finn winning the Apia International in Sydney in January while Melzer took the Memphis title the following month. Germany's Tommy Haas, who turned 34 in April, is currently the oldest player in the top 25. The former world no.2, whose career has been plagued by injuries, started this season outside the top 200, but has shot up the rankings this year to a current high of 21 in the rankings. The rise was helped, in part, by victory over Federer in the final of the ATP tournament on home soil in Halle last June. ""Maybe 30 is the new 20,"" the German told CNN's Open Court, not entirely in jest. ""You know, I think a lot of the guys are becoming so much more professional ... everybody is looking more at how physical the game has gotten and how important it is to stay healthy and fit,"" Haas said. ""Thirty, at the end of the day, is really just a number ... If you really love something and you want to do it the right way, why not do it until you really know you can't do it anymore."" It's a philosophy which Federer shares, Haas thinks. ""He's a world-class athlete. He knows exactly what he is doing. He prepares as well as anyone out there ... he doesn't second guess many things, so I'm not really surprised."" Gil Reyes, the feted long-time fitness coach (and friend) to Andre Agassi, says Federer is just a class apart. ""Roger is a perfect athlete -- his movement, his game, his mental, his physical. There's Roger and then there's everyone else,"" Reyes said. Technological advances and the physically demanding nature of the modern game have caught up with players less gifted and younger than Federer, says Reyes, leading to lots of wear and tear. With players hitting that ball harder than ever, there is simply less time to play the next shot, he says. ""You're going to be out of position unless you redirect your body very forcefully and very violently, and that's just taking its toll on our knees and our hips. So you have to counter that and prepare your body for the game,"" Reyes said. Watch: Boris Becker tours his hometown . Preparing his body for the game enabled Agassi to play with ""great relevance"" right up to age of 36, says Reyes. The American's latter playing years were the most fruitful of his career with five of his eight grand slams won after his 29th birthday. He was also world no.1 at the age of 33. ""When you stop and think about it, that's amazing,"" Reyes says. Strength was the key to Agassi's enduring success, Reyes believes, who recalls ""a rather slender fellow"" when they first met in 1989. But together they devised a fitness program tailored to the stresses and movements Agassi experienced on court. ""If we were doing certain running drills, he would say: 'I don't feel that on my legs the way I do on the tennis court.' That was beautiful because then he would leave it to me to come up with the training,"" Reyes said. Reyes would also tailor gym work depending on the playing surface -- the high bounce at Roland Garros requiring different strength training to the skiddy low bounce of the All England Club's grass courts. ""I can say, honestly, that he was, if not the strongest player on the tour, one of the strongest. Playing to 36 in this day's game it takes a lot."" Reyes thinks the next generation of tennis stars will reap the benefits of improving sports science but does not envisage too many current players emulating Agassi, with one notable exception, perhaps. At the start of the year, a back injury forced Federer out of the Qatar Open in Doha. It was only his second withdrawal during a tournament in his career and prompted speculation that 2012 might be a year of diminishing returns for the great champion. Ten months on, Federer has a further six titles under his belt, and heads towards November's season-ending ATP World Tour Finals with just his own records as the oldest winner and six-time champion to beat.","Roger Federer continues to be a major force in the men's game despite his advancing years .

"(CNN) -- It may have a fairy tale ending -- a story of perseverance and second chances that's playing out live on the public stage of online networking. Brianna Karp's trailer now sits outside a friend's home near Los Angeles . But 24-year-old Brianna Karp's story started as a nightmare. In a rocky economy, Karp was laid off from her Irvine, California, job as an executive assistant in July 2008. She got by for a while on temp jobs and unemployment benefits. But when her savings dried up, she was no longer able to afford her rent. The only answer she saw then was a trailer she'd inherited from her father -- a man she barely knew who had recently committed suicide. ""I was left with a truck and this camper, which I was going to sell but coincidentally this happened to me,"" she said. ""I thought, 'Well, I have this.' "" Karp, who writes that she is also estranged from her mother, ended up camped in a Los Angeles-area Walmart parking lot. ""The first night, I think, in the Walmart parking lot was the scariest,"" she told CNN. ""I was panicking, and I was just afraid."" For comfort, she had her mastiff named Fezzik. And she had her laptop computer. As she spent five months looking for jobs and blasting out resumes, often spending hour after hour at a coffee shop to take advantage of its free Wi-Fi connection, she also started blogging. The result, the Girl's Guide to Homelessness, chronicled the ups and downs of her new life. She reminisced about adopting her dog, named for a character from the movie ""The Princess Bride,"" and mulled the pros and cons of having a pet while homeless. She recounted details from failed job interviews and offered tips for other homeless women. ""I was trying to stay positive and cheerful,"" Karp said. ""I started writing the blog in a tongue-in-cheek way to kind of laugh about my circumstances, keep them chronicled. I didn't think anyone would actually read it.""  Watch CNN's Ted Rowland's report on Brianna. » . But people did, including Matt Barnes, formerly homeless himself and running a Web site about his own homelessness issues in Scotland. He asked her to write for his site and would eventually become Brianna's boyfriend. Another big break came through a shot at the weird world of reality television. Karp applied for a show that would offer contestants the chance at a job with Elle magazine advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. She was granted an audition for the show and, by her own account, totally botched it. ""I went back and blogged about bombing the interview and made fun of myself,"" she said. On a lark, she then wrote to Carroll via her column. ""Dear E. Jean: I'm currently homeless and living in a Wal-Mart parking lot,"" her e-mail began. ""I'm educated, I have never done drugs and I'm not mentally ill. I have a strong employment history and am a career executive assistant. The instability sucks, but I'm rocking it as best as I can."" She told Carroll about her poor interview for the show and finished the note with the question, ""How does one get another shot when one screws up a job interview? -- Homeless, but Not Hopeless."" Carroll said she was floored by the note. ""[The phrase] 'I'm living in a Walmart parking lot' hooked me,"" she said. ""I thought, she's so ready to work, obviously she can write, she's got some skills."" Her response appeared in the August issue of Elle -- she offered Karp an internship and a chance to write a fashion blog for the magazine. ""I think she's a new voice,"" Carroll said. ""She's a voice we haven't heard, and I'm excited for her future."" Not that all of her troubles were instantly over. Last month, she wrote, Walmart finally had her trailer towed, and she has now parked her mobile home at a friend's house outside Los Angeles. She's also still seeking that elusive full-time job, while hoping her newfound high profile will help spread the word about homelessness, and how it can happen to the most unlikely people. ""If you saw me walking down the street, you wouldn't assume I live in a parking lot,"" she writes on the blog. ""In short, I am just like you, except without the convenience of a permanent address."" CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","24-year-old went from being executive assistant to homelessness after layoff .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Carson Yeung Ka-sing, a Hong Kong tycoon and owner of British soccer club Birmingham City, was jailed for six years Friday for laundering HK$721 million (US$93 million). The 54-year-old businessman was convicted by a court in his home city earlier this week. ""The sentence must include an element of deterrence to discourage those who are in a position to exploit the system,"" said Judge Douglas Yau. ""Maintaining the integrity of the banking system is of paramount importance if Hong Kong is to remain an international finance center."" Yeung previously denied the charges that he had laundered money between 2001 and 2007 during a 50-day trial that he had twice tried to halt, according to local Hong Kong media. His father, Yeung Chung, a co-accused, died in 2012. Yeung was arrested and charged in Hong Kong in June 2011, two years after he acquired the ""Blues."" Blues control . Yeung, little known prior to his emergence in English football, took control of the club in October 2009 in an 81-million pound ($130 million) takeover. At the time, he was only the second Asian, after deposed former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, to own a British premier league club. In February, Yeung resigned as chairman and executive director of Birmingham International Holdings Limited (BIHL), which owns the struggling second-tier club. Throughout the trial, Yeung said he accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars through stock trading, business ventures in mainland China, gambling and even hairdressing. He claimed he made HK$20 million as a hairdresser, catering to movie stars and businessmen from a chain of upmarket salons, one of them in Hong Kong's five-star Peninsula Hotel. The prosecution will apply net month to confiscate some of Yeung's assets. CNN's Wilfred Chan contributed to this report.","Owner of British soccer club Birmingham City Carson Yeung jailed for 6 years .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Jun Kitagawa's foray into public art didn't spring from an epiphany or a burst of passion. It came from hundreds of unwanted white T-shirts stuffed inside cardboard boxes in his Tokyo apartment. Seventeen years ago, Kitagawa decided to make T-shirts with images of women in poses so provocative they'd make American Apparel blush. But no one wanted to buy them. ""It was very disappointing, of course,"" Kitagawa tells CNN. One day, he scrambled into a park and dressed a nude sculpture with one of his unloved white tees. He snapped some pictures then removed the shirt. He showed the pictures to friends. ""Some people would say 'that's very interesting,' and some would get mad,"" says Kitagawa. Either way, the photos elicited strong reactions. Obscene vandalism or public art? Whether he's dressing nude, Romantic era-styled statues in white tees, creating voluminous balloons shaped like human buttocks or setting up gigantic 3D zippers to protrude out of traditional Japanese gardens, Kitagawa's public art in Japan is whimsical, erotic and playful. There's a sense that his work functions like a wink -- a reminder not to take everything so seriously. He takes something vaunted as high art, such as a classical nude statue, with romanticized human proportions and a stately countenance, and mixes it with a white T-shirt. ""I want to make a work that takes two extreme elements -- the highest and lowest elements,"" he says. Some critics say his work isn't even art -- that it's vandalism or a prank or even obscene. ""Whether the audience sees my work as pleasing or disturbing, the visual impact that jolts people awake is an essential part of my work,"" Kitagawa says. When still in his 20s, Kitagawa quit his job at an architectural firm to become an artist. Since his father was a landscape painter, Kitagawa says he felt becoming an artist would be a practical profession. He became an assistant to a sculptor, learning techniques and working with metals and clay. These days, he asks for permission . Kitagawa is a slender man with a slight goatee, his hair underneath a pink and green newsboy hat. He moves quickly, light-footed, almost like a cat -- a trait that served him well back when he had to sneak a ladder into a park to put a T-shirt on a sculpture. These days, he seeks permission before dressing sculptures in public places. Usually he gets denied, or receives no response at all. He says he's still surprised when officials approve his requests. In the spirit of pop-up art, he removes the shirt from the sculptures after about 7-10 days. ""I just want to let people walking by know something is going on,"" Kitagawa says. ""I want to change something from the ordinary."" Kitagawa also does more traditional work, decorating Japanese festivals, cultural events and the occasional shopping mall. In several temporary installations, Kitagawa has toyed with zippers. One giant zipper stretches through a quiet Japanese garden at the Chinzanso Hotel in Tokyo. Another ran through a house in Tokyo, exposing its flooring and structure beneath. (The house has since been demolished.) One of his zipper works currently on display at the Roppongi Tunnel was commissioned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to clean up graffiti. ""The zippers convey that what we are actually seeing in this real world is just a surface, and that once we peel it off, we see there's another hidden space, which is completely different from our side,"" he says.","Jun Kitagawa has created pop-up installations throughout Japan .

"(CNN) -- The government of Lebanon cried out to the world for help Monday over the strain the civil war in neighboring Syria is putting on its country. It needs a record amount of cash. The exodus of people fleeing lives and homes ripped apart by bombs and bullets for the safety of Lebanon does not want to abate. Aid workers from 60 agencies need more money than ever to tackle the mounting humanitarian crisis. And the coffers are nearly empty. Next year's budget is only 5% funded so far, the United Nations says. The government in Beirut made an official plea for donations to help cover the $1.89 billion the U.N. thinks is needed. It reflects the growing multitude of refugees throughout the region and burgeoning budgets needed to fund their care. The U.N. said Monday that $6.5 billion, a record amount, will be needed next year to cover a projected 4 million Syrian civil war refugees and the communities they have flooded into. That is nearly double the 2,304,128 externally displaced people currently registered. One-fifth of the people living in Lebanon's borders are now refugees from Syria's war. That's the official figure; the real one could be much higher, as the U.N. count has typically not been able to keep up with the influx of people who have lost everything. Their impoverishment is straining resources for locals as well. Lebanese in trouble . It is pushing many locals toward desperation in the nation, which is politically polarized between those who oppose Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and those who support him. Lebanese terror organization Hezbollah is fighting alongside his soldiers against rebels trying to topple him. The U.N. counts 842,500 registered Syrian war refugees in Lebanon, but hordes more are unregistered. The U.N. expects the official number to climb to 1.5 million next year. The same number of Lebanese will be in need of help, it says. Lebanon hosts 36% of the refugees piling into countries in the region, and it's a small country, with an official population of 4.4 million people, according to the World Bank. Nearly 1,600 refugee camps dot Israel's northern neighbor, which is smaller than the state of Connecticut. A third of the registered displaced people live in substandard shelters, the U.N. says. Nearly 300,000 of the Syrian refugees in Lebanon are school-age children, and the U.N. expects the number to more than double in 2014. The government and aid agencies are asking for money to provide food, education, sanitation, security, shelter and other needs.","NEW: Funding call to handle the entire refugee crisis breaks record as well .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona woman is accused of injecting feces-laced fluid into her 66-year-old husband's IV as the couple was alone in his recovery room following his surgery, police said. Rosemary Vogel, 65, of Sun Lakes, was arrested after a warning alarm on the IV monitor sounded Thursday. She is now charged with attempted first-degree murder and vulnerable adult abuse, according to police and CNN affiliate KTVK. Her husband, whose name wasn't released by authorities, is expected to survive as he recovers in Chandler Regional Medical Center, said Sgt. Joe Favazzo. KTVK reported that Vogel is a registered nurse and was a hospital employee at one time, according to the probable cause statement written by police. Vogel's attorney couldn't immediately be reached for comment. ""This is the first that I've heard where fecal matter has been injected into an IV system,"" Favazzo told KTVK. After the IV monitor alarm sounded, the hospital staff entered the recovery room and found Vogel manipulating her husband's IV, police said. The hospital found a brown substance in the IV line and immediately removed it from his arm, police said. Vogel allegedly tried to drain the fluid from the line into a waste basket, but a nurse intervened, police said. A test revealed the fluid contained fecal matter, police said. Vogel's purse contained three more syringes. Two of them contained fluid, and the third appeared to have trace amounts of fecal matter, police said. Police don't have a motive, Favazzo said.

"(CNN) -- Investigators now say that, according to automated electronic connections attempts by the ACARS data reporting system of Malaysia Flight 370, the airplane flew far to the west, in an entirely different direction than it should have been heading as per its original flight-planned route, which was to the north. The 90-degree turn to the west might have been purely random if entered by a nonpilot or inexpert pilot who knew simply how to turn a single knob (called the heading bug) that could command the autopilot to make a turn to a new heading (or direction). There is strong evidence that this is not what happened. Investigators now believe, according to news reports, that after its transponder and ACARS radio were turned off, turns were initiated at GPS waypoints. These waypoints are essentially virtual checkpoints in the sky, defining markers charted by airspace regulators that create pathways in the air that airplanes follow to keep safely separated from each other. The waypoints are defined by an exact latitude and longitude and can be located by a number of the airplane's various navigators, including GPS. If the reports of the flight path are true, it is not a route that could happen by accident. There are two ways the 777-200 could have flown on this path. After passing one waypoint, it could have been directed to fly to the next waypoint by a pilot turning the heading knob toward that exact place, a process that would require some piloting expertise. This would be very unusual, and a novice or pilot without much flying experience on this plane would not know to make these kinds of inputs or have any conceivable reason to do so. The almost certain explanation would be that these waypoints were programmed into the flight management system of the 777-200, a task that would have been beyond the abilities of anyone but a professional pilot. The autopilot follows the course put into the flight management system by the pilots. That is, when the autopilot is not being manually controlled instead. The manual control part is easy. You turn a knob and the airplane goes where you ask it to. The flight management system part is very complicated. I am a commercial pilot, and I have done some training on the Boeing 777. Even after a few hours of professional instruction I would have been unable to program the flight management system to command the autopilot to fly the flight plan that Flight 370 reportedly flew. This leaves us with one of two possible conclusions. Either the flight was commandeered by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot among them or one of the pilots in control programmed the new off-route flight plan into the flight management system. The latter would be far more likely. When terrorists hijacked the airplanes that were flown into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, they flew the airplanes by hand and those hijackers had trained for months with that exact mission in mind. In the case of Flight 370, it would almost certainly have remained on autopilot, which would have dutifully followed the flight plan in the flight management system. That flight plan was quite possibly entered for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Goyer.","Robert Goyer: New clues suggest that Flight 370 didn't change course randomly .

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, who embodied a vanishing breed of liberal Republicanism before switching to the Democratic Party at the twilight of his political career, died Sunday after a long battle with cancer, his family announced. Specter died of complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at his home in Philadelphia, his family said. He was 82. The veteran Pennsylvania politician had overcome numerous serious illnesses over the past two decades, including a brain tumor. He had been in the public eye since serving as a member of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Specter was elected to the Senate in 1980 and represented Pennsylvania for 30 years, longer than anyone in the state's history. His politically moderate image fit hand-in-glove in the politically blue Northeast, both with its Democratic centrists and its liberal Republicans. He was also one of America's most prominent Jewish politicians, a rare Republican in a category dominated by Democrats over the decades. And his name is synonymous with Pennsylvania, an idiosyncratic state that pushes and pulls between the two parties, and his home, the staunchly Democratic city of Philadelphia. In 2006, Philadelphia magazine called him ""one of the few true wild cards of Washington politics ... reviled by those on both the right and the left."" ""Charming and churlish, brilliant and pedantic, he can be fiercely independent, entertainingly eccentric and simply maddening,"" the profile read. Former Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, called Specter ""a mentor, colleague and a political institution"" who ""did more for the people of Pennsylvania over his more than 30-year career with the possible exception of Benjamin Franklin."" And Pat Toomey, the Republican who now holds Specter's old Senate seat, praised him as ""a man of sharp intelligence and dogged determination."" And at the White House, President Barack Obama said Specter ""was always a fighter."" ""From his days stamping out corruption as a prosecutor in Philadelphia to his three decades of service in the Senate, Arlen was fiercely independent -- never putting party or ideology ahead of the people he was chosen to serve,"" Obama said in a written statement on Specter's death. And Vice President Joe Biden lamented the loss of ""my friend,"" ""who never walked away from his principles and was at his best when they were challenged."" Biden will travel to Penn Valley, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday for Specter's funeral, according to the White House. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll and professor of pubic affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, said Frank Sinatra's song ""My Way"" could apply to Specter. ""There isn't any doubt in many respects he was an unusual politician,"" Madonna said. ""He didn't look at polls. He didn't track how his comments were playing out in the press. ... ""He was fundamentally a pragmatist who could bend with the times,"" Madonna said, and he believed greatly that government could help people. ""The Republicanism in his day, it was a different kind of Republican. He was a Philadelphian, and not into that staunchly conservative Republicanism that we see"" today. Readers wished the best for Specter . Madonna called Specter an ""indefatigable"" public figure, highly demanding of both himself and those who worked for him over the years. He had a few election losses but he was undeterred by defeat, the prospects of losing and the challenges he faced. ""The last thing you would have thought about Arlen Specter was that he was born in Kansas,"" Madonna said. ""He always came across as kind of urbane. He had a kind of caustic sense of humor."" But Specter in fact was born in Wichita, the youngest child of Lillie Shanin and Harry Specter, an immigrant from Ukraine. He grew up in Russell, Kansas, also the hometown of another Republican icon, a one-time presidential nominee and senator, Bob Dole. After graduating from Russell High School in 1947, Specter first went to the University of Oklahoma. But he eventually went east for his higher education. He earned a bachelor's degree in international relations in 1951 from the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa. He was in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War from 1951 to 1953, serving as a second lieutenant in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. He returned to his studies and graduated from Yale Law School in 1956. After Yale, he started practicing law and became an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia. He served on the Warren Commission at the recommendation of Rep. Gerald Ford, later president. Specter is credited with co-authoring the ""single bullet theory,"" which suggested that some of the wounds to Kennedy and then-Texas Gov. John Connally were caused by the same bullet. Even though he was a registered Democrat, Specter ran successfully for Philadelphia district attorney on the Republican ticket in 1965 and eventually registered as a Republican. He lost an election for Philadelphia mayor in 1967. He served as district attorney until 1974 and prosecuted corruption cases against Philadelphia magistrates and Teamsters. Specter ran for the U.S. Senate in 1976, but he was defeated in the Republican primary by John Heinz. He ran for governor but was defeated by Dick Thornburgh in the primary. But he won his bid for Senate in 1980 and distinguished himself, serving until 2011. ""During his tenure in the Senate, Specter championed Pennsylvania's economy and took an active interest in foreign affairs, meeting with dozens of world leaders as well as supporting appropriations to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic and backing free trade agreements between the U.S. and under-developed countries,"" according to a bio from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He served on the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he was chairman from 2005 to 2007. He served as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1995 to 1997. And he was a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Specter brought more financial resources to Pennsylvania than anyone in the state, working with mayors and other local leaders to help them get grants and aid, Madonna said. And he's remembered across the state's 67 counties for his efforts. ""He didn't shy away from pork,"" Madonna said. He participated in the confirmation hearings of 14 U.S. Supreme Court nominees, the Penn bio says. He is remembered for leading the charge against conservative nominee Robert Bork and going after Anita Hill, who accused nominee Clarence Thomas of harassment. ""No member of Congress shaped the Supreme Court more than he did,"" Madonna said. ""He had a prosecutorial mindset. He could be incredibly persuasive as an interrogator."" Specter straddled right and left. He criticized Republicans for President Bill Clinton's impeachment and voted in favor of the Iraq war. He supported embryonic stem cell research. During the 1990s, he briefly announced a run for president but eventually dropped the effort and endorsed Bob Dole. Despite his longtime membership in the Republican Party, Specter became more alienated from the party as it grew more conservative. Like many of his moderate compatriots, he came to be viewed by the new conservatives as a RINO -- a Republican in Name Only. Decades after he switched to the Republican Party, he changed his stripes again. He became a Democrat in 2009, saying Republicans had moved too far to the right and embraced social conservatism. The move gave Democrats a 60-seat filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But in 2010, when he ran for re-election, Specter lost the Democratic primary to Rep. Joe Sestak. Sestak, who went on to lose the race to Toomey, praised Specter via Twitter as ""a warrior of inestimable public service."" After the loss, Specter moved from the halls of Congress to those of academia, taking on a new role at the University of Pennsylvania Law School as an adjunct professor. ""Arlen's knowledge of the inner workings of the government and lawmaking is second to none,"" said Michael Fitts, the law school's dean. ""The insight he brings from his career in public service, particularly as a leader on judicial issues, will be invaluable to our students as they prepare for their own careers in the law."" The senator practiced law when he wasn't in office and authored books throughout his career, including: . -- ""Passion for Truth: From Finding JFK's Single Bullet to Questioning Anita Hill to Impeaching Clinton"" -- ""Never Give In: Battling Cancer in the Senate"" -- ""Life Among the Cannibals: A Political Career, a Tea Party Uprising, and the End of Governing As We Know It"" ""For the past quarter-century, he's also been a Zelig-like national figure,"" the Philadelphia magazine article said, referring to the Woody Allen character from the film of the same name who changed his persona as his surroundings and circumstances changed. ""From his role in sinking Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination to his cross-examination of Anita Hill, from stem-cell research to the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Specter's greatest talent may be his unique ability to put himself -- somehow, some way -- in the center of the nation's most important debates,"" the article said.

"(CNN) -- Since the debut of ""Mad Men,"" some have called me ""The Real Mad Man,"" with Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm) thought of as my alter ego. But ""Mad Men"" misrepresents the advertising industry of my time by ignoring the dynamics of the Creative Revolution that changed the world of communications forever. From where I sit, claiming this exasperating show is even remotely representative of the times we lived through would be like trying to show ""Dynasty"" on the History Channel! ""Mad Men"" is nothing more than the fulfillment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters -- with one-night-stands and excessive consumption of Cutty Sark and Lucky Strikes -- is glamorous and ""vintage."" It was not like that. That dynamic period of counterculture in the 1960s found expression on Madison Avenue through a new creative generation -- a rebellious coterie of art directors and copywriters who understood that visual and verbal expression were indivisible, who bridled under the old rules that consigned them to secondary roles in the ad-making process dominated by noncreative hacks and technocrats. In the very first week of the 1960s, after a successful year as an award-winning art director at the legendary Doyle Dane Bernbach, I left. And with two copywriters as partners, started what was unthinkable at the time, the first ad agency to have the name of an art director in its masthead, and later, the first to go public. It was a testy time to be a graphic designer like me who had the rage to communicate and, to create icon rather than con. And, unlike the TV ""Mad Men,"" we worked full, exhausting, joyous days: pitching new business, creating ideas, ""comping"" them up, storyboarding them, selling them, photographing them, and directing commercials. And our only ""extracurricular activity"" was chasing fly balls and dunking basketballs on our agency softball and basketball teams! The instant success of our trailblazing firm inspired a handful of other creative groups to form agencies and join our passionate revolution as we created advertising and imagery that caught people's eyes, penetrated their minds, warmed their hearts, and caused them to act -- raising the bar of mass communication throughout the world. Of course the producers of ""Mad Men"" are making TV drama and not documentary. For the record, please know that I, and the other real Mad Men, bear no resemblance to their lineup of talentless hacks who carouse the halls of the fictitious Sterling Cooper ad agency.

"(CNN) -- Bret Michaels' ""sheer will to live"" kept him alive long enough last week to allow doctors to stabilize his condition after he suffered a massive brain hemorrhage, his neurosurgeon said Friday. The rock singer and reality TV star was in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, a week after he suffered the rupture. His sister Michael Sychak told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that Michaels was watching television at his home near Phoenix when he was stricken by an excruciating headache on the evening of April 22. ""Bret's fight to stay conscious during the hemorrhage and get to the emergency room"" was key to saving his life that night, said Dr. Joseph Zabramski, the head of the medical team treating Michaels. ""He has an unbelievable fight in him and told me what kept him alive at the moment of the hemorrhage was that he 'did not want his family to wake up and see him lying unconscious in the middle of the floor,' "" Zabramski said. His recovery is complicated by ""a few roadblocks,"" he said. Michaels has hyponatremia, a lack of sodium in the body, which leads to seizures. He also suffers severe cranial and back pain from blood drainage, he said. An emergency appendectomy 11 days before the rupture, and his lifelong history of Type 1 diabetes are also factors slowing the recovery, he said. ""Bret's sheer will to live and fully recover is undeniable,"" the doctor said. Zabramski and his team will talk more about Michaels' illness and recovery at a news conference at the hospital on Tuesday. Michaels is able to talk, his sister said. ""He sounded good -- as good as you can when your brain's throbbing,"" she said. A statement published on Michaels' official website earlier in the week said his band might resume its concert tour as soon as May 26 ""provided there are no further complications."" Michaels, 47, was the lead singer for the '80s glam-metal ""hair band"" Poison. He became a reality star on the VH1 show ""Rock of Love with Bret Michaels."" He has also appeared on ""Celebrity Apprentice.""","Michaels fought to stay conscious during brain hemorrhage .

"Paris (CNN) -- The ship carrying the remains of victims and wreckage from the Rio-Paris Air France 447 crash arrived in France on Thursday morning with around 104 bodies on board, according to French police sources. A French police spokesman said ""it is very difficult to give an exact number of bodies, but we believe there to be around 104."" AF 447 crashed two years ago close to the coast of Brazil, killing all on board. The Ile-de-Sein, the cable ship chartered by French investigation body the BEA, docked at the port of Bayonne for unloading. All access to the port was blocked by police for the sake of discretion for the families of the victims. Dr. Bernd Gans, father of a German victim, said, ""They showed us pictures of freezing containers, saying this is how the remains were transported. I think it's right that the families were not present at the port today."" Once the unloading procedure has been completed, the remains will be sent to the forensic institute in Paris for autopsy and identification. Debris from the aircraft will be sent to a hangar in Toulouse for technical analysis. Colonel Francois Daoust, head of the Institute of Criminal Research of French National police told French press that identification would be made in two stages, ante mortem and post mortem, through the use of medical records, dental records, comparison with DNA of relatives, and identification of jewellery. He also described the state of the bodies: ""These bodies have been damaged by the shock of the crash. And then nature does the job, obviously. The temperature at 2-3 ° and the almost total lack of oxygen slowed the deterioration process, but after two years, the bodies are inevitably damaged."" Gans told CNN that he had been in Paris Wednesday with other victim's families. ""They explained to us that they would start identifying the remains recovered in contrast to what we were told a couple of weeks ago that the bodies could be identified by photos or clothes,"" he said. ""It turns out it's really just a case of remains being identified by DNA. We are afraid that not much remains. ""When we were first told that the bodies could be identified by looking at them I thought... It's brilliant. With the way thing are now, I have changed my mind. They died all together at this particular spot and we should have left them there."" No exact time frame has been given for the process. Daoust told French media, ""It will take time. To give you an idea, identifying the first 50 bodies, two years ago, had taken two months of work. For 104 new bodies, up to 40 people will be mobilized for several weeks."" Gans described the reaction of two French victims' relatives at the meeting held for victims relatives. ""They were very emotional at this point. They asked if it could be arranged for all the relatives to get the results at the same time, so that some wouldn't be waiting whilst others had results. This was denied by representatives. They said this is the order we have for the investigation. When we have results we have to contact families,"" he said. ""The victims' families will just have to sit and wait. This was very painful to hear."" Operations onboard the Ile-de-Sein came to an end on June 3. A total of 154 bodies have now been brought up, however this still leaves more than 70 which will never be recovered. Gans explained, ""Difficult days begin now. Some families will have hope; will be in this situation of waiting for the next months. Some will have an answer while others will never know.""","Ship transporting remains and wreckage arrives in France .

"(CNN) -- With the news of a video showing their son Bowe Bergdahl is alive, his family sent out a statement they hoped his captors would let him see. Stay strong, be patient, it said. It's been more than four tormenting years since he was taken captive while serving in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and there again are concerns about his well-being. The so-called proof-of-life video that was provided to the U.S. military is the first of him in nearly three years. It has a reference to December 14, 2013. CNN has not seen the video, but a U.S. military official told the network that the clip apparently shows the Idaho native in diminished health. That's a picture that's hard to envision for family and friends. For them, strong has been a word often associated with Bergdahl. In June 2009, after he was taken, CNN spoke to friends of his, including a fishing boat captain who hired Bergdahl two years earlier. Bergdahl spent 10 weeks on the vessel near Bristol Bay, Alaska, pulling in sockeye salmon for 18 to 20 hours a day. Dan Collins said it was hard, grueling work. ""But he was up to it,"" Collins said. ""I am at times not the easiest guy to get along with, being a fishing boat's captain. But I imagine I am easy compared to what he is dealing with every day now."" Now Bergdahl, 27, is believed to held by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Pakistan, the U.S. military official said. Bergdahl has been in captivity so long he has been promoted twice and is now a sergeant. In Hailey, Idaho, many residents still have yellow ribbons around trees. It was there four years ago that Sue Martin, owner of Zaney's Coffee Shop spoke glowingly of her former barista. ""Bowe is not somebody in the corner,"" she said. ""You engage, and he engages very well."" ""He captures you,"" Martin said. Bergdahl was a well-rounded, well-grounded young man, people told CNN. He was a seeker, a hard worker, a man raised and home-schooled in a small town, an avid outdoorsman who did ballet. He could talk to anyone. He toured Europe before joining the Army. He also didn't care for cars, choosing to ride a bicycle to and from the odd jobs he worked to pay for his travels, friends said. And he was polite, very polite. One rainy evening the sheriff in his Idaho community stopped to offer him a ride. Bergdahl, who was drenched and walking his bike, said he wouldn't want to get the car wet, so no thanks. And he kept walking. ""Kind of tells you a little bit about the person,"" recalled Walt Femling, who knew Bergdahl through renting him an apartment the sheriff owned. ""I don't usually rent to 20-year-olds,"" Femling said. He trusted Bergdahl. ""There's not many young people who have the kind manners he has,"" said neighbor Minna Casser. ""He's a gentleman and a sportsman."" The Bergdahl family hasn't spoken much publicly about their son. His father, Robert Bergdahl, posted a YouTube video in May 2011 and a year later he spoke at a Memorial Day event in Washington that was attended by more than 100,000 people. ""Bowe, your family has not forgotten you, your hometown has not forgotten you. Your state of Idaho has not forgotten you, and thanks to all of you here today, Washington D.C. has not forgotten you,"" Robert Bergdahl told a cheering crowd. ""We love you, we are proud of you. Stay strong, never give up. We pray for the day that we welcome you home,"" he said. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Paul Vercammen, Ashley Fantz and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Bowe Bergdahl grew up in Idaho, was home schooled .

"(CNN) -- ""It's the hour for us in this country to turn it back toward the Lord. We're much more than 'hallelujah' people. We're into government, and we are into politics. We are a force to be reckoned with."" Wilfredo De Jesus wants his message heard loud and clear: Evangelical Latino Protestants in the United States are more relevant than ever. And they're up for grabs ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. One of the leading voices of the fast-growing evangelical Protestant Latino voting bloc, in the past 14 years as the senior pastor of New Life Covenant Ministries in Chicago, De Jesus has seen the church grow from ""68 people in one of the worst parts of the nation to over 20,000."" Last year, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. ""We're very vocal now,"" he said. ""In the last 10 years, you've seen this bloc of people has grown. And we have tremendous influence. Especially in politics."" A new study by a nonpartisan research institute based in Washington suggests that he's right. The 2013 Hispanic Values Survey released recently by the Public Religion Research Institute showed a sharp shift in religious demographics among Latinos. It's that complex religious divide that could be the key to the Republican Party making inroads in the community during the next election cycle. ""The number of evangelical Protestants nearly doubled from 7% to 13% when you compare childhood religious affiliation to current religious affiliation,"" said the institute's Chief Executive Officer, Robert P. Jones. That's between 7.5 million and 8 million ""quintessential swing voters."" An 'affinity for the Republican Party' The door is the most open to Republican candidates and the Republican Party, Jones said. ""Evangelicals have the most affinity for the Republican Party. While nearly half lean towards the Democratic Party, almost as many lean towards the Republican Party at 43%."" The findings were taken from a random sample survey of 1,563 respondents who identified as Hispanic living in the U.S. De Jesus -- or ""Pastor Choco,"" as he is more commonly known -- believes that evangelical Protestants are ""what the country needs right now"" and could be the key not only for the GOP winning big during the midterms, but also for Republicans to get back to the White House. ""We've learned from the Bible that when the righteous govern, the people rejoice. And (Latinos) haven't seen our people rejoice for quite some time,"" he said. ""At the core of evangelicals is the fear of God and the institution of family. These are things we feel we can bring back to this nation."" 'We need to do a better job communicating' Latino evangelicals might be ripe for Republican influence, but getting them to vote red is a different story. Angel Garcia, president of the Chicago Young Republicans, said that although the survey gives the GOP reason to be hopeful, the party needs to be more proactive within the community. ""We've done a bad job of managing our brand. We've let a handful of people in our party, that have made some unfortunate statements, control the party's message,"" Garcia said. The 38-year-old attorney and lifelong Republican said that as the son of Mexican immigrants, ""it's disappointing as a Latino when you hear people making ignorant statements (in the party). But both sides make ignorant statements. I am a leader in the party. I have lived the Latino culture. It's my job to show the voters and pretty much the entire party that we need to do a better job communicating."" He's talking about statements like this one by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, describing his plan to deal with undocumented immigrants during a 2012 primary debate: ""The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can't find work here because they don't have legal documentation to allow them to work here."" ""When he said that, I looked over at my wife and said, 'He just lost thousands, if not millions, of us.' Immigration ... it's a preeminent issue for us,"" said the Rev. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. A focus on immigration reform . Much like his friend De Jesus, Salguero believes that Latino evangelicals are the key to victory for any politician. Nowhere is this more evident than on the issue of immigration reform. ""Evangelicals are coming to a boiling point on this issue. We've prayed about this, held meetings with the White House; we've done all we can,"" he said from Newark, New Jersey. ""Let me be clear: We face the issue of immigration every day, as pastors, as caretakers, as Latinos. This is on the top of our political agenda. It would be disingenuous of me to say it doesn't carry heavy electoral gravitas."" Both Salguero and De Jesus were advisers to President Barack Obama on the immigration issue. It's an area where they feel he's failed. Republicans have the chance to capitalize on it, according to De Jesus. ""Barack flipped on us,"" De Jesus said. ""I traveled for Obama for 14 months as a surrogate. I talked to the White House, and I said, 'the president cannot speak from both sides of his mouth.' It's only right for the Republicans to say, 'let's win back this Latino bloc, at least the evangelicals.' That starts with the immigration issue."" The dismal Latino turnout for Romney was a stark contrast to the momentum developed for years under President George W. Bush, who won 44% of the Latino vote in 2004, compared with the 27% Romney received eight years later. After the 2012 election, the GOP held a postmortem emphasizing Hispanic outreach, but it's still unclear how much of a priority Republicans have made Latino voters. At the latest Conservative Political Action Conference, a panel on minority outreach had dismally low attendance. Disapproval of both parties . The Hispanic Values Survey showed that while there is ""dissatisfaction"" among Latino voters with the Democratic Party on issues like record deportation numbers under Obama, there is ""distrust"" of the Republican Party within the Latino community. ""The Democratic Party has a less bumpy road ahead,"" Jones said. ""The clearest word of caution to Democrats ... one phrase that is a bellwether question of how well to gauge voters is, 'How well does the party care about people like you?' "" Nearly three in 10, or 29%, said ""neither party cares about them,"" according to the survey. ""Democrats certainly don't have this community locked down. That's a pretty clear indication that there's significant dissatisfaction among Latinos with both parties,"" Jones said. ""That's not necessarily a reason for us to be optimistic. We have to be realistic and more proactive,"" said Daniel Ballori, president of the Young Republican Federation of Puerto Rico. The 31-year-old said the focus for the Republicans in winning more Latino votes should be on the economy, whether they are courting evangelical Protestants or others in the community. ""Jobs and unemployment. The figures show that U.S.-born Latinos care about the same issues that non-Latino Anglos care about. Right now, that's jobs and unemployment,"" Ballori said. He may be on to something. Though the issue of immigration reform was ranked high among the concerns of Latino voters, it was in a four-way tie for the third most important issue behind the economy and affordable health care, according to Public Religion Research Institute research. Garcia said the solution to courting more Latino voters comes down to the rhetoric. ""Regardless of party, Hispanics will go to the candidate that supports them. We're the party of (Marco) Rubio, (Brian) Sandoval and (Susana) Martinez. Our message should be one of inclusion,"" Garcia said. The question then becomes, how do they do that? ""These politicians are so full of it to get elected,"" De Jesus said. ""Give us someone who is real and speaks the truth and is going to do what they say and mean it. We'll vote for them, whatever party they're from.""","New survey shows number of Latino evangelical Protestants is on the rise .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- During a meeting with historians in 2011, Politico reported, President Obama said: ""What you could do for me is to help me find a way to discuss the issue of inequality in our society without being accused of class warfare."" For Obama, this is not an esoteric question. Rather, this is a challenge that will be integral to his campaign and, if he is re-elected, to his second term as president. Many Democrats have argued that Obama should have tackled this issue from his first day in the White House. But this is an issue the president didn't think he had the political capital to address. He has also continually feared that touching on inequality would open him up to Republican attacks of being left of center. Obama's question to the historians has no easy answer. When Democratic presidents have tackled issues of inequality, they have usually come under intense attack. That is the cost of trying to address this problem through government. (Republicans argue this is best left to the marketplace.) The key to success has been how strong the Democrats' responses to the critics have been. Two Democratic presidents who tackled the problem of inequality in the 20th century in very different times were Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. In 1932, FDR took office at the height of the Great Depression, with 25% of the workforce unemployed. He argued that the federal government would have to help take care of those who were suffering. FDR promoted policies that aimed to provide greater economic security to working and middle-class Americans. Many of his key policies -- such as public works, Social Security, and the right to join a union -- aimed to make certain that the bottom did not fall out for those who were not rich and that average Americans had a strong foundation to climb up the income ladder once the Depression ended. The business community responded predictably. While some leaders in the corporate world accepted the need for a New Deal, many others did not. The American Liberty League, an organization founded by business leaders in 1934, attacked FDR for trying to stoke class conflict and dividing Americans for his own political objectives. Following his combative State of the Union message in January 1936, when Roosevelt declared that his administration had ""earned the hatred of entrenched greed,"" the American Liberty League denounced his effort to pit ""class against class."" Roosevelt didn't run away. He insisted that the government had a duty to strengthen those who were disadvantaged. He also embraced the argument that if middle-class Americans prospered, they would spend money in consumer markets, which would in turn help the whole economy. Finally, at some moments he argued that the nation suffered when the wealthy accumulated excessive economic and political power. In a 1936 campaign speech, FDR said: ""We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace -- business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. ... Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred."" Lyndon Johnson was more timid in certain respects. Johnson rarely spoke about the obligations of the rich, nor did he push for any kinds of tax increases until later in his presidency. But he was willing to deal with the suffering of those who were not sharing in the prosperity of the era. He argued that a nation as great as the United States could not simply let inequality persist. The centerpiece of his earlier years was the War on Poverty. In his State of the Union address in January 1964, Johnson said: ""Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope -- some because of their poverty, and some because of their color, and all too many because of both. Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity. This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. ... The richest nation on earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it."" Republicans did not sit by quietly. They attacked him for distributing funds to groups they called radical organizations and spending government money on urban populations. In 1964, Republican candidate Barry Goldwater said the War on Poverty was an attempt to ""divide Americans."" Johnson responded that his anti-poverty programs would in fact help the poor become self-sufficient and give them the tools to be good citizens. It has become more difficult for Democratic presidents to discuss inequality for three reasons. The first is the rise of the conservative movement, the mobilization of right-wing politicians, activists, and organizations who shifted political debate to the right. Certain questions, such as the role of government in diminishing inequality, became politically explosive. The second reason is the particular state of the economy. During the 1930s, the state of the economic downturn was so severe that business and the wealthy had their backs to the wall, and progressive discussions about inequality received greater support. During the 1960s, the era of economic growth created the impression that the economic pie could continue to expand so that everyone could enjoy the rewards of the expanding GNP. Currently, the economy is stagnant, yet conditions are not as severe as in the 1930s. As a result, discussions of inequality are still politically risky at the same time that they appear to require a zero-sum game where, to ease inequality, one side would have to lose in order for the other to gain. Finally, the campaign system is flooded with private money, with both presidential candidates taking enormous contributions from wealthy interests who have little appetite for policies that would seriously diminish economic inequality, such as strengthening the progressive tax system. As a result, there is strong counter-pressure against any politician, Democrat or Republican, who is thinking of taking this step. Regardless of these changes, a vibrant national discussion about inequality, with the president taking the lead, is essential. The 2012 campaign offers Obama an opportunity to put this problem on the national agenda. The challenge for Obama is that there really is no way around the inevitable attacks, and there is no way to talk about economic inequality other than talking about it. Rather than looking for rhetorical tricks, Obama should instead focus on having the best arguments in response to the conservative attacks. This will require borrowing from Roosevelt a defense of how a vibrant middle class will be crucial to revitalizing America's economic position in the world, and from Johnson an argument that the ethical obligation to help the poorest is incumbent on our democracy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","President Obama reportedly asked historians for defense vs. 'class warfare' attacks .

"(CNN) -- The mysterious burst of light in the sky and loud booms witnessed Sunday night by residents along the Mid-Atlantic coastline was likely caused by a Russian rocket booster re-entering the atmosphere, said an official at the U.S. Naval Observatory. A mysterious flash in the sky Sunday night may have been debris from the Soyuz spacecraft's booster. The exact cause of the flash that caused hundreds of people  to call the media, local authorities and the National Weather Service was still unknown Monday afternoon. But eyewitness accounts of the color, shape and timing of the light and sound had officials at the Naval Observatory confident of the phenomenon's cause: the re-entry of orbiting space junk from the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that blasted off last week from Kazakhstan. ""An object like this will have a pretty spectacular display when it enters the atmosphere,"" said U.S. Naval Observatory spokesman Geoff Chester. Monday morning after the incident, Chester said he traced the rocket booster's path and found it was hovering over Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, around the time people reported seeing the light. iReport.com: Did you see the mysterious flash? Sunday's mysterious flash and booms also could have been a fireball, a natural phenomenon that occurs when a rock about the size of a suitcase slams into the earth. Naval Observatory officials say that scenario is unlikely in this case, since the space junk was already orbiting in the area. Chester said the yellow, orange and iridescent green flashes reported by witnesses resemble both fireballs and burning space junk. ""The visual reports are consistent with either case,"" he said. ""But the fact that a Russian rocket booster was passing through that area of the sky at the same time, it's a pretty strong factor in my opinion to make that the culprit."" The timing of the light and sounds also indicates it was likely space debris. Chester said it usually takes up to a week for a rocket booster's orbit to decay. The Russian spaceship was launched last Thursday. The booming sounds were likely noises from the explosion, he said. There are no reports of damage, weather officials say. Fragments of the object likely landed in the Atlantic Ocean. The likelihood of space debris hitting one's home is pretty remote, Chester said, so residents don't have to worry. The light and sounds, which shook houses, occurred between 9:30 and 9:45 p.m. and could be seen and heard from southern Maryland to North Carolina, said Jeff Lewitsky, a forecaster for the National Weather Service Forecast office in Wakefield, Virginia. After receiving dozens of inquiries on Sunday night from concerned citizens, Lewitsky and his team analyzed the radar and satellite loops and determined the phenomenon wasn't caused by weather. Lewitsky said his office has not had residents report such a sighting in the past 20 years. Officials have ruled out another possibility: The light was not likely a solar wind or flare, which is a burst of energy that travels from the sun, said a spokeswoman for the Space Weather Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","Naval Observatory traced path of Russian rocket booster at time of witness reports .

"(CNN) -- A strong, politically savvy woman is just what Japan and the United States need to strengthen relations on both sides of the Pacific. Caroline Kennedy, who is in line for the post of U.S. ambassador to Japan, may or may not exactly fit that bill. With any luck, though, she could leverage her appointment as Washington's top envoy to Tokyo to heighten awareness of just how seriously both sides need to take the issue of female leadership. Not that there is a dearth of other pressing problems at stake. North Korea's nuclear aspirations show no sign of abating, while worries about tensions in the East China Sea over a handful of barren rocks possibly triggering armed conflict between Japan and China persist. Meanwhile, an arms race is building up in the Asia-Pacific, and the United States needs to strengthen ties with solid allies such as Japan more than ever. A skillful diplomat should be able to navigate those choppy waters under the leadership of the Obama administration. Where an ambassador can make a real difference in bilateral relations is in highlighting issues that are not necessarily being pushed forward by her bosses at the State Department. For Kennedy, her cause should rightly be unleashing the power of women in Japan and the United States. Japan is woefully behind most other industrialized countries -- and developing nations alike. According to the World Economic Forum's 2012 gender equity survey, it ranks in 101st place among 135 countries. The United States, meanwhile, comes in as number 22, and European countries dominate the top tier of the ranking that measures women's economic opportunities, education, health and political empowerment. More than 60% of Japanese women work, while nearly 70% of their U.S. counterparts are in the workforce. What's particularly worrisome, though, is that while women make up about 15% of upper management and company boards in the United States, they account for about 2% in Japan, according to the consultancy group McKinsey's June 2012 report Women Matter: An Asian Perspective. That means the United States is hardly a role model when it comes to female leadership, and both Japan and the United States can encourage one another to go beyond simply discussing women joining the workforce. What both countries need now is to ensure greater diversity in leadership positions, from the corridors of power to executive board rooms. Certainly in Japan, women are as well-educated as men, but face major obstacles in climbing up the corporate ladder once they get married or after they have children. Not only does Japan need major policy overhaul to encourage more women to be more ambitious professionally, but there also needs to be a significant shift in mindset to convince women that they can and should strive for economic empowerment. At 1.39 children per women, Japan's birthrate is one of the lowest in the world. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of the population is older than 65, while the number of immigrants in the country remains below 2%, according to the International Organization for Migration. Clearly, that equation does not make for a robust economy. Pushing for the best and brightest women to be more ambitious, and giving them the opportunity to shine, should be a national priority. The United States is ahead of Japan when it comes to acknowledging the potential of female corporate and political leaders, but it pales in comparison to Scandinavian countries. Both the United States and Japan have a long way to go to reach gender parity, and both can work together to change the mindset toward female leadership. As John F. Kennedy's only daughter, Caroline Kennedy's personal experiences hardly resonate with the average woman. Yet she has enjoyed access to some of the world's most powerful and inspiring people since an early age, and she can leverage her position as ambassador to highlight what women in Japan and the United States can aspire. Kennedy could encourage high-powered women such as Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to spread a U.S. brand of self-made powerful women who have prospered in places such as Silicon Valley. She could reach out to people such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to talk about her personal struggles in juggling personal ambition and family needs, which will resonate with all women regardless of nationality or economic status. Kennedy's biggest personal challenge would be to come out of her father's shadow and establish herself as a top diplomat in her own right. Her posting to one of the potentially most explosive regions in the world today highlights Obama's confidence in her leadership potential. Japan has a very long way to go to for gender equality. The United States does much better, but it could do more as well. Both countries can acknowledge that there is a problem and be open to learning from nations that have encouraged female leadership and success to blossom. Given Kennedy's high profile, she could shed light on the issue and push for concrete action. And by being humble and acknowledging America's failings in promoting women to leadership positions, Kennedy would avoid the label of trying to impose U.S. values on her host country. By becoming a champion of female leadership in Japan and the United States, Kennedy could leave a powerful legacy of helping to enhance U.S.-Japan relations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shihoko Goto.","Caroline Kennedy is being vetted for the post of U.S. ambassador to Japan .

"(CNN) -- Okay, so Alec Baldwin isn't the world's most sympathetic character. He throws tantrums, smacks the occasional photographer and was once caught on tape calling his preteen daughter a ""thoughtless little pig."" But he's still right to vent his spleen at the New York Post. ""Everyone who breathes air knows the Post is the worst newspaper in human history,"" Baldwin declared on Twitter. Well, human history might be going a bit far. Baldwin was responding to caustic columnist Andrea Peyser, who called him a ""bloviating psycho."" Rupert Murdoch's paper has obviously taken great delight in targeting the liberal actor. But there's a larger issue here than just another tantalizing tabloid feud. Baldwin has allegedly been pursued by a stalker, which is no laughing matter. And he has mounted something of a crusade against the stalking photographers known as the paparazzi. So when you strip away the name-calling, as entertaining as that is, this is a debate about the price of celebrity and the limits of privacy. Watch: Did Rupert Murdoch Skate in British Report on Phone Hacking? Here's the back story. Baldwin, the star of ""30 Rock,"" has allegedly been harassed by a Canadian actress named Genevieve Sabourin. She claims they had a sexual encounter, what the Post calls a ""sweaty night of passion,"" in 2010, and that they maintained an online romantic relationship for months. (Baldwin says they only had dinner.) Sabourin was arrested in April after showing up at Baldwin's Greenwich Village apartment building, according to news reports. She has also allegedly appeared at a Lincoln Center screening where the actor was speaking, hung around his Hamptons retreat and sent him dozens of e-mails, the New York Daily News reported. One had the subject heading ""Defcon 1,"" according to an affidavit signed by Baldwin, ABC news reported, and said if he didn't talk to Sabourin that she would start a war against him. Watch: Are TV Newsbabes Dressing Sexy for Ratings? Sabourin was arrested again last week for violating a court order by allegedly aiming a series of tweets at Baldwin and his wife, Hilaria, the 28-year-old yoga instructor he married last spring. Apparently you can just as easily harass someone online as in person. The woman described by her lawyer as ""starstruck"" was released from jail after a judge rejected a prosecution request for $5,000 bail. Sabourin is fighting the charges. Watch: Media Embrace Cop Who Bought Boots for Homeless Man . So even if Baldwin is no Jack Donaghy, the suave TV executive he plays on NBC, does he deserve this? Does being famous mean the privacy laws somehow don't apply to you? Baldwin is hardly immune from ridicule, but he's entitled to the same legal protection as an ordinary Joe. The Post's Peyser, who can be bitingly funny, has chosen to launch a crusade on Genevieve Sabourin's behalf. Last April she wrote, obviously tongue in cheek, of her own ""cracked and perverse relationship"" with Baldwin, driven by her ""all-out and disturbingly weird and committed obsession"" with the actor. He got personal as well, tweeting, ""Andrea Peyser, you are as bad a writer as you are filled with self-hatred."" Watch: Why a Video of a Botched Butt Implant Went Viral . Peyser now writes that ""the blubberous Baldwin"" should drop the charges. Baldwin says the matter is out of his hands, now that the district attorney has brought charges. As for the New York Post, Baldwin tweeted, ""Shame on them for politicizing a criminal case ... and shame on the morally bankrupt partisan trash Andrea Peyser, who demeans all women by inferring that a charge of criminal harassment is overkill when the defendant is a woman. The 'lovesick' defense."" Baldwin's spokesman Matthew Hiltzik confirmed the series of tweets, which the actor later took down, but declined further comment. I don't mind Peyser using Baldwin as her personal piÃ±ata; she's in the columnizing business, and he's certainly fair game. But there is a mindset in which the press feels free to trample on the rights of celebrities, as when Murdoch's London tabloid News of the World mercilessly hacked the phones of British stars. The legal system is doing fine in dealing with Alec Baldwin's alleged stalker. But some in the media seem to be stalking Baldwin as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: New York Post has been afflicting Alec Baldwin, who is correct to vent spleen .

"(CNN) -- I went out on a limb the other day and said David Gregory should not be behind bars. You would think I had issued a declaration of war. And maybe, the way some folks look at it, I had. My defense of the ""Meet the Press"" moderator followed the much-publicized spectacle in which he brandished on the air a high-capacity magazine during an interview with the National Rifle Association's chief executive. This was, to be sure, something of a stunt. It made for a great visual. It gave Gregory a prop as he asked Wayne LaPierre whether, if 30-bullet magazines like the one in his hand were banned, ""isn't it just possible that we could reduce the carnage in a situation like Newtown?"" Next, as you've probably heard, came word that the police department in Washington was investigating Gregory for a potential violation of the city's gun laws. Possession of high-capacity magazines is illegal in Washington, even if they are empty. It didn't help matters when the police said that NBC had asked for permission to show the ammunition on the air and was turned down. Nor has NBC's silence on the matter aided Gregory's case. Watch: Is Chelsea Clinton a 'pretend journalist' for NBC? But let's get real here. David Gregory's only intent was to commit journalism. Why are the cops wasting time on this, other than as a PR gesture to demonstrate that they're somehow on the case? It's fine to lambaste what Gregory did on the air. He walked right up to the line, and some would say crossed it, of pushing LaPierre to acknowledge that some form of gun control would be sensible. And maybe holding up ammunition for the cameras was grandstanding. Watch: Twitter filled with sickening death wishes for George H.W. Bush . But there is a vitriol in the many messages, tweets and posts accusing me of not understanding that a journalist isn't above the law. On that point, I couldn't agree more. But would a regular person be prosecuted for carrying a magazine with no bullets if no violence was involved? Even the Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page agrees that going after Gregory makes no sense. What's striking here is that gun enthusiasts often make the argument that they just want government to leave them alone, yet seem perfectly comfortable unleashing it against a member of the mainstream media, supporting the Second Amendment by trashing the First. The same kind of animus has been directed at CNN's Piers Morgan, an outspoken advocate of gun control. For no other reason than that they don't like his views, more than 90,000 people have signed a petition calling for the British journalist to be deported. Watch: Should NBC's David Gregory be jailed for waving ammunition on air? The petition is meaningless, except in this respect: as a demonstration that so many people would support kicking someone out of the country for purely political reasons, without even the fig leaf of a technical offense. Can Morgan be overbearing? It was not his finest hour when he questioned during an interview whether gun rights advocate Larry Pratt is an ""unbelievably stupid man."" He's fair game for equally strong criticism in return. But deportation is way out there as a remedy for media advocacy. Morgan has handled the situation with humor, tweeting: ""Still only 90,000 Americans have signed the White House petition to deport me. That leaves 310,910,000 who presumably want me to stay."" Emotions are obviously raw in the aftermath of the Connecticut tragedy, which saw 20 young and defenseless children gunned down. Watch: From David Petraeus to Trayvon Martin, a 2012 media report card . Those who believe that guns are being unfairly blamed, led by the NRA, are lashing out at politicians, video game makers, entertainment conglomerates and, of course, the media. To the extent that leading journalists are in the forefront of this debate, they are feeling the sting of that anger. The uproar against the Journal-News newspaper for printing a map of gun permit owners in two suburban New York counties, which I view as violating their privacy without a good reason, can attest to that. It's hardly surprising that things are getting heated, given the emotional intensity of the gun issue. But proclamations about locking up and banishing journalists deserve to be seen as little more than outlandish chatter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Emotion over gun control battle is trumping reason .

"(CNN) -- Syria has destroyed a majority of its chemical weapons material, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Saturday. ""The Syrian Arab Republic has removed or destroyed in-country approximately 80 percent of its chemical weapons material,"" according to the OPCW Executive Council. The OPCW also said Saturday that the regime of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is now on track to complete the disposal of the country's chemical weapons in the next few days. If that happens, Syria would meet the deadline set by the OPCW for the destruction of the weapons before the end of April. ""The renewed pace in movements is positive and necessary to ensure progress towards a tight deadline,"" said Sigrid Kaag, special coordinator of the OPCW-U.N. Joint Mission in Damascus. In March, Syria submitted to the OPCW a revised proposal for its chemical weapons disposal with a deadline at the end of April. That revised deadline proposal followed a February report by the OPCW that the country had shipped out just 11% of its weapons stockpile for disposal, falling far short of a February 5 deadline to have all such weapons removed. The slow pace of removal prompted U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to warn in January that all options remain available to force compliance. Al-Assad agreed to get rid of all of Syria's chemical weapons last fall to avoid a possible U.S. military strike against the regime. Attacks in Syria claim at least 13 lives . As the country remains on track for disposal of its chemical weapons, the violence in the years-long civil war rages on. Attacks in three cities Saturday killed at least 13 people and injured dozens more. A car bomb exploded in Hama Saturday, killing four people and injuring nine others, a source at Hama Police Command told SANA, Syria's national news agency. The bomb targeted a convoy of four trucks carrying humanitarian aid workers with the Syrian Red Crescent organization. Mortar shelling and rocket attacks on neighborhoods in Homs left six people dead and at least 40 others injured. A car bomb also exploded near a mosque in Homs Saturday, according to SANA. An unknown number of casualties are reported in that attack. Three people were killed, including a 3-year-old child, and more than a dozen injured in mortar attacks on neighborhoods in Aleppo, according to SANA. SANA is also reported attacks in Daraa and Damascus Saturday injured at least 24 people, including 14 children. French journalists released . Four French journalists held hostage in Syria for the past 10 months are now on their way home. Journalists Edouard Elias, Didier FranÃ§ois, Nicolas Henin and Pierre Torres are in good health despite the tough conditions they endured during their captivity, the Elysee Palace said in a statement released Saturday. The men were taken hostage last June. French President Francois Hollande learned of the journalists' release with ""great relief,"" the statement said. The Elysee Palace also said the men are on their way home to France. Francois, a reporter, and Elias, a photographer, were on assignment in Syria for French radio station Europe 1 when they disappeared on June 6, 2013. They were en route to Aleppo and had already crossed the Turkish border into Syria when they vanished, according to the radio station. Reporter Henin and photographer Torres were taken hostage a short time later, on June 22, the French Foreign Ministry said last October. Henin was working on assignment for Le Point magazine and the TV channel Arte, while Torres was there to cover municipal elections, the ministry said. Syria was the most deadly nation in the world for journalists on the job in 2013. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported 29 journalists died covering the conflict there in 2013, including some who died in Lebanon or Turkey. The report says more than 60 have died covering the war in Syria so far. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","OPCW: A majority of Syria's chemical weapons have been destroyed .

"(CNN) -- About halfway through The New York Times review of TV chef Guy Fieri's Manhattan restaurant, I realized that the author was wielding a meat cleaver. Maybe it was Pete Wells' description of the chicken tenders as containing a ""shiny tissue of breading that exudes grease onto the plate."" Or the ""ghostly nubs of unblackened, unspiced white meat"" in the Cajun Chicken Alfredo. Or the comparison of Fieri to the writer Calvin Trillin -- if Trillin ""bleached his hair, drove a Camaro and drank Boozy Creamsicles."" It was at once delicious and stomach-churning -- a perfect reflection of our rip-their-lungs-out culture. Let's face it: Media meanness sells. Why slice someone with a surgical precision when you can whack him upside the head with a 2-by-4? Watch: Why Matt Lauer Is getting a bum rap from mean folks on Twitter . We've all enjoyed the guilty pleasure of seeing some author, actor or filmmaker eviscerated for the sheer sport of it. Good reviews are fine, but what really stirs the water-cooler talk is when the critic draws blood. But has this trend gone too far in an age when anyone can instantaneously diss anyone else with a single mouse click? Does it amount to pandering to our collective mean gene? Some public figures revel in the insult wars. Donald Trump has called Rosie O'Donnell ""a big fat pig,"" among other choice phrases, and she's said he keeps returning ""like a raging herpes rash."" It's a cheap way of getting attention. And the thing is, it works. Watch: Is it time for Chelsea Clinton, gay marriage activist, to leave NBC? The most popular pundits on television tend to be pugilists who draw cheers from their partisans for punching out the other guy's lights. When Bill O'Reilly denounces pinheads and loons, his fans eat it up. Rush Limbaugh caused a furor by calling Sandra Fluke a slut; he later apologized. Ed Schultz called Laura Ingraham a right-wing slut and did the same. Glenn Beck dubbed Barack Obama a racist and his ratings kept climbing. Nice guys don't necessarily finish first. The virus long ago spread to the political realm. Watch: Why Rupert Murdoch and other cranky CEOs tweet garbage . Republican Congressman Joe Wilson yelled ""you lie!"" during President Barack Obama's September 2009 speech to Congress on health care and then used the incident for fundraising. Another congressman, Democrat Alan Grayson, said the Republican health plan was to hope that sick people ""die quickly""; he lost the next election but just won his seat back. Yet another congressman, Allen West, called his Florida colleague Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""vile"" and ""not a lady""; he lost his seat during a recount. Watch: Sex and Sesame Street -- are the media exploiting the Elmo tragedy? The media, without question, reward incendiary soundbites and intemperate language. That's what keeps the bookers calling, and the resulting visibility can prompt donors to keep writing checks. Maybe Twitter has played a role in fostering succinct snarkiness. Everyone tries to break through the static and get retweeted. The new nastiness is evident in scandal coverage as well. While former CIA director David Petraeus has largely been portrayed as a flawed hero who made a tragic mistake, many in the media have cast Paula Broadwell as a harlot, using lust to achieve her ambition by bringing down a great man. Broadwell, a former senior Army captain, did some dumb things, such as sending harassing e-mails anonymously but doesn't it take two to tango? The same goes for Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite who engaged in voluminous e-mail correspondence with Gen. John Allen. Kelley, who volunteered for military causes, is being dismissed in media accounts as a ditzy social climber and worse. Watch: Lasting leak -- Why Romney's 'gifts' comments diminish him . Meanness wouldn't sell unless there was a market for it. Maybe watching others get sliced and diced makes us feel better about ourselves. Maybe it's just today's version of bread and circuses.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso could be forgiven for exuding an air of misty-eyed contentment as he sits among his own motorsport memorabilia at Madrid's Canal Art Center. Visitors have been poring over the Spaniard's silverware, cars and kit ever since the exhibition celebrating his near 30-year career opened last December. But he insists now is not the time for reminiscing. ""If you ask me this question in 10 years' time I will tell you less, because two championships are more than I could dream,"" the Formula One driver told CNN. ""If you ask me right now and I am in a middle of a competition, I am hungry for victories; hungry for success -- I will tell you that two championships are not enough."" Since winning his second world F1 title for Renault in 2006, Alonso has endured a frustrating time on the track. A three-year deal with McLaren ended prematurely after one season following a souring of relations with team boss Ron Dennis and his driving partner Lewis Hamilton. A return to Renault in 2008 saw him slip from third place to fifth in the drivers' championship -- a season that will be forever remembered for the so-called ""Crashgate"" affair -- and a year later Alonso registered just one podium and finished ninth overall in his worst showing since debuting for Minardi in 2001. The switch to Ferrari in 2010 has been more productive, yielding 11 grand prix wins and 31 podiums in 77 starts. But a third world title has remained just out of reach -- the 32-year-old has finished second to Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel in three of the past four seasons. But it's anyone's guess what might happen this year, with all teams and drivers grappling with a new car following a complete overhaul of F1's technical regulations. With the first pre-season testing session now complete, Ferrari have learned much about their new-look F14 T. Alonso finished second fastest on the final day in Jerez, Spain and completed the second most number of laps overall. By contrast, reigning champions Red Bull managed just 20 laps over all four days. ""These were four very demanding and important days to give us something to work on over the coming days in Maranello,"" team principal Stefano Domenicali told Ferrari F1's official website. ""The important thing is to do as many laps as possible to give our engineers the data they need to continue with the development of the car. It would be premature to make any precise evaluations,"" he added. Alonso agrees saying it's too early to judge how the Italian team might fair this season. ""We are discovering every day new things about the car and new possibilities, so I think the potential is there,"" he said. ""The car has some good signs and, let's say, the philosophy that the car has been designed is just what we are seeing now on the data. So there is nothing wrong, nothing to be pessimistic about, but a lot of work to do."" Lower noses, raised eyebrows . Along with smaller engines -- 1.6-liter V6 turbos replace 2.4-liter V8s -- come smaller fuel tanks (100 kilos compared to around 150 last year) and a range of chassis alterations. The most obvious of these changes has been the lower nose cone, which is now a maximum height of 185 millimeters compared to last season's 550 millimeters. Alonso concedes it's a bit of cosmetic surgery that all teams have struggled with aesthetically. ""They are ugly, yeah. We have to be honest with that, you know, with our fans and ourselves first of all. ""So probably we will get used to these new aesthetics, let's say, but the first moment they are not good enough because people look at Formula One like excellence of motor sport, of aerodynamics, excellence of performance and technology -- and when you see those front part of the car, it doesn't look like all the things we've been saying. ""So I think we will find different solutions. I'm sure the engineers are clever enough to make the car fast and also beautiful."" Un-Finn-ished business . Alonso will also be forging a new partnership with new teammate Kimi Raikkonen this season. The flying Finn, who won his only world title driving for Ferrari in 2007, makes up one half of the most interesting Formula One pairings in recent times, and one which will test both men's skills on the track and their powers of diplomacy off it. ""I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and a huge motivation for myself first and also for the team, because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result,"" Alonso said. ""I know I need to deliver my best, if not I cannot be in front of Kimi, so that is only good and positive news for Ferrari."" Positive news for Ferrari, and everyone involved in F1, would be any improvement in the condition of Michael Schumacher. The German's agent Sabine Kehm announced last week that the 45-year-old, who has been in a medically-induced coma for over a month, was having his sedation reduced to start the ""waking-up process."" Schumacher, who won five of his seven world titles with Ferrari, suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps on December 29. ""I think we are (all) still in shock, after nearly one month,"" Alonso said. ""The day that I received the news I could not believe it, to be honest, because he is not a man that you think will have any problem. ""He was the man that can beat anything and can win any race and can do anything without any worries, so to see him and to see the accident... ""We are all hoping every day to have some good news coming from the hospital ... all (the) drivers have huge respect because he was the man that motivated us and he was the man who we were looking at when we were go-kart drivers."" Alonso's quest for a third drivers' championship title begins in Melbourne on March 16.

"(CNN) -- It's all become a blur of polls, predictions and prognostication. The final days of the presidential race have been a head-spinning experience, giving us a collective case of vertigo as the media deliver their own ever-changing analyses while also conveying the strategists' spin. If it were up to me, I would ban all reporting of campaign officials declaring that their guy is going to win, or that their internal polls actually show them ahead in Ohio or Florida. Unconstitutional, I know, but it would spare us all kinds of utterly useless information. We all want to know who's going to win. But in a contest this tight, that's almost impossible to forecast with any certainty. So journalists flock to each new tracking poll as if, at long last, the mystery will be solved and the future revealed. Right now, the consensus has congealed around the idea that President Barack Obama will win a second term. Maybe that's right, but keep in mind that we imbue a 2- or 3-point lead by Obama in a state such as Florida with almost cosmic significance, even though his advantage may fall within the margin of error. Watch: Getting Campaign Vertigo from the Relentless Media Spin . Remember when some conservatives were carping that the media were skewing the polls in the president's favor? You don't hear much of that since Mitt Romney surged in the surveys. The notion that a wide array of media organizations were cooking the books was as ludicrous as, say, the charge that the Obama administration was manipulating the unemployment figures. There has been a manic-depressive quality to reporting on the race, as the conventional wisdom has changed shape like an overactive amoeba. Watch: Late-Night Comics Savage Romney, Not Obama . A year ago, the media kept telling us that Obama would have an awfully difficult time winning re-election unless the economy improved. By the time Romney emerged from the GOP demolition derby, the betting was that he was so damaged he was unlikely to win. After the conventions, Romney was viewed as such a flop that conservative commentators started debating the reasons he would lose. Then came Obama's disastrous first debate. Romney shot up in the polls, and the commentators started saying the president had blown the race. Only in recent days, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, has the press pack shifted yet again to the notion that Obama will win enough swing states to get to 270. That is, unless you believe Karl Rove and Dick Morris, both of whom have predicted a Romney victory on Fox News. Watch: Why Do Media Deem Obama-Christie Teamwork So Strange? If Obama does win, the coverage of the president's role in dealing with the hurricane -- and especially his bromance with Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- might turn out to be a factor. Even Republicans are telling me that privately. Given the magnitude of the storm, journalists had little choice but to focus on Obama's role as emergency coordinator, which relegated Romney to the sidelines after a period in which he had been gaining momentum. But the endless ink and airtime devoted to a Republican governor teaming up with a Democratic president during a crippling disaster was a bit troubling. Was it really so jaw-dropping that the two men might briefly put politics aside with so many lives lost and millions without power or gasoline? The cynicism that permeated the coverage was disturbing. Watch: Enough With Campaigns Predicting They'll Win . Of course, politics reared its head when unnamed Romney advisers told Politico that Christie had gone too far and their man had almost picked him as a running mate before changing his mind. And they all spoke anonymously, a practice with which journalists have long been too complicit. Now, mercifully, comes the actual vote. But if you think the media speculation game ends Tuesday, guess again. Sometime in the late afternoon, the first wave of exit polls will undoubtedly leak, either to Matt Drudge or some blogger, and spread like wildfire across the Web. These numbers will be about as reliable as those that convinced John Kerry's team in 2004 that he had won the presidency.

"(CNN) -- Win Tin, a founding member of Myanmar's National League for Democracy who was jailed for 19 years for political activism, has died at Yangon Hospital. He was 85. A National League for Democracy (NLD) spokesperson told CNN Win Tin was admitted to Yangon Hospital three weeks ago with a kidney problem. One of Myanmar's most prominent dissidents, Win Tin was a journalist and writer who joined with Aung San Suu Kyi during her campaign in 1988, according to Nyan Win, the current spokesperson for the NLD. He was arrested in 1989 by Myanmar's military rulers, who feared the strength of the pro-democracy movement. ""Immediately after his arrest, U Win Tin was kept without food and sleep for three days,"" Suu Kyi wrote about his imprisonment. ""It appeared that the interrogators wished to force him to admit he was my adviser on political tactics, in other words, that he was my puppet master."" ""A man of courage and integrity, U Win Tin would not be intimidated into making false confessions,"" she added. Win Tin continued to push for democracy even while in prison, penning a letter to the United Nations that resulted in additional jail time. Despite his key role as a political leader, Win Tin's personal life was largely solitary. After he was released in 2008, he told CNN that he was a ""vagabond"" with no family or children because he had given his life to the fight for democracy in Myanmar. While he struck an optimistic note about the progress that had been made in his country after his release, he noted there was still a ""tremendous amount of work to be done."" ""He was a great pillar of strength,"" said Nyan Win. ""His demise at this important political juncture of transition is a great loss not only to the NLD but also to the country. We are deeply saddened.""","Myanmar political activist and National League for Democracy founding member Win Tin has died at 85 .

"Lisbon, Portugal (CNN) -- President Barack Obama stood by new controversial screening measures Saturday, calling methods such as pat-downs and body scans necessary to assure airline safety. Speaking at a NATO press conference in Lisbon, Portugal, the president called the balance between protecting travelers' rights and their security a ""tough situation."" Per the new rules, travelers may be subject to full-body scans at 400 such machines in 69 airports nationwide. Those who voluntarily opt out -- as well as those who set off a scanning machine or a metal detector -- are subject to a pat-down. Some travelers have likened the pat-downs to groping. The president said such methods are needed after what happened December 25, 2009, when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab of Nigeria allegedly boarded a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit with a bomb hidden in his underwear. Abdulmutallab reportedly failed to set off the bomb, which metal detectors didn't detect, though his attempt led to airport screening procedures that have caused a holiday travel uproar. ""At this point, the Transportation Security Administration, in consultation with our counterterrorism experts, have indicated to me that the procedures that they've been putting in place are the only ones right now that they consider to be effective against the kind of threat that we saw in the Christmas Day bombing,"" said Obama. TSA officers can use ""professional discretion"" to determine whether individuals should be subject to further screening, according to a statement from the federal agency. Critics have called the procedures invasive, with Rutherford Institute President John Whitehead saying the agency ""is forcing travelers to consent to a virtual strip search or allow an unknown officer to literally place his or her hands in your pants."" The president, while noting that he didn't have personal experience with the new security measures, said he understands ""people's frustrations. He said he's asked TSA for assurances that ""what we're doing is the only way to assure the American people's safety."" He said that he has also told the federal agency's administrators that they must consider whether there are ""less intrusive"" ways to obtain the same goals. ""One of the most frustrating aspects of this fight against terrorism is that it has created a whole security apparatus around us that causes huge inconvenience for all of us,"" he said. Obama said that transportation security officials have a tough task, facing ""enormous pressure"" to prevent a terrorist attack. In a public statement released Saturday, TSA Administrator John Pistole spelled out the new security measures and offered tips to those flying this Thanksgiving week. ""As you travel this holiday season, I want to remind you that TSA's mission is to ensure the safety of you the traveling public and we are committed to doing so efficiently, courteously and professionally,"" Pistole said. In Portugal, the president vowed he'd try to find a way to make passengers feel more both comfortable and safe, whether it is through the current policies or with new ones. ""Every week I meet with my counterterrorism team and I'm constantly asking them whether -- is what we're doing absolutely necessary? Have we thought it through? Are there other ways of accomplishing it that meet the same objectives?"" he said.","NEW: TSA chief spells out security measures .

"(CNN) -- Croatia international Josip Simunic will miss the World Cup after being banned for 10 matches by FIFA for his 'pro-Nazi' chants as he celebrated his country's qualification to the finals in Brazil next year. FIFA's disciplinary committee said Monday that Simunic's chants following Croatia's 2-0 win over Iceland in a playoff match last month -- were ""discriminatory and offended the dignity of a group of persons concerning ... race, religion or origin."" The 35-year-old Simunic had grabbed a microphone at the end of the match in Zagreb on November 19 and shouted loudly ""za dom"" -- translated from Croatian as ""for the homeland"" -- with the crowd replying ""spremni"", meaning ""ready"", four times in response. ""The committee took note that the player, together with the crowd, shouted a Croatian salute that was used during World War II by the fascist ""Ustase"" movement,"" read a statement on the official FIFA website. ""Given the gravity of the incident, the committee decided to suspend the player for ten official matches,"" the statement went on, adding the stipulation that the ban would take effect only from the start of the World Cup next June. Simunic has also been banned from the stadiums where the matches are being played and has been fined 30,000 Swiss francs ($33,530). Simunic, who was born in Australia, has always denied his chants had fascist connotations. ""I was born and raised in countries with western democratic systems and any form of intolerance or bigotry is strange to me and not a part of my personal system of values,"" he told the official website of the Croatian football federation. ""Additionally, I have devoted my entire life to doing anything I could to help my country, Croatia, and I am immensely proud of that."" Dinamo Zagreb defender Simunic spent the bulk of his career in the German Bundesliga and made his international debut for Croatia in 2001. Croatia has fallen foul of both European governing body UEFA and FIFA for the actions of its supporters in the past. UEFA sanctioned its federation on three occasions during Euro 2012 involving crowd disorder and racist behavior by its fans as they exited at the group stages. World governing body FIFA has also toughened its stance on racism with its president Sepp Blatter setting up a special task force earlier this year after several high-profile incidents.","Croatia international Josip Simunic handed 10-match ban .

"(CNN) -- Atletico Madrid overcame struggling Elche at the Vincente Calderon on Friday and moved a step closer to the club's first La Liga title in 18 years. Brazillian defender Joao Miranda rose at the far post to power home a header midway through the second half before Diego Costa scored an injury time penalty to seal a closely fought 2-0 victory. Atletico now requires three wins from its remaining four fixtures to claim the La Liga title. ""It was a very open and dangerous match,"" Atletico manager, Diego Simeone, told reporters in his post match press conference. ""We could not find space in the first half and they took chances on the break to create danger. Our attitude changed in the second half, the intensity increased and from persistence came the prize."" While pleased with the result, the Argentine coach will hope for a more convincing performance in his side's next fixture against Chelsea in the semifinal of the Champions League on Tuesday. Atleti struggled to break down their well-organized opponents all night and had to withstand a period of Elche pressure before Costa sealed victory in the 90th minute. A pedestrian first half produced few chances for either side with Atletico failing to register a single shot on target. At the other end, Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois had to be alert to make a smart save from Elche defender Cristian Sapunaru's header. Atleti brought on midfielder Raul Garcia at the start of the second period to offer an aerial threat going forward and the tactic almost paid immediate dividends. Garcia was brought down as he attacked a high-ball into the Elche box by the retreating Sapunaru. Referee Carlos Clos Gomez pointed to the spot but David Villa couldn't convert as he fired weakly at Elche keeper Manu Herrera. Ateltico didn't let the penalty miss effect them and kept pressing their opponents with a greater intensity than they had done in the first period. The breakthrough came in the 71st minute as Miranda climbed highest at the back post, directing a header back across goal and beyond Herrera who stood rooted to the spot. Elche, themselves seeking points as they attempt to move away from the relegation area, pressed forward in search of an equalizer but were caught on the break in injury time. Diego Costa burst through and was nudged in the back as he was about to shoot by Sapunaru who gave away his second penalty of the game and was shown a straight red card for denying a goal scoring opportunity. Costa stepped up to take the spot kick and sent the diving Herrera the wrong way. Atletico now stand atop the La Liga table on 85 points, six ahead of second placed Real Madrid and seven clear of reigning champions Barcelona. The Catalans can close the gap at the top of the table to four points with victory at home to fourth placed Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. They will have to do so without the services of Neymar, however, after the Brazilian striker was ruled out for at least four weeks with a metatarsal injury on Friday. Barcelona have suffered a dreadful few weeks, exiting the Champions League at the quarter final stage for the first time in six seasons, losing ground in La Liga after defeat at Granada and falling to defeat at the hands Real Madrid in the Copa Del Rey final on Wednesday. Real Madrid do not play this weekend after taking the option to postpone their match against Real Vallodolid in order to prepare for Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg clash with Bayern Munich.","Atletico Madrid move seven points clear at top of La Liga after victory over Elche .

"Boynton Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Freshman Republican Congressman Allen West clashed with an advocate for Muslim-American civil rights at a sometimes-rowdy town hall meeting Monday night. The tense exchange drew boos from a standing room only, largely Republican crowd. The confrontation came as West, an Iraq War veteran who was backed by the Tea Party in last November's election, took questions from constituents. Nezar Hamze, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Miami, stepped to the microphone and accused West of making anti-Muslim comments in the past. ""Me and my children choose to follow the faith of Islam. You consistently insult it. How can we expect you to defend our right and practice Islam as far as the Constitution is concerned?"" Hamze asked. ""I will always defend your right to practice a free religion under the First Amendment,"" West said. ""But what you must understand, if I am speaking the truth, I am not going to stop speaking the truth. The truth is not subjective,"" he continued to loud applause. West's comments on Islam have stirred controversy in the past. He recently said Muslim Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota, represents ""the antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established."" The new GOP congressman pulled no punches commenting on the political crisis in Egypt, drawing parallels between the chaos in that country and the 1979 revolution in Iran. West said the U.S. must stop the Egyptian militant group, the Muslim Brotherhood, from seizing power. ""President Carter, President Obama, Iran, Egypt, the Shah, Mubarak, the Ayatollah, the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a scary parallel. We cannot allow the Muslim Brotherhood to fill the void of leadership that can occur in Egypt,"" West said. Monday night's event was one of the country's first town hall meetings since the near assassination of Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at a constituent event in Tucson, Arizona, in January. The tragedy was followed by calls from Republicans and Democrats to tone down political rhetoric. Determined to meet with his constituents once a month, West says he is taking his own precautions to stay safe. West, who has a permit to carry concealed weapons in Florida, also suggested to reporters he will be armed at some of his events. ""I've had a concealed weapons license for quite some time, about the last two to three years, and I take it upon myself and my personal responsibility, but I choose the venues in which I'll carry,"" West told CNN. Asked if he was carrying a gun Monday night, West replied, ""I can't tell you that."" The audience at Monday's meeting sounded more like a pep rally than a town hall. West's promises to oppose the new health care law and efforts to raise the nation's debt ceiling drew rounds of applause. It was a sign that many Tea Party activists still plan to attend these constituent events, if only to cheer on members of Congress they support. Still West encouraged his opponents to speak up at his town halls. ""If there is someone here who resides in Congressional District 22 who did not vote for Allen West, I want to hear from you,"" West said. ""I want to know how I can better serve you and be a better representative.""","Allen West was backed by the Tea Party in November's election .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A woman called 911 soliciting help for actress Demi Moore, whom she said was ""convulsing"" and ""burning up"" after ""smoking something,"" according to a recording of the call obtained Friday from the Los Angeles Fire Department. The star of ""Ghost,"" ""A Few Good Men,"" ""G.I. Jane"" and other films was rushed to a Southern California hospital late Monday night after the call. The 911 call features an unidentified woman referring to Moore and saying, ""She smoked something -- it's not marijuana, but it's similar to incense. And she seems to be having convulsions of some sort."" The same woman described Moore as ""semi-conscious"" and ""barely"" breathing. She claimed that, while Moore meant to smoke the unidentified substance, her reaction to it was ""accidental."" Another woman then got on the phone to talk to the 911 operator, saying that Moore was ""sort of shaking, convulsing (and) burning up."" ""She's been having some issues with some other stuff,"" the woman added. Earlier this week, a representative for Moore said after the incident that the actress -- who recently separated from her husband, Ashton Kutcher -- has been dealing with stress. ""Demi has chosen to seek professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and improve her overall health,"" the representative said in a statement. ""She looks forward to getting well and is grateful for the support of her family and friends."" Moore had been slated to portray Gloria Steinem in the Linda Lovelace biopic, ""Lovelace."" But her representative said she is no longer working on the film. The production said in a press release that ""Sex and the City"" star Sarah Jessica Parker will take over that role.","The L.A.

"(CNN) -- Would you stay in a country whose neighbor was hurling threats warning of an imminent ""moment of explosion""? It's a question many expats, business travelers and tourists currently in South Korea are pondering, as tensions simmer in the region. While South Korea remains one of the world's most ethnically homogenous nations, approximately 2% of the population comes from foreign shores -- many of them students or English teachers. (Some South Korean media reports estimate as many as 22,000 teachers of English as a second language are in the country.) Recent events have left many unnerved, but also pragmatic, and looking to their South Korean colleagues and friends for advice. U.S. teacher Vincent E. Van Wattum, originally from Connecticut, has worked in Gyeongju, South Korea, at a boys' high school for the past two years. Despite global unease over spiraling tensions on the peninsula, he says he and his colleagues remain largely unmoved by recent events. ""Reactions are non-existent at the moment,"" he said. ""My co-teachers and I have never discussed it and it never comes up among Koreans in general conversation."" Timeline: North Korea's threats and bluster . However, he acknowledges that a moment of nervousness did lead him to take some precautions. ""I was (slightly) scared the other day when I thought I heard air raid sirens going off on my way home from school,"" he said. ""Just in case, I packed a light bag, ready with my passport, some cash and a change of clothes ready to go if I need to get out of Dodge."" South Korea has had almost 60 years to prepare for any future conflict with its belligerent neighbor, and the country is quick in times of tension to roll out precautionary measures. South Koreans' unflappability in the face of such an existential threat has impressed many foreigners, and encouraged some at least to feel safer. Floridian Tay-Marie Astudillo, who also teaches English in South Korea, recently noticed that subway stations in Seoul had been outfitted with emergency equipment display cases, including instructions on how to wear a gas mask. ""It's the norm,"" she says. ""I've noticed the increase for about three weeks now, since rhetoric had really been starting to heat up from North Korea. I think it's good the city is preparing just in case."" North Korea: Our global fear and fascination . U.S. student Issis Danielle Gonzalez says her mother back in Rio Grande City, Texas, asked her to pack a bag and be ready to leave should anything happen. Friends of hers on the U.S. Army base in the Yongsan district of Seoul, where thousands of U.S. troops are stationed, also told her it was best to be prepared in the event of conflict. It's a bizarre contrast, Gonzalez explained. ""In South Korea life is going on as if nothing is happening, but from the updates from my mom the worry creeps in,"" she said. ""I just hope my wonderful journey in South Korea thus far doesn't end in disaster. "" The North's fiery rhetoric has sparked jitters in the U.S, with a recent CNN/ORC International poll of Americans revealing that 41% of those surveyed saw North Korea as an immediate threat to the U.S., an all-time high. Californian Christina Danel, who is currently teaching English in Incheon, South Korea, has found that the stoicism of her South Korean friends and colleagues about the current situation on the Korean Peninsula is not shared by her American family and friends. ""They (my family) want me to leave because they fear, since Incheon is very near to Seoul, there is the possibility of a bombing occurring,"" she says. ""All the foreigners I know are somewhat worried and are considering leaving the country early."" South Korea 'views Kim Jong Un as man-child' Were the worst to happen, she says, she plans to get to the airport as soon as possible. ""Considering that North Korea has made failed flight attempts before, I feel that if they were to send a missile toward Seoul their calculations would be off and I may be in harm's way if that happens,"" she says. The pleas of her family were echoed by relatives of U.S. tourist Eugene Benoit, currently traveling in South Korea visiting friends. He, too, has been struck by the calm atmosphere, but his family members are unnerved. ""My wife and daughters and my mother are all saying: 'Come home early, it is too dangerous there!'"" he says. ""But I say there is nothing to worry about and I am sincere about that."" Why tensions have erupted so suddenly -- and why now -- is a question many in the international community are struggling to answer. For Canadian teacher Leigh MacArthur, who has lived in South Korea for almost a decade, all fingers point to the North's inexperienced new leader, Kim Jong Un. ""I feel that he is having to prove himself to his military -- some of whom I'm guessing served under his grandfather -- that he is in fact in charge and still has his grandfather's and father's ideologies at heart,"" he says. In Samcheok, in the east of South Korea, where MacArthur now lives, he says people are still very much carrying on with their lives, with no panic buying of essentials and people still focused on their day-to-day business. He, for one, is determined to follow their example -- for now. ""I made a choice years ago that I would not live in fear or worry about the situations that may or may not happen in regards to North Korea,"" he said. ""I haven't thought of leaving the country, not yet."" Interactive: North Korea's missile capabilities .","Expats look to South Korean colleagues and friends for advice .

"(CNN) -- The search is on for the next David Beckham. In a dream match up, the talent agency which represents global superstars Oprah Winfrey, Matt Damon and Christian Bale has bought sports agency IMG, which deals with tennis ace Novak Djokovic and NFL star Peyton Manning. The price of merging sport and entertainment is a reported $2.3 billion, paid by Hollywood agency William Morris Endeavor and private equity partner Silver Lake. ""This has all come about with the process of sport morphing into entertainment,"" Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at England's Coventry University, told CNN. ""If you look at some of the sports personalities who are in the IMG portfolio then you realize they're not just sports stars. They are brands."" Chadwick believes this agency tie up is an attempt to create ""brand longevity"" for their clients. ""Take David Beckham, who is the perfect model for what agencies want from their brands,"" said Chadwick. ""He went from being a football player to a fashion icon, has moved on to being a sporting ambassador and now he's on the brink of becoming a franchise owner,"" added Chadwick, referring to Beckham's interest in bringing a new Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise to Miami.. ""Beckham is like a template. It's all about the creativity and longevity of the brand and that's what Beckham has achieved."" According to figures reported by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the sports business is set to grow to around $68 billion by 2017 from $57 billion this year within North America -- an increase of about 5% per annum. The acquisition will give William Morris all the rights to IMG's college sports business and a whole list of stellar names currently looked after by the agency including Justin Timberlake, Djokovic, Maria Sharapova and Taylor Swift. ""IMG has incredible strategic value to WME,"" said William Morris' co-CEOs Patrick Whitesell and Ariel Emanuel. ""The brand's global reach, outstanding management team and leadership across sports, fashion and media are a strong complement to our business."" WME, which represents Steven Spielberg and Denzel Washington, is now hoping to capitalize on the appeal of global sports stars such as Djokovic and Sharapova. ""I was somewhat concerned that IMG would be taken over by venture capitalists,"" added Chadwick. ""I think it's better in some ways that this kind of organization has taken them over.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Sports researchers have found that body shape is a key ingredient to success for footballers. A study has found tall footballers like Peter Crouch are more likely to succeed. The study compared official English Football Association data from the the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and between 2003 to 2004 to reach its conclusions. It was authored by Professor Alan Nevill, a lecturer at the University of Wolverhampton, United Kingdom. Nevill told CNN tall, lean players like England star Peter Crouch, Thierry Henry and Ruud van Nistelrooy are the most successful -- and went as far to suggest that talent scouts should consider looking for this body type when searching for new recruits. More than 800 players were assessed for the research, and whether the player was in a top six team or not, at the end of each season was used as a measure for success, as they were more likely to be playing in European competitions, Nevill said. Do taller players make better footballers? Tell us what you think . Recent analysis also showed that players in more successful teams were taller, more linear, and younger than those from less successful teams, he said. This assertion from the research suggests that the top teams in the Premier League and other major competitions would be more likely to win if they have taller, leaner and younger team members. ""Successful teams appear to have players nearly two years younger on average than other teams,"" he said. Nevill told CNN the findings linked in to how the game of football had changed in recent decades. ""The less successful teams today are characterized as being a bit more muscular. However, in the 1980s, this was linked with more success. ""I'm quite convinced that the younger, lighter, more nimble and also taller players are more capable of making the finishing touches today,"" he said. Nevill said there were several reasons why the taller player had advantages. ""Apart from the fact that taller players will be more successful at heading the ball both defensively and in attack, they will be able to close down or limit opposition players' ability to pass and distribute the ball. ""Furthermore, taller, thinner people are able to dissipate heat more rapidly than shorter, heavier people."" Players had also increased in size over the study period, Nevill said. ""The results of the study show that professional footballers are getting taller and heavier per decade, with a small but significant rise in the BMI (Body Mass Index) over the four decades."" Despite the findings, Nevill said it was not the end for shorter players, as there would always be cases where shorter and bulkier players could still succeed. ""Obviously there will be lots of anecdotes where our findings are not going to be the case,"" he said. The findings of the research have been published in the Journal of Sports Sciences.","Research at a UK university finds taller footballers more likely to succeed .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. House of Representatives Thursday overwhelmingly passed a new version of the Stolen Valor Act, a bill aimed at people who lie about receiving military medals and then attempt to profit from the deception. The first version of the Stolen Valor Act was struck down by the Supreme Court as a violation of the First Amendment. Justices dismiss law making lying about military honors a crime . The bill focuses not on people who lie about having medals they didn't earn, but on any profits they make from lying about the medals, which is essentially criminal fraud. Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nevada) sponsored the new bill. His office issued a release saying the bill passed by a vote of 410-3. Heck said in a floor speech this week that the bill would survive judicial review because it resolves the ""constitutional issues by clearly defining that the objective of the law is to target and punish those who misrepresent the alleged service with the intent of profiting personally or financially."" The bill targets those who falsely claim to have earned certain major military decorations, including the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, Silver Star, Purple Heart or a medal signifying you served in combat. A similar bill is moving through the Senate, but has not reached a floor vote yet.

"Washington (CNN) -- Dueling scientists, a former trainer, friends and family are among the witnesses whose testimony a jury will consider as they decide if famed baseball pitcher Roger Clemens lied to Congress during an investigation of steroid use among major league players. The case against Clemens involves one count of obstruction of Congress, three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury. He is not charged with illicit use of performance-enhancing drugs, but his denial of such use is part of the case against him. Federal prosecutor Courtney Saleski, in closing arguments Tuesday, told the jury Clemens ""wanted to protect his brand, he wanted to protect his livelihood,"" in denying the use of steroids during a 2008 investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives into the problem. ""He did that at the expense of our Congress. He threw sand in their eyes. He stole the truth from them,"" Saleski said. She said a guilty verdict would give that truth back to lawmakers. The Clemens defense team disputed whether the government has made its case, telling the jury all the evidence came through a former personal trainer, Brian McNamee, who had incentive to lie. ""You saw Brian McNamee, the only witness in the history of the world who says he gave or saw an injection of that man,"" said defense attorney Michael Attanasio. ""One person in the entire world."" During closing arguments, the defense cited the lack of corroborating witnesses, which they said would be a basis for reasonable doubt against any conviction. ""McNamee defines reasonable doubt,"" Attanasio said, because of perceived inconsistencies, retractions and corrections he made while testifying. After verbally providing instructions to the jury late Tuesday, U.S. District judge Reggie Walton sent the jury back to begin deliberations, while acknowledging they may only have time to select a foreperson before letting them go for the day. The trial has run longer than envisioned, and one juror was moved to alternate status Tuesday because of a fellowship in Germany for which he must depart next week. An alternate was then sent back to join the others. It took about eight weeks for the prosecution and defense to question 46 witnesses, and the most direct conflict came among expert witnesses as to how to interpret a collection of discarded medical items that allegedly link Clemens to steroid use. Soiled medical wrappings, cotton balls, drug vials and hypodermic needles that McNamee kept were interpreted differently by both sides. Witnesses for the government said genetic material linked with Clemens suggested it was impossible for McNamee to fabricate the evidence. But defense witnesses on the same topic said storage in a beer can for years allowed commingling and contamination of materials, making reliable conclusions impossible, and the evidence nearly worthless. ""If you have garbage at the start, you'll have garbage at the end,"" said defense expert witness Dr. Bruce Goldberger, who said his lab would refuse to test such materials without a solid basis for their storage and handling before analysis. Prosecution witness Dr. Cynthia Morris-Kukoski, an FBI toxicologist, said it is not up to the toxicology lab to make judgments about the materials submitted for testing, with their job only to determine the substances and any genetic identifiers involved. Former teammate and friend Mike Boddicker testified as to whether Clemens had ever accepted injections, providing an eyewitness account that he had. ""I think it was either 1989 or 1990,"" Boddicker said, referring to their time together with the Boston Red Sox, describing that he ""came into the training room, and saw Roger bent over the table with his pants down, getting a shot."" The vial, Boddicker said, was clearly marked ""B-12"" a substance said to provide a pick-me-up after a game or workout. This is the second trial for Clemens. A year ago, a mistrial was declared before the case reached the jury. The government's lawyers played video evidence the judge had already banned. Prosecutors said it was an editing mistake, but the Clemens defense team suggested prosecutors were unprepared and had gotten off to a bad start. ""This was a mistake, a regretful mistake,"" government attorney David Goodhand said in September in arguing for a new trial. But Walton blasted prosecutors for letting inadmissible evidence be shown. ""I would hate to believe they just blatantly disregarded rulings that I made, but it's hard for me to reach any other conclusion,"" Walton said, before rejecting a defense request that he dismiss the indictment entirely. After consideration, Walton then ordered the new trial. Several pretrial hearings this time included protests from defense attorneys that the prosecution was trying to take advantage of having heard the initial opening statement last summer by the defense. In the latest trial, defense attorneys expressed concern that prosecutors were trying to ""do over"" certain efforts the defense may have refuted. Deliberations Wednesday were set to begin at 1:30 p.m.","Second trial involves 46 witnesses over eight weeks .

"PENSACOLA, Florida (CNN)  -- Three suspects are in custody, including two who face murder charges, in what the local sheriff called a ""multifaceted""  investigation into the killings of a Gulf Coast couple known for adopting special-needs children. Byrd and Melanie Billings were found shot to death Thursday night in their home near Pensacola, Florida. Wayne Coldiron and Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. are facing murder charges in the Thursday night shooting deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings, said Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia County. Coldiron, 41, surrendered to investigators Sunday and Gonzalez was arrested in neighboring Santa Rosa County on Sunday evening, Morgan said. Gonzalez's age was not immediately released. The sheriff was in the middle of announcing Coldiron's arrest to reporters when detectives informed him that Gonzalez was in custody.  Watch sheriff learn of second arrest » . Morgan said the investigation has become ""a window into something bigger,"" with multiple motives and multiple suspects. But he released few details. ""I know this sounds like we're talking in circles,"" he told reporters earlier Sunday. ""But at this point, we cannot release that information, because those circles have not been completed."" In addition, Gonzalez's father, Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Sr., 56, has been arrested on evidence-tampering charges. The elder Gonzalez is accused of trying to disguise a red Dodge van that surveillance cameras captured leaving the slain couple's home. Investigators had distributed images of the van, and its discovery Saturday was ""the linchpin in this case,"" Morgan said. Gonzalez ""was covering damage and painting the van ... so that it would not be readily recognizable."" The Billingses lived in Beulah, west of Pensacola, near the Alabama state line. There were eight children, ranging in age from infancy to 11 years, in the home with them when they were killed. The children were unharmed and were being cared for by relatives, authorities said.

"(CNN) -- Five years ago Sunday, the water rushed in, the lights went out and for thousands of Gulf Coast residents nothing was ever the same. The milestone was marked by vigils, tears and reflection on what was, what came after, what still remains to be done and what, if anything, we have learned from Hurricane Katrina. A number of events were planned in New Orleans, Louisiana, and elsewhere to commemorate the anniversary of the landfall of Katrina, the costliest and one of the five deadliest storms ever to strike the United States. President Barack Obama visited New Orleans on Sunday and spoke at Xavier University of Louisiana, where he said that the construction of a fortified levee system to protect the city is under way. ""We should not be playing Russian roulette every hurricane season,"" he said. Obama also vowed that reforms are being put into place ""so that never again in America is somebody left behind in a disaster because they're living with a disability or because they're elderly or because they're infirm. That will not happen again."" The hard-hit parishes of Plaquemines and St. Bernard were holding commemorative community events, and a third commemoration was planned in New Orleans' Jackson Square. Katrina left more than 1,800 dead in its wake. It slammed into the Gulf Coast near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line early on August 29, 2005. Most of the dead were in and around New Orleans, where more than three-quarters of the city flooded after its protective levees failed. Nearly 300,000 people were displaced. After the storm, ""We were a city that had no people in it,"" Ray Nagin, who was mayor of New Orleans when Katrina struck. ""Now, we're a city that has over 80 percent of its population back. Lowest unemployment in the country. Construction everywhere. I think we're on our way to success,"" Nagin told CNN's Don Lemon as the storm's anniversary approached. Still, it is widely agreed that more work remains to bring New Orleans and the Gulf Coast back from Katrina's devastating blow. Some say that little has improved, and entire neighborhoods in Louisiana and beyond have not rebounded. ""Nothing's really changed,"" said Conrad Wyre III, 35, of New Orleans. Some regions are still ""in shambles,"" he said, and some residents still feel helpless and without support, as if they are ""floating in the wind."" About 6,000 families own homes that cannot be rebuilt. One-third of New Orleanians say their lives are still disrupted by the storm, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation Poll. In New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood -- seen as ground zero for Katrina's wrath -- only 4,000 of 18,000 residents have returned. ""I don't have to tell you that there are still too many vacant and overgrown lots,"" Obama said Sunday. ""There are still too many students attending classes in trailers. There are still too many people unable to find work. And there's still too many New Orleans folks who haven't been able to come home."" ""So while an incredible amount of progress has been made, on this fifth anniversary, I wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly: My administration is going to stand with you -- and fight alongside you -- until the job is done, until New Orleans is all the way back."" ""This is the place ... where I think the American people witnessed a real loss of faith in their federal government,"" Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""I have really been moved by the spirit of the people in New Orleans in the Gulf, and their rebuilding, and the optimism in progress that I have seen. More than 90 percent of the population is back in the New Orleans area, and there is still much ahead of us."" When Obama took office, 40,000 families remained in Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers or were using emergency housing vouchers, ""and literally tens of thousands of them were at risk of losing their homes within weeks of us coming in,"" Donovan said. ""Today, 98 percent of the families are in permanent housing."" Katrina made its initial landfall in Florida, where 14 people were killed. But fueled by the warm waters of the Gulf, the storm had grown into a monster Category 5 hurricane, although experts later said its intensity had decreased and it was a strong Category 3 storm when it the coasts of Mississippi and Louisiana. The storm cut a wide swath of destruction, wiping out whole sections of Mississippi's Gulf Coast and swamping downtown Mobile, Alabama, with a 20-foot storm surge. Despite the attention focused on New Orleans, it was Waveland, Mississippi that was the hardest hit. Ninety-five percent of the town's homes were destroyed, along with 100 percent of its businesses. Nearly every road was broken up or left under piles of debris. Waveland began rebuilding almost immediately. Bolstered by $100 million in federal aid, it has repaired utilities, roads, schools, community centers and parks, and has recovered 65 percent of its businesses. About two-thirds of residents have returned. Ironically, the city of New Orleans initially breathed a sigh of relief in those early hours, as it was spared a direct hit from the hurricane and at first seemed to have weathered the wind and rain. But Katrina's worst havoc was yet to come, as reports of levee breaches began to surface and entire neighborhoods flooded. Katrina also dealt a black eye to the government, which scrambled to launch a delayed relief effort after the storm as New Orleans residents suffered and reports of crime and looting were widespread. Nagin in a famous expletive-laced interview lashed out, telling federal authorities to ""get off your asses."" Then-President George W. Bush traveled to New Orleans, delivering a speech from Jackson Square as he promised, ""We will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives."" But that ""turned out to be a hollow promise,"" Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""... Because the federal government didn't stay and do everything it could. The federal government didn't make it easy. They made it very, very difficult."" Mayors of New Orleans and other areas, when they requested money to rebuild, were offered loans of $5 million, she said. New Orleans' operating budget, she said, is $460 million, and $5 million ""wouldn't buy them a loaf of bread for the week."" Nagin told CNN recently that he has been reflecting on his own response as the storm approached. He acknowledged the mandatory evacuations could have been issued about eight hours sooner than they were. Asked how FEMA can combat its still-suffering reputation in the region, agency chief Craig Fugate told CNN Saturday he believes responding quickly is the key. ""Speed is going to be critical,"" said Fugate, who distinguished himself as the head of the Florida Emergency Management Agency before being appointed to the federal post. ""We cannot wait for a full assessment. We have to respond as if it's bad, bring the things together, and focus on the most immediate [goal] of keeping it safe, getting to the injured, trapped, and recovering the lost lives, getting supplies in here."" ""The big lesson from Katrina is, you can't wait to find out how bad it is,"" he said. ""You've got to respond, as a team, as [if] it is bad."" Obama said Sunday a group led by Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is examining disaster recovery nationwide. ""We're improving coordination on the ground, modernizing emergency communications and helping families plan for a crisis,"" Obama said. ""...Together we are helping to make New Orleans a place that stands for what we can do in America -- not just for what we can't do,"" he said. ""And ultimately, that must be the legacy of Katrina: not one of neglect, but of action; not one of indifference, but of empathy; not of abandonment, but of a community working together to meet shared challenges."" The head of FEMA at the time, Michael Brown, resigned two weeks after Katrina made landfall amid criticism of the federal response -- and 10 days after Bush's famous compliment to him, ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job."" Brown told CNN on Thursday the talking points he and other federal officials used at the time did not tell the whole story, calling it a ""fatal mistake."" ""They were factually correct, but weren't in context,"" Brown said. ""We're moving all of this stuff in. We have teams here. Rescue teams are doing this. But we never explained to the people that it's not coming as fast as we want it to, and it's not enough, because of the number of people that were left behind in the aftermath of the storm."" ""Had I said that at the time, I probably would have gotten the old hook and been pulled off the stage anyway, but the truth would have been out,"" he said. He criticized former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff's handling of the situation. Chertoff attended an avian flu convention in the midst of the disaster. ""Here is why that's so important. In the middle of any crisis,"" Brown said, ""whether it's a natural disaster or man-made disaster, you need to have one person in charge. And that person needs to be on the ground with the team, understanding what's going on."" On Bush's infamous compliment, he said, ""I knew the minute he said that, the media and everybody else would see a disconnect between what he was saying and what I was witnessing on the ground. That's the president's style. His attitude and demeanor is always one of being a cheerleader and trying to encourage people to keep moving. It was just the wrong time and the wrong place.""","NEW: Obama speaks at Xavier University in New Orleans .

"(CNN) -- The vacation home to five lifelong friends, who became CNN.com sensations because of group photos they have taken of themselves every five years for the past 30 years, has been burglarized. ""I feel angry and violated,"" said John Wardlaw, the owner of the lakeside cabin. ""It's just a shame. Last summer we get known for a feel-good story about friendship. Then the following year the cabin where all this bonding takes place is burglarized."" Wardlaw owns the California cabin near the Oregon border through a trust created by his grandfather, John Laux, an executive in the early years of radio and television. Wardlaw and his fellow graduates of Santa Barbara High School received worldwide attention after CNN wrote a story about their extraordinary friendship, captured in photographs they took sitting in the same order on the cabin deck near Copco Lake. The most expensive item the thieves stole is a boat valued at $8,500. ""There is no physical damage to the house, which is good because they didn't break things as they went through,"" Wardlaw said. ""We lost some things that were my grandfathers ... an antique oil lamp, his duck calls, a set of horns from a mountain goat."" The Siskiyou County sheriff is investigating the April burglary but says there are no suspects and no signs of the boat or other stolen items. ""Copco is a very quiet, peaceful lake, so it's just a great place to go with your family,"" said Allison Giannini of the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Department. ""It's not like those well-travelled areas."" Wardlaw, a filmmaker who specializes in documentaries and animation, said he learned of the robbery from some neighbors who noticed the boat and trailer were missing from their usual spot near the cabin carport. Wardlaw lives in Santa Barbara, but says he and his wife, Tricia, still make about five treks a year to the Copco Lake cabin, staying one or two weeks each trip to relax and fish. The cabin serves as a base for outdoor adventures at Crater Lake, the Oregon Caves and the Rogue River. ""They took everything related to the boat: electric motor, batteries, chargers, gas cans and every fishing rod,"" Wardlaw said. ""They stole my grandfather's .410 shotgun. It's small caliber. It was a bird hunting gun for him."" The cabin is a special place for Wardlaw, who does the carpentry to keep the cabin from falling apart in hot summers and frigid winters. He has replaced windows, deck planks and stained boards in the three-bedroom home built in 1970. Wardlaw re-sided the cabin in 2003. ""I found all sorts of acorns hidden by squirrels and, I think, woodpeckers,"" Wardlaw said. ""I also found a smoke bomb tossed in 1985 by John Dickson (one of the five guys.) There was a bird nest and they were in the walls making all sorts of noise and irritating us."" Dickson threw in a smoke bomb to flush them out. ""Little did we know he could have burned the cabin down,"" Wardlaw said. Dickson said the theft is disturbing. ""It's kind of a happy place for us for three decades,"" Dickson said. ""It's our little sanctuary. To be burglarized is just sad."" CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","A California sheriff investigates burglary at a remote vacation cabin .

"(CNN) -- Remember the name: Jordan Spieth is only 20 years of age, but the golfer is already being mentioned in the same breath as Tiger Woods after a whirlwind start to his PGA Tour career. Spieth, like Woods, was a multiple U.S. Junior Amateur champion before dominating college golf in his freshman year. Quickly turning professional, he became the first teenage winner on the PGA Tour in 82 years, and at this week's traditional curtain raiser to 2014 he finished second to veteran Zach Johnson at the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. Johnson, the 2007 Masters champion, carded four birdies in seven holes to pip joint third-round leader Spieth by a shot on Monday. The 37-year-old tweeted after his win: ""I love underdog stories"" -- a recognition of the youngster's growing reputation. Spieth is one of CNN Living Golf's ""Five players to watch"" in 2014, as he seeks to add to last year's maiden victory. Along with three of the biggest names in the sport -- who enjoyed wildly varying fortunes last season --we have also cast our net in the direction of Asia, where the emerging prodigies seem to get ever younger and ever more a threat to the established order on the PGA Tour. Jordan Spieth . Starting 2013 ranked 810th in the world and having turned professional halfway through his sophomore year at the University of Texas, Spieth ended it as the PGA Tour's Rookie of the Year and with a place on the winning U.S. Presidents Cup team. So highly-rated was Spieth, that his first victory on the PGA Tour at the John Deere Classic in July was hardly considered a surprise. He won a three-way playoff against defending champion Johnson and David Hearn after spectacularly holing from a greenside bunker on the final hole of regulation play to force the shootout. Spieth then lost in a playoff for the Wyndham Championship to another promising young golfer, 23-year-old Patrick Reed and charged to fourth in the Deutsche Bank Championship with a last-round 62. He ended the year just outside the world's top 20, earning the nod from Fred Couples as a captain's pick in the Presidents Cup. Woods was a teammate in the comfortable victory over the Internationals, and when asked about Spieth the world No. 1 gave the following verdict: ""He's earned his way on here and he's played exceptional golf and his talent is going to take him a long way over the years."" Tiger Woods . Woods may have ended 2013 as the PGA Tour's Golfer of the Year, but will want to finally lose the tag of ""14-time major winner"" and close on Jack Nicklaus's all-time record of 18. Woods has been stuck on 14 since winning the U.S. Open in June 2008 with an injured knee which required surgery and a lengthy recuperation. His well-chronicled personal problems also clearly impacted on his career and it was only last year which saw the re-emergence of a golfer resembling the former all-conquering Tiger. Five wins on the PGA Tour were ample evidence, but in the majors his best was tied fourth at the Masters and he will be focused on changing that stat. With youngsters like Spieth emerging and veterans like arch-rival Phil Mickelson showing no signs of fading away, Woods, who has just turned 38, knows this is a big year -- and the choice of venues for the majors could be in his favor. ""I'm really excited about the major championships next year. I've won at three of the four venues -- Augusta National, Valhalla Golf Club and Royal Liverpool -- and on Pinehurst No. 2 (U.S. Open), I'm trending the right way, having finished third and second,"" he told his own website. Woods skipped the opening tournament of the year in Hawaii to spend time with his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn -- who will miss the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi due to her own knee problem -- before beginning his own buildup to the Masters in April. He still holds the record low total at Augusta of 270 back in 1997 when he announced himself to the wider sporting public with a stunning victory. Rory McIlroy . McIlroy started 2013 as the world's top-ranked golfer and ended it as the sixth best after a series of on and off-course problems. With a new management team and a new fiancee -- he announced his engagement to Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki on New Year's Eve on Twitter -- the popular 24-year-old from Northern Ireland can enter 2014 with optimism. Buoyed by an end-of-year victory at the Australian Open, McIlroy has renewed confidence in himself and his Nike equipment after a big-money switch to the sportswear manufacturer at the start of 2012 that some linked to his poor form on the course. ""I'm confident with my game and confident where it's going,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""I won a major in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013, so I'll try to make up for that with two this year."" A bold prediction, but McIlroy clearly has the talent to back up his words and has been practicing hard in Dubai ahead of his opening tournament of the season at the Abu Dhabi Championship starting on January 16. He will lock horns with Woods for the first time in 2014 at the Dubai Desert Classic a fortnight later -- an early marker for the rest of the year. Adam Scott . Scott was denied the ""triple crown"" back in his home country in December by McIlroy, who mounted a final round charge to win at Royal Sydney. Following wins at the Australian PGA and Masters events, it would have capped a triumphant 2013 for the 33-year-old from Adelaide, who won his first major at Augusta. Scott also paired with Jason Day to win the World Cup for Australia and, combined with an impressive victory at The Barclays, the first event of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs, it left him second in the world rankings behind Woods at year's end. Many believe Scott will reach top spot in 2014 and add to his majors haul, having shrugged off the disappointment of letting a four-shot lead slip to hand Ernie Els the 2012 British Open crown. A dramatic playoff win over Angel Cabrera of Argentina at Augusta sealed his place in golfing history and he was also in contention at the British Open and U.S. PGA Championships. Scott performed strongly at Kapalua in the Tournament of Champions, tying for sixth, to serve notice he will again be a force in 2014. Lee Chang-Woo . Both the PGA Tour, and in particular the women's LPGA Tour, are becoming accustomed to precocious teenagers from Asia turning up in the United States and making their mark. Last year it was China's 14-year-old Guan Tianglang who had greats like Gary Player singing his praises with his performances at Augusta -- where he made the cut -- and subsequent PGA Tour events. In 2014, South Korean Lee Chang-Woo has the same opportunity after emulating Guan and winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship. That booked a place for the 19-year-year-old at the Masters and also a spot at final qualifying for the British Open. He is likely to grab the opportunities with both hands, having already mixed it with established professionals while still in the unpaid ranks. Seoul-born Lee tied for second with McIlroy at the Korea Open, the week before his Asia-Pacific win, and claimed victory in an earlier Korean Tour event. ""Playing in the Masters has been my dream since I started playing golf,"" he said. ""This is a great honor, I have never been so excited."" Guan could not repeat his heroics of 2012 and finished back in eighth, but Lee was initially challenged in the final round by another young Chinese star, Dou Zecheng, before the 16-year-old fell away on the back nine. The pedigree of the Asia-Pacific Amateur winners is also strong. Since 2009, all but one winner has made the cut at the Masters. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama, a previous qualifier by this route, achieved the feat twice and finished third in the Frys.com Open last October, the opening event on the 2013-14 PGA Tour calendar. Lee will be hoping to make a similar impression to earn sponsor invites for PGA events after the Masters, while Matsuyama has already proved he can mix it with the best while still in the amateur ranks.","Jordan Spieth is considered brightest young prospect on PGA Tour .

"(CNN) -- It is one of the most passionate derbies in world football. Not only do Internazionale and AC Milan share a city, they also share a stadium -- the San Siro -- but as they prepare to meet for the first time this season the notoriously febrile atmosphere this enduring fixture generates might be significantly muted. The Italian authorities have ordered the closure of the Curva Nord section of the stadium, where Inter's most vociferous fan congregate, in response to chanting aimed at Napoli supporters in their game last weekend. Now, in what is Inter's ""home"" game, the Nerazzurri risk being outnumbered by the fans of their bitter rival club. It is the latest in a string of turf war incidents that come under the banner of territorial discrimination, where regional disputes between sets of fans are played out in chants during top-flight matches. While the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) used to hand out hefty fines to deal with such incidents, clubs agreed prior to the start of the season to use the threat of stadium closures in order to tackle the problem head on. Juventus' stadium was partially closed for two Serie A matches earlier this season after their fans sang derogatory chants during a victory over Napoli, prompting an appeal from the club's general manager Beppe Marotta for their supporters to stop bellowing ""self-harming"" songs. Italian football is now locked in a duel fight, to try and combat incidents of racist chanting towards black players that have blighted the game both this season and last, and these long-running spats between different parts of Italy's cities as well as its regions. Italians frequently define themselves by their region and that regionalism is often played out in the nation's football stadiums. And in an interview with CNN World Sport in October, Juve's president Andrea Agnelli said it was vitally important to make a distinction between racism an these regional turf wars. ""Italy is the land of the 1,000 boroughs,"" Agnelli exclusively told CNN. ""There is rivalry between two boroughs that are 50 meters away and they don't talk to each other. ""A lot of what goes under racism in terms of international news is actually territorial discrimination. Is that acceptable? No, but it is completely different to racism. ""It is the same song that has been sung for 25 or 30 years and suddenly what happened in August, the board of the (Italian) federation changed the (punishment) from administrative fines to penalties that led to the closure of a part of the stadium or the stadium itself."" Agnelli argued it was ""nonsense"" that the new edicts had effectively handed too much power to hardcore groups of fans who are usually the protagonists when offensive songs are aired. ""As it stands, it is unreasonable and it obviously gives too much control to the group of hardcore fans; now they have a tool to decide what is going to happen. ""Again, there is that subtle but definitive distinction between racism and typical Italian territorial confrontation. ""It is going to be difficult to (change anything) in the middle of the season because some punishments have already been done."" A group of Inter's fans have also called the closure of the Curva Nord ""nonsensical"" while some say they plan on boycotting the match in response to the league's decision. Stadium closures have become a frequent occurrence over the past few seasons in Italian football, but mostly in response to incidents of a racist nature. The most high profile came in a friendly match between AC Milan and lower league team Pro Patria in January 2013, when AC midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng left the field after being the subject of monkey noises from a section of the home support. Specter of racism . His protest made headlines around the globe and prompted soccer's authorities to confront the ugly specter of racism in football. The game's world governing body FIFA subsequently set up a racism task force that suggested harsher punishments for players or clubs found guilty of discrimination. But still the abuse continued. In May 2013, Boateng -- who now plays for Schalke in Germany -- and teammates Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari were the targets when Milan's clash with Roma was temporarily halted as visiting fans chanted racist abuse at the trio. Agnelli acknowledged there is a problem in Italian football regarding racism and welcomed the tougher stance from the game's ruling bodies but warned it would still take some time before players from different cultures were fully embraced. ""Any form of racism should be fought,"" he said. ""In Italy there is a high degree of attitudes that aren't ready for embracing different cultures and religions. ""I came to high school in England in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and there are things that were said then that were considered normal that would be considered unreasonable now. ""The UK has started much earlier than us in terms of embracing different cultures and regions. ""The UK has always had a much higher percentage of black people in the country so it was much more normal for you. ""We are in the United Kingdom of the 1970s (in Italy) so you have to place things into context. ""If you judge it from a British point of view, what has happened is unacceptable, but you have to understand that you need to take some steps before certain aspects are digested and made familiar and embraced by a population, a culture and a country."" Agnelli says it is hypocritical for clubs to be complaining about the punishments when they voted them through prior to the start of the season. ""Up until last year the same chants were sung and it was an administrative fine, â‚¬20,000 or â‚¬30,000 and nobody cared,"" he said. ""Suddenly, because of these penalties, it came to the news. ""Italy is very peculiar on that front, so you should distinguish between territorial discrimination -- which we are not in favor of -- but it is very different from racism, they are not on the same level. ""The same people who (have been) moaning about it are the same people that in August voted that they were fine with the fines that would be given. ""So there has to be a step up in terms of attention into everything that happens in the governance of football because that was obvious and evident it was coming.""","Part of San Siro stadium shut for the derby between Inter and AC Milan on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- It's happened to the best of us; you've seen an airfare on a travel site and decided to jump on it, only to watch the price plummet weeks later. Or worse, you've sat on it, only to see it leap beyond the reaches of your budget. Such a grating scenario may be a thing of the past, as price predictors are becoming a common feature on booking websites. TheSuitest, a relatively new hotel booking website that not only lists available rooms, but grades the price on an A to F scale, is the latest venture to adopt the software. Last month, it became the first hotel booking site to add price forecasting, adding a function called ""hotel time machine"". The tool analyzes over 10,000 different pricing models to predict whether the price will rise or fall, even providing a percent likelihood. Given the complexity of the algorithm, it should probably come as no surprise that TheSuitest is the brainchild of a former Goldman Sach's analyst. ""I come from an investment finance background, and my job was all about processing large volumes of info and distilling it into something you could make a split-second, actionable decision on,"" says Jeremy Murphy, TheSuitest's CEO and founder. ""We took that mentality and applied it to the website."" Murphy notes that it's only recently a site like his would be able to operate. ""Even a few years ago, it wasn't really practical for a site to collect and process the volume of data that are necessary to do the types of things that we're doing. We're dealing with billions of past prices and have to literally produce a trillion-trillion forecasts,"" he says. Interactive: Which airlines have wi-fi? TheSuitest is one of several sites to jump on the trend. In January, Kayak added a price forecast option to its website, letting guests use it to predict whether an airfare will stay put or take a leap. ""At Kayak, every employee randomly gets assigned user feedback. Enough of us saw users were asking for us to do this that we decided to allow our engineers to experiment,"" explains Giorgos Zacharia, Kayak's chief product officer. Kayak's approach to number-crunching is slightly different, in that the company bases its data on the billion-plus search queries performed by users. ""That's the benefit of our approach: the user does the crowdsourcing for us,"" explains Zacharia. The advantage of Kayak's model is it relies on an enormous amount of data to make predictions. The downfall is that niche destinations (those that aren't searched as often) are often overlooked. ""They're not as accurate, because we don't have enough data on those regions, yet,"" admits Zachaia. Looking to the future . Price forecasters aren't entirely new. Farecast.com brought the feature to the market back in 2005. The company was since bought by Microsoft and rebranded Bing Travel. The forecaster is still very much a part of Bing's model and, unlike at Kayak, it extends to both hotel rooms and airfares, though strictly in the U.S. market. One might imagine that price predictors would make hotels and airlines somewhat nervous. After all, if a deal is rated ""bad"", or an airfare listed as likely to drop, aren't hotels and airlines less likely to sell at a premium price? Murphy says he's found the opposite is true. ""We expected a hostile response from hotels, just because we were shedding light on their pricing policies. We've actually been approached by a lot of big name chains because they see an opportunity to sell people a nicer room."" Read more: Place your bids for business class . In other words, the more expensive rooms that don't necessarily sell as well could in fact be a better deal. Though somewhat in its infancy, forecasting tools are going to become the norm, not just in the travel industry, but across a range or websites, according to travel industry analyst Brian London.

"(CNN) -- It lit up the world and showed us all our way. It served presidents, princes, and paupers with equal alacrity. It brought the writings of Yeats, Joyce, Rowling, and Trudeau to millions of bed-readers, and helped countless people around the world avoid stubbing their toes in the dark. And now, it is no more. Farewell, traditional light bulb. As the clock strikes midnight, the light dims on your reign as the mechanical illuminator of human existence. Rest in peace. This was no sudden death. The diagnosis came in years ago, in 2007, when President George W. Bush signed a law to replace standard incandescents with more efficient bulbs. Much more. Only about 10% of the energy these traditional bulbs use is for light, the Environmental Protection Agency says. Seventy-five- and 100-watt bulbs were already banned this year. The ban on production of 40 and 60-watt bulbs -- the most popular in the country -- kicks in as 2014 begins. ""There are 4 billion light bulb sockets in the U.S. and more than 3 billion of them still use the standard incandescent technology that hasn't changed much in 125 years,"" the EPA says. ""A standard incandescent is only 10% efficient -- the other 90% of the electricity it uses is lost as heat."" It's the dawn of a new day. Taking over the limelight now: halogen bulbs, compact fluorescent bulbs, LED bulbs and high efficiency incandescents. While CNNMoney has covered the business behind all this, as well as the battle over whether it's a sign of too much government meddling, on this New Year's Eve, we're left with the sad sense of saying goodbye to you, sweet standard -- but also the knowledge that your legacy will irradiate our world, brighter than ever. Born in 1803 or later, depending on how you measure it, you, in all your transformational beauty, were raised by more parents than we could name -- Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, William Sawyer, Albon Man, Joseph Swan, and, of course, Thomas Edison, the Energy Department notes. While, unlike President Barack Obama, you have no birth certificate, we will always treasure Edison's patent of you from January 27, 1880. And we find solace in knowing that he just might be glad to see you exit gracefully, making way for the next generation. ""Thomas Edison was a patriot, he was a futurist, and he was green. Edison's concern after the turn of the last century was with pollution and nonrenewable resources, not with freezing technological change at the level of 1879,"" David Edward Edison Sloane, Thomas Edison's great grandson, wrote for CNN.com under the headline, ""Edison would've loved new light bulb law."" Still, some aren't quite as ready to let go. And, in a way, they won't have to. As with all laws, there are some loopholes. Three-way standard incandescent light bulbs will still be made. Yes, we live in an era of space stations, blazing fast computers, and access to just about any piece of information we need. But no one can take away the glory of that click-click-click you give us in our hotel-room lamps. So, for those who just can't quit you yet, some enterprising shop owners have a plan. ""Any regular lamp, you can change it from an on-and-off to a three-way, and we do it for our customers here,"" Doug Satterfield, owner of Rollier's Hardware in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, told CNN affiliate KDKA. But in the not-so-long run, we know, your gleaming presence in our lives is fading. Today's children won't know you as previous generations did. At CNNMoney.com, a commenter calling himself Mudbone Willie posted his concern -- and received hundreds of ""upvotes"" for it. ""Great. I do all of my baking in a small oven that uses a light bulb at its heat source. Now what?"" Worry not, Mudbone Willie. The Easy-Bake oven has changed with the times. ""No more light bulbs needed!"" Hasbro says in its ad for the Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven. As greenbiz.com reported, Hasbro revised its classic in response to the new law. The new lights taking over our lives will surely bring joy and less wasted energy -- perhaps a beautiful new beginning. Still, on two of life's most pressing questions, we remain in the dark: . What will happen when a cartoon character gets a great idea? On this, Fortuna Lee offers some suggestions. And, finally, how many psychiatrists/lawyers/programmers/med students/economists/surrealists will it now take to change a light bulb? Oh, there are new ones that look the same? Problems solved. Here's to you, standard incandescent light bulb. May the fireworks that light up the skies this evening give you the blazing sendoff you deserve.","Standard incandescent light bulbs will no longer be manufactured .

"(CNN) -- For Pieter-Jan Pieters, revenge has been both sweet and sonorous. When music schools refused to admit him because he could not read music, he went to a design school instead — and invented a way to make melodies not only without sheet music, but without traditional instruments either. ""It feels good,"" he says. ""I like playing music, I like doing design and now designing musical instruments and playing your own design — it's kind of the ultimate happiness. In the end everybody can just play music that wants to play music and not have to learn a complex code."" When Pieters enrolled at the Design Academy Eindhoven he began to play around with electronic sensors that would allow musicians to control sound using only the movement of their own bodies. One of his tutors encouraged him to look at the way people move when they dance and incorporate those movements into his design. Read this: Is this the world's weirdest instrument? The result is a collection of five instruments, which Pieters calls Sound on Intuition: . • A sensor that measures the position of the musician's hand, raising and lowering the pitch of the note with the rise and fall of the hand . • A collar that fits around the finger and converts tapping, bending and stretching movements into sound . • A heart rate monitor that produces rhythms based on the beating of the musician's heart . • A strap that wraps around the musician's foot and produces the sound of a bass drum in time with his or her foot-tapping . • A scanner that reads lines or dots drawn by the musician and represents them musically: ""If you want to have a sound that goes up and down,"" Peters says, ""you just draw a line that goes up and down."" Although electronic music is nothing new, Pieters says that abandoning instruments altogether in favor of computer programs can take some of the joy out of making music. ""Now everybody sits behind his computer and just types in commands to create a sound, but it's not that fun anymore,"" he says. ""If we have instruments that you can move and kind of play the computer in a fun way, I think making music is more fun."" Hein Mevissen, a Dutch film director and designer of the radically simple John's Phone, praised the intuitive interface and said that he could imagine the approach spreading to other art forms. ""I really like it,"" he says. ""I think it could be the future in everything, even with computers and with graphic programs, even film. Design is evolution or devolution. Devolving of design is something that I really like — you know, making products simple again."" Mevissen urged Pieters to keep developing and improving his design until it was ready for a wider audience. ""As long as his heart is in it and he keeps his heart in it then he will succeed,"" Mevissen says. Read this: The brave new world of electric paint . Since Pieters had little experience working with electronics, he looked for ways of adapting sensors and other devices that were already on the market -- rather than starting from scratch. He was pleased to see that this adaptive approach was then adopted by the people who used his prototype, some of whom found new and unexpected uses for the device. ""It started as a music instrument project, but when I got to finish it, it opened up a lot more doors,"" he says. ""For example a woman came up to me and she said to me: 'This would be perfect for autistic children. Autistic children would play with this for hours because they'd feel that the instrument understands them and they don't have to learn to play it.'"" For Pieters, that would be the ultimate vindication. The music schools that rejected him may not have seen his potential, but his musical instruments could help other to unleash theirs.","Sound on Intuition by designer Pieter-Jan Pieters turns your body into a musical instrument .
Sensors attach to your hands,feet and heart to produce music that responds to movement .
His creation allows people of any background or skill-base to make music ."
"(CNN) -- A Malaysian court on Friday overturned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's acquittal of the charge that he sodomized a former political aide, the latest twist in a long-running legal battle. Anwar was acquitted of sodomy in January 2012. But the Court of Appeal on Friday ruled that he is guilty, state news agency Bernama reported. Anwar, de facto leader of the People's Justice Party, has repeatedly said he is innocent, calling the case against him an attempt by the government to end his political career -- an assertion it has consistently denied. ""This is a travesty of justice -- a blatant disregard of the rule of law,"" said Azmin Ali, deputy president of the People's Justice Party and a member of parliament. ""This case is a clear case of hurried justice."" When asked if this has anything to do with Malaysia's upcoming elections, Ali didn't hesitate in his response: ""Certainly, they wanted to stop Anwar from contesting."" The previous trial at the Kuala Lumpur High Court lasted nearly two years. Prosecutors alleged that he sodomized the former aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, in June 2008. But a judge found him not guilty, saying it was not safe to rely on DNA evidence that had been cited in the trial. Sodomy, even if consensual, is an offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison in Malaysia. Investigators arrested Anwar in July 2008, four months after a loose coalition of opposition parties that he led won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections. It was the second time in the country's history that the governing party had failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. He was the heir apparent to former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until 1998, when he was sacked and charged with corruption and sodomy. Anwar spent six years in prison after being convicted of corruption charges in 1999 and of sodomy charges involving his wife's former driver in 2000. Malaysia's highest court overturned the sodomy conviction and ordered him released from prison in 2004. However, the corruption verdict was never lifted, barring him from running for political posts until 2008.","The Court of Appeal rules that Anwar Ibrahim is guilty of sodomizing an aide .

"(CNN) -- When you think about the images typically associated with hunger, a recreation of the Mad Hatter's tea party from ""Alice in Wonderland"" might not spring to mind. But one Florida nonprofit is using recreated scenes from popular movies, musicals and TV shows to get people talking about poverty and hunger. The Pensacola group Appetite 4 Life provides food to children, the elderly, people with disabilities and terminally ill patients. Looking for an edgy way to raise awareness about poverty and hunger in the local community, the group turned to CNN iReporter James Amerson, a photographer and long-time friend of many of the board members of the nonprofit. Amerson conceptualized the community art project Appetite 4 ART, which combines food with images of iconic films, musicals and TV shows to get people talking about hunger and poverty. Images like Marie Antoinette savagely biting into a blood-red slice of red velvet or Marilyn Monroe trying to hold down a white dress of splashing milk are meant to provoke people to question the message behind them, said Amerson, who served as creative director. ""I want the images to first seem obvious, but then get the viewer to stop and take a second, deeper look to connect the purpose behind the photos,"" he said. Amerson was inspired by the global art project ""Inside Out"" started by Parisian photographer JR, who wanted to get people talking about social issues like poverty, hunger and homelessness through large wall postings. With a grant from the Great Gulfcoast Arts Festival, Amerson and a small group of volunteer photographers and models were able to afford the props, food, sets and printing costs needed to create the images of lavish decadence. The shoots took several weeks to organize and produce. They mostly chose scenes from films that already had food in them, but took creative license with the images inspired by ""American Beauty,"" ""Dexter"" and ""The Seven Year Itch."" The collection isn't intended to portray hunger, he said, but to raise awareness about the organization's efforts. The pictures will be displayed on the side of the Appetite 4 Life building in early April for four weeks before they travel to local galleries, starting with the Anna Lamar Center for Visual Arts at Pensacola State College. While the images are meant to raise awareness more than money, Appetite 4 Life has received offers from people interested in buying the photos. The organization is considering making the images available to purchase, with all of the proceeds going to support the organization. Bill Shore, founder and CEO of the national hunger nonprofit Share Our Strength, said organizations need to get creative to get people to pay attention to hunger and poverty, perennial issues. ""Data speaks to a person's mind; emotion speaks to their heart,"" Shore said. ""Creativity is the bridge between the two. The more creative the communication, the more likely people will notice and be willing to give of themselves.""","Community art project combines food with iconic film images to start discussion about hunger .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Conrad Murray, who literally sang his innocence in a jail cell interview with CNN in April, has given his first interviews since spending two years in jail for the death of Michael Jackson. Australia's ""60 Minutes"" promoted a video interview with Murray to air Sunday, while London's Daily Mail newspaper published a print interview. ""I did not kill Michael Jackson,"" Murray told the Mail. ""He was a drug addict. Michael Jackson accidentally killed Michael Jackson."" The cardiologist said he found Jackson to be ""in crisis at the end of his life, filled with panic and misery"" as he prepared for his comeback concerts in 2009. ""By the end Michael Jackson was a broken man,"" he told the newspaper. ""I tried to protect him but instead I was brought down with him."" His claims are similar to what he told CNN in two separate interviews earlier this year. ""Why am I innocent? Because I did nothing wrong, and all I tried to do was to help a friend who I encountered in a devastated state. And I tried to do everything possible to help my friend,"" Murray told CNN's Don Lemon. Conrad Murray completes jail time for killing Michael Jackson . Murray told Lemon he is a scapegoat who had the bad luck of being ""in the wrong place at the wrong time."" When Murray called in to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" from his jail cell phone for a live interview on April 2, he serenaded Cooper with a sad Nat King Cole Christmas song that he said ""tells my story."" ""He is a little boy that Santa Claus forgot, and goodness knows, he did not want a lot. He wrote a note to Santa for some crayons and a toy. It broke his little heart when he found Santa hadn't come. In the streets, he envied all the lucky boys, but goodness knows, he didn't want a lot. I'm so sorry for that laddie who hasn't got a daddy. He's a little boy that Santa Claus forgot."" ""That song tells my story,"" Murray then said. ""That's how I grew up. I had no toy. I had nothing. As I grew up, my heart has been whole and my heart says to help, and all I do is to give. I want to give."" Conrad Murray from jail: 'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time' Sunday's newspaper interview gets into too-much-information territory, with Murray revealing intimate details of his nightly treatments of Jackson. ""You want to know how close we were? I held his penis every night to fit a catheter because he was incontinent at night,"" he said. A jury concluded after a two-month trial in 2011 that Murray's negligence led to Jackson's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. Murray told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his intractable insomnia for two months, so he could rest for rehearsals. Prosecutors argued that Murray's negligence included leaving Jackson unmonitored and unattended while the powerful anesthetic was flowing into his vein through an IV drip. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, arguing for the maximum four years in jail, said Murray was ""playing Russian roulette with Michael Jackson's life every single night,"" by using propofol to put him to sleep in ""a reckless, obscene manner."" Murray's lawyers unsuccessfully argued that Jackson self-administered the drug while Murray was out of his bedroom. His appeal of the conviction is still pending in a California court.","London's Daily Mail and Australia's ""60 MInutes"" interview Conrad Murray .

"(CNN) -- William Spengler had killed before. The first time, presumably, was in 1980. Then about 40 years old, Spengler struck his grandmother with a hammer. A year later, he was convicted of first-degree manslaughter in her death. Flash forward to before dawn Monday, in Webster, New York, a town of about 43,000 people located 10 miles east of Rochester. That's when and where, Police Chief Gerald Pickering said, Spengler presumably set his and his sister's home ablaze, lugged weapons up a hill, then waited. When local firefighters arrived at the scene, Spengler fired and killed again. 'Chaos': Gunman ambushes, kills 2 firefighters . Authorities haven't given a motive for the latest violence, which left two firefighters dead and two other firefighters and an off-duty police officer from a nearby town wounded. And they can't ask the shooter, who was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head around 11 a.m., about six hours after first calls about the fire came in. But the Webster police chief has his own idea about why this happened. ""Just looking at the history, obviously this is an individual who had a lot of problems, to kill his grandmother,"" Pickering said. ""And I'm sure there were ... mental health issues involved."" After his 1981 manslaughter conviction, Spengler was given an indeterminate sentence, said Monroe County District Attorney Sandra Doorley. He ended up spending nearly 18 years behind bars until his release in 1998. Through 2006, Spengler was on supervised parole, during which time Doorley said she wasn't aware of any events suggesting he had gotten into further trouble. Nor, Pickering said, had police had any ""contact with him criminally"" in the recent past. Until Monday. By then, Spengler was living in a home in Webster, likely with his sister, who was still unaccounted for Monday afternoon. Their mother had died sometime in the past year, according to Pickering. He'd accumulated weapons, bringing ""several different types"" with him before the shootings, the police chief said. It is not known how he obtained these firearms, but ex-felons are not allowed to possess weapons. But because Spengler had them, two families are in mourning. Many of his former neighbors are homeless, because having a gunman on the loose slowed fire crews' efforts to corral a blaze that eventually destroyed seven homes. ""It's Christmas Eve. This is a day where people are getting together to celebrate a holiday,"" Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy told reporters in Webster. ""This tragedy is just unthinkable and unspeakable.""","William Spengler killed his grandmother with a hammer in 1980 .

"(CNN) -- This holiday season, an ad campaign is selling clothes and challenging bigotry in America. A poster of a turbaned and bearded man in Gap clothes with a woman hanging on his shoulder hit store windows and subway walls across the United States last month as part of Gap's ""Make Love"" ad campaign. The model is Waris Ahluwalia, a Sikh actor whose turban and beard is part of his faith. For the first time, a mainstream, nationwide ad presents a turbaned man as beautiful, even sexy. He is not a suspect, but a model; not a terrorist, but a person with dignity; not a foreigner, but an American. The ad thrilled Sikh Americans like me, who have worked for years to dismantle one of the most pernicious prevailing stereotypes in American culture: turban equals terrorist. Nearly every person who wears a turban in the United States is Sikh. Many Sikhs wear five articles of faith, including kesh, long uncut hair that most men and some women wrap in a cloth turban. Tragically, the turban meant to represent a commitment to service and justice marked Sikh Americans as targets of hate. Recently, the ad featuring Waris Ahluwalia was found covered with racist graffiti on a New York City subway wall. ""Make Love"" was crossed out to read ""Make Bombs."" Someone scrawled beneath it, ""Please stop driving TAXIS."" The racial epithets were familiar, but what happened next was altogether new. The photograph went viral on Twitter. Within 24 hours, Gap set out to replace the defaced ads, made the ad its background image on Twitter and Facebook and released the statement, ""Gap is a brand that celebrates inclusion and diversity."" The company's response set off a chorus of #ThankYouGap posts. The story is a powerful example of how a groundswell of people can ""make love"" in response to hate. It's a story we need now more than ever. Twelve years after September 11, 2001, the stereotype of the turbaned and bearded terrorist is deeply entrenched in our social imagination. It shows up in profiling at airports, bullying in the school yard, violence on the streets, surveillance of houses of worship, and yes, graffiti on a New York City subway wall. In daily encounters, our minds default to stereotypes we have unwittingly absorbed. The most dangerous racial stereotypes trigger fear and animosity -- for example, African-Americans as ""criminal,"" Latinos as ""illegal,"" or Muslims and Sikhs as ""terrorist."" Once a person is reduced to a stereotype, it becomes easier to harm them, or to permit harm to be done to them. But there is a powerful antidote to these stereotypes: the diversity of faces, voices and stories of real people that show our shared humanity. In the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting in a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, thousands of people wrote heartfelt letters in an outpouring of love and support to families who lost loved ones and signed petitions that led to a new government policy to track hate crimes against Sikhs. This fall, after Columbia University professor Prabhjot Singh was brutally beaten in New York City, nearly 4,000 people of different faiths sent him prayers and messages online. And 11 days ago, when photographer Robert Gerhardt, a white Catholic, saw racist graffiti covering a photograph of a Sikh, he chose to take a photograph of the ad. He sent the photo to Muslim American writer Arsalan Iftikhar, who decided to post it on Twitter. Others shared the photo, which prompted Gap to take a public stand. Earlier this month, Gap employee Casey David Muir-Taylor made the same choice when an irate customer complained about the Muslim ""terrorist"" in the ""do-rag."" He defended the ad and posted about it on Facebook. Each of these individuals chose to fight for a community not their own. As a Sikh American, these acts of courage deepen my commitment to do the same for others. Companies should take note that taking a public stand against hate wins new customers. But it would be a mistake to miss the deeper lesson: We as individuals can no longer claim helplessness in the face of racism. In the digital era, the power to ""make love,"" not bigotry, lies in the palm of our hands. Whether in response to a Sikh model in a fashion ad, or a South Asian American woman crowned Ms. America, new media give a new generation a chance to speak out for our vision of America. The key is using our power to dismantle the stereotypes that shape our social landscape. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Valarie Kaur.","Gap ad featuring Sikh designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia was defaced .

"Seaside Park, New Jersey (CNN) -- John Sundermann was en route to his store, Big Hearted John's, on Thursday when his son called from the shop and said, ""Dad, there's a fire. There's a lot of smoke coming in."" Sundermann wasn't concerned at first about his shop in Seaside Heights. The fire was down the beach, not much of a threat. He didn't count on a 20- to 25-mph wind carrying the flames four blocks up the boardwalk from neighboring Seaside Park, consuming a massive swath of the pathway freshly rebuilt after Superstorm Sandy struck last year. Sandy hammered Big Hearted John's, and Sundermann had reopened his doors on July 3, just in time for Independence Day celebrations. He was looking forward to keeping the store open another weekend, he said. Sundermann hadn't seen the damage to his store when he spoke to CNN on Friday, but he got close enough to see firefighters spraying water cannons through the side door of the store, packed with clothes and beach sundries. ""I'm sure that's all messed up. I'm just worried to see if the roof is intact. That's the new front door, the 30-foot steel door we put up in the front. That's gone. So, we'll see what's going on,"" he said, adding that on the bright side, ""At least I'm healthy and nobody got hurt."" The boardwalk was reparable after Sandy wrecked it in October, but it took hundreds of firefighters nine hours to get the fire under control by Thursday night. About 100 firefighters were still on the scene early Friday, handling various hot spots and mopping up, said Ocean County Fire Administrator Brian Gabriel. There were no civilian injuries and ""one, maybe two very, very minor firefighter injuries,"" he said. Gov. Chris Christie said during a news conference that there are reports that two or three police officers suffered head injuries after falling off a fire vehicle. ""They've been taken to a trauma unit, and as soon as we have more information on them, we'll share that with you,"" he said. Dozens of businesses were destroyed in the fire, Christie said. Officials earlier noted that other structures were damaged when winds carried embers from the ice cream shop where they believe the fire started up the boardwalk to a nearby condominium complex, pier and an arcade, city and county officials said. Those later blazes were contained. There was a firefighter convention in Wildwood, 90 miles south, at the time, so roughly 400 firefighters from 30 towns -- many of them volunteer units -- were able to respond, said Seaside Heights Mayor Bill Akers. Had they not been nearby, the damage could have extended beyond six blocks of boardwalk in Seaside Park and two blocks in Seaside Heights, he said, estimating that reconstruction costs will reach the millions. ""We're just so grateful for what these gentlemen do every single day, putting their lives on the line to save life and property, in other communities, not just their own,"" Akers said. Upon first seeing the damage Thursday, Christie said, ""I feel like I want to throw up."" He added, ""After all the effort and time and resources that we've put in to help the folks in Seaside Park and Seaside Heights rebuild. To see this going on ... is just unthinkable."" The Seaside Heights boardwalk was in the public eye shortly after Superstorm Sandy blew its famous Jet Star roller coaster into the water last year. The coaster was removed from the ocean in May, shortly before the boardwalk reopened for business. On Thursday, firefighters ripped out the boardwalk at Lincoln Avenue in time to create a fire line that saved much of Seaside Heights from the fate that imperiled neighboring Seaside Park. They dug a 20-foot trench where the street met the boardwalk to keep the brisk winds from further spreading the flames, Christie said Thursday. ""The destruction south of Lincoln Avenue, it's complete,"" he said. Town officials plan to meet with business owners and help them rebuild, said Seaside Park Town Administrator Robert Martucci. Akers added that the town will also assess the damage. ""If there's a silver lining, we just built it. We have the specs. We know what we're doing,"" the mayor said. ""We'll get it back up."" Sundermann's son, Jake, probably summed up the sentiments of business owners affected by the fire when he said he was distraught ""after walking up here after Sandy and seeing homes, buildings, everything just flooded, torn -- everything with sand. And all of a sudden, everyone rebuilds, and not even a year later, it all burns."" His father, though, said the response to Sandy gave him optimism. ""I'm not ever going to get used to it, but I've dealt with it before. I didn't have that kind of hopeless feeling I had after the storm,"" he said. ""Now I know that things can be done and we'll get back together and get it open."" Authorities are not sure what caused the fire, but Martucci said it started at Kohr Brothers Frozen Custard shop on the FunTown Amusement Pier about 2:15 p.m. Martucci was at a meeting at town offices across the street when it began. The fire escalated to six alarms shortly before 4 p.m. ET. Sandy destroyed the FunTown Pier, which had been partially reopened this summer. The storm also damaged local water systems, and firefighters struggled with the supply Thursday, Christie said. They had to tap into Barnegat Bay seawater to extinguish the flames.

"(CNN) -- Britain's Lewis Hamilton led a Mercedes one-two at the Chinese Grand Prix Sunday as his teammate Nico Rosberg clung on to his lead in the F1 world championship title race. It was the third straight victory for Hamilton after his retirement in the opening round in Australia and he led for every one of the 56 laps in Shanghai after starting from pole position. By contrast, Rosberg had to battle through the field after a wretched start and only overhauled Fernando Alonso in his Ferrari after the final round of pit stops. Read more: CNN's essential guide to F1 in 2014 . Rosberg, who won in Australia, has a four-point lead over Hamilton after four rounds of the 2014 season, which is being dominated by their all-conquering Mercedes team. Alonso's third was a rare bright spot in a difficult season for Ferrari, whose team boss Stefano Domenicali quit earlier this week, but it was a frustrating afternoon for Red Bull and defending four-time champion Sebastian Vettel. The German had to give best to his rookie teammate Daniel Ricciardo in the battle for a distant fourth after initially running in second following a fine start. Vettel also appeared to disregard team orders after being told to let Australia's Ricciardo past. ""Tough luck"" came the reply over race radio, but he did move over shortly afterwards.

Hamilton was involved in an epic battle with Rosberg in Bahrain, but spent much of the latest race in splendid isolation, finishing over 18 seconds clear as he took the checkered flag. ""It's incredible, I just can't believe how amazing this car is,"" the 2008 world champion said in his post-race podium interview. ""I was just really racing myself,"" he added. Two-time champion Alonso was delighted to have edged ahead of the two Red Bulls after the ructions within his team which have seen Domenicali replaced by Marco Mattiacci. ""It was a good weekend, we improved the car and were more competitive,"" he said. ""We've not had the start to the season we would have liked, but we are still in the fight,"" added the Spaniard. Nico Hulkenberg was sixth for Force India, just holding off Finn Valtteri Bottas in his Williams. Bottas and Rosberg made heavy contact on the first corner but both were able to continue unhindered. ""There were cars all over the place and it was great my car held on,"" a relieved Rosberg said. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, Sergio Perez in the second Force India and youngster Daniil Kvyat in a Toro Rosso completed the points scoring positions. Read more: Why can't women win in F1?

"(CNN) -- ""Everything seems sexier in Paris,"" muses New Yorker Alison Drew, who recently returned from an unforgettable romantic escape. ""Just walking around makes you want to be in love."" Paris has proved itself irresistible to Travel + Leisure readers as well, who again rated it No. 1 for romance in the latest World's Best Awards survey. For some cities, setting the stage for love seems second nature. The 18th-annual awards revealed destinations for that perfect romantic getaway closer to home as well, like California's quaint seaside village of Carmel (No. 3) with its storybook cottages, sheep meadows and rugged coastal views. Be it a gorgeous cityscape, an overflow of culture, or pastries that make your heart sing, the world's most romantic cities offer plenty to love, whether you've found a match or are merely looking to let some sparks fly. No. 1 Paris . For both art lovers and lover lovers, ranking the City of Light as the best in the world in both categories may sound cliché, but the heart wants what the heart wants (and is always right). Walks along the Seine, tree-lined boulevards and cobbled lanes, a swoony stop at the Musée Rodin, or a simple glass of red in a cozy bistro all add to l'amour Parisienne. Don't miss: The picnic-perfect Place des Vosges, one of Paris's oldest and most beautiful squares, surrounded by elegant 17th-century mansions in the Marais quarter. No. 2 Venice . Although Venice ranked No. 25 overall this year, the City of Water rises toward the top of the world's best cities when it comes to love -- and it's easy to see why. Its hidden bridges, cobblestoned alleyways and iconic canals are perfect for getting lost in with a partner. Stroll the palaces and piazzas, explore the ancient architecture and while away the day in chic boutiques, art galleries and canal-side cafés. Don't miss: The legendary grandeur of Hotel Cipriani (Europe's No. 5 small city hotel) on serene Giudecca Island, offering balcony views of St. Mark's Square and a private wooden boat for traversing the lagoon. Travel + Leisure: America's best new romantic restaurants . No. 3 Carmel, California . Storybook cottages, quaint shops, art galleries and inviting eateries in this quaint seaside village abut one of northern California's most spectacular swaths of sand. Amble along the cypress-fringed path overlooking the rugged coast or cuddle on a bench and gaze out on the Pacific. Wine-tasting in nearby Carmel Valley, Pebble Beach's scenic 17-mile drive and the redwood-laden road to Big Sur only heighten the romance factor. Don't miss:: A glass of wine on the patio of Clint Eastwood's Mission Ranch, with rolling sheep meadows and sparkling sea vistas, before dinner at L'Auberge Carmel's cozy Aubergine restaurant, helmed by one of Food & Wine's Best New Chefs of 2013, Justin Cogley. No. 4 Florence . With its red-roofed buildings along the Arno backed by rolling hills, it's no wonder this Renaissance city leaves visitors love-struck. Art lovers fall for Florence's classic architecture and masterful Michelangelos, while foodies adore the authentic Tuscan cuisine and stone's-throw jaunts to the Chianti countryside. Don't miss: Jaw-dropping skyline vistas from the Giardini Bardini, or essential souvenir shopping in the charming Oltrarno quarter, with its artisan workshops and small boutiques.

Couples can snorkel the calm shores of Hanauma Bay Beach; hike to the top of Diamond Head Crater for stellar sea and Waikiki views; then hit the town for a date night of Pacific Rim cuisine. Don't miss: A stay at the posh Halekulani, a five-acre resort with tropical grounds fronting Waikiki Beach, or Sunday brunch at its open-air Orchids restaurant, where Hawaiian specialties come with views of Diamond Head. No. 6 Quebec City, Canada . Set on the banks of the Saint Lawrence River, Quebec may be one of the oldest cities in North America but the French appeal of this capital -- which jumped up this year from No. 11 -- never gets old. Stroll the historic quarter's narrow cobbled lanes, where centuries-old stone buildings house antique shops, museums and sidewalk cafés in an almost fairy-tale European-like setting. Don't miss: Parc Linéaire, a weave of walking trails along the St. Charles River that lead to lush gardens, canyons and waterfalls. Travel + Leisure: America's most romantic towns . No. 7 San Francisco . While San Francisco scored high marks for food (No. 2 in the world), trendsetting eateries are only one ingredient in the City by the Bay's allure -- as are Napa-Sonoma's wine country an hour north. Couples with a penchant for kissable selfies have a multitude of worthy backdrops, from colorful Victorian row houses to Art Deco mansions, hilly bohemian-chic neighborhoods and rugged natural vistas out over the (often fog-shrouded) bay. Don't miss: The storybook town of Tiburon, where twosomes can picnic on the sprawling grassy waterfront, hike to 360-degree panoramas of the San Francisco skyline or bike along the banks of the shimmering bay. No. 8 Rome . Romance is undeniably a part of Rome's heritage -- it's not nicknamed the Eternal City for nothing -- with its epic monuments, baroque churches and medieval ruins vying with charming trattorias for your attention. Few pleasures come close to grabbing a table for two by a millennia-old fountain, sipping a cappuccino and soaking it all in. Don't miss: A romantic walk over cobblestones on the 2,300-year-old Appian Way, past Roman countryside, ancient statues and imperial palaces. No. 9 Cape Town . Framed by the dramatic Table Mountain ridge and breathtaking seascapes, Cape Town is arguably South Africa's most beautiful city, where markets and colonial-era cottages meet the modern metropolis. You can wander the local art galleries or take a short drive through the rolling-hilled Winelands and get a flavor for the region's burgeoning farm-to-table fare. Sun-seekers can also find a secluded spot on Camps Bay's white-sand beaches. Don't miss: A sumptuous room with service to match at Cape Grace, a luxurious hideaway set on its own private quay on the V&A Waterfront. No. 10 Charleston, South Carolina .

"(CNN) -- Arriving at an air terminal is rarely a memorable event. All the more reason to book a flight touching down at one of these hairy or awesome air strips. Princess Juliana International Airport, St. Maarten, Caribbean . Vacationers flock to the Caribbean for a laid-back vacation. But arriving at the region's airports can have the opposite effect -- the compact, rugged nature of many of the islands forces runways to be built in inventive locations. Perhaps everything feels all the more serene after landing. On St. Maarten, Princess Juliana Airport -- named after Dutch royalty -- has people gnawing their fingernails in the air and on the ground whenever a plane lands. The runway starts mere meters from the edge of the ocean, with aircraft coming in almost low enough over the beach to spike a volleyball set. More: Breathtaking photos of Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport's glory days . Courchevel Altiport, France . Unlike Caribbean-bound passengers, skiers and snowboarders touching down at Courchevel are usually geared up for an adrenaline fix. They'd better be. In winter, the tarmac air strip at the French resort's altiport, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, is often the only thing not covered in snow. Aircraft fly in through a channel between mountains, landing on a short, steeply sloping runway, complete with vertical drop off, that could almost double as a ski jump. The scene is so dramatic it was featured as a stunt location in the James Bond movie ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" (Editor's note: We initially referred to an incorrect Bond film ""Goldeneye."") Matekane Air Strip, Lesotho . There's little chance of extending this runway very far -- it ends abruptly at the edge of a 600-meter drop. Only light aircraft use the airstrip on this remote tabletop plateau in the tiny southern African kingdom. Planes sometimes fail to ascend at the end of the runway, conjuring images of a Wile E. Coyote hover and fall (before, thankfully, achieving flying speed and soaring away). More on CNN: Best in airport food and drink . Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport, Saba, Caribbean . Rivaling St. Maarten for Caribbean airport thrills, Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport, on the island of Saba, has one of the world's shortest landing strips. Wedged on a rocky outcrop at the foot of a mountain and with the end of the tarmac plunging into the sea, touchdown here is a dramatic experience. Gibraltar International Airport . Flying toward a gigantic limestone monolith on a landing approach is never easy on the nerves, but in the 6.2-square-kilometer British overseas territory of Gibraltar there's nowhere else to put an airport except in the shadow of the Rock. Space is so limited on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula that the runway bisects the territory's main highway. As aircraft get priority over automobiles in the vehicular pecking order, the road is closed every time a plane takes off or arrives. Barra International Airport, Outer Hebrides, Scotland . Where else in the world can you pick cockles on a runway? Rather than think about where to build a tarmac airstrip when you're short on space, the Outer Hebridean island of Barra took a different approach -- it didn't bother with one. Pilots wait until the tide is out and then land on the beach -- reportedly the only airport in the world where scheduled flights touch down on sand. In between flights to and from Glasgow, the public have open access to the beach/runway. Paro Airport, Bhutan . If there were awards for remote airways surrounded by dramatic scenery, the Himalayas would be filling a shelf. In pride of place might stand the only international airport in the mountainous kingdom of Bhutan . Descending into a narrow, high-altitude bowl amid 6,000-meter peaks, pilots -- who have to be specially trained to land here -- bank their jets in a sharp right turn before swooping in low over farm houses. More on CNN: World's busiest airport . Kansai International Airport, Osaka, Japan . Landing on an aircraft carrier looks thrilling, but you usually have to join the armed services to do it. You can experience a good second best at Japan's Kansai International Airport, where the two runways appear to float on the water way out in Osaka Bay. Actually located on a purpose-built artificial island, to minimize noise pollution for city residents, the runways are in fact sizeable affairs (both more than three kilometers long) and connected to the mainland by a four-kilometer bridge. But from the air, this is the best way to get that ""Top Gun"" feeling on a commercial carrier. Harstad Airport/Narvik, Norway . On the approach to Harstad/Narvik Airport in the region of Evenes, planes skirt through fjord-land, over frozen lakes and between snow-covered mountains. Arriving at the settlement of Hammerfest, in the country's extreme northeast, feels like touching down on an ice rink at certain times of the year. Madeira Airport, Funchal, Portugal . Madeira's international airport looks as if it's been cheating in a tricky-runway competition. Sandwiched between a steep hillside and the sea, its dramatically short tarmac strip is extended on stilts over the water to make it long enough for a safe touchdown. Throw in frequent Atlantic turbulence and you've got an arrival dramatic enough to make the calmest passenger reach for the fortified wine. Malé Airport, Maldives . Malé Airport has looks and drama. Built on its very own atoll, Hulhulé, the runway is a mere six feet feet above sea level. After descending over the 26-island Maldives archipelago, undercarriages feel so close to the sea on touchdown it's as if they're skimming along the water. Ever landed at one of these airports? Know of one that should be on our list? Leave a comment below.","Planes landing on St. Maarten fly so low they risk intercepting volleyballs on the beach .

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- In the months leading up to the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics the story of Sochi, the stage for one of the world's biggest sporting extravaganzas, has evolved into a distinctly negative narrative: security threats, gay-rights protests and corruption allegations. Security because areas such as Chechnya, Dagestan and Georgia -- all nations close to Sochi's location on the north coast of the Black Sea -- have ongoing issues with Russia that have a history of violence. Two recent bombings in Volgograd, and reports of suicide bombers dubbed ""black widows"" in operation, prompted the U.S. government to say it viewed the Games as an ""attractive target for terrorists."" Gay rights because Russia's government banned what it defined as ""gay propaganda"" in 2013, a move that has seen widespread criticism from competing athletes and areas of the international media, and has led to some high-profile politicians refusing to attend. Detractors argue such laws fly in the face of the Olympics charter, which states the Games, like sport itself, should be available to all, regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation and free of discrimination. And corruption because the Games have cost more than $50 billion according to some sources, more than any other in history, and have been funded against a backdrop of criticism from opposition groups. Former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov has complained of ""embezzlement and kick backs"" and questioned where $20-30 billion has been spent. But there is another narrative that is worthy of reflection: Russia's attempts to forge a new identity on the international landscape through sport, and from this point of view first impressions count. Security . Without wanting to pretend to be authoritative on an area with next-to-zero expertise, anecdotally the security seems impressive. As with London 2012, all entry to Olympic venues require an airport-style security check and X-ray as well as a barcode scan of your ticket before gaining access. Police are at all major sites in good numbers, along all major roads traveled thus far, and are supported by military personnel as well. Vehicle searches are thorough and mandatory for entry into International Olympic Commission (IOC) managed territories, even freeways have security atop embankments and escarpments monitoring the traffic drive past. The much touted ""Ring of Steel,"" on the face of it at least, is in place and high profile. Venues . My visit to Sochi's coastal cluster awaits, but the mountain facilities witnessed so far proved awesome in the true sense of the word. A ski jump whose start point seems to scratch the sky such is the way that it's perched on, and protrudes from, the mountainside; cable cars that criss-cross spectators across the epic crevasses below; huge seating galleries and bleachers, erected on the angled ground with a complex mesh of scaffolding and ingenuity; slopes and slideways of the Alpine Center and Sanki Center (race locations for the downhill skiing-type events and bobsleigh-type events respectively) that carve smooth pathways down the otherwise unpredictable surfaces; they are fantastic stages for sporting competition. Accommodation . First impressions of the accommodation has broadly not been good, an assessment which, in large part, has been formed by the unpreparedness of hotels set aside for media. Journalists are known to be a vainglorious lot but there is a serious point here that rooms booked for large expense, months in advance, are not ready and their state was not communicated well to those affected. At worst this could test the claim of IOC president Thomas Bach that all but 3% of rooms are ready. It raises fears of spectators who are traveling from far and wide that they could be left out in the cold. At best it's something of a PR disaster. Frustrating those with the loudest mouths is an early own-goal to concede and one that London, which contended with its own doom-mongers ahead of the 2012 opening ceremony, avoided with aplomb. Transport . The ""World's Most Expensive Road"" has had its detractors -- the joke doing the rounds is that it would have been cheaper to lay caviar as a surface than the Tarmac used. But the estimated $8.6 billion cost for less than 30 miles aside, the road -- as well as the railway that runs parallel to it -- is nothing short of an engineering marvel. The dual carriageway cuts a path from the pleasant climes of the coastal Olympic Park through the vertiginous slopes of the Caucasus mountains, boring through the hard rock of any peak that had the temerity to stand in its path and traversing rock-strewn, river-chiseled chasms with a nonchalance only construction ambition on a grand scale can pull off. The tunnels are many, the steel bridges are myriad and concrete supports and structures, which hold the transport arteries in the air, creep up the snow-capped slopes like a giant, monolithic ivy. The buses, across the IOC zone, are plentiful and regular too. Cost . The investment from the Russian government to make the Games a reality is reputed to have risen above $50 billion and by anyone's standards, bar maybe a politician called Putin, that's a number beyond imagination or moral reckoning. Could such an expenditure ever be justified? Well, before any judgment, it should at least be considered that Sochi is very different to the Vancouver, Turin or even London scenario. The coastal cluster -- actually situated in the town of Adler, a few miles south of Sochi -- now boasts world-class, design-led arenas, a spectacular media center, new hotels as well as new train links and stations. But it's in the mountains where the true scope of the project is revealed. It's fair to say that many Olympic locations in the Krasnaya Polyana region, such as the athletes' village, the Gorki media center and the resort of Rosa Khutor, more closely resemble new towns than alpine sporting facilities. Russian officials claim the sporting cost of the Games is $6.4 billion, and the vast outlay on transport links, power supplies and sewerage should be seen as regional development and not included in the headline budget. The viability of its legacy will be a story for another day. The intangible vibe . One of the most striking memories of the London 2012 experience was the feelgood factor created by an army of volunteers who turned out in their droves to help the Olympic effort prove a success. Sochi looks well-placed to continue this momentum. Many of the temporary workforce, clad in rainbow-colored 2014 Games-themed mountain apparel, stand outside for much of the day -- braving freezing temperatures -- so they can show the way to those who are lost, give advice to those confused and to make the travel-weary feel welcome. Their English skills and enthusiasm has already left an impression, from the night-shift volunteer who helped with bag check-in at Moscow airport to the man who helped explain the bus timetable and pickup points to this befuddled writer. From the students keen to take part in an event that could shape their future to those who have taken the opportunity to work in the new jobs created, there is a sense of excitement and pride. Russia, a country notorious for its autocratic government and stone-faced expressions, has historically driven fear and paranoia in many Western nations. Hosting the Winter Games is a grand welcome to the world to learn more about its culture and people, or to witness its grandstanding depending on your stance, a move that in itself is fascinating.","Sochi buildup has been negative: security threats, gay-rights protests, corruption claims .

"(CNN) -- She's been dubbed the Russian ""Tsarina,"" a former circuit-board-equipment seller who happened to sit next to one of the world's richest business moguls on a plane -- and now heads his company. Meet Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the chairperson of French commodities giant Louis Dreyfus Holdings, with a net worth estimated at an eye-watering $6 billion according to Forbes. Orphaned at seven after her parents died in a train accident, Louis-Dreyfus was raised by her grandfather in what was then the Soviet Union, studying law at Moscow State University. She met her future husband, billionaire Robert Louis-Dreyfus, on a plane in 1988. When he died from leukemia two decades later, the mother of three was left in charge of one of the biggest commodity companies on the planet, as well as the French football club Olympique de Marseille. You might not recognize the 160-year-old Louis Dreyfus firm, but it's the one trading 70 million tonnes of agricultural goods each year, employing 30,000 people. And since 1851 it's been handed down from one male heir to another -- until now. Margarita Louis-Dreyfus sat down with CNN's Leading Women to talk about the act of ""fate"" that sat her next to her future husband, how his illness taught her to manage ""big egos,"" and her plans for a company which claims to feed and clothe 500 million people worldwide. ""My memories of growing up in St Petersburg are very positive. I grew up without parents, but with my grandfather. But I didn't feel that I was really abandoned -- I had enough love from him. During the week I was in the boarding school and when I came home every weekend I had fun with my friends. I was not cold in winter -- I'm telling you this because many people expected that I suffered from hunger. The Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s was OK. Of course I didn't have the luxury that children have today, but I had freedom. I had time to read which was very important generally for Russian children. It gave me a sense of the wide world and gave me a wish to see the world."" ""I met Robert on the plane on the way from Zurich to New York. We made a stop in London where he had just started his job as CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi and I was going on vacation to Switzerland from New York. We met shortly on the plane, a short conversation, and after this when I came back from vacation we met again. He was coming to Switzerland every weekend because his dog was here. The plane was empty and the computer put us together and I was wondering why...but it was kind of fate."" ""The moment I gave birth to the twins I learned Robert had leukemia. So nobody can live a normal life anymore. I had been a housewife up until the birth of the twins. Then came this big sickness that changed our lives completely. And we couldn't have a normal family vacation where everybody was happy and everybody was running around. The sickness was always there and we were traveling to different doctors But we had many hopes that he would still have many more years."" ""The medical world is also a man's world. In the three years of fighting for Robert's life I had to unite five big professors from around the world at one table. Each of them had different ideas and different strategies and were used to their decision being followed. So for me, I felt the strength of the woman. Because all of these men, they have big egos and I was kind of there to absorb these egos, give them the feeling of respecting their opinion -- even if you don't take it. Later when I came to the man's world of commodities, also with big egos, I was used this experience. Nobody knows everything so the main thing is to work together."" ""The Louis Dreyfus Foundation has a focus on giving back. It's a new project for us, it's now one-year-old and the whole idea was about education. For example in Israel, the youth orchestra includes Arabic children together with Jewish children who are learning through music how to love together. You know 'education' is a magic word. And this magic word also becomes important in our foundation -- educating the farmers on how to produce sustainably and to feed themselves.""","Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is in the top 200 billionaires on the planet.

"(CNN) -- Watching digital artist Kyle Lambert's stunning photo-realistic iPad paintings emerge from a blank screen is an awe-inspiring experience. The image of Morgan Freeman in the video above, created from a picture by Scott Gries, is so rich in detail that it is difficult to believe that you aren't looking at a photograph. Difficult until you see the brush strokes build from a blank canvas and turn into the Oscar-nominated actor before your very eyes. Lambert is a UK-based visual artist who specializes in creating visually striking paintings and illustrations for film, television, advertising and print. Lambert says that his work combines his ""passion for art, technology and storytelling."" The British artist originally trained as an oil painter, but today has an extensive list of clients including Apple, Adobe, BBC Television, GQ Magazine, and Paramount Studios. According to Lambert there isn't much difference between working on a tablet and conventional painting, except that after you are done you can watch the creative process back: . ""The advantage to using Procreate on the iPad is that you can create really high resolution artwork and the process of creating it can then be automatically exported as a video,"" Lambert says. ""The user interface is nice and simple which means you can quickly select brushes and colours without interrupting your thought process. The only disadvantage about working on a touch screen is that you have choose between using your fingers or a whole host of stylus choices. Personally I have become used to painting in on the iPad with my finger. This helps the interchange between pinching to zoom and navigate the painting and then tapping to paint."" Most of Lambert's work is done on an Apple Mac Pro but when he is away from his desktop, Lambert uses his sketchbook, Digital SLR camera, iPhone and iPad. According to the artist, the image of Morgan Freeman above required 285,000 brush strokes and more than 200 hours to complete. Lambert painted the work over a few weeks in November before posting the video this week. It received a million views in its first 12 hours online and currently stands at 8 million views. In 2011, Lambert was 'Featured Artist' at the Macworld Expo, where he delivered a talk about digital artwork and gave live demonstrations. He also offers art tutorials on his website, so if you are a budding artist with a passion for digital painting, you could do worse than to check out his webpage: kylelambert.co.uk .","Digital artist Kyle Lambert creates photo-realistic paintings on iPad .

"New York (CNN) -- In the mid-March chill, the victims and their stories continued to emerge as firefighters ferreted through the piles of bricks and wreckage on the East Harlem block where a powerful explosion and fire leveled two buildings. They brought life to a bustling neighborhood of corner bodegas, botanicas, churches, shops and redbrick tenements whose ordinary rhythms were shattered after the Wednesday morning blast killed at least eight and injured dozens more. They hailed from Greece, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The eighth body was recovered Thursday night, a fire department spokesman said. Among the victims was Alexis (Jordy) Salas, 22, an aspiring lawyer who checked on an elderly neighbor and member of his church -- who was also killed -- when the odor of gas filled corridors of their building the night before the blast, said his wife, Jennifer Salas. ""He knocked on our neighbor's door and when she didn't answer, he was worried,"" Jennifer Salas said Friday. ""Finally, she answered the door and said she was OK."" Jennifer Salas, a 20-year-old college student who is six-months pregnant, said her husband was sleeping when she left for school Wednesday morning. The gas odor lingered in the corridors. ""It wasn't as strong, but maybe I just got used to it,"" she said. Her husband, she said, studied at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and taught Sunday school at the store-front evangelical church on the ground floor of the now-destroyed apartment building where they lived. ""He liked going to church, studying, watching the news and knowing what was happening in the world,"" she said. ""He cared about his neighbors."" Another victim was the Salas' next-door neighbor, Carmen Tanco, a 67-year-old dental hygienist who relatives tried desperately to reach by cellphone. ""She's sassy, spicy, which is why her and I are so close,"" her niece, Marisela Frias, 44, said before learning her aunt had died. ""We have the same temperament, character. We tell it like it is, tell you the truth, whether you want to hear it or not. What you see is what you get."" Griselde Camacho, 44, who also died in the blast, was a public safety officer at the Hunter College Silberman School of Social Work in East Harlem, the school's website said. ""Griselde was a well-liked member of our community, a respected officer and a welcoming presence at our Silberman building,"" said Jennifer J. Raab, the college president. ""Our deepest sympathies go out to her family, and we are committed to doing everything we can to support them in their time of great emotional need. We also know this is a difficult time for all those who knew and worked with Sergeant Camacho. All of you will be in our thoughts in the days ahead."" Camacho and Tanco were remembered by Carlton Brown, bishop of Bethel Gospel Assembly, on the church's Facebook page. ""Our hearts are heavy as we will truly miss these two beautiful women,"" Brown wrote. ""Many of us share fond memories on how they have blessed our lives with their warm smiles and caring natures. They were both faithful volunteers."" Rosaura Hernandez, 21, who also perished in the explosion, was a line cook at Triomphe Restaurant, general manager Robert Holmes said. ""We liked her enthusiasm and raw talent,"" Holmes said. ""It's a terrible loss. My staff has taken it hard. ... She was solid as a rock, never got flustered. She was calm, even-tempered. One of our line cooks was quite close with her. When he heard she was missing, he said, 'Can I go find Rosie? I gotta look for her.' I said, of course. It's a terrible tragedy."" Another victim was Andreas Panagopoulos, 43. He was a musician and agent for a creative agency who was married to an editor at the Spanish-language daily El Diario La Prensa. ""We knew him as a very warm and funny person, who was always ready to help,"" Neska Husar, a representative of Production Paradise, said in a statement. ""We will also remember him by his great sense of humor, eloquence and elaborate e-mails -- he always took his time to explain his thoughts and work process."" Other victims include George Ameado, 44 and Rosaura Barrios, 44. One fatal victim remains unidentified. On Friday, former President Bill Clinton, whose foundation still has offices in Harlem, toured the blast site. City officials said they were making temporary housing available for the displaced. Mayor Bill de Blasio said 66 people, including 14 families with children, had received temporary shelter. Though authorities have said a gas leak may have triggered the explosion, de Blasio told reporters Thursday that the official cause was under investigation. ""We know there was an explosion,"" he said, ""but we don't know everything about the lead-up to it."" Desperate search for survivors . Near 116th Street and Park Avenue, once the heart of New York's large Puerto Rican community, firefighters -- for days -- have been tearing at mounds of bricks in a search for survivors from the collapsed five-story buildings, which housed a piano store and an evangelical church, in addition to apartments. The fire department tweeted Firday that 60% to 70% of the debris has been removed, enabling federal investigators to start their probe of the gas blast. On Thursday, Con Edison officials said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. Wednesday from a resident at one of the newer buildings on Park Avenue. The utility dispatched a truck two minutes later, but it arrived after the explosion. The caller reported smelling gas the night before but did not call the utility at the time. Two gas repairs were made on the block in January 2011 and May 2013 following complaints of a gas odor, Con Ed CEO John McAvoy said. The utility looked back at 10 years of checks and repairs on the gas main on the block and found no ""historical condition,"" he said. In addition, Con Ed checks for leaks in the area on February 10 and February 28 detected no problems. Fire officials said they received no reports of gas leaks in the area in the last month, while police reported receiving no calls since 2010. Fire marshals, police arson investigators and the National Transportation Safety Board -- which probes gas explosions -- worked to determine the cause of the explosion. ""In one word, devastating,"" was how Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB described the scene Thursday afternoon. He called it an ""active search and rescue operation."" ""You have, basically, two five-story buildings reduced to essentially a three-story pile of bricks and twisted metal."" Sumwalt said the agency was ""operating under the assumption that a natural gas leak led to an explosion,"" but that his team of investigators had not yet examined the crater where the buildings once stood. Some wreckage was still smoldering Thursday, with the fire whipped by the cold wind, de Blasio said. ""Our biggest concern now is the free-standing wall in the back,"" Edward Kilduff, fire chief of department, told the mayor during a tour of the site Thursday. ""That was a little more solid last night, but it burned overnight."" Surreal scene of destruction . The massive explosion shook Manhattan's East Harlem section around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Colin Patterson said he was watching TV when a thunderous blast suddenly sent pianos hurling through the air in the shop where he works. ""They flew off the ground,"" said the piano technician, who also lives in the building in East Harlem. He told CNN affiliate WABC that he crawled through the rubble and managed to escape unharmed. A building department official said one of the two Park Avenue buildings that collapsed received a city permit last year for the installation of 120 feet of gas piping. The work was completed last June. In 2008, owners of the adjacent building, which also collapsed, were fined for failing to maintain vertical cracks in the rear of the building. The condition was not reported as corrected to the buildings department. There were a total of 15 units in the two buildings, officials said. Building department records detailed a litany of violations, dating back decades, for one of the collapsed buildings, including a lack of smoke detectors, blocked fire escapes and faulty light fixtures. The mayor told reporters that the report of the gas leak, which he said came about 15 minutes before the explosion, was ""the only indication of danger."" Blast shook Manhattan for blocks . Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said responding firefighters barely missed the blast. ""If we were here five minutes earlier we may have had some fatalities among firefighters,"" he said. ""Not being here may have saved some lives."" Once a predominantly Italian neighborhood, the stretch of East Harlem saw a large influx of Puerto Ricans in the 1950s. It went on to be called Spanish Harlem and El Barrio. In the 1990s, many Mexican immigrants began to move into the area, which has been gentrified in recent years, with many mom-and-pop shops replaced by restaurants and bars.

"(CNN) -- A minor furor has broken out on social media after reports a Middle East Airlines (MEA) flight was refused entry to Baghdad because an Iraqi minister's son had been left behind in Lebanon. Various media outlets have reported that Mahdi al-Amiri, son of Iraqi Transport Minister Hadi al-Amiri, forced the plane to turn back after he missed the flight. Rima Mikaoui, director of public relations for Middle East Airlines-Air Liban, told CNN: ""It is true that MEA airplane that was heading to Baghdad yesterday on March 6, 2014 was forced to return to Beirut. ""Matter is still under investigation, and we are awaiting the result of the investigation."" The National News Agency (NNA) in Lebanon, run by the Ministry of Information, reported that ""20 minutes after taking off from Beirut International Airport, the director of MEA bureau in Baghdad informed the airliner that the Iraqi authorities would not allow the aircraft to land in Baghdad airport if it wasn't carrying the minister's son on board."" Other reports claim that airline staff searched for the missing passenger and made the usual announcements for boarding, and then departed after a six-minute delay without him. Investigations go on . Iraq's Transport Ministry has denied the claims, saying the plane was turned back due to ""cleaning operations"" at the airport. Various comments have since emerged on Twitter. ""You might consider getting ... to the gate on time, Mahdi al-Amiri,"" tweeted one. Lebanon's NNA has also reported that Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi Prime Minister, is investigating the allegations with a view to chastising those responsible. The Australian reports that MEA is in touch with the Iraqi authorities, claiming the incident has cost it time and money. Minister Hadi al-Amiri is also the head of Iraq's Badr Organization, a political party that was previously the armed wing of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.","MEA flight refused entry to Baghdad, turned back after 20 minutes .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid duly took advantage of Barcelona's latest slip-up to return to the top of La Liga after a routine 3-0 win over Levante in the Bernabeu Sunday. The mid-table visitors ended the match with 10 men after David Navarro was sent off in the second half for a foul on Cristiano Ronaldo, but they were well beaten even before he saw red. Ronaldo had put Real ahead after 11 minutes before defender Marcelo put the home side two up just after halftime. An own goal from Nikos Karabelas completed Levante's miserable evening. The victory put Carlo Ancelotti's men three points clear of city rivals Atletico. Defending champions Barca lost 1-0 to struggling Valladolid Saturday and trail by four in third place, making this month's El Clasico clash with Real all the more important. Real have not lost since a 2-1 league reverse to Barcelona in October as their goalscoring trio of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale have found the net on a regular basis. Ronaldo showed his heading qualities by rising to meet Angel di Maria's corner to put Real ahead before Benzema hit the post. Marcelo's superlative curling effort on 49 minutes all but settled the affair before Navarro, who was once banned for seven months after a notorious Champions League brawl when playing for Valencia, got his marching orders for the seventh time in his career. Marcelo also had a hand in the final goal as Karabelas turned the defender's cross into his own goal and there was just time for Ronaldo to thump the woodwork as he sought a second. Ancelotti was delighted as his team continued to mount a strong challenge on all fronts. ""We had the same intensity and concentration in the last few games,"" he told Real's official website. ""We played well from the first minute til the last; very efficient and with security at the back. The match was very good,"" he added. In Italy, Juventus have one hand on the Serie A title again after a 1-0 win over Fiorentina -- their 14th straight home league win. Ghana's Kwadwo Asamoah struck a stunning winner just before the break, finding space before sending a rocket shot into the top corner. It was reward for Juve's dominance against opponents they will meet again in the Europa League last 16. Fiorentina might have leveled after the interval as substitute Ryder Matos headed against the crossbar from close range, but Juventus were deserved winners. It left them 14 points clear of Roma, who lost 1-0 to third-placed Napoli in the late kickoff, with former Real Madrid forward Jose Callejon heading in a late winner.","Real Madrid beat Levante 3-0 in La Liga .

"(CNN) -- The draft for the first edition of International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) Sunday has attracted the top ranked players in the men's and women's game, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams. Teams based in Mumbai, Bangkok, Singapore and Dubai will contest the event from November 27-December 14 later this year with 24 matches taking place across the four host cities. Spain's Nadal was picked for Mumbai, who also include 14-time grand slam legend Pete Sampras, while his WTA Tour counterpart Williams is in the Singapore line-up. Novak Djokovic will feature for Dubai, with Wimbledon champion Andy Murray representing Bangkok. The event is the brainchild of Indian doubles star Mahesh Bhupathi and the concept is modeled on cricket's Indian Premier League. A total sum of $23,975,000 was spent across the four teams, with Bhupathi delighted to have attracted a clutch of current and former champions. ""We've got some unbelievably strong teams. I think out of the 28 players that got drafted we have about 21 Grand Slam champions. We have 14 present and past number ones. It's a pretty blockbuster field,"" Bhupathi said. The dates are during the off-season for both the ATP and WTA Tour, but there are some notable absentees with both Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova sitting it out. Australian Open champion Li Na is also missing despite her popularity in Asia and her male counterpart Stanislas Wawrinka has joined fellow Swiss star Federer on the sidelines. The matches will be in best-of-five format with single set contests in men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles and past champions singles. The schedule will see matches in Singapore, followed by Bangkok and Mumbai with the finale in Dubai.","International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) holds first draft .

"(CNN) -- It seems that travelers can't catch a break this winter. This time it'll be the Northeast that takes another hit from the barrage of winter storms that has pounded U.S. airline itineraries this season. By 9 p.m. Wednesday, more than 4,000 Thursday flights had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com, as the storm system wreaking havoc in the Southeast advanced up the East Coast. On Wednesday, the world's busiest airport, in Atlanta, accounted for the largest share of the day's flight cancellations, with more than 1,600 of the 3,300-plus cancellations across the country. About 27,000 flights were scheduled nationwide Wednesday, according to FlightAware. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina was the second most-affected airport on Wednesday, with nearly 860 cancellations. Mounting cancellations of Thursday flights are more evenly distributed, with hundreds in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington and New York area airports. Travelers seem to have heeded warnings to stay off roads in the South for most of Wednesday, but at least one international traveler really needed to get to the airport to take off. Austrian businessman Roland Dimai's wedding to Vlada Golovina is scheduled for this weekend in his hometown. But he almost didn't make it after traveling to Atlanta for a conference last week. After a rebooking and a cancellation, United Airlines put Dimai on one of the few Delta Air Lines flights leaving Atlanta on Wednesday, which arrived in sunny and clear Detroit in the afternoon. Now he can make his connecting flight to Frankfurt and get to the wedding on time. ""I finally think I've found the right woman and I thought it's possible the wedding will not happen,"" said Dimai, laughing as he called CNN just after landing in Detroit. ""I've been scared and sad and slightly hopeful to get it done."" 8 tips to ease winter travel woes . Dimai was one of the lucky ones. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines canceled about 1,700 of its Wednesday flights systemwide, and had already canceled about 1,200 Delta and Delta Connection flights set for Thursday. ""We anticipate a moderate resumption of arrivals beginning mid-morning (Thursday) followed by a set of departures in the 2:00 hour ET,"" Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said in a statement. ""Our plan is to then gradually ramp up Atlanta operations to our usual levels through the day Thursday and into Friday."" Southwest, which also operates AirTran Airways, said both airlines have suspended operations in Atlanta through 11 a.m. Thursday. Airlines don't like ice. Delta and Southwest Airlines didn't wait for Wednesday's ice storm to move many of their aircraft out of Atlanta. They flew airplanes to other airports to keep them out of the path of the storm. Winter storms do most of their damage to air travel on the ground, requiring that aircraft be de-iced while runways and taxiways are cleared and treated, all while passengers, luggage and cargo get loaded into an airplane. ""Everything slows to a crawl as personnel and ground equipment get bogged down in the slush,"" wrote commercial pilot Patrick Smith, who blogs about flight at Askthepilot.com, in his latest book. ""Planes, meanwhile, cannot take off with ice or snow adhering to the wings, and need to sprayed down,"" wrote Smith. It's not the weight of the ice ""but the way it disrupts airflow over and around a wing's carefully sculpted contours. ""This can take a half hour or more per plane, and to preclude further buildup it needs to be done as close to departure as possible. And with fluid costing upwards of $5 per gallon, airlines dread snowstorms almost as much as strikes, wars and recessions. When you add in handling and storage costs, spraying a single jet can cost tens of thousands of dollars."" It's going to get worse before it gets better across the East. The Atlanta and Charlotte airports expect frozen precipitation to continue through Thursday morning, according to FlightAware. At least most air travelers heading through Atlanta got the message about cancellations and delays before heading to the airport. About 175 passengers spent Tuesday night at the airport, said airport spokesman Reese McCranie. ""Those numbers are far less than the storm we had two weeks ago."" The stranded passengers were outnumbered by the 280 airport employees who worked overnight. Once the storm lets up, it could take days before the airlines can get all crew and aircraft back into position. Airline customers should check their flight status with airlines before departing for the airport. Many airlines are offering flexible, no-fee changes to travel dates.","NEW: Site: More than 4,000 flights originating in, flying to U.S. canceled for Thursday .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Eccentric basketball star Dennis Rodman and several other former NBA players have arrived in North Korea to take part in a controversial basketball game on the birthday of Kim Jong-Un, the country's young, unpredictable leader. The friendly contest is planned for Wednesday, when Kim is believed to turn 31, and features a number of NBA old-timers. It takes place just weeks after North Korea shocked the world by announcing the purge and execution of Kim's once-powerful uncle. Darren Prince, Rodman's agent for 16 years, told CNN on Sunday that Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, and Charles D. Smith would play against the North Korean Senior National Team. As they waited at Beijing airport for their flight on North Korean carrier Air Koryo, Rodman and his teammates told CNN that the main purpose of the trip was sport. Rodman said it was not his job to address concerns about the repressive state and lobby for the release of detained U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae. ""I'm going to try and interact with him (Kim Jong Un) on that point of love for sports. He loves sports. I like the guy, and he's an awesome guy to me,"" Rodman said. ""One thing is about showing people we can actually get along. Let's get along as human beings, not politicians."" It will be Rodman's fourth trip to the secretive and isolated nation, part of a project he has described as ""basketball diplomacy."" But the U.S. State Department says that it has nothing to do with Rodman's visits to North Korea and that attention should be focused on the brutality of Kim's regime. 'Friend for life' Rodman, 52, struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim when he traveled to North Korea for the first time in February, bringing a team of Harlem Globetrotters for an exhibition game watched by Kim, who is a basketball fan. Kim later met and dined with the flamboyant basketball star, and Rodman told his host he ""had a friend for life,"" shrugging off international condemnation of the country's human rights record. However, on his last trip, which took place last month less than a week after North Korea announced the execution of Kim's uncle and top aide, Jang Song Thaek, Rodman didn't get to meet Kim. The international outcry over the killing of Jang prompted Paddy Power, the online betting company that had supported Rodman's project, to withdraw its association with the event. But Rodman has pressed on with the plan. ""I'm looking forward to playing and putting on a show in North Korea. This is strictly about the game and for the love of basketball,"" Rodman teammate Vin Baker told CNN at the departure gate, where the players posed for photos with fellow travelers. Three additional former NBA players will be added to the team in coming days and will be traveling independently to Pyongyang with their assistants, Rodman's agent said Sunday. North Korea: Reality vs. the world according to Dennis Rodman . 'Publicity stunt' Rodman met and coached the North Korean team on his most recent trip. But Cho Sung-Won, a South Korean basketball player who played against North Korea in 1999, said Rodman should not underestimate the side: . ""The North Koreans were quite strong, well-built and tall as well,"" he said. ""They were very determined not to lose against South Korea. It was a friendly match, but I was a bit intimidated."" Cho was skeptical about Rodman's diplomatic aims. ""I don't know Dennis Rodman personally, but he is quite peculiar and does unexpected things,"" he said. ""I think he went to North Korea as a publicity stunt,"" Cho said. ""On the other hand, North Korea plays some high-quality basketball, so they could learn from his experience."" South Korean table tennis player Hyun Jung-Wha, who was part of a joint Korean team that took part in the 1991 World Championships, praised Rodman's bid to break the ice with Pyongyang. ""What Dennis Rodman is doing now is personal, but I think he's brave for doing it,"" she told CNN. ""I believe sports definitely can help diplomacy,"" Hyun said. ""Sportsmanship is pure, and I think diplomatic results can come out through sports."" But the U.S. government appears to be unconvinced. ""I know it's amusing or maybe interesting to talk about Dennis Rodman, but I actually think the focus really should be on the brutality of the North Korean regime he's going to meet with,"" Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said last month at the time of Rodman's previous trip. Opinion: Dennis Rodman smart on North Korea?

"(CNN) -- Faced by a man wielding a tennis racquet like a wand, Novak Djokovic produced some magic of his own to claim victory in the final of the Indian Well Masters event. Djokovic, who was blown away in the opening set by Roger Federer, was forced to summon every ounce of strength and determination to deny his opponent a fifth title at the Californian venue. Having lost the opener 6-3, Djokovic hit back to take the second 6-3 and win a third set tiebreak following an enthralling contest. It was Djokovic's third triumph at Indian Wells having won there in 2008 and 2011 and his first tournament victory of the year. Federer, the man so many dared to write off, showed once again that he still possesses enough magic to trouble his younger opponents. The 17-time grand slam champion had begun in imperious fashion, racing through the first set as Djokovic struggled for rhythm and consistency. Federer, 32, defeated Djokovic on his way to winning the Dubai title last month and his confidence was clear to see as he wasted little time in dominating his opponent. The Serb improved in the second set, probing away at Federer at every opportunity, gaining his first break point in the eighth game. And the six-time grand slam winner duly obliged, taking the second of the break points afforded to him to move 5-3 ahead. Djokovic then held his nerve, serving out the game to 30 to level at one set all and take the second 6-3. The World No.2 then had the opportunity to take control of the final set but failed to convert a break point in the opening game. Djokovic continued to put the pressure on the Federer serve and earned another break point in the third game -- but once again his opponent shut the door with a stunning forehand. But with Federer beginning to toil, Djokovic finally gained the break point he had so badly craved to move into a 2-1 lead. The contest continued to go with serve -- leaving Djokovic to serve it out at 5-4. It appeared for all the world that the he would simply go through the motions after becoming so dominant. But Federer, defiant until the last, took the first three points to move to 0-40 on the Djokovic serve. And the Swiss leveled at 5-5, taking the second of those break points to breathe new life into the contest before holding serve to love to move 6-5 ahead. Djokovic held his nerve to take the final set to a tiebreak with the crowd willing on both players following a pulsating contest. With both players having given everything, it was Djokovic who made the first significant breakthrough, moving into a 5-1 lead. Federer fought back to trail 3-6 but Djokovic finally prevailed, taking the tiebreak 7-3. Pennetta into final . In the women's event, Italy's Flavia Pennetta defeated World No.3 Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2, 6-1 to win the biggest title of her career. Pennetta, 32, had already seen off top seed Li Na of China as well as former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur. Radwanksa, seeded second, struggled throughout with an injury to her left leg and succumbed after an hour and 13 minutes. Pennetta had considered retiring from tennis before reaching the semifinals of last year's U.S. Open. Her decision to continue playing appears a wise one following her latest triumph. ""Last year exactly in this tournament I was thinking 'Oh my god, I can't play anymore,"" a beaming Pennetta she told reporters. ""Now I am here with the trophy."" Pennetta, who had not won a WTA event since Marcella in 2010, has now won 10 titles. ""The first set was I think pretty good,"" Pennetta said. ""I tried to go for winners. ""Second set, I see she has a physical problem and I started thinking too much.""","Novak Djokovic wins the Indian Wells title .

"(CNN) -- Sticks are the new boxes, at least when it comes to getting the Internet on your television. On Tuesday, Roku released its latest tool for streaming 1080p content directly to a TV. Like the $100 Roku 3 set-top box, the new $50 Roku Streaming Stick has a large selection of apps for streaming content, including all the major online services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant. The new Roku stick is about the size of a pack of gum and will be available in April. As game consoles, cable boxes and other bulky accessories pile up in living rooms, the smaller, more discreet stick approach is becoming an appealing choice for consumers who want to watch Internet content on their TV screens without adding to the clutter. This is not Roku's first foray into the stick form factor. But unlike its 2-year-old $90 version, the Streaming Stick will pop into any HDMI port, making it compatible with many more televisions. The Roku Streaming Stick will compete directly against Google's well-received Chromecast, released last year. The Google dongle costs only $35 and also plugs into any TV HDMI port. To watch Internet content on the Chromecast, you hit a button on compatible apps from an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet. Both sticks require a separate power source, either through a USB port on the back of the TV or by plugging into a wall. The Roku Streaming Stick will cost a few bucks more than the Chromecast but includes a dedicated remote control, like other Roku products. For people who prefer navigating with soft buttons to swiping a smartphone screen, this can be a big plus. Roku's biggest advantage is content. Because the service has been around for a while, it has many more streaming options than the Chromecast. There are currently about 1,200 available apps for Roku. Google recently opened up its Chromecast device to outside developers, so it's possible a wave of new content is on its way. For now, its big names are Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu, YouTube and Google Play, plus a handful of smaller apps. A third major competitor in the streaming-to-TV space is Apple TV. Apple's offering is still an old-fashioned box, but it could just be a matter of time before the company jumps on the stick-shaped bandwagon. It has more content options than a Chromecast but still lags behind the Roku. Of course, an Apple device would appeal to people already deep into the Apple ecosystem. Cable companies have been slow to update their set-top boxes, and smart TVs haven't caught on in the same way that easy-to-use Apple TV, Chromecast and Roku have. Roku is also working directly with television manufacturers to integrate its technology into their TVs.","Roku's new Streaming Stick is a small device that plugs into a TV .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong newspaper editor Kevin Lau, who became the center of controversy last month after being sacked from his post, is fighting for his life after being stabbed multiple times by an unknown attacker in Hong Kong, police say. Lau, who was walking to his car at the time of the attack early Wednesday, was left bleeding with life-threatening injuries to a lung, his wife told journalists. Lau was taken to the city's Eastern Hospital. The assailant escaped after jumping onto a motorcycle that was being driven by another man, police say. Last month, journalists were outraged when Lau was suddenly sacked from his post as the chief editor of Ming Pao, a newspaper known for its hard-hitting reporting on China. Over 90% of Lau's staff filed a petition demanding an explanation for Lau's removal, and some Ming Pao writers left their columns blank in protest. 'Outraged' Hong Kong's chief executive C.Y. Leung issued a statement Wednesday, saying he was ""indignant"" and ""outraged"" at the attack on Lau. ""Hong Kong is a society ruled by law, and we will not tolerate this kind of violence,"" he said. Hong Kong Journalists Association vice-chairman Shirley Yam said she felt ""terrified."" ""No journalist should be subject to violence,"" she told CNN. ""I have known Kevin for 30 years and I cannot think of any reason why anyone would try to kill him."" Worrying trend . The attack on Lau comes in the wake of Sunday's demonstration by thousands of Hong Kongers protesting what they see as rapidly escalating efforts by China's Communist Party to control Hong Kong's media. During the protest many of Lau's former colleagues spoke, saying Lau's dismissal reflected a worrying trend of media repression in the former British colony. Wednesday's incident is not the first example of a physical attack on Hong Kong's media. Last June, knife-wielding arsonists threatened workers and burnt 20,000 copies of the Apple Daily, another Hong Kong newspaper critical of the government. The Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong released a statement Wednesday. ""The growing number of attacks against members of the press in Hong Kong needs to be taken seriously by the local administration,"" the document said. ""Hong Kong's reputation as a free and international city will suffer if such crimes go unsolved and unpunished."" French-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Hong Kong 61st worldwide in press freedom in 2014 -- a far cry from its 18th place ranking in 2002, when its surveys were first conducted.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The National Football League attempted on Tuesday to dismiss more than 200 cases brought by nearly 4,200 retired players who said they were not warned of the dangers of head trauma. U.S. District Court Judge Anita Brody delayed a ruling on the request. ""I will rule when I sort this out for myself,"" she said before adjourning the packed courtroom. The class-action lawsuit could determine the league's role in caring for players with football-related neurodegenerative diseases. The players accuse the NFL of ""deliberately and fraudulently"" concealing the dangers of head trauma, and are seeking damages, treatment and medical monitoring for neurological injuries they sustained during their careers. The suit alleges the league didn't do enough to warn players that they risked permanent brain damage if they played too soon after a concussion and that it hid evidence about the risks for decades. Brody listened intently and asked a series of questions of both camps' high-profile representation during the hearing. Former NFL player wants brain studied . Paul Clement, former U.S. solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration, represented the NFL. David Frederick, who has argued a number of Supreme Court cases, spoke for the retired player plaintiffs. High profile attorney Ted Wells, who's represented former Dick Cheney adviser I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, among others, was observing Tuesday's arguments. Wells is one of the lead trial attorneys who will be representing the NFL should this case go to trial. The collective bargaining agreements players signed with their respective teams also apply to the NFL, Clement argued, adding that players receive benefits. ""This is an unusual industry,"" Clement said, adding that unlike most corporations, the union, clubs and league ""are worried about players."" ""This is a case about workplace safety,"" he added. In contrast, Frederick argued passionately that the NFL does not have immunity in all cases, especially those players who played while collectively bargaining agreements were in limbo from 1987 to 1993. Moreover, the NFL actively concealed the risks associated with repetitive impacts to the head, he said. The league didn't do anything about the injuries because they ""didn't cause bleeding or broken bones,"" he said. ""The NFL had held itself out to be the guarantor of safety. ... When the NFL began to glorify and monetize violence on the field, its breached its duty of due care."" A tale of two former NFL players and their brains . Last April, Alex Karras, the former Detroit Lions standout who starred in the 1980s sitcom ""Webster,"" joined hundreds of former NFL players suing the league over concussion-related injuries. Karras, who also played the horse-punching Mongo in the 1974 movie ""Blazing Saddles,"" served as lead plaintiff for what was then the 12th concussion-related complaint filed against the NFL by the Locks Law Firm in Philadelphia. Since then, the suits have been consolidated. He died in October following a battle with dementia, kidney disease, heart disease and stomach cancer. The suits claim that plaintiffs suffer from neurological problems after sustaining traumatic impacts to the head. Karras, for instance, ""sustained repetitive traumatic impacts to his head and/or concussions on multiple occasions"" during his NFL career, and ""suffers from various neurological conditions and symptoms related to the multiple head traumas,"" according to the suit, filed before his death. Last year, Karras' wife and ""Webster"" co-star Susan Clark said his dementia ""prevents him from doing everyday activities, such as driving, cooking, sports fishing, reading books and going to big events or traveling."" ""His constant complaint is dizziness -- the result of multiple concussions,"" she said in a statement. ""What Alex wants is for the game of football to be made safer and allow players and their families to enjoy a healthier, happier retirement."" Critics say players traded the risk of injury for gridiron glory, while the NFL asserts there's a shared risk in playing football. Former running back Dorsey Levens said Tuesday he knows a thing or two about ""having my bell rung."" ""We didn't know better. It's plain and simple,"" said Levens, who played for Green Bay and Philadelphia. ""We knew there'd be some aches and pains, some joints and some ligaments, that may be damaged, and we signed up for that, fine. ... Not being able to remember, I didn't sign up for that."" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello told CNN at the time the suits were filed that, ""any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit."" ""It stands in contrast to the league's actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions,"" Aiello wrote in an e-mail. ""The NFL has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so."" NFL Players Association, Harvard planning $100 million player study . But, said players' attorney Gene Locks at the time, ""(the NFL) had knowledge they didn't share with the players and didn't add the knowledge to the playing rules to protect players from head injuries. What we want is for the league to stand up and be counted, and examine everyone and provide medical benefits to everyone."" In recent years, the NFL has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field, adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to more independently evaluate injured players. In 2005, the league banned the practice of tackling a player by grabbing his shoulder pads, a move commonly referred to as a ""horse-collar"" tackle, after concluding it commonly resulted in injury. It also recently strengthened a 1979 rule that prohibits players from using their helmets to butt, or ""spear"" players during a tackle -- a rule that critics had often complained lacked official enforcement. Players such as Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison have since faced hefty and repeated fines for helmet-first tackles. Others have called for added protections, however, following a series of high-profile incidents involving former players' health. In May 2011, scientists announced that an autopsy of the brain of former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson, 50, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, showed evidence of ""moderately advanced"" chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. NFL linebacker Junior Seau -- who also took his own life last May -- suffered from a neurodegenerative brain disease that can develop from concussions known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE. CTE is a degenerative, dementia-like brain disease linked to repeated brain trauma. The disease has been found in the brains of 33 of 34 former NFL players, including Duerson, studied at the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy as of last May. Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. Scan may detect signs of NFL players' brain disease . A brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. But the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs when people are in their 70s or 80s. Several NFL players, including LaMar Campbell and Thomas Jones, have said they want to donate their brains for research upon their deaths. So does Kevin Turner, a former fullback for Philadelphia and New England. Turner suffers from ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Turner believes the ALS results from blows to the head he received while in the NFL. He also wants to donate his spinal cord after he dies. Judge Brody did not indicate how long it would take for a final decision on whether or not the suit goes to trial. But Turner said he and others can't wait too long for a ruling. CNN's Sunny Hostin, Rachel Wells, Ashley Hayes, Jason Hanna, David Ariosto, Michael Martinez and Thom Patterson contributed to this report.","More than 4,000 former players say they weren't warned of head trauma dangers .

"(CNN) -- Tensions continue in Crimea, with soldiers in unmarked green uniforms positioned at military bases and major cities, and citizens fearfully awaiting a resolution to the conflict. Although Russian President Vladimir Putin says these soldiers do not belong to Russia, their military vehicles' license plates -- and even some of the troops themselves -- suggest otherwise. At the port of Kerch, where about 100 soldiers were stationed, a commander openly told CNN that he and his men were from the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which has a base in Crimea's port city of Sevastopol. Outside the Ukrainian Navy headquarters in Sevastopol, a woman and her young daughter were stopped from bringing soup and meatballs to her husband inside Wednesday. Angry Russian supporters descended on her, calling her a ""provocateur"" and accusing her of being paid to make trouble. ""I'm here to give them food, because they're hungry,"" she said of the people inside. ""No one is feeding them. They can't go in or out."" Since last week, members of a self-appointed civil defense force -- volunteers who support Russia -- have blocked the headquarters entrance, backed up by masked, armed men in green combat fatigues, presumed to be Russian soldiers. The men blocking the navy headquarters entrance turned away a Sevastopol Red Cross worker who tried to bring in supplies. ""There are no problems with food,"" one of the men told him. ""Anyone who wants to eat can go home."" Across the street, wives and mothers have gathered to wave to the men holed up inside. Locals in Crimea are on edge. Opinion: Ukraine towns -- Apricot trees and vanished graves . In Simferopol Wednesday, Maria Zaborovska, 24, observed a small demonstration, consisting mostly of women, advocating against war coming to Crimea. The held signs with messages such as ""Putin, get your hands off Crimea."" Pro-Russian activists pushed the protesters from where they were standing and ripped their signs, Zaborovska said. Before the invasion, Ukrainian and Russian military units interacted closely in places like Sevastopol, said Zaborovska, who has been translating for international radio journalists this week, but the soldiers who have invaded military bases appeared to be keeping their distance. Ukrainian officials say 10 military installations that has been surrounded or taken over by Russian forces -- 16,000 troops in the past week. ""Either you surrender, or you're at the gunpoint of your ex-friend,"" Zaborovska said. At a Ukrainian air base in Belbek, near Sevastopol, Cmdr. Yuli Mamchur decided to face the green-clad troops peacefully on Tuesday. As the Ukrainians approached, the intruders fired warning shots, as shown in a video recorded by one of the Ukrainian soldiers. The Ukrainians moved forward. ""Stop, or I'll be forced to shoot at your legs,"" one of the intruding soldiers said in Russian. ""You're standing here with machine guns,"" Mamchur said. ""And we're standing here without weapons."" This confrontation resolved itself peacefully. But it showcases how tense the conflict has become, and how quickly it could become violent. Dozens of military families live at Belbek and find themselves caught in the middle. ""We're asking our government and the Russian government to get together as quickly as possible to sort this out,"" said Valya Bondarenko, wife of a Ukrainian soldier. The same tensions are playing out at the Perevolnaye military base, with an unmarked army -- presumably Russian -- locked in a mysteriously cordial standoff with Ukrainian soldiers. Army wives there are anxious that war might come. They say Sergey Aksyonov, the newly installed pro-Russian leader of Crimea, has put their husbands in an impossible situation. ""If they do not take the oath to the new Crimean authorities, then there will be fighting,"" one woman told CNN's Diana Magnay. ""And if there is a drop of blood spilled on either side, then our husbands will be held responsible."" Anchor quits: I can't be part of network 'that whitewashes' Putin's actions . Putin said Tuesday that local Ukrainians asked Russia for help, and that his military isn't planning to seize the Crimean peninsula. Any action would ""only be to protect local people,"" he said. But Putin has denied that troops in Crimea belong to Russia; instead, he described the armed men as ""local self-defense forces,"" not Russian troops. Before the crisis broke out, a significant number of Russian troops already were stationed in Crimea under an agreement reached between Ukraine and Russia in the 1990s. It appears that in recent days they have been deployed to places such as Kerch -- a port on the strait connecting the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov -- and Belbek, but it is unclear how many other forces may have come directly from Russia. In Simerfopol, the capital of Crimea, the regional government building boasts a Russian flag flying next to the Crimea flag; the Ukrainian flag has been taken down, CNN's Anna Coren reported. Many people in Crimea say they want the Russian troops there to ""save them from the 'fascists,'"" Coren said, noting the epithet some have used to describe the pro-Western Ukrainian government that has taken over since the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. But not everyone shares this view. Alex Shiroki, 35, from the coastal Crimean city of Yalta, says Russian supporters in his region tend to be over 30, while younger people seem less supportive of Russia. For his part, Shiroki does not think the invasion is justified and cannot understand why the Russian troops have come to Crimea. There are no ""fascists,"" he says. ""Here, just local people -- that's all we have,"" he said. Zaborovska said the notion of fascists in Ukraine has been part of Russian ""propaganda."" Like Shiroki, she is against the invasion. ""The people who share the same view as mine, they are afraid for their well-being,"" she said. As of Tuesday night, Shiroki had not seen any Russian soldiers in Yalta, or any other direct evidence of a Russian military presence, but the situation troubles him. People in Crimea have told CNN reporters on the ground that they can't sleep at night. Shiroki is also scared. ""I feel about the situation that it's so unsure, I cannot plan my life,"" he said. ""I cannot say what can happen to me tomorrow."" CNN's Anna Coren, Laura Smith-Spark, Michael Holmes, Chelsea J. Carter and Victoria Eastwood contributed to this report .","Confrontation at Belbek involved warning shots .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as Public Enemy No. 1? Well, 50 years ago, that was nearly true. As the nation celebrates the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington and the anniversary of King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech -- arguably one of the most important speeches of the 20th century -- few are also remembering that the historic civil rights leader was once under heavy surveillance by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Hoover's techniques were primitive but effective -- bugging hotel rooms, digging through trash cans for telltale receipts or paying close associates to reveal details. Back then, tapping someone's phone without a warrant -- the 1960s version of high-tech electronic surveillance -- was seen as taboo, condemned today as one of the excesses of that era. Those were the bad old days when law enforcement exercised too much power, and everyday citizens had fewer rights. But now, after a series of revelations about the sweeping extent of the government's electronic snooping capabilities, it's a moment to ask whether government surveillance has somehow gone full circle. Opinion: Did we really learn the lesson of the March on Washington? The modern-day FBI . Last week I interviewed outgoing FBI Director Robert Mueller, who has the same job today that Hoover held with an iron fist in the 1960s. Muller said the nation's approach to surveillance has changed from in the days when the government spied upon King. Today, said Mueller, things are different. ""I do think it's tremendously important as we develop the capability to gather intelligence that we focus on the goals of collecting that intelligence and assure that the objective is one that is agreed upon by Justice Department, the Congress, administration and the like,"" Mueller said. ""You can get out of a lane so to speak on intelligence because there aren't many guides as you have in the criminal justice system."" Mueller added that during his time as head of the FBI, investigations involving civil rights received high priority. The FBI website devotes dozens of pages to civil rights violations, hate crimes, human trafficking and modern slavery. They also investigate so-called color of law abuses -- acts carried out by government officials operating ""within and beyond the limits of their lawful authority"" -- excessive use of force, sexual abuse, false arrest and fabrication of evidence. The bureau says 42% of its total civil rights caseload for 2012 involved these types of investigations. Related: Our lessons with King . Muller said cases such as these are part of the FBI's ""smaller victories"" in recent years that also included extensive work in other areas, including public corruption, white-collar crime and mortgage fraud. ""At bottom, for us, it's the credibility of the institution and the focus on integrity that is at the heart of what we do. And to the extent that the American public believes that we are not political, that we are objective ... and treat everyone the same, it's tremendously important. It goes back to the integrity of the institution and its individuals."" Under surveillance . King had long been watched by law enforcement, including the FBI in the months and years before the speech. Surveillance of King in the 1960s was focused primarily on whether he and his movement were being infiltrated by communists, according to historians. But after King left Washington in August 1963, the surveillance escalated as the bureau began to view him as the ""most dangerous Negro in America."" The stepped-up surveillance was authorized by the brother of the president, none other than the attorney general of the United States, Robert F. Kennedy, on October 10, 1963. The younger Kennedy feared King had ties to top members of the American Communist Party. Ironically, five years later, in 1968, both King and Bobby Kennedy would be assassinated, just months apart. Humility and scandal . The surveillance focused on King's private life -- both the good and the bad. Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer David Garrow's meticulous accounts of the day-to-day -- and sometimes minute-to-minute -- details of King's life show him as being intensely self-critical. Related: Moving out of the dreamer's shadow . Garrow told CNN in 2008 that the secret tapes compiled by the FBI showed that King truly believed he was alive to be of service to others and ""not a man with any egomaniacal joy of being a famous person."" But the tapes also reveal another side of King. Private behavior that would surely attract tabloid headlines today -- including a secret meeting with a woman in Washington's Willard Hotel after a party -- was highlighted in the recordings. King was married and had four children. Today, the rules -- and the standards -- have changed. Electronic snooping by the government has higher standards, more controls and a completely different justification than in the days of King. Where the enemy was once communism, it is now terrorism. Investigators focus less on the private lives of highly public individuals such as King, and more on the thousands of people whose private communications and activities could come under the watchful eyes of government interceptors. Related: Everyday racism: How bias still sneaks in . Government officials say the modern surveillance programs involving telephone calls and Internet activity are carefully controlled by the courts, Congress and the White House. But we don't know everything about these programs because they are by their very nature, secret. The power of today's NSA . Still, old habits die hard. The most recent revelations involving the National Security Agency show that the government can peer into intimate moments in the lives of everyday Americans. And it has happened before. In his 2008 book about the NSA, ""The Shadow Factory,"" author James Bamford wrote about an NSA employee named Adrienne Kinne, who was quoted saying she made a personal decision to erase intimate communications that had been intercepted between Americans living abroad and in the United States. ""A lot of times I would just delete them. ... I would just do that because I didn't feel comfortable leaving it in the system and I didn't. ... A lot of times you could tell they were calling their families, waking them up in the middle of the night because of the time difference. And so they would be talking all quiet and soft, and their family member is like half asleep -- incredibly intimate, personal conversations -- and I just can't believe they were frigging recording them, and I don't know why they would ever have to to begin with."" Fast-forward to this week. A story first reported by The Wall Street Journal asserted that NSA officers have on several occasions ""channeled their agency's enormous eavesdropping power to spy on love interests."" So perhaps, if a guy like J. Edgar Hoover had access to a tool such as the NSA, it might have been hard for him to resist using it any way he saw proper. Even on a civil rights hero.","The Rev.

"(CNN) -- Soccer stars Zinedine Zidane and Kaka will take part in a charity match to help raise funds for the the victims of the Haiti earthquake. The two former world footballers of the year will be among 40 internationals lining up for the United Nations Development Programme's annual game, which will be held in Lisbon, Portugal on Monday. The seventh staging of the UNDP Match Against Poverty will feature two Haitians, Jean Sony and Joseph Peterson, who play for Portuguese clubs. Blog: Haiti can expect sporting support . Zidane, who won the World Cup with France in 1998 and retired from top-level football in 2006, is a UNDP Goodwill Ambassador along with former Brazil star Ronaldo. Ronaldo is unavailable as he is starting a new domestic season this weekend with his club Corinthians, so compatriot and Real Madrid star Kaka will take his place in Zidane's team. Michael Laudrup, named Denmark's best footballer of all time by his national association in 2006, will also play alongside Dutchmen Edgar Davids, Patrick Kluivert and Phillip Cocu, Portugal's Luis Figo, Czech veteran Pavel Nedved and Romania legend Gheorghe Hagi. The opposition, the Benfica All-Star line-up, will feature Portuguese football hero Eusebio along with more recent top names such as Rui Costa and Nuno Gomes. The U.N. said all proceeds will go toward relief and reconstruction efforts in Haiti, which was devastated by a magnitude 7.0 quake on January 12 that has killed least 72,000 people and left many more homeless. The match is also intended to focus attention on the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000, which seek to halve world poverty by 2015.","Soccer stars Zinedine Zidane and Kaka will take part in a charity match to help Haiti .

"(CNN) -- There have been a few moments in our history when a generation has used the power of its numbers and its passion for a cause to transcend a deeply divided society and change the course of the future for the better. We've come to one of those moments. About every 80 years, a young civic generation has forced the nation to deal with its fundamental challenges, according to Morley Winograd and Michael Hais in their 2011 book, ""Millennial Momentum."" They cite the American Revolution, the Civil War and the New Deal as key moments when a generation came together to create a different society. Today's millennial generation is the next generation to wield that power. I am a baby boomer. In the late 1960s, my generation rallied to make the case that a woman's right to choose should be guaranteed, and, 40 years ago on Tuesday, the Supreme Court handed down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Today, younger than 40 have always lived in an America where abortion has been legal. The pre-Roe v. Wade America is an America I remember all too well. Before and after Roe v. Wade . Privileged women traveled overseas to get a safe, legal abortion. However, more often than not, women stayed in the U.S. and were forced to go to back-street providers where they were humiliated and sometimes even died from these procedures. Memories of that era are fading as time goes by. But this past election cycle has proved that reproductive rights are still on the line. While Roe might guarantee the right to choose, a loud and organized movement is chipping away at a woman's ability to exercise her reproductive rights. In 2012, lawmakers enacted 42 anti-choice measures in 25 states. As Roe v. Wade marks its 40th anniversary, Winograd and Hais's millennial generation is coming of age. Numbering 77 million, by the 2020 election, they will make up nearly 40% of the electorate. They are educated, motivated and progressive. They will be able to sway elections, determine public policy and transform America. Research tells us that millennials are overwhelmingly pro-choice, and we have seen them take a stand. Like most of the public, millennials believe that politicians should not interfere with women's health care. And in turn, millennials have joined efforts to defeat Mississippi's ""personhood"" amendment, to protect funding for women's health services and to reject anti-choice candidates in the 2012 election. But it is crucial that even more pro-choice millennials continue to see the connection between the personal and the political because anti-choice activists are not slowing down. Four decades after Roe: A legacy of law and morality . During the past two presidential elections, we have seen millennials' ability to exercise their power, speak up and change the fabric of our nation. Many are speaking up online, in the voting booth, at the grass-roots level and in the hallways of our organizations. They are telling their stories and charting their own path, but it is critical that we create pathways to broaden and build a new conversation about protecting women's reproductive health. There is tremendous promise for what this generation can achieve, and where it wants to lead the conversation about the right to choose. As Roe v. Wade turns 40, the story of choice is at a crossroads. I know, with our voices combined, we will secure this hard-fought freedom for generations to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy Keenan.","Nancy Keenan: Tuesday marks 40th anniversary of Roe v Wade making abortion legal .

"(CNN) -- The Thai navy has filed criminal charges against two journalists over a report tying military personnel to human trafficking. The criminal defamation and computer crimes charges against the reporters from Phuketwan -- a news website in the province of Phuket -- relate to the July 17 article that included information from a Reuters investigative piece that alleged some Thai naval forces have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic Rohingya migrants fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar. According to the charge sheet, the navy accuses the journalists of knowingly publishing false information and committing slander. If found guilty, veteran Australian journalist and editor of Phuketwan, Alan Morison as well as reporter Chutima Sidasathian, a Thai citizen, could face up five years behind bars. A navy official filed the suit against Morison and Chutima last week on December 16. Two days later the journalists were fingerprinted at a Phuket police station and denied all charges, Morison told CNN. Human Rights Watch has condemned the move, warning the charges threaten press freedom in Thailand. ""The Thai navy's lawsuit is a reckless attempt to curtail journalists' reporting on alleged human trafficking by its officers,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch in a statement issued Thursday. ""Unless the government withdraws the case, its impact will be felt far beyond those reporting on abuses against the Rohingya -- and could have a choking effect on all investigative reporting in Thailand,"" he added. Journalists from Reuters could face similar charges over the original article, according to Human Rights Watch, however the news agency said that it has not been notified of any legal action. ""Our story was fair and balanced and Reuters has not been accused of criminal libel,"" said Reuter's Global Head of Communications, Barb Burg. Denying the charges, Morison said the Reuters report was published by media outlets around the world and the actions of the Thai Royal Navy has him and his colleague puzzled. ""The mystery is why the navy has chosen to sue Phuketwan journalists over these allegations,"" Morison and Chutima said in a statement. ""The article at the center of the charge on Phuketwan was a selection from the Reuters special report on the Rohingya. The paragraph and headline in question does not name the Royal Thai Navy,"" Morison told CNN on Sunday. ""The navy's action over one paragraph has created a perfect storm. If the navy proceeds with the case, the Rohingya issue is now tied up in their action against media under a controversial law."" An official from the Royal Thai Navy, who asked not to be named, told CNN the navy, ""does not intend to obstruct any media from, or threaten any media for performing their duties. What we are trying to do is to protect our organization from false allegations."" ""Phuketwan and Reuters jounalists have put out their accusing statements without reaching us and providing us at least a fair chance to explain,"" the official added. Morison, 65, is originally from Melbourne. He produces Phuketwan.com and also freelances for international media, including CNN, the The Sydney Morning Herald and the South China Morning Post. He worked for CNN as CNN.com Asia Deputy Editor in 2001-2002 and has been in Phuket for 11 years. He and Chutima are due to return to the police station for further investigation on December 24. Morison said it is expected police will ask for formal statements from the reporters. If convicted, they could face jail time of up to five years under Thailand's controversial Computer Crimes Act, as well as a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($3,300). The Computer Crimes Act, which came into force in Thailand in 2007, seeks to bar the spread of material believed to threaten national security or create panic. But the law has attracted criticism from freedom of expression advocates and global internet providers for making online users liable for reproducing content originally published by others. It's believed to be the first time an arm of the Thai military has used the law against the media, Morison said. He described the authorities' response to the Reuters story as like ""breaking a butterfly on a wheel."" Phuketwan, although a small organization, has become known for its investigations into allegations of abuse against Rohingya people in Thailand and corruption on the island of Phuket. Each year, boats carrying hundreds of Rohingya fleeing ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar are intercepted in Thai waters by authorities. Thailand has a policy of what it calls ""helping on"" the Rohingya to Malaysia. Several media reports and rights advocates claim some Rohingya end up in the hands of people smugglers who demand money for their release. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Sophie Brown contributed to this report.","Thai navy files criminal defamation and computer criminal charges against journalists .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's army chief said the military -- one of Thailand's most powerful institutions -- would not step into the current political crisis, saying that the country's laws were enough to confront deadly protests that have punctuated a three-month power struggle. In a televised address, Gen. Prayuth Chanocha said the military did not want to exacerbate an already volatile situation. ""If we use full military force, there is no guarantee that the situation would return to normalcy,"" he said, in an address widely seen as a signal to the Thai public. ""The current conflict has spread wider than in 2010,"" he said, adding that the political impasse had more complicated conditions and involved more disparate groups. ""The military does not want to use weapons and forces against our own Thai (people),"" he added. ""Under the current situation, constitution laws are perfectly effective. If there is a continuation of a loss of life, the country will fall."" War of words . Meanwhile, Thailand's rival factions continued their war of words. Protest leader and former deputy prime minister, Suthep Thaugsuban, warned that his rivals in the red-shirted United Front (UDD) were planning a coup. ""At the UDD rally they also discussed the possibility of a separatist movement, dividing Thailand into two,"" Suthep said. ""But we have never entertained this notion. We are fighting to keep Thailand united as one. They can rally around the 'red flag' but we will continue to salute our tricolor flag."" At the ""war drum"" rally on Sunday, Jarupong Ruengsuwan, the Pue Thai Party Leader, said that violence threatened to escalate. ""Let me leave a warning to all people and to those who want to harm the country and the People of Thailand that Thais own 10 million guns in this country,"" he said. ""Whoever wants to insult the power of people, they will see."" On Tuesday, violence simmered in the capital Bangkok where police said a series of blasts and gunfire took place in the early hours of the morning near Lumpini Park. Two people received minor injuries in the incident, police said. Attacks condemned . Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra on Sunday condemned weekend attacks that killed four people -- three of them children -- and pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice. A six-year-old-girl, a four-year-old boy and a woman of about 40 died when a bomb exploded at an anti-government rally outside a shopping mall in the Ratchaprasong area of Bangkok, the Erawan Emergency Center reported. The children were siblings. The 22 wounded included a pre-teen boy who was in critical condition, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, Thailand's national security chief. On Saturday night, a 5-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet when attackers opened fire on an anti-government demonstration in eastern Trat province, police Col. Jirawut Tantasri said. Another 34 were wounded, he said. Patthanathabut said police think the two incidents are connected. ""We believed that there is an element which is armed and prone to use violence mean to achieve their goal."" What's behind the Thai unrest? The deaths were the latest to punctuate three months of protests against the Shinawatra government. In a statement issued Sunday night, Yingluck said her government ""will not tolerate terrorism"" and would prosecute the killers ""without exception."" ""I would like to ask all sides of the political divide that we may see things differently and there are many ways to express those differences,"" Yingluck said. ""But the use of violence that lead to deaths are not the civilized way of the living."" Protests to continue . Both the Ratchaprasong and Trat demonstrations were organized by the opposition People's Democratic Reform Committee, which vowed to continue protests despite the attacks. On its Facebook page, the movement called for supporters to donate blood at hospitals that were treating the wounded from the Ratchaprasong bombing. ""Although we have lost several friends in these attacks, I would like to insist that we follow our course of peaceful, unarmed, and nonviolent demonstrations,"" party leader Suthep said in a statement on the Facebook page. ""We are on the right course. We are fighting the good fight. Please carry on as we have."" In Trat, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) east of Bangkok, Jirawut said the girl who died was eating noodles with her grandmother when two cars passed the demonstration of about 1,000 people. The attackers threw grenades from the first car while the occupants of the second began shooting into the crowd, he said. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement Sunday condemning the violence and calling for it to end. He ""urges the parties to respect human rights and the rule of law, prevent any new attacks and engage in meaningful dialogue toward ending the crisis and advancing reform,"" the statement read. He added that he is ready to ""assist in any way possible."" Calls for change . The People's Democratic Reform Committee has called for the democratically elected Yingluck to be replaced with an unelected ""people council,"" which would see through electoral and political changes. Yingluck is the brother of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in exile. Yingluck's critics accuse her of being a proxy for her brother, who was convicted of corruption charges in 2008 and sentenced to prison in absentia. Yingluck's government was largely stable until her party attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill in November, sparking the current wave of protests. The bill would have nullified Thaksin's corruption conviction and allowed him to return to the country. Also Sunday, a group of protesters called the Red Shirts joined in the protesting. Between March and May 2010, thousands of opposition protesters known for the color of their shirts occupied parts of the shopping district in central Bangkok. For the most part, the Red Shirts were supporters of Thaksin. They wanted the resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and a new general election. In 2011, up to 30,000 Red Shirts descended on the same area, this time demanding a thorough investigation of a deadly government crackdown that May, along with the release of protest leaders, some of whom had been held in jail on terrorism charges for months. On Sunday, the Red Shirts gathered in Nakhonratchasrima, about 100 miles from Bangkok. There were about 3,000 protesters in the mostly peaceful protest, according to Paradon. The Red Shirts encouraged the government to prepare in case it needed to set up an exile office in the northern or northeastern parts of Thailand. The leaders of the protest asked members in each province to set up and train their own people in security techniques and be prepared for prolonged protests.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City brought misery to a rainy Wednesday in north London as they defeated Tottenham to knock rivals Arsenal off their perch at the top of the English Premier League. A lacklustre Arsenal had dropped valuable points at Southampton and Man City took advantage to move two points ahead of the Gunners with a free-flowing 5-1 victory against Tottenham. But manager Manuel Pellegrini poured cold water on any talk of City now being title favorites despite the London rout. ""I think it's too soon to be the favorites -- there's a lot of matches to play,"" he was quoted on the club website. ""If we continue to play the way we are, we will have chances to win but it's early."" Agile Argentine Sergio Aguero pounced after 15 minutes to give City the lead only to hobble off the pitch with a right leg injury just before half time. Even without Aguero, who has now scored 50 EPL goals, Manuel Pellegrini's men found their scoring boots in the second half. Yaya Toure stroked home the ball from the penalty spot after Danny Rose was shown a red card for a lunge on Edin Dzeko in the penalty area. Dzeko got in on the act as he clipped in David Silva's rebounded shot from close range before substitute Stevan Jovetic added to the scoreline with his first league goal. City captain Vincent Kompany polished off the victory over 10-man Spurs late on. Chelsea missed their chance to close the gap on Arsenal and Man City as they were held to a 0-0 draw by a gutsy West Ham side. Even with a whopping 39 attempts on goal, Jose Mourinho's men could not find the back of the net as the relegation threatened Hammers dug in. It looked as if there might be a reprieve for Chelsea as seven minutes of extra time were added on but Demba Ba, Eden Hazard, Samuel Eto'o and Frank Lampard were all denied. Lampard clasped his hands to his face in disbelief at the final whistle as Chelsea missed their chance to go second in the table and for now stay third, three points off the leaders. A frustrated Mourinho commented on Sky Sports: ""If I was at home watching for sure I would turn off or change to another match."" Maybe the match the Portuguese manager should have watched was Aston Villa's pulsating 4-3 victory over West Bromwich Albion. It may not be the game that settles the thrilling title fight but it was arguably the match of the night Wednesday. In Germany, Bayern Munich were back in business in the Bundesliga as they rallied to beat Stuggart 2-1 and stretch their unbeaten league run to an astonishing 43 matches. Pep Guardiola's league leaders had Thiago Alcantara and Claudio Pizarro to thank for getting back on terms after Vedad Ibisevic had put the home side ahead. Bayern's record run in the German league dates back to October 2012 and, as if one record wasn't enough, they also notched up their 28th away match in the Bundesliga without defeat. In Italy, intensity was the key for Rafael Benitez as he watched his Napoli side book a place in the Coppa Italia semi-final, which are staged over two legs. A solo strike from Gonzalo Higuain was enough to sweep aside holders Lazio and book a last four meeting against Roma. Udinese host Fiorentina in the other semifinal. There was rain in Spain as Barcelona braved the weather to complete a 5-1 victory over Levante at a soggy Nou Camp to advance to the Copa del Rey semifinals. Goals from Adriano, Carles Puyol, Alexis Sanchez, who scored twice, and Cesc Fabregas sealed a 9-2 win on aggregate. Holders Atletico Madrid set up a hotly anticipated semifinal with city rivals Real Madrid after beating Athletic Bilbao 2-1 Wednesday.","A lively Manchester City side thrash Tottenham 5-1 in the English Premier League .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Abu Ahmed says he was there: An Iraqi held prisoner at Abu Ghraib by the American military when inmates were abused. Abu Ahmed says he and other inmates were held naked and forced to stand in their cells. He says he was kept naked and saw other naked inmates stacked onto a pile while photos were taken, photos that would become public and bring shame to the United States. The pain of the past few years is clearly etched on the man's face and equally obvious as he talks. It began October 1, 2003, he says, when U.S. troops came to his home and detained him during a sweep of his neighborhood. The next day, he was processed and put into Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. ""They made us take off all our clothes, even our underwear,"" recalled the man who is afraid to reveal his identity, instead offering up the alias of Abu Ahmed.  Watch Abu Ahmed tell his story » . ""They walked us in front of all the cells, about 50 or 60 cells, in front of all the detainees, in front of the soldiers, of the female soldiers. They got us in the cells, still naked, and they locked us inside,"" he said, tears welling in his eyes. ""They made us stand in the corner of the cell. We were not allowed to sit down. We were not even allowed to talk.""  See the photos of the abuse » . That treatment went on and on, Abu Ahmed said. ""For 32 days I was without clothes, even if we wanted to pray, we had to pray naked."" Abu Ahmed says he saw more abuse from his cell, including one of the incidents captured in one of the infamous photos. ""One day, they brought three or four detainees, maybe more. They were about 40 years old or older. They took off their clothes, forced them to climb on top of each other and start taking pictures ... I saw it with my own eyes,"" he said. ""Those detainees, I found out, were former Iraqi officers -- they brought them after a fight inside the camps, they brought them because they were very well respected inside the camp, so they humiliated them and returned them to the camp as a message to the others."" The U.S. military fully admits that the treatment of Iraqis inside Abu Ghraib at that time was unacceptable by its own standards, and that detention centers in Iraq today are run on very different lines. President George W. Bush declared that the ""abhorrent"" acts were ""a stain on our country's honor and our country's reputation."" They made Americans ""sick to our stomachs,"" he said in May 2004, soon after the photos became public. But Abu Ahmed says it is still hard for him to look at an American. ""Thanks to God, I have the ability to handle worse sights. I can't blame you for everything that these people did,"" he said. ""But, at the end, the American people are responsible for everything that happened,"" Abu Ahmed said, referring to the war that he believes turned his life upside down. Abu Ahmed spent a total of 20 months in U.S. custody, between Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, outside Basra in southern Iraq. He then returned home, where he spent less than five months with his family before being arrested again, this time by the Iraqi army in yet another sweep through his neighborhood. He says his treatment inside Iraqi facilities was even worse than what he faced at the hands of the U.S. military. His Iraqi captors, Abu Ahmed says, beat him with cables and pipes; he even had a cement block hung from his genitals. Documents issued to him by the U.S. military corroborate many aspects of his story, showing that he was in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca during the time he says he was. He asked us not to contact the Iraqi army to confirm details of his detention, fearing that they might arrest him again. He does not want any restitution and now works with the Iraqi government, trying to rebuild his life. Abu Ahmed has never been charged with a single crime.","Man says he was held naked in Abu Ghraib prison during 2003 abuse of inmates .

"(CNN) -- Despite appearances to the contrary, the West doesn't have a Ukraine problem. It is clear from the large demonstrations that have swamped the streets of Kiev in recent weeks that the Ukrainian people want closer integration with the European Union, to secure higher prosperity and cleaner government. The problem lies with Russia and its determination to keep Ukraine within its orbit using threats and inducements. In contrast to the EU's adherence to democratic institutions, competitive markets and the rule of law, Vladimir Putin has a rival integration project based on his own model of corrupt state capitalism. Read more: Ukraine, Russia sign economic deal . It used to be said that the best way to encourage political and economic reform in Russia would be to use the power of example by making a success of reform in Ukraine. The events of the last few weeks may cast doubt on whether that approach is enough. The focus of Western policy-makers should also be on how to re-engage Russia, not least because the decline of the country's energy dominance and the failure to modernize its economy is breaking its growth. Political repression is adding to these problems by stifling the creative energies of the middle class. Without meaningful reform, Russia faces long-term stagnation and the risk of a major systemic crisis. A troubled Russia that strives to hold back the countries around it is not in anyone's interests. But what scope do western governments have to influence change for the better? The ""Ukraine first"" approach came into vogue because Russian leaders simply brushed aside criticism of their record on human rights and business standards. If anything, President Putin's tone suggests an increasingly belligerent attitude. Despite this, there are underused levers of persuasion that could form the basis on new transatlantic approach towards Russia, especially in the fields of trade and economic relations. Read more: Beware Russia's power play in Ukraine . Unlike the Soviet Union, Russia is becoming highly integrated into the global economy and dependent on the advantages it brings. Growth and state revenues require access to foreign export markets. Large investment shortfalls, especially in the energy sector, demand inflows of foreign capital and technology. Russia now enjoys the privileges of WTO membership and aspires to join the OECD. Its elites like to take advantage of international mobility to enjoy life in the West. These needs and preferences create points of leverage that the West could be using to much greater effect. By insisting that its status within the global economy is conditional on its maintenance of agreed standards, we can push Russia to address deficiencies relating to property rights, investor protection, judicial independence and the rule of law. The EU and the U.S. are already showing that a rules-based approach to business standards can have an impact. In targeting Russians responsible for human rights violations committed against those seeking to expose unlawful activities carried out by government officials, for example, the 2012 U.S. Magnitsky Act provides a powerful deterrent to corruption. Separate provisions of the act press the U.S. administration to implement a rule of law for the business agenda with Russia addressing investor protection. European and American leaders should keep such lessons in mind as they negotiate the planned Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Closer economic ties can provide opportunities to influence third party countries. One of the TTIP's aims is to ""enhance co-operation"" on principles of global concern. For Russia, this could involve the adoption of a common position on the country's OECD application, investor protection and a crack-down on corruption and economic crimes. Read more: Putin defends Russia's record on free speech . TTIP could even be accompanied by an agreement to treat an attack on the economic interests of one as an attack on the economic interests of al -- a sort of economic counterpart to NATO's Article 5. For example, the so-called Magnitsky Act mandates the U.S. government to seek compensation of American investors who had their assets illegally seized with the break up of Yukos Oil. European investors in Yukos suffered the same fate. TTIP could incorporate principles of collective action and mutual support in such cases. Initially Russia wouldn't like these measures, but it has far more to lose from a damaged trade and investment relationship than the West does. Read more: Who broke the law, Snowden or NSA? Europe and North America are bound together in their support for an open global economy. It is in their interests to prevent countries like Russia from taking advantage of that openness without abiding by the fair market rules that undergird it, or respecting the wishes of independent countries like Ukraine to develop their own economic ties. But the country that stands to gain most is Russia itself. Only major economic change will guarantee the growth and prosperity it needs to be strong in the world, and that economic change can only come through partnership with Europe and the U.S. Read more: Putin pardons oligarch .

"London (CNN) -- During the 1970s, Britain's car industry was the sick man of Europe: many models were poorly designed and built, politicians and the nationalized company management lacked strategic vision while workers were often on strike. Four decades on, that perception has been turned on its head. Despite the closure of the last British-owned volume car maker, Rover, in 2005, the country is now building near-record numbers of vehicles while the proportion of cars exported is the highest ever. Belying the moribund state of the global economy, sales of luxury models are now leading the charge. On Monday Rolls-Royce posted its best results in its 107-year-history with 3,538 cars -- which cost upwards of £200,000 ($308,000) -- sold in 2011, a 31% rise over the previous year's figure. This growth is powered by surging demand in Asia: China now joins the United States as the BMW-owned marque's most significant markets. Look at high-res images of historic Rolls-Royce . ""We had an outstanding year in 2011 and we should take a moment to reflect on this Great British success story,"" said the company's CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos. Rolls-Royce spokesman Andrew Ball told CNN the company was profitable but declined to detail any figures. The booming Rolls-Royce sales figures come days after its former sister company, Bentley, posted a 37% rise in global sales, also on the back of rising sales to China and the U.S. The Volkswagen-owned company, based in Crewe, in northern England, in 2011 sold more than 7,000 cars, the prices of which start at £133,000 ($208,000). The rise in output comes on the back of a huge rise in productivity. In the 1970s, 545,000 people were employed in Britain's car factories, making 15 million cars during that decade. Between 2001 and 2011 there were only 133,000 workers in the industry, but they produced 16.1 million cars. Toyota has recently created 1,500 jobs at its plant in Derbyshire in a £100 million investment while Jaguar Land Rover said it would double the size of its factory on Merseyside providing 1,000 new jobs. The success of British car makers is echoed by U.S. car makers which are expected to report their first profits since 2004. Most analysts are forecasting better industrywide sales in 2012 and beyond. They see sales rising from 12.8 million in 2011 to between 13.5 million to 14 million this year and close to 15 million by 2014 or 2015. Detroit automakers are finally making profits . Rolls-Royce's sales figures are the best since 1978 when the company sold 3,347 cars, mainly of the Silver Shadow II model. The latest Rolls-Royce models share many components with BMW models, such as the 7-series, but cost more than twice as much. Motoring journalist Iain Reid of What Car? magazine said part of the reason behind R-R's success lay in its product range. ""If you make the right models people will buy them. The Ghost car is proving successful because it is a bit more affordable and less ostentatious than the Phantom."" The Rolls-Royce brand was doing well, he said, because it married British heritage with BMW's sales and marketing expertise. Reid added that companies such as Nissan, BMW Mini and Honda had good plants in the UK that were building desirable cars. ""You can't go wrong with that mix,"" Reid told CNN. Industry analyst Paul Nieuwenhuis said that while many customers bought luxury cars ""by the meter"" -- that is to say they care more about the image than the machine -- modern Rolls-Royce cars were exceptional vehicles. ""They are surprisingly agile, and don't feel nearly as big as they actually are. And their attention to detail is unrivaled."" Nieuwenhuis, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School, said Britain had a global reputation for building luxury cars. ""This is something that we are doing well, despite our own car market doing badly."" He added that the Rolls-Royce sales figures showed that ""rich people still have money"" especially in China. The rights to use the Rolls-Royce name have been owned by BMW since 1998 when Vickers sold off Rolls-Royce Motors, which also made Bentley cars. Volkswagen paid £430 million for the existing factory in Crewe but did not secure the rights to use the Rolls-Royce name on their vehicles. This was bought from Rolls-Royce plc, which continues to make aero engines, for £40 million by BMW, which built a new plant in Goodwood, West Sussex, in southern England.","Rolls-Royce posts best results in 107-year-history with 3,538 cars sold in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- The threat of terrorism, the potential for protest, shoddy accommodation and even a lack of snow. Just four of the problems faced by organizers of the Sochi 2014 Winter Games, which came to a glittering conclusion on Sunday. After 16 days of competition, and a record 98 gold medal events, can Russia's first ever Winter Olympics be labeled a success? ""Russia delivered all what it had promised,"" said International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach in his speech at the closing ceremony. ""What took decades in other parts of the world, was achieved here in Sochi in just seven years."" It followed comments Bach had made in his earlier press conference, when he posed the question: ""Let's ask those who criticized the Games if they are ready to change their opinion."" With the Olympic cauldron now extinguished, CNN takes a look at whether the country's $50 billion budget was money well spent. Accommodation . When the world's journalists arrived in Sochi the readiness of the resort's accommodation was the subject of widespread coverage and some ridicule. Broken curtain rails, orange tap water and a shortage of available rooms dominated the pre-Games coverage. But as the Olympians arrived in the Black Sea, the reviews became altogether more positive. ""After five days I have no problems,"" Russian speed skater Ekaterina Lobysheva told CNN. ""The accommodation has been great."" The village, however, wasn't quite as advertised. Swimming pools were empty as the athletes began filing in and the landscapes around the blocks had not been developed as intended. ""In the brochure the organizers provided to the teams, this area was meant to be a bird sanctuary, but I don't think they were able to plant the trees in time,"" Team Great Britain's short-track speed skater Charlotte Gilmartin told CNN. ""But apart from that everything else has been great,"" she said. IOC chief Bach applauded the welcome Russia had afforded to the Olympians. ""I spent four nights in different Olympic villages and had an opportunity to learn the opinions of those sportsmen who are important to me,"" he told reporters. ""None of the athletes uttered a word of complaint to me,"" he said. And as the Games continued, any accommodation worries went out of the window as athletes became increasingly interested in each other. The dating app Tinder, which matches makes people based on their location, reported a 400% day-over-day increase of new users in Sochi at one point during the Games. Some athletes including Slopestyle gold medal winner Jamie Anderson even admitted she had to delete the app in order to focus on competition. Weather . Would there be enough snow? Would it be too warm? Just two of the questions frequently asked about the weather in sub-tropical Sochi ahead of Russia's first Winter Games. Those fears proved wide of the mark with the conditions largely agreeable over the competition's two weeks. Organizers were able to make enough of the white stuff and while a thick fog descended and forced the postponement of biathlon and snowboard cross events, on the whole the competitions were able to take place as planned. However, warming temperatures did lead to the deterioration of the halfpipe, the standout event of snowboarding's Winter Olympic program. Before and during the Games, boarders expressed concerns over the condition of the pipe. Hannah Teter, a three-time Olympian and a halfpipe gold medal winner in 2006, was particularly outspoken and even suggested the event be pushed back. But it went ahead as planned, despite Teter's worries that the conditions prevented boarders from demonstrating the best of their sport. Sporting success . Slopestyle's Olympic debut was the highlight of an Olympic Games which showcased extreme winter sports like never before. The snowboarders and skiers who took to the snow at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park captured the imagination of sports fans across the globe. The Dutch dominance of the speed skating events at the newly-built Adler Arena, where the Netherlands won eight golds and 23 total medals. of 12 gold medals on offer, is also worthy of note. But the Games didn't pass without controversy, notably in the women's figure skating competition. The gold medal went to Russia's Adelina Sotnikova, with many dismayed as to why it wasn't awarded to South Korean defending champion Kim Yuna. An online petition was started to overturn the result which has so far attracted over two million signatures. ""The The International Skating Union (ISU) is strongly committed to conducting performance evaluations strictly and fairly and has adequate procedures in place to ensure the proper running of the sporting competitions,"" said the ISU. ""The officiating judges were selected by random drawing from a pool of 13 potential judges. All judges in an event represent different ISU member federations. ""The Ladies' free skating panel included judges from Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine. And as no official protest was lodged with the International Skating Union, the decision stood. Doping . Six athletes tested positive for banned substances during Sochi 2014, most notably Swedish ice hockey star Nicklas Backstrom. That is in contrast to the one positive test recorded during the Vancouver Games in 2010. Backstrom's positive test was announced hours after he played for Sweden in a 3-0 defeat to Canada in the gold medal match on the final day of the Games. Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duer was also chucked out of the men's 50km, which took place on the final day of the Games, after testing positive for the banned substance EPO. ""The number of cases for me is not really relevant,"" IOC chief Thomas Bach told reporters on Sunday. ""What is important is that we see that the system works. It shows that the IOC is serious with zero tolerance because the athletes have been disqualified from the Games."" Terrorism . Two separate suicide bombings in the city of Volgograd, 420 miles north east of Sochi, sparked security fears ahead of the Winter Games. But those fears never materialized. Russia's ""ring of steel"" around Sochi and the increased police presence -- including 400 specially recruited Cossack soldiers -- prevented an attack in the region during the Games. CNN's National Security Analyst Robert Baer suggests the calm in Russia during Sochi 2014 was due to the Federal Security Service (FSB). ""They have enormous power in Russia,"" said Baer. ""They did a bunch of raids, they locked down villages. ""They went to organized crime groups, Chechen in particular, and convinced them -- with money -- to close these people down. ""The Russians, when they want to do a lockdown, know how to do it."" Protest . The Games weren't without protests, most notably by punk rock protest band Pussy Riot. A video released last week showed members of the band being beaten by security officials in Sochi as they tried to record a music video. The incident took place one day after two members of the band, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, as well as journalists and Russian human rights activists were held in a police station just miles from the Olympic Park. A prominent Italian gay rights activist Vladimir Luxuria claimed to have been arrested during the Games. Luxuria, who become Europe's first openly transgender parliamentarian when she was elected to the Italian chamber of deputies, was allegedly detained after displaying a banner which read ""Gay is OK"" while watching the action in Sochi. Russian officials said there was no record of her detention. ""I think it is important (to have) the opportunity to talk internationally about these things because otherwise these things happen in Russia and nobody knows, nobody cares,"" Luxuria told reporters. ""They think: 'Well, it's not in our country, it's far away, it's in Russia, who cares?'""","Sochi 2014 came to a spectacular close with Sunday's closing ceremony .

"(CNN) -- Jersey, Guernsey, Holstein; the world's dairy cattle breeds bear the names of some of the wettest, lushest, and greenest places in Europe, testament to the fact that to produce milk you need a lot of water. Industry experts say one cow must consume three liters of water a day to produce one liter of milk. For high-performing cattle that's equal to 150 liters a day. Saudi Arabia --with an average annual rainfall of just 2.3 inches (59mm) -- might seem an unlikely candidate to be among the world's top 10 dairy producers, but its mega-dairy Almarai has grown to be one of the biggest food producers in the Persian Gulf. Leslie Butler, a dairy economist at the University of California, says the vast milking plants that dot the Persian Gulf region employ an industry standard known as the ""Californian model"" to run dairies in some of the driest regions of the world. ""The Californian model is simply that you don't have to grow all your grass and raise your own feed crops, you can import feed and water and all your input and house a thousand head of dairy cattle on just 40 acres of land,"" Butler told CNN. He said as long as the water and feed could be sourced, then dairy operations of this type were sustainable. ""The other side of sustainable, of course, is whether they get the price they want for the milk they produce, but I assume that they do,"" he said. From food security to big exports . Established with the help of Irish agribusiness pioneers Alastair and Paddy McGlucklin in 1977, Almarai began modestly with just 300 head of cattle as part of a Saudi push to achieve food security through self-sufficiency -- a government response to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Forty years later and the company is a diversified regional giant selling juices, poultry, baked products and infant formula. With a total herd of 135,000 dairy cattle, Almarai's installation at Al Kharj 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital Riyadh, houses one of its largest herds of 67,000. The company's statistics are staggering: the entire herd produces 2.5 million liters of milk a day -- an average of 40 liters per cow per day roughly double the European average. Technology to beat the heat . The secret to making a dairy successful in one of the world's most arid environments is to apply technology -- and a lot of it. At normal desert temperatures that can reach as high 50 degrees Celsius, milk production would normally plummet, the produce would spoil quickly and dangerous bacteria would form. However, every step of the process of keeping the Holstein milking cows at a perfect temperature of between 21 and 23 degrees Celsius (70 and 73 degrees Fahrenheit) is automated. Read more: Dubai builds big for Expo 2020 . Overhead misters in the open-sided sheds that house the herds send out clouds of moisture that wet the flanks of the herd to keep them cool. Fans also keep them dry and prevent puddles from forming. As well as computers that monitor the temperature and humidity in the installations, workers put the cattle through stationary water jets - a process that ensures the milk is not contaminated with manure - before the cattle are milked four times daily. After the cows are milked, the mega-factory goes through the process of pasteurizing the dairy products, bottling and packaging it. Almarai's fleet of 1,000 refrigerated tankers then deliver it to 55,000 stores in six Gulf nations. Water worries . Saudi is not the only Gulf State to have automated its milk production. In the nearby United Arab Emirates, the Al Ain Dairy Farm, the largest in the UAE and a competitor to Almarai, has per cow yields at 10,000 liters a year, almost the equal of Almarai's 12,400 liters a year. However, critics warn that the high yields of Almarai and other Gulf dairies carry a cost. Seen from Google Earth, the irrigation pivots of Al Kharj stand out like green crop circles in the rocky brown of the desert. Just 40 years ago, Saudi Arabia's underground store of fossil water was estimated at 500 cubic kilometers, enough to fill Lake Erie, according to a report published by University of London SOAS. Read more: Oxford, Yale or Abu Dhabi? It estimates four-fifths of the aquifers are now depleted. With practically no rainfall to replenish them, it has been reported that the government intends to phase out wheat production by 2016. Many of the irrigation pivots at Al Kharj stand unused and the Saudi government is coy about their future. In the meantime, Saudi investment in land near the headwaters of the Nile in the Gambella region of Ethiopia has caused controversy. Human Rights Watch, in a 2012 report, said that foreign investors from Saudi and China had acquired large tracts of land and that it had evidence that some 70,000 indigenous people in the western Gambella region were relocated against their will to new villages that ""lack adequate food, farmland, healthcare and educational facilities"". The Oakland Institute, an NGO, issued a critical report on Saudi Star's Gambella investment in Ethiopia in June last year, alleging that the company failed to conduct an environmental impact assessment and that residents reported the threat of force from Ethiopian authorities if they did not resettle. Meanwhile, the Saudi government has denied that its investment in the region has uprooted the region's indigenous people. ""I never heard of even a single displacement,"" Saudi Agriculture Minister Dr Fahd bin Abdulrahman Balghunaim said in media reports. ""If you or any other correspondent will show us a clear displacement or land grab or whatever by Saudi investment, please let us know. I assure you there are none whatsoever.""","Saudi Arabian dairy has become one of the biggest in the region .

"(CNN) -- A suspected mumps outbreak in New Jersey is linked to a Jersey shore nightclub, officials say. The Monmouth County Health Department issued a statement on Thursday saying it is investigating 22 ""probable cases"" of the contagious disease that is spread through saliva. Officials say 21 of those infected are adults who had recently been at D'Jais Bar & Grill in Belmar, a place that says on its website that it is ""one of the Jersey shore's most talked about venues."" CNN was not able to reach D'Jais for comment on Thursday. It was not immediately clear how the one sick person not connected to D'Jais -- a child -- became infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that mumps ""typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite."" After that, symptoms include salivary gland swelling. There is no cure or specific treatment for mumps. The CDC says most people with mumps recover fully, although there can be complications.","22 people infected with ""probable cases"" of mumps, officials say .

"(Martha Stewart Living) -- My interest in the traditional Irish-American meal served in celebration of St. Patrick's Day began when I was a schoolgirl living on Elm Place in Nutley, New Jersey. Martha Stewart Living: 15 kitchen shortcuts that will change the way you cook . Our street was populated by a diverse assortment of families. There were Jews, Catholics and Episcopalians and other Protestants. There were Polish, Irish, German, English and Scottish homeowners. This diversity contributed to my interest in understanding how people of different religions and nationalities celebrated holidays and rites of passage. Big Martha was also very interested in all holidays and was always looking to expand her cooking repertoire. The Rebenacks were a large Irish family (there were six kids, with whom we all felt a kinship) who lived across the street. I loved visiting my friend Barbara, the eldest daughter, in their stark, almost empty kitchen (a contrast to our cozy and very busy one). A favorite snack after school was a perfect baked potato snitched from under the aluminum dome of the stove-top roaster where Mrs. Rebenack cooked her family's daily potatoes. Martha Stewart Living: 19 tips for perfect laundry every time . The first time I tasted the St. Patrick's Day feast at the Rebenacks, I ran home and begged my mother to cook the exact same menu -- Irish soda bread with salted butter, corned brisket of beef simmered with big, round boiling potatoes, huge wedges of winter cabbage, giant bright-orange carrots, and chunks of pale-orange rutabagas, served with freshly grated horseradish and spicy yellow mustard. We went to the Nutley Co-op and purchased a big corned brisket and all the fixings. The brisket was corned by the store's butcher. He had his own recipe for brining the meat in a large crock in the back of the store. Martha Stewart Living: 20 super-efficient, super-effective ways to clean all the things . The word corned had nothing to do with the vegetable, the butcher told us, but rather with the large kernel-size pieces of salt that customarily went into the brine. The butcher also gave us tips on how to cook it: rinsing the brisket, boiling it, draining it, and then simmering the beef slowly, until tender. The vegetables were cooked separately, some in the simmering liquid, and the potatoes and turnips in their own pots of fresh, salted water. Mother made a great soda bread, filled with caraway seeds and currants. Martha Stewart Living: Instant organization: Get it together in 15 minutes or less . For years after that, we always celebrated St. Patrick's Day with a big traditional feast. My sister Laura Plimpton always makes it for her family, adding parsnips. My friend Torie Hallock, in Somesville, Maine, and her husband, Compton, actually turned me on to corning my own beef. The soda bread is a delicious, crumbly version I created one morning when I had few ingredients in my larder and needed to make several loaves for the Irish in my life. Martha Stewart Living: Don't shelve these clever bookshelf decorating ideas . Kevin Sharkey just has to have soda bread and Irish butter on St. Patrick's Day, as does Christine O'Neill, my new assistant, who also plays the bagpipes and drinks Guinness dyed green. My hairdresser and makeup artist, Mary Curran, loves Reuben sandwiches made from her mother's leftover corned beef.

"Boston (CNN) -- A Harvard University student charged with making bomb threats that led school officials to delay some final exams, including his, was released Wednesday with bail set at $100,000. Eldo Kim, 20, of Cambridge, allegedly e-mailed bomb threats at about 8:30 a.m. Monday to offices associated with Harvard, including the Harvard University Police Department and the Harvard Crimson, the student-run daily newspaper. He made his first appearance in U.S. District Court in South Boston on Wednesday and was told he could only return to the Harvard campus with an escort once to retrieve his belongings. Kim was led into court in handcuffs and wearing a pair of dark sweatpants with ""Harvard"" written in large letters down the left leg and a gray T-shirt. He was very quiet during proceedings. After each question from the judge, he answered ""Yes, your honor."" Kim, who has a public defender, was released to his sister, who lives in the Boston area, and uncle. According to the five-page criminal complaint filed against Kim, the subject line in each of the messages sent Monday read ""bombs placed around campus"" and cited ""shrapnel bombs"" in four buildings on the school's main campus in Cambridge. ""2/4. guess correctly. be quick or they will go off soon,"" the messages said, according to the complaint. The Harvard police called in the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Secret Service; the Cambridge Police Department and the Boston Police Department along with numerous other first responders, including the Cambridge Fire Department. The buildings were evacuated and swept by bomb technicians and hazardous materials officers, and access to Harvard Yard was restricted to students with Harvard IDs, according to the Harvard Gazette, the school's official news website. Shortly before 3 p.m. Monday, long after Kim's exam had been canceled for the day, officials concluded that the threats were a hoax and reopened the buildings. ""Those who missed their exams due to the evacuation should be in touch with administrators about a makeup date or other arrangement,"" the Gazette said. The e-mail messages had been sent through a service called Guerrilla Mail, which creates temporary and anonymous e-mail messages, according to the complaint. And the person had used a product called TOR, which assigns an anonymous Internet protocol address that can be used to hide the identity of the sender, it added. But the sender failed to do that, according to the complaint. ""Harvard University was able to determine that, in the several hours leading up to the receipt of the e-mail messages described above, Eldo Kim accessed TOR using Harvard's wireless network,"" it said. The Crimson identified Kim as a sophomore. An FBI agent and an officer with the Harvard University Police Department interviewed Kim Monday night at his campus residence, where he ""stated that he authored the bomb threat e-mails"" and said he had acted alone, the complaint says. ""According to Kim, he was motivated by a desire to avoid a final exam scheduled to be held on (Monday),"" the complaint said. He is to appear Wednesday in U.S. District Court before District of Massachusetts Chief Judge Judith G. Dein. In a statement, school officials said they were ""saddened by the details alleged in the criminal complaint"" but had no further comment. If convicted, the student could face a maximum of five years in prison, three years of suspended release, and a $250,000 fine. On Wednesday, Kim waived his right to a probable cause hearing, surrendered his U.S. passport and was ordered to stay in Massachusetts. After his court appearance, he hurried past reporters without commenting.","A Harvard sophomore is accused of sending phony e-mail threats to avoid final exam .

"(CNN) -- They are six of the most powerful words in the English language: . ""The doctor will see you now."" Physicians themselves rarely hear them. But to the people who do -- the patients in the waiting room -- they can spur emotions ranging from hope to fear to gratitude to anxiety to dread. Which is why what has happened, in recent years, as patients step into examining rooms has had such a profound effect on the experience of a visit to the doctor. There have been two changes, prompted by federal initiatives whose genesis predated the Affordable Care Act, that have altered a comforting routine essential to the physician-patient relationship for centuries. The doctor today is not likely to look for long into the eyes of the patient. As the physician begins asking questions and taking a history, he or she may be tapping away at a computer keyboard, peering at the screen, entering information as the patient responds to queries. It can be jarring, the first time a patient encounters it. The importance of eye contact with a doctor does not become evident until it's gone. There is a reason that physicians have shifted their eyes away from their patients and toward those screens; it is not that the doctors have cavalierly decided to become rude. The mandated use of electronic medical records, with the government providing cash incentives for physicians who agree to use them, and threats of eventual penalties for those who don't, has forced doctors, many of them reluctantly, to become data-entry clerks as they conduct their examinations. This matters, and not in a good way. There is something about the presumed intimacy of a conversation with one's doctor -- of patient and physician looking into each others' eyes, with the physician reading the expression on the patient's face as well as listening to the patient's words -- that is key to what medical care, with the emphasis on ""care,"" has always been about. Part of this may be mutually understood illusion; on some level the patient is aware that the doctor probably has a half-dozen patients, right at this moment, in examining rooms up and down the hallway, waiting for his or her attention. But the time that one spends with the doctor is supposed to feel like a heart-to-heart conversation, one human being talking about exceedingly private things to another. The patient has made plans for this visit, has traveled to it, has come prepared with a list of concerns and worries. When the doctor, obedient to 21st-century regulations, turns away and begins to communicate not with the patient but with a screen, something intangible and consequential is lost. Is the doctor really seeing you now? The changes have been instituted in the name of efficiency: ""evidence-based decision support,"" ""quality management,"" ""streamlining the clinician's workflow,"" among other jargon used to justify the decreed new methods. Electronic records can make coordination between a patient's various physicians more seamless, can provide information about a patient's history quickly in emergencies, can be helpful in ascertaining that treatment options being considered in different offices do not duplicate or conflict with each other. And, without question, as the world moves from records kept on paper to digital storage, revisions in the workings of doctors' offices were necessary. Yet as medical organizations, insurance companies and the federal government all make their cases for what works best, the one constituency -- such a cold word -- that seems to be left out is the patients. Some of whom have always felt a little awkward raising questions about what goes on in their physicians' offices. It is not easy, in that examining room, for a woman or a man to say to the doctor: ""Could you please look at me when we talk?"" Some doctors -- the ones who can afford it -- have come up with what seems to be a solution to the new regulations. Transcriptionists, sometimes referred to as scribes, have been retained to move with the doctor from one examining room to the next, carrying laptop computers or tablets, listening as the doctor and patient speak, typing the requisite information. This allows the doctor to talk with the patient the old way: eye-to-eye. But it creates a different problem. There is a stranger in the room. For some, perhaps many, patients, the kinds of things they want to discuss with their longtime doctor are not the kinds of things they want to say in front of third parties. That illusion of intimacy, again, that feeling of privacy -- it becomes broken. The elderly patient who may have been going to the same doctor for decades, now being expected to sit, undressed, in the presence not just of that trusted doctor, but of a transcriptionist listening in and clicking keys ... something is lost. The best and most compassionate doctors can make anything work. They do it every day. But the bureaucrats, however well-intentioned, who came up with these changes may have lost sight of another time-honored phrase in the healing arts, the most sacrosanct of all. It refers to the general practice of medicine, but it also applies to the doctor-patient relationship: . First, do no harm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Doctors taking notes on computer interferes with doctor-patient visit .
He says electronic records mandate may keep them from assessing patient visually .
He says visits are precious opportunities for face-to-face discussion .
Greene: Doctors must find a way to solve this for the sake of doctor-patient relationship ."
"(CNN) -- Five-year-old Jeremiah Oliver was last seen by his Massachusetts relatives on September 14. But the investigation into his disappearance didn't begin until last week when the authorities were first alerted to it. Now, the child is feared dead, his mother and her boyfriend are in custody, and everyone is left wondering how a child could simply vanish unnoticed for three months. How could this happen, especially to a child who was supposed to be receiving monthly visits from a state-provided social worker? Turns out, tragically, Jeremiah was not getting the visits, state officials say. Who's to blame? The finger pointing, demands for accountability and calls for investigations are reverberating throughout the state. ""This is a deeply concerning case of neglect and abuse,"" said Olga Roche, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families. The state agency was charged with the responsibility of protecting children from child abuse. Roche called the situation ""a serious failure"" and put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the boy's social worker and supervisor, both of whom were quickly fired. ""The social worker assigned to this case did not conduct the required in-person, monthly checks on the family,"" Roche said in a statement. ""And the supervisor failed to enforce that policy."" Neither the social worker nor the supervisor have been named, but their union spokesman says they have been made ""convenient scapegoats"" at an overwhelmed agency. ""We are disappointed that Commissioner Roche is more interested in finger-pointing than accepting responsibility for yet another tragedy on her watch,"" said Jason Stephany of the Service Employees International Union Local 509, which represents caseworkers at the Department of Children and Families. ""Instead, the Commissioner has chosen a convenient scapegoat to deflect blame from department administrators."" More blame to go around . But Gov. Deval Patrick hinted Friday that they might not be the only two held accountable. ""I've asked the Commissioner to look into the question about whether responsibility goes beyond those two,"" he said in an appearance on Boston Public Radio. ""I have some reason to believe it does."" The last documentation of an interaction with Jeremiah was in May, according to Department of Children and Families spokesman Alec Loftus. In June, Loftus says the social worker was told that Jeremiah had moved to Florida to live with his grandmother, but never bothered to follow up or verify whether that was the case. The last time a visit to the home occurred was in November, at which Loftus says the social worker left behind a business card indicating that this would be DCF's final visit. Just days later, on December 2, Jeremiah's 8-year-old sister disclosed to counselors at her elementary school that her mom's boyfriend, Alberto Sierra, 22, had abused her, according to a police affidavit. Multiple calls to Sierra's attorney have gone unreturned. ""As a result of those statements"" the affidavit continues, ""[she] and [another brother that isn't Jeremiah] were removed from the home and taken into protective custody."" When cops asked Elsa Oliver, 28, where her third child Jeremiah was, she told them that he had moved to Florida, a law enforcement source involved in the investigation told CNN. This time, however, she was going to have to prove it. Where is Jeremiah? Oliver went before a state juvenile judge at a hearing on December 13, where she was ""observed to have bruises, disheveled hair, and appeared to have been assaulted,"" according to court documents. She refused to divulge Jeremiah's whereabouts, according to the source. The judge ordered her to produce the child within 72 hours. The time passed with no sign of Jeremiah. Oliver was arrested. The mother has been charged with two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of accessory after the fact of a felony (assault and battery with a dangerous weapon), according to a statement from Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early. A plea of not guilty was entered on her behalf. Those charges may not necessarily pertain to Jeremiah and more details could emerge at a December 24 hearing, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said. Elsa Oliver's attorney, James Gavin Reardon, wasn't able to elaborate either. ""I met with her for 10 hours and was unable to obtain any significant information"" Reardon said, prompting him to seek a mental health evaluation to determine whether she was even competent enough to stand charges. He says that evaluation is currently underway. Sierra, meanwhile, is charged with two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and two counts of assault and battery on a child causing bodily injury, according to the district attorney's office said. A plea of not guilty was also entered on his behalf. He also has a hearing scheduled for December 24. For now, authorities are holding out hope that Jeremiah might be out there somewhere, and they're asking anyone who might know anything to call the Massachusetts State Police.","Jeremiah Oliver was last seen in September .

"(CNN) -- Only two people know how the affair started, but the world knows now about its inglorious end. Admitting to the extramarital affair, David Petraeus stepped down as director of the CIA on Friday in a surprise move that shocked the intelligence community just days after President Barack Obama was re-elected. Immediate praise for the man poured in. The president hailed Petraeus' dedication and patriotism, while leaders from both parties said he would be missed. It appeared an abrupt end to a spectacularly successful career in public service. ""After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours,"" Petraeus said in a letter to colleagues, explaining his decision to step down. ""Teddy Roosevelt once observed that life's greatest gift is the opportunity to work hard at work worth doing. I will always treasure my opportunity to have done that with you and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end,"" he said. According to a U.S. official, the FBI had a tip that Petraeus was involved with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, and investigated the alleged affair to determine whether it posed a security risk. The FBI was not investigating Petraeus for wrongdoing. The concern was that he could potentially be blackmailed or put ""in a vulnerable spot,"" the official said. Broadwell spent a year with Petraeus in Afghanistan interviewing him for the book she co-wrote, ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus."" It is not clear whether Broadwell is the woman with whom Petraeus has admitted having an affair. CNN has not been able to reach Broadwell for comment. Other sources close to the CIA director told HLN anchor Kyra Phillips that the woman involved in the affair was not under Petraeus' command. The woman was not a member of the armed forces and not a CIA employee, they said. Petraeus, 60, had a distinguished 37-year career in the military before joining the CIA, helping turn the tide against insurgents while commanding forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Earning praise from both sides of the political aisle, the retired four-star general took the helm of the CIA in September 2011. Politicians react to the resignation . Director of National Intelligence James Clapper hailed Petraeus, saying his ""decision to step down represents the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants."" Petraeus met with Obama on Thursday to offer his resignation and explain the circumstances behind it, according to a senior administration official. The president accepted Petraeus' resignation during a phone call Friday, said the official. ""By any measure, he was one of the outstanding general officers of his generation, helping our military adapt to new challenges and leading our men and women in uniform through a remarkable period of service in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he helped our nation put those wars on a path to a responsible end,"" Obama said in a statement. ""As director of the Central Intelligence Agency, he has continued to serve with characteristic intellectual rigor, dedication and patriotism."" The president expressed confidence that the CIA will continue to move forward, under the direction of Acting Director Michael Morell. Morell, a career agency officer, was sworn in as deputy director of the CIA in May 2010. He previously served as associate deputy director and director for intelligence. Petraeus assumed command of the NATO International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces Afghanistan in July 2010, after serving for more than 20 months as commander of United States Central Command. He previously commanded multinational forces in Iraq, leading the so-called surge. The general literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency techniques by overseeing development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. Before his nomination as CIA director, Petraeus was considered the nation's most well-known and popular military leader since Colin Powell. But his reputation was potentially tarnished by the controversy over the terror attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in September. Petraeus was expected to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week on the Benghazi attack. Morell will take his place, according to the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is chairman of that committee. ""I wish President Obama had not accepted this resignation, but I understand and respect the decision. David Petraeus is one of America's best and brightest, and all Americans should be grateful for his service,"" she said. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, described Petraeus as a ""true American patriot."" ""This is a real loss for the country; a real loss for the CIA,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett. Petraeus and his wife, Holly, live in Virginia. They have two grown children. CNN's Carol Cratty, Terry Frieden, Suzanne Kelly and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","David Petraeus, a retired four-star general, led forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Once again, the head of world soccer has put his foot in his mouth. Sepp Blatter, the man who infamously said that racism on the pitch could be settled by a handshake, has been forced to apologize to Cristiano Ronaldo after apparently mocking the Real Madrid and Portugal star. When asked at a question and answer session at an English university last Friday if he preferred Ronaldo or his rival Lionel Messi, the FIFA president at first said he could not decide. However, after extolling the virtues of Barcelona's ""good boy"" Messi, he stood up and gave the audience at Oxford a bizarre impersonation of Ronaldo, calling him ""a commander on the field of play"" and then claimed he spent ""a lot more at the hairdresser's."" Blatter concluded: ""I like both of them, but I prefer Messi."" Ronaldo, who was named Tuesday with Messi among 23 candidates for FIFA's 2013 Ballon d'Or world player of the year award, posted a response on social media along with a link to footage of Blatter's performance. ""This video shows the respect and consideration that FIFA has for me, my club and my country. Much is explained now,"" Ronaldo wrote to his 22.2 million Twitter followers and 64 million ""likers"" on Facebook. ""I wish Mr. Blatter health and a long life, with the certainty that he will continue to witness, as he deserves, the successes of his favorite teams and players."" Ronaldo won the 2008 world player of the year title for his exploits at Manchester United, but has seen Messi claim it every year since his world-record $130 million transfer to Spain. He has been runner-up four times, and was particularly aggrieved to miss out after helping Real end Barca's La Liga reign in the 2011-12 season. Blatter's antics brought condemnation from Real, whose coach Carlo Ancelotti said it was ""disrespectful."" ""He shows every day that he is a great player and he respects everyone,"" the Italian said of Ronaldo, who has scored more than 200 goals in just over four seasons at Real . Madrid president Florentino Perez, who signed Ronaldo, wrote a letter to FIFA complaining about the player's treatment by a man who is a ""socio"" (honorary member) of the club -- which represented Spain as one of the ruling body's founder members back in 1904. ""It that has been a huge disappointment among the Madridista family, especially since these unfortunate and unacceptable manifestations come from the president of world football's governing body,"" Perez wrote. ""On the one hand, they are unfair to a football player who has millions of fans around the world. This is without doubt one of the best players of all time. He embodies the values of sport in a society certainly in need of these kind of examples. ""Finally, we understand that your comments may influence the votes of those who have to decide on who should receive the award."" Blatter wrote to Ronaldo via Twitter, saying: ""I apologize if you were upset by my light-hearted answer at private event on Friday. I never meant to offend you."" He also sent a reply to Real, which the club published on its website. ""In response to a question about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the moderator asked me to choose between one of the two and, in this moment having commented that Messi is the type of son all mothers would like to have, I ended up saying his name,"" Blatter explained. ""However, I want to make it clear that for me Cristiano Ronaldo is at the same level as Messi and that they are both exceptional players, each one in their own way. ""It was never my intention to upset or show a lack of respect towards Real Madrid, one of their players or their fans."" Meanwhile, Barcelona moved four points clear in Spain with a 3-0 win at Celta Vigo on Tuesday. Messi was not able to add to his eight La Liga goals this season, leaving him joint second with Ronaldo, but he helped set up Cesc Fabregas' second goal. Fabregas had earlier curled in off the bar to make it 2-0, while his blocked shot allowed Alexis Sanchez to net an early opener. Espanyol moved up to eighth despite being held 0-0 at home by struggling Sevilla. Real will host Sevilla on Wednesday and second-placed city rival Atletico Madrid will travel to Granada Thursday. In Italy, fourth-placed Inter Milan failed to close the gap significantly on the Serie A leaders after being held 1-1 at Atalanta. It left Walter Mazzari's team eight points adrift of top side Roma, which hosts Chievo on Thursday. In England, Chelsea knocked Premier League leader Arsenal out of the League Cup with a 2-0 win in north London. Fullback Cesar Azpilicueta took advantage of a defensive mixup to net the first-half opener and fellow Spaniard Juan Mata doubled the lead in the second spell with a superb right-foot shot. Manchester United reached the quarterfinals with a 4-0 win over EPL struggler Norwich, as Mexico striker Javier Hernandez scored twice, but Fulham's poor season continued with a 4-3 defeat at second division Leicester. Birmingham also scored four against Premier League Stoke, but lost out 4-2 on penalties following extra time, while West Ham won 2-0 at second division leader Burnley.","Sepp Blatter apologizes after impersonating Cristiano Ronaldo at a student address .

"(CNN) -- A lawyer who says he was defamed by his portrayal in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is demanding the Oscar-nominated film be removed from theaters. Andrew Greene's lawsuit is also asking for ""in excess of"" $25 million in damages from the filmmakers, who he said made him look like ""a criminal, drug user, degenerate, depraved, and/or devoid of any morality or ethics."" The movie, which is up for five Academy Awards, was based on the 2007 memoir by Jordon Belfort, the founder of the over-the-counter securities brokerage. Greene, a lifelong friend of Belfort, served as the firm's head of corporate finance in the 1990s. The federal lawsuit said it was ""readily apparent"" that the character Nicky ""Rugrat"" Koskoff, played by actor P.J. Byrne, was based on Greene. ""In one scene, Mr. Greene's character is depicted shaving a woman's head after Jordan Belfort's character states the woman was offered $10,000,"" the complaint said. Another scene suggested that Greene's character was arrested with a Swiss banker and that he arranged a meeting with the banker to help Belfort launder money, the suit said. ""Mr. Greene's character is shown doing cocaine on company premises during business hours in another scene,"" the suit said. ""The motion picture included other scenes depicting Mr. Greene's character in a reckless and depraved manner, including more than one scene wherein his character is depicted having sexual relations with a prostitute."" Greene's real-life nickname is ""Wigwam,"" because he often wears a hairpiece, the complaint said. It criticizes the film for mocking his toupee in an ""egregiously offensive manner."" The movie has ""permanently damaged"" Greene's professional and personal reputation by portraying him as ""a criminal and drug user with misogynistic tendencies."" ""Mr. Greene will be permanently linked to the crimes and loathsome behavior portrayed by his likeness in the motion picture, despite never having been interviewed, questioned, charged, imprisoned, or even arrested for the illicit and despicable behavior shown in the motion picture,"" the complaint said.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Navy SEALs have taken control of a commercial tanker that had been seized by three armed Libyans this month. In response to the U.S. operation, a leader of the armed federalist group that seized oil ports in east Libya last year released a statement on Monday. In that statement, Ibrahim Jadran said the tanker was legally hired -- not hijacked -- and accused the United States of violating international maritime law by seizing and boarding the vessel. No one was hurt in the Sunday night operation, the Pentagon said. The tanker, Morning Glory, is carrying oil owned by Libya's National Oil Company. The ship was returning to Libya, according to a written statement from the interim prime minister, which said Tripoli asked for help from countries in the area. The statement thanked the United States and Cyprus. Another leader of the rebel group said this was not a setback. ""We consider this to be a victory because the world will be discussing our cause at the (U.N.) Security Council now,"" said Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi. The Morning Glory sailed last week from the rebel-held port of As-Sidra in eastern Libya . Libyan forces fired on the vessel but were called off by the U.S. Navy, fearing an environmental disaster. The SEALs boarded the ship in international waters southeast of Cyprus, the Pentagon said. The situation remains unsettled in the North African nation, which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. In this case, the issue centers around the oil-rich eastern part of the country and, in particular, Jadran. The militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports. But in July, Jadran and his men seized them, blocking oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region. He said he acted because the government is corrupt. The conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears that Libya may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust Gadhafi in 2011 but now do as they please. Libya, rebels argue over who controls oil tanker -- and Libya's oil .

"(CNN) -- After seven years of planning and construction costing over $150 million, Donald Trump's dream to open a golf course in Scotland was finally realized on Tuesday. The U.S.-based billionaire hit the ceremonial first tee shot at Trump International Golf Links, having weathered a storm of controversy involving environmentalists, local residents and politicians. ""It's been worth it,"" he told CNN during his rain and wind-swept round at the venue. ""This is truly the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Everybody knows it. Most people are saying it and most of the golf people are saying it, most importantly."" Trump welcomed guests from the European Tour and the Ryder Cup organizing committee, and told them: ""There's really nothing like it."" Set on the east coast of Scotland, eight miles north of the city of Aberdeen, the course occupies part of the private Menie Estate, bought by Trump in 2006. The opening of the championship course is the first step towards the American tycoon's goal of creating a resort featuring a second golf course, a hotel, luxury holiday homes and a residential village. Trump expects the total bill for the development to exceed a billion dollars, although the next stage of building is currently on hold while he contests plans to build an offshore wind farm nearby. Rarely has a new golf course had such criticism and hype. Accusations of bullying from local residents and objections from environmental groups were documented in the movie ""You've Been Trumped,"" while sport writers have been thrilled at every new photo revealing the dramatic holes. The sheer amount of money pumped into the project enabled English golf architect Martin Hawtree to manipulate the land on an unprecedented scale. ""This is one of the most extraordinary golf links sites you have seen or will ever see,"" Hawtree said at the opening ceremony. ""There is no doubt in my mind it will be in the top three in the world. I just don't know who'll be number two or three!"" Before the opening, Golf World magazine announced that the course has gone straight into its UK course rankings at number eight, ahead of several British Open venues including Royal Lytham & St. Annes, which will host the golf season's third major tournament next week. Trump's ultimate goal is to bring a major tournament to his latest course, and the European Tour chief executive George O'Grady hinted that it may not be far away. ""Great courses need great tournaments,"" said O'Grady, ""We will work with Mr. Trump to bring the right event here."" Sandy Jones of the Great Britain and Ireland Professional Golfers' Association made the only reference to the saga of controversy and criticism around the course's planning: . ""Golf is a responsible business. It embraces the environment. I wish the environmentalists would embrace golf,"" he said. On the course, Trump was joined by one of the European Tour's most successful players, Colin Montgomerie, who described the course as ""dramatic and spectacular."" On the question of whether Trump International will ever host the British Open or a Ryder Cup event, the Scottish golfer was optimistic. ""There's no doubt that tournament golf will come here,"" the 49-year-old former European Ryder Cup captain said. ""It's a fantastic opportunity for people locally, nationally and internationally to come to this area."" Trump championed his Scottish family ties throughout the planning process, and continued the theme at the opening ceremony as he gave out whiskey and shortbread to invited guests. The tale of how an American billionaire's dream became reality across the pond has made Trump International Golf Links one of the hottest tickets of the summer, with tee times already in short supply. The course opens to the public on Sunday, with green fees costing $310 on a weekend or $233 on a weekday, the same price as the summer rate on the prestigious Old Course at St. Andrews, known as ""the home of golf.""","Donald Trump's Scottish golf course cost $150 million to create .

"(CNN) -- The Spanish title race is shaping up to be one of the closest in years -- and the battle for the ""Pichichi"" is also hotting up. While Atletico Madrid matched the 1-0 victory by league-leading city rival Real on Saturday, Diego Costa kept in touch with Cristiano Ronaldo at the top of the La Liga scoring charts by emulating the world player of the year's decisive strike. Ronaldo's first-half winner at Malaga meant Real will head into next weekend's ""El Clasico"" clash with defending champion Barcelona holding a three-point advantage over second-placed Atletico. It was his 25th goal in the league this season and 39th in all competitions, with Ronaldo firing home in trademark style after cutting into the penalty area from the left following a crossfield pass from Gareth Bale. Ronaldo missed several other chances, and his collision with teammate Karim Benzema resulted in the France striker going off injured. ""We had chances to score the second goal but unfortunately we weren't able to get it and then when the score is 1-0 you always suffer,"" said coach Carlo Ancelotti. ""It wasn't a great game in terms of how we played, but we showed good attitude and were very solid defensively."" Brazil-born Costa, hoping to win a World Cup place this year with his adopted Spain, netted for the 22nd time in the league -- and 30th overall -- as he broke clear of the visiting Espanyol defense 10 minutes after halftime and coolly beat the keeper. The Madrid clubs are moving clear of Barca, who are seven points behind Real ahead of Sunday's home clash with Osasuna. Lionel Messi has won the Pichichi Trophy for the past two years, but is 10 behind Ronaldo after an injury-hit season so far. The Argentine is not even Barcelona's top scorer in the league -- that honor goes to Chile's Alexis Sanchez, who has 16. In Saturday's other matches, Celta Vigo won 1-0 at fellow midtable side Levante while Rayo Vallecano moved three points clear of the relegation zone with a 3-1 win over second-bottom Almeria. German Bundesliga . Champions Bayern Munich moved 23 points clear at the top of the table with a 2-1 win at home to fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen, meaning coach Josep Guardiola could win his first league title with the club next weekend with eight matches to spare. Goals from Mario Mandzukic and Bastian Schweinsteiger helped the European champions shrug off the midweek jailing of club president Uli Hoeness for tax evasion, as Stefan Kiessling's late consolation could not prevent Bayern's 16th successive league win. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund suffered a 2-1 home defeat by Borussia Monchengladbach, and Jurgen Klopp's team will surrender the title race if more points are dropped next weekend. Schalke, who moved up to third with Friday's 2-1 win over Augsburg, must also win to stop Bayern clinching a second successive title -- and 24th overall. Dortmund's defeat meant Schalke closed to within a point of their rivals ahead of the derby clash on March 25. Italian Serie A . Inter Milan moved up to fourth place with a 2-0 win at Verona, thanks to goals from Argentine forward Rodrigo Palacio and Brazilian defender Jonathan. It was the third win in a row for Walter Mazzarri's side, but Fiorentina can reclaim the Europa League berth by beating Chievo Verona on Sunday. French Ligue 1 . Third-placed Lille missed a chance to close the gap on Monaco in second after being held 0-0 at home by Nantes. Monaco travel to fifth-placed Lyon on Saturday, while champions Paris Saint-Germain will seek to extend an eight-point advantage at the top against fourth side St. Etienne.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores winner at Malaga to maintain Real Madrid's lead .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It may have taken the ""right stuff"" -- a macho blend of youthful bravado and reckless adrenaline -- to get the first people into space, but if you want to be an astronaut today, be warned, it's no longer a young man's game. ESA's Columbus lab is attached to the International Space Station. ""Forty five is the best astronaut age,"" says Gerhard Thiele, an experienced spaceman who, as flight operations chief for Europe's answer to NASA, now commands a team with an average age of 50. You wouldn't know it to look at the fresh-faced applicants who turned out at the launch of an European Space Agency recruitment drive in London on Thursday, but age is clearly an issue for would-be astronauts among the thousands ESA hopes to attract. While successful candidates are expected to visit the International Space Station in the near future -- spending up to six weightless months cruising above Earth's atmosphere in ESA's new Columbus lab -- they won't fulfill the ultimate goal of visiting the moon, and eventually Mars, until much later in their careers. ""Let's make the assumption that humans will be walking on the moon in the 2020s, if you look at the age of the applicants -- let's start with 35 -- in 10 years from now they are aged 45, which is the best astronaut age,"" elaborates Thiele, still pushing the final frontier himself at the age of 54. And while you didn't exactly have to be a rocket scientist to join the original space missions (the U.S. Mercury and Apollo programs recruited many test pilots), if you want to stand a chance against other heavily-qualified applicants, it's certainly an advantage. ""I already have a masters degree in physics and astrophysics a PhD in astronomy, I'm a scuba diver, I speak basic beginner's to advanced Russian, and I have flying experience,"" one hopeful, Tracy Parker, tells CNN. ESA expects up to 50,000 people to apply to become one of its new astronauts when online applications go live on May 19. A rigorous battery of medical, psychological and physical tests is expected to whittle these down to a final 40. Even to make it to the prodding and poking stage, candidates will have had to brandish qualifications including, says ESA: ""A university degree in natural sciences, engineering or medicine, and preferable at least three years of related postgraduate professional experience, or flying experience as a pilot."" For those who make the cut, the pay is good, if not exactly out of this world. Astronauts will enjoy a basic salary of at least $80,000, but according to ESA human resources chief Frank Danesy, there is unlikely to be overtime for those six-month Space Station stints. ""There is no bonus for flying into space, other than flying into space itself."" he says. Would-be astronaut Parker, who has dedicated her life to becoming an astronaut since watching the movie ""Space Camp"" at the age of 12, insists blasting-off would be reward enough. Despite the likely stiff competition Parker, 29, says she ""hands down"" expects to one day make it into space. ""For so long I've looked up and seen the moon, and to actually get out there ... that's going to be such an amazing feeling."" ....................... Would you want to be an astronaut?

"(CNN) -- Some thought it was a bomb. Others thought it was the commuter train that runs behind their buildings jumping the tracks. It shook upper Manhattan for blocks -- and when it was over, a five-story apartment building and its neighbor were gone. After Wednesday morning's deadly building explosion in East Harlem, squads of firefighters dug through piles of shattered bricks and beams. Ladder trucks sprayed water into the gap where the buildings once stood. As Detective Martin Speechly, a New York police spokesman, put it: ""1644 Park Avenue appears not to be there anymore."" Along with that five-story apartment building, with a Latino evangelical church on the first floor, a neighboring piano store and the four floors above it collapsed in the blast. One nearby resident, Angelica Avila, told CNN she was trapped in her apartment down the block for a short time afterward. Her stepmother had to sneak in through the back to try and open the door for her, she said. ""My neighbors came banging on my door. I guess they were evacuating the building, and I couldn't get out -- my door was jammed,"" she said. ""Everything off my windowsill fell, and I guess the impact of the explosion jammed the door as well."" Something similar happened to Aisha Watts, who had just returned to her apartment in one of the adjoining buildings after taking her children to school. Then the windows broke out, and ""the walls came tumbling down,"" Watts said. A neighbor helped her out of her apartment, because the door was stuck in its frame. And she and her neighbors will have to find someplace else to stay temporarily. ""We can't go back for the next couple of days,"" Watts said. Three blocks away, the blast knocked Klay Williams off his feet as he brushed his teeth before work. He told CNN's sister network HLN that his first thoughts were a possible terrorist attack, ""as New Yorkers, we tend to do,"" or maybe a derailment of the nearby Metro-North commuter line. ""I went to my back window, because I'm on the very top floor,"" he said. Looking down the street, he saw ""a bunch of people just running, as if they were running towards something."" Authorities suspect the explosion was the result of a gas leak reported a short time before. Seven blocks away, Eric Boise could feel his apartment shake and saw others ""pouring out of the apartment buildings at 116th and Madison Avenue."" He followed himself, watching as firefighters hauled gurneys into the wall of smoke to bring out the wounded. ""I can see in front of me about 50 feet up until the explosion, and then it gets pretty thick,"" Boise told CNN. Michael Mowatt-Wynn, the head of the Harlem & the Heights Historical Society, called the surrounding area ""a community in transition."" Its population of 100,000-plus was once largely Italian. In the late 1950s, large numbers of Puerto Ricans moved in -- in part because of the similarities between their native Spanish and the Italian still spoken there. The 1990s brought a growing Mexican population, and now the area is being gentrified, Mowatt-Wynn said. It's home to a lot of mom-and-pop businesses and restaurants, and the City University of New York-Hunter College is building a new dormitory in the area, he said. The full toll was uncertain early Wednesday afternoon, but at least three people had died, dozens were hurt and about 10 were unaccounted for. The suspected cause was a gas leak that had been reported only 15 minutes before the explosion, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters. ""This is a tragedy of the worst kind, because there was no indication in time to save people,"" he said. Among the missing was 67-year-old Carmen Tanco, whose nieces and godson awaited word near the ruins of her building. Liz Robinson said the family had given her aunt's name to the office of her city councilwoman, which was canvassing hospitals to track down the injured -- ""and she's still not on any of those lists."" ""She's a dedicated worker. She works at a doctor's office for many years now. So they're worried as well,"" Robinson said. ""They haven't heard from her. Today's her assigned day off."" Another niece, Marisela Frias, said her ""sassy, spicy"" aunt rarely fails to answer her phone -- ""and if she misses it because she didn't get to it in time, she calls me right back."" ""I'm hoping, thinking that the reason she hasn't been in one of the lists is because she's so involved helping somebody else that was injured from the building -- that she hasn't taken toll to herself because that's how she is,"" Frias said. CNN's Poppy Harlow, Rose Arce, Chris Kokenes and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Missing resident's family waits for news .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Carmen Zapata, whose most visible film role was as a choir nun in ""Sister Act,"" died Sunday at her Los Angeles home. She was 86. Zapata's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame honors her six decades of work on the stage, which began in New York in 1946. Her death from heart problems was confirmed by a representative at the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts in Los Angeles, which Zapata co-founded in 1973. She was ""an accomplished actress, translator, theater producer, and community leader who was knighted by King Juan Carlos of Spain,"" according to her biography on the group's website. Zapata, a Mexican-American born in New York, founded the theater group to promote bilingual stage productions. The goal was to ""instill cultural pride to Spanish-speaking audiences, and serve as an introduction to the rich and eloquent history of the diverse Hispanic culture to English-speaking audiences,"" the website said. She was 19 when she made her Broadway debut as a member of the chorus in ""Oklahoma."" She initially performed under the stage name Marge Cameron at a time when discrimination against Hispanic actors was more common. Her television and film résumé is slim until the 1970s, when she began landing acting jobs on series including ""Room 222,"" ""Bonanza"" and ""McMillan & Wife.""

"New York (CNN) -- A graffiti vandal hit the home owned by Spike Lee's father and a neighboring home in Brooklyn Friday -- days after the filmmaker's curse-filled rant against the gentrification enveloping his old neighborhood. The glass was shattered on the front door of the neighbor's home on Washington Park in the Fort Greene section, and ""Do the Right Thing,"" the title of Lee's controversial 1989 film about racial tension in Brooklyn, was spray-painted on the wall along with the Circle-A, the symbol for anarchy. Three words -- ""Do the Right"" -- were scrawled on stairs leading to jazz artist Bill Lee's brownstone next door. A police spokesman said the home was spray-painted early Friday. The act of vandalism is being investigated. Dianne Mackenzie, who has lived in the neighborhood for 17 years, said she discovered the vandalism on her Washington Park home Friday morning. She believes the damage is connected to Spike Lee's now-infamous anti-gentrification rant during an African-American History Month lecture on Tuesday. ""All I know is that he made a lot of comments that went viral, the next day my house is vandalized,"" Mackenzie told CNN. ""There is probably some kind of connection in the mind of whoever did this ... There is no reasonable reason for it. If this person has got something to say, fine say it. Don't damage my property."" Arnold Lee, who lives with his father, defended his half-brother's right to rant about gentrification but took issue with Spike Lee's reference to the family's Fort Greene home. ""Say what you want but leave the personal stuff out of it,"" he told CNN Friday. ""The moment you start going, 'Well, I live here,' and he doesn't live here. You know he lives in Manhattan so ... this is my dad's house, and it's kind of personal."" He added, ""Leave us out of it. Because I feel bad ... my neighbor, she is a good friend. In his rant, in which Lee mentioned that he once lived at 165 Washington Park, Lee also said his father, ""a great jazz musician,"" bought the brownstone 46 years ago. ""And the mother******' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father,"" Lee said. He's not â€” he doesn't even play electric bass. It's acoustic. We bought the mother******' house in 1968, and now you call the cops? In 2013?"" According to a New York Times article, police have received 17 noise complaints. The Times said a woman who lived next door had called most. Arnold Lee doesn't believe the vandalism was connected to the noise complaints. ""If it came from what he said, then it came from that,"" he said ""But there hasn't been a noise complaint in months."" Mackenzie, a retired computer programmer, said she was not behind the noise complaints. ""They are professional musicians next door,"" she said. ""They practice. They jam and their music is very good. I never had problems with the noise at all. And I was quoted in the paper saying that, and I never brought complaints. Maybe this has something to do with that. If it does, they got the wrong house."" Mackenzie, a retired computer programmer, said she is not concerned for her safety. ""We don't have this kind of thing happening in this neighborhood,"" she said. ""And that is upsetting in a way ... I don't think it's necessarily going to happen again."" Mackenzie said Fort Greene has always been vibrant and diverse, with many longtime home owners. ""It's always been a very mixed neighborhood, racially, culturally, socially,"" she said. ""It's retained that identity. It's also been a neighborhood that attracts a lot of people from the arts. And it still does. I don't think that the flavor of the neighborhood has changed. The people in it have changed, and where they come from maybe. A lot of people from Europe, people from Africa, we have people from all over in Fort Greene."" In his speech Tuesday at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, Lee vented his feelings about newcomers now inhabiting once-blighted parts of America's most populous city. ""And why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the South Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better? The garbage wasn't picked up every mother******* day when I was living in 165 Washington Park. ... The police weren't around. When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, three o'clock in the morning on 125th Street, that must tell you something."" On Wednesday, Lee told ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that he's not against new people moving into areas that were once predominantly poor and predominantly African-American. ""My problem is that when you move into a neighborhood, have some respect for the history, for the culture,"" Lee said. Not just Spike Lee's Brooklyn .

"(CNN) -- It's 10pm when the young men dressed in wetsuits rock up at Munich's hippest hangout. There's already a line of people waiting to get in. But it's not a cutting-edge bar or restaurant drawing the huge crowds -- it's a river. Welcome to the surreal world of urban surfing, where innovative thrill-seekers ride the waves of inner-city rivers. Munich's Eisbach River -- located in the heart of the German city -- is one of a growing number of urban surfing spots around the world. From China's industrial ports to land-locked Switzerland's stunning waterways, CNN takes a look at this mesmerizing -- and often dangerous -- extreme sport. German ingenuity . Munich may be 500 kilometers from the coast, but that hasn't stopped a thriving surfing community springing up around its legendary Eisbach River. For more than four decades, surfers have been riding the one-meter waves gushing beneath a six-lane highway rumbling with traffic. Even late at night, surfers can be found queuing up to jump in, with onlookers lining the bridge to catch a glimpse of the action below. The river, which runs through the city's picturesque English Gardens, is just 12-meters wide. But despite the small space, Eisbach is no easy ride, with only experienced surfers allowed to dive in. ""I'd surfed the ocean for five years, but river surfing is a totally different sport with a different movement,"" said Quirin Stamminger, editor of Eisbach River surfing zine. ""It's flowing so fast -- around 25 square meters of water per second. The wave is formed by fast water crashing into slow water. This creates the undercurrent which forms the tube."" Taming the Silver Dragon . Think ""surfing hotspot"" and it's unlikely China's Qiantang River springs to mind. But not only is the 460-kilometer river home to an annual festival attracting the best surfers from around the world, it's also the site of a rare wave phenomenon that has been mesmerizing tourists for centuries. Each autumn, a massive tidal bore -- a wave that travels against the current -- surges up the river. At nine-meters high and traveling at 40 kilometers per hour, the ""Silver Dragon,"" as it is known, is the largest tidal bore in the world and so powerful that only a small number of hefty commercial boats are allowed on the river at the same time. Watch: Aussie champ -- 'Surfing can be feminine' Now a group of American surfers has launched an annual festival on the river, using jet skis to reach the bore which pounds through the city of Hangzhou. Towering skyscrapers can be seen looming behind the daring surfers as they ride the murky Silver Dragon. ""Hundreds of thousands of people flock to Hangzhou during the Fall Equinox -- known as the Moon Festival -- every year to stand on the banks and watch this natural phenomenon barrel past,"" said Glenn Brumage, business director Wabsono International, a company promoting boardsports in China. ""The cityscape, the hundreds of thousands of people lining the banks, the exclusivity and just the fact that it's China all adds to the drama, excitement and allure of surfing the Qiantang."" No ocean? No problem . A small European country with no coastline hardly sounds like the destination of choice for surfing enthusiasts. But landlocked Switzerland -- with its snow-capped Alps -- is proving to be the ideal training ground for a new generation of surfers. ""We don't have any beaches, but we do have a culture of board riding,"" said Tino StÃ¤heli, president of the Swiss Surfing Association. ""We have snowboarding in winter, with many riders wanting to do a similar sport in summer."" Many villages in the country sit by a river flowing with icy water from the dramatic mountain range. An increasing number of surfers are now taking the plunge, with festivals held on the Reuss River flowing through the picturesque village of Bremgarten in the north of the country. Waves reach around one-meter in the pretty river. But be prepared to wait your turn -- on a nice day up to 40 people can be seen queuing for more than 30 minutes to ride the deep blue water.","No ocean? No problem.

""My dad worked as a sports reporter and he took me with him to an interview he did with a minigolf trainer. I tried to play there and really liked it. Apparently, I kept asking when we would go back to play more. ""Since then, I played regularly, and started going to tournaments."" Minigolf, commonly referred to as crazy golf, originated in 1867 at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews, Scotland. With women at the time keen to play the conventional game, and the violent swinging action required to hit a drive deemed most unladylike, an 18-hole course of putting greens was built. The rest, as they say, is history and 150 years later people from all over the world enjoy minigolf in a wide variety of locations on courses littered with tiny waterfalls and animatronic dinosaurs. It might not be as famous or well-known as the full-size game -- ""big golf,"" as Prokopova says -- but away from the fairways and bunkers of conventional courses is a hardcore community of players dedicated to golf's miniature cousin. And none are more dedicated than Bob Detwiler, the founder of the U.S. Pro Minigolf Federation. Detwiler opened the Hawaiian Rumble course in 1992 and decided to start holding tournaments. The first was the Masters in 1997, followed one year later by the U.S. Open. While the former is always held at Detwiler's course, the latter annually switches location, mirroring the long-established traditions of golf's equivalent tournaments. And the similarities have not been lost on those at Augusta National Golf Club, home since 1934 of what is now the season's opening major tournament. ""I've been called three of four times by the people at Augusta,"" explained Detwiler. ""They said I was infringing on their name and stuff. ""I said, 'How can that be? There's the Masters of tennis, of marbles. You name it, there's a Masters of it.' ""They asked me to do certain things, but they've never said I need to cease and desist."" The Hawaiian Rumble course -- ""our Augusta,"" boasts Detwiler -- annually attracts players from across the globe for the Masters, a tournament Prokopova has won in each of the last two years. While Adam Scott took home $1.44 million for his Green Jacket success in April, minigolf's event has a total prize fund of just $12,000. ""The season is expensive,"" admits Prokopova. ""Traveling to the U.S. is expensive. We usually go there three weeks to a month before a tournament. ""All prize money goes back into the travels, but I still need sponsors and my parents contribute to these trips."" Prokopova's commitment to the sport is unquestionable. Not only does she fly 4,500 miles to compete in the U.S., she is joined by an entourage including both of her parents, her coach and, if you believe Detwiler, even a masseuse. ""I was seven when I first traveled to the U.S. for a tournament,"" said Prokopova. ""The atmosphere was absolutely amazing. All the other players would stand around me and cheer, some of them screaming and jumping in the air."" Prokopova's fellow competitors tend to be middle-aged men who enjoy the heat of competition and the fraternity which comes with being an obscure sportsman. However Detwiler admits that some find losing to a teenage girl difficult to take. ""They've known her since she was seven years old, so they all like her,"" said Detwiler. ""But at the same time they want to win too. And they don't like it when some girl beats them!"" But the response to Propokova is almost entirely positive, with America's minigolf courses a home away from home for the prodigy. ""When at a tournament, it really feels like we are one big family,"" said Prokopova. ""We see each other regularly, at least twice a year, and we know each other. The players' community is very supportive, I don't feel much rivalry. ""I have once beaten the same player in sudden-death playoffs three times in row. He was a little upset and walked away briskly, but even then, he later came back and offered his congratulations. ""And that was the only time I could feel any sort of over-competitiveness."" As minigolf continues to grow, the sport's family could welcome more and more foreign members, with players from far and wide flocking to tournaments across the globe. ""The World Minigolf Federation is seeing a rise in player numbers, clubs and events and greater recognition of Minigolf as a sport,"" its sport director Pasi Aho told CNN. ""There are now 46 member nations in the World Minigolf Sport Federation, with South Korea and Mongolia our most recent members. ""With over 1,300 tournaments played each year, including World, European and Asian Championships, there are now 38,000 registered players competing in a wide range of tournaments."" For Prokopova, more major titles surely lie in wait. After all, she has won two green jackets before her 19th birthday, two more than 14-time major winner Woods had at that age. And Prokopova has set her sights on a showdown with ""big golf's"" biggest star. ""We have challenged Tiger Woods on several occasions, mainly through the media, but he never responded. Maybe he is afraid?!"" she joked. Over to you, Tiger... CNN's Ivana Kottasova contributed to this story.","The minigolf Masters takes place annually at the Hawaiian Rumble course .

"(CNN) -- If not for the hue of their skin or their ethnicity, 24 soldiers who faced death in service to their nation would have received the most prestigious medals for their valor long ago. But they were born and fought in a time when such deeds were not always fairly acknowledged. On Tuesday, the U.S. government corrected the oversight. President Barack Obama honored 24 Army veterans with the Medal of Honor -- the country's highest military award, given to American soldiers who display ""gallantry above and beyond the call of duty "" -- for their combat actions in Vietnam, Korea and World War II. ""No nation is perfect, but here ... we confront our imperfections and face a sometimes painful past, including the truth that some of these soldiers fought and died for a country that did not always see them as equal,"" Obama said. Only three of the soldiers are alive to receive the recognition. The rest -- soldiers with last names including Garcia and Weinstein and Negron -- are dead. Of the 24 honored, 10 never came home. The body of one -- Cpl. Joe Baldonado -- has never been recovered, Obama said. For the few who survive, such as Melvin Morris, this day has been more than 40 years in the making. He was fresh-faced and 19 when he volunteered to go to Vietnam. In 1969, the Army Green Beret ""charged into a hail of fire"" to save his injured comrades and retrieve the bodies of the fallen, even though he was shot several times and bleeding. The Army would later say his actions on the battlefield that day showed ""determination possessed by few men."" ""The staff sergeant recovered a fallen comrade ... and took out several bunkers even after he was shot several times,"" Obama said. He was honored in 1970 with the Army's Distinguished Service Cross award. Today, at age 72, Morris -- who is African-American -- received his nation's most esteemed military honor. ""It makes me very proud that they are going back and looking at records,"" Morris told CNN. But it was never about a medal for Morris, who joined the Army in 1959. On September 17, 1969, he was on a search-and-destroy mission with his company when he learned the commander of another company nearby had been killed. ""Immediately it came to me that I had to recover his body,"" Morris said. ""...Leave no man behind under any circumstance."" Morris was shot three times -- in the chest, arm and left ring finger -- as he carried the casualties out of the line of fire. He was then trapped in the firefight. ""The only thing I could do is fight, to hope I could get out,"" he said. And fight he did. He was later evacuated from the battlefield. Less than a year later, he returned to duty in Vietnam where he would be decorated again for his actions in combat. There are others, too. Men like Santiago J. Erevia, a radiotelephone operator from Texas who in 1969 tended injured comrades in Vietnam's Quang Tin province when his position came under attack. According to the citation, Erevia took out three machine gun bunkers with grenades and gunfire. He then returned to care for his wounded comrades, crawling from one wounded man to another to administer aid. And there were men like Jose Rodela, who, while commanding a mobile strike force in Vietnam's Phuoc Long province, ""was wounded in the back and head by rocket shrapnel while recovering a wounded comrade,"" according to a military commendation. Still he single-handedly assaulted and knocked out a mortar position before returning to lead his men. Morris, Rodela and Erevia wore Army uniforms as they accepted the medal, which was placed around their neck by Obama. ""In the thick of the fight all those years ago, for your comrades and your country, you refused to yield,"" the President said. In 2002 Congress -- as part of the Defense Authorization Act -- set up a review of Jewish and Hispanic veterans who had served in combat since the middle of the century ""to ensure those deserving the Medal of Honor were not denied because of prejudice,"" explained the White House. The congressional action was later amended to open the door for any serviceman or woman denied the award due to discrimination. One of those who posthumously received the award is Leonard Kravitz, an assistant machine gunner in the Korean War. He is the uncle and namesake of actor and rock musician Lenny Kravitz. CNN's Barbara Starr and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: ''The only thing I could do is fight,"" honoree Melvin Morris tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- It could've paid for some wedding. With fiancée Caroline Wozniacki watching, golf star Rory McIlroy thought they were in for an unexpected early gift in Dubai on Saturday. Seeking the record $2.5 million on offer for a hole-in-one at the 325-yard par-four 17th hole, the former world No. 1 saw his drive roll agonizingly past the cup. ""I saw the pitch mark and it must have just run past the hole -- it could have paid for my wedding,"" joked the Northern Irishman, who proposed to his tennis star girlfriend in Sydney on New Year's Eve. ""It's a great shot to get it on that green and try to get it in the hole. I'll go for it again tomorrow and see what happens,"" he told reporters. But perhaps foremost in the 25-year-old's mind on Sunday will be winning his first European Tour title in 14 months as he seeks to regain the lead from defending Desert Classic champion Stephen Gallacher. The Scot carded a sizzling nine-under-par 63 in Saturday's third round to claim a two-shot advantage over McIlroy, who shot 69. The 39-year-old was 10 under for the last 10 holes as he fired eight birdies and an eagle in his bid to become the first player to retain the title on the tournament's 25th anniversary. ""That's a great stretch of holes and hopefully he doesn't continue it tomorrow!"" said 2009 winner McIlroy, who played with Gallacher in the opening two rounds -- also carding 63 on the opening day before a bout of food poisoning saw him struggle to 70 on Friday. McIlroy was denied victory in Abu Dhabi last month after a two-shot penalty incurred in the third round following an incident flagged up by a playing partner's caddy. His last victory on the European Tour came at the season-ending championship in Dubai in November 2012, when he clinched a money-list double by adding to his PGA Tour title. ""I got off to another shaky start,"" he said of Saturday's effort, in which he bogeyed the opening hole but rebounded with an eagle at the par-five third. ""The conditions were tricky out there, it was breezy. It was tough to get close to some of these pins."" Veteran Dane Thomas Bjorn, the 2001 champion, shot 65 to be tied for third with 23-year-old American Brooks Koepa, who signed for 70 -- both were four shots adrift of Gallacher. World No. 1 Tiger Woods, the winner in 2006 and 2008, was 11 strokes off the pace in a tie for 37th after four-birdie 70 which left the American on five-under 211. ""I wasted a lot of opportunities out there,"" Woods told reporters. ""I only hit a couple of bad shots, missed a ton of putts and just threw away a lot of shots."" Meanwhile, former Masters champion Bubba Watson shared the halfway lead at the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open. Watson followed his opening 64 with a 66, but was caught at the top as Matt Jones carded a second successive 65. British Open champion Phil Mickelson was eight shots off the pace after his 67 on Friday.","Rory McIlroy two shots off the lead at the Dubai Desert Classic after a 69 on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- In its bid to compete with major U.S. sports, American rugby could be set to receive a huge boost. USA Rugby has announced its interest in tendering for the right to host the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens, ahead of a formal bid on December 5. Sevens is a scaled-down version of rugby union, with seven players on each team rather than 15. Over 10 countries have so far registered an interest in hosting the tournament, with the International Rugby Board set to make a final decision on May 15, 2015. ""2018 may appear to be a long way away at this time, but the decision on who will host the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 2018 will be made in the next 13 months,"" USA Rugby chief executive officer Nigel Melville said in a statement. ""The USA Rugby board have already established a Rugby World Cup bid committee under the chairmanship of board member Will Chang and talks have already taken place with a small number of cities who have expressed interest in hosting this incredible event."" The U.S. team currently competes in the HSBC Sevens World Series, an annual global competition which takes place over eight months in nine different countries. The Las Vegas leg of the series took place in January. The Rugby World Cup Sevens, first staged in 1993, is held every four years. The 2013 tournament took place at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, with New Zealand winning both the men's and women's competitions. Sevens will make its Olympic debut at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro and to accommodate the International Olympic Committee calendar, the World Cup was put back from 2017 to 2018.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force is grounding all firefighting-equipped C-130 planes after the fatal crash of one in southwestern South Dakota, the military said Monday. Air Force spokesman Todd Spitler announced that C-130s with the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System, or MAFFS, won't fly until further notice. The South Dakota crash follows another crash of a non-military firefighing air tanker, along the Nevada-Utah border, several weeks earlier. The Air Force describes MAFFS as ""a self-contained aerial firefighting system owned by the U.S. Forest Service that can discharge 3,000 gallons of water or fire retardant in less than five seconds, covering an area one-quarter of a mile long by 100-feet wide."" Including the one went down, eight such military planes had been deployed since June 24 to fight wildfires in the Rocky Mountain region and thus are affected by the order, said National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones. This is out of hundreds of C-130s in operation around the world, and among dozens of helicopters, large air tankers and other aerial equipment that have and will continue to be used in battling fires. The grounded C-130 aircraft were unique in that they include ""sliding tanks that can be inserted into an aircraft without major structural modifications,"" Jones said. The Air Force decision to remove these aircraft from operation will force firefighting authorities to adjust, the spokeswoman said. That includes possibly altering strategy in combating the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado Springs, where C-130s were among the tools being used to corral what has been described as the worst wildfire in Colorado's history but is now 70% contained. ""(These crews) are highly trained and the best-equipped in the world,"" Jones said. ""They have a lot of strategies and tactics."" Besides the tactical impact, Sunday's crash in South Dakota is taking an emotional toll as well. Some North Carolina Air National Guard members died and others suffered serious injuries when their C-130 tanker crashed around 6:30 p.m. MT (8:30 p.m. ET), spokesman Lt. Col. Robert Carver said Monday. Their aircraft was operated by the state National Guard's 145th Airlift Wing and had been deployed to fight the so-called White Draw Fire burning near Edgemont at the time it went down. Evacuee: Wildfire aftermath is 'kind of like the twilight zone' ""There were lives lost, there were injuries. We're very grateful for the survivors, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families who have lost loved ones,"" Carver said, who did not specify how many people died in the crash. President Barack Obama issued a statement Sunday saluting those killed and injured in the crash, as well as others who are helping fight blazes around the country. ""The airmen who attack these fires from above repeatedly confront dangerous conditions in an effort to give firefighters on the ground a chance to contain these wildfires -- to save homes, businesses, schools, and entire communities,"" Obama said. ""They are heroes who deserve the appreciation of a grateful nation."" Those hurt are being treated in a hospital in Rapid City, South Dakota, according to Carver. ""You can't ask for people of higher character who go in harms way and volunteer to do so,"" he said. The cause of the crash is under investigation. The South Dakota wildfire has scorched 4,200 acres since it began Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The fire, which is fueled by dry brush and trees, was 30% contained Monday -- threatening structures and prompting an unspecified number of evacuations. That wildfire is one of many burning in western states, including Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and Arizona. 'Great day' as evacuations lifted, fight continues vs. Colorado fire . It was the second time within two months that an air tanker has crashed. An air tanker crashed in mountainous terrain in western Utah on June 3, killing two pilots, authorities said. That P2V air tanker was on its second run of the day fighting the White Rock Fire along the Nevada-Utah border. That fire, which began June 1, was 100% contained on June 9, fire officials said. There had been no crashes of firefighting-equipped C-130s until Sunday's in South Dakota, with the U.S. Northern Command calling it the first crash ""in the 40-year history of the MAFFS program."" Three state Air National Guards divisions -- California, Wyoming as well as North Carolina -- operate C-130s with firefighting capabilities, as does an Air Force Reserve unit out of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The technology the crews is are a ""valuable"" resource, though they are only deployed ""when everything else is exhausted,"" according to Carver. ""When they put fire retardant down on the leading edge of the fire, it's very effective in keeping the fire from advancing,"" the lieutenant colonel said. There's been no timetable given as to when the specially equipped C-130s might return to the skies. The remaining crews spent Monday getting together to ""reflect, reset and review,"" said 153rd Air Expeditionary Group commander Col. Jerry Champlin, according to a U.S. Northern Command press release. ""We all need to make sure our crews and planes will be ready to re-engage in the mission safely,"" said Champlin.

"(CNN) -- For those who didn't know much about Shirley Temple, her passing this week revealed two surprises. First, that her post-Hollywood career was dominated by public service. She ran (unsuccessfully) for Congress in 1967, served as a representative to the United Nations and was ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia. And second, she was a Republican. She was that rarest of things nowadays: a Hollywood star who admitted to voting for the GOP. Today, Hollywood appears uniformly liberal. But once upon a time, things were different. While researching my forthcoming book on Hollywood and politics, I was surprised to discover how many vocal conservatives there were in Hollywood well into the 1970s - and that many of them enjoyed the company of Richard Nixon. John Wayne narrated a Nixon biographical documentary at the 1972 GOP convention, where Clint Eastwood was a highly visible guest. Bob Hope toured the country with Jack Benny and country pop star Glenn Campbell to drum up support for the troops in Vietnam. Hope closed his 1970 Christmas TV special with a plea for viewers to get behind the President. James Stewart once told reporters, ""All you have to do is go to Vietnam to see that the kids are still patriotic,"" and suggested that antiwar Hollywood actors were just eaten up with bitterness at Nixon's popularity. Yet in 21st century America, the only public Hollywood support Republicans can get (look at Romney's pitiful donations) tends to come from faded action heroes like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris. Yes, Eastwood is still a fan of the GOP, as is Jon Voight, and Vince Vaughn is close to the Paul family. But the acting contingent of conservatism has shrunk. The reason is recent political dynamics. Hollywood has moved to the left; the Republicans have moved to the right. When Shirley Temple Black was a child star, Hollywood was dominated by powerful Republican moguls. The movies she tap danced and sang through for Fox might have earned the praise of Franklin D Roosevelt (he once said, ""It is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles""), but the industry that produced them was anti-union, anti-communist, and typically anti-Democrat. There was, for example, near unanimity between the otherwise inharmonious studio chiefs in opposing Upton Sinclair's 1934 ultra-liberal campaign for governor of California. (Sinclair wanted to introduce a graduated income tax.) The moguls actually made their staff donate a week's salary to Sinclair's Republican opponent. But the moguls lost their power when the studios were undone by trust-busting and TV. In the 1960s, a new generation of stars defined themselves artistically by their revolt against the studio machine and ""square"" middle-American culture. These were the beautiful people like Jane Fonda, Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine. They began as political outsiders, but their activism slowly professionalized and grew into PACs that raised millions of dollars for almost exclusively Democrat campaigns. Men like Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen became the new kingmakers. In one month of the 2012 election season, Spielberg and Katzenberg each gave $1 million to President Obama's super PAC Priorities USA. Hollywood money is an indispensable part of the modern Democrat machine. Of course, movie makers might consider themselves socially progressive, but, as their disposable income attests, they are still ambitious capitalists -- ones that might have remained more open to the Republican Party if it had only stuck to its old theme of limited, small tax government. But the GOP viscerally repelled the new Hollywood with its social conservatism. The actor Ronald Reagan's election as president ought to have represented the pinnacle of Hollywood conservatism, but, ironically, it actually represented the beginning of its post-Nixon decline. Reagan's willingness to reach out to the religious right meant that while he was certainly a product of the movie industry, he had effectively divorced himself from its libertine culture. Throughout his time in office, his Hollywood support base whittled down to the last surviving members of the Shirley Temple generation. When the Gipper threw a televised charity function in 1985, the guests were Frank Sinatra, Charlton Heston and Dean Martin. The only real contemporary 80s star was Burt Reynolds. In other words, as Hollywood moved left and the Republicans moved right, they passed each other on the political spectrum. One wonders whether Shirley Temple would have felt as comfortable identifying herself with the GOP today as she did in the 1960s and 1970s. My guess is yes. After all, her Republicanism persisted (she was still campaigning for George H.W. Bush in 1992) and, as a child rather than an adult star, she had nothing to lose in terms of Hollywood clout by going public with her conservatism. For all those moderate Republicans (and, yes, they really do exist) out there in Hollywood, things are a lot harder. If they come out as conservative, they risk never getting invited to any forthcoming benefits George Clooney might be throwing to liberate the Elgin Marbles. That's a serious problem, because Hollywood is a business in which who you know is as important as what you know. Therefore, if stars admit their Republicanism, they risk losing friends, parts and a steady income. No wonder so few do it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: Shirley Temple was American's sweetheart and a committed conservative .
Conservatism in Hollywood today is a rarity today .
Reagan, as president, wooed religious right; Hollywood conservatism declined, he says .
He says studios' political kingmakers now come from the left ."
"(CNN) -- The family of long-missing former FBI agent Robert Levinson has renewed its request for a meeting with the bureau's new director following reports Levinson had been working for the CIA when he vanished, the family's lawyer said Monday. Levinson disappeared on a trip to Iran in 2007, and U.S. officials say they have no idea where he is now. The Associated Press and The Washington Post reported last week that he had been working as a contractor for the CIA, but the White House said Levinson ""was not a U.S. government employee"" when he disappeared. Family attorney David McGee said Levinson's relatives were supposed to meet with FBI Director James Comey about the case long before it became publicly known that Levinson was working for the CIA. The FBI has delayed previously scheduled meetings since Comey took over as director in September, McGee says. A U.S. law enforcement official said the FBI is working to set up that meeting with Comey, who has been traveling extensively, and the bureau hopes to arrange that meeting soon. Missing American Robert Levinson not 'abandoned' in Iran, John Kerry says . Levinson, now 65, had gone to Iran on a mission to investigate corruption involving the laundering of oil profits by Iranian officials, including former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, according to a source. Iran has consistently denied having any knowledge of Levinson's whereabouts, and there has been no sign of him since a 2010 video. At the time of his disappearance, the State Department said he was on a private business trip investigating cigarette smuggling and said he was not working for the government. His family had also said he wasn't working for the government. Levinson was on the CIA books as an ""analyst,"" to write academic papers, with money laundering a particular area of expertise, McGee said. But in reality, Levinson was an operative traveling overseas, recruiting, and interviewing sources. McGee said records he found show ""without a shadow of a doubt"" that Levinson was a CIA contract employee on a rogue assignment in Iran for the agency when he disappeared. After Levinson disappeared, McGee said he called people at the CIA to tell them they had a man missing. Nothing happened, McGee said. When the Levinson family first went to the Senate Intelligence Committee for help, staffers contacted the CIA and at that point, the CIA told them ""they have no connection with him at all,"" McGee said. White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip . The family then found documentation and returned to the Intelligence Committee, giving staffers what they call ""smoking gun"" evidence. The documents included Levinson's contract and expense reports that detailed his previous assignments, including a detailed 2006 report of his work on a separate mission regarding Iran's nuclear program. That mission did not take him to Iran. The family also had e-mails regarding his pending 2007 trip to Iran involving his instructions with Dawud Salahuddin, an American fugitive who lives in Iran. Salahuddin has said he met with Levinson in a hotel on Kish Island on March 8, 2007. The meeting was an effort to put Levinson in touch with Iranian authorities to help the American investigate cigarette smuggling as a contractor for a tobacco company. In classified Intelligence Committee meetings that followed, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson gave then-CIA Director Michael Hayden a ""grilling,"" McGee said. Confronted with the evidence, the CIA then demurred, said it would get back in touch and later admitted the relationship with Levinson, he said. In the meantime, the CIA paid the family $120,000 for Levinson's trip and eventually settled for $2.5 million to avoid a lawsuit, according to McGee. Ultimately, seven CIA staffers were disciplined and three were fired, McGee said -- including Levinson's chief handler. Reports: American who went missing in Iran worked for CIA . CNN Justice Reporter Evan Perez contributed to this report.","Former FBI agent Robert Levinson has been missing since 2007 .

"New York (CNN) -- A 35-year-old woman on a first date plummeted to her death early Thursday morning when she fell from the balcony of her 17th floor New York City apartment. Jennifer Rosoff went outside on her balcony around 12:50 a.m. Thursday to talk and smoke a cigarette with her date when the balcony's railing broke, according to police. It's unclear whether Rosoff leaned on the balcony, causing it to give way. She landed on a second-story construction scaffolding of the building and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Rosoff's employer, online advertising startup TripleLift, released a statement expressing sorrow at the news of her death. ""We are all deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of our dear friend and co-worker,"" the statement said. ""Her tremendous energy and humor brought so much joy to the office.""

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department is set to make it easier for more federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses to get clemency applications into the bureaucratic pipeline. Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that expanded criteria will soon be put in place, and anticipates a sharp increase in the number of eligible petitioners. Inmates seeking a reduced or suspended sentence must first ask the department for relief, and those applications are then reviewed by the president. The pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort to remedy the once-common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine, based on guidelines first enacted by Congress more than 25 years ago. The issue has been a major policy priority for Holder and President Barack Obama. In addition to the clemency angle, the administration has been pushing to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases, and recommending rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners. ""The White House has indicated it wants to consider additional clemency applications to restore a degree of justice, fairness and proportionality for deserving individuals who do not pose a threat to public safety,"" said Holder in a videotaped message posted on the department's website. ""The Justice Department is committed to recommending as many qualified applicants as possible for reduced sentences."" Holder: I back a plan to reduce some drug-related sentences . The department later this week promised more specifics on the new criteria, including how it will handle an expected flood of clemency requests. Obama three years ago signed the Fair Sentencing Act to address the larger issue. And last December, he commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates convicted of crack cocaine crimes, concluding those offenses that did not justify such lengthy prison terms. The issue has racial overtones, since U.S. Sentencing Commission figures in 2006 showed African-Americans made up nearly 82 percent of defendants sentenced in federal court for dealing crack, but only 27 percent of those sentenced for dealing powder cocaine. In 2011, federal courts dealt with more than 10,000 cocaine sentences a year, roughly evenly divided between crack and cases involving the powdered substance. Until the changes started nearly a decade ago, the sentencing guidelines provided for a 100-to-1 ratio between the penalties for crack cocaine offenses versus those for powdered cocaine. Dealing 5 grams of crack meant some defendants could get as much prison time as someone who dealt 500 grams of powder. The 100-to-1 factor had long been a source of contention between government prosecutors and civil rights advocates, who argued crack dealers were targeted for longer prison terms because that drug is prevalent in urban and minority communities, while the powdered version is more commonly associated with higher-income users. Actions taken by the President, lawmakers, and the Sentencing Commission -- an independent federal agency that advises all three branches of government on sentences -- served to cut the gap in recommended prison time for offenses involving the two varieties of cocaine. In the private sector, Families Against Mandatory Minimums has fought for changes in mandatory cocaine penalties for years. The fair sentencing law changed the 100-to-1 disparity between minimum sentences for crack and powder cocaine to 18 to 1. The Sentencing Commission subsequently voted to make the reduced crack penalties retroactive, which meant more than 12,000 current inmates are eligible to request reduced sentences. Previous presidential administrations had argued that Congress made a special point of creating the 100-to-1 ratio to send a tough message to crack dealers. The harsher sentences came after a social epidemic of crack cocaine began destroying many urban areas in the 1980s. Congress then established guidelines to ensure relatively consistent sentences for federal criminal defendants. But the Supreme Court in 2005 concluded that while the guidelines are constitutional, they should nevertheless be considered ""advisory,"" not mandatory. Judges could consult them as needed when imposing sentences and their decisions would be given deference on appeal, so long as they were not ""unreasonable."" Congressional lawmakers -- Republicans and Democrats -- then went back in 2006 with various bills that eventually reduced the disparity in cocaine sentences. Nevertheless, said Holder, ""There are still too many people in federal prison who were sentenced under the old regime -- and who, as a result, will have to spend far more time in prison than they would if sentenced today for exactly the same crime. This is simply not right."" CNN's Justice Reporter Evan Perez contributed to this report.","The Justice Department will make it easier for certain prisoners to get clemency petitions .

"(Mental Floss) -- With Mother's Day just around the corner, this week seemed like a great time to give a tip of our caps to stay-at-home moms, including these four who used clever ideas to become business moguls. Gerber: Of course only a mother could found such a successful baby food company! In the late 1920s, Michigan mom Dorothy S. Gerber was hand-straining food for her baby daughter, Sally, when she realized there must be some way to avoid the messy task. She pointed out to her husband, Daniel, that if his family's business, the Fremont Canning Company, could puree a tomato all day long, its equipment could probably make short work of other fruits and veggies, too. Daniel Gerber realized his wife was on to something, and after a year of experimentation -- and an extensive search to find the right drawing for their label's now-iconic ""Gerber baby"" - the Gerbers introduced their first line of baby foods, a super-yummy menu of strained peas, carrots, prunes, and spinach. Mental Floss: 6 unforgettable movie mothers . Baby Einstein: When Alpharetta, Georgia mom Julie Aigner-Clark went looking for educational materials for her newborn daughter in 1996, she found a disappointing hole in the baby market: there weren't really any educational materials to expose babies to music and the arts. Some parents would just accept whatever the market was offering. Not Aigner-Clark. She shot a video for her daughter in her basement then edited it with her husband, Bill, on the family computer. She even doodled a logo for the video at her kitchen table. Within a year, the first Baby Einstein video was in stores, and the series quickly became a runaway hit. Disney bought the company in 2001 after Baby Einstein raked in $12 million in revenue the previous year. After the sale Aigner-Clark gave an interview to The New York Times in which she sounded a little surprised by her huge windfall. ""I was just a stay-at-home mom who wanted to expose my daughter to classical music, poetry, not a budding entrepreneur."" Mental Floss: 6 other animals dogs will adopt . Mrs. Fields: Debbi Fields was a young stay-at-home mom when she started to feel restless in 1977. She had always loved baking cookies, so she figured she might try her hand at opening a cookie store. The concept doesn't sound odd now that there's seemingly a Mrs. Fields outlet in every mall you walk into, but at the time the notion that a store would only sell cookies seemed absurd. Furthermore, Fields was only 20 years old and didn't have any business experience. Fields nevertheless managed to secure financing for her venture and she opened up her first cookie shop in Palo Alto, California. Fields and her husband, Randall, soon confirmed their suspicions that people really enjoy cookies and will gladly drop a few bucks to get a warm one. The company began a sweeping franchising program, and in the 1993 Fields sold her cookie empire to an investment firm. Mental Floss: People who switched careers after 50 (and thrived) BabyLegs: Put this one on the list of brilliant niche markets we didn't know existed: baby legwarmers. Nicole Donnelly managed to turn that very idea into a fabulously successful company. In April 2005 Donnelly found a new weapon in her ongoing battle with her daughter's diaper rashes. By letting her daughter enjoy some of what they called ""nakedy butt time,"" the rash got some much-needed fresh air, but the tot's legs got cold. Donnelly combatted this chilliness by cutting up a pair of socks to make improvised baby legwarmers. Donnelly quickly realized that the legwarmers had all sorts of side benefits. They did more than just keep her daughter's legs toasty; they also protected the baby's legs when she crawled and made changing diapers a breeze. Donnelly whipped up some stylish designs and began selling BabyLegs to other moms. BabyLegs proved to be an incredibly lucrative idea. In 2008 the company moved over $4 million worth of its legwarmers worldwide, and in April 2009 United Legwear bought a majority stake in the company and began aggressively expanding the company's reach.

"(CNN) -- Stanislas Wawrinka has had little time to rest on his laurels after winning his first grand slam title but the new Australian Open champion rounded off a superb day for Switzerland as they took a commanding 2-0 lead over Serbia in a Davis Cup tie in Novi Sad Friday. Wawrinka battled jet leg after the long haul flight from Melbourne -- where he had beaten Rafael Nadal in Sunday's final -- to see off Dusan Lajovic 6-4 4-6 6-1 7-6. Earlier, former world number one Roger Federer, a late inclusion in a strong Swiss line-up, beat Ilija Bozoljac 6-4 7-5 6-2 to give them the advantage. Serbia, beaten in last year's final by the Czech Republic, is fielding a much-weakened team with both world number two Novak Djokovic and Janko Tipsarevic sitting out the World Group match. Federer came back from 5-2 down in the second set to snuff out any hopes Bozoljac might case an upset and he raced through the third set . ""In the second set I was just glad to take advantage and fight back. The most important thing is that I won the match in straight sets,"" Federer told the official Davis Cup website. Wawrinka took the first set against world number 102 Lajovic, but was in trouble in the second as the Serbian leveled. The new Swiss number one raced through the third set, but the fourth was again a struggle and he needed unforced errors from the inexperienced Lajovic in the tiebreak to close out the match. ""It was a tough match and it wasn't easy for me to come here after the last few weeks,"" Wawrinka said. ""I didn't really have enough time to get ready as I was exhausted both mentally and physically, but I was determined to fight and win the match and I was really happy to get through it."" Nadal, troubled by a back injury during his four-set loss to Wawrinka, is missing Spain's tie against Germany and in his absence they have fallen 2-0 behind in Frankfurt. Philipp Kohlschreiber was in superb form as he thrashed Spain's new boy Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 6-4 6-2 while Florian Mayer came out on top in a marathon battle against Feliciano Lopez to win 7-6 7-6 1-6 5-7 6-3 in just under four hours. Boris Becker, now in Djokovic's coaching team, was delighted to see his country performing so well against the five-time champions. ""And we have 2points against #spain in #frankfurt #DavisCup !!!!"" he tweeted.

On the WTA Tour, top seed Maria Sharapova reached the semifinals of the Paris Indoor Open with a 6-2 6-2 win over Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium, who had beaten titleholder Mona Barthel of Germany in the first round. Sharapova will face fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the final as she continues her comeback from an injury which wrecked the second half of her 2013 season.

"(CNN) -- Although Chris Brown faces just a misdemeanor charge, the singer has a lot riding on Monday's assault trial in Washington. He could receive probation in the District of Columbia if found guilty, but a Los Angeles judge is waiting on the verdict before deciding whether Brown, 24, will remain jailed in California. An acquittal would give Brown's lawyer a chance to argue that he should be allowed to make his own way back to California for a probation hearing. Otherwise, he'll have to go back the way he came to Washington -- on ""Con Air,"" the federal inmate transport system. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial . The singer's trial is set to start immediately after D.C. Superior Judge Patricia Wynn announces her verdict in last week's trial of Brown's bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, on the same charge. Wynn will also decide Brown's case. Hollosy's case was tried first so that he could freely testify in his boss's defense about the sidewalk fight that landed them both in jail last October. He's expected to say that he landed the punch that broke Parker Adams' nose and that he did it because it was his job to protect Brown. Hollosy's lawyer Bernard Grimm argued in the bodyguard's trial that Adams, 20, was ""simply trying to get rich"" by accusing Brown and Hollosy of assaulting him. Howard University student Jalen Garrison testified in the Hollosy trial that she and a friend were posing for photos on the sidewalk with Brown when Adams, who is her boyfriend, tried to snap his own photo with Brown. Brown got upset, telling Adams, ""I don't like that gay s***,"" Garrison testified. Brown lunged at Adams, hitting him the face, she testified. A limousine driver testified that he witnessed Brown and Hollosy hit Adams. The bodyguard pulled Brown away before throwing his own punch, he said. Adams did not hit back, he said. Adams, when asked to rate the power of Brown's punch on a scale of one to 10, scored it a six. Hollosy, he testified, packed a 10. Adams, who said he earns about $200 a day working at a restaurant, acknowledged that he's suing Brown, potentially seeking millions of dollars for the assault. The lawsuit was filed ""because family knew a lawyer in church and that justice should be served,"" he testified. Brown's mother and aunts, who live in Virginia, along with his girlfriend Karrueche Tran and rapper Bow Wow were in court Friday expecting Brown's trial to start. Wynn delayed it, however, saying she needed more time than expected to decide Hollosy's case. Brown's legal troubles began five years ago when he beat Rihanna as the two were in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community ""labor-oriented service."" Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. Brown proceeded ""to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His probation was revoked in November, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program. Although he completed that program last month, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu, California, treatment facility until another hearing April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a February hearing that the singer ""continues to make great improvement"" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for an assault charge in Washington on April 17. If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide at an April 23 hearing whether Brown should complete his probation in jail. He was sent to jail on March 14 after he was kicked out of the second rehab program for rules violations. The judge said he was concerned about a ""provocative"" statement counselors said Brown wrote on a card at the Malibu rehab center. ""I am good at using guns and knives,"" according to a document read in court. The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said. Brown refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient, according to the document. Brown had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. With his community labor work now on hold, his probation is expected to extend into 2015.","The D.C. verdict will impact Chris Brown's jail time in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- A grueling qualification campaign is over, and for 32 footballing nations the dreaming can begin. On Friday those lucky enough to have qualified for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil will learn who they are to meet in the group stage at one of the biggest sporting showpieces on the planet. The fixtures will be finalized -- this year by a more complicated process than previous events -- the participants will discover where their matches are to be played and they can start plotting a route to the final in Rio de Janeiro. For the host nation, too, this is a chance to generate some positive news after months of headlines detailing delays in construction and public protests at spiraling costs. The most recent, and tragic, tale to emerge concerned the death of two construction workers after a crane collapsed at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo -- due to host the World Cup's opening match. Friday marks the start of a countdown to June 12 next year, when Brazil will begin a month-long festival of football, likely to captivate the world. Where? The draw will take place in the resort of Costa do Sauipe in Bahia on the northeast coast of Brazil. In attendance will be representatives from each World Cup nation as well as FIFA's top brass, including president Sepp Blatter. The ceremony will be broadcast live to 193 countries from 1 p.m. local time (1700 CET) with 1,300 guests alongside a bank of 2,000 reporters. As ever, there will be entertainment, including turns from Brazilian singers Alexandre Pires and Vanessa da Mata as well as dance troupe Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker. There has been some controversy already when the two actors scheduled to host the draw -- Lazaro Ramos and Camila Pitanga, who both have dark skin -- were replaced by another married celebrity couple, Fernanda Lima and Rodrigo Hilbert, who are blond and white. What is it? The World Cup draw determines which of the 32 nations will face each other in the group stages. Teams will be drawn into eight groups of four, based on FIFA's seeding system and geographical separation, meaning that teams from the same qualification zone can't be drawn in the same group. There is an exception for European countries, given there are 13 participating in the tournament, but no more than two from the region can be drawn in the same group. The winners of a particular group will face the runner-up of another when the tournament enters its final-16 stage -- the first of the knockout rounds. The seedings . Eight teams in the draw are seeded -- seven are the highest placed teams from FIFA's rankings, the other is host Brazil. The top seven when the seedings were announced in October comprised of defending champion Spain along with Germany, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, Uruguay and Switzerland. The seedings are calculated on how a team has played over the past four years, with the most recent year given greatest importance. Teams earn ranking points for a win or a draw but nothing for a defeat. The points vary with each game depending on who is playing and whether it is a friendly or qualifying match. Uneven numbers . When there are eight unseeded European teams -- as in 2010 -- the draw works easily and smoothly, meaning FIFA can organize the nations into four pots of eight teams. But because there are nine unseeded European teams in the 2014 World Cup, things become a little more complicated. FIFA has decided to put these nine teams into one pot, and prior to the draw they will pull out one nation to go into pot two with five African nations and the two unseeded South American sides. That country will be selected at random, despite France -- which qualified through the playoffs -- being the lowest ranked nation from the European qualifying phase. This random element has not gone down well with some of the other countries in that part of the draw. Pot X . As a starting point, Brazil will automatically be drawn into Group A due to its role as host. Then the other seeded teams will be allocated their groups, which runs as far as Group H. And then it gets rather complicated. With one of the unseeded European teams now residing in pot two, there are now nations from three geographical zones in the same pot. That increases the chances of three European teams ending up in the same group, a violation of FIFA's ""geographical separation"" principle. As such, the governing body decided to create ""Pot X"" into which four of the seeded South American teams will be placed. One is drawn out and then paired together in a group with the unseeded European team from pot two. After that, the rest of the teams will be allocated to their groups -- with the only other issue residing with Chile and Ecuador, who can skip a group in order to avoid being drawn with seeded South American teams. Group of Death . As ever with any high-profile soccer draw there is the potential for the much-touted ""Group of Death."" Whichever unseeded European team is plucked out of pot four and put into pot two might be forgiven for watching the rest of the draw from behind their sofa. That nation will be guaranteed to face one of the South American seeds from Pot X -- Brazil, Argentina, Colombia or Uruguay. Then they could face the United States from pot three and either Italy or Netherlands from pot four, making qualification for the last 16 much harder.","The draw for the World Cup finals takes place in Bahia, Brazil on Friday .

"(CNN) -- At least five people -- three in North Carolina, one in Indiana and one in Ohio -- were injured after weapons went off at gun shows Saturday, officials said, at a time when there's been renewed discussion about private gun sales at such shows. The most casualties came at the Dixie Gun and Knife Show in Raleigh, North Carolina, where attendees bolted -- with at least one woman wiping out in the frenetic scene -- when gunfire rang out around 1 p.m., as seen on video captured by CNN affiliate WRAL. Police later explained that a a 36-year-old man from Wilmington, North Carolina, was unfastening the case of his 12-gauge shotgun on a table near the show entrance when it accidentally discharged. The man planned to sell the shotgun at the show. The bird shot ended up injuring three people. One was a sheriff's deputy, who suffered a slight injury to his hand and was treated and released at a local hospital before returning immediately to work, said Joel Keith, chief of police of the North Carolina State Fair. A 54-year-old woman from Benson, North Carolina, was being treated for a wound to her right torso at a local hospital, and a 50-year-old man from Durham, North Carolina, was treated for an injured left hand, Keith told reporters. ""I want to emphasize that this is an accident,"" Keith said. That said, Wake County sheriff's investigators and the local prosecutor will determine whether to file charges against the gun's owner, authorities said. Read more: Surprise! Mom packed you a nice gun . Sheriff Donnie Harrison said he was unsure whether it was legal to bring a loaded gun on state fairgrounds. However, when the state fair is held in October, it is illegal to bring a loaded gun to the fairground because of the large crowds, authorities said. ""This is state property. That's something we're looking into,"" Harrison told reporters. ""It's early right now."" The shooting prompted police to ban any private gun sales -- in which visitors bring their firearms to sell at the gun show -- for the remainder of the two-day show, which concludes Sunday, Keith said. He added there wouldn't be any private gun sales on fairgrounds for the indefinite future. The gun show was closed after the shooting and will reopen Sunday. At that point, show vendors can continue to sell firearms, which are already secured inside the show, Keith said. ""If we thought if it was a problem or a hazard, we wouldn't have this show,"" Keith said about private gun sales at the show. ""I'm sure there isn't anybody who hates this more than the guy who owned this weapon."" Man shoots business partner with semi-automatic handgun . A person is in stable condition at a northern Ohio hospital after being shot by his business partner at a gun show run by Conrad and Dowdell Productions, said Medina police Chief Patrick Berarducci. The original owner of the Taurus semi-automatic 9 mm handgun used in the shooting brought the firearm into the show fully loaded. This is despite the policy of searches to make sure all guns are not loaded and rendered safe before others can handle them. The man who bought the gun told police that he took it out, then accidentally fired it, said Berarducci. A single bullet ended up going into the arm and thigh of this man's business partner. Authorities don't know who brought the loaded firearm into the gun show and sold it, added the police chief. They'll file a request with the federal ATF to track this person down. The victim, meanwhile, is in good spirits with non-life-threatening injuries, according to Berarducci. And in Indianapolis, a man walking out of the Indy 1500 Gun and Knife Show shot himself in the hand as he was loading his .45-caliber semi-automatic firearm, Indiana State Police said in a statement. The 54-year-old Indianapolis man was sent to Wishard Hospital for treatment after being ""slightly"" injured. ""The investigation determined the shooting to be accidental, and no charges will be filed,"" police said. Read more: Newspaper removes controversial online database of gun permit holders . Shootings occur as gun debate rages . Reforming private gun sales -- at shows or anywhere else -- is among the changes that President Barack Obama is now seeking by requiring background checks. The president has called for action in the wake of last month's shooting at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 27 people -- 20 of them children age 7 or younger -- dead. Gun control activists have likewise pushed for changes, while gun rights advocates have said restrictions on gun sales are unnecessary and in defiance of their Second Amendment rights. Currently, federal law requires background checks on gun sales by federally licensed firearms dealers, who are often among the vendors at gun shows. Saturday's incidents occurred on 'Gun Appreciation Day,"" an event led by a gun rights group that urged Americans to ""go to your local gun store, gun range or gun show with your Constitution, American flags and your 'Hands off my Guns' sign to send a loud and clear message."" Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, last Sunday issued a statement predicting this event would drive up sales of things like ""assault-style rifles,"" which have already ""skyrocketed"" in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting. Jabari Richards, a gun enthusiast, told WRAL at the Raleigh, North Carolina, show that he thought some reforms were wise. ""I think there should be background checks for everybody,"" Richards said, ""because then you know they ... are capable of having a gun."" But another man at the Raleigh show said it was useless for Washington to step in. ""The gun laws that they have on the books aren't enforced, don't do any good,"" Al Galbraith said.

"(CNN) -- In a message to the Iranian people, an upbeat President Barack Obama said Thursday that the long isolated Middle East nation can soon improve its economy, its world standing and its people's lives if there's a breakthrough nuclear deal. ""For the first time in many years, we have the opportunity to start down a new path,"" Obama said in a message timed for Nowruz, the Persian new year. A lot has changed since the last Nowruz. For one, Iranians elected Hassan Rouhani -- who campaigned, in part, on opening up Iran more to the world including negotiations on its nuclear program -- as president last summer. Significant changes in Tehran's approach followed, leading to an interim agreement in November involving Iran and the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. The deal called for Iran to roll back parts of its nuclear program in return for relief from some sanctions. That agreement went into effect in January. The challenge now is to reach a permanent deal acceptable to all sides. Obama said Thursday that ""a comprehensive agreement ... this year can help open up new possibilities and prosperity for the Iranian people for years to come.""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Red banners flapped in the breeze of a packed Istanbul street Wednesday, where demonstrators gathered to listen to opposition members lambast Turkey's Prime Minister for a second day. Embarrassing audio recordings that sound like Recep Tayyip Erdogan giving his son money laundering tips over the phone have become a social media rage that poured out into the streets this week. The crowd chanted ""corruption everywhere, bribery everywhere"" and held up signs mocking the alleged phone conversations between Erdogan and his son Bilal. ""Daddy, is that you?"" one read. A day earlier, Erdogan made a full-throated denial. He did not say that the voice heard was not his, but that the recording was ""immoral edited material."" ""They are listening to the government's encrypted phones; that's how low they have sunk,"" Erdogan said. He denounced the recordings not as an attack on his person, but on the Turkish Republic, and he fingered interest groups that he has long accused of plotting to overthrow his government. Two people were dismissed and five were suspended in the past two days from a key government advisory group because of the scandal, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported. The Minister of Science, Industry and Technology, Fikri Isik, said the former head of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey's Information Technology department and the head of a leading technology center were dismissed. Five people responsible for encrypted phones for the research council were suspended. Opposition exploits . The recordings were just what his opposition was looking for in a corruption scandal that bogged down the country for months. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, played the recordings at a speech before an assembly of CHP lawmakers. ""Either you take a helicopter and flee abroad, or you resign,"" Kilicdaroglu said in a jab at Erdogan. Most mainstream Turkish television channels interrupted their live broadcast of Kilicdaroglu's speech when he began playing audio of the alleged conversation between Erdogan and his son. They then resumed the broadcast after the audio recordings stopped playing. The recordings appear to be wiretaps of a series of conversations allegedly between Erdogan and Bilal. They were allegedly made the day after a wide-reaching corruption investigation ensnared the sons of three Cabinet members. Bilal was questioned, but never detained in the investigation. Recordings common . Embarrassing recordings of private phone conversations have been emerging on the Internet on an almost weekly basis in Turkey, ever since police detained the Cabinet minsters' sons and dozens of other businessmen and officials closely linked to Erdogan's government on December 17. The government denounced the investigations, saying they were part of a coup attempt by what Erdogan officials described as a ""parallel state"" established within the police force and the judiciary. Thousands of police officers were removed from their posts after the corruption investigation, which caught Erdogan's administration by surprise. The top prosecutors who led the investigation have also been stripped of their positions. Meanwhile, the government has passed a highly controversial law that gives it direct control over the judiciary. Is instability the 'new normal' for Turkey?

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old Detroit woman who was shot and killed on the front porch of a Michigan home had a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit for drivers in the state, according to a toxicology report released Thursday. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, meanwhile, was scheduled to make an announcement Friday about a review of possible charges against the homeowner who fired the fatal shotgun blast. The report from the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office said Renisha McBride's alcohol level was 0.218%. The legal limit for drivers in Michigan is 0.08%. The report said McBride also had marijuana in her system when she was shot in the face by a homeowner after approaching his house after a car accident. Police have said that the unidentified homeowner's shotgun accidentally discharged. Lawyers for McBride's family claim she was simply looking for help after the accident, while those representing the homeowner said the 54-year-old man's actions were justified. Gerald Thurswell, an attorney representing McBride's family, said the autopsy findings were irrelevant. ""I don't think the fact that she was intoxicated changes anything,"" he said. ""Her being intoxicated on the toxicology report would make her less of a threat than more of a threat. The bottom line is, he should've called 911 when he heard a disturbance, and we know for a fact that the police would've been there in two minutes. Instead, he did the reverse. He took his shotgun, went on the porch, and blew her head off and then called 911."" Mark Carpenter, a lawyer for the homeowner, said he would not comment on the toxicology report until after the prosecutor's announcement Friday. An autopsy report said McBride was not shot at close range. As reported in The Detroit News this week, McBride's autopsy left many questions unanswered. The autopsy confirmed that McBride had been shot in the face but revealed little about how the early morning incident unfolded on November 2. ""There was an entrance shotgun wound to the face, with no evidence of close range discharge of a firearm noted on the skin surrounding this wound,"" said the autopsy report, which ruled her death a homicide. Detroit woman's autopsy leaves questions . McBride was in a car accident earlier that morning, but police said hours passed between the time of the wreck and her death. A woman told police that she helped McBride after the car crash, but that McBride said she wanted to go home and walked away from the scene, the Detroit News reported. The wreck happened about 1:30 a.m.; the shooting at 3:40 a.m. The homeowner said that he was awakened before dawn and believed someone was trying to break into his home.

"(CNN) -- A prominent Sri Lankan rights activist controversially detained by his government under anti-terror laws says he believes his arrest was partly spurred by an international push to independently investigate the country's human rights record following decades of civil war. Ruki Fernando, one of his country's leading human rights activists, was arrested late Sunday night with fellow activist Rev. Praveen Mahesan, a Roman Catholic priest, in the former Tamil rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi in the country's north. The men were taken to the Colombo headquarters of Sri Lanka's Terrorist Investigation Division, held for more than 48 hours and questioned, without access to lawyers, before being released early Monday. ""I think it's a deliberate attempt to intimidate and suppress any form of dissent, criticism or challenge, and clearly not allow people outside Sri Lanka to know what's happening inside the country,"" Fernando told CNN after his release. ""I anticipate that I will be subject to greater scrutiny and I am extremely worried about the safety and wellbeing of my colleagues and people I've spoken to in the past."" The arrests drew a wave of condemnation from NGOs and foreign governments, with British Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire saying they were ""not acceptable"" and the U.S. Embassy expressing concern. Fred Carver of the UK-based Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice said the invocation of anti-terror laws was ""outrageous"" and ""patently absurd."" ""They're peace activists,"" he said. Proposed resolution . The arrests occurred in the build-up to a crucial session of the United Nations Human Rights Council this month, at which a resolution sponsored by the United States, Britain and other countries is expected to be tabled. The proposed resolution could call for an independent international investigation into war crimes committed by government forces and Tamil separatists during Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war, which ended in 2009, as well as more recent alleged government abuses in the five years since its end. The council has passed two previous resolutions urging Sri Lanka to investigate war crimes, but its perceived failure to do so has led some nations to call for an independent investigation. Sri Lankan police spokesman Ajith Rohana said Fernando faced three charges: selling information abroad, attempting to damage the national harmony between communities, and aiding and abetting the rebuilding of the Tamil Tigers -- the brutal militant group involved in fighting for a Tamil homeland in the north of the country during the decades-long civil war. The investigation had found insufficient evidence to proceed with the charges. Fernando said the first two charges, which appeared to relate to his work with foreign media to highlight rights abuses, suggested that their arrest was motivated in strong part by the impending events in Geneva. ""I think what happened to us is very much linked to the resolution discussion,"" he said. ""I was repeatedly asked who in Geneva, who outside Sri Lanka, was I sharing information with? It seemed very clear they took great care for other nations not to hear any alternative information or perspectives from within Sri Lanka."" 'Attempt to intimidate' Carver said that, beyond the Sri Lankan government's ""thumbing its nose at Geneva,"" the arrests amounted to an attempt to intimidate those working to expose human rights abuses in post-war Sri Lanka. ""I think this is about sending a warning to human rights defenders that just because Geneva is going their way they haven't won, and more importantly showing them that they cannot interface with U.N. processes without suffering consequences. So if an investigation is established, they better not testify."" But Rohana denied that there was any attempt to intimidate or punish those involved in activism around the U.N. resolution. He said the activists had been arrested after visiting a place of interest relating to the shooting of a policeman in the Kilinochchi area last week. Fernando, a Catholic from the country's Sinhalese majority, denies any connection to the shooting or those responsible. He said he and Mahesan, a Tamil, had gone to investigate the facts surrounding the arrest of another activist in relation to the shooting, in the regular course of their human rights work. The activist, Jeyakumari Balendran, became a prominent campaigner against political disappearances after her teen son, who had been conscripted to fight for the Tigers, went missing after reportedly surrendering at the end of the war. She was arrested Friday on suspicion of harboring K.P. Selvanayagam, a Tamil Tiger-affiliated figure also known as ""Gobi,"" after he shot and wounded a policeman as authorities closed in on her house, according to a Sri Lankan government memo to the U.N. Fernando denied any connection to Selvanayagam. Mixed fortunes . The end of Sri Lanka's civil war has been a boon to its economy, paving the way for infrastructure reconstruction and the return of tourists, and bolstering President Mahinda Rajapaksa's popularity. But activists are calling on the international community to pay attention to conditions in Tamil-majority areas in the north and east of the country. A large military presence is at the heart of complaints of ongoing land expropriation, disappearances, sexual violations, arbitrary arrests and limitations on the freedom of movement, according to rights groups. Meanwhile an ongoing ""Sinhalization"" process -- in which the Buddhist culture and places of worship of the Sinhalese community were replacing the Hindu landscape of Tamil areas -- was a serious concern, as was growing hostility towards Christian and Muslim minorities, according to a joint memorandum submitted by civil society groups to the U.N. earlier this month. In a report in February, the Office of the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Human Rights acknowledged Sri Lanka's progress made in implementing some of the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, its national mechanism for post-war reconciliation. But it noted the government had failed to ensure independent and credible investigations into past violations, and noted ongoing attacks on religious minorities and intimidation of human rights activists, lawyers and journalists.","Two Sri Lankan human rights activists held under anti-terror laws have been released .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County coroner has ruled that Michael Jackson's death was a homicide involving a combination of drugs. Michael Jackson was found dead on June 25. He had been preparing for a comeback concert series in London. ""The drugs propofol and lorazepam were found to be the primary drugs responsible for Mr. Jackson's death,"" said a news release issued Friday by the coroner. ""Other drugs detected were: midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine and ephedrine."" The release said Jackson died from ""acute propofol intoxication,"" but said ""other conditions contributing to death: benzodiazepine effect."" Lorazepam, midazolam and diazepam are benzodiazepines. A lawyer for Jackson's personal physician criticized the coroner for releasing only a brief summary of his findings, saying it contained ""nothing new"" and had ""all the earmarks of police gamesmanship."" Michael Jackson's family issued a statement in reaction: ""The Jackson family again wishes to commend the actions of the Coroner, the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies, and looks forward to the day that justice can be served."" Federal and state agencies also have launched independent investigations into ""matters uncovered"" by Los Angeles police while looking into Jackson's death, authorities said.  Watch a report on the coroner's findings » . The Los Angeles Police Department, which has been conducting a criminal investigation of Jackson's death, requested at an interagency meeting last week that federal and state agencies pursue their own investigations, according to statements issued Friday by California's attorney general and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The full and final autopsy report and the complete toxicology report ""will remain on security hold at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County district attorney,"" the release said.  See a timeline of events in the case » . Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician, told investigators that he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs -- lorazepam, midazolam and diazepam -- in an effort to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing, according to a police affidavit made public earlier this week. Murray also told detectives he administered a dosage of the anesthetic propofol, diluted with lidocaine, to Jackson a short time before he stopped breathing, the affidavit said. The 32-page sworn statement was written by Los Angeles Police detective Orlando Martinez to outline probable cause for warrants to search Murray's offices, home and storage rooms in Texas and Nevada. Murray told detectives he had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks, giving him 50 milligrams of propofol, the generic name for Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip, the affidavit said. Worried that Jackson might become addicted to the drug, Murray said he tried to wean Jackson from it, putting together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping him sleep during the two nights before his death. But on the morning of June 25 other drugs failed to do the job. Murray recounted the events to detectives in an hour-by-hour account that was detailed by Martinez: . • About 1:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson 10 mg of Valium (diazepam). • About 2 a.m., he injected Jackson with 2 mg of the antianxiety drug Ativan (lorazepam). • About 3 a.m., Murray then administered 2 mg of the sedative Versed (midazolam). • About 5 a.m., he administered another 2 mg of Ativan. • About 7:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson yet another 2 mg of Versed while monitoring him with a device that measures the oxygen saturation of his blood. • About 10:40 a.m., ""after repeated demands/requests from Jackson,"" Murray administered 25 mg of propofol, the document said. ""Jackson finally went to sleep and Murray stated that he remained monitoring him. After approximately 10 minutes, Murray stated he left Jackson's side to go to the restroom and relieve himself. Murray stated he was out of the room for about two minutes maximum. Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing."" Efforts at CPR proved fruitless. Jackson was pronounced dead at UCLA Medical Center at 2:26 p.m. Earlier this week, Murray's lawyer disputed the final section of the timeline. ""Dr. Murray simply never told investigators that he found Michael Jackson at 11 a.m. not breathing,"" Chernoff said. ""He also never said that he waited a mere 10 minutes before leaving to make several phone calls. In fact, Dr. Murray never said that he left Michael Jackson's room to make phone calls at all."" In Friday, Chernoff criticized the coroner's office for making the  ""contains nothing new."" ""For two months we have been hearing the same information, usually from leaks out of the coroner's office,"" Chernoff said. ""One has to wonder why the coroner felt compelled to release anything at all if the police investigation is not yet complete."" Agents from the California attorney general's office also will investigate physicians whose names have come up in the course of the Jackson death probe, Attorney General Jerry Brown said. The federal drug administration also responded with its own independent investigations ""into matters that the LAPD's investigation uncovered that may not be directly related to the cause of death,"" the agency said. Last week Drug Enforcement agents executed a federal administrative search warrant at the Mickey Fine Pharmacy in Beverly Hills, California, looking for prescription records relating to Jackson, an agency spokesman said. The pharmacy sits directly below the offices of Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein. Shortly before his death, Jackson visited the building several times to see Klein. Klein, who treated Jackson for decades, denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. Attorney General Brown said that agents with his Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement ""will review relevant records and documents."" The attorney general's office maintains a computerized prescription drug monitoring system that tracks controlled substances.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's Security Cabinet announced Thursday the country won't hold peace negotiations with a Palestinian government backed by the militant Hamas movement. The development came a day after Palestinian rival movements Fatah and Hamas embarked on an effort to form a unity government. The Security Cabinet is the part of the Israeli full Cabinet tasked with making security decisions. ""Instead of choosing peace, Abu Mazen formed an alliance with a murderous terrorist organization that calls for the destruction of Israel,' said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, referring to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""Whoever chooses the terrorism of Hamas does not want peace."" The latest development comes amid deterioration of U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel -- talks that Hamas, a militant Islamic group that hasn't recognized Israel, opposed. Fatah dominates the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu said the agreement between Abbas and Hamas was signed ""even as Israel is making efforts to advance the negotiations with the Palestinians. ""It is the direct continuation of the Palestinians' refusal to advance the negotiations,"" Netanyahu said. ""Only last month, Abu Mazen rejected the framework principles proposed by the United States. Abu Mazen has refused to even discuss recognizing Israel as the national state of the Jewish people. He violated existing agreements by unilaterally applying to accede to international treaties and then formed an alliance with Hamas."" Netanyahu noted that the convenant for Hamas ""calls for Muslims to fight and kill Jews. Hamas has fired more than 10,000 missiles and rockets at Israeli territory and has not halted terrorist actions against Israel even for a minute."" Thursday's announcement came on a day that the Israeli military and Palestinian militants clashed near the fence separating northern Gaza and Israel. Israel's military said a bomb detonated along the fence in a ""failed attempt to hurt Israeli soldiers,"" and that Israeli forces responded. The military did not elaborate. Palestinian security sources said militants tried to target an Israeli military vehicle on the Gaza side of the border area, and that there were heavy exchanges of fire. Neither side reported injuries. Mustafa Barghouti: ""Palestinians are in a unified camp"" Fatah and Hamas announced Wednesday they will begin discussions to form a unity government. An interim government could be finalized in the next five weeks, with elections possible by early 2015, Fatah spokesman Fayez Abu Eitta said. After the reconciliation was announced, Netanyahu's office said Israel canceled peace negotiations that were scheduled to take place Wednesday night. Israel and the Palestinian Authority face an April 29 deadline to agree on a framework for a comprehensive peace treaty, but the sides appear far apart. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian lawmaker involved in the Hamas-Fatah talks, hailed what he called the ""end to the division between the Palestinian people."" ""Palestinians are in a unified camp, and Israel cannot claim that Palestinians cannot negotiate on behalf of all Palestinians,"" Barghouti told CNN on Wednesday. The Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank have been run separately for seven years. The split began taking shape in 2006 when Hamas, participating in Palestinian polls for the first time, won a majority in the Palestinian parliament. The Palestinian Authority formed a coalition government with Hamas that year, with Abbas retaining the presidency and Hamas member Ismail Haniya becoming prime minister. But when Abbas dissolved the government in 2007, Hamas seized control of Gaza, and Haniya became Gaza's de facto political leader. The West for years has shown support to Fatah and warned it not to join hands with militant Hamas, which several countries have deemed a terrorist organization. Reconciliation talks started Tuesday evening, after Abbas sent a Fatah delegation to meet with Hamas representatives in Gaza. It wasn't immediately clear who would lead, though Abbas, whose Fatah group runs the West Bank, is a possibility for premier, Abu Eitta said.

"(CNN) -- Do you ever get sick of your phone ringing? What about Facebook fatigue? Does Twitter sometimes give you stress headaches, making you occasionally wish you could just yank the plug on your online life? Do you get nervous when your smart phone rings? A report says you're not alone. Well, you're not alone, according to a recent report from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a nonprofit research group in Washington. The report, written by John Horrigan, the project's associate director of research, says 7 percent of Americans use the Internet as their primary means of social communication and also feel conflicted about that fact. These online social network users, which Horrigan calls ""ambivalent networkers,"" are so connected they feel like they can't quit. But Horrigan, who counts himself among this group, says there is hope for these conflicted techies.Take a quiz to find out what kind of tech user you are . ""I do think it's a matter of society and individuals in society understanding these tools. So tools can be used for good and tools can be used for ill as well. They can have negative impacts,"" he said. CNN spoke with Horrigan by phone about the various ways people are using cell phones and the Internet today, including the 14 percent of people who use neither. The following is an edited version of that conversation: . CNN: Tell me about the report. Horrigan: We recently produced a report called ""The Mobile Difference,"" which places American adults into 10 different user types, depending on how they feel about information technology, what kind of information technology they have in their lives and how they use information technology in their lives. CNN: You give the names for these categories some fun titles. Tell me more about what we know about these groups of people. Horrigan: The most high-tech group we labeled the ""digital collaborators."" The digital collaborators are the ones with the most technology, doing the most with it and loving it the most, and really are about not just using technology to communicate with others but to cultivate their creative lives. Another is the ""ambivalent networkers,"" which is a fun group in that they're the youngest of any group ... they're the most active in using mobile devices for a range of different purposes, yet, at the same time they express fairly high levels of concern about always being available to others. CNN: I find that group interesting. What's behind that conflicted sentiment? Horrigan: There's a sense that it might be costly for them not to be on the network. So if you think of that group of ""ambivalent networkers"" as being a youthful group, all of whom have cell phones, probably the very majority of their social networks are online. They're always texting or communicating or e-mailing to keep in touch and make plans. So if you're in a social milieu like that and you want a break, you may feel like going off the grid would be a bad thing, because you won't know what your friends are up to, you won't know what the plan is for Saturday evening, or you might worry that your friends will be worried if you're not instantly responsive to their queries. CNN: Do you have a sense whether those negative feelings are a growing trend, or if people are becoming more mobile and on the whole are liking it? Horrigan: What I think the message is with all these new tools -- Twitter, for instance -- is that Twitter is a great way to put yourself out there. It also could be a tool for managing your connectivity. You might start to use your Facebook page or your Twitter account as a means to say, ""Hey guys, I'm shutting down for a while, so don't worry about me if I don't respond to you immediately."" So I think a challenge for people going forward is to see these tools as tools, meaning you can use them to identify yourself as being offline at a particular moment, and not see them as perpetual obligations to be available at all times to all people. CNN: Have you heard of any interesting ways people might be dealing with that? Horrigan: I think it's fairly well known in the tech community that traffic for blogs and so-forth dives on the weekends, so I think people tend to use the weekends as a way to take a little bit of a breather. CNN: The people who are off the network entirely, do you have a sense if that population is growing, or if those people will eventually end up on the network? Horrigan: The off-network share of Americans was approximately the same in 2008 as it was in 2006, when we looked at it before. I think that will shrink over time as people become more dependent on the cell phone, which we do see as a rising trend. People who are off the network tend to be older and lower income. I think as time marches on you'll see technology that's tailored more towards older Americans. So we can expect that [group] to shrink over time, but maybe not at a tremendously rapid rate. CNN: If you were to pick one of these groups, which would you fall into? Horrigan: I took the test and I was an ""ambivalent networker."" I answered on the quiz that I sometimes don't get all too charged up when that cell phone rings or vibrates. So I'm someone who does like to have a bit of a break from the Internet from time to time or with cell phone availability. And I kind of struggle with that occasionally. CNN: How do you handle that? Horrigan: It's a matter of self-discipline: turning the cell phone off from time to time and spending, when I can, part of the workday not in front of the computer.","CNN talks with researcher about how people today use phone and Internet .

"(CNN) -- A Texas woman has been arrested as a suspect in an alleged kidnapping of a boy eight years ago, the San Augustine County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. The woman, Krystle Tanner of San Augustine, was the godmother of Miguel Antonio Morin, who was 8 months old when he and Tanner went missing, the boy's mother, Auboni Champion-Morin, told CNN Wednesday. Tanner, also a neighbor, had been babysitting the boy in her Houston home, she said. San Augustine is about 165 miles northeast of Houston. The boy, now 8, was in good physical condition Monday and was in the custody of Texas Child Protective Services, said sheriff's Chief Deputy Gary Cunningham. The mother filed a police report in 2004, but Houston police closed the case two years later after prosecutors asked for clarification of the date the boy disappeared and Houston police were ""unable to clarify that information,"" Cunningham said. Tanner was arrested Monday in connection with the boy's kidnapping after Child Protective Services began investigating her in August on allegations of negligently supervising her children and an unknown 8-year-old child who had been physically abused, Cunningham said. In an interview Wednesday, Champion-Morin expressed joy and disbelief that Miguel, the youngest of her five children at the time of his disappearance, had been finally found. Authorities did not give details about who was taking care of the boy when he was found. When Champion-Morin received a phone call Monday from the child welfare agency, ""I kind of had to look at the phone -- was this real?"" said the mother, who had a sixth child after her son's disappearance. She wondered if authorities' call was a cruel joke, she said. She was asked about the disappearance of her son and his connection to Tanner, she said. ""At first, it kind of scared me,"" she said. She was thinking about her son in recent days because his birthday was March 1. The child protection agency told Champion-Morin that Tanner had been arrested in east Texas, but that her son was not with Tanner at the time, the mother said. Champion-Morin will undergo a blood test possibly this week to prove she is the biological mother, she said. On the night that her son and Tanner disappeared, Champion-Morin said she had asked Tanner to watch her son overnight. At the time, the mother had five children, all under age 4, and Miguel was the youngest. ""I was having hardship at the time,"" the mother said. ""I asked her to watch him overnight, and when I came back ... they were gone."" Tanner and the mother lived in the same apartment building, and Tanner wanted the boy to stay in her apartment and the other kids to stay at another friend's apartment, the mother said. Tanner was a high school student at the time and had to attend classes the next morning, but when Champion-Morin went to pick up her son that morning, he and Tanner were gone, Champion-Morin said. Tanner's mother said the two had left the state, Champion-Morin said. She called police, she said. The mother knew Tanner and her family well, and they spent a lot of time together, she said. ""At that time, I trusted her, I knew her,"" Champion-Morin said. Police asked her to take a polygraph and she agreed, but because she was pregnant at the time police told her she could not take it then, Champion-Morin said. She never knew police had closed the case back in 2006, and she assumed all along they were still working on it, she said. She called Houston Police several times to check on the case over the years and was always told she had a new police contact and the case had been assigned to someone else, the mother said. She found the experience frustrating and had not called back in a while, she said. Still, she thought often of her son, she said. ""I always wondered every night. I dreamed and prayed on it,"" she said. She explained Miguel's disappearance to his siblings ""the best I could,"" she said. ""They still somewhat don't understand the situation, why (someone) would do that,"" Champion-Morin said. Her children now ""are trying to make sure I stay calm"" and are ""praying with me,"" the mom said. Miguel could be returned to her ""by the end of the week,"" she said. ""I'm going to let him know I love him with all my heart ... and any questions he has, I will answer them,"" Champion-Morin said. ""It will be hard."" ""We will probably have to go to a psychiatrist together,"" she said, adding it will also be opportunity to work out their relationship and get to know one another. When asked how she felt about how Houston police handled the case, she said, ""It took years to get some sort of progress. This took years ... a lot of running around and nobody helping me."" The boy was reported missing in November 2004, and after an investigation, Houston police presented the case to the Harris County district attorney's office for review in February 2005, Cunningham said. The prosecutor accepted the case, but a warrant was never issued because the prosecutor's office apparently asked for clarification of the precise date when the boy was taken, Cunningham said. Houston police was unable to clarify that information, and the case was closed in 2006, Cunningham said. An Amber Alert was never issued for the boy because the Houston Regional Amber Alert Plan was never notified, said coordinator Beth Alberts. Houston Police Department investigators are now looking into the case, including why an Amber Alert was never requested, spokesman Kese Smith said Wednesday. In August 2011, the state child welfare agency received a report against Tanner about alleged negligence of her children, Cunningham said. An 8-year-old boy was reportedly ""hit on,"" Cunningham said. The report didn't suggest the alleged negligence was egregious, but the child welfare authority initiated an investigation and attempted to identify the 8-year-old child in the report, Cunningham said. Tanner allegedly gave the child welfare agency's investigators contradictory information about the 8-year-old boy, saying the child was hers and then wasn't hers, that the child belonged to her brother or someone else, Cunningham said. The state agency then called the sheriff's office, which eventually opened a criminal investigation in January after authorities couldn't find the child, Cunningham said. Tanner again allegedly provided misleading information to the sheriff's investigators, Cunningham said. The child welfare agency then provided sheriff's investigators with a possible identity of the missing child, and San Augustine County prosecutors secured a warrant for Tanner, Cunningham said. ""We interviewed her again (Wednesday) and she provided additional information,"" Cunningham said. ""She admitted that she provided misleading information, which certainly supports our belief that she kidnapped the child.""","NEW: Houston police are looking at why an Amber Alert was never issued in 2004 case .

"(CNN) -- This week's death of Prince Charles' brother-in-law, who passed away in New York City after injuring his head in a fall, was accidental, the city medical examiner's office said Thursday. Mark Shand, brother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, died from ""blunt impact head trauma with a skull fracture and subdural hematoma,"" according to Julie Bolcer, spokeswoman for the medical examiner. A subdural hematoma is a traumatic injury in which blood pools between two protective layers of the brain. Prince Charles' official residence, Britain's Clarence House, said Wednesday that Shand, 62, died in a New York hospital after injuring his head in a fall on Tuesday night. ""The Duchess, The Prince of Wales and all her family members are utterly devastated by this sudden and tragic loss,"" the Clarence House statement read. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge issued a statement that said the couple was saddened by the death. ""Their thoughts are with The Duchess of Cornwall and her family at this time,"" the statement said. The Elephant Family, a conservation group based in England, mourned the loss of its chairman and the ""head of our family."" ""Mark Shand was a true force for conservation. He was both a legend and inspiration and above all our great friend,"" the organization said in a statement on its website. CNN profiled the charity, which was working to improve conditions for Asian elephants, in 2007. Shand said he was trying to show owners and riders more humane ways to treat the animals. ""You can't stop a tradition that's been going on for years, you can only help it,"" he said. His group also fought against poachers and the destruction of the elephants' habitats. Shand also was the author of several books about elephants and his travels in Asia. One of those books, ""Queen of Elephants,"" was the source for a BBC documentary. People we lost in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- A blast from the steam whistle on a cherry-red locomotive sends a gathering of locals on a platform scuttling with delight in the town of Durán, Ecuador. It's a sound many in this town on the tropical Pacific plain haven't heard in years. Some never have. A restored, century-old steam locomotive grinds slowly out from its rail shed. Vapor from its smokestack hangs in the humid air surrounding Durán Station. In a few days, that vapor will crystallize in the freezing temperatures of the Ecuadorian Andes as the throwback Tren Crucero threads its way past giant snow-capped peaks into the realm of condors, volcanoes and Andean legend. Great steam train revived . Trains in Ecuador have been virtually moribund since the late 1990s. ""Strong winter rains of El Niño in 1982 destroyed a stretch of the railroad between Huigra and Bucay,"" says Slav Ivanov of Ferrocariles del Ecuador, the train's operators. ""Further damage occurred during El Niño floods during the 1990s."" ‪By 2008, only about 10% of the Ecuadorian train network was operational. Since then, the Ecuadorean government has spent some $280 million revamping the national railway. ‬ . The flagship of the railway's renaissance is Tren Crucero, a revamped luxury steam train operating a new cross-Andean service between Guayaquil and the capital of Quito (at 2,849 meters the highest capital city in the world). Tren Crucero -- literally ""cruise train"" -- follows a 453-kilometer (282 mile) narrow-gauge line originally constructed between 1897 and 1908 along Ecuador's Andean spine. The railway was built to connect Ecuador's two major cities: Quito in the Andes and Guayaquil along the Pacific. Now as then, it's one of the most thrilling railway journeys in the world. Today's luxurious four-day, three-night journey targets foreign tourists and affluent Ecuadorians. Tickets cost $1,200 for adults ($952 for children) and include all hotels and excursions en route. The train's newly purchased carriages, built in Madrid, are pulled by restored steam locomotives. The oldest dates to 1900 and was engineered by American manufacturer Baldwin of Pennsylvania. One of the locomotive's engineers is 52-year-old Edgar Garces, a 28-year employee with Ecuador's national railway company. ""I didn't think I'd see the cross-Andean train running again in my lifetime,"" he says. Few others did. Tourism revamps trains, communities . Ecuador's government wants Tren Crucero to boost economically depressed communities along its route through tourism. From Guayaquil into the Guayas coastal plain, abandoned settlements such as Casiguana testify to the economic malaise. This former orange-growing village was deserted when the railway's demise severed its trade link to Guayaquil. Further up the line, in Yaguachi, 75-year-old Alejandro Diaz-Lopez waits track-side for Tren Crucero, plucking his guitar and singing ballads about the train. ""I sing a song for the train; for the president; for the tourists who now bring our community money,"" he says. Tren Crucero's most exhilarating section is a series of precipitous switchbacks that enable the train to ascend 2,945 meters (9,662 feet) in just 56 kilometers (34 miles) around a mountainside called the Devil's Nose. By 1908, this hazardous section had taken four years to build and contributed to more than 4,000 deaths among workers, including 2,730 Jamaican laborers. At Alausi, a town of largely Quechua indigenous inhabitants, 30-year-old Rosita Logrono sells beautiful hand-knitted llama wool garments at the station's newly created souvenir bazaar. ""Before the railway returned I only had part-time work and couldn't send my children to school,"" she says. ""Since the trains returned life is much better."" Avenue of the Volcanoes is highlight . The journey to Quito passes 10 volcanoes along the so-called Avenue of Volcanoes. The highest point (3,609 meters/11,480 feet) comes on day three at Urbina, where a new visitor's center has been built. Here, the last iceman of Chimborazo greets passengers. Balthasar Uscha, 69, has cut ice from Chimborazo volcano's flanks for 50 years; at 6,310 meters (20,100 feet) Chimborazo is Ecuador's highest mountain. Taking into account the planet's equatorial bulge, Chimborazo's summit is further from the Earth's core than Everest. Uscha's glacial ice once chilled the drinks of coastal dwellers. But refrigeration has put the ice cutters out of business. He says he represents the last survivor of his profession. Last stop, but not the end of the line . Tren Crucero passengers disembark each night and stay in local hotels. The final night's accommodation is La Cienaga, a glorious Spanish hacienda built 1695. The great naturalist, Alexander von Humboldt, who stayed here 1802, coined the term ""Avenue of Volcanoes."" The hacienda is located within view of snow-capped Cotopaxi; at 5,879 meters (19,300 feet), it's one of the highest active volcanoes in the world. The final day begins at Latacunga. The city has been destroyed on three occasions by eruptions from Cotopaxi, which historically erupts about every century. Now overdue, the last eruption to destroy Latacunga was in 1904. Thoughts of such calamities, however, are far away. As the train rumbles into its last stop at Quito, only the bright sun of restoration shines on the rails and the faces of disembarking passengers, thrilled to have completed one of the great -- and largely undiscovered -- journeys in the world. The 280-mile journey from Quito to Guayaquil takes four days and three nights (with stops and hotels included), crosses Ecuador's Andes and passes from moorlands through cloud forests to tropical coastal landscapes; $1,270 adults, $952 children.
