Murderer: Heather Emmonds, pictured, was found guilty of murdering her daughter-in-law Tina Casey . A grandmother who stabbed her daughter-in-law to death in a frenzied attack because she feared never seeing her grandson again has been found guilty of murder. Heather Emmonds, 58, killed 42-year-old Tina Casey after being told she was moving to the Isle of Man and would never see her grandson again. Newcastle Crown Court heard how in Frebruary this year she approached Miss Casey from behind as she lay on a sofa, then stabbed her 15 times in the neck and stomach with a filleting knife. She then tried to burn her clothes and dispose of the weapon, but was found by police the next day with letters of confession after she crashed her car. The jury heard how Emmonds, of Seaton Deleval, Northumberland, had tried to poison Miss Casey twice before by adding powdered sleeping pills to a chili and a sweet-and-sour meal she had made for her. Miss Casey had been in an 'on/off' relationship with Emmonds's son Keith, and the jury heard how the two had clashed over access to the young boy, with Emmonds accused of being a 'bad grandmother'. Emmonds could now face a minimum of 25 years in jail for her crime. She admitted killing Miss Casey in letters to police, but had denied murder on the grounds of loss of control and diminished responsibility. In one of the letters found in Emmonds's crashed car, she wrote to her grandson in an attempt to justify killing his mother. She said: 'Please don’t hate me for what I have done. I . really thought it was the best for you. 'I know it won’t look like it . but dad is a great dad for you so be good for him and gramps. I will always love you.' Victim: Miss Casey was stabbed 15 times in the neck and stomach as she lay on a sofa . The jury, of five women and seven men, deliberated for just two hours before finding her guilty of murder and having an offensive weapon. She put her hand over her mouth and wept silently when the guilty verdict was returned at Newcastle Crown Court. Judge Milford QC, sitting at Newcastle Crown Court, adjourned the sentence until tomorrow. He told Emmonds: 'You have been . convicted or murder and the only sentence I can impose is a sentence of . life imprisonment, but I must decide what that minimum sentence will . be.' The trial heard how . Emmonds told detectives she had gone to Miss Casey’s home on February 3 . and an argument erupted after she was told she couldn't take her . grandson out for lunch. Emmonds . said during a police interview: 'She said I am taking [him] back to the . Isle of Man, you are never going to see him again and I don’t care. He’s going back to my family, you won’t see him again.' She how she saw a knife on a nearby table. She went on to describe the murder, saying 'I grabbed it and I stabbed her and I fought with her and I stabbed her several times.' Emmonds, who called Miss Casey an 'evil and scheming woman', said she felt 'numb' after the killing. Scene: Miss Casey's body was discovered with multiple stab wounds on her sofa in Holywell in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside . She considered setting Miss Casey's home on fire, with her body inside, to mask her actions, but said she had been put off by watching crime dramas, saying she had 'seen too many CSIs to know it doesn’t really work'. The court heard how Emmonds had taken a change of clothing with her to Tina’s house and had attempted to burn her blood-stained clothes and the murder weapon with lighter fuel at a nearby stables. Prosecutors said Emmonds carried out the killing so her young grandson would not be moved to the Isle of Man, while her defence lawyers said the killing was not premeditated, that she had lost her self control and suffered from a depressive illness. In the days before the killing Miss Casey had told police she feared she was being poisoned by her mother-in-law. Trial: Defendant Heather Emmonds had denied murder on grounds of diminished responsibility, but was found guilty of the crime by a jury . The judge said: 'On Saturday 2nd February Tina rang NHS direct and claimed that she had been poisoned - and so she had. The defendant had taken her a meal laced with sleeping tablets. 'The defendant does not dispute what she did. She said she didn’t want to kill Tina just to make her ill so Tina wouldn’t shout at her.” During the trial Emmonds told Newcastle Crown Court: 'I don’t know what the trigger was to pick up the knife. I won’t know until I die, I have no idea.' While in a letter addressed to police, she said: 'I didn’t intend to kill Tina Casey, it was a moment of madness and impulse. 'The knife and my clothes are in the boot of my car. The knife was mine but I lent it to Tina Casey. There was no preconceived plan. It just happened. I went onto auto-pilot, not eating or sleeping, I have never harmed anyone in my life. 'I am ashamed of my actions.' After the case the victim’s family said in a statement: 'We’re really going to continue to miss Tina, especially her children and the rest of the family, both now and in the future. 'No one has won in this case, both sides of the family have lost a mother, one has died and another is in jail, through tragic circumstances. 'Both sides in this case have shown great dignity and have conducted themselves impeccably throughout this trial. 'We’d like to thank the police for their support and Victim Support who have both helped the family through this very difficult time. 'We hope everyone now can start to get on with their lives and put this behind us.” Outside court, Detective Superintendent Steve Wade said: 'This crime has had a devastating effect on the family of Tina Casey and I’d like to thank them for their support and courage throughout this investigation. 'This was a horrific attack which resulted in the death of a mother and has left her family bereft. 'We welcome the decision of the jury and hope that it brings some closure for the family to know Heather Emmonds will spend a substantial period behind bars. 'My thoughts are with them at this difficult time.'","Heather Emmonds, 58, killed Tina Cassey with a filleting knife in February .

When banker Keith Owen was diagnosed with cancer and given only eight weeks to live, he started to think of ways to leave his mark. In the end he said it with flowers – one million of them to be precise – leaving them to the seaside town he had fallen in love with. Shortly before his death, Mr Owen, 69, a Canadian citizen, took the astonishingly generous decision to change his will and leave his £2.3million fortune to Sidmouth in Devon. Improvement: Sidmouth in Devon has received £2.3million to help beautify the seaside town . Planting: One million flower bulbs are set to be planted throughout the town thanks to Keith Owen . Generous: The banker left £2.3million to the town in his will when he died in December 2007 . His . one condition was that the money should be spent on keeping the town . ‘beautiful’, and he suggested residents should embark on a project to . plant one million bulbs. Now . Mr Owen’s dying wish is about to become reality as the community . prepares to plant 153,000 flowers – or nearly ten for each of the town’s . 17,000 residents – in the first phase of a massive operation. Mr Owen was born in nearby Totnes. He became an RAF pilot, but in 1976 moved to Canada where he worked as an investment banker. He . would regularly return for holidays in Sidmouth, where his mother . retired, describing it as the picture-perfect English resort. Scenic: Parks, gardens and verges are all benefiting from the work funded by Mr Owen's bequest . Bulbs: Officials have now started the work of planting a million flowers as Mr Owen suggested . Project: Staff at the Sidmouth Garden Centre have been stockpiling a huge number of bulbs . He . even became a member of the Rotary club and supporter of the Sid Vale . Association, Britain’s oldest civic society founded in 1846. Then . on a trip to the UK in 2007, he was given the devastating news he had . lung cancer. He urgently gathered civic leaders to discuss the gift . before changing his will. Mr . Owen, who was divorced with no children, left £1.5million in cash and . £800,000 in property to the SVA after his death in early 2008. The . will stated that the capital should remain untouched but each year the . estimated £120,000 interest should be spent on sprucing up Sidmouth and . the nearby villages of Sidford and Sidbury. Beloved: Mr Owen's mother lived in Sidmouth and he loved spending his holidays in the town . Devoted: The money to plant flowers and carry out other projects came from a portfolio of investments and property . Around . £400,000 of Mr Owen’s money has already been spent on youth projects, . including a new scout hut. Now volunteers are getting ready to complete . the first phase of the planting project, sowing £166,000 worth of . daffodils, snowdrops, crocuses and other bulbs. The . 153,000 flowers will be planted during a special community day in two . months’ time, with Sidmouth Garden Centre stockpiling the bulbs in . preparation. Alan Darrant, . chairman of the SVA, said: ‘Keith spoke in detail about the kind of . things he wanted the money spent on. On one occasion he said, “Think of . things that will get everyone together – I don’t know, plant a million . bulbs”. ‘So we’re going to do exactly that. We will be planting the bulbs at over 50 sites – roadsides, park land and public gardens. ‘We can then sit back and, in spring, see what has sprung.’ Picturesque: Sidmouth attracts more than 100,000 visitors each year to its scenic beaches .

A man known as ‘The Bonfire King’ who organised Britain’s biggest Guy Fawkes Night party for 50 years has been given an explosive send-off after his ashes were shot into the sky. Keith Austin spent half a century as the driving force behind the massive Bonfire night celebrations in Lewes, Sussex, which draws tens of thousands of spectators every year. The local councillor and charity fundraiser, who was secretary of his local bonfire society for many years, died in September aged 75. He was given a fitting send-off on Tuesday night when his ashes were strapped to rockets and blasted into the air as part of the fireworks show. Fitting send-off: Keith Austin, pictured left, who organised the Lewes Bonfire Night for 50 years, became a part of the firework display on Tuesday when his ashes were shot into the sky in a rocket, pictured right . Tribute: Keith Austin was known as 'The Bonfire King' because of his pivotal role in organising the Lewes Guy Fawkes Night celebration which is believed to be the biggest in the world . Officials say an estimated 30,000 people were there when Mr Austin - known locally as ‘Mr Bonfire’ and ‘The Bonfire King’ - was shot into the sky and exploded in colour. Duncan Roy, of the Cliffe Bonfire Society, said: 'This really was an extraordinary tribute to someone who touched all our lives. 'We sent him up in the first and last rocket of the night, as a way to say goodbye to a dear friend.' Tim Knight, president of bonfire society, said: 'He was a fervent bonfire person. It would have tickled him pink.' Off with a bang: Crowds gather to watch the spectacular torch bearing procession through the streets of Lewes in East Sussex on Tuesday . Participants carry burning crucifixes through the spectator-lined streets to commemorate the martyrdom which occurred between 1555 and 1557 . Lewes MP Norman Baker said: 'I was in contact with Keith over many years about bonfire matters. 'I admired his straight-talking, his determination and his integrity, and generally had a lot of time for him. He is a loss to the town and to the bonfire in particular.' Best friend Nick Quinn added: 'He will be up there having a good giggle.' The Lewes Bonfire Night Celebrations is said to be the biggest November 5th event in the world and includes a costume parade.

The chef has credited her with introducing him to mindfulness meditation . He once admitted chasing  his enemies with a meat cleaver  during a spectacular fit of rage. But Heston Blumenthal has revealed his legendary temper is now under control thanks to a surprising technique – food-based ‘mindful meditation’. After trying faith-healing and cranial osteopathy the celebrity chef, who is famed for his bizarre culinary creations, has learned to unwind by concentrating his thoughts on what he eats. In an interview with Radio Times the 47-year-old was described as still in the process of divorcing his wife Zanna – who first encouraged him to seek help for his anger – more than two years after they split. However, he explained he has not given up in his quest for self-control, saying: ‘Mindfulness is just  brilliant. You can be mindful with a raisin, even. You look at the raisin – how does it feel? ‘Look at the light and the dark and wonder where the shadows have been cast. 'You draw that out for a minute or two and then you put it in your mouth, and focus on your lips, tongue, teeth… It’s about being completely in the moment.’ He said his anger-management is so successful that he has not lost his cool at all in recent years, adding: ‘Not even a frown. It’s like I’m a different person. Really weird.’ Mr Blumenthal has admitted to once chasing someone who enraged him with a meat cleaver, but is now feeling much calmer . The self-taught chef was first encouraged to seek help for his fiery temper by 48-year-old Zanna, with whom he has three children. He later revealed he saw a cranial osteopath, a therapist and a faith healer on her suggestion. New love: Heston is now dating writer Suzanne Pirret . Their 20-year marriage came to an end in 2011 after the stress of managing his multi-million-pound food empire took its toll on their relationship. He subsequently started dating 47-year-old American actress turned cookery writer Suzanne Pirret, with whom he now lives. But in his latest interview, Blumenthal made the surprising revelation that he has yet to divorce his wife. He said: ‘The divorce is taking quite a long time but we are on the same page and we can communicate.’ Earlier this year Blumenthal spoke frankly about his long struggle to control his temper. He said: ‘Once, I really went for someone. I was in my car and chased someone right down the middle of a High Street – in reverse. I wasn’t very good at expressing emotion, so it was much easier to punch people. It was almost bordering on the psychotic. ‘Oh God, and there was that thing with the gun and the meat cleaver. Some cowboy builders sent some heavies round to my gran’s to get their money and I lost it and pulled a gun out – my dad had it for shooting crows – and chased them with a meat cleaver. They didn’t get their money.’ Blumenthal, who is filming Channel 4 series Heston’s Great British Food, is renowned for his adventurous brand of cooking he describes as ‘molecular gastronomy’. He has lucrative advertising deals with Waitrose and owns Michelin-starred restaurant The Fat Duck in Berkshire. But he revealed he does not want his eldest son Jack, 21, to follow him in his career, saying: ‘He wants to go into cooking but I told him, “I’ll push you away. I’m going to keep dissuading you because the only reason you should ever become a chef is because you want to do it so hard, and you’re going to have to work so hard at it”.’","Chef credits mindfulness meditation with helping him to become calmer .

We've seen countless examples of them from Rihanna, Cara Delevingne, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry .  .  . and even the Pope. But as these pictures show, supermodel Yasmin Le Bon has added an extra-large helping of glamour to the ‘selfie’ fad – employing a lighting rig, a top-of- the-range camera and all the other trimmings of a fashion shoot – to take the ultimate self-portrait. The selfie – defined as ‘a photograph that one has taken of oneself’ – has taken off to such a degree in 2013 that the term was last week named Word of the Year by the Oxford English Dictionary. Yasmin does the ultimate selfie by styling and taking the photos herself with a professional camera . And as one of most photographed women in the world, Mrs Le Bon, wife  of Duran Duran frontman Simon, was clearly determined to go one better than Lady Gaga and Co with her example of how it should be done. With a Vivienne Westwood cape draped around her shoulders in one shot, dramatic make-up and spotlights to accentuate her high cheekbones and seemingly never-ending legs, the 49-year-old still managed to press the button to take  selfies that put all other smartphone and tablet efforts to shame. Mrs Le Bon is close friends with Miranda Hart who is the guest editor of the magazine's 200th edition . The supermodel organised the extravagant shoot after being asked to photograph herself by Miranda Hart as part of a feature in a special 200th edition of Stylist magazine, which the comedy star is guest-editing. Mrs Le Bon and Ms Hart are close friends, having attended a number of charity functions in recent years. Other celebrities who helped out for the milestone issue include TV chef Nigella Lawson, artist Tracey Emin and athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill. Last Tuesday ‘selfie’ beat other shortlisted words to become the defining word of 2013. It faced competition from ‘twerk’, the raunchy dance routine performed – to the fury of concerned parents – by singer Miley Cyrus at the MTV video awards in August, and the online-only currency ‘bitcoin’. Others considered by editors included ‘showrooming’, the practice of browsing in shops before leaving and buying the same products online, and ‘binge-watch’, a term used to describe viewing all episodes of a television series in one sitting. Previous winners of the defining word title include ‘chav’ in 2004 and ‘credit-crunch’ in 2008. Richard Holden, editor of Oxford Dictionaries Online explained: ‘Like  a lot of words, selfie has got a much longer history than you might imagine. ‘The first evidence we could find of it was from 2002 in an internet forum post in Australia. Someone posted a pictures of themselves after a drunken fall  and wrote, “Apologies for the quality, it’s a selfie.” Miranda Hart has roped in 28 famous friends to help her guest edit the latest edition of Stylist Magazine . ‘Although it has been around for a few years in social media, in the past year we have found a 17,000 per cent increase in usage in our monitoring, as it’s gone from being something mainly used in social media to something that hits the mainstream. Word of the Year is not just  about pure frequency, it’s about whether it captures something about the year – whether it’s iconic.’ Editors are now considering including ‘selfie’ in the next print edition of the Oxford English Dictionary after adding it to the web version.","Model used top-of-the-range camera to pose for amazing shots .

Loitering by the side of the dusty motorway in a skimpy lilac dress which hung loose from her birdlike body, the girl looked lost and painfully alone in the dark Brazilian night. It was 1.30am and there was no obvious explanation why she should be on a nightmarish stretch of road rather than asleep in her own bed. But the deeply disturbing truth was this. At the age of 11, Leliah, with her childlike and fragile limbs, was selling herself for sex to any truck driver prepared to pay. Scroll down for video . Sold for sex: Leilah, 11, standing by the side of the dusty motorway as she waits for truck drivers to pick her up . Trapped in prostitution: Thousands of underage girls who are sold for sex every ten miles along Brazil's 2,7000 BR-116 motorway . ‘When he’s finished he throws me out . of the cab’, she said, showing her battered and bruised elbows. ‘Sometimes they let me climb down, or sometimes they just kick me out . onto the concrete. ‘But I never sell myself short. I charge 25 reals (£10) a time’. For . British journalist Matt Roper, this chance meeting with Leliah was to . change his life. He drove off along the BR-116 motorway, a merciless . 2,700-mile stretch of road spearing up the coast of Brazil from Rio de . Janerio to Fortaleza, in a state of profound shock. Later he decided to investigate and write about the forgotten children who eke out a living on the Highway to Hell. And despite being a hardened news reporter, nothing had prepared him for the scale of depravity he was to uncover. Abandoned: Lilian, a 12-year-old whose mother abandoned her. Her neighbour forced her to prostitute herself, but she was later stabbed in the neck at a bar and fell pregnant . Left: Mara, 16, left,  performed an abortion on herself after being raped by her landlord and right, Josilene, 15, who would end up miles away from home on the motorway after selling her body . Leliah . was just one of thousands of girls – some as young as nine - sold for . sex every ten miles along the BR-116. Many are prostituted by their own . families. The cheapest fee for a transaction is £8. 'I . was expecting to find something alarming, something that would make a . shocking investigative story, but never this,' Roper said. 'I’d stumbled . upon what appeared to be an epidemic of child prostitution, involving . thousands of young, innocent girls. 'Every . story I heard was more distressing than the last and the girls were all . so vulnerable, completely alone and unprotected. It broke my heart. 'I . later discovered a hushed-up Brazilian government report into the . motorway, which had identified 262 places along the motorway where . children were known to be sold for sex – that’s one, on average, every . ten miles. Dedicated: Matt Roper, centre, talks to local girls in Brazil. He moved to the South American country with his wife and young son in 2011 . With the help of children’s councillor Rita Marques, who is based in the town of Medina, Roper began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted before they had even reached adulthood . “I couldn’t understand how this tragedy had been kept hidden, unreported, for so long.” With . the help of children’s councillor Rita Marques, who is based in the . town of Medina, Roper began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted . before they had even reached adulthood. One of the most horrific cases involved a 16-year-old called Mara, who lived with her mother and two brothers in Serrinha. At . the age of 11, their landlord Jonas began to sell her for sex because . he gave the young girl food when her mother went to work. He . also raped her and she fell eventually pregnant. Jonas forced her to . carry out a horrific abortion using a coat hanger, leaving her bleeding . and distraught. She turned to drugs and is now being pimped out by . local gangsters. And then . there was Mariana. At 13, she was forced to sell her body on the . motorway by her own mother Maria. Sometimes her parent would even walk . her to the road, negotiate her price and then greedily snatch away the . money for cigarettes. If Mariana failed to attract a customer, she . would face a beating when she returned home. Safe haven: Determined to help the girls Roper set up a charity in the UK called Meninadança. With the funds raised the charity decided to create a safe space for the girls and now rent a building known by locals as the Pink House . Inspiring: The wall of the Pink House's dance class which reads: 'Don't be the girl who fell. Be the girl who got on her feet again' Hope: Run by Ms Marques, nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors since it opened at the beginning of the year, with around 60 coming to the project every day . Brazil’s . relaxed attitude to buying sex has long attracted international . criticism - UNICEF estimates there are 250,000 children into . prostitution across the country. And . as Brazil prepares to host the next World Cup and Olympics 2016, the . South American nation is under the pressure to break the growing problem . of child prostitution racket. Brazilian . law dictates that an adult subjecting a child to prostitution or sexual . exploitation is punishable by imprisonment for four to ten years and a . fine, but countless times Roper came across young girls who told him . their abuser had not been punished. He . even went on a raid with local police to track down girls being abused . in motels, although was disheartened by what he saw – police gave motel . owners enough time to warn their customers as well as giving up if . punters did not answer the door after a 10-minute wait. Roper had moved to Brazil with his wife Dani, 26, and their son Milo, three, in November 2011. He had always intended to write about the girls, but now he decided that he would also set up a charity to help them. Sisters Rebeca, 15, and Milene, 12, from the Chilli Peppers in Salgueiro. Rebeca is a mother of two - she has a two-year-old and six-month-old baby . Message: Girls who spend time at The Pink House paint a mural on the wall in their local community . Working . with his friend Canadian country singer Dean Brody who had been with . him on the night he met Leliah, Roper set up a charity called to Meninadança provide refuge for the children who had been forced into . prostitution. They established The Pink House in Medina, where visitors . can talk about their experiences, take dance and beauty classes and . find support. Run by Ms . Marques, nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors . since it opened at the beginning of the year, with around 60 coming to . the project every day. Meanwhile, . Roper had had a second encounter with the young girl who was . prostituting herself so her mother could afford cigarettes. Now she was 15, seven months pregnant and dancing for a scruffy, unshaven man in a brothel. ‘My . mum never cared about me. She was just interested in using me to buy . her cahaca. So I ran away. At least now I can keep the money for . myself’, she told him. Road of misery: Brazil's BR-116 motorway also known as the 'highway to hell' by the girls who sexually abused every day . With . the help of Ms Marques, Roper persuaded Mariana that she did not have to . stay in this sordid place. After persuading the town’s judge to . forcibly take her away from the mother who was exploiting her, the . journalist and his wife took her in and, despite being unable to keep . her baby, she has now settled into their home. Her 16th birthday was celebrated with a huge party. ‘I . wept as I saw her, beaming radiant, surrounded by new friends and . family. I could hardly believe she was the same girl we had found less . than a year ago, dancing lifelessly inside that dark oppressive roadside . brothel,’ Roper said. Later, . Roper and his wife took another girl into their home who workers at the . Pink House had discovered was in danger. Nathane, 13, was sleeping in . friends’ houses after her mother died, and was on the brink of falling . into the dark work of child prostitution that had snared so many. Despite successes with Mariana and the Pink House, there was one girl that Roper could not forget. Haunted by Leilah, the ghostly girl in the lilac dress, the journalist set out to find her. It . was too late. Still a prostitute on the Highway To Hell, she was now . heavily addicted to crack cocaine and desperate for cash to buy drugs. When Roper refused, she became furious and snarled: ‘Don’t bother coming back.’","Underage girls are sold for sex every ten miles along the BR-116 .

The News of the World did not delete the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the court heard yesterday. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told jurors there was no evidence to back up reports in The Guardian newspaper that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire had deleted voicemails from the teenager’s phone after she went missing. Incendiary claims that News of the World journalists erased the messages provoked public uproar and catapulted the phone hacking scandal into the spotlight. The Old Bailey heard that the News of the World did not delete messages from the voicemail of Milly Dowler . But Mr Edis said the tabloid was not responsible for giving her parents ‘false hope’. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told jurors there was no evidence Glenn Mulcaire deleted the messages . He said: ‘Milly Dowler’s mother, when . she called her daughter’s phone, heard a different message and she . thought that meant she might be still alive. ‘It was alleged that was the result of the deletion of voicemails by the phone hacker from her phone. There is no evidence for that at all. ‘No evidence that Mr Mulcaire ever deleted any voicemails from Milly Dowler’s phone.’ Timothy Langdale QC, representing Andy Coulson, also told jurors that the article published in 2011 was ‘pretty unjustifiable in a number of major respects’. He said: ‘The report made allegations that the News of the World interfered with police inquiries, that News of the World journalists had deleted voicemails on Milly Dowler’s phone, to free up space for more messages. ‘There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Mulcaire or any other person from the News of the World deleted any message on Milly Dowler’s phone, either deliberately or accidentally.’ Jurors were shown pages from Glenn Mulcaire’s notebooks with the details he used to hack the phone of Milly Dowler. The . page, with the name of ‘Neville’ in the top left hand corner, included . the murdered schoolgirl’s parents names Sally and Robert, alongside . their address, and a string of phone numbers. Mulcaire, . whose notes were littered with spelling and grammar errors, had . transcribed messages from friends pleading for the schoolgirl to get in . touch. Another entry included debit card details the police had used to top up the missing girl’s phone to ensure she could call if necessary. Reporters from the News of the World seized on a message mistakenly left by a recruitment agency asking if a woman named Mandy wanted to come for a job interview. But it later emerged the message had been left in error and was not meant for the missing 13-year-old.

Others have been criticised for the way they speak, their clothes and their nervous habits.

ITV Studios, which produces the quiz . for the BBC, yesterday admitted contestants were routinely given a . number to call if they needed ‘advice and support’ over abuse. Among those targeted is Marine Debray, 20, who represented Balliol College, Oxford, last year. ‘People generally thought I was a . stupid blonde and made sexual comments,’ said Miss Debray, who read . English and Modern Languages. ‘There was a guy who made a photo album of me intercut with photos of male genitalia.

But now an even raunchier side to the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Doris Lessing can be revealed. In a secret version of a memoir by the late political commentator Anthony Sampson, he described in detail how he was seduced by Lessing, who died last weekend aged 94. Relationship: Anthony Sampson, often described as a ‘reserved Englishman’, wrote that  Doris Lessing brought ‘a passionate African freshness to both politics and sex’ Sampson, often described as a ‘reserved . Englishman’, wrote that Lessing brought ‘a passionate African freshness . to both politics and sex’. And in his recollections, seen by The Mail on Sunday, he recounted how she pretended to visit him for research purposes as a guise to take him to bed. Sampson’s tribute to his lover, who arrived in Britain from Rhodesia in 1949 when she was 30, was removed from the version of the book that his widow Sally published in 2008, four years after his death. But in the unedited version, he wrote: ‘Doris Lessing, the communist novelist, had arrived from Rhodesia like a magnificent panther from the veldt, leaping across walls and fences, with a mixture of beauty and directness. ‘Soon after I met her she rang up to ask to look through my copies of the South African newspaper New Age. ‘Later I took her to see a John Osborne play and we came back for cold chicken at my flat. Travel: Doris Lessing, pictured in the 1950s, arrived in Britain from Rhodesia in 1949 when she was 30 . ‘ “I like the way we go through the preliminaries,” said Doris, “when both of us know we’re going to sleep together tonight. I’ve already tried twice. Why should I have wanted to look up New Age?” ‘Doris brought a passionate African freshness to both politics and sex.  “Who organised that strike,” she asked breathlessly  in the midst of love- making, “the students  or the workers?” ’ In the published version of  Sampson’s memoirs, titled The Anatomist, there is no reference to their sexual relationship, though Lessing is still described as a ‘magnificent panther from the veldt’ and the book includes the reference to the play and the cold chicken meal. Sampson does not provide a date for the sexual encounter in the unedited version but it is clear it occurred before his marriage to Sally in 1965. What is uncertain is whether it was a one-night stand. Passed away: British author Doris Lessing, pictured with her Nobel Prize in Literature in 2007, died last week at the age of 94 . Lessing, who published her first book The Grass Is Singing in 1950, was  without doubt an established author when the affair took place. She wrote some of the most acclaimed novels of the post-war period, including the Children Of Violence series, The Golden Notebook and The  Good Terrorist. She does not mention Sampson in her memoirs, but never named her lovers when writing of her affairs. Two drafts of the unpublished version of Sampson’s memoirs were donated to the Bodleian Library in Oxford by his widow Sally in 2011. Other documents reveal that the reference to the fling with Lessing was still in drafts of the book dated 2005. In her foreword to his edited book, Sampson’s widow acknowledged that although he had written all of the chapters  himself, she had revised sections. But she denied editing out the passage about Lessing and declined to comment further.","Political commentator said the author brought passion to 'politics and sex'

A 49-year-old man who exposed himself on a plane after rubbing burning 'peppermint oil' on his penis was cleared of indecent exposure yesterday. A judge ruled there was insufficient proof that Utah's Stuart Ronald Clarke meant to break the law when he publicly played with his privates in November. The FBI's Terrorism Taskforce began investigating Clarke after a woman who saw him  'holding his exposed penis in his right hand' during a Delta flight reported him to police. Out there: Stuart Ronald Clarke, 49 (not pictured) was on a Delta Air Lines . flight from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Salt Lake City, Utah when he . exposed his penis . The woman also told a flight attendant after confronting Clarke. The embarrassed man fled the Salt Lake City International Airport, leaving his bags behind, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Two days later, police questioned Clarke at his Provo home after seizing his luggage. Clarke told police that he had a headache in Amsterdam, where the first leg of his trip originated. To ease the pain, he rubbed what he called 'peppermint oil' on his forehead. After landing in Minneapolis about eight hours later, Clarke boarded a second plane - this one going to Salt Lake City. During the flight, he went to the bathroom, telling police he 'obviously touched [his] privates'. He indicated that's when he inadvertently transferred the oil to his privates 'because he felt burning afterward.' When he returned to his seat, he placed . his coat over himself to 'keep warm' and began 'scratching and . adjusting' his groin area because of his discomfort. Airport police were unable to locate Clarke after the incident because he left the airport without even stopping to pick up his checked bag, according to a search warrant . He was sitting in a middle seat between two women. When an officer asked why he didn't use the bathroom to relieve himself, he stated that it 'would not have made it better' because 'water makes it worse.' Clarke said he then unbuttoned his pants, stuffed his right hand into his underwear and pulled out his penis. A police search of Clarke's luggage turned up a random mix of food and candies as well as two small boxes labeled 'Olbas Oil.' One box stated the oil was an inhalant and decongestant, while the other said it could be used as a pain reliever when applied directly to the skin. Officers who opened the boxes reported the oil smelled of eucalyptus and mint. Clarke was charged in a federal court in April with lewd, indecent or obscene behavior on an aircraft, a class C misdemeanor.","Utah's Stuart Ronald Clarke, 49, cleared of indecent exposure yesterday .

Warning: Rising stars in the party will warn the chancellor to look out for those on middle incomes . An influential group of  Conservative MPs will today call for stamp duty to be scrapped on all homes worth less than £500,000. The change would be included as part of a package of tax cuts to help Britain’s middle classes. The Free Enterprise Group will warn George Osborne that he needs to do much more to help those on middle incomes who have faced a severe financial squeeze during the recession. Proposals are expected to include the scrapping of stamp duty on most homes and a big rise in the threshold at which people start to pay income tax at the higher rate of 40 per cent. The group – which contains a number of the party’s rising stars – will also call for business rates to be cut to help save the embattled high street and provide a boost to small businesses. It will argue that the UK has the highest property taxes in the world, and that scrapping stamp duty on properties worth less than £500,000 would help first-time buyers much more than any other measure. Some 94 per cent of the homes sold in England now attract stamp duty. Buyers of properties worth more than £250,000 pay three per cent duty on the total price. But if the threshold had been increased in line with inflation it would now stand at more than £1.2million. Today’s report is also expected to call for the 40 per cent income tax threshold to be raised from £41,450 to £50,000 to ease pressure on buyers, particularly those in London and the South East where property prices are higher. Proposals: The influential group will propose a number of measures that will ease the strain on first-time buyers . The group’s recommendations will be passed to the Chancellor ahead of his autumn statement on the economy next month. Mr . Osborne is also reported to be mulling calls from within the party to . go beyond his fuel duty freeze and cut taxes at the petrol pumps. Many Tories are concerned that the recent revival in Britain’s economic fortunes is not yet being felt by traditional Tory voters. The intervention from the Free Enterprise Group comes as the Liberal Democrats pile pressure on the Chancellor to set aside £1billion a year to help the low paid by raising the personal tax allowance. The basic rate threshold is already due to rise to £10,000 next year – up from £6,475 at the last election. And Nick Clegg yesterday said he wanted to see the Government go further by raising the threshold to £10,500 before the election. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that  raising the personal allowance would be worth £100 a year to 24million ordinary taxpayers and take about half a million people out of income tax altogether. ‘As the recovery is finally taking hold I think it is very important that as many people as possible feel that they are benefiting from it,’ he said. ‘That’s why I call it a workers’ bonus.’ And he said the increase could be funded by a levy – such as a ‘mansion tax’ – on the ‘super wealthy’. But the Conservatives are opposed to the plans for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2 million, and Mr Clegg acknowledged he had not yet got agreement within the Coalition for his tax plan. In a further move to distance himself from the Tories, Mr Clegg rejected David Cameron’s call in his Guildhall speech last week for a ‘permanently’ smaller state sector. He said: ‘You appear to have this view from the right now that taxes should never go up and that in a sense you should be shrinking the state to ever smaller size in a slightly ideological way. 'I don’t think we should be ideological about this.’","Free Enterprise Group will warn Osborne to help those on middle incomes .

The country’s biggest energy firm will today hit millions with an inflation-busting hike in prices. Nearly 8million British Gas customers face a 10.4 per cent rise in electricity prices and an 8.4 per cent increase in gas rates. The increase, which comes as temperatures across the UK are set to drop to almost zero, will add £131 to the average family’s fuel bill, pushing it to an eye-watering £1,444 a year. Inflation-busting: The increase will add £131 to the average family's fuel bill, pushing it to an eye-watering £1,444 a year . A week ago, another of Britain’s Big Six suppliers, SSE, raised prices by 8.2 per cent  on average, affecting around 7.3million customers. Five of the major providers have so far announced higher than inflation price rises, which will have an impact on almost every household in Britain. The remaining increases will take effect in December and January, the coldest months of the year. Only German-owned E.ON has yet to announce a rise – but it has warned tariff hikes are ‘increasingly likely’. Cap: Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze bills after the next election if Labour win power . An estimated 24,000 people die every winter from the cold, with the elderly particularly at risk. More than 6million fear they will not be able to heat their homes, according to data from charity Age UK. Adam Scorer, of consumer watchdog Consumer Futures, said: ‘Millions of households will go into winter genuinely afraid of the costs of keeping warm. Fuel poverty is already close to epidemic proportions and it is set to become even more commonplace.’ Clare Welton, of campaign group Fuel Poverty Action, said: ‘British Gas’s steep price rises are sure to send a shiver down the spine of millions of their hard-up customers, particularly in the knowledge that Centrica, their parent company, reported £1.58billion operating profits in the six months to June this year. ‘High bills and price rises will force millions of households to choose between heating and eating this winter.’ Tom Lyon, of comparison site uSwitch, said: ‘British Gas  customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed. Adding a further £131 to an already sky-high energy bill will leave many buckling, but the real damage will be to trust.’ EDF gave the lowest increase of 3.9 per cent, still significantly higher than inflation, after pledging not to pass on soaring green levies to customers. British Gas, SSE and npower have all vowed to reduce price hikes if the Government moves the burden of green costs from energy to general taxation. Energy bills, which have consistently risen faster than wages, have climbed the political agenda as more and more families struggle with the cost. Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze bills after the next election if Labour win power. But energy experts warned the move could choke off vital investment in power stations. Britain needs to raise £110billion by the end of the decade to improve ageing infrastructure. Swathes of coal power stations, which are being shut down to comply with EU rules on carbon emissions, must also be replaced. Critics said relying on gas power, the Chancellor’s preferred tactic, will leave the UK more reliant on international gas prices, which are notoriously volatile. Britain has traditionally been sheltered from international power prices because of gas flowing in from the North Sea.","Eight million customers face 10.4% rise in electricity and 8.4% in gas .

A surfer has been killed by a shark off a notorious stretch of Australia's west coast today. The 35-year-old man was surfing off a beach near Gracetown, about 167 miles south of Perth, when he was attacked. Eyewitnesses have told how his arm was missing and there were no signs of life as he was dragged to the shore. Scroll down for video . Scene: The 35-year-old man was surfing off Lefthanders Beach, pictured, near Gracetown, when he was attacked by a shark . The shark is believed to have 'bounced' off the board of another surfer, before launching the fatal strike at 9am. The victim, from Margaret River, was dragged onto Lefthanders Beach after being pulled onto another surfer's board. One of his arms was missing and he was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Sky News. His body was later taken away by helicopter, while his green and yellow surf board was also recovered. Deadly: Gracetown, situated about 167 miles south of Perth, has seen three fatal attacks in the past decade . Speaking today, Sergeant Craig Anderson said: ‘His injuries appear to be consistent with those that would be received in a shark attack.' Stuart Smith, the Fisheries Department's director general, immediately closed beaches in the area. He has issued an 'imminent threat' order for the shark to be captured - but insists he will not be putting out a ‘shoot to kill’ command. A . fisheries vessel with a hook and lines is currently scouring the water, while . urgent warnings have been issued to locals to stay . out of the water. ‘The area is considered a high risk and hazard region because of the high number of swimmers and surfers there,’ said Mr Smith. He added that he was particularly concerned about the large number of school leavers who are currently on holiday in the area. Killer: No details of the type of shark responsible for the latest attack have been released. However, great whites, pictured, are often to blame for fatalities off Australia's west coast . As news of the attack spread, crowds began to gather at the beach. They were later joined by the surfer's devastated relatives. Australia has become the world's deadliest country for shark attacks. Experts say the creatures often attack surfboards and their riders because they believed the shape resembles seals, one of their prey. Gracetown - the state's top surfing and wine-making region - alone has seen three fatal shark attacks in the past decade. Yesterday, the girlfriend of 24-year-old Ben Lendin, who was killed by a shark in West Australia . last year, posted a message on Facebook paying tribute to the latest victim.

A Boston woman is furious after she claims her dog and cat were nearly killed during a cross-country United Airlines flight after baggage handlers left the animals in their crates for more than 12 hours - including more than an hour spent outside on the tarmac in 94-degree heat. Adding insult to injury, Janet Sinclair claims, is the fact that the airline only agreed to pay for the animals' veterinary bills if she signed a non-disclosure agreement promising not to discuss the incident with the media. Sinclair, however, didn't sign the agreement, and has since told her story to several news outlets, as well as creating a Facebook page titled 'United Airlines Almost Killed My Greyhound.' Near death: When Sedona the greyhound got off a United Airlines flight, she was nearly dead from heat stroke and other ailments . Tough kitty: Janet Sinclair's cat, Alika, spent close to an hour on the tarmac in Houston in 94-degree heat . Speaking out: United offered Sinclair money to pay her veterinary bills as long as she agreed not to publicly discuss the incident . In July, Sinclair was moving from San Diego to Boston and decided to use United Airlines' 'PetSafe' program to transport her cat, Alika and her greyhound, Sedona. Sinclair opted to go with the 'PetSafe' program because it promises that pets will receive personal handling in climate controlled vans and that they 'never will be exposed to temperatures greater than 85 degrees for more than 45 minutes.' 'They assured me that my animals would get a safety stop – a comfort stop – in Houston that I paid extra for,' Sinclair told NBC Bay Area. That, however, didn't happen. 'PetSafe': Sinclair paid extra to make sure her pets were taken care of, but they were left on a hot tarmac for nearly an hour . Evidence: Sinclair recorded the poor treatment her animals received on her cellphone . According to Sinclair, she watched as the plane waited on the runway at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and saw a cargo employee kick Sedona's crate at least six times in an attempt to shove it under the shade of the wing of the plane. That's when Sinclair pulled out her phone and started recording how cargo workers were treating her animals. The video Sinclair shot shows the animals being left out on the tarmac for nearly an hour. By the time the plane touched down in Boston, Sinclair says Sedona was on the verge of death. 'Sedona’s entire crate was filled with blood, feces, urine,' Sinclair . said. 'Sedona was in full heat stroke. All of the blankets were filled . with blood. She was urinating and defecating blood. She was dying, . literally, right in front of me.' Heat stroke: When they landed, Sedona's cage was covered in blood, urine and feces . Sick: When the plane landed, Sedona was near death, suffering from heat stroke and other injuries . Non-disclosure: Sinclair declined to sign a non-disclosure agreement so she could alert the public about her experience . Sedona then spent three days in intensive care being treated for heat stroke. Despite the fact that a veterinarian had given both animals a clean bill of health prior to the flight, United Airlines claims the dog's injuries were the result of a pre-existing condition. However, the doctor who treated the greyhound wrote in his report that 'We have no reason to believe that these medical problems were due to . underlying disease, and we believe that these medical problems were . secondary to hyperthermia that she suffered during her United Airlines . flight.' The airline offered to pay for the dog's treatment, but only if Sinclair signed the agreement promising that she would not publicly discuss the incident. She declined. United Airlines has declined comment about the incident, but offered a written statement saying 'We are committed to ensuring safe and comfortable travel of all the pets . that fly with us and regret that Sedona did not have a good experience. We offered to compensate Ms. Sinclair by fully reimbursing her vet . bill, but unfortunately she declined to accept the terms of the . agreement.' Sinclair says that making the public aware of the incident that nearly killed her dog is worth more than being reimbursed. 'I still want to be reimbursed,' she said. 'But I’m not going to be quiet.'","Janet Sinclair's dog nearly died from heatstroke after United Airlines left the dog in 94-degree heat .

'Shame': Glenda Hull 'could not live with the shame' after being sexually assaulted, brother Roy claims . A young bride-to-be was driven to suicide after being sexually assaulted by a BBC presenter she idolised, her brother claims. Glenda Hull, 21, died in 1971 when she jumped off a 29-storey building 'completely out of the blue'. It was just weeks after she went to see the BBC star at a conference in Manchester - before going for drinks and accepting a lift home, when she was assaulted in a car. Last night, her brother, Roy Hull, 57, appealed for witnesses to confirm his suspicion about the presenter who is still alive. He claims his sister could not live with the shame following her attack on a high road in the Peak District. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'As a family we have always been concerned that this man was responsible for abusing my sister – an act which led to her taking her life. Now we just want to know the truth.' 'After certain stars were arrested and convicted I realised that a similar thing could have happened to my sister. 'My sister had no reason to kill herself and was happy with life.' Ms Hull, who worked in the General Post Office in Manchester, had been talking about the star's event for weeks before, Mr Hull claims. After the talk, she went for a drink with friends and the presenter, who had a home in the area. He says that at the end of the week she went out with the same group then accepted a lift home from an unnamed man, who took her to Snake Pass, an isolated high road on the A57 in the Peak District. Rushing home hysterical, she told her family he 'threatened to leave her there' if she did not perform lewd sexual acts. Mr Hull is certain she confirmed his suspicion when he mentioned the star's name and she 'snapped', telling him never to mention it again. He said: 'She was very aggressive and angry. 'There was clearly something there but I was simply disappointed. 'Mum and Dad tried to get it out of her but she would never divulge anything.' Police reports say she was approached a few weeks later at work by a woman in a red cardigan. Ms Hull looked visibly upset, went to the top of the building, and jumped off. Mr Hull is convinced this woman has a connection with the BBC presenter. The Hull family is now working with high profile abuse lawyer Alan Collins from Pannone Solicitors, whose previous work involves Jimmy Savile cases. Probe: The Hull family has enlisted the help of lawyer Alan Collins, who represented Jimmy Savile victims . Mr Collins told MailOnline: 'One is hopeful that people's memories will be jogged. People may have known Glenda and think ""well, what I know is inconsequential"", but that may not be the case. This is about piecing together a puzzle, every bit of information is needed. 'This is a very distressing situation where a family have lived for years without knowing the full circumstances of their loved one's death. 'For us to help Glenda's brother, Roy Hull, we need to speak to anyone who might have seen or spoken to Glenda around the time of her suicide, especially anyone she spoke to about her meeting with a showbiz personality weeks before her death. 'We are certainly not accusing anyone of anything but there are questions that need answering to establish the truth about this poor young woman's death.' A BBC spokesman said: 'We do not comment on individual criminal allegations. We urge anyone who has been the victim of an offence to go to the police.'","Glenda Hull, 21, jumped off a building after she was abused in a car in 1971 .

Stores are giving as little as 6.7 per cent of the price of charity Christmas cards to good causes. A Which? Money survey of 15 chains found Asda was the least generous retailer, while rivals Sainsbury’s and Waitrose both gave ten per cent of the profits made to charity. Their small donation compares meagerly to buying Christmas cards from charities directly, with most ensuring all funds go to the organisation. A market research survey has found supermarkets have been giving as little as six per cent of Christmas charity card profits to good causes . Asda sold packs of charity cards for £3, of which just 20p was donated to charity – working out at only 6.7 per cent of the selling price, the survey found. Marie Curie Cancer Care however sold cards at £3.99 a pack, with only £1 of the retail price going towards the cost of production. Oxfam said that for every Christmas card sold, 44p of every £1 went directly back into the charity. Researchers polled a number of online and in store retailers in the survey. A Which? spokeswoman said: 'Consumers may want to check how much will be donated if they’re buying charity Christmas cards because our research shows this can vary widely.' WH Smith did sell one pack of cards that had 100 per cent of the selling price going to charity and another set that had a 20 per cent donation. Debenhams sold one pack of cards where 100 per cent of the profits from the cards went to charity, but excluded VAT. It also excluded VAT from the 20 per cent of the selling price it donated on its other charity cards. Waitrose sold a set of cards that donated 100 per cent including VAT, while Boots gave 10 per cent on its 'standard' charity cards and 20 per cent on its Children in Need cards, including VAT. The most generous retailer across its full range of Christmas cards, by size of donation, was John Lewis. It gave 25 per cent of the selling price on all its own-brand cards.","Asda revealed as least generous retailer giving just 6.7 per cent to charity .

A ‘Pierce Brosnan gene’ which causes people to develop freckles, brown hair and blue eyes has been discovered by scientists. A study of 2,230 people in Iceland identified a gene variant that is strongly related to sensitivity to the sun, brown hair, blue eyes, and freckles. Normally, the further from the equator people come from, the less pigmentation they have in their skin, hair and eyes. A 'Pierce Brosnan gene' which causes people to develop freckles, brown hair and blue eyes has been discovered by scientists . This makes them more sensitive to the sun, but means they can more easily absorb sunlight to generate vitamin D3, a nutrient important for healthy bones. The study looked at a particular variant in the gene IRF4 which is part of the immune system and produces a protein that helps to fight off viruses and harmful bacteria. IRF4 appears to act like a 'dimmer switch' regulating the amount of melanin in surface skin cells, called keratinocytes, which protect us from the UV light which causes sunburn. They discovered a variant of IRF4 can reduce the amount of melanin getting to the keratinocytes resulting in freckles, but they still haven't found the exact cause, according to the study published in the journal Cell. Dr Dan Kastner, Scientific Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, in Bethesda near Washington, said: ‘Genes involved in skin pigmentation also have important roles in human health and disease. ‘This study explains a complex molecular pathway that may also contribute insights into skin diseases, such as melanoma, which is caused by the interaction of genetic susceptibility with environmental factors.’ The gene makes people sensitive to the sun. Mr Brosnan is pictured looking as though he has been in the sun . The findings could provide insights into skin diseases, such as melanoma. Lindsay Lohan (pictured) could also have the gene variant . Dr William Pavan, co-author and senior investigator at the Genetic Disease Research Branch said: ‘Genome-wide association studies are uncovering many genomic variants that are associated with human traits and most of them are found in non-protein-coding regions of the genome. ‘Exploring the biological pathways and molecular mechanisms that involve variants in these under-explored portions of the genome is a challenging part of our work. ‘This is one of a few cases where scientists have been able to associate a variant in a non-coding genomic region with a functional mechanism.’","Study looked at variant in gene IRF4 which is part of the immune system .

Ten thousand starlings fluttered above electricity pylons in the Scottish borders yesterday evening as the endangered birds begin to flock together for winter. The swarm of endangered creatures flapped around the site in Rigg near Gretna, Dumfriesshire, for around 20 minutes before taking off into the night. Photographer Owen Humphreys captured their frantic flight, having waited weeks for the birds to appear in a flock as big. Scroll down for video . A flock of around ten thousand noisy starlings fluttered above electricity pylons yesterday in Rigg, Dumfriesshire in the Scottish Borders . Owen Humphreys was on hand to capture the birds as they flew in formation, creating weird and wonderful shapes in the dusk sky . The photographer said those who were lucky enough to witness the spectacle could 'see in them what they like' as the birds dipped and dived into a variety of shapes . 'The shapes they formed were spectacular, making a gorilla, two dolphins and maybe even a giant bird,' he said. 'People can see in them what they like. There was also a real bird of prey, probably a buzzard, which seemed to make the starlings fly even more. 'As well as the visual sight, the noise of them flying was remarkable.' He added: 'I’ve been going to the site for three weeks to get the right photo. Last night made it all worth it.' Chris Collett, a spokesman for the RSPB, said: 'There are several theories as to why starlings gather in this way. 'Some say it’s for fun, or for communication, but the most likely reason is for survival, the theory being that the sheer number of birds will confuse a bird of prey.' The weight of the flock on electricity wires caused minor power cuts in the rural village near Gretna which has a population of around 2,000. The weight of the birds perching on electricity lines caused some minor power cuts in the village of Rigg which is near Gretna in Dumfriesshire . Though the starling remains one of the birds most commonly seen in gardens, its decline elsewhere is of concern to the RSPB, the country's largest nature conservation charity . It is not known exactly why the creatures swarm in such large numbers though many tend to migrate to the UK from harsher climates in search of milder winter conditions . A larger bird of prey was seen flying among the smaller creatures whose flight is quick and direct, but which also run speedily along the ground . The birds are considered a high priority by the country's largest nature conservation charity who describes them as 'small and gregarious.' Though they remain some of the most commonly seen garden birds, their presence elsewhere is of concern. Starlings typically migrate to the UK in winter in search of a mild climate.

The boss of a crisis-hit hospital says she fears it is in a ‘downward spiral’ and that patients are ‘scared’ to go there after alleged blunders were exposed. A leaked email from Philippa Slinger, chief executive of Wexham Park Hospital, near Slough, reveals she fears there will be a boycott by local GPs frightened to refer patients. And she says that could force her to axe services, with the risk of the hospital’s collapse. The chief executive of Wexham Park Hospital fears GPs will boycott the hospital after alleged blunders were exposed . The warning comes after The Mail on Sunday published details two weeks ago of a secret official report into claims that blunders at Wexham Park have been covered up for 14 years. A whistleblower heard by the InPractice investigation into Wexham, which serves half a million people in the Thames Valley, said that up to 50 patients may have died needlessly. Chief executive Philippa Slinger expressed concerns the hospital would be boycotted by local GPs in wake of scandal . In the email sent last week, Ms Slinger says the disclosures have made patients ‘scared to come here’. She adds: ‘We can all imagine how anxious relatives might be as they know the ambulance is bringing their loved one to us. ‘Local GPs and referrers will start to be very worried about us and the quality of medical staff. How much longer will they continue to refer? If they stop, we will have to trim back departments and services.’ The crisis has been fuelled by a dispute among doctors – 24 ethnic minority consultants wrote to the Care Quality Commission health watchdog to claim there had been ‘harassment’ over blunders, and that their white colleagues were let off. That conflict escalated last night after another leaked email from the head of surgery, Dr Emmanuel Umerah, claimed the protest had been signed by ‘every person of colour’ accused of a medical blunder. However, a well-placed source said last night that not all of the seven ethnic minority doctors accused of mistakes had signed the letter.","Chief executive of Wexham Park Hospital fears there will be a boycott by local GP's .

The plight of the two lovers' has gripped audiences in deeply conservative Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Huda has defied both the wishes of her family, who said she could not marry Tahar,  and also dared to flee the country and follow him to Yemen. In court, she refused to accept a lawyer provided by the Saudi embassy, fearing pressure to return home. But Huda did accept to be represented by a lawyer appointed by a Yemeni non-government organisation called Hood, who said he hoped for a favourable outcome. 'This is a humanitarian case, and must not raise tensions between the two countries,' lawyer Abdel Rakib al-Qadi told AFP.

He indicated that Sanaa had come under pressure from the Saudi authorities to ensure Huda's return. She is currently under arrest and on trial for illegal entry. If found guilty, she faces expulsion. No decision was announced on Sunday, and the court set the next hearing for December 1 as it awaited a UN High Commissioner for Refugees ruling on a request for asylum. A UNHCR representative confirmed to AFP that Huda had initiated proceedings to be granted refugee status in Yemen. If she succeeds, it will be difficult for the authorities in Yemen to expel her.

Farshad Hashemzadeh, 28, was left so distressed by the unwanted appendage, he attempted to slice it off himself after being denied surgery by the NHS. The car parts salesman, who has since had it removed privately, told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that he was left desperately unhappy after surgery was repeatedly refused. Scroll down for video . Traumatised: Farshad Hashemzadeh appeared on This Morning to discuss his feelings about growing a breast . As it was: Farshad Hashemzadeh was so distressed by his unwanted breast, he tried to slice it off himself . 'I went to the GP and started using tablets,' he revealed of early attempts to get rid of the breast which began growing shortly after he turned 18. 'It got rid it for two months but it started growing back. It wasn't that hard when I was 18 but [by the age of] 25, I really started suffering because I couldn't have a relationship. 'In the summer I would put two or three vests on and try to hide it with my hand.' Farshad's condition, although rare, is not unique with around 400 men diagnosed with gynaecomastia each year. The condition, which is caused by a hormone imbalance, is more commonly found in the over-50s but rarely manifests in such an extreme way. 'It's surprisingly common, particularly . with men over 50,' added This Morning's resident GP, Dr Jonty Heaversedge. Difficulties: Farshad and his girlfriend Charlene had to raise £3000 for a private operation after the NHS refused . 'Often it arises in adolescence and it can also be a . complication of medication - 20 percent of those who get gynaecomastia, get it as side . effect.' Although the NHS will look at funding surgery for people suffering from similar conditions, Farshad, despite his continuing distress, was repeatedly refused surgery. 'Most people do hide it,' added Dr Heaversedge, 'but you can't underestimate the effect on people's self-confidence and their relationships.' In Farshad's case, his anger and upset eventually resulted in a dramatic attempt to cut the breast away himself. 'I was very angry by the decision of the NHS and I couldn't see any way out,' he told the Sun newspaper. Common: According to Dr Jonty Heaversedge, the condition tends to arise in men over the age of 50 . Healing: Farshad's breast following the operation to remove it. He hopes it won't grow back . 'I was too embarrassed to take my top off in front of my girlfriend so I tried to cut it away. 'It was painful and there was blood all over the floor.

A senior judge last week used a sentencing speech to warn that the justice system is being ‘destroyed’ by cuts to barristers’ fees. In a rare case of a member of the judiciary using court time to raise a political issue, Judge Andrew Woolman declared there would be miscarriages of justice as a result of the cuts as he jailed former Army corporal Peter Clarke for 16 years for firearms and drugs offences at Preston Crown Court on Thursday. Judge Woolman’s comments are among the strongest by a member of the judiciary on the Government’s latest drive to slash £220 million from the criminal legal aid budget. Preston Crown Court: Judge Andrew Woolman warned that the justice system is being 'destroyed' by cuts to barristers' fees . Judge Woolman claimed all judges are worried about the ‘erosion’ of the criminal bar, which will make their own job ‘difficult if not impossible’. Judge Andrew Woolman broke with tradition by using court time to express a political view . Under the plans, criminal barristers will see their daily fees in standard cases cut by more than 10 per cent while those representing defendants in the most complex, long-running trials will lose 30 per cent. Ministers have highlighted some ‘fat cat’ QCs who receive £500,000 a year in public money. But critics say the majority of criminal barristers earn less than school teachers and will be forced out of the profession by the shake-up. Judge Woolman said: ‘People of ability are leaving or transferring to other fields of work, and new recruits are choosing either not to come to the bar at all, or not to the criminal bar at any rate. ‘Valuable skills are being lost, and will continue to be lost, and once lost cannot easily be regained. Last month, Britain’s top judge, Supreme Court President Lord Neuberger, criticised separate restrictions on cases that qualify for legal aid. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘At around £2 billion a year our legal aid system is one of the most expensive in the world, and we have no choice but to make savings.’","It is rare for judges to use court time to express political views .

A U.S company has created a personal robotic bartender that it claims 'serves the perfect drink' to suit an individual's tastes. Monsieur is an artificially intelligent robotic that can learn its user's favourite cocktails as well as how strong they like them - and even anticipate when to include a double shot of alcohol if they have had an especially trying day at work. The robot is the brainchild of a company, also called Monsieur, in Atlanta, Georgia, which is trying to raise $100,000 on crowd-funding website Kickstarter to put the product, which is designed for the home, into production. The artificially intelligent robot called Monsieur, can create thousands of drinks at the touch of a button and learns how a user likes them - even anticipating when to make a drink with a double shot of alcohol in it after a long day at work . To use the machine, which the company envisions being installed in a house, an individual must use the touch screen on the robot to browse the 300-strong cocktail list and choose how strong they could like their drink, from 'lightweight' to 'boss'. Over time, the company says its intelligent machine will learn an individual's taste to automatically per-adjust their drinks, as well as making them to order. The firm also says that just like a skilled human bartender, its robot can make recommendations based on their preferences and homeowners can pick a theme for their machine from Irish pub to Hawaiian tiki bar. To use the machine, a user must use the touch screen on the robot to browse through the 300-strong cocktail list and choose how strong they could like their drink, from 'lightweight' to 'boss' Each of the 12 themes comprises 25 cocktails and Monsieur claims to be able to make 150 drinks without needing to top up on booze. However, when the ingredients do run out, the robot can send an email or text message to a local store to order more. Using its 'personal butler feature' the robot can tap into a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection to know when its owner is at home. The robot is the brainchild of a company, also called Monsieur, in Atlanta, Georgia, which is trying to raise $100,000 on crowd-funding website Kickstarter to put the product, which is designed for the home, into production . If they have a date scheduled, it can offer the man or woman a matching cocktail, or even mix a chosen celebratory tipple if its owner's favourite sports team wins a fixture. Owners of the bar-meets-bartender can use a smartphone app to order a drink remotely so it is ready when they get home, or if they don't want to move from the sofa. The company wrote on its Kickstarter page: 'We envision a world where Monsieurs are . in nightclubs, arena suites, hotels and offices and many other places . where you enjoy cocktails and they will recognise who you are and your . preferences via your mobile app.' The firm says that just like a skilled human bartender, its robot can make smart recommendations based on their preferences and homeowners can pick a theme for their machine from Irish pub to Hawaiian tiki bar . At the time of writing, Monsieur has raised $70,500 of its $100,000 target on Kickstarter, but so far no businesses have snapped up a $10,000 package for three machines plus extras to make them one of the first establishments to have the robotic barman. The company already has an industrial-scale machine that serves drinks ina  number of bars in Atlanta.

Family chats are becoming a thing of the past as the majority of parents now communicate regularly with their children through social network sites, according to a new report out today. A staggering seven in ten parents have admitted to now using social sites such as Facebook and Twitter as a regular channel of communication in their family. And more than one in ten admit they didn’t have meaningful chats in person with their children at all throughout a typical week. Tech family: A staggering seven in ten parents have admitted to now using social sites such as Facebook and Twitter as a regular channel of communication in their familyis . It has been revealed that the average Brit has just six face-to-face conversations with others in their family each week – that's less than one a day. Instead, we send five emails on an . average week, post on walls three times a week and comment on photos . twice a week via social networking sites. Furthermore, over a third of parents claim to rely heavily on other social websites such as Pinterest and Instagram to really understand what makes their child tick. An overwhelming 62 per cent of those parents quizzed revealed that they checked what their children were 'liking' or 'wanting to be seen in' at least once a day. 80 per cent of those parents who keep an eye on things that their child has shown an interest in online - whether it’s a hobby or an item of clothing or a place to go to - say it has significantly helped their relationship with their child. However, nearly all (98 per cent) admitted to not really wanting to be 'friends' with or 'followers' of their children, but felt that they needed to as this was the only way they would get the quickest response. Prying eyes: Over a third of parents claim to rely heavily on other social websites such as Pinterest and Instagram to really understand what makes their child tick . Andrew Hewitt, co-founder of Iam150/, who carried out the research, said: 'It’s definitely a sign of the times that parents are using social tools as the main way to communicate with and understand their children. 'Who would have thought ten years ago that the web would play such a big part in a family’s everyday life? 'Our research clearly shows that it’s these technically adept parents who are the smart ones as they’ve realised that children can hide the majority of content in their Facebook feed from them so their “friendship” with their child can be meaningless. 'Instead they have turned to things like Pinterest to understand what their children are really about.' Professor Karen Pine, Psychologist at University of Hertfordshire added: 'As children develop and are able to spend more time away from their parents it leaves mothers and fathers ignorant of what their children are doing, and also feeling they know them less well. 'This survey reminds us that it is vital that parents keep up with technology and become familiar with the social tools used by the younger generation. This way the tech savvy parents will be better able to keep tabs on their children. 'By being able to see what their child likes and dislikes online they may also gain better insight into their child's behaviour. This will not only enhance the parent-child relationship but may also help ensure child safety on-line. 'Although face-to-face communication is important for healthy family functioning, we also all have to accept that we live in a digital age and need to adapt to new ways of interacting.'

The daily commute to work will be consigned to history by superfast broadband making it easier to work from home, minsters claim. High speed web access at home will dramatically cut business travel, save millions on travel costs and give everyone more free time. The majority of people will work from home several days every month, a major government study predicts. The future? Most people will work from home several days every month once superfast broadband is rolled out, the government claims . Increasing internet speeds will save British households a total of £270 million and 60 million hours of leisure time each year by 2024, the new report predicts. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said as well as bringing economic benefits, it will also have a ‘positive impact on the way we live’. It is claimed that better connectivity would help more people save cash by avoiding commuting and cut annual business travel by 3.3 billion miles (5.3 billion km) a year - around 9 per cent of the current annual UK total. The report states: ‘As levels of connectivity at home improve, this will tend to encourage higher levels of working from home – the majority of which will be people working a few days per month from home, rather than teleworking full-time.’ The study estimates that about 60 million hours of leisure time will be saved through increased teleworking . It also predicts that it will make it easier for older people, carers and the disabled to take up some part-time work from home. ‘The prevalence of this will increase as levels of home connectivity improve over time.’ The report estimates that the increase in teleworking made possible by faster broadband will save about 60 million hours of leisure time per year in the UK by 2024. ‘By avoiding commuting costs, the additional teleworking enabled by faster broadband will lead to total household savings rising to £270 million per annum by 2024.’ It adds: ‘The underlying hypothesis for our model is that speed matters: faster broadband will enable businesses and individuals to change the way they do things.’ By 2024 faster broadband could cut the UK¿s annual commuting distance by 2.3 billion km, predominantly through less car usage . The findings are contained in the UK Broadband Impact Study Impact Report, by analysts SQW with Cambridge Econometrics. British Telecom has secured several contracts to deliver access to super-fast broadband connections to 90% of the UK by 2015, in line with Government targets. Mrs Miller said: ‘What this report shows us is that, as well as super-fast broadband being good for economic growth, it will make even more of a positive impact on the way we live, helping us work more productively and get online faster. ‘Our broadband roll-out is one of the best in Europe, with almost three-quarters of the UK able to access super-fast speeds. This is making a real difference to people in communities across the UK from small businesses able to expand, schoolchildren being able to log on to do their homework or people being able to work from home. ‘This investment in technology is vital for our future and will help Britain continue to compete in the global race and improve the way we live and work.’ Mrs Miller is due to take part in a Twitter Q&A from 4.45pm on Monday on high speed broadband using the hashtag #askdcms. People working from home would save £350million on commuter costs, but would spend £80million more on heating their homes for work . The Commons spending watchdog - the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) - last month raised concerns that consumers were not benefiting from healthy competition in this project, adding BT had all of the 26 contracts let by June 2013 and was expected to secure the remaining 18. Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant repeated claims in the House of Commons this month that BT had been given a ‘bung’ by the Government, making it almost impossible for other operators to compete to provide broadband in semi-rural areas. The suggestion was denied by the Government.","Faster internet access will make working from home easier .

The model of helicopter that crashed on Friday was grounded last year amid safety concerns. Safety regulators issued an emergency alert over the Eurocopter EC135 after a fault was found on an aircraft used by the Scottish Ambulance Service. The helicopter had been found to have a crack on a rotor blade – a problem which experts said could cause it to crash. It led to air ambulance operators across the UK grounding helicopters as a ‘precautionary measure’, although they were later cleared to fly. Grounded: Safety regulators issued an emergency alert over the Eurocepter EC135 after a fault was found during a routine inspection . The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) also ordered a worldwide inspection of all 1,000 helicopters of the same model – which would have included the seven-year-old aircraft that crashed on Friday. EASA’s report said an investigation had found problems with deformed safety pins which ‘if not detected and corrected, could lead to further crack propagation, possibly resulting in main rotor  hub failure and consequent loss of the helicopter’. At the time, Eurocopter said the £2.5 million EC135s had ‘an excellent safety record’. Police Scotland’s aircraft – its only helicopter – was a later T2 version of the original EC135.

A Swedish department store has sparked a fresh body image debate after pictures of its 'normal sized' mannequins appeared on social networking sites. Åhléns, the Swedish equivalent of John Lewis, introduced the new-look mannequins to all of its 76 stores back in 2010 - to widespread acclaim from customers - but a picture originally posted by blogger Rebecka Silvekroon garnered fresh interest this week after appearing on a Facebook page claiming to be shot in a H&M store. The majority of mannequins used in clothing shops, including H&M, have similar proportions to catwalk models and are usually a size 8-10, hence the huge interest in the 'real' sized models. Scroll down for video . Bigger: Åhlens say their use of larger mannequins reflects the differing sizes found among their clientele . H&M denied that the mannequins belonged to them, and the real source of the image was quickly established. but the reaction online has been immense. So popular have the maxi mannequins . proved so far, the picture has gained 'over one million likes and shares', according to Åhléns, and has generated comment from as far afield as the USA. 'Åhléns is using mannequins in different sizes because our customers, mainly women, look different,' explained Åhléns spokesman, Monica Hultgren. 'We're all proud of them because of the positive reaction [from customers] and because it's good to encourage a positive body image.' The fashion industry has come under pressure in recent years, thanks to its use of very skinny shop dummies that don't necessarily reflect the average woman. Most mannequins are around 5ft 10"" tall and a size 10. By contrast, the average British woman is a size 16 and just 5ft 4"" tall. In Sweden, the average height for a woman is 5ft 7"" and most take a size 12. Because of the disparity between the average height and size and that of a mannequin, shop dummies have become a battleground in recent years with health and women's rights charities lining up on one side and the fashion industry on the other. See the difference? A standard shop mannequin (left) and one of Åhlens' bigger ones (right) Slim: Most mannequins reflect the catwalk and are around 5ft 10"" and a size 8 or 10 . 'B-eat has long campaigned for the fashion industry to reflect the diversity of shapes and sizes of mankind and we welcome any initiative that embraces this,' says Mary George, a spokesman for eating disorders charity, B-eat. 'What we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of peoples' different shapes, sizes and build. Although the mannequins in the majority of Britain’s retailers’ windows are a size 10 they are generally taller than the average woman and with the addition of heels create an unrealistically long and lean image. 'These images are unachievable in the main and can provide unhelpful pressure causing women to compare their own bodies unfavourably.' 'Well done to the department store [Åhléns]', said feminist author and founder of Endangered Bodies, Susie Orbach. 'There's too much focus on one image. We all come in different sizes, shapes, colours and heights, and thank goodness for that!' Sophie Bennet, spokesman for women's rights charity, Object, added: 'Women and girls are constantly under pressure to worry about what they look like. 'Advertising, the media, music videos, video games all perpetuate the myth that, for women, to be beautiful is to be young, white or light-skinned, able-bodied and thin, pressurising women to define success by how they look rather than what they have achieved. 'This has a negative impact on women’s self esteem, promoting the idea that women are valued only on the basis of their appearance. 'The introduction of more diverse mannequins would be a positive step forward in challenging sexist representations of women and the sex object culture which promotes them.' Perhaps more pertinent, for the retailers at least, is a report in the Journal of Consumer Research, which looked into the different ways in which women respond to pictures of models. The research found that all women, barring the very underweight, reacted negatively to images of very thin women or mannequins, and their self-esteem suffers as a result. 'Our research confirms that normal females' self-esteem can shift upwards or downwards depending on the model they are exposed to,' explain authors, Dirk Smeesters, Thomas Mussweiler and Naomi Mandel. Changing times: Mannequins used to reflect women like Twiggy. Today, the 6ft tall Erin O'Connor is popular . 'Normal females (with BMIs between 18.5 and 25) have higher levels of self-esteem when exposed to moderately thin models (because they feel similar to these models) and extremely heavy models (because they feel dissimilar to these models). 'However, they have lower levels of self-esteem when exposed to moderately heavy models (because they feel similar) and extremely thin models (because they feel dissimilar).' The research, coupled with B-eat's findings, clearly show that ultra thin mannequins and models can have a negative effect on self-esteem. The big question now is whether or not the UK's shops will follow Åhléns' example. Although Debenhams has trialled size 16 mannequins - which, according to the store, were very well received - and H&M has said it isn't against the idea, hinting at the possibility of using them in future, it remains to be seen whether any others will follow.","Åhléns uses dummies in different shapes including plus sizes .

A strain of the food-poisoning bug MRSA has been found in turkeys being prepared for Christmas on a farm in East Anglia. In a move that will alarm consumers, however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has decided to keep the name of the farm and the retailers it supplies a secret. It said last night there was no need to stop the sale of the turkeys as the risk to consumers was ‘very low’ if the meat was handled carefully and cooked thoroughly. Turkeys on a farm in East Anglia have tested positive for food poisoning bug MRSA but the Government's food and farming department has refused to say which on or who they supply (file picture) Defra said its Animal Health and . Veterinary Laboratories Agency had found Livestock-Associated . Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (LA-MRSA) in poultry during a . routine inspection on the farm in East Anglia. This is not the same form of the bacteria that cause illness in people, and usually clears within 24 hours. Officials . said the most likely reaction if it affected humans would be a skin . rash, similar to eczema, rather than the stomach problems associated . with food-poisoning bugs. Defra said that once the turkeys had been slaughtered and sold, the farm owner would disinfect barns. However, . the fact that the department has decided to keep details of the case . secret – protecting the farming and food industry at the expense of . providing information to consumers – will raise questions about its . priorities. The Government . has been criticised for its handling of the scandal of horsemeat being . sold in beef products earlier this year. So far, not a single meat . producer, supermarket or abattoir has been prosecuted. Government department Defra has decided there is no need to stop the sale of the birds which are destined for Christmas lunches across England . Steve . Wearne, of the Food Standards Agency, said: ‘Any risk of contracting . MRSA through meat from animals with these bacteria is very low when . usual good hygiene and thorough cooking practices are observed. ‘All poultry should be handled hygienically and cooked thoroughly to destroy any bacteria that may be present.’ However, . hundreds of thousands of people in the UK are believed to fall ill . every year because they do not handle and cook poultry with the . necessary care. Professor . Angela Kearns, head of the Staphylococcus Reference Unit at Public . Health England, said: ‘There are many different strains of MRSA that . cause illness in people, but this is not one of the strains that we are . overly concerned about. Defra has decided against naming the farm or its suppliers in a move sure to anger consumers . ‘This . strain is relatively widespread in livestock in Europe, including . countries from which meat is regularly sourced by the UK. There are no . known cases of people contracting MRSA from eating meat.’ Professor . Peter Borriello, of the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, said: . ‘LA-MRSA has been identified in livestock in a number of countries and . is not considered to represent a significant risk to animal health and . welfare.’ n Sainsbury’s has . recalled packs of its own-brand Kids 20 Pork Cocktail Sausages because . they had the wrong ‘use by’ date of December 25.

Eighties pop star Richard Marx has likened Dr Drew to notorious Jack 'Doctor Death' Kevorkian after news of country singer Mindy McCready's apparent suicide. 'I think ‘Dr’ Drew Pinsky should change his name to Kevorkian. Same results,' he wrote on Twitter Monday night before deleting it several hours later. He later backtracked but but then many began criticizing the doctor's work on Celebrity Rehab, the reality television show that McCready starred in seasons ago. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Addiction: Country singer Mindy McCready is the fifth former Celebrity Rehab contestant to die in the years after their appearance on the reality show . Bad comparison: Richard Marx compared Dr Drew Pinsky (left) to Dr Jack Kevorkian (right) who was known as Dr Death for his enthusiastic support of euthanasia . 'I went too far with the Kevorkian crack. It is, however, my opinion that what Dr. D does is exploitation and his TV track record is not good,' Marx said, referring to the four other show contestants who have died as a result of their drug and addiction battles. Critic: Eighties pop singer Richard Marx likened Dr Drew to the infamous Dr Death . VH1's Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew is not currently on the air. Pinsky switched his focus to non-celebrities in Season 6 last fall and changed the title to 'Rehab.' The show spawned two spinoffs, 'Sober House' and 'Sex Rehab.' McCready was a sympathetic character on the show and appeared to be far less damaged than her fellow cast members, some of whom experienced fairly graphic symptoms of opiate withdrawal in front of the cameras. McCready suffered a seizure while on the show, further endearing her to Pinsky and the others. She said in a 2010 interview with The Associated Press that she initially turned Pinsky down. 'But Dr. Drew said something to me that just mowed me over literally, just floored me,' she said. 'He said, `You've been being treated for the symptoms of what's wrong with you, not the problem. And you're going to have to put your family aside for a moment, put their feelings aside for a moment and worry about you because if you don't get better, it doesn't matter what your family thinks. You're not going to be there anymore.'' Pinsky diagnosed her with 'love addiction' during the series' run and called her an 'angel' in the finale. In . an interview with The Associated Press several months later, he said . McCready had a good shot at recovery if she remained in treatment. Airing grievances: Eighties pop star Richard Marx took to Twitter to slam the famed television doctor . 'Like with anybody I treat, it's really up to them,' Pinsky said. 'I . never know. If they do the work they're supposed to do, yes (there can . be success). If she does the work it will be great. It's up to her how . much of that she does, how much she feels she needs to do. It seems like . she's doing rather well right now so I hope she continues to do so.' Three . years later, she's dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot to the . head, adding her name to a growing list of Celebrity Rehab cast members . who died as a result of their issues. Former Real World contestant Joey . Kovar died in August of last year, just three years after the third . season of Celebrity Rehab aired. Though his family said that he had . maintained his sobriety following the show, an autopsy revealed that his . cause of death was opiate intoxication.  That is believed to be a result of the . painkiller that he was taking at the time, which was called Norco and . classified as an opiate though it was never confirmed that the drug . caused his death. Tragic: Mindy McCready, 37, killed herself on the same front porch where her 'soulmate' David Wilson died on January 13 . Their fellow cast mate Mike Starr, a . bass player from the grunge rock band Alice in Chains, was arrested in . February 2011 for possessing two different types of prescription . medication that were deemed controlled substances. He was found dead . less than a month later as a result of what Dr Drew deemed a . prescription drug overdose. The . two other stars who died after their series aired were actor Jeff . Conaway of Grease fame and Rodney King, the man whose beating sparked . the Los Angeles police brutality riots. Conaway, . who made a name for himself as Kenickie in the musical film, was . featured on both the show's first and second seasons because his . addiction to prescription medication returned following back surgeries. At first it was thought that he died in . May 2011 due to a drug overdose, but Dr Drew later made a public . statement saying that he was placed in a medically induced coma . following a combination of pneumonia and sepsis caused by years of drug . abuse. King, who shot to fame after he was . seen being beaten by police in Los Angeles which went on to prompt the . infamous riots of the early 1990s, was found dead after having drowned . in his swimming pool. The . drowning was ruled an accident but an autopsy proved that he had a mix . of cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol in his system at the time of his . death in June of last year. Mike Starr, a former bassist for the . grunge rock band Alice in Chains, was the first 'Celebrity Rehab' star . to die after his appearance on the show. Starr appeared on the show in 2009 in its third season. He admitted to being addicted to heroin, methadone, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana. In February 2011, Starr was arrested for possessing two kinds of painkillers without a prescription. One . month later, on March 8, 2011, he was found dead at his Salt Lake City, . Utah, home. Dr Drew Pinsky described his death as a 'prescription drug . overdose.' He was 44. Jeff Conaway made a name for himself in 'Grease,' where he played Kenickie. He . appeared on season one of 'Celebrity Rehab' in 2008 in an attempt to . overcome his addiction to alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs. He also appeared in the second season of the show, after he relapsed following back surgery. On . May 11, 2011, Conaway was found unconscious at his home in Encino, . California. Doctors said he was in coma after suffering from pneumonia . with sepsis, which was made worse by his years of drug abuse. Two weeks later, his family took him off life support. He died at age 60. Rodney King became a celebrity after . he his brutal beating by LAPD cops was caught on tape. Their acquittal . resulted in the 1992 Los Angeles riots. King appeared on 'Celebrity Rehab' in 2008 to cope with long-term alcoholism. He also had a history of drug abuse. He . also appeared on 'Sober House' and continued to appear on Dr Drew's . programs as he worked through his substance addictions and trauma from . being battered by police. On June 17, 2012, he was found lying at the bottom of his swimming pool in Rialto, California. An autopsy found alcohol, marijuana and cocaine in his system. He was 47. Joy Kovar's drug an alcohol addiction . became so pronounced during his run on MTV's 'Real World' that he was . kicked off the show in 2008. He joined season three of 'Celebrity Rehab,' which aired in 2010. On the show, he admitted to abusing alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and steroids. His family said he remained clean for six months while he pursued an acting career. On August 17, 2012, he was found dead in an apartment in Chicago. Reports . from the time say he died of a suspected drug overdose after drinking . heavily and taking cocaine and Viagra the night before. McCready walked away from treatment . several days ago after her father asked a judge to intervene. Her body . was found on the front porch of a home she shared with David Wilson, the . longtime boyfriend and father of her youngest son who appears to have . killed himself in the same spot last month. Bob Forrest, a chemical dependency . counselor who appeared on Season 3 of 'Celebrity Rehab' and continues to . work with Pinsky, said a discussion about mental health and substance . abuse issues is important. But attacking Pinsky has only distracted from the real issues. 'Regardless of your feelings about . how we do it with the TV show, calling Dr. Drew `Dr. Kevorkian,' what . kind of dialogue is that?' he said. 'It's a good headline.

Just three cups of tea a day can slash the risk of a stroke by around 20 per cent, new research shows. Scientists found Britain’s favourite hot drink offers powerful protection against the deadly brain blood clots that kill around 200 people every day in the UK. The findings, by researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles, back up research results published earlier this year that suggested four cups a day significantly reduced stroke risk. Three cups of tea a day can cut the risk of a stroke by around 20 per cent, new research has shown . Strokes cost the NHS an estimated £2.3 billion a year to just treat and look after the 100,000 people annually struck down by the life-threatening condition. Only cancer and heart disease kill more people. Around 85 per cent of victims are affected by ischaemic strokes, where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply. The rest are called haemorrhagic strokes, where a blood vessel bursts in the brain, causing potentially fatal bleeding. Although many studies have highlighted the protective effects of tea on the brain, the evidence has still been inconclusive, with other research questioning whether it’s tea that really prevents strokes. A team from UCLA trawled through dozens of previous studies to carry out what’s called a meta-analysis. This is where researchers combine the findings of lots of little studies to come up with more powerful data. In this case, they brought together the findings from five previous meta-analyses to see if tea really does have a significant impact on stroke risk. The results, published online in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed those drinking the highest amount of tea a day - three cups or more - were 20 per cent less likely to fall ill than those drinking little or no tea. Previous studies by the same UCLA team found black tea was just as effective as green tea, as antioxidants in both appear to protect against the kind of damage to arteries that can cause strokes and heart attacks. British consumers get through an estimated 165 million cups every day of mostly black tea. It is packed with components called flavonoids that are thought to be good for the heart and brain.In a report on their findings the researchers said: ‘The strength of this evidence supports the hypothesis that tea consumption might lower the risk of stroke.’","Research shows tea offers protection against the deadly brain blood clots .

Loss: Brandon Holt, 6, was shot dead in April after a neighbor found his father's gun . A father whose four-year-old son used one of his unsecured rifles to shoot dead a six-year-old neighbor as they played has pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal in the case. Anthony Senatore, from Toms River, New Jersey, would have had to serve seven years in prison under the plea deal for six counts of child endangerment. Senatore, 34, is accused of keeping a loaded .22-caliber rifle unsecured in his bedroom. His son found it in April, took it outside to where his friend, Brandon Holt, was sitting in a golf cart and shot him once in the head as they were playing 'pretend shooting'. Brandon died the following day - April 9 - at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. Senator's . lawyer, Robert Ebberup, said in court on Monday that Senatore is . 'deeply horrified over what took place and feels awful about it'. 'His . feelings go out to the family,' Ebberup said. 'Brandon Holt was a . wonderful, wonderful little boy. We just hope that he's in heaven right . now; we're sure he is.' Despite the words of sympathy, the lawyer said Senatore should not have been charged with a crime. Tragic: The father of the boy who shot Brandon (pictured) today pleaded not guilty to six counts of child endangerment after allegedly leaving out his gun for the child to find . Devastated: His parents, Ronald and Christine Holt, have filed a lawsuit against the father for $1 million . 'This is a civil case,' he said. 'This does not belong in a criminal courtroom.' Senatore did not speak during the hearing. Prosecutors had offered him a plea . deal in which he would have served seven years in state prison. He . rejected that offer and plans to proceed toward trial, his lawyer said. 'We don't feel that jail is something that is appropriate,' Ebberup said. If convicted in the trial, he faces up to 10 years in prison. In addition to the gun used in the shooting, Senatore is charged with keeping five other firearms unsecured in his house, where they were allegedly accessible to his children, ages 12, 8 and 4. Holt's family has filed a lawsuit against Senatore and his wife seeking more than $1 million, claiming their actions were reckless. After the death, the family donated Brandon's organs. Brandon's father, Ron Holt, said at the time: 'We both decided that it would help carry his name, that he's helping somebody.' Scene: The little boy was shot dead as he played outside Anthony Senatores' New Jersey home, pictured . Though Toms River is in Ocean County, the prosecutor's office in neighboring Atlantic County is handling the case at the direction of the state attorney general's office. The switch was made because several members of Senatore's family have worked in law enforcement in Ocean County. Under New Jersey law, . residents do not need to register rifles, but they do need a gun . purchaser’s identification card to buy them.

Senior anaesthetist Michael Cowen's behaviour was investigated after the operating surgeon claimed he nodded off during surgery. Hospital bosses confirmed today that an inquiry had been held but decided that the woman patient had not been put at risk by the consultant, who is understood to be aged in his 80s. Nodding off: Senior anaesthetist Michael Cowen allegedly fell asleep during an emergency caesarian but has been allowed back to work . A hospital source, who asked not to be identified, said of Mr Cowen: 'His head was slumped on his chest and he was apparently fast asleep. He didn't even wake up when the surgeon asked him to adjust the anaesthesia. 'The surgeon was furious apparently. It happened towards the end of the operation, when the surgeon instructed Mr Cowen to do something with the anesthetic - to adjust the mixture or something similar. 'Mr Cowen did not reply and when everybody looked at him he was sitting in his chair with his head slumped forward onto his chest - sound asleep. 'The surgeon said something else and Mr Cowen still didn't wake up. In the end the surgeon had to do whatever it was himself.' Two midwives and the surgeon involved made an official complaint to hospital chiefs after the incident earlier this year at Milton Keynes General Hospital. The source added: 'The patient's partner was in the theatre, sitting near her head. He saw what happened and was a bit shaken. But afterwards he was so thrilled about being a new dad and so relieved the baby was alright, that he didn't want to complain.' Abroad: Mr Cowen, who was unavailable for comment at his home today, will not be barred from returning to the hospital where the incident allegedly happened . Mr Cowen, who qualified as a doctor in 1965 and registered as an anaesthetist 12 years ago, was suspended for nine months on full pay while the investigation took place. He lives in Milton Keynes, Bucks. This month he was allowed to return to work at the Milton Keynes hospital. He is also continuing his work as a private consultant at the nearby BMI Saxon Clinic. Milton Keynes General Hospital's medical director, Martin Wetherill, said today: 'A concern was raised about an anaesthetist allegedly falling asleep during a caesarean section procedure. 'A full investigation into the events was conducted. 'The patient involved was not put at risk during the procedure and no concerns were raised by the patient or relatives in regard to the care they received.' The unnamed source said: 'People have decided to speak out because of the safety aspect. How can the hospital say there was no risk to the patient when the anesthetist falls asleep?' Mr Wetherill added that no other claims had been made against Mr Cowen.

Relatives of a woman who died after falling from a window while she was living in a Maoist commune were told she was travelling abroad when she was in fact fighting for her life in hospital, it has emerged. Sian Davies, 44, plunged from the second floor of a three-storey south London terraced house rented by cult leaders Aravindan Balakrishnan and wife Chanda. The graduate, who went to university with Cherie Blair, died in a London hospital from her injuries seven months after the fall in 1997, without her family in Wales ever suspecting she was ill. Detectives have since said they are now looking at the circumstances surrounding the death of Ms Davies. The 44-year-old, originally from Llanelli, joined the commune in the mid-1970s and devoted her life and money to its cause. Her cousin Emyr Morgan spoke today of . the heartache of Ms Davies's family who were cut out of her life for . more than two decades before she died. In . an interview with BBC Wales, he said she 'disappeared' until her death . when they were informed by police that she died after falling from a . window. He also claims the cult wrongly told the . family Ms Davies had gone to India when she was in hospital with the . injuries which eventually claimed her life. The Lambeth property where the cult is alleged to have held three women as 'slaves': Maoist activists Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda have been arrested in connection with the alleged offences . The information was given to her family by cult members in the months before her death when they called a number they had for her. Details about the cult's alleged activities have continued to emerge since police rescued three women from a house in Brixton. The . alleged victims are a 30-year-old Briton, a 57-year-old Irish woman and . a 69-year-old Malaysian, who are all now being cared for. It has been reported that the 30-year-old woman in question, named Rose, is the daughter of Ms Davies. (Left) Aravindan Balakrishnan has been arrested over the alleged offences and (right) one of the alleged victims Josephine, who is now believed to be 57 years old . Mr Morgan said the mother of Ms Davies and her sister had also previously both spoken to her on the phone while she was living in the commune. 'My sister said it felt as if it was a very stunted conversation and that every answer was almost being thought through as if to say ""Am I OK to say this?"",' he told BBC Wales. 'It always felt during the phone conversations that they had that there was somebody else listening to her because it wasn't a natural conversation. There were all these pauses. It was like a transatlantic phone call.' He said that she told them: 'I'm living this new life. You are no longer part of this life. Don't try and contact me. I'll let you know that I'm OK. 'So it was actually very difficult to see whether she was in any danger at all.' Mr Balakrishnan, 73, and his wife, 67, were both arrested last week on suspicion of being involved in forced labour and slavery.

Keyana Cumberbatch, a pupil of St Barbara’s Shouter Baptist Primary School, went missing around 5.20pm on Monday. She was on her way to her grandmother’s apartment, located just metres away from where she lived in Maloney, Port of Spain. The child was being looked after by a male relative prior to her disappearance, local media has reported. Schoolgirl: Keyana Cumberbatch, a pupil at St Barbara¿s Shouter Baptist Primary School, pictured, was found dead in a barrel in her family home, it has been reported . Keyana’s mother, Simone Williams, 27, said she was only made aware of her daughter’s disappearance after she made a call to her mother - who said the child never showed up at her apartment. She was discovered in a barrel located in her family's apartment in Maloney on Friday, according to Stabroek News. Residents who smelt the decay called police who made the discovery, the website adds. An autopsy revealed that the girl died of massive trauma to the head. Pathologist Dr Alexandrov said, 'The trauma to her skull was so extensive that all the tissue which connect bones of the skull were open. Her skull actually was cracked in half. 'These kinds of fractures we call ""hinge fractures"". We see it very often in motor vehicle accidents where significant forces are applied.'

He told officers he walked Keyana to the building where her grandmother’s apartment was located and saw her enter the building, it has been reported. Residents of Maloney, where the girl lived, are said to be hugely distressed and shocked at the news. Many are now calling for better child protections following the horrific crime. Gender, Youth and Child Development Minister Clifton De Couteau told reporters that legislators would soon debate a bill that would create a national child registry and punish people who fail to report crimes against children.","Keyana Cumberbatch went missing on Monday on way home from school .

She has now  lost more than a third of her body weight thanks to a weight-loss CD . But she lost more than a third of her body weight after she met a client for a makeover who had developed a weight-loss CD. Mrs Hallam was given a CD by Sandra Roycroft-Davis who invented the Slimpod weight loss method. Users listen to the CD, which gently encourages people to avoid fatty food, for 10 minutes as she fell asleep each night. Incredibly, Mrs Hallam managed to ditch takeaways and all fizzy drinks and lost an astonishing five stone in just 10 weeks. She managed to slim down to nine stone and a size 10 dress size between July and September 2010. Mrs Hallam piled on the pounds after gorging on takeaways washed down with 300 cans of full fat coke every month. At her heaviest, the 4ft 11in beautician tipped the scales at 14 stone and was a size 18 . She said: 'I used to drink Coke with every meal, and fizzy drinks always, never anything else. 'But now I feel so much better. The Slimpod helped my diet but the big change was just the drinks. 'Because there’s less sugar I feel more active, my skin feels nicer and my teeth are in much better shape.' The mother-of-three from Newark, Nottinghamshire, has now been awarded slimmer of the year for using the Slimpod. She said: 'I felt like there was no way I could lose the weight. 'I had given up after I tried practically everything, I tried slim fast, weight watchers, you name it, but I couldn’t get anything to work. 'It is amazing, the moment I gave up on finding something I stumbled across it. Within days of trying the weight-loss CD Mrs Hallam was craving water and salad - two things she usually disliked . 'When I met Sandra she was looking for people for the trial so I thought why not? 'I popped the CD in as I went to bed and then Trevor (the voice of the Slimpod CD) started talking and I cannot remember what he said. 'But the next day when I got to Lincoln with my mum I just did not want the Burger King meal. 'I wanted water, I used to hate water, and a salad - two things I could not stand.' Users are advised to listen every day for 21 days at first. But Mrs Hallam listened to it every day for 12 weeks. 'I was amazed that something so simple could have such a massive impact on my life. “I got down to nine stone which I’ve maintained for two-and-a-half years through sensible eating and lots of walking. It was almost effortless.' She would listen to the recording for 10 minutes in the evening. 'And almost overnight I had no urge to gorge myself on junk food any more,' she says.

A First World War soldier's lost medal, which was thrown away in anger upon learning his two sons had died in action, has been returned to his family after 90 years. Private Thomas William Copeman was presented with the 1914-15 Star after joining the Army Veterinary Corps, but discarded the honour when he came home to find that both his sons had been killed during combat on the Western Front. It was finally discovered under six-inches of mud in a field in Bergh Apton, near Norwich, by metal detector enthusiast Paul Nunn. And thanks to an internet appeal, the family has been reunited with the piece of history. Reunited: Ann Daynes, (left), David Forder and Mary Brooks with their grandfather Private Thomas William Copeman's 1914-15 Star, which was buried in a field for decades . The medal is now in the hands of his three grandchildren, David Forder, 81, Mary Brookes, 80, and 79 year old Ann Daynes, who all still live in the county. The siblings saw Mr Nunn's appeal in the local newspaper, but had no clue the honour belonged to their grandfather, who died in 1924, until they were sent a letter explaining the discovery. Mr Forder says: 'I saw a bit in the paper about the medal but it didn't register. Honour: The medal remains in good shape despite being under six-inches of mud in a field in Norfolk for 90 years . 'I didn't think any more about it until I got a letter through the post from the couple who found it. It was a bit of a surprise but I thought about it and called them back the next day. 'When I rang them up my sister had already arranged a meeting.' The item was especially poignant for Mr Forder, who had never even seen a photograph of his mother Hilda's father. He adds: 'I wasn't even born when my grandfather died in 1924 and I have never even seen a photo of him. 'I can't remember my mother saying much about him but now I have been able to build up a picture of him. It has just come out of the blue and as the days go on it goes deeper and deeper.' Mr Forder is now determined that the medal will be handed down through the generations: 'Whoever finishes up with it will pass it down the line to their children and grandchildren so we make sure that now it stays in the family.' Mr Nunn and his wife, Kirsty, spread word of their find on Facebook and Twitter, where it was picked up by the Brother's Wish Genealogy Service, which sought out the names and addresses of Private Copeman’s grandchildren. He now believes that there could be more medals belonging to the war veteran lying undiscovered in the same field. He said: 'It was great to reunite Pte Copeman's family with his medal. Things moved unbelievably quickly from the original post going on Twitter to us meeting them. 'They said they don't know what happened to the other two medals that are usually awarded with the star so they could still be in the field. I will keep looking for them.' Heavy metal: Paul Nunn and his partner Kirsty launched an appeal to find Private Copeman's family after discovering the medal while using a metal detector .

But the truth is exactly that, according to a poll which says crisp winter weather, a clean house and duvet days are the things which make us smile. The survey asked 2,000 people in Britain about their favourite pleasures. What a view! With scenes like this in the Lake District, it's no surprise our top pleasures include walks in the countryside. Others included cuddles, saying 'I love you', duvet days and sitting down in a clean house . At number one was having a cuddle with a partner - followed closely by clean sheets at number two. Country walks and saying 'I love you' also made it into the top ten, though not everything was free. The top ten also included chocolate, booking a holiday, Christmas dinner and alcohol. However, Nick Giles, managing director of Ordnance Survey Leisure which ran the poll, said the full list showed how simple pleasures are still the best. 'Our everyday lives are becoming so much more stressful and busier than ever before,' he added. 'Because of this, many of us appreciate things like reading a book or going for a stroll a lot more than we used to. The good life: A cuddle with a partner came in at number one, followed by lazy days at home (posed by models) Temptation: Despite having simple tastes we still can't resist a good cheese board, which hit number 17 .

Pleasures which can't be bought included kissing, snuggling under a blanket, hugging your baby and 'good photos'. Receiving post and flowers also featured, as did a day at the beach. Among the more costly items were edible treats - including cheese boards, chocolate, steak, pub roasts, picnics and cake.

A macabre selection of personal items that once belonged to former Boston crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger are due to be auctioned off to raise funds for his victims. The lists of belongings to be sold includes jewelry, clothing and a boxing mannequin that Bulger used to leave propped near the window of his apartment to make it look as though there was someone keeping lookout. The U.S. Marshals Service is set to go ahead with the sale despite some concerns that it may be perceived as glorifying the convicted mobster if items of little value are included. The U.S. Marshals Service is set to auction off many of the items seized from Bulger's California apartment after his arrest two years ago, including a boxer mannequin . Bulger, right, was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month and now his belongings are due to be sold with the proceeds going to his victims . ‘The reality is there are lots of people who would be willing to pay money for some or all of the contents of that apartment, and that money is going to victims and victims' families. So we want to do what we can to get as much money as we can for them,’ First Assistant US Attorney Jack Pirozzolo told The Boston Globe. Officials believe the highest-value items include a claddagh ring estimated to be worth $48,000 and Bulger's replica 1986 Stanley Cup championship ring valued at about $3,000. Other items include binoculars, a telescope, camouflage clothing, nine fedoras, 27 pairs of sunglasses, ceramic poodle salt and pepper shakers, assorted porcelain cats and hundreds of books, many with Bulger's handwritten notes scrawled in the margins. There's also a McCain/Palin campaign button and a God Bless America poster. The items, including a selection of mobster-related books were found when police raided Bulger's apartment at the Princess Eugenia complex, in Santa Monica, California . Authorities said they're trying to be sensitive to the victims in the case and have yet to decide whether it is appropriate to cash in on Bulger's notoriety by selling some of the other items, ranging from his blue and white dinnerware to his size 9.5 sneakers. The items due to be auctioned off were seized from Bulger's California apartment after his arrest two years ago. The 84-year-old Bulger was sentenced . this month to life in prison. He was found guilty in August by a federal . jury in 11 of the 19 killings he was accused of, along with dozens of . other gangland crimes, including shakedowns and money laundering. The profits will be split among the families of those who were killed by Bulger. Two relatives of Bulger victims backed the effort to get as much money as possible. Authorities have said that they're trying to be sensitive to the victims and have yet to decide whether it is appropriate to cash in on Bulger's notoriety by selling all of the items . ‘If they can sell anything he owned down to a ballpoint pen, then good luck to them,’ said Patricia Donahue, whose husband, Michael Donahue, was shot to death by Bulger in 1982 while giving a ride home to a man who was being targeted. ‘I'm sure the victims could use the money.’ 'They are trying to do the right thing,' said Tim Connors, whose father was gunned down by Bulger in 1975. Jason Wojdylo, chief inspector of the asset forfeiture division of the U.S. Marshals Service, said the U.S. attorney's office will decide what to sell. After the court approves a sale, it usually takes up to 60 days to schedule an auction, he said. Bulger fled Boston in 1994 after being tipped off by his former FBI handler that he was about to be indicted, and he remained a fugitive for more than 16 years until he was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011.

A New York couple claim their desperately ill newborn son was denied a heart transplant by hospital because he suffers a mental disability. Autumn Chenkus, 32, and her boyfriend, Charlie Higgs, allege that New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan refused to put their child, Maverick, onto a transplant list because he had a rare genetic defect. Refusing to believe that their sons Coffin-Siris syndrome was a valid reason not to put him on the transplant list, Autumn and Charlie embarked on a month-long battle to get Maverick treatment - culminating in a fateful trip to Boston in June. Scroll Down for Video . Recovery: Marverick at home in New York in his mother, Autumns arms - as he recovers from his life threatening heart failure . Named after Tom Cruise's fighter pilot character in Top Gun, little Maverick was born with a severe heart defect in Manhattan in September of 2012. He had his first surgery at the age of 4-days old at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, a part of the New York-Presbyterian system and was kept in intensive care through Christmas. However, his condition began to deteriorate and by March he was fast running out of options. It was a god-send for his parents when he was accepted as an eligible transplant candidate on March 18th, but just two days later everything changed. Disgust: Autumn Chenkus and Charlie Higgs were distraught to be told by New York-Presbyterian Hospital refused their child for a heart transplant in March . Loving mother: Autumn with Maverick as he recovered in hospital in New York as he descended into heart failure after his birth in September 2012 . Charlie and Autumn were called into a hospital conference room and informed that their son had been diagnosed with Coffin-Siris syndrome. The disease causes children to grow up with intellectual and development disabilities as compared to other children. According to a recent study, babies with Coffin-Siris sit, walk, and speak later than other children on average. Fewer than 100 cases of Coffin-Siris have been reported worldwide since it was identified in the 1970s. On March 22nd, another meeting was convened by the doctors and Autumn and Charlie were told that their son was no longer considered a candidate for transplant. Doctors said that those with Coffin-Siris tend to have compromised immune systems and are also at risk for tumors and infections according to a report from CNN. Autumn and Charlie were told that because of this any transplant would be too risky and therefore he was sadly being taken off the list. His medical record includes a note about the meeting, signed by Dr. Linda Addonizio, medical director of Presbyterian's pediatric cardiac transplant program. 'His genetic defect is associated with increased infections and tumors, which would be greatly magnified combined with the immunosuppression involved in transplantation,' the note said. 'I discussed that this does not mean we are giving up on Maverick, but trying to improve his heart failure as best as possible and get him to gain weight.' Happy: Charlie and Autumn with Maverick at home in New York after returning from hospital in Boston after successful treatment . However, according to Autumn, the doctors were cold and told her that she should simply enjoy the time she had left with her son. Stunned, shocked and distraught by the news, Autumn suspected that doctors were not giving her son a chance. She emailed the author of the Dutch study which New York-Presbyterian physicians cited as a reason for not giving Maverick the chance of a transplant. Dr. Gijs Santen at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands wrote back saying catergorically that children with Coffin-Siris do not have compromised immune systems. 'It is difficult to use infection risk as a reason not to perform a heart transplant,' said Dr. Gijs Santen to CNN. More to the point, Autumn opened up a dialogue with Dr. Grange Coffin - who along with Dr. Evelyn Siris discovered the syndrome in 1970 at the University of California. 'Coffin-Siris is not a reason to say no to a transplant,' said Dr. Grange Coffin. 'I would say it's wrong to do so.' Presbyterian still wouldn't budge. They insisted they would not give Maverick a transplant. Autumn called another meeting on April 12, when Maverick was 6 months old and doctors repreated their position that there would be no transplant. Sick: Maverick has the genetic condition Coffin-Siris syndrome - which can lead to developmental issues with children as they grow older . Autumn said that the doctors even looked at their watches to indicate that they had somewhere else they would rather be and left as she began to sob. 'The more I fought, the less they listened,' she said. 'But I knew that going home to die was not his fate,' said Autumn. Refusing to let their son died, Charlie and Autumn tried to get him a transplant and contacted Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the Cleveland Clinic and Boston Children's Hospital. On May 6 they were turned down by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a few days after that by the Cleveland Clinic. Desperate, Autumn and Charlie drove to Boston to speak face to face with the doctors there to save their sons life. They got what they wanted on Mary 18, Maverick was taken by ambulance from New York to Boston where he was prepared for surgery. His medications were changed and his weight increased. Maverick's condition improved and amazingly on June 7, doctors called in Autumn and Charlie and told them that their son would not be getting a transplant. This time however, it wasn't because of his medical prognosis it was because he didn't need one anymore. 'I felt like the weight of the world had been taken off my shoulders,' she said. 'The difference between Boston and all the other hospitals is the way they cared -- the fact that they cared,' she said. Charlie and Autumn have filed a complaint againt New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. 'The hospital first said the decision was based on Maverick being at a heightened risk for tumors and infection. We later learned that this was false information and that Maverick is not at a heightened risk for tumors or infection,' Higgs wrote in the complaint according to CNN.","Maverick Higgs was born in September 2012 with a heart defect .

China yesterday sent warplanes into a disputed region of the South China Sea it has claimed as within its air defence zone - days after America, Japan and South Korea flew through the area. State media reported that the country plans to take ‘defensive emergency measures’ if any aircraft flying through the zone fail to identify themselves. China’s air force sent several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft on normal air patrols into the area, air force spokesman Colonel Shen Jinke told the Xinhua agency. The report did not specify exactly when the flights were sent or whether they had encountered foreign aircraft. China sent warplanes into a disputed region of the South China Sea it has claimed as within its air defence zone (stock photograph) It happened after the United States, Japan and South Korea said they have sent flights through the zone without encountering Chinese response since Beijing announced the creation of the zone last week. The zone includes an area of sea where gas had been discovered, which previously was only in an air defence zone marked out by Japan. Both countries regard any land there as within their economic zones, meaning they claim the exclusive right to any income to be made from the territory. The row centres on airspace to the north east of what the Japanese call the Senkaku islands, and what China calls the Diaoyu. Taiwan also lays claim over the Senkaku islands, and South Korea maintains claims over a submerged rock in the northern part of China’s new air defence zone. China’s reassertion of its sovereignty over the area yesterday marked a worrying escalation of the dispute. Col Shen described the flights as ‘a defensive measure and in line with international common practices.’ He said China’s air force would remain on high alert and will take measures to protect the country’s airspace. China says the establishment of the zone was ‘completely justified and legitimate’. The row centres on airspace to the north east of what the Japanese call the Senkaku islands, and what China calls the Diaoyu . Without prior notice, Beijing began demanding on Saturday that passing aircraft identify themselves and accept Chinese instructions or face consequences. The move has been widely condemned, however, with America describing it as a ‘destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region’. Concerns have grown over an escalation in tensions because both China and Japan have large naval fleets in the waters around the South China Sea. Some experts believe the spark for the latest action is thought to have been Japan’s threat last month to shoot down drones China says it will send to the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands for mapping expeditions. While China’s surprise announcement last week to create the zone initially raised tensions in the region, some analysts believe Beijing’s motive was not to trigger an aerial confrontation but a more long-term strategy to solidify claims to disputed territory by simply marking the area as its own. China’s lack of efforts to stop the foreign flights - including two U.S. B-52s that flew through the zone on Tuesday - has been an embarrassment for Beijing. Even some Chinese state media outlets suggested on Thursday that Beijing may have mishandled the episodes.","China has claimed disputed region of South China Sea as within its air defence zone .

A New Yoker who sued after his real name and address were broadcast on MTV's 'True Life: I'm a Chubby Chaser' has been told he has fat chance of seeing a penny. Tristan Watson and roommate Nadine Crosbie brought a lawsuit against the reality show's producers last year. The couple claimed that they were duped into thinking their home address would not be shown and that Watson would only be identified by the name 'Tee' on the show. Duped: Tristan Watson (pictured) and his roommate Nadine Crosbie filed suit against the reality show's producers last year, saying the show tricked them into thinking Watson's full name wouldn't be used and their home address wouldn't be shown . Thrown out: A Manhattan Supreme Court judge tossed the suit, finding the pair's agreement with the producers didn't contain any of those guarantees . A  'Chubby Chaser' is person of any sexuality who is attracted to another person who is overweight. For a certain subset of the male population — referred to in the scientific community as 'fat admirers' — overweight women are the ideal. A recent study, published in The Journal of Sex Research, finds that not only do FAs prefer overweight women, but that they also find a wider range of body sizes attractive than other men do. The program focused on people who intentionally seek out extra-plump partners. According to the lawsuit, Watson complained that despite verbal assurances and an email from a producer in 2011 telling him not to worry, his full first name was used on air. During an internet broadcast in 2012, the show didn't do anything to conceal the location of the couples New York home. Their 'address and apartment number were clearly, identifiably displayed,' the suit said. Mr Chubby Chaser: The True Life""episode was about people who like to date other people generally considered to be very overweight. Watson's segment was about his relationship and his cousin's disapproval of it . Greivance: After the show aired, Watson said that he received threatening letters and experienced employment troubles. He said that he negotiated for months before agreeing to be on the show to make sure that he'd be protected . The problem was made worse for Watson and Crosbie after his cousin also appeared on the show. The couple claim that after the show broadcast the pair were harassed and got death threats. 'Since the premiere of the episode, plaintiffs have been repeatedly harassed at their home,' with Watson having a death threat 'slipped under the front of his door of his apartment,' the suit said. The show's producers said Watson and Crosbie didn't have a leg to stand on after they signed a release allowing their likenesses to be used and filming to be done at their home. Fat chance: Judge Marcy Friedman of the New York State Supreme Court granted MTV¿s motion to dismiss the complaint, finding no legal evidence to support Tristan Watson¿s claim that the show's productio caused him undue pain and hardship . No cause for complain: The couple participated in the show for about a year before the piece was finally aired . In an affidavit, Watson said that after the menacing warnings, 'I no longer felt safe leaving my apartment and I lost my job as a result.' The pair brought a lawsuit against MTV and the show's producers for $2.5 million, charging them with fraud, breach of contract and negligence. but The show's producers said Watson and Crosbie had voluntarily agreed to appear on the show. They also agreed not to sue for any reason. MTV's filing noted the pair had participated in the show for 'nearly a year' before it aired. In a ruling earlier this month, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Marcy Friedman threw the suit out. The judge ruled that the producers didn't breach any of the guarantees they had already promised to the couple.","Tristan Watson and roommate Nadine Crosbie said they faced death threats after their real names and apartment were featured on the show .

A brave mother led rescuers to the wreckage of a plane crash she had survived in Alaska as she desperately tried to get help for her baby boy who died in the accident. Melanie Coffee walked for nearly a mile to find help after the light aircraft she had been traveling in with nine other people crashed in fog and freezing conditions on Friday. Four people, including Miss Coffee's five-month-old son, Wyatt, died when a single-engine Cessna 208, making a scheduled flight to Saint Mary's, crashed at about 6.30pm. Crash: The wreckage of the plane which came down near a remote Alaskan village . Raise the alarm: Melanie Coffee, pictured with her son, walked nearly a mile to find held . When efforts by the 25-year-old to revive her five-month-old son Wyatt failed, Miss Coffee made the agonizing decision to go in search of rescuers. 'I believe she's the real hero in this,' Saint Mary's Village Police Officer Fred Lamont Jr said. The village, like many in the remote region, is off the road system and residents rely on aircraft to get around. Miss Coffee had called emergency services but search efforts were hampered by the fog as rescue workers used cars and snowmobiles to try to find the site. Despite having chest injuries, Miss Coffee was able to find a rescue party and lead them to the crash site, where her baby, the pilot Terry Hansen, 68, and passengers Rose Polty, 57, and Richard Polty, 65, had died. The surviving passengers, four of them in critical condition, had to be carried away on stretchers and then airlifted to hospital. Loss: Five-month-old Wyatt Coffee was one of four people killed in the crash . They were named as Pauline Johnson, 37, Kylan Johnson, 14, Tanya Lawrence, 35, Garrett Moses, 30, and Shannon Lawrence. Everyone on board, except the pilot and Shannon Lawrence, lived in Mountain Village. Mr Hansen was from Bethel but the address for Shannon Lawrence was not known. Megan Peters, a spokeswoman for the Alaska State Troopers, said the aircraft would have been flying in freezing rain. Office Lamont described the conditions as ice fog with moisture that stuck to vehicles. NTSB Investigator Clint Johnson said the cause of the crash has not been determined and that the investigation was 'very much in the preliminary stages'. Two investigators were on their way to Bethel on Saturday to meet troopers for transportation to the crash site. Reaching the wreckage would depend on weather and safety considerations, Ms Peters said. Frantic: Melanie tried to revive Wyatt before going in search of rescue crews who were lost in the fog . Regular route: The plane, similar to this Hageland Aviation Cessna 208, was making a scheduled flight . 'There's no rush to get there,' she said. 'There's no reason to risk anyone's life because no one's life is in jeopardy.' A statement by Jim HIckerson, the president of Hageland Aviation, which owned the aircraft, described the crash as 'an unspeakable tragedy'. 'Hageland is working to gather information to answer questions and do what we can to ease the suffering of those involved in the accident,' he said.","25-year-old Melanie Coffee led rescuers to wreckage after fog hampered search efforts .

Bulmers' blunder: This is the advert featuring Methodist clergyman Hugh Price-Hughes, a lifelong teetotaller who campaigned against alcohol . Executives at cider brand Bulmers have . admitted that they blundered by advertising the drink with a picture of . a teetotal Victorian vicar who campaigned against alcohol. The . Hereford-based drinksmaker thought it had found a photograph of . Reverend CH Bulmer, who gave his sons the money to start up the . business 120 years ago. Next to the black and white picture was the slogan: 'We hope he'd be proud.' But the man in the picture, had he known what it was being used for, would almost certainly not have been proud. It turns out the photograph was of Hugh Price-Hughes, a Methodist clergyman, who devoted his life to helping alcoholics. Born in Camarthen in 1847, Price-Hughes worked as a minister in various circuits, founding new churches wherever he went. He . was the founder of the Methodist Times and while superintendent of the . Brixton (London) circuit he launched the Wesleyan Forward Movement. That organisation which was behind the construction of many of the big city Methodist . missions that still stand today. The mistake was spotted after Heineken, who own Bulmers, spent tens of thousands of pounds on the advertising campaign. But after the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) was told of the blunder the company scrapped the advertisements and posters. The . gaffe comes after the watchdog dismissed a separate complaint relating . to a television advert for Bulmers which one viewer said implied 'the . success of a social occasion was always dependent on alcohol'. Close to the wire: The gaffe came after the ASA dismissed another complaint against Bulmers for an . advert which one viewer said implied 'the success of a social occasion . was always dependent on alcohol' The . advert showed a night out in reverse, with a group of friends drinking . Bulmers at various points during the evening and particularly the . beginning. Teetotal: Hugh Price-Hughes was the founder of the Methodist Times and the Wesleyan Forward Movement, which built many Methodist missions . A voiceover . said: 'We don’t have a master plan, so we don’t know where the night . will take us. But one thing is certain. It will begin with a Bulmers.' The Drinks Business reported the ASA as saying: 'While we considered it was clear that the characters in the ad intended to drink alcohol, we noted the product was shown on only a few occasions and that the characters did not appear to behave as though they had consumed alcohol irresponsibly. 'We considered the ad did not imply the success of the social occasions was dependent on the consumption of alcohol and therefore concluded that it did not breach the Code.' A company spokesman said of the latest adverts: 'We fully appreciated the distress caused by using the wrong image.' Heineken are making a donation to the church in Carmarthen, West Wales, where Rev Price-Hughes was the minister in 1870s.","Firm's picture of CH Bulmer turned out to be a photo of Hugh Price-Hughes .

A dressmaker made famous by appearing on TV's Big Fat Gypsy Weddings is being sued for sacking the head designer at her boutique. Thelma Madine paid Leanne Phillips £400 a week to design dresses for Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool, and praised her for taking the business 'to another level'. But last December, she fired the 31-year-old after six years, allegedly after a row at the shop. Sued: Thelma Madine, who found fame on Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, is facing a claim for unfair dismissal from her former head designer . Sacked: Leanne Phillips was fired from Nico Bridal Company last December after working there for six years . Ms Madine, 61, makes wedding and christening dresses aimed at young women and girls from the traveller community. She was featured on Channel 4's reality TV show Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, and went on to star in her own spin-off, Thelma's Gypsy Girls. Ms . Phillips also featured in the show as one of Ms Madine's closest . associates - but on December 6 last year, she was sacked from Nico. She is now suing her former boss for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal which will take place next Monday. Collaborators: Ms Phillips, left, and Ms Madine, right, posing with a dress made of hair . In her claim, Ms Phillips alleges . her boss sacked her after a row, then attempted to gather further . evidence against her by quizzing other employees. She . also claims the workplace was ‘unstructured’ when it came to . disciplinary matters, and that attempts to appeal her boss's decision . were ignored. The . disciplinary hearing against her was chaired by Ms Madine, Ms Phillips . claims, even though she herself was the complainant too. The former . designer also says that Ms Madine was often at the centre of 'heated . arguments' at the business, which never led to disciplinary action . against anyone else. Ms Phillips is demanding £1,200 in back pay which she says she is owed, and also wants to be reinstated to her old job. Fame: Ms Madine, 61, spent time in prison before achieving celebrity on Channel 4 . Responding to the claims in an . official tribunal court document, Ms Madine admitted that no formal . disciplinary policy existed but claimed she felt intimidated during the . row, which was apparently sparked when the employee asked for a day off. Ms Phillips apparently screamed 'you horrible b****' at the manager and kept interrupting a discussion between her mother, who also worked at the company, and Ms Madine, according to the document. Ms . Madine said that she only consulted Ms Phillips' colleagues in order to . obtain evidence about the argument, and added that those co-workers freely . volunteered information about previous alleged wrongdoing. She added that she had . conducted a lengthy investigation into the issue, and said she . had not withheld any information from Ms Phillips. An appeal was apparently heard by a solicitor independent of the firm, who concluded that Ms Madine was right to fire Ms Phillips and it would be 'untenable' for the latter to return to the firm. The boss denied that there was 'a culture of arguments involving shouting, swearing and intimidation' at the business. Extravagant: One of the over-the-top wedding dresses featured in Big Fat Gypsy Weddings . Praise: Ms Madine once described Ms Phillips as 'full of imaginative ideas and passion' as an employee . 'I totally deny any wrongdoing,' Ms Phillips said. 'I believe I was unfairly treated after a long and loyal service. 'It has been really hard to come to terms with. My job at Nico was my life and losing it was heartbreaking. 'It . came at completely the wrong time, as I was recently engaged and . planning my own wedding. I had never been out of work since leaving . school and found unbearable the thought of signing on benefits a few . weeks before Christmas. 'After . Christmas, I started job-hunting - I even applied for a job at a hotel, . but my fiancé and family were upset that I was wasting my talents so . they encouraged me to set up my own business. 'I . can't wait until the tribunal is over and I can put that part of my . life behind me. I am looking forward to designing and making my own . dresses for the travelling community and building a future for myself . and my family.' She has now set up a competing design company, Leanne Alexandra, which also makes dresses for travellers. Wacky: A palm tree dress and a pineapple dress worn by participants in the Channel 4 show . Boutique: Ms Madine employed Ms Phillips at this Nico Bridal Shop in Liverpool . Ms Madine effusively praised Ms Phillips in her autobiography, Tales Of The Gypsy Dressmaker, which was published last year. She . wrote: 'Leanne is now the head designer at Nico and is starting to . oversee parts of the process that I had to do, which is great, because . it means that I can concentrate on other parts of the business. 'I . used to feel that every one of my dresses was like my baby and that no . one could do them as well as me - I am a bit of a control freak! - but I . know now that the future of Nico is in Leanne's hands. 'Since she started working for me, Leanne has taken Nico to another level. 'And I have to admit that she reminds me of me at her age, full of imaginative ideas and passion for the task in hand.' Ms . Madine, a mother of three, started sewing 18 years ago after the . breakdown of her marriage, and began by selling dresses at a market . stall in Liverpool.

First developed in the late 1990s, the suits allow people to glide through the air subject to the wind. People using wingsuits often jump from base exit points or from skydiving aircraft to give them enough altitude to fly for up to five minutes before they land. A wingsuit is also known as a squirrel suit or birdman suit. It is made up of two arm wings and a leg wing supported by the use of inflatable pressurised nylon cells. The person wearing the suit uses his or her body to control forward speed, direction and lift. It can take years of practice to be able to use a wingsuit correctly. A good wingsuiter can achieve speeds as low as 25mph which is 80 per cent lower than a regular skydiver and horizontal speeds of up to 220mph.","Robert Morgan took to the skies above the Great Basin National Park .

Jailed: Timothy Deakin, 18, approached Luke Chadwick in a bar and pretended to whisper in his ear but then bit it off in an unprovoked attack . A teenage yob bit off a stranger’s ear in a random attack after he exploited cheap 'two for a fiver' spirit promotions to drink himself into a stupor. Timothy Deakin, 18, had spent £30 on Jagerbomb alcoholic energy drinks and knocked back ten double brandies and cola on a night out at three different bars before attacking Luke Chadwick. The victim, 21, who was at Pics Bar in Bury, Greater Manchester, thought Deakin was whispering something to him but then suddenly felt a 'strange sensation'. He then saw Deakin spit something on the floor but had no idea what it was until moments later when other revellers asked why he was bleeding from the side of his face. Police were called to the bar, arrested Deakin and had to search the club for the ear. The victim now suffers a 'significant cosmetic disability'. Deakin woke up in a police cell claiming he could remember nothing of the incident. He recalled drinking in Yates wine lodge and neighbouring GCHQ bar but remembered nothing else. He told police: 'I had been drinking in Yates in Bury. I went to GCHQ but from that point remember nothing - I woke up in a cell at the police station. 'I drank around ten double brandy and Cokes and spent £30 on Jagerbombs - they were two for £5. I wonder if my drink was spiked as the effects came on so fast. I do not know Luke Chadwick and if I have caused the injury I am very sorry.' Details of the attack earlier this month emerged as Deakin, also known as Timothy Tibble, was jailed for four years and eight months after he admitted wounding with intent. Bolton Crown Court was told Deakin, who already had 26 previous convictions and had been locked away when he was 13, went on his giant drinking spree on October 5. Mr Benjamin Myers prosecuting said he approached Mr Chadwick inside Pic's bar and leaned over as if to ‘whisper’ something in his ear. Black-out: Deakin was arrested after the attack at Pic's Bar in Bury, . Greater Manchester, but had no recollection of the incident when he . awoke in a police cell the next morning. He admitted he'd spent £30 on . 'two for a fiver' Jagerbombs and had also consumed ten double brandies with cola that night . 'Mr Chadwick felt a strange sensation in his ear and at first didn’t know what had happened,' said Mr Myers. 'At that point he saw the defendant spit something out onto the floor. When he went outside people asked why he was bleeding from the side of his head. 'Police soon entered and the defendant was restrained and he said he hadn’t done anything wrong. An officer had to perform a search inside the club to see if he could find the ear.' Mr Chadwick was said to have been left in deep shock by the incident. In mitigation Deakin’s counsel Michael Johnson said he had acted in a ‘moment of madness’, and undone any positive work he had been doing under the guidance of the authorities. Mr Johnson added: 'He didn’t enjoy love and affection during his childhood,' he said. 'His parents had addiction issues. But there is potential for him to move forward when he is released.' Cheap booze: A court heard Deakin had drunk himself in to a stupor by taking advantage of drink promotions at bars in Bury, including Pic's Bar, pictured . Sentencing, Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'With no provocation you approached another man with whom you had no grievance and in a very determined way you sunk your teeth into one of his ears and bit him until you succeeded in severing a significant portion of his ear and then spat it out on the floor. 'You didn’t have any explanation for what you did apart from you were drunk. You have a personal background which has resulted in a substantial disadvantage to your growing up. 'It is hoped that with assistance you will leave behind your troubled beginnings and as an adult you will go on to live a law abiding and responsible life.' According to its Facebook page, Pic's Bar, which opens until 4am, sells two cocktails for £5 and offers 'half price Jagerbombs all night’. This week GCHQ bar were advertising a Halloween event where drinks cost just £1. Yates were advertising two cocktail jugs for £10 and other drinks as little as £1.50. Scientists have warned Jagerbombs - and mixing other alcohol with energy drinks like Red Bull - was more likely to trigger impulsive and often 'risky behaviour' than drinking traditional cocktails like a gin and tonic.

One of the country’s largest energy firms said it was likely to freeze prices until 2015 after George Osborne unveiled plans to reduce green levies. Ahead of his Autumn Statement this week the Chancellor gave details of reforms which he said would see £50 shaved off energy bills. He also announced new handouts of up to £1,000 for homeowners to spend on insulation and energy-efficient boilers - saying it would be funded by a fresh crackdown on tax avoidance. Checking the bill: Details of handouts of up to £1,000 for homeowners to spend on energy-saving measures have been revealed (file picture) But last night one Tory backbencher said David Cameron would be able to reduce gas and electricity bills further if he stopped listening to his Liberal Democrat colleagues and axed the green levies altogether. George Osborne’s Autumn Statement on Thursday will include a range of changes, including a freeze in business taxes for small firms, and a £250million boost to the British Business Bank to help small companies access funding. And he confirmed yesterday that it would include an announcement that the government would pay for some green measures currently included in people’s bills - cutting the cost for families across the country. In addition, energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes, enabling costs to consumers to be spread out. The moves were welcomed by the energy firms - and the Chancellor said he was certain that the average £50 saving from slashing the Energy Company Obligation - would be passed on by energy firms to consumers. Preview: Ahead of his Autumn Statement this week, Chancellor George Osborne gave details of reforms which he said would see £50 shaved off energy bills . ‘This will help families,’ he said. ‘We’ve been in discussions with the energy companies. We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in.’ A spokesman for EDF said its ‘decision to hold back the full impact of rising costs’ earlier this month by implementing lower rise than competitors had been ‘validated by the conformation that the Government will take action on energy changes’. ‘Customers should expect other energy suppliers to follow EDF’s lead by significantly lowering their prices,’ he said. In addition, anyone buying a home will be eligible for the £1,000 grant for energy efficiency measures, such as installing insulation or replacing the boiler. The sum could be even higher if the property needs a great deal of work. Asked how £1,000 grants for homebuyers to improve energy efficiency and cuts to environmental levies on bills would be funded, Mr Osborne replied: ‘The money will come from additional taxes that we will raise from dealing with tax avoidance.’ He refused to give details of the tax avoidance crackdown but said people were wrong to be sceptical about whether such action really raised revenue. ‘This government has taken step after step and the amount of tax we collect from people who were previously avoiding their tax goes up by billions of pounds over this parliament,’ he said. The Chancellor attacked Labour’s pledge of a 20-month freeze on energy prices if they win the election - which has been dominating the political agenda since Ed Miliband announced it in September. Idea: One Tory backbencher said David Cameron would be able to reduce gas and electricity bills further if he stopped listening to his Liberal Democrat colleagues and axed the green levies altogether . ‘We are doing it in the way that government can do it, which is controlling the costs that families incur because of government policies,’ he said. ‘We are also doing it in the way that is not going to damage the environment or in any way reduce our commitment to dealing with climate change.’ Lib Dem president Tim Farron claimed credit for the retention of green levies - after reports that Mr Cameron had wanted to get rid of some of the green ‘c***’ in his policies. ‘It’s been a job and a half over the last month to make sure we hold him to those pledges and the green core of this government,’ he said. ‘And that is why we are not scrapping the investment; we’re just making sure it’s funded from general taxation - that is absolutely right. ‘Fuel bills is a huge and important issue... but I’ll tell you what, all those things even pale into insignificance compared to the threat of climate change so we absolutely must hold the Prime Minister to account on this issue.’ 'This government has taken step after step and the amount of tax we collect from people who were previously avoiding their tax goes up by billions of pounds over this parliament' Chancellor George Osborne . Last night Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell said: ‘David Cameron should be responding to the common sense of the British people, rather than to Lib Dems like Tim Farron. ‘This is the tragedy of Coalition as it prevents people taking the proper choices rather than, like the Lib Dems, posing and preening.’ Ed Miliband will today dismiss the Government’s energy levies shake-up as ‘smoke and mirrors’, saying ministers do not ‘get’ the cost-of-living crisis. The Labour leader is to insist that the ‘cosy deal’ reached with the ‘Big Six’ power firms will still see bills going up this winter. ‘A lot of people think that David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to catch up with One Nation Labour on the cost-of-living crisis: from pay-day lending to energy bills,’ he will say. ‘But the truth is they are struggling to catch up with the British people who live at the sharp end of an economy where the link between the wealth of our nation and family finances has been broken. That is the cost-of-living crisis that is happening in our country today. ‘That is how this Government and any government will be judged. And it is how the Autumn Statement will be judged.’ Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Minister, said: ‘The Energy Company Obligation is David Cameron’s scheme. He only introduced it this year and a few months ago he was even boasting that it was bigger than previous energy efficiency schemes. ‘Labour has consistently said that ECO should be reformed to make it better value for money and targeted at those in fuel poverty. 'But what the public really needs is a Labour government implementing a price freeze until 2017 and resetting the energy market so that it works for the long term.’","Chancellor gives details of reforms he claims will see £50 shaved off bills .

A unique project to unveil the workings of the brains of a woolly mammoth is underway in Russia following the discovery of a near perfect specimen. The 10-year-old animal which scientists have named Yuka was found superbly preserved in the Siberian permafrost in 2009. Despite being dead for around 39,000 years Yuka's brain was in such good condition that scientists are only recently have researchers disclosed that a full-scale brain mapping exercise is now underway. Delicate work: A team of scientists carefully remove the brain from the skull . Huge interest: Researchers hope they will be able to significantly boost out knowledge of how the woolly mammoths lived . Vital statistics: A scientist measures the base of Yuka the mammoth's skull . Scientists hope that by quite literally getting inside the beast's head they will be able to significantly boost our understanding of the woolly mammoth. Remarkable pictures published in the Siberian Times show the moment scientist carefully removed the brain from Yuka's remains so the analysis could begin. Their initial findings were presented at the 73rd Symposium of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Los Angeles. They claim that the real breakthrough that came when the first CT scan of the cranium was performed at the Republic of Sakha Academy of Sciences, Yakutsk in May 2012. The team at Yakutsk said: 'It unexpectedly revealed the preserved brain with well-defined major gross anatomy features, including frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with gyri, and cerebellum with internal structures, which yielded the first chance to examine woolly mammoth brain morphology. 'The brain extraction was performed based on our own experience combined with the generally used treatment for large mammals, including modern elephants. In tact: Yuka's brain is one of the best-preserved mammoth brains ever discovered as many previous examples have been damaged or shriveled up over the years . Preservation: After removing it from the skull the brain is now stored in formalin solution in Moscow . 'In February 2013, the brain was preserved by the method of flowing fixation developed by Professor Sergei Saveliev (Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (RIHM, RAMS) in Moscow), which included three weeks of continuous preservation of the braincase content only using formalin.' 'After the extraction, the brain was wrapped with fabric for support and placed into formalin solution overnight before being flown to Moscow. It is currently stored in formalin solution at the Research Institute of Human Morphology'. Early research results confirm the mammoth has a similar brain structure to that of the modern elephant but the team are keen to point out that more research is needed. Crucially the scientist have been able to identify the main functional areas of the brain and so are able to look forward to a point where they can create a 'brain atlas' for the animal. On tour: Yuka's body is now doing a tour of the world's top museums where the public has been flocking to see her . Future: Scientists are now hopeful they will be able to create 'brain atlas' for the woolly mammoth . This is to take place in Moscow at the Institute of Human Morphology under the guidance of Professor Saveliev. A report by Professor Albert Protopopov and colleagues explained the significance of the new project which he says will  help us 'to understand particular aspects of their behaviour'. It says: 'This discovery holds great scientific significance. This is the first time scientists have got their hands on the brain of an animal that lived tens of thousands of years ago, and one that is in such good condition.' But while Yuka's brains are being keenly examined by scientists her body is proving to be equally anticipated by tourists who flock to see her as she continues a tour of the world's top museums which this week takes her to Taiwan.","The remains of 10-year-old Yuka were discovered in Siberia in 2009 and offers one the most complete example of a woolly mammoth brain ever found .

The red poppy, the symbol of remembrance, is disappearing from British fields as it has become one of the nation’s fastest declining plant species. Powerful new herbicides and modern farming techniques have seen it almost completely wiped from fields, a study has found. The flower is now only found on rough ground, hedgerows and in gardens. Disappearing from British fields: The red poppy has become one of the nation's fastest declining plant species . Plantlife, which campaigns for the protection of wild plants, found that the poppy is one of more than 500 wild flowers that are now considered threatened or rare in England. Nicola Hutchinson, who wrote the report, said: ‘Despite its iconic status, our symbol of remembrance could face its own battle if action isn’t taken. ‘As Britain prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, the sad fact is that the much loved red poppy now belongs to our fastest declining group of plants. ‘England’s farmland is rapidly becoming the domain of a few species where once there was abundant diversity, with increased intensification resulting in wild flowers such as poppy being squeezed out of the landscape. Iconic: The flower is widely recognised as the symbol of remembrance . ‘Of the 1,556 flowers in the British flora, 580 are considered threatened or rare in England. As they disappear, so the colour is wiped from our countryside. The England Farmland Report warned that on average one species of flower is lost from each county every year. ‘Corn buttercups, purple milk vetch, red hemp nettle and Venus looking glass are vanishing; those left cling on to fragments of a countryside that is becoming nothing more than green concrete,’ it said. Plantlife is calling for the European Union common agricultural policy (CAP) to include increased protections for wild flowers. ‘When the First World War broke out, farmland flowers like poppies, corn buttercups and purple milk vetch were abundant across Britain. Today they are still amongst our most loved species but belong to our most threatened group of flowers,’ the report said. ‘Many species have gone from prolific to rare within a few decades. Across the country we are losing species that have been locally present for centuries. ‘Changes in farming practices, including the increased use of herbicides and inorganic fertilisers, breeding of more competitive crop varieties, seed-cleaning and changes from predominately spring sown cropping to autumn cropping, have taken their toll. ‘We hope the government will make the right decision on CAP and agri-environment funding. ‘Negotiations within the EU have reached a tipping point and the next Common Agricultural Policy is being settled over the forthcoming months. It is imperative that environment measures within the Rural Development Programme for England protect this unrivalled natural and cultural heritage.’","The red poppy has become one of Britain's fastest declining plant species .

'Different': Bijan Ebrahimi was murdered by his neighbour after police wrongfully arrested him for taking pictures of children . The eldest sister of Bijan Ebrahimi, the innocent man killed when he was wrongly accused of being a paedophile, has said her brother died a 'terrible death' for being different. The 52-year-old woman, who has asked to remain anonymous to protect her family, has spoken of her family's distress following the death of Mr Ebrahimi last year. The NHS nurse spoke said her brother suffered years of racist abuse before being killed by his neighbours because 'he was not like them'. Speaking to The Observer she said: 'A rumour was spread about Bijan that wasn't true. 'People . need to understand the consequences when such allegations are made. 'His only 'crime' was that, for some people, . he was not like them. 'Why should that lead to such a terrible death?' Iranian Mr Ebrahimi, 44, moved to the UK in 2000. He was a trained plumber and carpenter, but was registered disabled and unable to work. In July last year, he was arrested by police following false complaints he had been taking pictures of children near to his home in an estate in Brislington, Bristol. Avon and Somerset police said a charge of paedophilia was completely unfounded and the man returned to his home. It has since emerged that he was taking pictures of children damaging his plants. Following the arrest, neighbour Lee James, 24, burst into Mr Ebrahimi's home, threatening him before dragging him outside. James stamped on his head until he died before setting him alight. His burnt body was . found just 100 yards from his maisonette. Tragically, when he was murdered, he had been due to go on a family holiday - but his passport had expired. On Thursday, James received a life sentence for the murder and will serve at least 18 years. Another man, Stephen Norley, 25, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender and was given a four-year sentence. The judge called the crime an 'act of murderous injustice'. Crime: Lee James, pictured left, pleaded . guilty to the murder of Bijan Ebrahim while Stephen Norley, pictured . right,  pleaded guilty to assisting an offender . In the interview, the woman described a clash of cultures between her brother and several residents of the estate. She said her brother - a Muslim - clashed with certain neighbours, in particular James, who would hold loud parties where drink and drugs were allegedly consumed. She said Mr Ebrahimi, who considered leaving the estate five years ago to live with his sister when her husband died, also suffered racist abuse from some of his neighbours over several years. The woman spoke of her distress at the fact that her brother had called police the night before he died asking for assistance - saying he trusted the force who ultimately left him unprotected. An Independent Police Complaints . Commission (IPCC) Investigation has been launched in the wake of . the attack. Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan issued an apology after the tragedy, saying: 'Mr Ebrahimi was someone who deserved the protection of all of us and we are very sorry about what happened to him. Wrongly accused: Mr Ebrahimi was attacked outside this building where he lived in Bristol . 'It is clear that there was a collective . failure on the part of statutory agencies and others to protect Mr . Ebrahimi and we cannot wait for all the various external investigative . processes to run their course before we start learning lessons for the . future. 'We need to have some frank and candid local discussions with our partners and our communities about what we collectively can do to stop this happening again. 'Senior people in our own organisation have already put in place urgent actions to improve the way we respond to the vulnerable, handle reports of anti-social behaviour and identify repeat callers and victims and we will continue to talk to partners to improve the way we work together to protect the public.' Loved-one: Manizhah Moores, sister of Bijan Ebrahimi, speaks to the press after the sentencing of Stephen Norley and Lee James at Bristol Crown Court . The IPCC said six police officers and six civilian communications staff had been interviewed by investigators. Three Pcs have been interviewed under caution on suspicion of misconduct in public office, while an inspector, sergeant and a constable - who dealt with Mr Ebrahimi while in custody - have been interviewed for gross misconduct. The investigation against the inspector has since ceased. A control room supervisor, a dispatcher and four call handlers who dealt with phone calls from Mr Ebrahimi have also been interviewed for gross misconduct. Mr Ebrahimi's younger sister Manizhah Moores made an emotional statement about her brother's background and the distress her family have felt subsequently outside court. She said: 'Burning Bijan's body took away the opportunity for us to pay our respects to our brother as we could not view his body before he was laid to rest. 'To us this felt like Bijan being murdered twice. 'The loss of Bijan has left a hole in our lives that we can never fill. Our life will never be the same again.'","Bijan Ebrahimi wrongly accused of taking photographs of children .

Schoolchildren are prostituting themselves in one in seven Italian high schools, a new survey has found. Students as young as 14 are selling their bodies to classmates on a regular basis at nine per cent of schools in Italy. Meanwhile, isolated incidents of child prostitution have occurred at a further five-and-a-half per cent of institutions. Shocking: Schoolchildren are prostituting themselves in one in seven Italian high schools (posed by models) The shocking statistics were revealed in an online poll by student website Skuola.net. About 3,000 Italian schoolchildren took part in the survey - with students in a staggering 14 per cent of schools admitting to prostituting themselves. Nearly 40 per cent of students claimed prostitution didn't occur at their school - while 46.5 per cent said they didn't know whether it happened, according to The Local. Results: Students in a staggering 14 per cent of schools admit to selling themselves to classmates in exchange for sex (posed by model) Alarmingly, of those who knew about child prostitution, a quarter admitted to having numerous sexual encounters with female students in exchange for money. A further five per cent confessed to having a single encounter with a child prostitute. And almost nine per cent of schoolchildren said that, although they hadn’t yet paid for a prostitute, they would like to. Italy is not the only country where child prostitution has become an issue in recent years. In Indonesia, children as young as 11 are being sold for sex by teenagers barely older than themselves. Last month, the National . Commission for Child Protection said 21 girls aged between 14 and 16 had . been caught working as 'mamis' in the country so far this year. Many had been drawn into child prostitution by the lure of money or drug addiction. And today, MailOnline revealed that underage girls are sold for sex every ten miles along Brazil's BR-116 highway - often for as little as £8.","Child prostitution occurs in 14.4 per cent of high schools in Italy .

Andrew Mitchell launched an astonishing attack on the Metropolitan Police over the Plebgate affair last night – after a 12-month inquiry concluded there was insufficient evidence that a Number 10 police officer had lied. The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland – with whom he clashed in Downing Street – branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word ‘plebs’ on oath. Mr Mitchell flatly denies claims by the officer that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street’s gates last September. Andrew Mitchell (pictured with his wife Dr Sharon Bennett) has said he ntends to bring PC Rowland to 'justice' and re-instate his reputation . His denunciation came as prosecutors yesterday decided a single officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation, which involved taking more than 1,100 statements. PC Keith Wallis, 53, was charged with misconduct in a public office over allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row. Five officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group, including Wallis, will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct, meaning they could lose their jobs. Three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings. related] . But, crucially, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to show that PC Rowland, 43, lied about what had happened. Nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry. Mr Mitchell claimed the police had failed to even interview PC Rowland as a suspect about what happened. And he accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe of prematurely clearing his officers of wrongdoing. Mr Mitchell said: ‘PC Toby Rowland, who was responsible for writing those toxic phrases into his notebook, was not telling the truth. 'I will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention to ensure that PC Toby Rowland has similarly to swear his account. ‘I understand that PC Toby Rowland has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry.’ The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland - with whom he clashed in Downing Street - branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word 'plebs' on oath . In a statement, PC Rowland said last night: ‘I stand by my account of events in Downing Street on 19th September 2012. 'This has now been thoroughly investigated and the CPS has confirmed there is insufficient evidence to take any criminal proceedings against me. ‘In addition, neither am I subject to any disciplinary proceedings. 'I confirm that I am prepared to give evidence under oath if required.’ Mr Mitchell is suing The Sun newspaper, which printed the original report, for libel and said he believed the paper would have to call PC Rowland to corroborate the paper’s account, forcing him to give evidence on oath. Scotland Yard said PC Rowland was interviewed under ‘police misconduct regulations’ – not under police caution. But it added his statement could have been used against him had he been charged with criminal or internal disciplinary offences. The announcement by new Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders fell far short of the result that Mr Mitchell had sought if he is to resume his cabinet career. She said: ‘We have considered all of the evidence in this case, including previously unseen, unedited CCTV footage from Downing Street, not referred to by the media. 'Taking it all into account, including the accounts of the officer at the gate of Downing Street and that of Andrew Mitchell MP before, during and after the incident, we have found that there is insufficient evidence to show that the officer at the gate lied in his account. ‘The CPS has also found that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Mitchell was the victim of a conspiracy of misinformation.’ Her lawyers also found that a jury would be likely to decide that the leaking of an email in the affair was in the public interest, a finding that could undermine Mr Mitchell’s attempt to sue the Sun. Sir Bernard said: ‘This investigation has been a ruthless search for the truth as at the heart of this are extremely damaging allegations that officers have lied and falsified statements against a Cabinet Minister.’ A Channel 4 documentary into the Plebgate affair has been called into question by the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Last December’s programme – hailed by Andrew Mitchell and his supporters – appeared to cast doubt on the officers’ account of what happened. It revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate of Downing Street at the time of the altercation as had originally been claimed. Mr Mitchell at the gate where he clashed with the officer. He flatly denies claims that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street's gates last September . But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who succeeded Keir Starmer QC earlier this month, said the programme ‘showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards’. She said in her 1,800-word statement on Plebgate: ‘Much of the press reporting to date has assumed that the CCTV recordings show that the gate officer lied about the words used during the incident. ‘The CCTV footage that has been aired publicly was edited and did not show the full picture. ‘We have been supplied with previously unseen and unedited footage of the incident from five different cameras. The CCTV footage does not determine the issue completely as it could be consistent with either the accounts of the officer on the gate or Mr Mitchell. ‘It is clear from the footage that there was sufficient time for the words to have been said either as described by the gate officer or as described by Mr Mitchell, and this has been confirmed by an expert.’ A Channel 4 spokesman defended its journalism on Plebgate. He said: ‘The CCTV footage was obtained by Andrew Mitchell from Downing Street and provided to Dispatches and Channel  4 News. The footage as broadcast for the first time on 18th December 2012 was not edited by the production team to change or alter the sequence of events. ‘Furthermore the three camera angles that we were provided with were image-matched frame by frame to confirm their veracity. We stand fully behind this investigation.’ At his televised press conference yesterday, Mr Mitchell made clear his appreciation of the Channel 4 documentary, and selected Michael Crick, Channel 4 News’s political correspondent – with whom he enjoys a strong professional relationship – to ask him the first question from the floor.

Power firms will be forced to 'come clean' about their costs and the profits that they make under reforms designed to drive down bills, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister revealed government plans to impose 'total transparency’ on competition among the Big Six companies, which account for 99 per cent of UK homes. It will also be made easier and quicker for people to switch between energy suppliers, with ministers hoping firms will have to offer better deals to attract and retain customers. Warning: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Big Six energy firms had to open up their books to scrutiny . Households will be promised clearer bills while the government carries out an annual review of competition in the sector. Pressure has grown in the government to act as the latest round of pre-winter price hikes got under way. Mr Clegg called on the firms to ‘come clean’ about how they were passing on the costs to customers. ‘I would say to the Big Six that it's . time that they opened their books, it's time that they were straight . with people, it's time that they levelled with their customers,’ he . added. David Cameron also told MPs today: ‘What we need in the energy market is more competition and lower levies and charges to drive profits and prices down.’ Review: Energy Secretary Ed Davey will set out plans for an annual competition review in a statement to the Commons tomorrow . Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. E.ON boss Tony Cocker today hinted that its prices will also rise, warning: ‘Fundamentally things in the energy mix keep driving costs up.' Critics accuse the big firms of behaving like a monopoly, all putting their prices up at the same time by the same amount. Tomorrow Energy Secretary Ed Davey will use a statement to the Commons to set out plans for the annual review of competition. If it is found to be not working, the government could intervene to make it easier for smaller rivals to get a foothold in the market. He will also promise to force companies to make their bills clearer, so customers can understand how much energy they use and what they are being charged for. Ministers also want to make it easier for customers to switch between firms, copying reforms agreed with the banking industry which allows people to change current accounts within seven days. However there is no coalition agreement on the future of green levies, which David Cameron has vowed to ‘roll back’. Mr Clegg has suggested that some charges on bills used for environmental schemes or those helping the vulnerable to stay warm could be paid for out of general taxation. But Tory energy minister Michael Fallon today insisted this was just ‘one idea’ being considered and there was no ‘specific target’ for how much the Government hoped to reduce the levies by. The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . Companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £60 if the green taxes were scrapped. But Mr Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, today he has not ‘done the arithmetic to see what the total picture is’. Mr Clegg said discussions with the Prime Minister over green levies would continue until December. He . told reporters at his monthly press conference: ‘I certainly don't want . to throw the poorest in this land to the wolves by some hasty, . ill-thought through change. Energy firm Npower has already unveiled plans for clearer bills so customers can more easily see what gas and electricity they have used . ‘I also want to protect the thousands of jobs in the booming green energy sector and I want to ensure that the investment flows into our energy infrastructure so we continue to create those jobs but also keep the lights on in the future and we don't turn our back on the environment. ‘Those are the objectives, those are the ends that I think we should absolutely stick to but of course I'm very pragmatic about making sure that, if we can deliver those ends through means which are less costly, then of course we should look at that.’ The Deputy Prime Minister attacked the energy companies, claiming it was ‘totally implausible’ that bill hikes were being caused by green levies, and adding that the proportion it accounted for in terms of costs was unchanged from last year. Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow energy minister, said: 'Hard-pressed energy customers struggling with the cost of living need action now, not the promise of another review in future led by the same regulator that has let the energy companies get away with ripping people off. 'Nothing less than a price freeze will do, because this is the only way we can deal with the energy companies overcharging. 'Labour's energy freeze will save money for 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses and our plans to reset the market will deliver fairer prices in the future. People are sick and tired of paying over the odds because David Cameron is too weak to stand up to the energy companies.'","Annual competition review will examine if energy market is working .

He might look like an extra member of Daft Punk, but Russia’s robot humanoid is set to be joining astronauts aboard the International Space Station as early as next year. Scientists at the Gagarin Cosmonauts' Training Centre in Star City Centre, just outside Moscow, have shown off their creation, called SAR-401. Russia is working on its own version of Nasa’s Robonaut, which is already lending a hand on the International Space Station – so the two robots might work together in the future. Russia's SAR-401robot humanoid could be joining astronauts aboard the International Space Station as early as next year . A slightly earlier model called SAR-400 is scheduled to be blasted into space in 2014. Russia’s robonaut is similar to Nasa’s as it is not designed to be completely autonomous but is operated remotely from the ground, Spectrum reported. A Russian scientist demonstrated how by putting on a pair of specially designed gloves, he is able to control the robot’s arms and hands, which are based on a human’s and can perform delicate tasks. Scientists at the Gagarin Cosmonauts' Training Centre in Star City Centre, just outside Moscow, have shown off their creation, which has human-like hands to perform dextrous tasks demanded of astronauts . The robot can lift up to 10 kilograms on Earth, though it will be able to lift more than that in a zero-gravity environment. It is capable of operating inside or outside the space station. Oleg Gordiyenko, science directorate deputy head at the Gagarin Cosmonauts' Training Centre Research Institute, said: ‘It's to perform operations both aboard the ISS and outside. ‘Scientists' plans envision introducing robots in manned cosmonautics. This is a promising avenue of research for coming years.’ A Russian scientist demonstrated how he is able to control the robot's arms and hands by putting on a pair of specially designed gloves . The robonaut's hands are capable of manipulating small items and lifting heavy objects . The robot has been built by Android Technics and the company’s executive director, Vladislav Sychkov, said: ‘We have completed R&D for the development of the robot’s new key assembly unit, which is a ""shoulder"" with three degrees of freedom. ‘We’re also working on a new pickup and gripping system. All this is expected to result in the creation of a prototype of a multifunctional space robot.’ He told Russian publication RIA Novosti (via Marchmont Innovation News) there is no need for the robot to have legs and it focuses on a torso and two  ‘manipulator arms’ as well as a head module. Nasa's Robonaut 2 also has hands, upper body and a head, which has cameras that work like eyes . SAR-400 is planned to join Nasa’s Robonaut 2 at the International Space Station, which has also been built to look a little like a person. Robonaut 2 also has a head, upper body and hands. Its head has cameras that work like eyes, as well as moving fingers that can manipulate the same tools as astronauts. The robot can lift up to 10 kilograms on Earth, but this translates into lifting objects that weigh more in space, as the robot is designed to be able to work outside the space station too . Its upper body can be placed on different lower halves, including a set of wheels. The robot works in two ways: It either receives a simple job to do and uses an onboard computer to work out how to perform the task, or can be run by remote control by a person wearing a headset, who can see what the robots sees and then control it from Earth. Robonaut is a humanoid robotic development project conducted by the Dextrous Robotics Laboratory at Nasa's Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. It is designed to work alongside astronauts and has dexterous hands to use space tools and work in similar environments suited to astronauts. Robonaut 2 is capable of speeds more than four times faster than the first model, is more compact, more dexterous and includes a deeper and wider range of sensing. There are over 350 sensors and 38 PowerPC processors in the robot. Station crew members can operate R2, as well as controllers on the ground using 'telepresence,' which is a set of technologies that allow a person to feel as if they are present at a place other than their true location, using telerobotics. The robot doesn't have to be fully supervised and can carry out tasks autonomously with supervision checks. While not all human range of motion and sensitivity has been duplicated, the robot's hand has 12 degrees of freedom as well as 2 degrees of freedom in wrist. The R2 model also uses touch sensors at the tips of its fingers. The robot arrived on the International Space Station on August 22, 2011. Further upgrades could be added to allow R2 to work outside in the vacuum of space, where R2 could help space walkers perform repairs, make additions to the station or conduct scientific experiments.

"The scientists believe the same process . may be used by all mushroom fungi, including those that cause diseases . in plants, animals and humans . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:00 EST, 25 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 26 November 2013 . Mushrooms have an extraordinary ability to control the weather, scientists have learned. By altering the moisture of the air around them, they are able to whip up winds that blow away their spores and help them disperse. Plants use a variety of methods to spread seeds, including gravity, forceful ejection, wind, water and animals. Scientists used high-speed filming techniques and mathematical modelling to show how oyster and Shitake mushrooms (pictured) release water vapour to cools the air around them, creating convection currents . Mushrooms have long been thought of as passive seed spreaders, releasing their spores and then relying on air currents to carry them. But new research has shown that mushrooms are able to disperse their spores over a wide area even when there is not a breath of wind - by creating their own 'weather'. U.S. scientists used high-speed filming techniques and mathematical modelling to show how oyster and Shitake mushrooms release water vapour to cool the air surrounding them, creating convection currents. The scientists believe the same process may be used by all mushroom fungi, including those that cause diseases in plants, animals and humans (puffball fungus, pictured) This in turn generates miniature winds that lift their spores into the air. The findings, presented at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics in Pittsburgh, suggest that mushrooms are far more than mechanical spore manufacturers. 'Our research shows that these ""machines"" are much more complex than that: they control their local environments, and create winds where there were none in nature,' said lead scientist Professor Emilie Dressaire, from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. 'That's pretty amazing, but fungi are ingenious engineers.' The scientists believe the same process may be used by all mushroom fungi, including those that cause diseases in plants, animals and humans. A mushroom - or toadstool - is technically the fleshy, spore-bearing, fruiting body of a fungus. Millions of spores, microscopic single-celled 'seeds', may be produced by a single mushroom, and at least a few of these are likely to land somewhere suitable for fungal growth. More than 80 different types of wild edible mushroom grow in the UK, as well as many poisonous species. One of the world's deadliest mushrooms, the death cap, is a common sight in British woodland. Although pleasant tasting, just one ounce of the fungus is enough to kill. A fungus is neither a plant nor an animal. It is similar to a plant, but it has no chlorophyll so cannot make its own food like a plant can through photosynthesis (the process by which a plant produces energy from exposure to sunlight) Fungi are thought to have diverged from the plant and animal kingdoms about one billion years ago. They obtain their food by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings. Some fungi cause disease by using living organisms for food. These fungi infect plants, animals and even other fungi. Athlete’s foot and ringworm are two fungal diseases in humans. Fungi exist in various habitats, including the depths of the oceans, lakes, deserts, very salty environments and areas of extremely high or low temperatures. Some can survive even after being exposed to intense UV and cosmic radiation as one would encounter during space travel. Indeed during the 13 years the Mir space station was in orbit, a great deal of equipment was continuously being damaged by mutated fungi that had been breeding in the space station.","Researchers found that oyster and Shitake mushrooms release water vapour that cools the air around them, creating convection currents .

An ‘extremely rare’ board game piece from the seventh century has been unearthed that casts raucous Anglo Saxon feasts in a new light. The draughts piece was discovered in the foundations of a royal great hall in Lyminge, Kent, and archaeologists believe it shows a more cerebral side to Anglo Saxon festivities, which are thought to have involved a great deal of mead drinking. It is made from a hollow cylinder of bone that has been smoothed with lathe-turned end caps and secured with a small bronze rivet in the centre. The games piece is made from a hollow cylinder of bone that has been smoothed with lathe-turned end caps and secured with a small bronze rivet in the centre . The games piece is the first to be found away from a burial site and the first of its kind to be discovered for 130 years. Experts from the University of Reading believe it would have been used for a game similar to that of backgammon or draughts. The Anglo Saxons had a strong tradition of playing board games and individual gaming pieces - and sometimes complete sets - have been discovered in burials of the period. However the fact the piece was discovered in a ‘gaming setting', an Anglo Saxon royal hall, suggests the people at the time played board games while enjoying the kind of lively feasts described in Beowulf. The draughts piece was discovered in the foundations of a royal great hall in Lyminge, Kent (pictured) and archaeologists believe it casts show a more cerebral side to Anglo Saxon festivities, which are thought to have involved a great deal of mead drinking . It is difficult to establish the precise nature of the games played, but archaeological evidence from the Germanic continent, the cultural home of the Anglo Saxons, provides clues, according to the archaeologists. Both 'tabula', a form of backgammon, and 'latrunculi', a board game similar to checkers, can be traced to these regions and were likely transported to England during the fifth century as a consequence of Anglo Saxon migrations. Dr Gabor Thomas and his team at the university also uncovered items of jewellery, numerous fragments of luxury vessel glass and pits with animal bones, confirming that feasting and social display were integral to Lyminge's role as a place of royal ceremonial events and gatherings during the late 6th and 7th centuries. Dr Thomas said: ‘Our excavation is providing an unprecedented picture of life in an Anglo Saxon royal complex. Fragments of precious glass vessels are pictured. The glasses were not designed to be stood up like at dinner parties today, but would have been continually passed around and topped up by servants, Dr Thomas said . ‘Gaming, along with feasting, drinking, and music, formed one of the key entertainments of the Anglo Saxon mead-hall as evoked in the poem Beowulf. ‘The discovery of Anglo Saxon gaming pieces and gaming boards has previously been restricted to male burials, particularly those of the Anglo Saxon elite. ‘To find such a well preserved example in the hall, where such board games were actually played, is a wonderfully evocative discovery.’ Much of our understanding of Anglo Saxon socialising comes from the epic poem Beowulf, where feasts are described as being mead drinking marathons, where drinks were spilled as glass cups had round bottoms and drinking games were played while music was played. Dr Thomas and his team at the university, also uncovered items of jewellery. Archaeologists have described the find, pictured, as a miniature radiate headed brooch . Dr Thomas told MailOnline that precious glass vessels were not designed to be stood up like at dinner parties today, but would have been continually passed around and topped up by servants. 'They drank to get inebriated but it was a sociable activity... and there was little requirement to put the glasses down.' He said a royal feat would have included plenty of mead and possibly wine and archaeological remains show that lots of meat - particularly suckling pig - would have been on the menu. 'Imagine rich food along with drink and music and heroic poetry being recited - there was a lot going on,' he said. Dr Thomas believes gaming was an important part of the feasts and the king might have played other members of the court and it would have been a competitive activity. The fact the piece was discovered in a 'gaming' setting, an Anglo-Saxon Royal Hall in Lyminge, Kent, suggests the people at the time played board games as well as enjoyed the kind of raucous feats described in Beowulf . 'It was lively and not too different from Christmas parties these days,' he added. Lyminge's royal complex was first discovered in 2012 when an Anglo Saxon feasting hall was unearthed - the first such building to be excavated in its entirely in over a generation. The researchers discovered a sequence of three timber halls, bearing unusual and highly elaborate architectural features. This included mortar and crushed tile floors previously only seen in the earliest generation of Anglo Saxon churches and massive entrance portals on a scale previously unparalleled in Anglo Saxon England. ‘By combining these fascinating structural remains with a stunning array of artefacts, our excavations are providing new insights into the role played by Anglo Saxon royal complexes in forging kingdoms and royal dynasties during this key period in English history,’ Dr Thomas added.","Archaeologists from the University of Reading found the games piece in the foundations of a royal great hall in Lyminge, Kent .

The report by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, above, was commissioned by the government in a bid to ward off fears of an A&E crisis . A huge shake-up of health care provision was heralded last night by the NHS’s top doctor. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh announced plans for a ‘two-tier’ casualty service with ‘super A&Es’ dealing with life-threatening conditions. But fears are growing that his reforms will only lead to confusion among patients, who will not know which hospital to attend. The three key planks of his reforms will set up distinction between super A&Es and standard A&Es, ask GPs to provide more same-day appointments as well as opening surgeries in the evenings and at weekends and bolster the 111 helpline with more doctors, nurses and pharmacists answering the phone. Sir Bruce’s vision is set out in a report, published today, on how to improve A&E and other ‘urgent care’ such as GP services. The Government asked him last winter to draw it up. In the biggest shake-up in A&E departments for 40 years, up to half of the 140 units in England will be transformed into ‘major emergency centres’. They will provide specialised care for the victims of strokes, heart attacks, suspected brain haemorrhages and other life-threatening conditions. The rest will stay as standard casualty units mainly treating the elderly, broken bones, drunks and less critical patients. But Roger Goss, co-director of Patient Concern, said: ‘This will just confuse patients even more. Patients don’t know whether they are suffering from a heart attack or a bout of indigestion. ‘A healthcare professional should be telling them, but if they can’t get an appointment with their GP how will they know? The reason there is huge demand in A&E is that GPs have been allowed to operate a nine-to-five service. ‘It strikes me that this report is all about how to provide care at the lowest possible costs rather than being about what’s best for patients.’ Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, above, said he would not shy away from making 'difficult decisions' where the NHS is concerned . And the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents casualty doctors, said that critically-ill patients would have to travel further to super A&Es, potentially delaying their treatment. The shake-up – overseen by Sir Bruce, the NHS’s medical director – has been announced at a time of growing problems for A&E units, which are grappling with soaring numbers of patients and shortages of senior doctors. Within the next three to five years, they will be designated as either ‘emergency centres’ – meaning that essentially they will stay the same – or ‘major emergency centres’, which will deal with the most seriously ill patients. Sir Bruce, who said ‘doing nothing was not an option’, estimates that there will be between 40 and 70 super A&Es. They are most likely to be in hospitals which already have specialised stroke and heart attack centres with top doctors on hand. The report prompted speculation that dozens of the lower-tier A&E units will be downgraded. But Sir Bruce insisted this would not be the case, although patients suffering from life-threatening conditions would be transferred to super A&Es. He added that at this stage there were no plans to close A&E units. ‘A&E is creaking at the seams,’ said Sir Bruce. ‘It’s not broken but it is struggling. ‘In many senses, our A&Es have become victims of their own success because they function as a safety net for people who are worried, frightened, anxious or in pain and therefore have problems that concern them. When A&Es become very busy it means other parts of the system are creaking as well, they are under stress. ‘It’s against that background that there’s a feeling this winter will be difficult.’ Sir Bruce hopes that GPs, paramedics and NHS 111 staff will ensure patients are sent to the most appropriate A&E unit. He also wants to reduce the numbers of patients turning up in casualty by making it easier for them to get a GP appointment and making surgeries stay open during the evening and at weekends. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham, above, said the report does not address the impending crisis . It is not yet clear how he will encourage GPs to work out-of-hours without changing their contracts. The Government is currently holding talks with senior family doctors over changes to their contract, which could see them having to take back responsibility for patients during the evening and at weekends. Sir Bruce also plans to beef-up the NHS 111 helpline and recruit more doctors, nurses and pharmacists to offer expert advice to patients rather than untrained call centre staff. When the helpline started operating in the spring there were concerns it led to more patients turning up in A&E because they were given the wrong advice by staff or gave up in frustration. At present, most patients phoning the number speak to a call-centre worker with limited experience and training who reads through a script. NHS officials want to improve the helpline drastically so that when patients ring it they are given medical guidance that is good enough to mean they do not have to go to hospital. In his report, Sir Bruce says he wants NHS 111 to be ‘the smart call to make’. He also wants to give paramedics more training so they are capable of diagnosing patients on the scene and taking them to a specialist stroke or heart attack centre or just treating them at home. Other plans would see GPs being allowed to admit frail elderly patients straight to care homes rather than sending them to A&E. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Commons yesterday that the Government would not shy away from making ‘difficult decisions’. He said: ‘We all know that the NHS needs to change to meet the needs of an ageing population. The reforms will set up distinction between super A&Es, Sir Bruce Keogh said . ‘We know that change will not happen overnight and we’ll work with NHS England [which runs the health service] to ensure the NHS offers world-class standards of patient care.’ Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said the plans did not address the impending crisis facing many A&E units, which have too few doctors to deal with soaring numbers of patients. ‘Ministers said this report would have lessons for the immediate winter as well as the longer term,’ he said. ‘But they are failing to act and their response remains, “Crisis, what crisis?”. They are forcing A&Es to go into winter with too few nurses, doctors and beds.’","Two-tier system will define 'super A&Es' and 'standard A&Es'

'I know that it was going to be a special year and when we start rolling nobody ever stop the train.' The win capped an emotional season for the Red Sox, one heavy with the reminder of the Boston Marathon bombings in April. Players wore 'Boston Strong' logos on their left sleeves and erected a large emblem on the outfield wall known as the Green Monster as a constant reminder. Fans said the victory felt important - bigger than the team's previous successes. 'We needed this,' after the bombings, said Mark Porcaro of Boston. 'They were an easy team to get behind because they stood up for us when we needed them most.' Bostonian Sam D'Arrigo said: 'Words cannot describe how I feel.

At the University of New Hampshire, 65 miles from Boston in Durham, police used pepper stray to disperse crowds of rowdy students. In the midst of the celebration, Boston's mayor and other officials - wary of some of the rowdiest fans in sports - urged revelers to be safe. Mayor Thomas Menino posted two tweets in 10 minutes urging fans to celebrate 'responsibly.' This is the third world series win for the Red Sox in 10 years. The team broke the 'curse of the Bambino' - a World Series drought since 1918 - in 2004. They won again in 2007. But, both of those titles were seized on the road at their opponents' stadiums. It was back in that cursed year 1918 - . that the Sox last won a World Series in Fenway Park. The historic . ballpark was just six years old then. Now it is the oldest stadium in . all of Major League Baseball. The Sox won the best-of-seven contest in six games - mounting a remarkable comeback since falling behind 2-1 in St. Louis. As . the Red Sox made their run for the World Series, several prominent . players swore off shaving until they won. The famously scruffy players . kicked off a social media sensation with the tagline 'Fear the Beard.' Boston's 2013 team wasn't always favored for such baseball glory. The 2012 Red Sox won fewer than half of their games and came in last place in their division. Tens of thousands of fans gathered outside Fenway after the World Series win.

Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote: 'But here’s the reality, people: The 2013 Red Sox might be really bad.' None of the top baseball analysts picked the Red Sox to win the World Series. The team rallied, though. Ortiz improved his hitting to become more dominant than he has been in years. It also doesn't hurt that the Sox poured $150million into paying players - the third highest in the MLB. On Wednesday night, Shane Victorino, symbolic of these resilient Sox, returned from a stiff back and got Boston rolling with a three-run double off the Green Monster against rookie sensation pitcher Michael Wacha. John Lackey became the first pitcher to start and win a Series clincher for two different teams, allowing one run over 6 2-3 innings 11 years after his Game 7 victory as an Angels rookie in 2002. With fans roaring on every pitch and cameras flashing, Koji Uehara struck out Matt Carpenter for the final out. The Japanese pitcher jumped into the arms of catcher David Ross while Red Sox players rushed from the dugout and bullpen as the Boston theme ""Dirty Water"" played on the public-address system. 'We have a lot of players with heart. We probably don't have the talent that we had in '07 and '04, but we have guys that are capable (of staying) focused and do the little things,' Ortiz said. 'Our f***ing city!' Ortiz was defiant in his remarks after the game and thanks the city of Boston for sticking with the team after the bombings in April .

"By . Jill Foster . PUBLISHED: . 17:51 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:26 EST, 31 October 2013 . Concern: Anne Marie Yates thought she would have to have surgery to treat a prolapse . After Ann Marie Yates gave birth to her first baby in the late Eighties, she received plenty of advice from midwives about how to take care of her newborn, whether it was how to change a nappy or the best way to breastfeed. But it was a throwaway line by one midwife about how a new mum could best take care of her own body which stands out now. 'She told me to do my ""pelvic floor exercises"" - and that was it,' recalls Ann Marie. 'I was never told how to do them or why I must do them, just to do them. 'Of course, when I left hospital I was so busy as a new mother that I completely forgot. No one ever told me how vitally important they were and how they could have saved me from so many problems in the future,' says Ann Marie, now 57 and a divorced mother-of-two. For the first few weeks, new mums are lucky if they have time to brush their hair, let alone do exercise, pelvic or otherwise. Even if they've been reminded to do them by their midwife or health visitor, it’s unlikely they will have been instructed as to the best technique. At best, they might be given a leaflet with a few diagrams at the hospital. Now, a new book claims that even when medical staff do instruct mothers in how to strengthen their pelvic floor, they are a pale imitation of the original treatment that gynaecologist Dr Arnold Kegel devised in the Forties. Mums get told simply to squeeze their internal muscles as if they are trying to hold back a wee. But this only works superficial pelvic floor muscles, not the deeper ones that make a real difference, author Barry Fowler insists. What's more, health experts are failing to recommend a simple device - available on prescription - that can prevent embarrassing problems later in life, such as stress incontinence, where urine leaks when a woman runs, coughs or sneezes. 'Though well-meaning, the exercises recommended by doctors and physiotherapists as a first line of treatment bear little resemblance to the pioneering work done by Dr Arnold Kegel, even though modern pelvic floor exercises bear his name,' says Mr Fowler, author of The Kegel Legacy, 65 Years Of Denial. I felt so isolated. I thought: ""I'll never be able to have sex again"" 'The one thing your doctor or midwife will probably not offer you is an effective post-natal floor rehabilitation programme. This helps restore your pelvic floor muscle, prevent the onset of urinary stress incontinence and restore muscle tone to prevent prolapses.' An estimated seven million women in the UK suffer in silence from stress incontinence. While such problems can afflict new mums, even those who show no signs of weak pelvic floor muscles can develop difficulties decades later. And any woman is susceptible post-menopause because a lack of oestrogen slackens muscles. Furthermore, around 30 to 40 per cent of women will suffer a prolapse in their lifetime, where the uterus or other pelvic organs begin to fall from their normal position. Ann Marie, a therapist from Nantwich, Cheshire, had one last October. 'It was horrendous,' she says. 'I'd suffered from some stress incontinence for several years. But I'd resisted buying pads, as I didn't want to admit it was a problem.' Ann Marie suffered frequent attacks of cystitis, particularly after sex. Her doctor prescribed antibiotics, but Ann Marie knew something else was wrong; it was, she says, as if everything was 'dropping', making even walking difficult. Simple solution: The PelvicToner device helped Ann Marie . Until then, she had enjoyed an active sex life with her boyfriend. 'But I started pushing my partner away because I wondered if sex was making my problem worse, and the pain was excruciating,' she says. After several weeks of this, Ann Marie requested an internal examination and her GP diagnosed a prolapse. She had recently been through the menopause, and the resulting decrease in oestrogen had led to weakness in the vaginal muscles. She says: 'I didn’t want my sex life to be over. I was only 56. But the only option at that stage seemed to be surgery. I felt so isolated. I thought: ""I'll never be able to have sex again."" I refused to go out and I pushed my partner away. It was difficult for him, but luckily we could talk about it. 'I just wish someone had told me the importance of doing pelvic floor exercises, especially before the menopause. But even doctors don’t realise their significance.' Author Barry Fowler says Ann Marie’s experiences are typical. 'According to a survey of GP practices in 2012, 62  per cent of women seeking help for pelvic floor-related problems were given a leaflet,' he says. 'It doesn't take a genius to see why seven million women still suffer from stress incontinence, and the number is rising dramatically. 'This has created a multi-billion-pound industry to manage the symptoms of embarrassing leaks while the basic cause is left untreated.' Shelley Perfect, 28, a full-time mum  of four from Wyndham in Norfolk, began to realise something was amiss after the birth of her first son when she was 19. The exercises take eight minutes a day. It took a little while for my sex life to take off again, but now it's fantastic . 'I'd had a problematic birth,' she says. 'I had an episiotomy where the doctors cut me to let the baby out, and afterwards I felt really heavy in that part of my body.' When Shelley left hospital, the midwife gave her a leaflet about pelvic floor exercises, but she couldn't work out which muscles she was supposed to be tensing. 'After I had my second son, I began leaking. I was only 22 but had to wear incontinence pads if I was going to the gym or doing anything that involved jumping around. 'Even sneezing or coughing would make me leak. It was so embarrassing and awful. Then, after I had my third son, my husband Duncan mentioned that he couldn't feel the muscles inside me when we made love. He was getting no sensation. 'I felt absolutely mortified. That put me off sex completely and I became very depressed. Duncan's very supportive, but it felt as if he was saying: ""You're rubbish in bed."" I was worried he'd go off with someone else.’ More help needed: According to a survey of GP practices in 2012, 62 per cent of women seeking help for pelvic floor-related problems were only given a leaflet (posed by models) According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 64 per cent of women suffer from sexual problems six months after childbirth. But fewer than two in three actually consult a doctor. Shelley did, but says: 'The NHS system was rubbish. I asked my doctor about pelvic floor exercises, but he couldn’t explain them properly. So I asked my midwife, who told me to try to pull in the muscles you use when you try to stop weeing. 'I could do that, but I’ve since found out that this does not tighten the correct muscles.' According to recent clinical research, only a third of women are able to locate the correct muscle, known as the pubococcygeus (PC). 'Many women who believe they are doing their Kegels are, in fact, only engaging their abdominals, buttocks or inner thighs,' says Mr Fowler. Pelvic floor exercises are often called Kegel exercises after Dr Arnold Kegel, who developed them in 1948 . In 1948, Dr Kegel invented the perineometer to strengthen the PC muscle. One section looked a bit like a rubber squash ball which a woman squeezed internally. It was connected to a pressure gauge, allowing a doctor to advise whether she was working her muscles hard enough. Several modern, simpler, portable devices are available, but the one Mr Fowler has developed - the PelvicToner - is the only one available on prescription. It's impossible to exercise properly without such a device, as the resistance they provide is the only way to work the deeper muscles. It was the PelvicToner that helped Shelley. 'I'd started researching surgery options which was drastic and expensive,' she says. 'But then I saw a television programme where they were testing out these devices. 'I bought one on the internet and noticed a difference within weeks. Duncan could feel a difference within a month.' For Ann Marie, too, the device has provided a new lease of life. 'None of the doctors I saw mentioned I could get one on the NHS,' she says. 'Instead, I bought one. 'Not long after I started using it, I paid to see a private consultant, who  said: ""Whatever you're doing, keep doing it, because it's working."" ' 'The exercises take eight minutes a day. It took a little while for my sex life to take off again, but now it's fantastic. I even went to a gig recently where I was able to jump up and down with no problems. 'Women are told that leaking is just a normal part of growing older, but it doesn't have to be like that.'","Estimated 7m women in the UK suffer from stress incontinence .

The self-styled viscount conned his mother-in-law out of £150,000 while posing as a shipping magnate . A self-styled viscount who conned his mother-in-law out of £150,000 while posing as a shipping magnate was jailed for 40 months. Kirk Brown, 46, changed his name by deed poll to Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia and claimed he was due a £400m inheritance, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Pretending to own a shipping firm, the fantasist persuaded his wife's mother, Nicola Young, to plough £150,000 into the non-existent business. He also convinced his wife's uncle, Richard Birch, to transfer a total of £116,000 into bogus ventures - one involving a Bulgarian ‘whizz-kid’ stock-broker. Brown convinced his wife's family he was the scion of an obscure European royal family and invented ridiculous excuses when his scheme failed. The ‘grandiose’ cheat once claimed that an employee had emptied the contents of his bank account and donated it to the Taliban, the court heard. Prosecutor Robert Hutchinson described how Brown used the title of viscount, ‘purporting to be a member of a royal family’. ‘He married Miss Jodie Young, the daughter of Mrs Young, and obviously knew his mother-in-law pretty well. ‘What Mr Birch fell for on this occasion was the plausibility of the defendant’s story, because of the link to his niece. ‘The money came into a offshore account which he had called ‘Bessarabia Sovereign Holdings’. ‘There was always some difficulty and it was never the defendant who was to blame.’ Mr Birch and Mrs Young were sent faked bank statements by Brown in order to allay their fears. ‘It was a PDF document. Upon inspection of that PDF document it turned out that the defendant was the author of that file. Later, he told Mr Birch that an employee ‘had embezzled all the money and sent it to the Taliban'. Judge John Hillen said Brown’s 'manipulation, the false documentation that you created, the many lies, the many deceptions, [and] the many pretenses' in his  £266,000 scam meant prison was inevitable. ‘You had assumed the identity of a grandiose aristocrat, even a royal personage. ‘You lived a lie as, you yourself acknowledge. ‘At what point your life became a lie is not clear. It may have been at a very young age. ‘You had certainly assumed this grandiose position of an aristocrat or royal personage and you did so in order to deceive, to lie, to control and to manipulate the family of the woman which you were married to. ‘The sentence will be concurrent on each of the four charges - one of 40 months imprisonment’, the judge said.

Britain has one of the largest Roma populations in Western Europe - with about 200,000 living here - says an authoritative report. The study contradicts Government claims that ‘relatively few Roma citizens’ had set up home in this country. Most are thought to have arrived in the last ten years. The 200,000 figure is four times the 49,000 estimated just four years ago in a report prepared for the Department of Children School and Families. Figures: Local residents outside an apartment block in a slum inhabited by Roma people in Baia Mare, Romania. Britain has one of the largest Roma populations in Western Europe - with about 200,000 living here . Some 183,000 have set up home in England, with 3,000 in Scotland, 900 in Wales, and 500 in Northern Ireland. The findings come amid concerns about how many more migrants will arrive when restrictions on workers from Romania and Bulgaria are relaxed in January. It is claimed most of the migrants have arrived since a number of eastern European countries, including Slovakia and the Czech Republic, joined the European Union in 2004. The latest study, conducted by the University of Salford and seen by Channel 4 News, concluded the migrant Roma population in Britain was ‘significant’, increasing, and that 200,000 was almost certainly a ‘conservative estimate’. As well as London, Yorkshire, the North West and the Midlands are identified as areas where large numbers of Roma live. According to Channel 4 News, Sheffield has seen a big influx of Roma families over the last ten years. Popular: Sheffield has seen a big influx of Roma families over the last ten years, according to Channel 4 News . A decade ago, only one or two were living in the Page Hall area of the city.

A TV newsreader was subjected to vile racist and sexist abuse after she decided not to wear a poppy during a  bulletin on Armistice Day. Charlene White began receiving offensive Twitter messages hours after the ITV news programme was screened on Monday. The tweets from internet trolls labelled her a ‘black ****’ and a ‘fat ****’ – and some even told the London-born journalist, whose Jamaican father served in the RAF, to ‘go back to where you came from’. Scroll down for video . Abuse: Charlene White received racist and sexist messages for not wearing a poppy on ITV News London . One posted: ‘You don’t deserve to sit in front of the British public. Talk about disrespect! Disgraceful.’ The abusive messages came to light yesterday after Miss White, 35, wrote a response on the ITV website. The presenter, who is the patron of several charities, including Bowel Cancer UK, said she didn’t want to be seen to favour the Royal British Legion over others, so avoided wearing a poppy while on screen. Miss White, who joined ITN in 2008 and reads the ITV London News and occasional national bulletins, said: ‘In the last few days I’ve been subjected to a torrent of racist and sexist abuse as a result of me choosing not to wear a poppy on screen, while presenting for ITV News. Defence: Ms White says she is a strong supporter of military veterans but values freedom of expression . ‘It was a decision I made a number of . years ago, but the backlash this year has been far bigger and more . widespread than in previous years. ‘I support, and am a patron of, a . number of charities and I am uncomfortable with giving one of those . charities more on-screen time than others. I prefer to be neutral and . impartial on screen so that one of those charities doesn’t feel less . favoured than another. ‘Off screen in my private life, it’s different. I wear a red ribbon at the start of December for World Aids Day, a pink ribbon in October during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a badge in April during Bowel Cancer Awareness Month and – yes – a poppy on Armistice Day.’ Symbolic: But Ms White said that no one should be forced to wear a poppy in November . Miss White joins other high-profile newsreaders to take the decision not to wear a poppy on screen, including Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow, who has denounced ‘poppy fascism’. Last night, a spokesman for the Royal British Legion echoed his views, adding: ‘We take the view that the poppy represents sacrifices made in the defence of freedom, so the decision to wear it must be a matter of personal choice. If the poppy became compulsory it would lose its meaning and significance.’ A spokesman for ITV News said: ‘A majority of our journalists choose to wear a poppy. We take the view that it is up to each individual to decide if they wish to wear a poppy or not. ‘We don’t impose a requirement on our team to wear poppies for the programme as a matter of course, nor do we object if they choose to.’","Charlene White of ITV News London says she supports Poppy Appeal but does not want to show bias to any one charity in public .

Christie's did not reveal the buyer of Francis Bacon's three-paneled painting Three Studies Of Lucian Freud, sold for £89 million ($142.4million) on Tuesday. But one person with the necessary financial clout and love of the artist is Roman Abramovich. The Russian billionaire and owner of Chelsea football club paid £43 million ($86.3 million) for 'Triptych, 1976' in 2008 - previously the highest amount paid for a Bacon work. Bidding during the November 12 auction of Three Studies Of Lucian Freud at Christie's in New York . Expensive: Francis Bacon's three-paneled painting Three Studies Of Lucian Freud, pictured, became the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction on Tuesday when it soared to $142.4 million at Christie's . Easel does it: Triptych 1976, by Francis Bacon (1909-1992), which was bought by Roman Abramovich in 2008 . Auction: The 1969 triptych, never before offered at auction, carried a pre-sale estimate of about $85 million . A spokesman for Mr Abramovich declined to comment, but there is bound to be speculation that the tycoon is the mystery buyer. According to The New York Times, the work was sold to Manhattan art dealer William Acquavellam, a specialist in 19th and 20th century art, who bought it for an unnamed client. The 1969 triptych, never before . offered at auction and which carried a pre-sale estimate of about $85 . million, easily eclipsed the $119.9 million price of Edvard Munch's The .

Art lover: Russian billionaire and Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich . The art work along with one by Andy Warhol were expected to break records, boosting an already surging market for top-tier works. Christie's sale on Tuesday was led by Bacon's 1969 triptych. The jaw-dropping price easily broke the 2008 Bacon record, months before financial markets crashed and sent the art market into a brief decline. Since then, new, deep-pocketed collectors from around the globe have driven prices to record levels. At a recent preview, Christie's head of postwar and contemporary art, Brett Gorvy, noted that collectors from Asia, Russia and the Mideast flush with cash were determined to assemble world-class collections featuring trophy works. New record: The jaw-dropping price easily broke the $86.3 million Bacon, pictured, record set in 2008, months before financial markets crashed and sent the art market into a brief decline . Famed artist: Bacon is one of America's most famed painters. Two of his other works of art are shown left and right . Bacon (1909-1992) was born in Dublin to English parents and moved to London in 1926. Although . he had no formal training as an artist, he started to exhibit his work . in the 1930s and a decade later his angst-ridden paintings of twisted and . mutated forms became a sensation in the artistic community. He died of a heart attack in Madrid in 1992. Today, his work is among the most popular of 20th-century art at auction. In May, Christie's achieved the highest total in the history of auctions when it sold $495 million worth of art at its postwar and contemporary sale. The auction house said Bacon's three-paneled work, which depicts the Dublin-born painter's friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud on a chair, with a view from each side and one face on, was 'a true masterpiece that marks Bacon and Freud's relationship' and their 'creative and emotional kinship.' 'The juxtaposition of radiant sunshine yellow contrasting with the brutal physicality and immediacy of the brushstrokes in this celebrated life-size triptych is what makes Bacon's art so remarkable,' said Francis Outred, the head of European postwar and contemporary art for Christie's. 'This suddenly becomes a very important conversation between two masters,' Outred said in an interview. He noted that Three Studies Of Lucian Freud is one of only two existing full-length triptychs of Freud, a grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, and that the three panels were separated for 15 years in the 1970s before being reunited. Christie's also offering a Warhol Coca-Cola, which carries an estimate of $40 million to $60 million, and a sculpture by Jeff Koons, Balloon Dog (Orange) expected to fetch $35 million to $55 million. On Wednesday, Sotheby's will try to break the $71.7 million record price for a Warhol when if offers the monumental Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), which has an estimated sale price of $60 million to $80 million.","Abramovich paid £43 million ($86.3 million) for Bacon's Triptych, 1976 in 2008 .

The remains of a top secret tiny submarine that could dive deeper than any other vessel and was used in the recovery of the doomed Challenger shuttle have been put on display. The NR-1 sub performed Cold War operations so classified that its 10-man crews remain sworn to secrecy to this day. It had a claw to pick objects off the sea bed - crucial in the days when Americans and Soviets were tapping underground cables - and even went in search of fragments from the Challenger space shuttle, which exploded during blast-off in 1986. NR-1, pictured in 2007, was one of the U.S. Navy's most advanced and secretive submarines. It has since been broken up and parts have gone on display in Groton, Connecticut, where she was first launched in 1969 . NR-1 launched in Groton, Connecticut, in 1969, where it stayed for much of its time until it left service in 2008.

Veterans who served aboard the tiny sub during . the Cold War say it was one of the most fascinating briefs of . their careers - but not even their wives know all the details. Toby Warson, commander . from 1970 to 1973, won a distinguished service medal for a 'hazardous military operation' in the Mediterranean code-named Raccoon Hook. Yet he is forbidden to this day from telling anyone - even officers - what he did to earn it.

The custom-built, one-of-a-kind vessel carried no weapons, measured just 140ft and travelled at just four knots, but held ten men for up to a month at a time. It was a pet project of Admiral Hyman Rickover, the 'father of the nuclear Navy', and contained a custom-built mini nuclear reactor which powered it as deep as 3,000 feet. Once on the sea bed, it had wheels and lights to explore the ocean floor. It was mainly a research sub, but also performed Cold War military missions which remain highly classified. NR-1 missions which have been declassified include an undersea submarine-detection operation and mapping the ocean floor. It was used in 1976 to recover an F-14 fighter which had rolled off the deck of an aircraft . carrier with a newly-developed missile attached to it. Former commander Michael Riegel said the sub's secrets are fascinating - but he has kept them to himself . Yet the slow-moving sub had to be towed to sea by a surface boat to save time, and it was so small that the crew could feel every pitch and roll of the current. The long-suffering men also had to survive on frozen TV dinners, bath once a week with a bucket of . water and burn chlorate candles to produce oxygen to breathe. Former commander Allison J Holifield said: 'Everybody on NR-1 got sick. It was only a matter of whether you were throwing up or not throwing up.'

It's been more than two years since Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs laid down plans for a futuristic new campus and now new images give the closest indication yet as to how the pioneering structure will look. Nicknamed the Apple spaceship because of its vast circular shape, the 175-acre project will feature a man-made forest of more than 7,000 trees and the building itself will take almost quarter of an hour to walk around. The ring-shaped structure was Jobs’ brainchild, yet after his death British designer Jony Ive took the . project on with the help of architect Sir Norman Foster, and now the local council has approved their ambitious plans. Apple has released never-before-seen images, like the one pictured, that give the closest indication yet as to how the firm's new futuristic headquarters will look. Nicknamed the Apple spaceship because of its vast circular shape, the 2.8 million-square-foot Campus 2 project is expected to cost a total of $5 billion . When Jobs first submitted the plans back in 2011 the campus was billed as 'the best office building in the world'. It has taken since then to get approval from the local council and its likely the campus won't be completed until 2016. Reports in April claimed the project had already exceeded its budget by around $2 billion (£1.32bn), pushing the total cost up to around $5 billion (£3.14 billion) and putting it a year behind schedule. Earlier this year Apple was asked to submit new plans with updated landscaping designed, a slightly revised floor layour, renderings, and a bicycle plan, however the overall main design wasn't changed. Under these updated plans, the campus was renamed Apple Campus 2. Appearing as a giant saucer  the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Among the 7,000 trees that will be planted around the campus, the firm intends to plant species that blossom at different times of the year. This includes apple trees, as well as cherry blossoms, plum trees and other fruit trees and bushes similar to the ones pictured . Inside the third-of-a-mile wide building will be 1,000-seater auditorium where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the company's keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion, pictured, that will also be an access point for employees and guests . This room-sized mock-up of the planned new Apple headquarters in Cupertino was released last month before executives submitted their final plans to the council . Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. The new images also show access roads that lead into tunnels that take cars into the underground car park. They also show the parts of the car park that will be on show pictured covered in plants and greenery to help it blend in with the natural surroundings. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests. During his initial proposals, Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor-to-ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light, pictured . Much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone-coloured walls to add to the building's natural-looking design, pictured. The 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff . This image shows the Apple Campus 2 from above. The site will be surrounded by a man-made forest featuring 7,000 trees. It was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and is currently covered in around 80 per cent asphalt . Natural gas will, primarily, provide . the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in . emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels. ‘You see the energy and the love and . the attention to detail that we've put into this,’ said Apple CFO Peter . Oppenheimer at an unveiling of the top secret spaceship plans. ‘We have treated this project just as . we would any Apple product. And this will be a place for the most . creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades . to come.’ The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut’. Earlier this year Apple was asked to submit updated plans from the original 2011 design. This led to the campus being renamed as Apple Campus 2. The new plans feature underground parking hidden from view. The new images, pictured, show access roads that lead into tunnels that will take cars into this underground car park . Not all of the parking spaces will be hidden. The parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show, according to this latest image from Apple, will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in . The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach, and on-site recycling. ‘This will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world,'’ said Apple’s Whisenhunt. In the centre will be an enclosed arboretum and orchard complete with thousands of fruit, oak, and olive trees according to the San Jose Mercury-News. ‘We love California, and by adding over 2,500 new and indigenous trees that truly belong here,’ Oppenheimer said, ‘we're bringing back the beautiful orchards that once made up this valley.’ Campus 2 was designed by Norman Foster's firm Foster and Partners. The architectural experts also designed Wembley Stadium, London City Hall and The Gherkin. Apple has also factored in a 90,000-square-foot cafeteria, part of which is pictured. It will cover at least two storeys of the predominantly glass building and will feature oak tables and chairs . The cafeteria will also feature an outside dining and picnic area, pictured. Apple's Campus 2 additionally comes with a fitness centre in the northern part of the building . 'The . concept of the building,' Oppenheimer said, 'is collaboration and . fluidity.

A sea fern has grown in a landlocked area for the first time after its unique marine habitat was created by the amount of salt spread on the roads. Wildlife experts say the plant - which usually grows by the ocean - has been tricked into thinking the windswept grass verge is a coastal beach front. The withered plant, 40 miles from the nearest coastline, is thought to be surviving because of the high amounts of salt sprayed on the road over the last two cold winters. The sea fern was discovered growing alongside the A4 at Thorney Down, north east of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, by local volunteer recorder Anne Appleyard (pictured at site) It was discovered growing alongside the A4 at Thorney Down, north east of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, by local volunteer recorder Anne Appleyard. The verge was given 'Protected Road Verge' status 16 years ago because of its unique flora. Wildlife experts say the plant - which usual grows by the ocean - has been tricked into thinking the windswept grass verge is a coastal beach front . Anne said: 'I was looking mainly at the flora of the banks, including young junipers, but just happened to notice the sea fern-grass right on the edge of the road, where the verge would be affected by salt spray. 'It is one of those normally coastal plants that are spreading inland along the edge of roads treated with de-icing salt.'

Sea fern-grass is rarely found inland but is common on the coasts of England, Wales, Ireland and southern Scotland. 'I expect that it will be found by other main roads where there are other salt-tolerant plants, but walking along such roads is not very pleasant, which might be why mine is the first record,' added Anne. She excitedly sent a sample off for analysis, where stunned experts confirmed the find. Vicki James, data officer for Wiltshire and Swindon Biological Records Centre, said more volunteers were needed to study the spread of the plant. 'Each verge has a volunteer who checks on the condition of the verge and records the wildlife found there,' she said. 'We are always looking for more people to volunteer to record sightings so we hope that Anne's discovery will galvanise more people to come forward and help us record species.

Police say a drug rivalry and a fight last month led to a shooting outside a Pittsburgh high school this afternoon that left three students wounded. The teens, two age 17 and one 16, were ambushed by rivals as they walked to their cars after getting out of Brashear High School in Pittsburgh's inner-city Beechview neighborhood. Police have identified the gunman as Anjohnito 'A.J.' Willet, a 16-year-old former classmate of the wounded students. He has been charged with attempted murder. Dozens of heavily-armed SWAT officers flooded the area and the high school went into lock down as police searched for the shooters. Six people have been taken into custody, although no one has yet been charged. Those taken to police headquarters include a small child, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports. Bedlam: A man and his son are led away by police after heavily-armed SWAT officers surrounded two homes about a mile from the school . Wounded: A 17-year-old boy was grazed by a bullet in the head, another student, age 16, received a graze wound to the leg and foot, and a third, also a 16-year-old, was struck in the neck . Bad blood: The shootings were thought to be drug-related and stemmed from an October 18 fight at Brashear High School . Parents panicked as news spread about the shooting, which happened just before 3pm as students were leaving school. The teens were ambushed less than a block from the school. A security guard found one of the students, who had been shot in the head, and brought him back to campus. A teacher dragged him inside the school and put pressure on the gunshot wound as other adults locked the doors and told other students who remained inside to hide in classrooms. One of the students was shot in the neck and shoulder. One was grazed in the head. A third student was shot in the foot. None of the injuries appear to be life-threatening. All three students are recovering at a local hospital. Police say the ambush appears to be retaliation for an October 18 fight at the school between Willet and at least one of the victims - an incident that resulted in the school being on lock-down for a week. Manhunt: The victims were rushed to area hospitals are police launched a search for the gunman in the woods . Police quickly swarmed the area outside the school where the students were shot . Officers gathered in the neighborhood outside the high school where the students were shot. The search for the gunmen resulted in six arrests . The increased security only ended when one of the participants dropped out of the school. After the shooting, heavily-armed SWAT officers flooded the area. Within two hours, police had surrounded two homes about a mile from the scene of the shooting. At around 4.30pm, police announced that a . SWAT . team took five men, a woman and a young child into custody following . standoff on Rockland Avenue. The six adults are considered persons of . interest, but so far no charges have been filed. ‘All I heard were gunshots.  I just thought it was kids playing . around.  My friend said, “A kid is laying on the ground, and there is . blood.” Everyone started running,’ senior Krystal Henson told Channel . 11. Brashear senior Cody Muller, 18, told the Los Angeles Times on the phone that that he heard three or four gunshots as he was walking out of school. He said he saw a gym teacher wrapping her hooded sweatshirt around a wounded junior who was bleeding from the head. ‘As . she was pressing it on his head, all I saw was blood running down the . side of his head, it was all over the hoodie, it was on the ground,’ Muller said. “They were asking him questions, he wasn’t aware that he . was shot.’ Police told KDKA that three armed men walked out of . the nearby woods at 2.50pm as students were streaming out of Brashear . at the end of the school day. The shooters were described as three men wearing all black, The trio then reportedly ran back into the woods behind the school. Pittsburgh police said the shooting may be in retaliation for a fight that broke out at the school October 18 - possibly drug-related - which resulted in a week-long lockdown. Brashear High School, located at 590 Crane Avenue in the Beechview section of Pittsburgh, is a magnet school for computer science. 'It's just really sad that children can't go to school and be safe. I hope they catch whoever did this,' Pittsburgh Public Schools board president Sharene Shealey told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 'I hope those kids are OK, and I'm praying for their families.' Nearly 1,500 students are currently enrolled in the school, making it the biggest public high school in the city. Part of Brashear also houses South Hills Middle School, which has 580 students. The entire school complex has been placed on lockdown. In 2010, U.S. News and World Report awarded Brashear a Bronze Medal in its America's Best High Schools list.","Three students were wounded as they were leaving Brashear High School in Pittsburgh at the end of the day .

Ploughing ahead: Tory MP Richard Drax has ignored hundreds of residents' wishes by ploughing ahead with the development near Wimborne, Dorset . A millionaire Tory MP who has opposed taxpayer subsidies for green energy today sparked fury after winning permission for a giant solar farm on his sprawling estate. Richard Drax has ignored hundreds of residents' wishes by ploughing ahead with the controversial development near Wimborne, Dorset, which will be the size of 110 football pitches. It is claimed that Good Energy, the operators of the solar farm - the third biggest in Britain - will receive a substantial amount of the very government subsidies which MP for South Dorset Mr Drax has campaigned against. The 55-year-old politician has been accused of presiding over the ‘industrialisation of the countryside’, with more than 500 people objecting to the project on the grounds the 174-acre farm will be a blot on the landscape. They argued it will blight views from miles around - and that the sheer scale of the development is out of kilter with the rural location, which once inspired author Thomas Hardy in his writings. Despite protests, the local authority yesterday voted to grant planning permission by one vote. Mr Drax, who is currently supporting opposition to plans for a wind farm off the Dorset coast, has not yet personally commented today on the solar farm on his 7,000 acre Charborough Estate. But a spokesman for the Estate said: 'The Charborough Estate notes the approval of the photovoltaic scheme at Mapperton. 'The Estate has worked carefully with Good Energy (which is leasing the land from Mr Drax) to identify a suitable site and consider the balance of a wide range of interests. Aerial view: The solar farm on his 7,000 acre Charborough Estate (pictured) has been granted permission by East Dorset District Council for the next 30 years . 'The Estate will continue to liaise . closely with Good Energy and the local community to progress the project . as smoothly as reasonably possible.' Last . year Mr Drax was one of 101 Conservative MPs who wrote to the . government asking for the £7.6billion a year in subsidies to renewable . energy like wind farms to be cut. An . in an article he wrote in a local newspaper in June, Mr Drax welcomed . fracking to boost the crisis of energy supplies - and criticised . amendments to the Energy Bill. He said: ‘Rather than deal with this . potential crisis, the Energy Bill increases the subsidies for wind-farms . and solar panels to £7.6billion a year. ‘A recent House of Commons library report suggested that such subsidies have put 50,000 Britons into “fuel poverty”.’ Rupert Hardy, 62, lives a mile from the site of the solar farm which will be in Mapperton village. He said: ‘It is most curious that (Mr Drax) has been very vocal in his protests for the offshore wind farm, yet he is happy to install a giant solar farm on his estate. ‘It is also rather curious that only months ago he was talking about reducing subsidies for renewable energy when this farm on his land will be heavily subsidised. Unhappy: Mr Drax has been accused of presiding over the 'industrialisation of the countryside' with more than 500 people objecting to the project on the grounds the 174-acre farm will be a blot on the landscape . ‘He has gone against the views and wishes . of the local community. An area of great landscape value will be ruined . for the next 30 years. ‘We opposed to its sheer size and . scale - it will be the equivalent of 110 football pitches. It will have a . detrimental visual impact and will be seen for miles around. It will . impact seriously on the amenity value for horse riders and ramblers.’ 'It is most curious that (Mr Drax) has been very vocal in his protests for the offshore wind farm, yet he is happy to install a giant solar farm on his estate' Rupert Hardy, local resident . Katharine Butler, of Dorchester, the daughter of retired Foreign Office diplomat Sir Michael Butler, grew up in Mapperton. She said: ‘This beautiful landscape is now threatened to become a hideous industrial park of glass and steel. It is effectively the industrialisation of the countryside. These farms have to be in the right places. ‘If Richard Drax is so keen on renewable energy why not put the farm in view of his beautiful home, within the high walls of Charborough Park and not have to disturb others? ‘It’s hard not to feel that the impetus behind this scheme is financial and not about renewable energy. It will receive a huge sum in subsidies on top of the electricity that is generated that will be sold to the national grid.’ Empty space: Part of the proposed site for the new solar farm near the village of Mapperton in Dorset . The solar farm has been granted permission by East Dorset District Council for the next 30 years. It will contain 120,000 solar panels on grade 3a arable land and will generate power to nearly 7,000 homes. 'This beautiful landscape is now threatened to become a hideous industrial park of glass and steel' Katharine Butler, opposing the farm . The project will be run by the company Good Energy which will lease the land from Mr Drax. The Drax family are no strangers at being labelled the villain of the piece. Mr Drax’s late grandfather Sir Reginald . Drax went to school with James Bond creator Ian Fleming who named Hugo . Drax, the villain in Moonraker, after him. Richard Drax, whose full name is . Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, previously said in a . statement that the solar farm had taken local residents’ views. He . said: ‘Following a detailed and thorough assessment of the area, an . application for planning consent for the proposal has been submitted. Village: Mapperton, the site of the huge solar farm, which residents argue will blight views from miles around . ‘The opinion of the local community was sought prior to submitting the application and will continue to be incorporated. The site is well screened and the land will be planted to a wildflower rich grass sward. 'The opinion of the local community was sought prior to submitting the application and will continue to be incorporated' Richard Drax, in a previous statement . ‘The local area will benefit from a community fund to be established. At the end of the project the land will return to the existing agricultural use.’ Good Energy said the solar farm will have a capacity to generate 28MW of power and will generate enough renewable electricity to power around 6,800 homes. Ben Gowers, head of development at Good Energy said: ‘We would like to thank everyone who has supported the project so far. ‘The location and design of the solar farm will make the most of the area’s sunshine for renewable energy generation while minimising impacts on the landscape, and enhancing biodiversity.’ The scheme is expected to begin generating electricity as early as April next year.

Questions have been raised over whether former NFL star Brian Holloway exaggerated damage caused by teenagers who held a party in his New York vacation home to help pay for repairs. Eight people were charged and more than $20,000 of damage was alleged to have been caused at the rural retreat during an illegal Labor Day party. But the former Patriots' Save the 300 campaign set up in the aftermath of the party is alleged to have been a way to raise money to repair the property before it was sold at a foreclosure auction. Auction: Brian Holloway's New York vacation home was auctioned for $400,000 after damage caused by partying teenagers was repaired . In an article on Grantland, it is alleged that Holloway failed to clearly distinguish between damage caused by young party-goers, and wear and tear on the Stephentown property he had bought in 1981. The 54-year-old was also accused of being uncaring about the online abuse teenagers at the party on his 200-acre property received after he shared details of their social media profiles online. 'It's not my responsibility. It's their parents' responsibility to get that handled. I would not want anyone to get hurt. And unfortunately, they put themselves in harm's way,' he told Grantland. Holloway, who played offensive tackle for . the Patriots and Raiders in the 1980s, gained national attention by . reposting party pictures the teenagers had put on social media websites. He told Mail Online the allegations were 'nonsense, but expected,' and added that the campaign 'is growing in response to the global outrage from all over the world'. He . said he posted pictures of the teenagers involved on helpmesave300.com in an effort to . get them to come forward, take responsibility for their actions and . change their behavior. The motivational speaker also collected . donations for theHMS300 campaign, named after the number of . teenagers who allegedly partied at the property, and a breast cancer . charity. Damage: Holloway power washes graffiti in a barn. Some of it was allegedly painted on by friends of the footballer's children when they lived there . Dirty: Holloway arrived home to find his floor covered in booze and urine . Campaign: After his home was damaged Holloway encouraged the teenagers and other young people to help repair the damage . 'Although there were many people who wanted the money to be directed to help repair some of the damage, because no kids or parents stepped up, we wanted to direct all the donations that came in to HMS300,' Holloway said, adding that he paid for all the repairs. The father-of-eight wants to work with . students around the U.S. to prevent flash parties from happening and to . develop software that can help parents monitor their teenagers' social . media activity. 'I have to take a stand against the urgent undertone of destruction that's happening in our communities,' Holloway said. When the house was sold for $400,000 at a foreclosure auction at the end of October, and reports in local media claimed Holloway owed more than $1 million to the bank, concerns were raised that funds may have been used elsewhere. The party-damaged home became a national story, but photos of graffiti, a smashed window, some of the damage to floorboards and a hole in the barn were later claimed to have been long-standing damage. While some graffiti was done at the party 'The walls of the barn had been something of a running guestbook for the Holloway family - kids who visited the home would spray paint their names on the wall,' Grantland reported. Holloway hit back at the allegations that he had used the party as a way to get help with repairs, saying he was 'totally blindsided by Berkshire Bank' when it refused to move back the auction date as he tried to come to terms with the break in and damage at the property. Smashed: Windows were broken at the house which the footballer bought in 1981 . Damage: Railings on the wrap-around porch had fallen into disrepair but Grantland alleged that reports of damage caused by the teenagers was exaggerated . The website article alleged that Holloway refused to answer when questioned about why donors to the breast cancer charity were asked to make checks out to Save the 300. 'The donation add on was in response to so many people from across the country who wanted to dosomething to help out and be a part. And we've raised about $12,000,' Holloway, who lives in Florida, told Mail Online. 'We also added a link for Breast Cancer, for those people that would want to make a donation directlyto Breast Cancer,' he added. The . footballer, who lost his mother to breast cancer, said the link used . for donations was the same used by the national cancer organization. For now, Holloway's focus is back on raising his family, but he said he hoped to find a way to buy back his New York home, which is filled with family memories. He is also upbeat about the future of the 300 Campaign, and has been meeting youth groups and universities to gather momentum behind the project. 'Over the next 90 days we will see the HMS300 campaign take on it's life and direction through the many people who want to use this as a spring board to save lives,' he told Mail Online. 'I'm basically the one driving it right now [but] I've got some great people in mind to help me put together a larger strategy.' Holloway shrugged off the scrutiny of his campaign, saying: 'I'm not someone special. I'm just anotherperson who is joining with others to make a difference.' Motivational speaker: The former NFL linebacker and father-of-eight started a campaign to empower teenagers to make the right decisions and to help parents keep a closer eye on what their children are doing .","Footballer set up Save the 300 campaign after teenagers caused $20,000 damage .

Chancellor George Osborne is mulling the plan to persuade firms to take on more young people . Firms could be offered a tax cut if they hire unemployed young people. Chancellor George Osborne is considering a plan which would mean national insurance was not pay for jobless under-25s given work. While the total number of people out of work has fallen in the last year, the number of unemployed young people has remained stubbornly high at almost 1million. Mr Osborne is expected to use next month’s Autumn Statement to unveil measures to get more people in their teens and twenties into work. Latest figures show there were 965,000 unemployed people aged 16-15, of which two third were not in full-time education. It has not changed at all in the last year, and is still 40 per cent higher than the level seen before the 2008 crash. Under the plan put to Mr Osborne, businesses would not pay employer’s national insurance contributions if they hire an unemployed person who is under 25. It is argued that the move would actually save the Treasury money, because the £520 annual cost per young worker is less than paying them to be on benefits. In theory hiring every unemployed young person would cost £287million a year, compared to the £10billion bill for youth unemployment. The number of 18 to 24-year-olds who have been out of work for more than a year has risen to 281,000. The numbers claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for more than two years has almost doubled this year. The idea is being pushed by the Million Jobs campaign, which argues that money used for Jobseekers Allowance would be better used to persuade firms to take on young people. Flatlining: Four years after the financial crash, the number of young people out of work has remained stubbornly high at around 1million . Director Lottie Dexter said: ‘Despite all this talk of economic recovery, for many young people across the country nothing has changed. ‘Youth unemployment continues to be sky high and hovers around one million – it has done for well over four years now. ‘Hundreds of thousands of young people need wrap-around support, they should be matched and mentored into work so they can find and keep jobs. It is essential that we throw these vulnerable young people a lifeline. ‘This should be combined with a National Insurance break for employers who take on one of the under-25s and schools should be encouraged to make the most of their alumni; having past pupils helping new school leavers navigate a dicey jobs market.’ Recovery: For all adults aged 16 and over the unemployment rate has fallen sharply to a four-year low of 7.6 per cent . Mr Osborne and his team have been briefed on the plan by Tory MP Brooks Newmark, who urged the Chancellor to announce the policy on December 5. ‘While our growth prospects are looking better and better, it is important we pay special attention to our young people,’ Mr Newmark told The Sun. A senior Treasury source added: 'George will do something to keep on tackling youth unemployment in the Autumn Statement. He recognises this is an important priority.' Simon Walker, director deneral of the Institute of Directors, said: 'It is absolutely right that the Chancellor should be considering ways of tackling the UK’s unacceptably high level of youth unemployment. 'National Insurance increases the cost of employing people. Businesses would be more likely to take on extra staff if they had to pay less tax to do so. This also applies to jobseekers over 25.'","Chancellor to use Autumn Statement to tackle unemployment crisis .

'A steady move away': The Most Reverend Justin Welby said that Church of England schools were moving away from using faith tests . Anglican schools are moving away from selecting pupils on the basis of religion, the Archbishop of Canterbury said yesterday. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said faith-based entry tests were no longer the best way of choosing students. ‘There are unbelievably brilliant schools that are entirely open to all applicants without selection criteria apart from residence, where you live, and which produce staggeringly good results,’ he said. ‘It is not necessary to select to get a really good school. It’s a question of - and you can point to them all over the place - it’s a  question of outstanding leadership.’ The archbishop, who was educated at Eton but sent his five children to state schools, said having a more open policy on candidates without faith could be beneficial for the schools. ‘What you are seeing in the church schools is a deeper and deeper commitment to the common good,’ he added. ‘There’s a steady move away from faith-based entry tests.’ But after making the controversial remarks in an interview with The Times the archbishop appeared to row back. In a statement, released by Lambeth Palace, he threw his weight behind selection by faith. ‘I fully support the current policy for schools to set their own admissions criteria, including the criterion of faith,’ he insisted. ‘Nothing in my wider comments on this subject should be seen as dissenting from this policy.’ About one million children attend the Church of England’s 4,484 primary and middle schools and 193 secondaries. The schools are often oversubscribed and give preference to parents who regularly attend church. Churches in the parishes of the most popular schools keep records of families who attend their services to curb parents who attempt to cut corners to get their children in. Three-quarters of Church schools are judged good or outstanding by Ofsted whereas just 57 per cent of all state schools receive the same classification. Rowing back? After his interview with The Times, the archbishop clarified that he supported schools setting their own admissions criteria . A move away from faith-based selection would not be welcomed by traditionalists within the Church or the parents who attend church regularly and expect their child to be given a place before someone with no faith. Critics of selection on the grounds of faith say it can discriminate against less well off pupils. Andrew Copson of the British Humanist Association said: ‘One of the worst aspects of state faith schools is religious selection in admissions.' It segregates pupils on the basis of their parents’ beliefs and on socio-economic and ethnic grounds. Any move to end it must be welcome.’ The Bishop of Oxford has previously called for CofE schools to cut down to one in ten the number of places reserved for practising Anglicans, even if it meant a fall in standards. The Right Reverend John Pritchard, head of the Church’s education board, said two years ago that schools must serve ‘the wider community’. Archbishop Welby spoke before addressing a conference on alleviating poverty.","The Most Reverend Justin Welby said selection is 'not necessary'

Bank of England governor Mark Carney once described the UK as a 'crisis economy' but he is now optimistic about fiscal growth . There is a 50/50 chance that unemployment will fall to the level next year which would trigger a rise in interest rates, the Bank of England has warned. Governor Mark Carney said the economic recovery has finally taken hold, raising the prospect of a rise in the cost of borrowing. With the number in work reaching a record high, Mr  Carney said the ‘glass is half full’ as output grows at its fastest pace in six years. The Canadian, who took up the job in  July and has previously branded the UK a ‘crisis economy’, added: ‘We have one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world.’ He predicted unemployment is likely to fall by late 2014 to the 7 per cent he has set as a threshold for the Bank to consider raising interest rates. Analysts quickly suggested rates may go up at the end of next year or in 2015 rather than in late 2016 as the Bank indicated only three months ago. The prospect led to the London stock market suffering its worst one-day fall for three months with £25billion wiped off the value of blue-chip companies. Mr Carney said rates will not need to rise if the cost of living remains under control. Inflation fell to 2.2 per cent in October – close to the Bank’s 2 per cent target. However he also said he was ‘absolutely’ prepared to raise interest rates in the run-up to the general election in 2015 if required. The Bank said there was a 50-50 chance unemployment will reach 7 per cent in the final three months of 2014. It . sparked speculation that rates could rise in as little as 12 months in . what would be a blow to millions of borrowers but ease the pain suffered . by Britain’s army of savers and pensioners. Mark Harris, chief executive . of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘There is now growing . panic that interest rates might actually rise next year, rather than . 2016 as previously indicated.’ With . investors betting on an early hike, the pound rose sharply but the . stock market fell with the FTSE 100 index down 96.79 points to 6630. Mr . Carney insisted the 7 per cent threshold set by the Bank is a  ‘staging . post’ for reassessing interest rates ‘not a trigger for an automatic . increase’. The Canadian . stressed that although the economy is growing again it has not yet . returned to ‘normality’ – hinting that rates could stay at rock bottom . well beyond the end of next year. He . said the Bank will hold rates down for as long as required ‘so that . British households and businesses have the confidence not just that the . glass is half full but that it will be filled’. Mr Carney said: ‘With the recovery taking hold, our task now is to secure it. ‘A strong and sustained recovery is needed to put people back in work.’ Green shoots: The Bank said it expects the economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in the final three months of this year . Publishing its most optimistic set of . forecasts for years in the latest quarterly inflation report, the Bank . raised its outlook for growth and jobs and lowered its outlook for . inflation. It came as . figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that employment . rose by 177,000 between July and September to a record high of . 29.95million; . Hailing . the good news, Mr Carney said: ‘Inflation is now as low as it has been . since 2009. Jobs are being created at a rate of 60,000 per month. The improved outlook is a boost to Chancellor George Osborne ahead of next month's autumn statement . 'The . economy is growing at its fastest pace for six years. For the first . time in a long time you don’t have to be an optimist to see the glass is . half full. The recovery has finally taken hold.’ The . Bank said it expects the economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in the final . three months of this year – building on the 0.8 per cent expansion seen . in the third quarter and 0.7 per cent in the second. It raised its growth forecast for 2013 from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent and for 2014 from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent. Mr . Carney also said inflation – which has been above 2 per cent since the . end of 2009 – will fall back to target at the start of 2015. The improved outlook is a boost to George Osborne ahead of next month’s autumn statement. The . Chancellor said: ‘Unemployment is falling, the economy is growing and . inflation is down, that shows our economic plan is working and – as the . governor of the Bank of England says – the recovery is taking hold.’ David Cameron said the good economic news was evidence ‘tough decisions’ had paid off. But . Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘After three damaging years of . flatlining these growth forecasts are welcome, but for millions of . families this is still no recovery at all.’ The economy is still 2.5 per cent smaller than it was before the recession struck and the ONS employment report showed a record 1.46million people are working part time. The average worker has also seen wages rise by just 0.8 per cent in the past year, well below the rate of inflation, as the squeeze on household finances continues.","Bank of England Governor is optimistic saying the 'glass is half-full'

They’re fierce predators that rip flesh from bones using razor sharp teeth and strangle their prey, yet new video footage shows lions being as playful as household cats. Captured by lion whisperer and zoologist Kevin Richardson, 39, in Pretoria, South Africa, the footage was filmed using GoPro camera fitted to his back.

While hand-held footage additionally captures amazing close-up shots of hyenas walking across the plains. In an exclusive interview, Richardson told MailOnline he’s been working with the big cats for 16 years. ‘I’ve always been passionate about animals of all shapes and sizes. I got the opportunity to work with two male lion cubs 16 years back and was bitten by the bug. ‘I’ve been very privileged to have been accepted into the lives of many different lions over the years and and also to raise awareness to the plight of lions in the wild and their dwindling numbers.’ Watch the full 14-minute video here. The lions caught on camera are 10 years old, according to Richardson.

The lions are then filmed chasing after and running alongside Richardson’s car and he describes the cats as 'boisterous' but admits 'he’s never been bitten'. This close relationship meant Richardson was also able to attach the cameras to the back of the lions. Richardson told MailOnline: ‘We filmed with a GoPro team over several days and I’ve used the [camera] with the lions so they are accustomed to posing. ‘I only put cameras on the backs of lions who I knew potentially wouldn't mind them.

The bikers who savagely beat Alexian Lien on a New York City street in September, turned their attention to the tech executive's wife and young daughter when they were done with him, prosecutors have revealed. The New York Daily News reports that the brutal bikers tried to snatch Mrs Lien and her young daughter from their black Range Rover as Mr Lien lay battered on the sidewalk. 'You're going to get it, too,' one of the bikers told the terrified woman, according to Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass. Scroll down for video . Hurt: . Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New . York as he tried to protect his wife and child. It has now emerged that . an undercover cop was part of the group that attacked . The biker gang was furious that Mr Lien had run over one of their compatriots and sped after him seeking revenge on September 29. Video from one of the bikers shows that the gang had boxed in Mr Lien - who was out for a drive with his wife and their daughter to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Eleven members of the motorcycle club have been charged in connection with the brutal assault - including Wojciech Braszczok, an undercover NYPD detective who is accused of taking part in the melee. Angry bikers caught up the Alexian on a busy street and bashed out his window with their helmets. When they were done beating him, some of the thugs tried to attack Rosalyn Lien and her two-year-old daughter, who were cowering in the car, Steinglass told the Daily News. Alongside: A biker matching Braszczok's description can be seen riding next to the rear of the SUV in YouTube videos of the attack . Involvement: Braszczok appears to get off his bike in a YouTube video of the brutal assault . Symbols: Braszczok's jacket bears the insignia of the Front Line Soldiers, a motorcycle club based in New Rochelle, New York, just north of New York City . The veteran officer will be presented with the indictment at a November 20 arraignment in Manhattan Supreme Court. Braszczok is also charged with gang assault in . the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in . the third degree. New York Daily News reported all the bikers except Christopher Cruz face gang assault charges and the possibility of decades in jail. Cruz, who was rear-ended by Lien, was initially charged in misdemeanor court but now faces felony level criminal mischief and up to four years in prison. Footage from the September 29 incident shows Braszczok, who was off duty at the time, getting closer and closer to Alexian Lien's car . Hiding: Braszczok leaves court in New York today with his face hidden after a short hearing into his role in the biker gang assault . Occupy jail: Wojciech Braszczok, 32, was held in custody for his alleged role in the biker gang beating. He has served with NYPD for ten years and was allegedly undercover with Occupy Wall St for five of those . Allen Edwards, who told cops he was trying to stop the . attack, was also included in the indictment. He 'was the voice of reason and was the most reasonable, courageous . person there, to stand up to these people who he's not friends with. He . doesn't know these bikers', his lawyer said. Lien was chased up the West Side Highway and was pulled out of his car . on W. 178th St. as his wife watched in horror with their young child in . the back seat. A YouTube video of the . attack shows a rider fitting Braszczok's description in the main group . chasing Alexian Lien's Range Rover. At no point does he try to stop the pursuit. At around two minutes he surges from the back and positions himself to the left of the vehicle. His red bike - which looks like the one in Braszczok's online postings - is later seen right behind the SUV boxing it in. When . Lien stops for the first time the man has moved to its driver's side . and as one biker tries to open the driver's door, he goes to get off his . bike to assist, but Lien speeds off. Then he is seen again at the end when Lien is set upon during the second, final confrontation. Biker punk: Braszczok created a very alternative online persona and he cut his hair in a mohawk to look just like those he was mixing with . The video shows the man believed to be Braszczok apparently pulling up alongside the right of the Range Rover. His . lawyers in court on October 9 claimed that he never went within 12ft of the vehicle . but he is much closer than that as his bike comes to a halt by the rear . window. Braszczok's defence . also claimed in court that the window was already broken - but in the . video it is still intact when he reaches it. The . court was told that he took part in a 'brutal and brazen' attack and . that while other members of the bike gang hauled Lien out of his car and . set upon him, Braszczok continued to 'terrorize' his family. The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He . then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting . in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the . back.

But he admitted that, because they took up more space, more land would be needed for developments to meet demand. Retirement: The majority of pensioners would like to 'end their days' in a bungalow, the government's planning minister has claimed . It is thought more single-storey houses would persuade older people to downsize, freeing up more family homes and kick-starting the housing market. Bungalow account for just one in 50 of all properties across the country, and four years ago just 300 bungalows were built in the UK. Mr Boles suggested that developments that included bungalows instead of standard houses or apartments could escape opposition from people living nearby. ‘Bungalows, we have built far too few. People love them. Every opinion poll, you ask people where they would like to end their days they all say they all say, not all but a lot of them, that they want to end their days in a bungalow,’ he told the Politicians in Planning Association conference last week. ‘If we’re going to provide for more bungalows we’re going to have to provide more land than we otherwise would. ‘Now some of you will be happy to do that and others will say actually that’s just impossible in our circumstance, and therefore we’re going to create apartment buildings.’ Planning Minister Nick Boles said most people 'love' bungalows and would not object to them being built near them . Retro: Ministers want a return to the sort of bungalows showcased at the Ideal Home Exhibition 1963 like this Berg 'Milton' Bungalow . Ministers have previously been urged to encourage more bungalows to stimulate the housing market . Older people who are reluctant to move out of family homes, even when children have moved away, could be persuaded to downsize to bungalows as a preferred way of living. Mr Boles added: ‘Bungalows are not a universal panacea, but they are very popular and therefore if you have land in your neighbourhoods and you propose to allocate it specifically to bungalows I think you’ll find that those site allocations are some of the more popular ones that you make.’ In April the Policy Exchange think tank called for planning rules to be torn up to encourage developers to move away from tiny box flats to investing in low level living. It called for councils to lose control over granting planning permission, instead allowing local people to decide what can and cannot be built in their town or village. Residents could be more willing to support a wave of new bungalows, because they are less likely to impact on views. Bungalows were popular in the 1970s, but fell out of fashion as developers rushed to build blocks of flats . The Policy Exchange report added: ‘If thirty per cent of people’s ideal home is a bungalow, and this preference is even stronger for older people, it make no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock. ‘Older people currently living in large family homes might want to downsize to a bungalow, which is smaller and easier to maintain, as well as being on one floor and offering outside space. ‘There are huge numbers of spare rooms in homes older people are currently living in. What are needed are the homes that older people like and so would like to move into. ‘But planning policy prevents these homes from being built – and this is before we even begin to discuss the fact that higher land prices caused by our planning system would in any case mitigate against building bungalows.’","Nick Boles says people 'love' bungalows and called for more to be built .
Admitted they take up more space, so more land will be needed .

The International Space Station (ISS), the second brightest object in our night sky, celebrates its 15th birthday today. Its journey began back in November 20th 1998, when the Russian Space Agency launched a spacecraft called Zarya into orbit. The launch was the dawn of the largest international cooperation effort in space to ever come to fruition. Scroll down for video interactive timeline... The International Space Station, the second brightest object in our night sky, celebrates its 15th birthday today . Zarya became the first piece of the International Space Station, which is currently in orbit 220 miles above Earth. Two weeks later, on December 4 1998, the space shuttle Endeavour launched Unity, the first U.S. piece of the complex. The two space modules built on opposite sides of the planet were about to be joined together in space, making the space station an international collaboration. Blanketing clouds form the backdrop for this 70mm scene of the connected Zarya and Unity modules after having been released from Endeavour's cargo bay a bit earlier . ‘We definitely knew there was no margin for error on that first mission—we had to be successful,’ said Bob Cabana, the Kennedy Space Center director. ‘We also knew that it wasn’t all on the crew. This was a team effort, and everyone was giving it all they had to ensure success.’ Since that first momentous meeting of Zarya and Unity, the space station has grown piece by piece. Today the ISS has a mass of almost a million pounds and is the size of a football field. To date, station and shuttle crews have conducted 174 spacewalks totalling almost 1,100 hours .

It represents a collaboration between Nasa, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

So far at least 1,500 scientific studies have been carried out in space, and the results are being used back here on Earth by the 69 countries that have taken part.

Alan Barlow arriving at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court where he was given a conditional discharge after being pictured carrying an unexploded bomb . Two men caught on camera casually carrying two unexploded bombs away from a beach in Dorset have been prosecuted by the Ministry of Defence. Alan Barlow, 71 and Jason Kelly, 33, were pictured with the two potentially deadly rusty 120mm tank shells slung over their shoulders. Onlookers watched as the men strolled past them with the explosives, which date back to the Cold War, before loading the 2ft bombs into their cars and driving away. The men discovered the ordnance washed up at Warbarrow Bay, a coastal beauty spot on the south coast. The area is part of a 7,000-acre Lulworth Military Range in Dorset, which is used by the Army for tank firing practise. The MoD launched an investigation into the incident, urging the two men to come forward so the bombs could be safely disposed of. Barlow contacted military police and both men were charged with possession of a projectile and removing it from the danger area without lawful authority under local bylaws. Bournemouth Magistrates' Court heard that Barlow and his daughter’s fiance Kelly, removed the shells fearing that children might play with them. Jonathan Morrissey, defending, said the two men saw a group of children playing by the clifftop. He said: 'They noticed a pile of disused shells, maybe half a dozen or more. 'They were clearly not live because of the presence of concrete. 'They . made the decision to put the shells in the car, he was public spirited . in an inappropriate way. There is no nefarious or sinister intent here. 'There are notices with regard to local bylaws but Mr Barlow and his colleagues were not in a position to see them.' Barlow and his son-in-law Jason Kelly said they picked up the unexploded bombs, which are thought to date from the Cold War, fearing children nearby might play with them . Barlow appeared in court and pleaded guilty to the charge. Kelly, who did not attend the hearing, posted his guilty verdict. Both men were given an absolute discharge and were ordered to pay £85 each in costs. A woman who took the picture of the pair on her mobile phone at the time, said: 'I thought they were carrying rugs at first but as they walked past I saw they were enormous shells. 'I was with somebody who used to be in the Army and he said that because their ends were intact, they were unexploded. 'I was really scared. As they were walking past, my little girl was alongside them. I just think they're a pair of idiots.' Another person said: 'What a couple of twits. If you see anything like this you should always call the police, not cart it on home.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank . Speaking at the time a spokesman for the MoD said the shells would have probably been fired from a Chieftain tank or a Wombat anti-tank rifle used by the Army in the 70s and 80s. He said: 'These shells have swiftly been recovered and we would like to urge the public using the ranges to keep to the designated pathways and remember that it is potentially extremely dangerous to touch any military material they may find. ‘We take the safety of the public extremely seriously and all pathways at Lulworth Ranges that are open to the public are cleared of military debris, including shells, before access is permitted. ‘A number of signs have been placed on-site warning members of the public of the dangers of venturing from authorised pathways and removing shells. Unfortunately there are instances where these warnings are ignored.’","Alan Barlow and Jason Kelly were caught on camera carrying the unexploded bombs away from a Dorset beach, slung over their shoulders .

Rude awakening: A man answers the door in his dressing gown as police in Tyne and Wear deliver early morning warnings to nightmare neighbours . They are the neighbours from hell known for their noisy parties, screaming arguments and anti-social behaviour. But this time they were the ones getting a rude awakening. Police in Tyne and Wear burst in to a series of homes in the early hours of yesterday morning to deliver final warnings or eviction notices. Officers visited 22 homes in Wallsend to tell tenants - many dressed in pyjamas and dressing gowns - that they face being booted out if they do not mend their ways. All the tenants had racked up a shameful series of complaints from those living around them fed up by their noise, anti-social behaviour, music, loud arguments. After issuing a number of warnings, staff from North Tyneside Council's Safer Estates Team served 20 tenants with legal notices giving them one last chance to change before losing their homes. And two were handed eviction notices telling them court proceedings would soon be started to kick them out. The action was taken as part of a joint police and council initiative called Operation Respect. North Tyneside council's safer estates manager, Colin Boxshall, said: 'Operation Respect involves serving nuisance households with final warning notices. If the anti-social behaviour continues people risk being evicted.' Crimes linked to the properties included drunk and disorderly, theft, criminal damage, breach of the peace, drug offences, threatening behaviour, intimidation, noise nuisance and shoplifting.

She told authorities that she was ordered to deliver 3lb of the highly addictive drug by her boyfriend in exchange for £3,100. She was arrested in April after a tip off to police. Until February last year, she worked as a PCSO for Gloucestershire Police. After leaving her job, Waldeck travelled to the other side of the world to become part of what prosecutors called 'evil conspiracy' involving an Indonesian drug-smuggling gang.

Just weeks ago she told friends on a Facebook message: 'Your support means the world to me. I’m so very sorry I’ve disappointed you all.' After her arrest, Waldeck co-operated with police in a double sting, first meeting a contact who was arrested as he arrived to collect the drugs from her hotel and then flying under police guard with the other suspect to the capital Jakarta. Drugs: Waldeck admitted smuggling crystal meth on a flight from China to Surabaya in April . On May 2, Waldeck and the other suspect took part in a further sting, meeting another of the drug syndicate's members in a Jakarta street where he was arrested after they passed the drugs on to him. Waldeck was then transferred to chronically-overcrowded Medaeng after spending the first four months after her arrest in police cells in Jakarta. She was the only Western prisoner in Medaeng prison, where she shared a cramped cell with 16 other women.

Records show the defendant had showered politicians, often Republicans, with political donations.

The Foreign Office has apologised and agreed to pay £1,000 compensation to a British woman who was raped by a military officer in Egypt, after they failed to provide proper support to her following the attack. A damning investigation by the Parliamentary Ombudsman found the FCO was guilty of 'maladministration and injustice' after the woman turned to it for help when she was assaulted in May 2011. In her report, Dame Julie Mellor said that although the woman - referred to only as Ms M - had clearly been frightened and vulnerable, officials at the British Embassy in Cairo failed to explain clearly how they could help her. The Foreign Office has apologised and agreed to pay £1,000 compensation to a British woman who was raped by a military officer in Egypt, after officials at the British Embassy in Cairo (pictured) failed to provide proper support to her following the attack . They did not arrange a medical examination or offer to accompany her to a hospital and had no knowledge of post-exposure prophylaxis - a treatment which can prevent HIV infection after the virus has entered the body. In particular, the report said officials did not accompany her to report the attack, and failed to appreciate her fears that she could be arrested or even killed if she made a complaint against a military officer to the police who were themselves under the control of the military. 'Ms M was far away from home, she had been through a terrifying ordeal, and the FCO were the only authority she could approach for help. She should have been able to rely on them to fulfil their role and assist her when she was at her most vulnerable,' the report said. Ms M's ordeal began when she was stopped at a checkpoint while travelling in the Sinai region, three months after the revolution which overthrew President Hosni Mubarak. A man in plain clothes, who she believed to be a military officer, told her she would not be able to continue her journey until the next day. He took her to a place where he said she could sleep and then raped her. The following day, with the help of a friend, she contacted the FCO - initially through its Global Response Centre in London - appealing for advice on what to do and help in getting a medical examination. However when she went to a hospital, on a list supplied by the Global Response Centre, she was told by the doctor that she did not need a HIV test as there was no HIV in Egypt. Later that morning when she went to report the attack to the tourist police she found herself in a room with a number of armed plain-clothes officers - a situation she described as 'extremely intimidating'. Dame Julie Mellor said that officials failed to explain clearly how they could help the woman . She was told that in order to complete her complaint she would have to go to military headquarters, something she felt she had no choice but to comply with despite being reluctant to go. Ms M said she was finally allowed out shortly before 3am so that she could try to obtain antiretroviral drugs, on the understanding she would return at 9am to complete her statement. When she failed to do so an officer was sent to interview her at her friend's apartment where he required her to re-enact what happened when she was assaulted, including demonstrating the positions she had been forced into. While Ms M was in telephone contact with the embassy while she was at the police station and the military headquarters, she said it would have made a 'huge difference' it she had be told that an official could actually have been with her. On a return to the UK she complained to the FCO about the way she had been treated with 'impatience, rudeness and a serious lack of sensitivity' by its staff. Her complaint was initially rejected, but after the first the human rights charity Redress and then ombudsman became involved, the FCO agreed to apologise and pay £1,000 in compensation. Mr Fraser said: 'We apologise unreservedly to Ms M for the mistakes we made in her case and fully accept the recommendations in the ombudsman's report. 'We have taken a number of actions to ensure that this does not happen again and we will give Ms M a comprehensive update on the steps we have taken in December. We remain committed to delivering a high-quality consular service to British nationals overseas, particularly to those who are most vulnerable.' Dame Julie said: 'This is a prime example of how one individual coming forward to complain can lead to significant changes.'","Officials failed to explain clearly how they could help woman after attack .

Of those who do intend to make preparations for the winter, almost half are waiting until the temperatures become noticeably colder. The survey by garage chain Halfords Autocentres was carried out to check how prepared motorists are for the bad weather.

A businessman sold a lump of clay instead of an iPad by Tesco was arrested on suspicion of fraud when he complained to the supermarket giant. Colin Marsh, 47, paid £470 for the Apple tablet computer in Whitstable, Kent, as a Christmas present last year for his young daughters - but he opened the box to find it contained three lumps of clay. The father, who runs two bakeries, immediately took it back to the store for a refund - but instead of reimbursing him, Tesco staff became suspicious and reported him to Kent Police. Arrested: Colin Marsh (pictured with his wife Sam and daughter Maddie) paid £470 for the Apple tablet computer in Whitstable, Kent - but he opened the box to find it contained three lumps of clay (seen in this image) Two days later Mr Marsh, father to Maddie, 11, and Daisy, eight - got a call asking him to report to his local police station where he was held for three hours, and accused of trying to scam Tesco. He spent two months on bail before being told he faced no further action. The iPad that should have been in the box was tracked down to Wales, more than 200 miles from where he had bought it. Mr Marsh, who has since got his money back, said: ‘You just can’t treat people like that. It’s absolutely disgusting. I couldn’t believe it when I saw what was inside the box. 'Maddie was devastated. I took it back to Tesco, but they said they couldn’t give me a refund and would need to carry out an investigation. Three lumps of clay: Tesco staff became suspicious and reported Mr Marsh to Kent Police . ‘Two days later, I got a call at about 8pm from the police asking if I could come down to the station to answer some questions. I just thought they wanted to know what had happened. ‘But the next thing I know I’m being bundled into a cell. I was in there for three hours. It was then they told me the iPad had been activated in my name. I just thought “how can that possibly be?” ‘It didn’t make any sense. I’ve run my own successful businesses for 22 years, and I own my own house. Why would I want to scam Tesco out of a £470 iPad? I wouldn’t want anyone else to go through what my family and I have.’ Mr Marsh, who is married to hairdresser Sam, 45, bought the iPad just before Christmas last year. He went back to complain on Boxing Day but was told staff needed to ‘investigate’. Police then called him and he voluntarily attended Whitstable police station on December 28 where officers claimed the iPad had been registered to him. Mr Marsh remained on bail until February 14 when the missing tablet was found registered in Wales.

A heartbroken husband is thought to have killed himself just hours after his wife died because he could not bear to carry on without her. Adrian Cross, 45, was found dead at the couple’s home from a suspected overdose. For nine months his wife Tammy, 37, had suffered from a debilitating lung condition, but lost her battle with the disease on October 8. Devoted: Heartbroken Adrian Cross, 45, is thought to have killed himself just hours after his wife Tammy, 37, died because he could not bear to carry on without her. The couple, pictured on their wedding day in the Dominican Republic, were married for 15 years . She weighed only six stone when she died. The couple, who married in the Dominican Republic 15 years ago before a second ceremony at home in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, were said to have been ‘in love from the day they met’. Mrs Cross’s father, David Allan Jones, 65, said: ‘In all the years they were together, they had never spent a night apart. They were completely devoted to each other. ‘Their love was so strong that if they went out, they would write love notes to each other. We have found them all around the house.’ Couple: Adrian and Tammy Cross both died on October 8 after she had suffered from a lung disease . He . added: ‘I have never seen love like it and I don’t think I ever will . again. Adrian always said that if anything ever happened to her he would . be straight behind her.’ Mrs Cross had four older siblings – brother Dean and sisters Dawn, Gail and Marie. Her mother Phyllis Jones, 61, is divorced from Mr Jones but they remain close friends. She said: ‘I know children love their mother but she was different. We called her angel. ‘You . can’t imagine losing your daughter before you. I don’t know how I am . going to cope. Adrian was a son to us. He did everything for our Tammy. He looked after her and my family.’ Mrs Cross was said to be a popular face at Georgetown Fish Bar in Merthyr Tydfil where she worked. She later became a carer for her father, before falling ill herself. Inseparable: Mr and Mrs Cross apparently fell in love when they met and never spent a night apart . Tragic: Mr Cross is believed to have taken an overdose shortly after the death of his beloved wife . On holiday: The couple used to leave love notes around the house for each other to find, according to relatives . Mrs Jones added: ‘Tammy was frightened and so ill but never broke down, she kept us upbeat. ‘She . was so strong … We were back and forth to the doctors with her. She had . a heart condition and it affected her lungs – she died in terrible . pain. ‘I was so terrified for her but we didn’t know what to do to help.’ Mr Cross, who worked for Merthyr Tydfil council, was one of six children. Illness: Mr Cross cared for Mrs Cross as she battled a lung condition for nine months before her death . Mourning: More than 1,000 well-wishers attended the funeral for the couple at a local church . His sister Yvonne Thornley, 57, said: ‘They were a devoted couple and just lived for one another. ‘It’s . very sad for all of us. They were both lovely people and we will miss . them terribly. They were so in love from the day they met.’ More than 1,000 people attended the couple’s funeral at St John’s Church in Cefn Coed last Monday. Mr and Mrs Cross’s niece, Sophie Jones, paid tribute to the pair on Facebook. ‘Really . don’t know how I’m going to get over the fact I won’t see you,’ she . wrote. ‘Life is so cruel at times.

Dozens of senior politicians are involved in a  controversial ‘back-door  subsidy’ through which political parties and trade unions have been handed almost £4million of taxpayers’ money. Nick Clegg, Francis Maude and Jeremy Hunt were named yesterday among almost 250 MPs who funnel public money to their parties by renting offices from their local constituency associations. Roughly one-third of all MPs have been involved since the election. Ed Miliband’s policy chief Jon Cruddas and frontbenchers Luciana Berger and Kevin Brennan are among a number of Labour MPs who have rented their offices from trade unions using public money. In many cases the unions have donated cash to the MPs concerned. Hundreds of MPs have been using taxpayer-funded expenses to rent offices from their own parties. The arrangements are within the rules but will now be reviewed . On average, the rents charged by constituency parties are  higher than those charged by private sector landlords used by other MPs. The highest Cabinet claimant is Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who has billed the taxpayer £43,232 to rent an office from his local party. The figure is three times the £14,156 average claimed by MPs who rented from private landlords and the money has gone to  Kingston Lib Dems. It could be used to help Mr Davey fight  for re-election.. Big Tory claimers include Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, who has billed the taxpayer £32,187 to rent an office from his constituency association in Horsham. All the figures represent total claims since the election. In total, the deals involve more than £3.7million of public money being diverted to political parties and unions since the election. Members of the Cabinet have claimed almost £300,000 between them. Tory chairman Grant Shapps (left), Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan were among those to rent offices from their own parties . The arrangements are within the . expenses rules, but critics say it  gives sitting MPs an unfair . advantage over their rivals, who do not enjoy what amounts to a subsidy . from the taxpayer. The . Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) yesterday announced . it would review the arrangements to see if the rules need to be . changed. ‘Our rules allow MPs to rent from a political party,’ said chairman Sir Ian Kennedy. ‘But we require an extra assurance from MPs if they do so: an independent valuation that the lease represents the market rate. ‘As part of a broad review of accommodation support, Ipsa will consider whether, even if the individual leases are appropriate, the cumulative effect means we need to reconsider this aspect of the rules.’ On average, those renting from their local parties claimed about 5 per cent more. Ipsa said the difference between the cost of the leases was one of the things it would be looking at in its review. Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the existing rules were unacceptable. ‘It’s one thing if a local political party offers their MP free use of an office, but quite another for it to be sending taxpayers an annual invoice for thousands of pounds,’ he said. ‘Often this is space that would not in any case be available to anyone else on commercial terms. ‘It’s effectively a back-door subsidy to political parties that is exploiting an allowance meant to assist MPs in their work serving their constituents, not boost the coffers of their re-election campaign.’ He described it as ‘little more than a sneaky way of channelling taxpayers’ cash into party coffers’. Sir Ian Kennedy, Chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said the watchdog would look again at the rules . Ipsa said 244 MPs have claimed expenses for constituency offices rented off their local party since the election. Another ten Labour MPs have rented offices from unions, including six who have arrangements with Unite, Labour’s biggest donor. Mr Cruddas has claimed £20,475 since the election for an office he rents from Unite. Since becoming an MP he has received £156,742 in donations from the union. MPs who have been involved in constituency office deals since the election include 32 ministers, of whom 14 attend the Cabinet.","Hundreds of MPs use expenses to rent from their own political party .

David Cameron last night condemned the ‘appalling’ and ‘chilling’ slaughter of innocent civilians in Sri Lanka as he and Prince Charles arrived there for the Commonwealth summit. The Prime Minister flew into a diplomatic firestorm after demanding that President Mahinda Rajapaksa hold a new inquiry into his regime’s human rights abuses. But Mr Cameron’s hosts hit back, accusing him of behaving like a colonial bully. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron and Witham MP Priti Patel, walk through Kolkata, India, where they visited the Howrah Bridge which was built by the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company . The Prime Minister is due to defy Mr Rajapaksa today by becoming the first world leader to visit Jaffna in the Tamil north of the country since Sri Lanka became independent in 1948. He will then meet Mr Rajapaksa and warn that he has ‘serious questions to answer’ about the murder of 40,000 civilians at the end of the civil war in 2009. Mr Cameron has faced pressure to boycott the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. But he seized on footage smuggled out of Sri Lanka, which showed the regime shelling civilians in a supposed no-fire zone and the execution  of prisoners. David Cameron is visiting India for a two days before travelling to Sri Lanka for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting . 'These are chilling images of appalling acts and they need to be properly investigated,’ he said. ‘There are legitimate accusations of war crimes that need to be properly investigated.’ He said the footage screened by Channel 4 has been ‘verified’ as true by the United Nations.Mr Cameron added that the Tamil Tiger terrorist group, which specialised in suicide bombings, ‘did appalling things as well’. But he said the onus was on Mr Rajapaksa to come clean ‘about how the long war ended and the appalling scenes we’ve seen on television of thousands of innocent civilians being killed at the end of that war’. Mr Cameron added: ‘Part of my message to President Rajapaksa is he should be seizing the opportunity to win the peace.’ Mr Rajapaksa hit back, insisting he has ‘nothing to hide’ and seeking to justify the killings on the grounds that violence has now ended. ‘I will be meeting him and I will also have to ask some questions,’ he said. ‘If anyone wants to complain about a human rights violation in Sri Lanka – whether it be torture, whether it be rape – we have a system. ‘People were getting killed for 30 years. At least after 2009 we have stopped it. There is no killing in Sri Lanka today.’ Sri Lanka’s information minister said the Prime Minister only condemned human rights abuses there in order to pander to Tamil voters in the UK. Keheliya Rambukwella added: ‘We are a sovereign nation. You think someone can just make a demand from Sri Lanka! We are not a colony. We are an independent state.’ Mr Cameron denied that he was lecturing a former colony. ‘We are two sovereign governments, this is 2013, and we should have these sorts of frank conversations,’ he said. Mr Cameron is due to visit a refugee camp and a Tamil newspaper that has suffered censorship and oppression by the regime, but Downing Street aides believe Sri Lankan officials may try to prevent him going to the north of the country.

Members of an Oxford University drinking society were branded ‘repugnant and sexist’ yesterday for organising a pub crawl in which girls dressed as foxes have to ‘evade mauling’. The Black Cygnets Society at St Hugh’s College sent invitations to the female first-year students its members consider to be the most attractive. The ‘Fox Hunt’ event involves male students, or ‘Huntsmen’, dressed in red jackets chasing the women ‘Foxes’ dressed in short skirts and fox ears. Invite: An Oxford University drinking club has been branded 'repugnant, sexist and secretive' after organising a 'fox hunt' through the city with girls trying to avoid a huntsman's 'mauling' An emergency meeting of St Hugh's JCR student body this week condemned the hunt after a motion proposed by Carenza Harvey (above), a first-year invited to be a 'Fox' The invitation said: ‘To evade mauling, Foxes must pass the following obstacles with Huntsmen in pursuit’, then lists nine pubs they must visit and the drinks they must consume. The ‘Foxes’ have to drink hot punch, cider, white wine, red wine, Smirnoff Ice, gin and tonic and sambuca, before arriving at a tenth and final bar called Wahoo, referred to in the printed invitations as ‘Wahoo Foxhole’. St Hugh’s was founded in 1886 as a women’s college and did not accept men until 1986. Graduates include Home Secretary Theresa May and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The college’s principal, Dame Elish Angiolini, said yesterday: ‘This college was founded to secure equality  for women. ‘We are utterly appalled that any member of our community would consider belonging to, or participating in, this repugnant, sexist and secretive group. ‘Any student involved in the distribution of material of this kind, or participation in any of this group’s activities, will be subject to the college’s disciplinary procedures.’ The Black Cygnets were banned from college premises in 2008 after an outcry, but reorganised the annual ‘Fox Hunt’ in 2011 in the college bar, resulting in one student being banned from the college bar and fined. Last year the society’s members were warned that strong action would be taken against them if they repeated the event outside the college and it resulted in a complaint from the public or the police. This year’s event is due to start from the back gate of the college tonight at 7.30pm for, according to the invitation, ‘the Huntsmen to pick up the scent’. An emergency meeting of St Hugh’s JCR student body this week condemned the hunt after a motion proposed by Carenza Harvey, a first-year invited to be a ‘Fox’. The Black Cygnets are a drinking society at St Hugh's College,Oxford. They were officially banned in 2008 . She said: ‘The language was inherently sexist and offensive. The girls who are invited are picked purely on their looks, which creates a very destructive and dangerous atmosphere. ‘The dress code unavoidably and unashamedly generated a sexist and demeaning predatory feel to the evening. It also, disturbingly, creates the impression that women are only animals, to be objectified, while the men hold the upper hand as humans.’ The motion supporting the ‘college in all of their inquiries to render effective the ban on the Black Cygnets’ was carried. One student who attended a previous event said all the women were willing participants and did not have to turn up just because they were invited.","Members of the Black Cygnets drinking club organised 'repugnant' event .

Shocking: Shannon Dodson, 42, has been arrested for allegedly drowning her son and setting his little body on fire . A 42-year-old woman who admitted to drowning her son before setting his body on fire just four days after threatening to take his life has been arrested. Colorado's Shannon Dodson allegedly drowned  Jude Murray . Gomez, five, in a bathtub last Friday, then put him on a bed and set the . mattress on fire. Firefighters found Jude 'wrapped in a [smoldering] . blanket' and 'between a bed and a wall' at Dodson's Colorado Springs apartment. Emergency crews found the woman, who had a history of homelessness, 'naked, wet and sitting up with her arms wrapped around her knees in a hall closet'. They also found a bathtub full of water and half a bottle of sleeping pills in the kitchen of the East Pikes Peak Ave apartment. A pill was also found in the bedroom with several burned matches. Crews tried to resuscitate the little boy, but he died at the scene. When investigators interviewed Dodson at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs the next day, they asked her if she knew why they were there. 'Because I killed my son,' Dodson responded, according to KKTV. The interviewing officer also wrote in the arrest affidavit: 'Ms. Dodson gave no further details of this incident, started to cry, and said that she shouldn't have done it and didn't know why she did it. 'Ms. Dodson also said she thought they would go together...that she couldn't believe she did it.' Devastating: Emergency crews found the body of Jude Murray Gomez, five, 'wrapped in a [smoldering] blanket' and 'between a bed and a wall' Angel: Jude's family said in a statement he ' had a way of making the room brighten up when he walked in' According to the arrest affidavit, one . of Dodson's adult daughters told police that during a conversation four . days before the fire, her mother said she wanted to kill Jude and then . herself. Her daughter said she spoke with her mother further about it, . and her mother told her she wouldn't do it. An aunt also told police that the . boy did not like to bathe at Dodson's home because 'she liked to dunk . his head under the water.' While police are still working to establish a motive in the killing, Denver Westword reported that Dodson was embroiled in a custody battle with Jude's father, Jude Thaddeus Gomez. Gomez had filed for custody of his son last year. Jude's grandmother, Jillian Gomez, had full custody of the boy at the time of his death. Dodson was allowed visitation rights three days a month, according to Denver Westword. Damaged: Family members said Shannon Dodson, right, did not have custody of her son Jude, left, and was in and out of homeless shelters . The incident happened in Shannon Dodson's apartment at the Hill Park complex in Colorado Springs, pictured . However, she violated the terms of . the last get-together - which proved fatal for Jude - by failing to . return the boy to his grandmother after three days. When Dodson didn't show up to a prearranged handover time on November 3, Jillian contacted the Colorado Springs Police Department. She said the cops said they couldn't get involved in a civil . matter and referred her to the court system. 'It just seems like a nightmare,' she told Denver Westword. 'He was a dear little boy...and we miss him dearly.' Jude's uncle, Juan Gomez, said this could have been avoided if authorities stepped in earlier. 'This was preventable on so many levels,' he stated before asking, 'Who dropped the ball?' However Barbara Miller, a Colorado Springs Police Department spokeswoman, said a welfare check was done on November 3, according to Fox 21 News. She said the report indicated officers were not able to make contact with Dodson or Jude, but did speak with a neighbor who told them they had seen the two earlier in the day and both appeared to be OK.

Grieving family: Jude's grandmother Jillian Gomez (left) had custody of the boy, while Jude's uncle Juan Gomex (right) said the incident was preventable . Court records indicate that Dodson had a history of homelessness. A court-appointed guardian had also recommended an evaluation of the woman for 'possible mental health issues.' On Wednesday, Westword published a statement from the little boy's relatives: . 'There was something about that little boy that was so special. He touched everyone's heart that ever met him even if it was just a few minutes. He was a joy to be with and loved everyone,' it said. 'He had a way of making the room brighten up when he walked in. He was so polite and was so kind and smart beyond toddler years.' Dodson is being held without bond in El Paso County jail. She has been charged with first-degree murder.","Shannon Dodson, 42, allegedly drowned her son, five, in a bathtub then put him on a bed and set the mattress on fire on November 8 .

Lawyers for a Mexican drug cartel enforcer currently facing trial in the U.S. for the murder of two American citizens are attempting to get their man freed on the grounds that police south of the border used torture to get a confession from him. Arturo Gallegos Castrellon, 32, is accused of killing two Americans, an employee at the consulate in Juarez and her husband, during a March 2010 drive-by shooting. Attorneys for Castellon, who is also suspected of killing thousands of people in Juarez, claim he only admitted his guilt after he was tortured for three days by Mexican police who shocked his testicles and raped his wife. Arturo Gallegos Castrellon, 32, is accused of killing two Americans, an employee at the consulate in Juarez and her husband, during a March 2010 drive-by shooting . A federal judge ruled last month that Castrellon’s confession can’t be suppressed, but his attorneys are now planning to challenge that ruling before a jury. ‘Americans are aware that suspects are tortured in Mexico, but I don't think they really know to what extent,’ defense attorney Randolph Ortega told Fox News. Consulate employee Lesley Enriquez, 35, and her husband, El Paso County Sheriff's Detention officer Arthur Haycock Redelfs, were gunned down after they left a children’s party. Their one-year-old baby was found unharmed in the back seat of their car. Authorities believe the victims were mistaken for rival gang members. They claim that Castrellon heads the Barrio Azteca gang, who act as enforcers for drug cartels. Consulate employee Lesley Enriquez, 35, and her husband, El Paso County Sheriff's Detention officer Arthur Haycock Redelfs, were gunned down after they left a children's party in March 2010 . Castrellon, 32, was arrested and interrogated by Mexican police on November 26, 2010. He alleges his testicles were shocked with an electric device, he was hanged by his arms and beaten and his wife was tortured and raped by Mexican agents before he was handed over to FBI agents in Mexico City. There is no indication the FBI took part in the alleged torture, but Ortega claims the confession his client made to FBI Special Agent Lorenzo Perez was ‘the product of torture at the hands of Mexican officials and improper psychological pressure by the FBI agents.’ U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Cardone denied the suppression of Gallegos Castrellon’s confession last month, but Ortega hopes an American jury will refuse to convict a suspect if it believes a confession was coerced via torture. The couple's one-year-old daughter, now orphaned, is cradled by a policewoman in the wake of the 2010 shootings which killed her parents . Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Cooley said even if a jury discounts the confession, there’s plenty of evidence to convict Castrellon. ‘We are not simply relying on a confession in this case,' Cooley told Fox. The arrest of Castrellon and others allegedly involved in the shootings has coincided with a dramatic decline in Juarez’s murder rate. Since the arrest of Castrellon, also known as 'El Farmero' and 'El Benny,' the murder rate in the violent city plummeted from 3,622 in 2010 to 2,086 in 2011, then 751 in 2012. Castrellon's trial is scheduled to begin on February 3 in El Paso Federal Court.

A six-year-old girl who was raped and murdered had been submerged in water prior to her violent death, an autopsy report has revealed. Alanna Gallagher had been immersed in water for a prolonged period before her body was found in Texas in July, according to a coroner's report completed last month. It is unclear whether the little girl was put in the water alive or dead - or whether it was an attempt to wash away evidence. Her body, hair and clothing were wet when she was found and the surfaces of her hands and feet revealed she had been in the water for some time. Brutal death: Alanna's official cause of death has been determined to be asphyxiation from plastic shopping bags placed over her head. She was also immersed in water, a recent autopsy report has revealed . Saginaw Police Chief Roger Macon told the Star-Telegram on Wednesday: 'I don’t know that we’ll ever have definitive answers to the questions you pose. 'All of the theories you list are consistent with avenues we investigated over the summer.' Tyler Holder, 17, is believed to have acted alone when he abducted, raped and smothered 6-year-old Alanna Gallagher in July . A Texas coroner determined that Alanna, who was found dead under a tarp in Saginaw, Fort Worth on July 1, was raped and then smothered with plastic bags. Police believe 17-year-old Tyler . Holder acted alone when he abducted the child, sexually assaulted and killed her before dumping her body. Holder was shot in the throat on July 23 when he . opened fire on police officers as they tried to arrest him, wounding one of them in the groin. The . teenage suspect had survived his injuries and now faces charges of . capital murder and attempted capital murder in connection to the . shooting of a police officer. Holder remains in jail on $1million bail. According . to a report recently released by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's . Office, Alanna's official cause of death determined to be was . asphyxiation from the four plastic shopping bags wrapped around her . head. New documents made public in the case and cited by Dallas Morning News . show that police believe Holder acted alone, but may have used his . mother's car to abduct the child and then dispose of her body. The documents also state that Holder bought a new cell phone two days after Alanna's murder. The . teen gave his old phone to a friend, who told police after Holder’s . arrest July 23 that he had discovered a YouTube search for 'Good kid . porn websites' on the device, as well as images of male genitals and . pictures of the suspect dressed as a woman. 'The three of us': A Facebook image shows Alanna's parents, Laura . and Karl (left) Gallagher with Miles McDaniel (right), who are in a . polyamorous relationship . Anti-social: Holder, who has been described as a trouble-maker, lived opposite Alanna in Saginaw. A street view picture of his home shows two people making obscene gestures at the Google camera . The 17-year-old accused of brutally . raping and murdering his six-year-old neighbor left a note for his mother . that read: 'I love you, I'm sorry,' according to FBI documents. Duct . tape, used condoms and blood-stained toilet paper were also listed as . items found by officers when they searched Tyler Holder's home. However, the first item listed on a receipt of 153 items seized by the FBI, according to KHOU, was a 'sealed letter addressed to Mom with 'I . love you, I'm sorry', and a crumpled up piece of paper with the . words 'Mom I' on it. Holder's . neighbors had described him as a trouble maker who had been involved in . 'criminal mischief', the arrest warrant showed. Classmates . have also described the 17-year-old as 'socially awkward' and in a . Google picture of the suspect's home, two obscured people can be seen . making obscene hand gestures at the Google car camera. It has not been . confirmed if Holder was in the picture. According . to the warrant, Alanna was sexually assaulted and suffocated, before . her wrists and ankles were bound with red duct tape, and her body was . dumped in a tarp less than a mile from her home July 1. When investigators later searched Holder's home, they discovered a . purple Timex watch with pink and green flowers on it, which matched the description of the timepiece Alanna's parents had given her so the girl would know when to come home while playing outside. Girls' necklaces . and jewelry, latex gloves, computers, digital . cameras and a journal were also seized. Boyfriend: Patricia Hustede banned Holder from her home after he started dating her daughter, Cassie . Officers were able to trace a roll of toilet paper found with Alanna's body to Costco, which Holder's mother was a member of. Originally, Saginaw Police had said . they had no specific suspects, but the affidavit suggests Holder was . under suspicion almost immediately, according to 8 News. Within . hours of Alanna’s body being found, officers reported seeing Tyler . Holder 'pacing up and down the sidewalk', the affidavit says. Residents . informed police Holder had told them it was Alanna’s body that had . been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of . the victim. The next day, as officers searched the Gallagher home, Holder was seen standing across the street watching. Tragic: Six-year-old Alanna Gallagher was found . bound and gagged. The youngster had been raped. Right, Charles Lodotto, . who Holder allegedly opened fire on, hitting the officer in the groin . Holder . was questioned early in the investigation and told police on the day of .

The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,' Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden. But . video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling . Brook Drive did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had . said. When they analyzed his mobile phone, they found pictures of him with a garden hose in a sexual position. During an interview, Holder had admitted that he had sex with other men. On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were later notified that it matched evidence found on Alanna's body. Four days later, officers arrived at . Holder's home in unmarked cars. Neighbors heard them pounding on the . door shortly before multiple shots rang out. Charles Lodatto, an officer who was . wounded during the confrontation, was shot in the groin and the bullet . hit an artery and broke into pieces. The . probable cause affidavit for Holder’s arrest offered gruesome details about the suffering inflicted upon . Alanna, who went missing on July 1. Heartbreaking: The arrest comes after Alanna's body was found tied and partially naked with a bag over her head under this tarp in the street. A 14-year-old boy found her body .

A pair of jet bracelets have been discovered in a Roman child's coffin that has been prised open for the first time in 1,700 years, MailOnline can exclusively reveal. The bracelets are thought to have belonged to a young Roman girl who was buried in the small lead coffin, which was recently unearthed in a field in Leicestershire. A team of scientists had hoped to find a keepsake and the bones of the person who was laid to rest in the casket, but said the discovery of the bracelets is ‘very unusual’. Two jet bracelets have been discovered in a Roman child's coffin that has been prised open for the first time in 1,700 years. They are thought to have belonged to a young Roman girl who was buried in the small lead coffin, which was recently unearthed in a field in Leicestershire . When the archaeologists first opened . the small lead coffin, they found a thick layer of clay, but . have now uncovered bone fragments and the two bracelets, having ‘fully . excavated’ the casket. Project spokesman Stuart Palmer said: ‘It is . reasonable to suppose [the remains] could be a female – such bracelets . were normally worn by women.’ He also said the size of the bracelets suggests they were worn by the young girl. Chris Wright, who found the coffin (pictured in . black in the left-hand image) watches archaeologist Rob Jones (in white) removing clay from the coffin. Experts at Archaeology Warwickshire . (right) are examining the 1700-year-old Roman child's coffin found in a . field and hope to discover keepsakes inside . Experts believe the child buried in the coffin was a little girl, based on the discovery of the tiny bracelets (one is pictured) but they will also analyse the bone samples found to be certain . The . child is as yet unnamed, but archaeologists want to show their respect . for her by giving her a Roman name and have picked a number of options . they want the public to vote for online. The . names suggested are Oriens, which means 'rise like the sun', Loquor, . which in Latin translates as 'I speak', Aperio, meaning 'reveal', Addo, . meaning 'inspire', Accendo, which translates as 'illuminate' and . Parvulus, which means 'infant'. Mr . Palmer said child burials from the time do not often survive in the . ground and that the lead coffin preserved the remains, which is unusual. A 1,700-year-old lead coffin, thought to contain the remains of a Roman child, has been found by a metal detecting club in a field in Leicestershire . The clay inside the coffin will be analysed by scientists: Project spokesman Stuart Palmer said because the material has been sealed inside a lead coffin, it can be compared to a time capsule . The bracelets discovered in the coffin are extremely unusual and it is not known whether it was common for Roman girls to wear them, as so few burials of this kind have been found . ‘Adding the jet bracelets makes it . very unusual,’ he said, explaining it is hard to know whether wealthy . Roman children typically wore bracelets of this type, as so few burials have been . found. Speaking before the bracelets were discovered, Mr Palmer said the coffin can reveal so much about life at the times. 'Because . of the sealed environment within the sealed lead coffin there is . trapped evidence that would otherwise have been removed. It’s like a . time capsule,’ he said. ‘Chemical . testing can tell us a lot. We may even be able to establish a cause of . death if there is some chemical signature for it,’ he added. The coffin was found by metal detecting enthusiast Chris Wright in a field in Leicestershire last month. The casket was discovered in a field in Witherley, Leicestershire, but its location was kept secret until the coffin was removed, as experts feared that grave robbers might steal or damage the find . Archaeologist Rob Jones (pictured) removes the . top layer of clay from inside the coffin. A collection of fragments . unearthed from around the coffin, believed to be nails used in the outer wooden part of the coffin, are pictured right . Since . then, it has been cleaned by experts from the Archaeology Warwickshire . group and the University of York, who will now take several months to . analyse the contents. Dating . processes confirmed the child was buried up to 1,900 years ago, while . the coffin’s lead lining suggests she was born into a wealthy . family . Mr Wright said he was stunned to stumble across the find. 'My initial surprise was followed by shock and awe. It’s different from the old coins we usually find.' Archaeologists . have no plans to return to the site where the coffin was found as they . do not believe there are any other items of interest in the area. After the analysis is complete, the coffin is likely to be re-buried unless it is found to be historically significant. The coffin has been cleaned by experts from the Archaeology Warwickshire group and the University of York, who will now take several months to analyse the contents (pictured) Members . of a metal detecting club stumbled across the coffin when they were searching a . field in west Leicestershire, about two miles away from where a Roman . settlement and fort that is known to have existed. Mr Wright, 30, a surveyor, said: 'I cannot describe how it feels to find something like this. You spend hours walking around fields, sometimes with little reward and then you find something this. 'It is incredible, it makes all the hours worthwhile, it makes you feel so good. 'We had been at it all day and then got a signal - it was quite deep so I ""ummed and ahhed"" about whether to just ignore it and move on,'he said. But luckily Mr Wright let curiosity get the better of him and began to dig. 'I was digging like mad when we began to see what it was - not in a way that might damage the item I must add - but just in an excited way,' he said. 'It would be great to have questions answered such as why a child should be given such a high status burial and why the burial took place there. 'But perhaps these are questions that may never be answered.' The lead coffin is thought to hold the remains of the child of a very wealthy individual as it is estimated the casket would have cost the equivalent of about £200,000 in the third century AD . David Hutchings, 47, founder of DIGGING UP THE PAST metal detecting club said: 'It was about four feet underground on a field but the coffin was made of lead so we had no problem finding it. After digging down and discovering it was a coffin, they called the police and a vigil was set up at the site to protect it from grave robbers. Mr Hutchings said: 'We assumed there were human remains in there so we contacted the police and they got in touch with the archaeologists from Leicestershire County Council, who also came out. 'It seems to be third century Roman and because of the east-west alignment we think it was a Christian burial. The coffin is thought to hold the remains of the child of a very wealthy individual. 'It’s a lead coffin and we think it would have cost the equivalent of about £200,000, so it was paid for by someone very wealthy,' said Mr Hutchings.

Ministers could take charge of one of Britain’s biggest social services departments after failing to protect children. Birmingham City Council has been repeatedly condemned as ‘inadequate’ by inspectors, and its children’s services will be taken over by the government if it fails to improve. The move, which follows several high-profile deaths of children in the city, including Khyra Ishaq and Keanu Williams, was backed by Collette Elliot, who sued the council for failing to protect her from her abusive prostitute mother when she was a child. Birmingham City Council's care of children has been branded 'inadequate' for years, and was heavily criticised over the death of Khyra Ishaq who died aged seven, after being starved by her mother . Oftsed inspectors will be sent into Birmingham’s children services later this month, and if they find no improvements Education Secretary Michael Gove will send in officials from Whitehall. The Department for Education said: 'We have warned Birmingham that unless Ofsted identify signs of improvement in their next inspection, we will take further action.' In a speech this week Mr Gove admitted that to date the government had ‘not yet intervened vigorously enough’ to protect the most vulnerable children. He said: ‘We have not intervened to rescue those children who have been suffering the most in our society. Education Secretary Michael Glove has vowed to intervene directly where services fail to protect children . ‘My time in politics so far has been punctuated by moments when all of us have been left speechless - because a child’s cries were never heard.’ They included Khyra Ishaq and Keanu Williams, he said. Two-year-old Keanu was murdered by his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth  in 2011, after social services allowed unqualified workers and students to conduct key reviews into his safety. A serious case review into his death found authorities failed at ‘fundamental levels of care’, missing ‘horrifying’ cruelty. Khyra died in May 2008 after being starved to death by her mother and stepfather. Birmingham City Council was told of her plight four months before she died. Khyra and her five siblings were all starved as well as being subjected to a harrowing punishment regime and a five-month detention, involving beatings with a cane. In 2010 the children's services department was served with an improvement notice by the Government in September 2010 after a serious of high-profile child deaths, including the Khyra’s death. Peter Hay, head of the children’s services department, admitted there had been problems in the past but urged ministers to ensure the council remained in involved in its running. ‘I think there's got to be a role for the city council - because it can bring the relationships and the money and the investment,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ‘But it can't do what it's always done and I absolutely respect that the Secretary of State has a very difficult decision because there are no easy answers here.’ Two-year-old Keanu Williams (left) was beaten to death by his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth (right). A review into his death found his case was dealt with by unqualified staff and students . Last month Birmingham was branded a 'national disgrace' by Ofsted's chief inspector, who said the city is one of the worst places to grow up in the developed world. Sir Michael Wilshaw highlighted the infant mortality rate in Britain’s second city, which is higher than Cuba's and almost twice the national average. He singled Birmingham out in a scathing report that found 20 areas in England where councils do not have ‘the most basic acceptable practice in place’. Sir Michael blamed Birmingham, where a third of children live in poverty, for ‘failure of corporate governance on a grand scale’. Collette Elliot, 36, who sued Birmingham council over abuse by her prostitute mother, backed ministers taking control . A woman who sued Birmingham City . Council for failing to stop her mother abusing her backed the idea of . the government seizing control of social services. Collette . Elliot, 36, said she wanted ministers to ‘see for themselves what’s . going on’ and uncover who is to blame for the culture of failure. Last year she sued Birmingham Social Services claiming social workers repeatedly overlooked  warnings about her mother’s abuse. It came after she unearthed social worker records which showed staff had serious concerns about her mother. Collette said her mother would have sex with men while she slept in the same bed. Collette, who is now married with four children, was also sexually abused on many occasions by her mother’s clients. Her mother, Maureen Batchelor, died last August of cancer at the age of 60. Collete said: ‘I’m so glad that the Government are planning to take over the children’s services in Birmingham. ‘It is a chance for them to see for themselves what’s going on, in my opinion there is too many cover ups. ‘The social workers are saying there is no one to blame well there is, it is them, and the Government will now see this. ‘It . is such a good idea they’re taking over and as I am campaigning for the . laws to be changed, hopefully this will happen faster once they see . what is really going on. ‘I . was abused since the 70s, which is when social services started to fail . me, and now we are in 2013 and nothing has been changed, it needs to . stop.’ Collette, pictured with her mother said her vile mother Maureen Batchelor, said her mother would have sex with men while she slept in the same bed . Collette, who still . lives in Birmingham where she was brought up as a child, said: ‘My . mother left me with mental health issues and ruined my childhood. ‘She . abused me, she found it funny to make me eat my dinner with a pot of . ketchup dripping from my head and would have killed me after holding a . knife to my throat if a neighbour didn’t pull her off. ‘I . really can’t remember how early it started but I was in and out of care . all the time and remember being swung around rooms by my hair. ‘I . never knew my dad, he was one of my mother’s clients, she didn’t even . know him apparently, and I grew up with my mum and step-dad. ‘I . turned into the black sheep of the family, I was the one who reminded . my mum of her past, which is why I think everything happened to me. ‘I . received an out of court settlement, not because they weren’t admitting . liability but because of legal advice and I was awarded £20,000.’","Michael Gove says government has not 'intervened vigorously enough'

Alzheimer's could one day be diagnosed by a simple eye test. The disease is thought to kill cells in the eyes at the same time as it kills cells in the brain. This means it may be possible to spot dementia via an easy and inexpensive test at an optician’s. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages. Techniques used in diagnosis, including memory tests and brain scans, are far from perfect and definitive proof only comes on examining the brain after death. Simplifying and speeding up diagnosis could mean that many more people get the help they need. US researchers capitalised on the fact that the retina, the light-sensitive ‘film’ at the back of the eye, is a direct extension of the brain. It is also the only part of the brain that is readily accessible. In tests on mice, layers of the retina were up to 49 per cent thinner in animals genetically-engineered to develop Alzheimer’s, compared with healthy creatures of the same age. Researcher Scott Turner, of Georgetown University in Washington DC, said: ‘The retina is an extension of the brain, so it makes sense to see if the same pathologic processes found in an Alzheimer’s brain are also found in the eye.’ It is thought that when brain cells die in Alzheimer’s, leading to shrinking of the organ, they also die in the eye, leading to thinning of the retina. Dr Turner told the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in San Diego, California, that the research is still at an early stage and he still has to prove that the same thing happens in people. If it does, it may be possible to use equipment already used to detect other eye conditions to spot Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages. Image shows CT scans of a brain with Alzheimer's . The eye scan could also be given to track how well a drug is working – or even to predict who is going to develop the disease in years to come. Dr Turner said: ‘Changes in the brain are found ten to 20 years before the onset of dementia. Retinal thinning may similarly predict impending Alzheimer’s disease but this is speculation so far.’ Those given early warning could change their diet or do more exercise in an attempt to keep their brain healthy for as long as possible. Dr Laura Phipps, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘There is increasing evidence linking a loss of retinal cells to Alzheimer’s disease, and it’s positive to see this line of research being followed up. ‘This early-stage study, which is yet to be published in full, was carried out in mice, and further research will be necessary to determine whether changes in the retina found here are also found in people with Alzheimer’s. ‘Diagnosing Alzheimer’s with accuracy . can be a difficult task, which is why it’s vital to continue investing . in research to improve diagnosis methods.’ In tests on mice, layers of the retina were up to 49 per cent thinner in animals genetically engineered to develop Alzheimer's, compared to healthy creatures of the same age . Dr Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘It would be great if we could simply look into someone’s eyes to see if they had Alzheimer’s but unfortunately spotting the disease is a lot more complicated than that. ‘This study builds on existing evidence linking the loss of cells in the eyes to dementia but, whilst a link could provide a useful and non-invasive aid to diagnosis, it’s important to stress that this study looked at mice and therefore the results may not be the same in people. ‘Much more research needed in humans so that we can spot Alzheimer’s early and stop the disease in its tracks.’","Currently Alzheimer's disease can only be diagnosed for certain by studying a patient's brain after their death - other techniques involve memory tests .

If the same is true in humans, an eye test could indicate if a person has dementia and whether drug treatments are working ."

Convicted: Concert pianist Robin Zebaida was found guilty of groping a 15-year-old girl while simultaneously French-kissing her mother . An internationally renowned concert pianist has been found guilty of groping a 15-year-old girl while simultaneously French-kissing her mother. Oxford-educated Robin Zebaida, 49, was convicted of sexually assaulting the teenager after he touched her chest and stroked her thigh and bottom as she sat on the sofa in his flat. The girl had accompanied Zebaida and her mother on a date to a restaurant earlier that day, before the trio returned to his flat in St John's Wood, London. The jury at Isleworth Crown Court heard how the love-struck widow had romantically pursued Royal College Of Music graduate Zebaida after meeting him on a Mediterranean cruise, sending him boxes of chocolates and arranging dates in London. She told the court she wanted things to go further and, following their meal out on November 24 last year, had joined Zebaida and her daughter, who had been drinking alcohol, on a two-seater sofa in his flat. His arms were around both their shoulders when, without the mother realising, Zebaida began stroking the girl under her top. 'While embracing them in that way Mr Zebaida, as he brought his hand down on the girl’s hip, put his hand under the top she was wearing on her bare flesh', said prosecutor Mark Gadsden. 'He stroked her there and moved his hand up to her breast, where her bra was, but did not touch her breast. 'He started kissing the mother, ‘smooching’ as the daughter described it, French-kissing. 'The daughter then lay on the floor, complaining of the effects of the alcohol the defendant plied them both with, she had been drinking miniatures, and consumed more than the adults.' Mr Gadsden added: 'He coaxed her back on to the couch and caressed her thigh and bottom in a slow and deliberate way. 'He also kissed her on the neck and she felt unable to stop it happening. 'The mother never saw any of this sexual touching of her daughter and the defendant may have been disinhibited from the effects of the alcohol, the music, the romance.' After he was found guilty by the jury, Zebaida, who had denied the charge, was given a conditional discharge lasting two years and was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register. He was also ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge. Denial: Zebaida, pictured right with his defence barrister Sir Ivan Lawrence outside Isleworth Crown Court, said he had to turn down performance work worth up to £20,000 because of the allegations made against him . During his career Zebaida had taught music masterclasses to youngsters all . over the world with the British Council and was an approved examiner . with the Royal College of Music. His date to an Iranian restaurant had been the fourth involving both the girl and her mother, with the group having previously met at the Steinway studios, where Zebaida was practising, and at the Imperial War Museum. 'We sat on the sofa and he put some music on and we had some alcoholic drinks,' the mother told the jury. 'My daughter had one or two vodka miniatures and I think he had some whiskey. 'He had an arm around each of us and he kissed me, which turned into a french kiss. 'It was a bit of a surprise. 'He had an arm around my waist and an arm around my daughter’s back and French-kissed me several times within bouts of conversation.' The court was told that the teenager had reluctantly shared the sofa-bed with her mother that night. 'She was uncomfortable with Robin and she wanted to leave,' the mother said. Details: The jury at Isleworth Crown Court heard how the love-struck widow had romantically pursued Royal College Of Music graduate Zebaida after meeting him on a Mediterranean cruise, sending him boxes of chocolates and arranging dates in London . 'She told me his hand had been under her shirt and against her stomach.' The mother said that the pair had left early in the morning, despite the defendant encouraging them to stay. 'He said we should stay longer and began cuddling me and started undoing my bra,' she told the court. The girl, whose brother and father were killed in a car crash, later shared her experience with a counsellor three months later, who told police, resulting in Zebaida’s arrest and charge. During his trial Zebaida said the accusation meant he had to decline performance work worth £15,000 to £20,000. 'I was absolutely stunned, shocked and could not comprehend how this could have been made. It made no sense,' he told the jury. The British-born defendant, who has a diploma in physiology and massage, said he did touch the woman’s daughter lightly because of back problems caused by the fatal car crash. 'At the museum she said she had a bit of a sore back and I just touched her and when she played the piano I suggested that she sat a little more straight and just touched her on the shoulder.'","Robin Zebaida, 49, convicted of sexually assaulting teenager in his flat .

The financial crash saw average working families suffer a £1,700 real terms cut in their income, new figures reveal today. But the same time retired households on middle incomes saw their income rise by more than £900, despite the turmoil on the stock markets triggered by the global banking crisis. The Office for National Statistics said private pensions increased markedly from 2007 onwards, while those in work saw wage cuts or freezes. Since the financial crash in 2007-08,m incomes of working households (green line) has fallen, while the incomes of retired households (purple line) has risen) The Office for National Statistics said payouts from private pensions have risen markedly, driving up incomes (at 2011-12 prices) New analysis shows how the so-called ‘median household income’ of average families rises and falls in line with the prospects of the wider economy. Households saw incomes rise as the economy grew, but fell after the recessions of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s. Between 2007-08 when before the financial crisis and latest figures for 2011-12, the median income for working households fell by 6.4 per cent from £27,053 to £25,671 at 2011-12 prices. However the median income for retired households grew by 5.1 per cent over the same period, to £19,253 in 2011-12. Average direct taxes paid by the middle fifth of non-retired households have fallen from £8,700 in . 2007-08 to £6,800 in 2011-12 . The ONS said: ‘The largest driver of this increase was income from private pensions, which grew by 22 per cent. ‘This was partly due to more recently retired people receiving higher incomes from private pensions, on average. ‘The other source of growth over this period was the State Pension which grew by 9 per cent for the middle fifth of retired households.’ All households have seen incomes rise in real terms in the last three decades. In 1977 the average household income was the equivalent of £11,200 in today’s prices, compared to £23,200 in 2011-12. The median household income grew by 2.2 per cent on average every year.

'That’s why we need action in the Autumn Statement to tackle the rising cost of living and ensure we can earn our way to higher living standards for all and not just a few at the top.

A poor village woman searching for oysters in a swamp has found a centuries-old chest filled with gold coins - a fabulous treasure uprooted from an ancient cemetery in the 2004 tsunami. In a story that stirs the imagination, the chance discovery of the chest, covered in coral and oyster shells, has sparked a mini gold-rush to the swamps around Gampong Pande village in the northern Indonesian region of Banda Aceh, which was badly hit by the tsunami. The tidal wave ripped up graves in the ancient cemetery containing the bones of 13th century rulers who were buried with their treasures. Remarkable: One of the gold coins found in the trove that dates back to between 1200 and 1600 . Devastated: The area where the gold coins were found was devastated by the 2004 tsunami . Excitement: The find sparked a mini gold-rush to the swamps around Gampong Pande village . The coins are believed to have been struck between 1200 and 1600 but prior to the devastating tsunami none of the tribes living in the area had dared to interfere with the graves, fearing revenge from the spirits of the dead. But this week, from the swamps surrounding Gampong Pande village, came the astonishing news of the discovery of the chest by a woman searching for oysters. It was found not far from the ancient cemetery that had been virtually destroyed by the 2004 tidal wave. 'The chest was covered in coral and oyster shells which had formed on it since it was carried away into the mud,' said Abdullah, a Gampong Pande villager who uses only one name. When the woman, up to her thighs in thick, oozing mud, pulled open the lid she stared in amazement at its contents - it was filled to the rim with gold coins of varying sizes. Recovery: This picture shows how life gradually returned to normal in the area where the coins were found . 'They spilled out as soon as she opened the chest,' Abdullah told the Jakarta Post. The woman reported the find to the authorities who took possession of the coins - but not before many of them had been plundered by local people. After the discovery, hundreds of people from miles around heading to the area to search for other coins that might have become buried in the swamps following the tsunami. They brought with them simple tools for digging into the mud and scraping sand from the bottom of a river that runs near the site of the ancient tombs. Those lucky enough to find other coins lying loose sold them immediately to gold traders, who paid up to 800,000 rupiah (£40) for each coin, confident they would make a good on-selling profit, given the history of the coins. Gampong Pande village stands in the centre of the first Islamic kingdom of Aceh, in a region ruled by the Meukuta Alam dynasty. A neighbouring kingdom was ruled by the Darul Kamal dynasty, the two groups later merging to form the Aceh Darussalam kingdom, ruled by Sultan Iskandar Muda Johan Pahlawan Meukuta Alam (1590-1636). During his rule, the kingdom established diplomatic relations with England, the Ottoman Empire in Turkey and with the Dutch. An Indonesian historian, Husaini Ibrahim, said that gold coins had been found in the area over the centuries due to the greater population that lived there in earlier times. Between the 13th and 17th century, Gampong Pande village became an industrial area producing various goods that included gold coins - resulting in the village getting its name, which means 'village of the expert or master craftsman'. 'The area should immediately be preserved by the government because it is derelict, despite the fact it is a historical site rich in Acehnese history,' Husaini told the Jakarta Post. He said he was sad to see the slow reactions of the Aceh provincial administration on the discovery of the gold coins. 'All the coins should have been collected by the authorities and compensation paid to the residents who found them,' said Husaini, who feared that many had already been lost to scavengers. To this day, the tombs of the ancient rulers are in a state of neglect, many of them buried in mud from the tsunami. 'We will try to limit the number of residents looking for gold coins in the area,' said Mr Reza Pahlevi, of the Banda Aceh Tourism Agency. 'We've also bought some of the gold coins as samples for further study.'","The trove was found in Gampong Pande village in the region of Banda Aceh .

Health experts have condemned the new GPs contract which means doctors don't have ask patients how much exercise they do. British Medical Association officials were accused of ignoring the 'wonder drug' of fresh air which saved lives and treated dozens of diseases with no side-effects. The doctors' union claimed the question was one of a number of bureaucratic tasks leaving less time for patients. Exercise: GPs no longer to ask patients how often they do physical activity after a questionnaire was removed from their contracts sparking a row . But leading charity Macmillan Cancer Support said the move might send a message that physical activity was unimportant while chief medical officer Jane Maher described exercise as a 'wonder drug.' The row erupted after an email from a BMA official celebrated the removal from the contract of the General Practice Physicial Activity Questionnaire, the Sunday Independent reported. The paper quoted the note: 'No more GPPAQ questionnaires asking ill . patients how many hours they cook or garden; GPs can be clinicians . diagnosing depression rather than ticking the box for a bio-social . assessment.' One health expert blamed 'fuddy-duddy' doctors for an over-reliance on drugs, while William Bird, an expert on physical activity, accused the BMA of acting as a 'block to getting GPs to encourage patients do more exercise. Healthy: fresh air has been described as a 'wonder drug' which treats dozens of diseases with no harmful side-effects . He told the paper: 'For the BMA to dismiss it [exercise] and . almost to laugh at it with the email … it just makes you feel a bit fed . up. They haven't grasped the one thing that could have a huge impact on . outcomes.' Mr Bird, a GP, said activity levels were 'more important than any other . risk factor', including smoking. 'Some GPs are really keen, [but] you . have this block usually in the BMA, where this evidence doesn't seem to . have percolated through – or, if it has, they don't know how to deal . with it.' Exercise even proved effective in . treating breast cancer, he said. 'Gardening may look a bit trivial but . that physical activity could save that women's life.' Treatment: BMA chiefs have been accused of acting as a 'block' to getting GPS to talk to patients about exercise . He revealed he had spoken to 180 London doctors since 2012 and not one of the them knew the recommended guidelines for exercise was at least 150 minutes a week. In a major study published last month in the BMJ journal, research showed that exercise could be considered a 'viable alternative' to drugs given for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke. The BMA told the Telegraph it did believe in the benefits of exercise and that doctors would promote it to patients when deemed necessary. A spokesman for the BMA said that a 'large amount of bureaucracy and box-ticking' introduced last year meant less time talking to patients. Removing these requirements did not mean downplaying the importance of aspects of them, simply that they became a matter for a GP's judgement. NHS England, which negotiated the new contract with the BMA, said: 'The benefits of exercise are not in doubt. The changes are designed to reduce overly prescriptive bureaucracy and free up time for GPs to use their judgement.'","BMA chiefs claim questionnaire was a time-consuming bureaucratic job .

Ministers are under pressure to bring in new anti-begging laws to cope with an anticipated invasion of aggressive street beggars from Romania and Bulgaria. They have been pressed by five local government chiefs and a police and crime commissioner for stricter laws so that intrusive hustlers can be arrested and kept off the streets. In a letter to Home Office Minister Norman Baker, they warned of ‘professionalised, aggressive begging’ which hovers ‘inconveniently, or perhaps conveniently, between high-level anti-social behaviour and low-level criminality’. Five local government chiefs have written to the Home Office asking for tough laws to tackle beggars (file pic) They want tougher clauses written into the Government’s Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill so that beggars face arrest if they repeatedly ignore a new order known as an Injunction to Prevent Nuisance and Annoyance. It is claimed the measure, which replaces Antisocial Behaviour Orders, ‘will bark but won’t bite’. Immigrants . would use an independent Scotland as a ‘barn door’ to set up home in . the rest of the UK, a campaign group has warned. They . would use a more ‘liberal’ migration policy north of the border to head . south – and stopping them would mean border controls that could harm . tourism and business travel, says MigrationWatchUK. Chairman . Sir Andrew Green said the issue must be a ‘red line’ in negotiations if . Scots vote ‘yes’ to independence in next September’s referendum. ‘This would not just be a back-door to the rest of the UK; it would be a barn door,’ he said. The letter was written following growing difficulties in some London boroughs with organised gangs of Eastern European migrants and was signed by leaders of councils in Westminster, Birmingham, Nottingham, Southampton and Slough. It was also backed by West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Bob Jones. Westminster councillor Nickie Aitken said: ‘We are not concerned about working people from Romania and Bulgaria. We are worried about begging gangs coming here to get money. They will start in central London, then they will spread out to Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, and other cities. They will go further afield.’ She added: ‘As things stand, we won’t be able to arrest them.’ The letter has also won support from other local authorities. Susan Hall, Tory leader of Harrow Council in north London, said: ‘The ripple effects of crime associated with new waves of East European immigrants and rough sleeping are already creeping further out across London. ‘They even targeted our Christmas fair on Saturday, where Peppa Pig was appearing. If Peppa Pig is in their sights it doesn’t bode well for the rest of us.’ The concerns come amid increasing pressure on David Cameron over the lifting of British labour market restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians in January. Mr Baker said: ‘We will listen to the views of local authorities regarding antisocial behaviour as we have done throughout the development of the Bill.’ The move comes ahead of an expect influx of beggars from Romania and Bulgaria next year .","Five local government chief have written to the Home Office Minister .

From Mars Bars and Creme Eggs to Eccles cakes and even butter - it seems there isn't a food that avant garde chefs haven't tried to coat in batter and deep fry to create a less-than-healthy snack. But fast food chain KFC has taken gastronomical experimentation to the next level - by deep frying soup. The chicken chain is set to introduce its unusual version of a popular soup dish to its menu in Japan. Experimental: KFC Japan is releasing a deep-fried version of corn potage, a type of popular soup . The company is looking to cash in on the nation's latest culinary obsession - a creamy soup known as corn potage. But instead of serving it in bowls with a spoon, the chain will somehow cover it in its usual secret recipe batter and fry it. The snack will go on sale on Thursday and will be available for a limited time only, say KFC Japan bosses. A KFC source told Rocketnews24: 'We bread the corn potage and cook it to a crisp.' Though the batter turns solid, the inside of the fritter stays soft and creamy. Corn potage is a little thicker than normal soup which is how chefs were able to fry it in the first place without creating a gunky mess. New snack: KFC will be selling the fritter for a limited period after it goes on sale in Japan from Thursday . The dish has become a common fixture in Japanese cafes and it has proved so popular that a popsicle company has expanded its line-up to include a corn potage flavour. The product went on to become such a hit with consumers that stores couldn't keep up with demand. Corn potage is not the first unusual food stuff to be deep fried.

A straight 26-year-old man has opened up about the fact he is still a virgin - not due to religious reasons or lack of opportunity - but because he 'takes sex seriously'. James Ivan Layne, a writer and photographer from Indianapolis, reveals in a candid article for Salon.com that he's a 'pretty typical' twenty-something - a keen fan of 'rock music, Tiger Woods and tattoos' - the one difference is, he's never slept with a woman. The red-head, who says he had girlfriends throughout high school and is now engaged to be married, goes on to explain his reasoning: '[Sex] is the deed that creates life . . . I [take] it seriously. Sticking to his guns: James Ivan Layne, 26, has opened up about the fact he is still a virgin - not due to religious reasons or lack of opportunity - but because sex is something he 'takes seriously' 'I knew, even [as a teenager], that I only . wanted to experience its joy and pleasure with one person, and not until . we were ready. 'What might be even more surprising is . that [I'm not] abstaining because of religion, rebellion or any kooky . anti-sex group. It’s actually a decision I made all by myself.' He says that he has always felt 'ashamed' about his abstinence and only confided in close friends. When the topic came up at work or in social situations he would usually lie or stay silent. 'I'm not abstaining because of religion, rebellion or any kooky anti-sex group. It's actually a decision I made all by myself' The most prejudice, he says, usually comes from 'middle-aged men with a deep love of fried food and Vin Diesel.' But now by speaking up, he hopes to make others feel at ease about 'waiting for the right moment'. 'If you haven’t had sex yet because . you’re not ready, you are not weird. You don’t need to get laid. 'Find a . group of people who let you feel at ease with the decisions in your . life,' he encourages in his public essay, which has attracted mixed responses. Indeed, one commentator wrote: 'Congratulations. You missed your sexual prime. Sex will never be as good as it is when you are 18 . . . [when you can] have bed-destroying marathons.' Perfect match! The red-head has been in a relationship for the past four years with Emily Weis, 24, she is also a virgin - the two plan on tying the knot in the summer of 2015 . However, another added with more encouragement: 'Good for you. Be true to yourself . . .When the time comes, put a do not disturb sign on your front door, take a long vacation, and enjoy!' Regardless of other peoples' opinion Mr Layne says he will stick to his guns. He has been in a relationship with a 24-year-old woman named Emily Weis for the past four years and they plan on tying the knot in 2015. Making them the perfect match, Miss Weis is also a virgin for the same reasons as Mr Layne. 'It’s no wonder we found each other, right?' joked Mr Layne. He says, along with regarding sex as something 'serious', the risk of pregnancy also weighs on their minds. 'I can't wait to have sex. Frankly, my fianee and I will have sex whenever we decide to - whether it's before our wedding or not' The couple say they want to 'play it safe' while concentrating on their careers. 'Yes, there are many forms of healthy protection, but none is greater than abstaining,' Mr Layne writes. 'In . addition to being a full-time wedding photographer, my fiancée is also a . kindergarten teacher, which is a form of birth control itself. Teachers . know what I’m talking about.' Mr Layne says that no intercourse does not mean a 'lack of intimacy, 'sexual behavior' or 'love' between him and his fiancee. They may or may not wait until their wedding day to sleep together. The groom-to-be concludes: 'An important point I must bring up is . that I want to have sex. I can’t wait to have sex. 'Frankly, my fianee . and I will have sex whenever we decide to - whether it’s before our . wedding or not - and when that day comes we will deal with the . ramifications, good and bad.

Trial: A Togolese man went on trial charged with raping and assaulting three adolescents in voodoo exorcism sessions (file photo) The uncle and mother of three teenage girls have been sentenced to 14 years in jail for raping and assaulting them in voodoo exorcism sessions. The man, a 28-year-old from Togo, claimed to have been 'chasing out an evil spirit' when he assaulted his niece and her two older sisters between 2010 and 2011. The victims' mother, 41, was found guilty of complicity as she had even supplied the condoms used in the crime. 'She more or less delivered her daughter to the rapist,' the prosecutor told a court in Bobigny, an eastern suburb of Paris. During the sessions, the man would wash the girls' genital areas, and cut their hands and legs before applying a purportedly magical black powder to the wounds. His sister-in-law was found to have given her consent. The man was arrested in February 2011 after his last rape. He claims that he is unaware of the rapes inflicted on his niece. The victim's lawyer, Daniel Merchat, said: 'This denial is the second rape. It is a rape of the soul.' The prosecutor also said: 'The voodoo belief that was cited is just window dressing,' adding that the man 'does not suffer from any mental illness... he is completely responsible for his acts.' The uncle, whose identity is not known, was sentenced to 14 years; the mother was handed a seven-year jail term. It is the latest in a number of voodoo cases which have emerged in France, which has a large African community, in the past few years. Recently four men were sentenced for holding a young woman captive and torturing her as they believed she was possessed. Tradition: Togolese Voodoo followers slaughter a ram during a ritual to welcome the s new voodoo chief priest in 2006 . Earlier this year Spanish police . broken up a ring that smuggled in women from Nigeria and forced them . into street prostitution by burning them with irons and using voodoo . rituals. The gang tortured the women and scared them with curses to force them on to the streets. Six people, including one woman believed to be a ringleader-  were arrested after one of the women alerted authorities. Last year, a Nigerian people smuggler who used witchcraft rituals to force children to work as sex slaves was jailed for 20 years in Britain. Osezua Osolase, 42, tricked poverty-stricken Nigerian orphans into travelling to the UK with the promise of a better life. But the young victims were raped, sexually abused and subjected to voodoo-style rituals by a child trafficking ring. Osolase, the linchpin of a multi-million pound global sex trafficking ring, used 'juju' magic to control his victims. He told the teenage girls they would die or never bear children if they tried to escape or revealed what had happened to them.","Togolese man found guilty of raping his niece and her two older sisters .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 01:59 EST, 30 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:01 EST, 30 November 2013 . The United States has advised U.S. carriers to comply with China's demand that it be told of any flights passing through its new maritime air defense zone over the East China Sea, an area where Beijing said it launched two fighter planes to investigate a dozen American and Japanese reconnaissance and military flights. It was the first time since proclaiming the zone on November 23 that China said it sent planes there on the same day as foreign military flights, although it said it merely identified the foreign planes and took no further action. China announced last week that all aircraft entering the zone - a maritime area between China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan - must notify Chinese authorities beforehand and that it would take unspecified defensive measures against those that don't comply. Defiant: The US military on 26 November 2013 flew two B-52 aircraft over islands in the East China Sea under dispute between Japan and China, joining a long-brewing fray in the region as it called for a diplomatic solution . Neighboring countries and the U.S. have . said they will not honor the new zone - believed aimed at claiming . disputed territory - and have said it unnecessarily raises tensions. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement Friday that the U.S. remained deeply concerned about China's declared air identification zone. But she said that it is advising U.S. air carriers abroad to comply with notification requirements issued by China. Disputed territory: Screens display a map showing the outline of China's new air defense zone in the East China on the website of the Chinese Ministry of Defense . 'China's air force has faithfully carried out its mission and tasks, with China's navy, since it was tasked with patrolling the East China Sea air defense identification zone. It monitored throughout the entire flights, made timely identification and ascertained the types,' ministry spokesman Colonel Shen Jinke said in a statement on its website. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Steve Warren, said when asked about China's statement, 'The U.S. will continue to partner with our allies and will operate in the area as normal.' Japanese officials declined to confirm details of any flights, but said routine missions in the area were continuing. 'We are simply conducting our ordinary warning and surveillance activity like before. We have not encountered any abnormal instances so far, therefore we have not made any announcement,' Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told reporters in Tokyo. The United States and other countries have warned that the new zone could boost chances for miscalculations, accidents and conflicts, though analysts believe Beijing's move is not intended to spark any aerial confrontations but rather is a long-term strategy to solidify claims to disputed territory by simply marking the area as its own. Strategy: The US flew planes over an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea that includes islands claimed by China as the Diaoyu islands and Taiwan as the Tiaoyutai . June Teufel Dreyer, who specializes in security issues at the University of Miami, said the Chinese government - while backing down from strictly enforcing the zone to keep a lid on tensions - is walking a delicate line because it is faced with strong public opinion from nationalists at home. Sending up the fighter planes Friday was aimed at the domestic audience, and China is likely to send planes regularly when foreign aircraft enter the zone without notifying Chinese authorities, she said.'They will be ""escorting"" the intruding planes, but they are not going to shoot them,' she said.The zone is seen primarily as China's latest bid to bolster its claim over a string of uninhabited Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Beijing has been ratcheting up its sovereignty claims since Tokyo's nationalization of the islands last year. Flight control: A Chinese man reads a newspaper which reports that U.S., Japan and South Korea sent flights through China's newly declared maritime air defense zone, in Beijing, China Friday, November 29, 2013 . However, there are questions whether China has the technical ability to fully enforce the zone due to a shortage of early warning radar aircraft and in-flight refueling capability. The United States, Japan and South Korea all have said they sent military flights into the zone over the past week without notifying China. Japanese commercial flights have continued unhindered - although China has said its zone is not intended to have any effect on commercial flights not heading to China. Dreyer said the U.S. and Japan have kept sending planes into the zone to make good on the message that they are ignoring it. 'They have to do it more than once to show they are serious,' she said. Dreyer said the Chinese government may have miscalculated the strength of the international response to the establishment of the zone, but that China will hold its line in the long run.'The Chinese government is not going to concede the substance,' she said. 'When circumstances are more conducive, they will try to enforce it more strictly in the future. This is a pattern we have noticed for decades.'","The U.S. has advised carriers to comply with China's new maritime air defense zone over the East China Sea .

An Olympic hopeful who had to give up her sporting dreams after breaking her neck has managed to walk down the aisle, and had a baby, thanks to her unflagging determination and the devoted care of her fiancé. Natalie Burr, 30, from Maidstone, Kent landed on her head while trampolining, leaving her paralysed and unable to walk or use her arms. But with the unwavering support of her fireman fiancé, Shane, 35, she went on to walk down the aisle and give birth to baby Holly, now one. With Shane's encouragement and intense physiotherapy, in 2009 Natalie walked down the aisle with her father . Natalie had been trampolining since she was four years old, and dreamed of making it to the Olympics. But in 2007, she was training for the World Championships when she fell during a move. 'I knew I'd broken my neck - I heard it crack,' Natalie says. 'I couldn't move or feel anything. I was terrified.' Natalie's day job as an ambulance . technician meant she knew staying still was crucial, so she asked a . bystander to call her fiancé, Shane. 'I remember saying to him: ""I've broken my neck. You're going to leave me"",' she says. The happy couple pictured together prior to the accident in September 2006 . 'He promised he wouldn't, but I was in . complete shock.' In hospital, doctors discovered Natalie had broken most . of the bones in her neck, and she was put on life support. A week later, a metal plate and bone . from her hip were inserted into her neck. While she was still on life . support, Shane was told the devastating news that she'd never walk . again. 'I couldn't believe it,' Shane says. 'I remember wondering how I'd break it . to Natalie when she woke up. I didn't want her to lose hope - I had to . be strong for her.' Natalie was training for the World Championships when she fell during a move . Natalie stayed on life support for two months, Shane visiting every day. 'Not being there wasn't an option,' he says. Despite doctors warnings that Natalie would be paralysed for life, with Shane's support she was determined to defy the odds. 'I remember my knee moving slightly,' Natalie says. 'I showed Shane and we were really excited.' After just a month in rehab, Natalie defied doctors by taking her first tentative steps. Looking forward to finally putting the accident behind her, she left hospital and returned to work in a desk role. But the couple's challenges weren't over. A year later she was struck down with meningitis, caused by the metal plate in her neck. Surgery meant Natalie was unable to eat for six months, during which time Shane fed her through a tube. Her vocal chords were also damaged so Shane - travelling 140 miles a day to visit in between working as a fireman - could only understand her by lip reading. 'She was the same Natalie underneath, even if she couldn't express herself,' he says. When Natalie finally recovered, the couple began to discuss getting married. 'I was still confined to a wheelchair, but determined to walk down the aisle,' Natalie says. With Shane's encouragement and regular physiotherapy, in May 2009 Natalie walked down the aisle with the help of her father. 'We even managed a first dance, Shane holding me up as we swept around the floor to Take That,' she says. 'It felt like a dream.' The icing on the cake for the couple came in August 2012, when Natalie gave birth to daughter Holly. To help Natalie adjust to motherhood, Shane adapted a buggy to fit Natalie's wheelchair. 'It was incredible to know we'd made it and were a family, after everything we'd been through,' she says. Natalie defied doctors by taking her first tentative steps but was later struck down with meningitis . Today, Natalie - pictured pregnant with Holly - is back coaching trampolining, having defied doctors' predictions .

A twice-divorced couple who have now reunited claim the secret to their happy relationship is their vow to stay unmarried this time around. Beverley Knott, 38, and Lee Stevens, 41, who have three children between them, have pledged to never marry again following two failed marriages to each other. Ms Knott said: 'We feel very privileged to have lived through so much together and now be in a position where we know that marriage doesn’t work for us. 'We are soul mates and we are life partners. We’re just not meant to be married to each other.' Beverley Knott, 38, and Lee Stevens, 41, who have divorced twice and are now back together, say the secret to their happy relationship is to remain unmarried this time . Ms Knott and Mr Stevens became a couple in 1998 after being introduced by friends. Ms Knott, who has a daughter, Lexi, now 16, by a previous marriage, quickly fell for Mr Stevens’ charms and the pair married in September 1998, two months after Ms Knott discovered she was pregnant with their son Lewis. Ms Knott said married life soon brought unbearable pressures. She said: 'I worked as a play leader for my local council right up until I was eight months pregnant, and went back to work in June 1999, two months after giving birth. It was too much and I got post-natal depression. Ms Knott quickly fell for Mr Stevens' charms and the pair married in September 1998, two months after Ms Knott discovered she was pregnant with their son Lewis . The pair reconciled and they remarried on September 12 2004, six years to the day after their first marriage . 'I felt as if I was burdening everyone around me. Things were moving at a million miles an hour and I felt overwhelmed. 'I changed jobs and began working 40-hour weeks, which put a strain on everything. Me and Lee became very distant. Life was just about bills and nappies. 'To get a bit of relief from the pressure I started going out with friends without Lee and that led to very brief affair with another man which only lasted a few months. I told Lee about it straight away and we started a divorce.' Ms Knott and Mr Lee split was finalised in the winter of 2003. Ms Knott said: 'I realised quickly that I’d made a big mistake. I knew I would never get over Lee - never get past him. He would always be there. From left to right, Lewis, 14, Bev Knott, Joshua, 8, Lee Stevens and Lexi, 16, pictured recently, are living together happily . 'He was a great dad, a good man and we had lots of fun. We had just lost our way somewhere.' The pair reconciled and they remarried on September 12 2004, six years to the day after their first marriage. A year later, Ms Knott gave birth to their second son, Joshua, now 8. But once again, the pressures of raising a small child brought with it challenges and the pair, of Kidderminster, began to drift apart again. Bev and Lee, pictured at their second wedding in September 2004, say walking down the aisle just doesn't work for them. 'Our attitude is that marriage is just a piece of paper at the end of the day', they say . Ms Knott said: 'I decided not to go back to work and at home I became a different person. We were rowing over money and raising he children. Had I gone back to work, I might have been able to cope with things but being at home I turned in on myself. 'Things went seriously downhill. At one point Lee came home and said he’d met someone else.' By the spring of 2009, Mr Stevens, who works in car manufacturing, had minimal contact with Ms Knott and was seeing the three children through a contact centre. 'I was heartbroken,' said Ms Knott. 'The only way forward was to arrange things so I didn’t see Lee at all, so together we arranged to do things through a contact centre. 'The distance really helped. I moved to a new address and felt my emotions heal. For the first time in a very long time, I felt like myself again. 'I surprised myself by opening back up to Lee. I asked him out for a drink. It was like old times. 'He told me he thought he had made a mistake leaving our relationship and we got back together.' By the time the second set of divorce papers arrived in June 2010, they knew they would never be happy as a married couple. Ms Knott said: 'It was an opportunity to start again, with a clean slate, so we both signed the divorce papers and were happy when we did. 'We know we can’t be married - it just doesn’t work for us. But we’re incredibly happy together. 'We’ve become a lot more mature through our experiences and are aware now when things aren’t going as we want them to. We are able to recognise the signs and address the problems.' Despite being unmarried, the two remain each other’s next of kin . Ms Knott, who now works as an Avon representative, said: 'We’ve heard people wonder what it’s been like for our children, but they are happy that we’re happy. They’d rather us be happy and unmarried than miserable and married. 'We all love each other, just the same.' Mr Stevens said: 'I’ve known marriage to change people - we’re not the only ones who have experienced this situation. 'I’ve known quite a few couples who have seen things go downhill as soon as they’ve put rings on their fingers. 'It’s horses for courses - the important thing is what makes you happy. 'I respect people who consider marriage to be very important. My parents were happily married for 47 years before my father sadly passed away ten years ago. 'Going down the aisle just doesn’t work for us. It puts unnecessary pressure on people. Our attitude is that marriage is just a piece of paper at the end of the day.'","Beverley Knott, 38, and Lee Stevens, 41, have three children between them .

A woman who had spent a desperate day trying to get home to pick up her sick daughter was given a place on an overbooked flight after the CEO of Delta airlines give up his own seat. Jessie Frank wrote an open letter on her Facebook page about how Richard Anderson decided to free-up the extra seat by sitting in the cockpit with the pilots. She was on her way to collect her daughter, who suffers from type 1 diabetes, from a camp for children with the condition. Mrs Frank was number eight on the standby list, but was suddenly allowed onto the plane and helped with her bag by Mr Anderson. Surprised but grateful: Jessie Frank (left) had been waiting for a flight home to Atlanta all day when the CEO of Delta Airlines gave up his seat for her . After a travel day full of lengthy delays, cancellations, and mechanical failures due to the weather, Ms. Frank wrote that she was relieved to find that somehow, despite being eighth on the standby list, a spot had opened up for her. 'As the plane descended into Atlanta, the flight attendant announced that there was a special guest on board,' Ms. Frank wrote. 'He was riding in a jump seat, because he had given up his place to allow one more person on that flight.' 'Suddenly I realized that 'familiar face' was not an off-duty pilot,' Ms Frank wrote in her Facebook post. 'It was you, the CEO of Delta, vaguely familiar from the safety video. It was you, Richard Anderson, who gave up your seat for me. It was you, the Delta CEO, who helped me with my bag. It was you, acting just like an ordinary Mr. Anderson, who showed me to my seat.' Act of kindness: CEO Richard Anderson decided to use the jump seat in the cockpit in order to free up the extra seat. He did not even tell Ms. Frank who he was . 'You, Richard Anderson, the CEO of Delta, did all that for me, just an average, middle-aged, woman with, as far as anyone at Delta knew, no special reason to get home,' Ms Frank added. 'But more importantly, it was all of your employees that day that did so much helping me to get home -- and now I know why. Because Delta is led by you, Richard Anderson, a dedicated and inspiring leader who so clearly demonstrates, at his very core, that he leads by example, and does not set himself above all those who allow this airline to exist.' Since posting the letter, it has been shared over 1,700 times. In the letter, Ms. Frank says that she really wanted to pick up her daughter, who suffers from Type 1 diabetes, from camp. 'Camp Kudzu gives my daughter five days a year when she feels 'normal,' Frank wrote. Loyal to Delta for life: Ms. Frank says she had been at DC all day long and was eighth on the standby list so was very surprised when a seat opened up just minutes before the flight departed . One thing after another: Ms. Frank had been stuck in Washington D.C. all day and many flights had been cancelled due to mechanical problems or weather so she was lucky to get a seat at all . 'Pick-up day gives me a glimpse into that special world where she's just like everyone else, and she's a little bit of a different person for the rest of the day.' 'By the next day, it's back to the harsh realities of managing a difficult, deadly, incurable disease that kills one in 20 before the age of 18,"" Frank continued. Ms. Frank had been traveling from New York when she had been rerouted to Washington, where she was stuck waiting for hours at Reagan National Airport before being led down the jet way only to be told there were no seats left after all. Then, something happened. A flight attendant paused, talked to someone and then waved her onto to the plane as she was told that room had become available. She wanted to share her story with Delta and reposted her letter on Delta's Facebook page. It has received personal thanks from Delta employees. Delta Airlines confirmed the incident, but said that Mr Anderson wished to avoid the spotlight and would not comment on the good deed. Ms. Frank usually flies Delta and says she doesn't expect to hear from Mr Anderson, but she hopes her letter ends up on his desk so he knows how much she appreciated the gesture. 'I had my special day with my special child. You and your employees gave us both one more day of happiness, and for that, we are both very grateful,' Frank wrote. 'I have always been a loyal Delta customer, but Thursday solidified that loyalty for life!'","Delta CEO gaves up his seat to passenger Jessie Frank .

The kind-hearted New York police officer who hit the headlines a year ago when he famously bought a pair of boots for a homeless man has got his just deserts – a promotion at work. Larry DePrimo won a host of fans last November when a photograph of him kneeling down to give a pair of boots to a homeless man in Times Square went viral and sparked a massive response, with thousands on social media hailing him as an example of the transforming impact of a simple gift. On Tuesday, DePrimo who was nicknamed Boots by his colleagues after last year's incident was promoted to detective. Scroll down for video . Reason to celebrate: Kind hearted NYPB officer Larry (Boots) DePrimo has been promoted to detective a year after he made nationwide news for buying a barefoot homeless man a pair of boots . Act of kindness: Hundreds of thousands of people expressed their appreciation for Officer Lawrence DePrimo last November after the NYPD posted this photo of him on Facebook . ‘It’s a dream come true, this shield is one of the most coveted shields I think in the country, maybe even the world,’ he told the New York Post. ‘I look down and it’s still unreal to me.’ In the wake of last November's incident, DePrimo had appeared on the Today show, where he had credited his . grandfather with instilling in him the importance of generosity. ‘I really didn’t think about the money,’ he said. ‘I said, I don’t care what the price is. We just got to help him out.’ DePrimo had also described the media attention his good deed received as . ‘surreal and extremely humbling.’ DePrimo said he hasn’t seen 'homeless' Hillman since his act of kindness . last November, but said he would still like to meet up with him . ‘It’s . a great experience,’  he said last year. ‘I think it’s a lot about the people, . though, because you see such great comments. People are saying that . their faith in humanity is restored and that’s the biggest thing that I . can take away from all of this.’ The homeless man was later identified as Jeffrey Hillman, 54. He was spotted just days later without the famous boots which he claimed might get stolen if he wore them. Hillman has been . spotted as recently as March still shoeless and with a . sign that reads 'HOMELESS' while panhandling for money in . the streets of Manhattan, even though he lives in a Bronx apartment. DePrimo hasn’t seen Hillman since his act of kindness, but said he would still like to meet up with him. 'Hopefully I’ll be able to meet him and see how’s he doing,' DePrimo said. 'I’d shake his hand and ask him if he still wants to grab that coffee or some dinner.' Responding to a need: Officer DePrimo said he was patrolling Times Square in the heart of Manhattan when he came across the man, who was huddled next to a storefront with nothing on his feet . Though . that famous incident gained DePrimo a lot of recognition, his father, . also Larry DePrimo, was quick to point out that it wasn't the only . reason that he was promoted. 'It’s . important to remember Larry is not becoming detective today because he . done something nice a year ago, his service record also speaks for . itself too,' he said. When DePrimo appeared on the Today show last November he was joined by Jennifer Foster, the 911 dispatcher from Pinal County, . Arizona, who had captured the heartwarming photo on her phone and then . emailed it to the NYPD. 'I knew what I was looking at,' she said. ‘I knew it was remarkable.’ CCTV footage captures the moment that DePrimo purchased the pair of winter boots for the homeless man . DePrimo has cited the influence of his grandfather in motivating him to step forward to engage with the man in need. 'The true inspiration was my . grandfather, and he told me when I was much younger, ""If you are going . to do something, do it 100 percent. And do it, or don't do it at all,'"" DePrimo said. 'And I think that stuck with me my entire life.' DePrimo was on counter terrorism . patrol in Times Square on the night of November 14, 2012, when he encountered the . homeless man who was huddled next to a storefront with nothing on his . feet. The 25-year-old told . CBS that he spotted the man shivering on the cold pavement. 'I went up . to him and I said, ""Buddy where's your socks, where's your shoes?""' DePrimo said. New York Police Officer Lawrence DePrimo and Jennifer Foster, the woman who captured the moment he gave a barefoot homeless man a pair of new boots, were interviewed on the Today show last November . 'He said, ""It's okay officer, I never had a pair of shoes."" And that to me - it took me back a few.' 'It was freezing out and you could see . the blisters on the man’s feet, I had two pairs of socks and I was still cold.’ He watched the man stand up and walk slowly, painfully, down the cold pavement of the sidewalk on the balls of his feet. The . officer went into a nearby Skecher's store and found a $100 pair of . winter boots that he believed would keep the man warm through the . winter. Jose Cano, the assistant manager at . the Skechers store in Times Square, said he discounted the Alamar . Terence shoes from $100 to $75 as he was 'inspired'. Mr Cano, 28, said: 'I've worked in the city for about 10 years and no one’s really sort of taken that sort of initiative.' Snug: A worker at Skechers shows off the type of boot donated to the homeless man . Officer DePrimo said he keeps the $75 receipt from the . boots in his bullet-proof vest, as a reminder that even when things are . tough, some people have it tougher. ‘The . two things that really stuck out in my mind that night was how cold it . was and that this was the most polite gentleman I ever met, and I knew I . had to help him,’ he told TODAY. DePrimo . said he only told his family about the incident at the time, and was . surprised when a friend told him the photo was posted on the internet . some time later. He has . been on the NYPD for 2 1/2 years and is assigned to the Sixth Precinct, . encompassing Greenwich Village and the West Village, and lives on Long . Island with his parents. At the time DePrimo received a set of cufflinks from Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly as thanks for his acts of kindness.","Officer Larry DePrimo won a lot of fans last November after a photo of him giving boots to a homeless man went viral .

Fight: Brian Aitken, pictured, has been banned from seeing his young son for four years after he was found with an unloaded gun he legally owned in the back of his car as he moved house . A desperate father has been banned from seeing his young son for four years after he was found with an unloaded gun he legally owned in the back of his car among his possessions as he moved house. Brian Aitken was arrested in 2009 as he was . moving back from Colorado to New Jersey to be near his child after a . divorce. He was later convicted of possessing a gun and sentenced to seven years' prison. Now the New York University . graduate and digital media entrepreneur is using a crowdfunding website to raise funds so he can write a book about his ordeal and hopefully be reunited with his little boy. The saga began when Aitken's mother called 911 after he arrived with his possessions piled high at her house in New Jersey, but she didn't complete the call. The police arrived regardless and after questioning her she explained that she was concerned for Aitken's welfare following his divorce. The officers then called Aitken, who by that stage had left, and coerced him to return. When he arrived, the officers searched his car and found three locked, unloaded handguns in the trunk. He was then arrested. In his trial, Aitken explained he was in the process of moving from Colorado to New Jersey, which is an accepted exemption under the state's law. He even called the New Jersey State Police before he set off and asked them how to transport his firearms. 'I did exactly what they told me to do,' he said. The jury asked if they could take the exemption into account but the judge refused. The father was convicted and sentenced to seven years prison. Happier times: Aitken, pictured with his son four years ago, was arrested in 2009 as he was moving back from Colorado to New Jersey to be near his child after a divorce . Growing up: Aitken's son, pictured, is now five years old . Because of a change in the law a year prior that upped possession of a firearm from a Fourth Degree Felony to a Second Degree Felony, he was also deemed unfit to see his son. 'After I was indicted of a victimless and violentless charge, with no prior criminal record, a family judge interpreted the charge to mean that I was a violent criminal with access to firearms and that fathers who own guns pose a threat to their children,' he told Ammoland. Although Governor Chris Christie commuted Aitken's sentence after he had spent four months, and his 27th birthday, in prison, his saga continues. He is still labeled a felon and therefore cannot own a gun, cannot vote, and cannot travel overseas because his passport was revoked. Desperate: Aitken, pictured with his new partner Jenna, is determined to get his son back and has raised more than $26,000 on Indiegogo . Supreme Court: Aitken, again pictured with Jenna, wants to take his case to the Supreme Court . More importantly, he is still unable to see his son, who is now five years old, because he cannot meet the harsh restrictions the judge placed on him. Aitken's attorney described the case as a 'perfect storm of injustice,' to Crowdfund Insider . He now travels around the U.S. raising awareness about what happened to him and the huge ramifications it has had on his life. His story has also been covered in print, online and TV media. In his latest push, he is raising funds on crowdfunding website Indiegogo to write a book about his experience and to be able to take his case to the Supreme Court. With a week left in the campaign he has surpassed his initial $20,000 goal but is hoping to double that. On his campaign page he writes: 'Until my case is resolved I can't vote or pass a background check. It's next to impossible to get a credit card or even sign a lease for an apartment. I can't leave the country and I can't see my son. Clearing my name is the first step towards getting my life back... and I can't do it without your help.'","Brian Aitken was arrested in 2009 as he was moving back from Colorado to New Jersey to be near his child after a divorce .

Inheritance: Sian Davies apparently spent £60,000 on funding the Maoist commune where she lived . The woman who mysteriously died while living in a Maoist commune handed over all of her £60,000 inheritance to the extremist sect, it emerged today. Sian Davies received thousands of pounds when her father Alun died in 1970 - but apparently spent most of it on funding the far-Left movement based in South London. When she died, she had just £5 in her bank account and her only possession was a stash of Marxist literature, according to reports. It has also been claimed that Ms Davies' family, from whom she was enstranged, were so worried about her being exploited that they froze her bank account. She died in 1997 after breaking her neck when she fell from a window at the building in Brixton where she was living with cult leader Aravindan Balakrishnan and his other followers. Three other women, including Ms Davies' daughter Rosie, who has lived with the sect her whole life, escaped the property last week. They were yesterday interviewed by police for the first time as officers investigate whether Balakrishnan, known as 'Comrade Bala', and his wife Chanda should face charges. Ms Davies, who was 44 when she died, was brought up in a middle-class family in North Wales and attended the prestigious Cheltenham Ladies' College. She was drawn in to the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought after she moved to London for university in 1977. The group relied on her inheritance to fund itself for many years, leaving her almost penniless, according to the Guardian. Slavery case: Maoists Aravindan Balakrishnan, left, and his wife Chanda, in the wheelchair, outside a 1997 inquest into the death of Ms Davies . Her cousin Eleri Morgan said that Ms Davies' mother decided to freeze her funds in order to stop her giving all her money to the sect. 'I remember her mother saying, ""I had to take the awful decision of freezing her bank account to stop her using that money and going to the cult with it,""' Ms Morgan told The Times. The Maoists were apparently based for a time in a house in Battersea owned by Ms Davies, before she gave them £10,000 to lease their headquarters in Brixton. Her family were unaware that she had had a daughter while living with Balakrishnan, and were not told that she had been left paraplegic after falling from a second-storey window. Members of the sect told her mother that she was on holiday in India, according to the Guardian, and refused to allow doctors to contact her relatives. Cult: Ms Herivel, centre, with fellow member Aishah Wahab, left, and leader Aravindan Balakrishnan, right . Boarded up: The house in South London pictured after the three women escaped last week . One of the three women allegedly held as a slave by a Maoist sect in South London is the daughter of one of the greatest Bletchley Park codebreakers, it has emerged. The father of Josephine Herivel, 57, was John Herivel, pictured, who was instrumental in deciphering the Nazis' Enigma code during the Second World War. But by the time he died two years ago, she was apparently estranged from the family after becoming a radical Leftist in the 1970s and being arrested for assault. Ms Herivel was brought up near Belfast’s so-called 'millionaire row' with her two sisters, Mary and Susan. Her father John, a brilliant mathematician, was recruited from Cambridge University to break German military ciphers at Bletchley Park in January 1940. After the war he published a number of books on his work and moved to Belfast to become a lecturer at Queen's University, before retiring to Oxford as a fellow of All Souls College. In the same year Josephine, then 22, was arrested for assault and obstructing police in London along with a number of young women.When her father died in 2011 obituaries only made mention of his two other daughters, who now live in London. Last week Rosie Davies, 30, escaped Balakrishnan along with Josephine Herivel, 57, the daughter of a Bletchley Park codebreaker, and Aishah Wahab, 69, who came to Britain from Malaysia as a student. The three women were set to be formally interviewed by police yesterday after several days of being assessed by psychologists. Commander Steve Rodhouse said: 'The victims are in the care of specialists who have got great experience of dealing with people who have been subject to trauma. 'We're working to that advice of those experts as to how best to handle those victims, to support them and of course to draw out the evidence we would need to substantiate any prosecution.' He said that there may have been 'many and varied offences' against the women, who were allegedly held captive at various addresses in London, but that their ordeal may not be defined as slavery. 'We need to maintain an open mind on what this particular incident is before we jump to those conclusions and labels,' Mr Rodhouse said. But he added: 'The crucial issue for us is that, on the basis of the information that we've had indirectly from victims, clearly criminal offences have been committed. What we need to do now is to understand that in much more detail.' The commander said that his team had requested documents from the inquest into Ms Davies' death, which was not considered suspicious at the time. 'We have retrieved the court papers, the inquest papers, and we are in the process of reviewing those to see what they can tell us about the police involvement in that inquiry', he said. 'We were not called to the address at the time of Sian's death but we are reviewing what later involvement we had in assisting the coroner to come to that open verdict.' Yesterday a man who was drawn to the Maoist sect but refused to join the commune said that Balakrishnan, 73, had convinced his followers he was a communist Messiah. Flying in: Kamar Mautum arrives at Heathrow . The sister of a Malaysian student allegedly enslaved by an extreme Left-wing sect for decades yesterday into Britain to see her 'before either of us dies'. Retired teacher Kamar Mautum says one of the three captives freed last month is her sibling Aishah Wahab, 69, who disappeared after joining the Maoist faction based in Brixton. She landed at Heathrow with documents said to prove the captive is her sister and now hopes to see her for the first time in at least 30 years. As she boarded a flight from Kuala Lumpur to London to be reunited with her sister, Mrs Mautum said: 'I have felt so choked without her for years and years. 'She was so talented; she was the apple of my mother’s eye. She asked for her on her deathbed.' Miss Wahab is believed to have suffered a stroke while she was allegedly held captive by sect leaders Aravindan Balakrishnan and his partner Chanda. Her sister added: 'This has been a dark age for her and for all of us. I will do anything to bring her home. I want to see her before either of us dies. I am not sure if she will remember me but I am hopeful she will. 'I hope her health is OK and she is receiving all the help she needs.'

The Education Secretary’s new history curriculum for children aged five to 14 will be introduced next year – the centenary of the outbreak of the 1914-18 war. Traditionalists say it demotes studies of both world wars and Winston Churchill to ‘optional’ status. Historians Chris McGovern and Tony Freeman, who were among a range of experts consulted over the curriculum, have launched a petition calling on Mr Gove to reverse his decision ‘as a mark of respect for the fallen’. Michael Gove has been criticised for axeing a requirement for schools to teach about the First World War . Mr McGovern said: ‘It is a national disgrace, and a betrayal of those who gave their lives for this country. The best way to commemorate the war is  to ensure children learn about it in schools.’ In the new curriculum, the world wars and Churchill are listed as ‘non-statutory’ examples of subjects that teachers ‘could’ include in lessons. Government insiders said that  although the new curriculum would be less prescriptive than before, it  would be ‘inconceivable’ for schools  not to devote substantial time to the  world wars.

Winner: Eleanor Catton, 28, has been awarded the 2013 Man Booker Prize for Fiction for her second novel The Luminaries . Fiction's highest accolade, the Man Booker Prize, has been awarded to its youngest ever winner. New Zealander Eleanor Catton, aged just 28, was awarded the £50,000 prize for her second novel The Luminaries at a ceremony in London’s Guildhall last night. The plot is set in 1866 in New Zealand’s gold rush and follows the tale of Walter Moody who stumbles into a secret meeting where 12 men discuss unsolved crimes. Chairman of judges Robert Macfarlane commended the young author and said: ‘It’s awesome. The maturity of this work exists at the level of the sentence. ‘You read every sentence and you are astonished by its knowledge and its poise.’ Judges acknowledged the book has a ‘very slow start’ but praised Miss Catton’s discipline for its structure, with each section being half the length of the last. Mr Macfarlane said: ‘It’s a dazzling work, it’s a luminous work. It is vast without being sprawling. ‘It is beautifully intricate without being fussy. It is experimental you come to realise. But it does not by any means neglect the traditional virtues of storytelling.’ He added: ‘Its story is quite exceptionally compelling. Each section is half the length of its predecessor. ‘The consequence of this is a very slow start and an astonishing accelerating, quickening tilt to the narrative.’ The Luminaries follows Miss Catton’s 2008 debut The Rehearsal, and is the longest work ever to win the Booker Prize at 832 pages.

It is astonishing, it is the longest novel ever to win the Man Booker Prize and the youngest author ever to win it. Though these facts were not playing on our decision. ‘It is an investment, it operates like the best kind of gold mine. You pan and the yields are huge. ‘Once you are on the downslope the pace . is irresistible. One can approach this as a murder mystery with seances, . corpses, law suits and puzzles. The pleasures it yields in simple ways . are immense as well. It pulls you along through.’ He joked: ‘Those of us who didn’t read it on E-readers enjoyed a full body workout.’ It takes the title of longest winning book from Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall in 2009, which was 672 pages.

Many Americans who were held hostage during the Iranian revolution have spoken out against the nuclear deal recently brokered with Iran saying that it is a mistake to trust the controversial Middle Eastern regime. A number of the hostages, including Clair Cortland Barnes, see the negotiations now as no more effective than they were in 1979 and 1980, when he and others languished, facing mock executions and other torments. 'It's kind of like Jimmy Carter all over again,' said Mr Barnes, now retired and living in Leland, North Carolina, after a career at the CIA and elsewhere. Taken outside to display to the crowds: One of the 66 Americans held hostage in the American Embassy in Tehran was walked around the compounds on November 9, 1979, five days after the ordeal began . Chaotic: A majority of the hostages were held for 444 days and it was the end of diplomatic relations with Iran . The hostage crisis began in November 1979 when militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and seized its occupants. In all, 66 were taken hostage. Thirteen were released less than three weeks later in 1979; one was released in July 1980; the remaining 52 were released January 20, 1981. Downfall: The Iranian hostage crisis was cited as the lowest point of then-President Jimmy Carter's term . Retired Air Force Col. Thomas E. Schaefer, 83, called the deal 'foolishness.' 'My personal view is, I never found an Iranian leader I can trust,' he said. 'I don't think today it's any different from when I was there. None of them, I think, can be trusted. Why make an agreement with people you can't trust?' Schaefer was a military attache in Iran who was among those held hostage. He now lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his wife of more than 60 years, Anita, who also takes a dim view of the agreement. ‘We are probably not very Christian-like when it comes to all this,' she said. The weekend agreement between Iran and six world powers — the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany — is to temporarily halt parts of Tehran's disputed nuclear program and allow for more intrusive international monitoring of Iran's facilities. In exchange, Iran gains some modest relief from stiff economic sanctions and a pledge from Obama that no new penalties will be levied during the six months. To be sure, the former hostages have varying views. Victor Tomseth, 72, a retired diplomat from Vienna, Virginia, sees the pact as a positive first step. Tomseth, who was a political counselor at the embassy in Tehran in 1979, had written a diplomatic cable months before the hostage crisis warning about the difficulties of negotiation with the Iranians. A long memory: Former hostage Thomas E. Schaefer, 83, thinks that time has not changed the Iranian leadership. 'My personal view is, I never found an Iranian leader I can trust,' he said . Still, he said in a phone interview Monday that it is possible to cut a mutually beneficial deal with them. 'The challenge is Iranian society and politics is so fragmented that it's difficult to reach a consensus,' he said — a problem that is also present in the U.S. He said he considers the deal 'in a category of an initial confidence measure.' John Limbert, 70, of Arlington, who was a political officer held hostage during the crisis and later became deputy assistant secretary of state for Iran in 2009 and 2010, also supports the deal. He said he does not view it in terms of whether Iran can be trusted, but whether the regime recognizes that a deal is in their own interest. 'I would say there is a consensus among the leadership, and the consensus is, “We like to stay in power. We like our palaces,”’ Limbert said. ‘We've seen the alternatives in Egypt and Tunisia,’ he argued, citing other areas where established regimes have been toppled. Hopeful: Victor Tomseth, 72, a retired diplomat from Virginia who was part of the group held for 444 days, sees the new nuclear pact as a positive first step . He said it's a mistake to be overly pessimistic about the prospects for a deal. 'If we and the Iranians could never agree, then Victor and I and all our colleagues would still be in Tehran,' he said. 'The problem has been that our reality has been for the last 34 years that anything the other side proposed, you could never accept because by definition it had to be bad for us, because otherwise why would they propose it?' For other hostages, though, their experience has led them to the conclusion that attempting to negotiate and expecting Iran to live up to its end of the bargain is a losing proposition. Sgt. Rodney 'Rocky' Sickmann, 56, of St. Louis, then a Marine sergeant, remembers clearly being told by his captors that their goal was to use the hostages to humiliate the American government, and he suspects this interim deal is in that vein. Clair Cortland Barnes, a former hostage, sees the negotiations now as no more effective than they were in 1979 and 1980 when he and others languished, facing mock executions and other torments . 'It just hurts. We negotiated for 444 days and not one time did they agree to anything ... and here they beg for us to negotiate and we do,' he said. 'It's hard to swallow. We negotiate with our enemies and stab our allies in the back. That doesn't seem good.' The deal may also have a direct effect on some of the hostages who have long fought to sue the Iranian government for damages. The new agreement calls for $4.2billion in frozen Iranian assets to be released, which could make it more difficult to collect a judgment on any successful lawsuit. 'And what do we get out of it?' asked Barnes. 'A lie saying, “We're not going to make plutonium.” It's a win-win for them and it's a lose-lose for us.'","Secretary of State John Kerry and other international politicians have struck a deal to temporarily suspend Iran's nuclear operation .

Busy: Steve Chapman, 57, has no recollection of painting the ceiling or cooking meals while asleep . For most people, painting the ceiling is simply a bore. But Steve Chapman doesn't blink an eyelid. In fact, the father-of-two was fast asleep when he scaled a ladder to do the handy-work and went on to cook a meal - all before he woke up. And he cannot remember a thing. Suffering from a rare condition which causes him to sleep for around 60 hours at a time, Mr Chapman, 57, had no idea what he was getting up to until his wife spotted the ladder and the newly-immaculate decor. He can also eat 'dozens' of chocolate bars in his sleep without knowing until he discovers the empty wrappers thanks to the 'Sleeping Beauty' disorder. Officially known as Kleine-Levin Syndrome, it affects around one in a million people and makes them fall into a deep sleep for even months on end. Sufferers - predominantly male - are known to experience flu-like symptoms before abruptly falling asleep. Excessive food intake, hallucinations and an abnormally uninhibited sex-drive can be observed during episodes. Mr Chapman, from Overton, Hampshire, has suffered symptoms for 33 years and says being diagnosed was a 'huge relief'. A machine assistant at banknote printer De La Rue, he said: 'It was very distressing for my wife Doreen. 'She once came home and found a ladder in the lounge - I had been painting the ceiling but couldn't remember anything. 'I would even cook myself things to eat. After one episode, my wife found the wrappers from dozens of chocolate bars strewn across the room.' He describes experiencing a feeling of 'blackness' for two days before his episodes, in which he could be 'active' but have no memory of his actions. Mr Chapman has been able to keep his job by managing his KLS with medication, and is determined to raise awareness about the condition. Treatment: After 33 years, the father-of-two has been diagnosed and needs to follow an intense treatment regime . Medication: With no known cure, doctors can only prescribe stimulant pills like modafinil and amphetamines . But he said he and his two sons - who are both now grown-up - had found it hard to deal with. He was diagnosed by specialists after several misdiagnoses and was even being accused of faking his symptoms for several years. Mr Chapman added: 'The diagnosis has made a huge difference to me.' Though there is no known treatment for the disorder, doctors sometimes prescribe stimulant pills such as modafinil - though this often provokes irritability. Adele Clarke, a founding member of KLS Support UK, said: 'KLS is a strange condition which is very hard for sufferers to live with. 'The more awareness there is, the better.'","Steve Chapman, 57, diagnosed with KLS or 'Sleeping Beauty Syndrome'

More than two decades after Magic Johnson announced that he had HIV, the basketball player says he is still surprised at the impact the news had. The former Los Angeles Lakers player said when he was first told he had HIV he was convinced he was going to die, but advances in drugs has helped Johnson - and millions of others - survive. Johnson, who became the face of HIV/Aids 22 years ago, is now campaigning for more people to get tested for the disease, especially those in black or Hispanic communities. Campaign: Magic Johnson has dedicated his life to raising awareness about HIV over the past 22 years . 'We have to drive people to get tested, . because that's the most important thing,' he told CBS News. 'The stigma and fear . of knowing their status' is holding people back. Johnson admitted that when his team's doctor told him blood results had revealed he had HIV in 1991 he was 'devastated'. 'At that time, people were really dying of Aids. I was just scared to death,' he said. The NBA star began treatment with Dr Michael Mellman and Dr David Ho, a top HIV researcher, who reassured him that newly developed drugs would improve his chance of survival. But it was a meeting with Aids activist Elizabeth Glaser who helped Johnson come to terms with the diagnosis, and influenced his decision to publicly campaign to raise awareness. Legend: NBA star Johnson, pictured here in 1985, was playing for the Lakers when he was told he had HIV . 'Scared': Johnson announces he has HIV at a Los Angeles press conference in 1991. He and wife, Cookie, left, were devastated by the diagnosis . Johnson said that Glaser, whose HIV had developed to Aids, was able to answer questions from him and his wife Cookie, who was two months' pregnant at the time, about living with the disease. 'The one thing she did say was I was . going to live for a long time. And the thing that she asked me to do was . become the face of the disease,' he said. 'She felt it was really . important that I go public to help a lot of other people who were living . the same lifestyle who didn’t know they had HIV and needed to get . tested ... And she was absolutely right.' His wife, Cookie, who tested negative . along with their son, told the Huffington Post: 'For us, it was super . hard. That was back in the day, in 1991, when people were dying at . alarming rates. That was when people didn’t know anything about the . disease, so it was very frightening.' Awareness: This graph shows the estimated new HIV infections across subpopulations in the U.S. in 2010 . The couple have been leading advocates for HIV awareness, and Johnson recently campaigned in Harlem's Apollo Theater to raise awareness about the high rates of the disease in black and Hispanic communities. Despite representing only 12 per cent . of the population, black Americans account for about 44 per cent of new . HIV infections each year. They are also more likely to die from the . disease. Hispanic Americans are also more . likely to die from HIV than white Americans. According to the Centers . for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanics make up 21 per cent of new . infections each year. Overall, about 1.1 million Americans are living . with HIV, according to federal estimates, with almost one in five . unaware of their infection. Support: Cookie and Magic Johnson in St Tropez earlier this year. Cookie was pregnant with their son when Johnson heard he had HIV . Star: NBA legend Magic Johnson has become a vital part of the Aids awareness campaign . 'In the black community, unfortunately, . we’re still in denial that it can happen to us. We haven’t done a . wonderful job of raising the awareness level or educating our people. Its gotten better since I announced 22 years ago, but it needs to get . much better,' he said.

"By . Mark Nicol . PUBLISHED: . 17:48 EST, 30 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 30 November 2013 . Disguise: Colonel Richard Williams, who commanded the operation, is dressed as a Red Corp . Nine Iraqi police officers who said they were tortured by the SAS have been awarded a total of about £800,000 in compensation. Up to 40 soldiers, including a former SAS commander, are under investigation for alleged brutality. If found guilty of actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm, they may be jailed. The secret payout, which provoked uproar when it emerged last night, was arranged by the Ministry of Defence and the Iraqis’ solicitors. The claimants accused the SAS of strangling them and beating them with rifles at a police station in Majar al-Kabir, in Iraq’s Maysan province, ten years ago. MoD police detectives will fly out in the New Year to question the Iraqi officers about their treatment on June 30, 2003, when they were confronted by 20 SAS soldiers armed with automatic rifles and pistols. The SAS’s top-secret mission – codenamed Operation Jocal – was to hunt down the killers of six Royal Military Policemen. The ‘Red Caps’, as they are known, had been murdered by a mob at the same police station six days previously. At the time, British commanders believed that the Iraqi officers were holding back information vital to the capture of the Red Caps’ murderers. SAS soldiers were sent into the station to persuade them to talk. As part of their plan, the SAS squad, led by Colonel Richard Williams, disguised themselves as Red Caps. This tactic was intended to convince the Iraqi officers they were friends of the murdered men and so secure their co-operation. When the soldiers did not get the answers they needed, they allegedly resorted to violence. Allegations: Above, how the Mail On Sunday reported the 'torture' of Iraqi police by SAS troops . Treatment: Ahmed Al-Maliki was allegedly beaten with a rifle to his back and legs and strangled . Although Colonel Williams commanded the operation, there is no evidence he was personally involved in the alleged brutality. The Red Caps’ killers have never been convicted – a trial collapsed in Baghdad in 2010 after witnesses refused to give evidence. Last year the Iraqis brought legal action against the MoD, claiming compensation for physical and psychological injuries. Their solicitors, Leigh Day, refused to comment last night, insisting they are bound by a confidentiality agreement with the UK Government. Scene: Nine Iraqi police officers have accused the SAS of strangling them and beating them with rifles at a police station in Majar al-Kabir, pictured, in Iraq's Maysan province, ten years ago . A former British commander in Iraq, Colonel Richard Kemp, queried whether the MoD had acted properly. He said: ‘Given the very large number of Iraqis who have exaggerated and made up claims against British Forces, I very much hope that the MoD has made absolutely sure that this payment is justified.’ In the past financial year £10.5 million has been paid to Iraqis who brought allegations of abuse or  illegal detainment by British Forces. Asked about the probe into Majar al-Kabir, a spokesman for the MoD Police said: ‘No arrests have been made, but detectives will be interviewing the complainants in the early part of 2014. ‘The MoD Police investigation is wholly independent of the MoD and civil compensation payments are not a matter for police.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Nine Iraqi police officers have been awarded £800,000 in compensation .

Daniel Beavers, 49, shows off his 'prize', which he says is a tribute to his late father . 'I couldn't believe how big it was': Daniel Beavers' hunt is by far the biggest bear recording in Pennsylvania this season . The 49-year-old said the kill was a tribute to his late father, who taught him to hunt at the age of 12. The Covington Twp. resident just happened to take his father's .30-60 rife with him that day instead of his usual 12-gauge shotgun. 'I don't know why I decided to take his gun,' Beavers told The Times-Tribune. 'I guess I was thinking about him.' Adding to the excitement, Beavers said he has been hunting the same bear for four to five years. He recognized the animal because of an unusual white 'V' on his chest. 'I finally caught up with him,' he said. 'I wasn’t even going to go hunting. 'First drive of the morning he just came right out to me and I shot him.' It only the second bear Beavers has taken .

Moving on: Cristy Deweese tweeted this picture before going 'on-camera,' but it is not clear what the appearance was for . Parents and students have come out in support of a Dallas high school Spanish teacher fired last week for posing naked for Playboy while in college. Cristy Nicole Deweese, 21, was terminated after it was learned she was featured in the magazine three years ago as 'Coed of the Month,' and many students and parents are unhappy with the termination. Ms Deweese, who taught Spanish at Townview Magnet High School has been contacted by male and female students, a petition to reinstate her also garnered over 300 signatures. The saucy Spanish teacher was fired late last week, according to the Dallas Observer, only days after her naughty past was made public. Though she was not a Dallas Independent School District employee at the time the pictures were taken, administrators deemed her past inappropriate for a 21-year-old teaching students only a few years younger. Ms Deweese has not waged a public battle with the school, instead focusing on the students, and they have returned the positivity in spades. A number of former students have tweeted her directly saying they want her back. 'We all miss you so much & want u back bcuz we arent learning & these assignments are hard! U were my fave teacher, no joke,' one student tweeted Ms Deweese. 'I'm sorry :( if I could come back I would,' Ms Deweese replied. 'I miss y'all!' Other students tweeted frowning pictures from classrooms and showed genuine affection for their fired teacher. Ms Deweese even told one student where to find the stickers she gave on tests and home work. Save Ms Deweese: Students organized a petition to bring back their Spanish teacher . Over 300 signatures: Ms Deweese says a student told her he gathered 300 signatures on this petition to reinstate the Spanish teacher . The best ever: A mother emailed the fired teacher to support her, even offering to write a letter of recommendation . Another student sent her a picture of the petition signed by hundreds, and Ms Deweese tweeted a picture of an email from a parent. 'You are the best Spanish teacher she has ever had,' the parent wrote. 'If you need a letter of support you can count on me as a parent and my daughter is willing to support you as well. Hang in there.' A poll in a local report about the firing was overwhelmingly in the former Playboy model's favor - 88 per cent of the over 2,400 people who replied said she should not have been let go. 'I miss the kids, so I'm sad about that, but otherwise I'm doing fine,' she tweeted. After thanking someone for their support, she tweeted 'I'm just hoping they find a new teacher soon so it doesn't affect the students.' The former Playboy Coed of the Month (February 2011) looks to have moved on from being a teacher for the time being, based on a profile started on Model Mayhem. 'I've been modeling since I was 12, quit for a while to pursue teaching and now I'm back,' she wrote on the site. Cristy Nicole Deweese (pictured left) is now a Spanish teacher in Dallas, Texas. When she was 18, she posed as 'Coed of the month' for Playboy . Staying positive: Despite no longer being a teacher, Ms Deweese has remained positive and not hit out against the Dallas ISD - but she may have hired a lawyer . Though saying on Twitter she's unable to discuss her firing for now - perhaps a sign she's retained a lawyer, according to the Observer - she posted a picture on the social media site of herself before going 'on-camera. She then tweeted a picture of herself on TV that she says her mother took. It is not clear if that on-camera  appearance was a modeling audition or for another reason. Ms Deweese also tweeted that she signed a contract saying she can't do any media interviews until November 8. Miss Deweese's sexy shots are available for all to see online - including the teenage boys she currently teaches. Among her pictures are full-frontal naked shots, photos of her wearing 'winter bunny gear' and lingerie, a simulated lesbian sex scene and a 'Naked Outdoors' gallery. In a behind-the-scenes video clip from the photoshoot, when asked about her hobbies, the teenager says: 'Hunting, shooting... I shot me a buck last year.' Model behavior: Miss Deweese relaxes and eats beef jerky in between modeling for Playboy's 'coed of the month' in 2011 . She adds that she is majoring in Spanish and 'going to be a Spanish teacher'. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Dallas Morning News that although her Playboy past should not prevent Miss Deweese from . being a teacher, it did affect the way she is viewed by some students. 'Are her male 16- and 17-year-old students looking at her without picturing her nude?' Another added. 'And for the female students, is this someone they can respect as an educator, someone that they can look up to?' The Dallas school district would not comment on Miss Deweese's pictures, saying that it was a 'personnel matter'. She was not employed by the school district at the time the pictures were taken.","Cristy Nicole Deweese posed naked for the magazine and was 'Coed of the Month' when she was 18 .

But it's not just skincare and make-up that keep Collins young, her youthful approach to fashion helps as well.

Whitney Thompson was the first ever plus-size winner in the history of America’s Next Top Model and has since launched a plus-size dating site, worked with Rihanna and fronted hundreds of campaigns. So, it made perfect sense to call on the 26-year-old to launch new plus-size SLiNK magazine and denim brand Beauty In Curves’ pop-up boutique yesterday. Whitney, who won the modelling show back in 2008, told MailOnline that she’s extremely proud to be representing the new boutique because it goes where no other designers have gone before. New opening: Whitney Thompson launches Beauty In Curves & SLiNK boutique yesterday and is carrying the torch for curvy women after being the first ever plus-size model to win America's Next Top Model in 2008 . ‘Rivkie, who curated the store, travels to New York and searches the markets for good quality pieces that are worth the money, instead of polyester crap that many designers sell,’ she said. Outspoken Whitney believes that the British plus-size market is seriously lacking. ‘In London, there aren’t that many plus-size options or designers. The UK is behind in identifying with the plus-size consumer. I’m not sure that America has embraced it necessarily but they have got the products.’ Sharing her top tips on dressing, Whitney emphasised one key point: ‘Wear clothes that fit you,’ she said. ‘That’s the number one issue. Women try and cover themselves up so they wear clothes that are too big but it makes them look frumpy. I cut the sizes out of everything - you don’t need to know. Headstrong: Whitney recently starred in a . Panache lingerie campaign and says she will never bow to pressure to . lose weight for the sake of fashion . ‘There will never be one perfect size. Kate Upton is a size 8 and some people say she’s too fat and she looks like a cow. ‘We are never going to be a size that is generally accepted by everyone so you have to get over it. Especially with airbrushing, we are trying to look like an image that literally doesn’t exist. 'There will never be one perfect size. Kate Upton is a size 8 and some people say she's too fat and she looks like a cow,' says Whitney . ‘Plus-size starts at a size 6 (UK size 10) in the U.S. but the average woman is a size 10 (UK size 14) so we are telling people that even if you’re half the size of the average woman, you’re too fat. Why? Probably because it sells; it makes women feel bad about themselves and they buy more products. ‘If men were only attracted to women who looked like Victoria Beckham, then we would all look like her. But they’re not and that’s why we are all different shapes and sizes.’ Whitney has taken it upon herself to spread her message to the masses in her role as an ambassador for the National Eating Disorder Association. She travels to Universities all over the States and attends global charity events to support the cause. Speaking about her work, she said: ‘After winning the show I knew I wanted to be involved in philanthropy and as the only plus-size model in the history of the show I knew I needed to do something in touch with that; it felt like a good fit for me. ‘University age is when you’re deciding who you’re going to be for the rest of your life so I love that I’m impacting on people.’ And it seems like her hard work is paying off. She was recently named one of the most influential women in the world, beating off stiff competition from the likes of Hilary Clinton and Michelle Obama. ‘It was a really big deal, I was totally surprised by that and I didn’t realise the impact of what I do,’ she said. One thing Whitney refuses to do is bow to pressure to eat less or exercise more in the name of her figure. ‘I travel all the time, I haven’t . been home in over a year because I am literally on a plane every other . day’ (she recently shot 200 outfits in one day during a shoot in . Istanbul.) ‘When I can and I have the energy, I run because it’s the easiest thing to do but I don’t ever do anything I don’t want to do. ‘I’ll . eat what I want to and I think that’s the problem – people stop . listening to their bodies and start listening to the media. ‘We . have a multi-million pound diet industry that wants us to think we are . fat so they succeed, they get our favourite celebrities on board and the . problem is that no one is listening to themselves. ‘If I want a steak and chips, I am going to eat it and when I feel like going on a run, I will. Contender: Whitney was recently named one of the most influential women in the world by wesbite msn.com, . ‘But I’m never going to force myself to do that. Life is too short; I could walk outside and get hit by a bus so I may as well eat what I want to eat,’ she said. ‘I think what is hard about the plus-size industry is that you’re never the right size. I’ve had people telling me to lose weight as well as gain weight. ‘At the end of the day, you have to look in the mirror and say: “This is it, this is the only body I’ve got.” ‘I’ve definitely been criticised for marching to the beat of my own drum but I take pride in that. You can’t listen to anyone. ‘It hurts. I’ll get called a fat cow or that I am huge. People are harsh. The show is in over one hundred countries so I get hate mail from lots of people but the fan mail is worth so much more than that. ‘I get letters saying “my daughter had bulimia for two years and because of you she has sought treatment”, and just that one fan letter is worth more than all the hate letter in the world. ‘It’s so much more motivational than one saying “you’re fat”.’ Hard worker: Whitney worked with Rihanna on a CoverGirl campaign, as well as working with TOWIE star Gemma Collins, who she says is 'hilarious' and has a great plus-size clothing collection . On top of helping young women beat their demons, Whitney has been working non-stop. Earlier this month she posed in her underwear for a Panache campaign (and she’s already shot another one with the lingerie label) and she is about to pen a column in SLiNK magazine about her life as a plus-size model. She even scored an opportunity to work with superstar Rihanna in a CoverGirl commercial. 'Life is too short; I could walk outside and get hit by a bus so I may as well eat what I want to eat' ‘She was really nice actually, her posse was really kind of rude but she was one of the first celebrities I worked with and she was telling me I was beautiful. Wow,’ she said of the surreal experience. Another fellow celebrity she has huge respect for is TOWIE star Gemma Collins, who she once worked with. ‘Gemma didn’t know who I was but she kept telling me I should be an impersonator for Anna Nicole Smith, she’s hilarious. ‘She has some pretty maxi dresses in her plus-size range. She’s a great spokesperson and has undoubtedly grown up a plus-size girl and didn’t have a lot of options.’ Despite hanging out with superstars, Tennessee-born Whitney does find that the hard work takes its toll. ‘There’s times when I wake up and I don’t know what country I’m in and I did it alone for a long time but now I have a boyfriend and he is travelling with me so that’s really good. ‘We met at high school and randomly got back in touch recently. He is amazing and unbelievably supportive. It’s hard for guys to date someone who does what I do.’ Big break: Whitney walks on the catwalk at a Versace fashion show as part of the final series 10 ANTM show . WhilE she has been occupying her days with Vogue Italia shoots and fashion campaigns, her ultimate dream is to open a bakery. ‘I have a YouTube channel called Curvy Kitchen and I make pumpkin bread, sugar cookies, chocolate covered peanut balls and snicker doodles. ‘My boyfriend was a chef. I would love to open a bakery with him when I settle down and slow down at work,’ she said. But for now, she is happy carrying the torch for her fellow curvy females. ‘The reason I went on top model was because I wanted to live out my motto: “You must be the change you wish to see in the world”. ‘There was no other plus-size model that was really outspoken about the industry and I feel like I have accomplished everything that was on my check-list. ‘If I did stop modelling tomorrow, I would be satisfied with the work I have done.’ SLiNK Boutique and Beauty in Curves have opened a pop-up shop on Blandford Street, London. Both aim to create beautiful and well fitting clothes for curvy women, and the store features jeans and occasion wear. Beauty in Curves are a premium denim brand who use clever tricks (like in-built shapewear and perfectly positioned pockets) to give women the ultimate slimming jeans. SLiNK Boutique describes itself as a 'highly curated, luxury fashion boutique for women size 16+. 'Hot looks for cool curves, SLiNK boutique's buyers hunt down the most on-trend looks and most enviable styles and designers from around the world, bringing them together in their multi-brand online hub.'","Whitney Thompson, 26, won ANTM in 2008 .

Bob Dylan is many things - a singer and songwriter, author, film director, actor and radio host. He’s also, it transpires, a huge heavy metal fan, especially iron gates. What’s more, he actually makes them – and for the first time the gates, welded out of vintage iron and other metal parts, will go on public display. They will appear at the Halcyon Gallery in London at an exhibition called Mood Swings, alongside original works on canvas and signed limited editions, all of which will be for sale. Weld I never: Bob Dylan at his iron works studio . Dylan wrote in his auto-biography, Chronicles, that he had ‘arc-welding equipment’ at his Malibu home and enjoyed making ‘ornate iron gates out of junk scrap metal’. However, Dylan is known for being elusive and not always forthcoming with concrete facts about his personal life, so many people took this with a pinch of salt. However, it turns out that Dylan has a lifelong fascination with welding and metalwork and the gate-making remark was entirely true. Better gate than never: Dylan has revealed that he's held a life-long fascination with welding and metal work . Wroughts and all exhibition: Dylan's handiwork will be on display from November 16 at the Halcyon Gallery iin London . He said: ‘I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country - where you could breathe it and smell it every day. And I've always worked with it in one form or another. ‘Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference.’ Paul Green, President of the Halcyon Gallery, commented: ‘The forthcoming exhibition will be the most comprehensive and authoritative collection of Bob Dylan’s art to date. While Dylan has been a committed visual artist for more than four decades, this exhibition will cast new light on one of the world’s most important and influential cultural figures of our time. Hot stuff: All of Dylan's works will be for sale at the London exhibition . Airy: Dylan says he likes gates because they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow . ‘His iron works demonstrate his boundless creativity and talent. As these artworks are made at home, not on the road, they give us a rare glimpse into another part of the artist's own personal universe.’ Bob Dylan has sold over 110 million records around the world and continues to tour extensively, logging up more than 2,500 shows since 1988. The free exhibition, Bob Dylan Mood Swings, opens at the Halcyon Gallery, 144-146 New Bond Street, on 16 November 2013 and runs until 25 January 2014. Visit www.halcyongallery.com for more details.

For months, Jodi Arias was a television staple and practically every minute of her murder trial was broadcast live. But Arias has vanished from view since her trial ended in May, and the judge has done a complete about-face. She has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far. New venture: Convicted killer Jodi Arias has launched a book club from behind bars and is sharing her reviews . Attorney David Bodney represents . several media outlets fighting for transparency in the case. He says . there have been repeated violations of the public's constitutional right . to attend proceedings in the case. Arias, 33, admitted she killed her . boyfriend in 2008 at his suburban Phoenix home but claimed it was . self-defense. Travis Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds, had his . throat slit and was shot in the forehead in what prosecutors argued was a . jealous rage. Although she was convicted of murder in May, but the jury couldn't reach a verdict on her sentence. Prosecutors are now pursuing a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to get the death penalty. No date for a new trial has been set. Killed: Arias murdered her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, pictured, who was found stabbed and shot in 2008 . Judge Sherry Stephens has held hearing . after hearing behind closed doors as the next steps of the case unfold . almost entirely under a shroud of secrecy. Over the last several months, . she has heard arguments over sequestering the new jury, moving the case . out of Phoenix, Arias' desire to fire her lead attorney and allowing . live television coverage of the retrial, among other issues. She . has denied each request, but quietly with orders released days after . the secret hearings as the case languishes without public scrutiny even . as Arias' legal tab is being picked up by taxpayers at a cost exceeding . $1.7 million. Meanwhile, in yet another element of secrecy, Maricopa . County Attorney Bill Montgomery has refused to provide a tally of how . much it has cost to prosecute the case, including paying for expert . witnesses throughout the five-month trial. Stephens . allowed virtually unfettered access to the first trial, which was . broadcast live and became to fans like a real-life soap opera as they . traveled from around the country to get in the courtroom. She . now says the hearing closures are intended to protect Arias' right to . an impartial jury, but Bondey says the judge has gone to the extreme, . often simply locking the courtroom doors without issuing an order as to . why, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Out of the spotlight: Unlike the original trial in May, the new sentencing trial of Jodi Arias won't be broadcast on national television . 'The . public is deprived of its First Amendment right to attend criminal . proceedings,' Bodney said. 'The public has a right to be heard before . they're just locked out.' The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution . guarantees such basic rights as freedom of speech and the press. Even arguments by attorneys over media access to proceedings in the case have been closed to the media. An . irony not lost on Bodney is that the intense media interest in the case . has largely evolved from Arias' own actions by courting interviews and . operating a Twitter account and selling her artwork from behind bars . through a third party. She regularly posts inspirational quotes, links . to purchase her drawings and solicitations for donations for her . appeals. A clerk for . Stephens said the judge could not comment on an ongoing case. Defense . lawyer Kirk Nurmi has not returned telephone messages. While all the requests to close hearings have come from defense attorneys, prosecutors haven't objected. Life or death? Arias is still awaiting a second trial after jurors couldn¿t come to a decision on whether or not she should receive the death penalty for the 2008 murder of her boyfriend . 'It's . a balance, but I believe when push comes to shove, a defendant's right . to a fair trial is probably going to trump what otherwise is considered . the public's right to attend trial,' Montgomery said. Phoenix . defense lawyer Mel McDonald, a former Maricopa County judge and federal . prosecutor, said the judge likely never expected the Arias case would . attract such publicity and is now trying to dial back access to protect . the record for inevitable appeals. 'The . more that comes out, the harder it's going to be to find an impartial . jury and the greater the risk of prejudice and error,' McDonald said. Bodney doesn't buy it. He . said the judge's decision to ban live television coverage and the use . of all electronic devices, meaning reporters won't be able to provide . real-time updates via Twitter as occurred during the first trial, is a 'severe overcorrection' that will 'deprive the public a lens into the . concluding chapter of this trial.'","Jodi Arias was convicted in May of murdering her boyfriend .

Hydro-fracking pro: Michael Economides advocated on behalf of the controversial drilling method known as hydro-fracking . A world-renowned energy expert - and a key proponent of controversial drilling method hydro-fracking - died Saturday of a heart attack during an international flight. Michael Economides, 64, suffered a heart attack over the Atlantic Ocean while flying from Spain to Chile. He was a prolific author and public speaker, as well as a professor at the University of Houston’s Cullen College of Engineering. The demand for Mr Economides knowledge forced him to become an adjunct professor teaching only one class per semester as he traveled the globe advising companies and audiences. Wife Christine Economides, 62, told the Houston Chronicle that demand for her husband was soaring around the world, and that the energy expert loved to travel. ‘He wouldn't have been happy if he was not constantly traveling,’ she told the paper. ‘He didn't just travel. He wrote books and collaborated globally.’ Mr Economides was also a leading proponent of hydraulic fracturing, also known as hydro-fracking. ‘He . got into the whole space of horizontal drilling,’ Ramanan Krishnamoorti, the chief energy officer at UH said in a statement. ‘How do you effectively stimulate horizontal drilling? He was a . strong proponent of hydraulic fracturing.’ ‘He put a lot of science behind it,’ the UH colleague added. ‘He would go into the field, and things would start to happen.’ Hydro-fracking involves using a pressurized mixture of chemicals called heavy mud to force natural gas to the surface from underneath the ground. It has been said to poison nearby water supplies and lead to numerous medical conditions. In high demand: Mr Economides regularly appeared on television and advised several companies around the world . ‘He is a globally recognized expert in . hydraulic fracturing, in production techniques, generally,’ Tom Holley, . director of the petroleum engineering program at UH, said in a . statement. Mr Ecomonides advised energy giants China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Italy’s ENI, as well as firms in Russia and Venezuela, the paper noted. He also wrote or co-authored 15 books, including the best-selling ‘The Color of Oil,’ and often appeared on television networks CNBC, CNN and Fox Business, among other media outlets.

According to Maine State Police Milliner, who recently moved to Maine from Colorado, had just purchased the weapon the night before. Police have described the two men as former lovers whose relationship had recently ended. Although authorities haven't pinpointed when the pair split up, the period after a breakup is considered the most dangerous, especially if one partner has access to or recently purchased a gun, Julia Colpitts, executive director of the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence, told Portland Press Herald. The Mayor of Westbrook, Colleen Hilton, described the incident as ‘a senseless tragedy’ and said she had personally known the Rairdon family for many years. Authorities haven't pinpointed when Rairdon, right, and Milliner, left, had volunteered together on the Equality Maine campaign in 2012 to secure same-sex rights in the state .

According to Milliner’s Facebook page, the pair had volunteered together on the Equality Maine campaign, which in 2012 helped to secure same-sex marriage rights in the state. On September 2 Milliner had written: ‘One of my favorite memories in Maine so far was watching family videos with his family today.

Team work: Part of what makes the record so challenging to beat is that the women have to perform in tandem . Vertical skydiving is regarded as more difficult than freefall, belly-to-earth skydiving. Skydivers hurtle toward the earth at higher speeds - some times as fast as 170mph - in a position that makes control more of a challenge. 'When you are on your head, everything happens a lot faster. You have a lot less surface area exposed to the air ... so it's a harder position to fly and control,' Koreen said. Nearly 100 women turned out to compete for the chance to be a part of the dive Thursday. Challenge: Vertical skydiving is considered more difficult than regular skydiving because the body propels faster to the ground with less resistance .

Davis' husband was away on business in North Carolina when the log-cabin style home was all but flattened, relatives said. According to Alford, neighbors reported a bang and started searching the area when they discovered Davis' house had been destroyed. Photographs provided by the sheriff's department and the victim's family show that little is left of the home except bits of insulation and a crumbling foundation. The devastation resembles the aftermath of a tornado. Investigators believe the explosion was likely caused by a propane leak ignited by water heaters in the basement of Davis' home, Alford said. Foul play is not suspected. It was first reported that no one was injured in the blast, but shortly after noon Sunday Davis' body was found inside what was left of the home. Davis' husband Gary Wagoner was en . route to Texas Sunday. He was on a business trip in North Carolina when . the tragedy unfolded, Alford said. Scroll down for video . Debris: The devastation, pictured, was similar to the aftermath of a tornado . Before: The home was a three-story log-cabin style house, pictrued . Dispatchers received calls from miles away in neighboring cities including Keene, Cleburne and Rio Vista reporting an explosion. Grandview is about 30 miles south of Fort Worth. On Sunday, Davis' family mourned the loss of the loving mother and grandmother on Facebook. Her daughter, Brandee Simons, posted a photo of what was left of her mother's home, with emergency vehicles out the front. 'We lost mom as of last night,' she wrote Sunday.

Florida's Native Americans have said they will battle to preserve the lands where their ancestors were once imprisoned. The Seminole Wars, also known as the Florida Wars, were three conflicts between Native Americans who had settled in Florida but were forced to move in the early 18th century by the U.S. Army. Hundreds of Seminole Tribe members were imprisoned at Egmont Key near the mouth of Tampa Bay by federal officials in the 1850s during the Third Seminole War. Those Seminoles who did not perish on the island in the harsh conditions were taken by ship to Florida's Panhandle where they were made to continue the journey by land and find new reservations in the west - a journey current-day Seminoles call the 'Voyage of Tears.' Edna Bowers (right), descendent of Polly Parker, looks on as fellow tribe member Willie Johns (left) and Florida Park Services Director Donald Forgione hang a photograph of Parker . Historic: Seminole Tribe member and historian Willie Johns holds up a photograph of Polly Parker . Florida Park Services Director Donald Forgione (at podium) addresses Seminole Tribe members and guests during a visit to Egmont Key State Park . 'This is kind of like our holocaust,' said Willie Johns, Seminole Tribe member and historian. Johns is a descendent on his father's side of Polly Parker, who was imprisoned. On Sunday, direct descendants visited the island and praised Parker's legendary 1858 escape. Parker persuaded federal officials to allow her to look for herbs. Instead, she fled, with about a dozen other Seminole members which led to an extensive search by U.S. forces. Seminole Tribe member Bobby Henry visits Egmont Key State Park to retrace the 'Voyage of Tears' She eventually returned to her family's camp hundreds of miles south near Lake Okeechobee. Peter Gallagher, a spokesman for the Seminole Tribe, said: 'Her progeny became many of the leaders and important figures of the tribe ever since. After leaving Egmont Key, the group planned to continue their journey aboard the Florida Fisherman II northward to St Marks - a 22-hour trip - and then press on for Tallahassee by bus.

Dead palm trees litter the eroded shoreline of Egmont Key State Park where Seminole tribe members began a historic journey to retrace the 'Voyage of Tears' Seminole Tribe members boarded a charter boat which departed from Egmont Key State Park as part of a historic journey to retrace the 'Voyage of Tears' Their purpose was to retrace part of the journey of their ancestors and to talk with leaders in the state capital about the preservation of Egmont Key. The island, which is a national wildlife sanctuary, is less than half the size it was about 100 years ago due to land erosion. Seminole Tribe member Edna Bowers, descendent of Polly Parker, visits Egmont Key State Park . While its white beaches, emerald-colored waters, and inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places due to the lighthouse and the old Fort Dade make it a popular tourist spot for snorkelers and visitors, members of the Seminole Tribe see the erosion as a threat to their history. They fear that their ancestors' buried remains might one day be washed away and under water like the mostly submerged remnants of Fort Dade. Mr Johns said: 'From this day on we can help each other in all we do to preserve this place. Edna Bowers, of Hollywood, Florida, took part in the trip. A direct descendent of Parker, she grew up hearing about the hard times that her ancestors endured and all that they overcame. In the brief stop on Egmont Key, Bowers looked through the historic photographs brought by Woody Hanson of Fort Myers, who says his grandfather - W. Stanley Hanson - was an advocate for the Seminole Tribe and was with Parker when she died. 'It means a lot,' Bowers said about drawing attention to Parker's story. 'I wondered,' Bowers said, 'When she was ever going to be recognised for what she went through.' Rounded up: This 1816 picture depicts the capture of the Seminole Indian Chiefs.

The price of lords-a-leaping and ladies dancing has spiked this holiday season, but other items mentioned in the carol 'The 12 Days of Christmas' still cost the same as they did last year. Buying one set of the gifts mentioned in each verse costs $27,393 in stores, or 7.7 per cent more than last year, according to the so-called Christmas Price Index that PNC Wealth Management updates annually. And if you buy all 364 items repeated throughout the carol, you'll pay $114,651 — 6.9 per cent more than last year. Last-minute shoppers who turn to the Internet will pay even more for all the gifts — about $173,000. The cost of a carol: Buying one set of the items mentioned in the 12 Days of Christmas cost $27,393 in 2013 . 'We were surprised to see such a large increase from a year ago, given the overall benign inflation rate in the U.S.,' said Jim Dunigan, managing executive of investments for PNC. The federal government's core Consumer Price Index rose only 1.7 per cent this year. In the three decades since the list was started in 1984, year-over-year increases have averaged 2.9 per cent, which is exactly the same number as broader U.S. inflation. But it's a fickle list because the price of some items has barely budged, while others have soared. Can you put seven swans-a-swimming on layaway? Swans are the most expensive item on the list this year, coming in at $1,000 dollars each . Seven swans cost $7,000 this year, the same as in 1984, while the cost of a single partridge went from $12.57 to $15 during the same period. Savings: One of the more affordable items on the list are the eight maids-a-milking at $58 since the federal minimum wage hasn't risen . One pear tree to put that partridge in? Thirty years ago it cost $19.95, but will now set you back $184. The cost of nine ladies dancing is now $7,553, or 20 per cent more than last year's $6,294, while 10 lords-a-leaping jumped 10 percent, to $5,243. Seven items on the list cost the same as they did last year, including gold rings and turtle doves, while pipers piping, drummers drumming, and the pear tree showed only modest changes up or down. The swans are the most expensive item at $1,000 each. The eight maids-a-milking still cost a total of just $58 because the federal minimum wage hasn't risen. At $7.25 each, they're the least expensive gifts in the song. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. checks jewelry stores, dance companies, pet stores and other sources to compile the list. Among its sources this year were the National Aviary in Pittsburgh and the Philadelphia-based Pennsylvania Ballet Company.","PNC Wealth Management calculates the cost of the 12 Days of Christmas items every year .

Postal workers are refusing to deliver mail to a woman’s home because they are scared of slipping on pigeon poo. Heather Rogers, 63, has not received regular mail deliveries since October because pigeon droppings have made it too slippery for postal staff to deliver to her home. Pigeons gather on top of a wall above the small alley called Wheelbarrow Lane in Helston, Cornwall, and regularly splatter the path with droppings. Isobel Crarer, 18, pictured left under an umbrella to shield herself from pigeon poo on Wheelbarrow Lane in Helston, Cornwall, where residents have complained that post is not being delivered because bird mess  is making the path a health and safety risk because it is too slippery . Messy issue: Pigeons gather on top of a wall above the small alley causing a large amount of bird mess . The frustrated resident has been told by Royal Mail that the amount of bird waste in an alleyway leading to her house in Cornwall is a health and safety risk. But Royal Mail said that the service was resumed three week after it was suspended, which was due to broken glass and a 'slimy' walkway. Mrs Rogers noticed the issue when BT rang her in October to demand payment for a phone bill she never received. She went to the post office to pick it up where it had been marked 'too slippery'. Officials at Royal Mail have told her that it is up to each postal worker to decide if they want to walk on the pigeon droppings. Mrs Rogers said: 'I went to the post office and they said they hadn’t been going down there because it was too slippery with all the pigeons. Mystery: It is not known why many birds choose to gather in the same alleyway in the Cornish town . Endless cycle: Cornwall Council environmental health officers have visited the alleyway to clean up the mess but the birds soon returned to leave more droppings . 'A few of the letters had ""too slippery"" written on the envelopes. Some come through the door but the rest pile up at the post office.' She was then asked by her bank if her circumstances had changed because her undelivered bank statement was returned. Mrs Rogers says she has called in environmental health officers from Cornwall Council to clean up the droppings - but the bothersome birds simply return. A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'We suspended delivery to two addresses in Wheelbarrow Lane, Helston, in October 2012, because the postman delivering there reported broken glass and a slippery, slimy surface  on the path in the narrow alleyway. 'We informed the customers of the suspension and told them we would be contacting the local authority to request cleaning work be carried out in the alleyway. 'We advised the customers that we would hold their mail for collection in the local delivery office, about 500 yards away from their properties, at Helston Delivery Office, until the pathway was made safe. 'This was completed about three weeks later by the council and deliveries were resumed at this time. 'The safety and welfare of our staff is paramount and we only suspend deliveries if the safety of our postmen and women is at risk. 'Royal Mail delivers to almost 29 million addresses across the UK and our postmen and women go out in all weather conditions including wind, rain, snow and ice, so it is always a last resort if we decide not to deliver to a specific address or addresses.'

It was named one of the top 10 parties in the world by Forbes and boasts a glittering list of past participants, among them Ksénia Gorbachev, Barbara Berlusconi and the Ecclestone sisters. But this year's glamorous Bal des Débutantes in Paris will witness a deb of more humble origins take centre stage. Lauren Marbe, 17, is the daughter of an Essex taxi driver and was invited to take part after organisers were impressed by her incredibly high score in a Mensa test. Ball: Clever teenager Lauren Marbe, 17, has been invited to the Ball des Debutantes in Paris next month . Impressed: Lauren was invited to the ball after organisers were impressed by reports of her intelligence . The Essex teenager has an IQ of 161, making her cleverer than Einstein and Bill Gates, and putting her miles ahead of the average of 100. She still is a long way off the Guinness Book Of Records holder of the highest IQ - held by American magazine columnist and playwright Marylin vos Savant, who has a score of 228. But then, at 67 years of age, Mrs vos Savant was never in a position to take Lauren's place at this year's deb ball. Now the teen, who admits to a penchant for fake tan and TOWIE, will join Lady Amelia Windsor, the granddaughter of the Duke of Kent, and John F. Kennedy's great-niece Kyra at the ball, which will take place at the end of November. 'We tell a story about each young lady and this girl certainly has a story to tell,' organiser Ophelie Renouard told the Telegraph. 'I read an article about her, found her interesting and asked her to come and she said yes. She is very excited.' The Bal des Débutantes has been a Paris institution since 1992 and brings together girls from some of the world's most glittering society families. Glitttering: Former participants include Theodora Warre, Sofia Barclay and Princess Augusta von Preussen . Wealthy: Former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev's granddaughter, Anastasia, has also taken part . Although it usually takes place at the magnificent Hotel du Crillon, this year's event will take place at the equally spectacular Automobile Club de France on the Place de la Concorde. Debutantes are limited to just 25 per . year and each is accompanied by a 'chevalier' [knight], on whose arm . they will make their debut. In . Lauren's case, her chevalier will be a 20-year-old Frenchman named . Théodore Rousseau, who, says the teen, 'doesn't know what an Essex girl . is'. Despite her chevalier's patchy knowledge of English women, Lauren, although concerned about her lack of French language skills, says she has 'never been so excited about something' while her mother Susan revealed that her daughter was 'amazed' when the call from Ophelie came. 'When the call came from Ophelie, Lauren had a look and was amazed,' the proud parent revealed. With a glamorous night in the company of Théodore and the 24 other debs to look forward to, it seems there's plenty of excitement yet to come for Britain's brainiest teen.

Lord Justice Leveson suggests what opponents immediately described as 'chilling' changes to protections given to journalists who are handling 'private' information . Investigative journalists who breach data protection rules could be jailed for two years under proposals in the Leveson report. The judge also suggests what opponents immediately described as ‘chilling’ changes to protections given to journalists who are handling ‘private’ information. Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg raised serious concerns about the proposed changes to the Data Protection Act, which currently gives a wide exemption to public-interest journalism. In the Commons yesterday Mr Cameron said he was ‘instinctively concerned’ about the plans. Liberal Democrat sources went further, warning that the proposals could have a ‘chilling effect’ on investigative journalism operating in the public interest. They said the measures raised eyebrows because they were completely unexpected and had had not been discussed in detail during the inquiry. Currently, journalists are allowed to hold personal information about criminals, corrupt politicians and rogue traders whom they are investigating without falling foul of privacy law. Unlike the government agencies and private companies, journalists do not have to comply with strict rules about how private information must be handled. But Lord Justice Leveson proposes removing a number of key legal protections offered to journalists under the Data Protection Act. He also suggests that punishments for breaches of the Act should be increased from an unlimited fine now to a jail term of up to two years. Leveson proposes changing the law so that personal data can be held only if it is absolutely necessary for a specific article which is set for publication. It would undermine investigations which take a long time and involve gathering information which might ultimately never be used. Personal data used by journalists can include bank account statements showing illegal payments made to crooked officials or credit card receipts proving abuse of taxpayers’ money. In the Commons yesterday Mr Cameron, pictured, said he was 'instinctively concerned' about the plans . Responding to the report in the Commons yesterday, Mr Cameron said it proposed ‘some changes to the Data Protection Act that would reduce the special treatment that journalists are afforded when dealing with personal data’. ‘We must consider this very carefully – particularly the impact this could have on investigative journalism. ‘While I have only been able to make preliminary investigations about this since reading the report, I am instinctively concerned about this proposal.’ The report proposes making it harder for journalists to gather personal information without falling foul of the law. Journalists who are publishing personal information would no longer be able to justify it on the grounds that they have a right to freedom of expression. In addition, they would no longer be exempt from particular parts of the Act, such as subject access requests. This change might allow anyone who is the subject of an investigation to demand to see what information a newspaper holds about him or her. Lord Justice Leveson ruled that worldwide circulation of pictures showing Prince Harry, pictured, naked did not justify their publication in British newspapers. Just nine pages of Lord Justice Leveson’s 2,400-page report focused on news on the internet. In it, he ruled that worldwide circulation of pictures showing Prince Harry naked did not justify their publication in British newspapers. Photographs showing the prince after a game of ‘strip billiards’ in Las Vegas were viewed by millions on the internet after they appeared on a US gossip website and social media sites including Facebook. But Lord Justice Leveson said that was no justification for them appearing in a British newspaper. Parents could stop their children from accessing the pictures on the internet but would find it difficult to stop them seeing the images in newspapers, he said. His comments appeared to contradict repeated warnings from internet safety campaigners that children access the internet on smartphones and laptops regularly without their parents’ knowledge. Lord Justice Leveson said: ‘To some extent, parents can control what their children can access on the internet: if they take their child into a newsagent, garage or supermarket – or past a news stall – the control that they must be entitled to exercise is lost.’ In Britain, the Sun was the only newspaper to publish the Harry pictures after Prince Charles instructed lawyers to threaten legal action for infringing his son’s ‘privacy’. The Sun claimed the prince had ‘compromised his own privacy’ and it was ‘perverse’ for newspapers not to publish the shots when they were freely available on the internet. Lord Justice Leveson said there was a legitimate public interest in raising questions over Harry’s conduct, and the remit of his protection officers who seemingly allowed the prince to invite strangers to his hotel room for the naked romp. But he said that debate did not require the publication of the photographs. ‘The fact that something is on the internet does not justify its publication in a newspaper.’ No formal complaint was made by the Palace. A month later, a French magazine published photographs of Kate Middleton sunbathing topless and they were subsequently circulated on websites.","Leveson suggests what opponents immediately described as 'chilling' changes to protections given to journalists handling 'private' information .

Lord Leveson wants Ofcom to 'verify' a new independent regulator and act as a 'backstop' for those newspapers which did not sign up . One of New Labour’s most powerful quangos would have ultimate responsibility for press regulation under dramatic plans set out in Lord Leveson’s report. The judge insisted his proposals would not amount to state regulation of newspapers, but legislation was needed to enforce it. But both David Cameron and Nick Clegg today criticised the plan to change the law to put state media watchdog Ofcom in overall charge of ‘verifying’ a new independent regulatory body. The report recommended the new body would be able to impose £1million fines on newspapers and demand front page apologies. The Prime Minister said he agreed with much of what Lord Leveson suggested, but refused to back legislation to enforce it. Lord Leveson said his proposed new body  - to replace the existing Press Complaints Commission - would promote high standards of journalism and protect the rights of individuals. As part of the judge's plans, the chairman and the board of the new body must include a majority of members who are independent from the industry. Serving editors, MPs and ministers would be banned from being on the board. A separate independent panel - which could include a serving editor - would make appointments to the board and its chairman. The panel in turn would be overseen by Ofcom, which would review the independence of the process every two years. But Ofcom is a government quango, and its chief executive is appointed by ministers, raising serious doubts about the process's independence from government. While David Cameron and Nick Clegg disagree on much of the Leveson report, both are opposed to the idea of Ofcom overseeing the system of regulation . Legislation passed in Parliament would be . needed for the new body to be recognised in legal processes and to allow . Ofcom to oversee its independence and effectiveness. These are the main proposals for the press set out in the Leveson report: . Ofcom would also be a ‘backstop’ regulator for newspapers who did not sign up to the new scheme. Under Lord Leveson's plans, an . arbitration process would be put in place for newspapers to resolve . complaints from members of the public. Organisations . that signed up would have legal costs limited if the dispute went to . court, but this would require a change in the law. Lord Leveson also wants legislation to ‘enshrine, for the first time, a legal duty on the Government to protect the freedom of the press’ But the idea of state body Ofcom being involved in press regulation has proven one of the most contentious parts of the plan. Mr Cameron warned: 'Ofcom is already a very powerful regulatory body and we should be trying to reduce concentrations of power rather than increase them.' Ofcom was set up by Tony Blair in . 2003. Six years later, David Cameron warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will . cease to exist' if he became PM as part of a crackdown on quangos. The chief executive of Ofcom is currently Ed Richards, appointed in 2006, who was previously a media advisor to Mr Blair. Mr . Richards, was tipped as Director General of the BBC, can continue in . the post for as long as he likes because the job does not have a fixed . term. Lord Justice Leveson insisted ‘this is not, and cannot be characterised as, statutory regulation of the press’. ‘What . is proposed here is independent regulation of the press organised by . the press, with a statutory verification process to ensure that the . required levels of independence and effectiveness are met by the system . in order for publishers to take advantage of the benefits arising as a . result of membership,’ he added. Government quango Ofcom was created by Tony Blair, and its current chief executive Ed Richards is a former New Labour policy advisor. Critics say because the Ofcom boss is appointed by ministers it cannot oversee press regulation . While Mr Clegg has backed much of the Leveson plan, he also warned against involving Ofcom. ‘Ofcom has a key role in regulating the content of broadcast media and I'm yet to be convinced that it is best placed to take on this new, light touch function with the print media too,’ the Deputy Prime Minister said. Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Media Select Committee, warned Ofcom would wield too much power. He said: ‘We just can’t simply farm out these important decisions with a blank cheque to somebody who is wholly unelected and unaccountable. ‘Having the Government say to the press, “These are the specific steps we need you to take, otherwise we will either legislate or regulate” is a pretty rum form of self-regulation.’","Lord Leveson wants to give state watchdog oversight of new independent regulator .

The culling of badgers received another setback yesterday when it emerged that only 40 per cent of the target figure had been achieved in the latest trial scheme. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson announced that the cull – to reduce tuberculosis in cattle – missed its quota in Gloucestershire, even after it was cut from 70 per cent to 58 per cent and marksmen were given an extra five weeks. Labour environment spokesman Maria Eagle said Mr Paterson – who blamed earlier problems on ‘badgers moving the goalposts’ – had been humiliated. Only 40 per cent of the target figure were culled in the pilot scheme which has been hailed as a success by Owen Paterson . The shadow environment secretary said: 'Despite revising downwards the estimated number of badgers and . extending the trials contrary to clear scientific advice, Owen Paterson . has still failed to reduce the badger population by his own stated goal . of 70 per cent. 'The decision to revoke this badger cull licence is a . humiliation for Owen Paterson and must spell the end for his misguided . and unscientific policy.' Mr Paterson revealed that just 213 badgers were killed in the final five weeks of the cull, bringing the total to 921. Presenting . the figures in a written statement to Parliament, he said: 'This . represents a reduction of just under 40 per cent in the estimated badger . population before culling began.' Despite failing to cull a sufficient number of badgers, Mr Paterson hailed the pilot as a success. The setback was described as a 'humiliating' blow to Owen Paterson . 'The extension in Gloucestershire has therefore been successful in . meeting its aim in preparing the ground for a fully effective four-year . cull. 'I would like to pay tribute to the local farmers and . landowners who have undertaken the pilots in both areas, often in . difficult terrain and weather, and often in the face of intimidation by a . small minority. 'Culling is only one part of our approach to tackle . the spread of TB. We are using every tool available including tougher . movement controls for cattle, better biosecurity on farms and working to . develop effective and usable cattle and badger vaccines.' Natural England announced last week . that shooting was being halted in Gloucestershire three weeks before . schedule, as it became clear that the revised cull target would not be . met. But Mr Paterson hailed the scheme as a success and said the cull was only part of the battle against TB backed by farmers and vets. An Independent Panel of Experts will consider the information collected during the pilots. Their report is due to be published early in 2014 and then the Government will have to decide whether to repeat the cull in other parts of England. Mr Paterson added: 'While there are important lessons to learn, completing two pilots this year has been a significant achievement and is another major step towards halting the spread of bovine TB.' An extension to a separate pilot cull in Somerset also failed to meet its target. The Somerset trial killed 65 per cent of badgers, still short of the 70 per cent. The shortfalls come despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards. Maria Eagle described the pilot as a 'misguided and unspecified policy' while NFU president Peter Kendall said his union was backing the scheme . Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said the end of the cull was a 'humiliating and inevitable setback' for Mr Paterson. 'This ill-advised cut-rate shambles has involved miscalculation of badger populations, manipulated time scales, huge expense for the taxpayer in policing costs, and the fiasco of repeatedly missed targets,' he said. 'If it was not so serious it would be comical and should never have happened in the first place.' The National Farmers Union has continued to support the rolling out of further culls in other parts of the country. The union's president Peter Kendall said: 'The NFU remains committed to supporting wider roll-out to help prevent the spread of this terrible disease.' Government figures show more than 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in England in 2012 because of bovine TB.","Only 931 badgers have been culled in total .

Police conducted themselves with ‘integrity’ at all times during the original phone hacking investigation, Lord Justice Leveson ruled. In the months of fevered speculation leading up to the inquiry being called, officers had been accused of turning a blind eye to the industrial scale of the phone-hacking carried out by News of the World journalists. The Metropolitan force was accused in the Guardian and elsewhere of not investigating properly because of its closeness to News International, owner of the now defunct NotW. Lord Justice Leveson said a ‘series of poor decisions, poorly executed’ had contributed to this idea taking hold. But, crucially, he said there was no reason to doubt the integrity of the police and senior officers concerned. He accepted the force’s argument that it had been under huge pressure to devote resources to thwarting terrorist attacks at the time the original decision was taken in 2006. London had been attacked by terrorists in July 2005 and a transatlantic bomb plot was being investigated in one of the biggest operations in modern times. Police launched the original hacking investigation, dubbed Operation Caryatid, after members of the Royal Household contacted them with concerns that their voicemails were hacked by the NoW in December 2005. The newspaper’s former royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed in 2007 for hacking.

But the judge added: ‘In reality, I . am satisfied that I have seen no basis for challenging at any stage the . integrity of the police, or that of the senior police officers . concerned. ‘What is, . however, equally clear is that a series of poor decisions, poorly . executed, all came together to contribute to the perception that I have . recognised.’ The report acknowledged that the . decision to restrict the original investigation was justified, given the . pressures of counter-terrorism activities at the time.

A defensive mindset was then established which affected all that followed.’ But the report concluded: ‘The mistakes were neither more nor less than that: the integrity of the officers who gave evidence and were directly involved in the investigation shone through what they said and I do not doubt it.’ London had been attacked by terrorists in July 2005 (above) and a transatlantic bomb plot was being investigated in one of the biggest operations in modern times - putting the police under huge pressure .

The News of the World did not give ‘false hope’ to Milly Dowler’s parents by deleting messages on her mobile phone, Lord Justice Leveson accepts in his report. The toxic claim – made by the Guardian newspaper – was the direct trigger for the Prime Minister establishing the inquiry in July last year. But the report accepts that this did not happen and that the voicemail messages were probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator. During their evidence, Bob and Sally Dowler spoke movingly of the moment in March 2002 when they realised that messages on their missing daughter’s phone had been deleted. This became known as the ‘false hope moment’ because it led them to believe that Milly was alive. Several months after making its claim, the Guardian accepted that journalists from the News of the World – by now defunct – had not deleted the messages. Lord Justice Leveson says in his report: ‘I entirely reject the suggestions that this error has undermined the basis for the inquiry which, in the light of all the evidence I have heard, was and remains more than amply justified. ‘Whereas it is true that a definitive conclusion is not possible on the existing state of the evidence, and may never be, the inquiry does conclude on the lower standard of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of Milly Dowler’s voicemail was not the cause of the “false hope moment”. ‘This resulted from nothing less banal than the automatic deletion of messages in the ordinary course of the workings of the system.’ The News of the World did not give 'false hope' to Milly Dowler's parents (pictured yesterday) by deleting messages on her mobile phone, Lord Justice Leveson accepts in his report .","Officers had been accused of turning blind eye to phone hacking carried out by News of the World journalists .

Wrong: The behaviour of the press during the search for Milly Dowler and their treatment of her parents was 'outrageous' Having spent 16 months taking 'the most concentrated look at the press this country has ever seen', Lord Leveson has attacked the 'reckless' abuses of British newspapers. People who found themselves in the public eye for reasons 'beyond their control' were treated as 'commodities', left with no rights to privacy, dignity or basic respect, he said. The parents of Madeleine McCann and Milly Dowler were used as examples of people who had been abused most. The News of the World received the fiercest criticism as the now-defunct tabloid had a general 'loss of direction' and 'lack of respect'. 'At the News of the World, quite apart from phone hacking, there was a failure of systems of management and compliance,' he wrote. 'None of the witnesses were able to identify who was responsible for ensuring compliance with an ethical approach to journalism and there was a general lack of respect for individual privacy and dignity. 'It was said that the News of the World had ""lost its way"" in relation to phone hacking; its casual attitude to privacy and the lip service it paid to consent demonstrated a far more general loss of direction.' The judge also declared the Press Complaints Commission had 'failed' at keeping newspapers in line and protecting the public. 'There have been too many times when, chasing the story, parts of the press have acted as if its own code, which it wrote, simply did not exist. This has caused real hardship and, on occasion, wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people whose rights and liberties have been disdained,' he said. 'This is not just the famous, but ordinary members of the public, caught up in events (many of them truly tragic) far larger than they could cope with but made much, much worse by press behaviour that, at times, can only be described as outrageous. Slammed: The News of the World 'lost its way', Lord Leveson said, which led to its demise after 168 years (editor Colin Myler holds the final edition) 'Almost everyone accepts that the Press Complaints Commission has failed in the task, if indeed it ever saw itself as having such a task, of keeping the press to its responsibilities to the public generally, and to the individuals unfairly damaged. There must be change'. Bob and Sally Dowler gave moving evidence to the inquiry about their treatment at the hands of the press following the disappearance of their daughter. Disclosures that Milly’s phone was hacked by journalists and voicemails deleted - giving her parents 'false hope' that she was still alive - was the scandal that prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to launch the Leveson Inquiry. 'Mr and Mrs Dowler were subjected to intrusive and insensitive press reporting at a time of intense personal distress,' today’s report said. Unfair: Kate and Gerry McCann were denied dignity in their treatment by British newspapers . But the report found that Mrs Dowler’s 'false hope moment' was unlikely to have been caused by journalists deleting or tampering with messages, but instead by the automatic deletion of messages. 'The fact remains that the NotW hacked the phone of a dead schoolgirl called Milly Dowler,' he added. The McCanns' rights to privacy, dignity or respect were 'trumped' by the interest in them, the report says. 'They were also treated as if they were a commodity in which the public, and by extension the press, had an interest or stake that effectively trumped their individual rights to privacy, dignity or basic respect. The report added: 'If ever there were an example of a story which ran totally out of control, this is one'. Statutory press regulation would not have 'prevented the horrors of the past', Lord Hunt said tonight as he reacted to Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations. Delivering a lecture at the University of East Anglia, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) thanked Lord Justice Leveson for taking time 'to diagnose what has been seriously wrong in the world of newspapers and magazines'. Acknowledging the 'unacceptable and outrageous behaviour' of a small minority of journalists, he said the report into press standards was 'impressive'.","Lord Leveson: 'Families like the McCanns and Dowlers found themselves commodities with no rights to privacy, dignity or basic respect'

Britain's political class escaped serious criticism from Lord Justice Leveson – despite extensive evidence to his inquiry that members of it got ‘too close’ to media barons in the hope of securing the support of newspapers. Lord Justice Leveson explicitly rejected Labour claims that Mr Cameron had done a ‘deal’ with Rupert Murdoch in the run-up to the last election in return for the support of The Sun. He said the evidence ‘does not establish anything resembling a “deal” whereby News International’s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours’. PM cleared: Despite extensive evidence to Lord Justice Leveson's (right) inquiry that members of the political class got 'too close' to media barons, they have been cleared of serious criticism including David Cameron (left) after Leveson rejected claims that he had done a 'deal' with Rupert Murdoch . In the Commons, the Prime Minister seized on the finding to demand an apology from both Labour and Gordon Brown, who had claimed the Conservatives ‘shaped their policy to match the demands of News Corp’. Mr Cameron said: ‘Those who repeatedly made these allegations – including members of this House and, I have to say, the former Prime Minister – should now acknowledge they were wrong.’ Mr Brown was not available for comment last night. Trouble texts: The report pored over Mr Cameron's relationship with former News International boss Rebekah Brooks including embarrassing text read out during the inquiry . Lord Justice Leveson said that over . the last 30 years senior politicians on both sides had ‘developed too . close a relationship with the Press in a way which has not been in the . public interest’. He said . party leaders had spent too much time courting the Press and had gone . ‘too far in trying to control the supply of news and information to the . public in return for the hope of favourable treatment’. Media companies ‘should not be criticised for or restrained from’ lobbying for their interests and he said it was ‘entirely the responsibility of politicians’ to keep the public interest paramount. But most individual politicians escaped serious censure, despite detailed evidence about the way in which some on both sides courted the Murdoch empire. Lord Justice Leveson said that Mr Cameron ‘went to great lengths to secure meetings face-to-face with Mr Murdoch and other News International executives and editors’. The report also pored over his close relationship with former News International boss Rebekah Brooks, whose text exchanges with the Prime Minister caused him excruciating embarrassment when they were read out during the inquiry. It emerged that Mr Cameron even signed off the messages LOL – thinking this meant lots of love – when it actually meant ‘laugh out loud’. In a text to Mr Cameron on the day before his 2009 conference speech Mrs Brooks said: ‘I am so rooting for you tomorrow, not just as a proud friend but because professionally we’re definitely in this together.’ A further text referred to Mr Cameron’s use of a horse owned by her husband Charlie Brooks. Mr Cameron sent her a message saying: ‘The horse CB put me on. Fast, unpredictable and hard to control but fun. DC.’ The inquiry also heard evidence that the Camerons enjoyed regular ‘country suppers’ with Mrs Brooks, who is a fellow member of the so-called ‘Chipping Norton set’. Lord Justice Leveson said this ‘demonstrates how the discussion of professional matters in a very informal social environment was occurring.’ He said the pair had continued to keep in touch even after the phone hacking scandal began to take off in late 2010 but said Mr Cameron’s recollection of a call on the subject was ‘imperfect’. 'Too close': Lord Leveson said that David Cameron's close relationship with Rebekah Brooks had caused problems with perception . He said there was nothing wrong with . politicians having close friendships with media executives, but warned . it led to problems of ‘public perception’. The . report said there were ‘too many issues where the public... has been . entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has been . going on’. Mr Brown denied courting the Murdoch . empire, despite evidence to the inquiry that his wife Sarah had hosted a . pyjama party at Chequers attended by Mrs Brooks, Mr Murdoch’s wife . Wendi and daughter Elisabeth. Lord Justice Leveson concluded: ‘On a . personal level, Mr Brown was also quite close to Mrs Brooks and his . wife Sarah was described as a good friend’. The inquiry also heard evidence on how . Tony Blair had courted the Murdochs as part of a successful effort to . win the backing of The Sun. Supported report: Former Labour spin-doctor Alastair Campbell has urged the Prime Minister to back the report . This included an article for the . newspaper headlined ‘My love for the Pound’, which Alastair Campbell . said was ‘likely to be the final piece of the jigsaw before Mr Murdoch . agreed the paper would back the Labour Party at the election’. Lord . Justice Leveson raised concerns about New Labour’s ‘unprecedented’ use . of political spin. He said there was an  ‘obvious question’ about the . extent to which the party’s strategy of ‘neutralising’  hostile sections . of the Press eventually backfired and ‘resulted in diminishing public . confidence in political communications’. Speaking to the BBC, former Labour spin-doctor Mr Campbell said he supported the Leveson report and urged the Prime Minister to back it, saying: ‘This is not a bonkers proposal.’ The report examined Mr Cameron’s recruitment of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as communications chief. Lord Justice Leveson expressed surprise that George Osborne had recommended Mr Coulson, given that he had overseen a number of damaging stories about the party as editor. He added: ‘That Mr Coulson had resigned in response to the conviction and imprisonment of one of his journalists added yet another reason to question why it was that Mr Coulson’s name came to Mr Osborne’s mind.’ Lord Justice Leveson said it was ‘clear’ that inquiries did not go beyond asking Mr Coulson about the issue and accepting his assurances’. Jeremy Hunt created a ‘serious problem’ in the way he handled Rupert Murdoch’s £8billion bid for BSkyB but he did not show ‘actual bias’, the report found. Lord Justice Leveson was critical of the former Culture Secretary’s decision to appoint his special adviser Adam Smith to liaise with News Corporation over the bid, even though he was a friend of the firm’s chief lobbyist Fred Michel. He said Mr Hunt then failed to supervise his adviser properly. Lord Justice Leveson said this led to . a ‘serious hidden problem’ in the handling of the bid. It was . ‘probable’ that Mr Smith had passed confidential information to News . Corp. This could have . resulted in legal action against the Government by opponents of the bid . if it had been made public while a decision was being considered. Not 'actual bias': Jeremy Hunt created a 'serious problem' in the way he handled Rupert Murdoch's £8billion bid for BSkyB, the report found . He said the ‘interactions between those acting on behalf of media companies and politicians concerning this multi-billion-pound proposed media transaction provide a good example of how easily the relationship can become unhealthy’. But Lord Justice Leveson said that in other respects Mr Hunt had handled the bid ‘commendably’, putting in place ‘robust systems’ to ensure it was dealt with properly. He rejected outright Labour suggestions that Mr Hunt was given the job of overseeing the bid because of his known closeness to the Murdochs, saying: ‘The evidence does not begin to support a conclusion that the choice of Mr Hunt was the product of improper media pressure, still less an attempt to guarantee a particular outcome to the process.’ Lord Justice Leveson said there was ‘no credible evidence of actual bias on the part of Mr Hunt’. But he added: ‘The voluminous exchanges between Mr Michel and Mr Smith, in the circumstances give rise to a perception of bias.’ David Cameron said the report had highlighted lessons which needed to be learned about the handling of quasi-judicial decisions by ministers. But he welcomed the conclusion that the appointment of Mr Hunt had not been intended to help Rupert Murdoch and had not resulted in bias. Mr Cameron said this vindicated his decision to back Mr Hunt, who was promoted to the job of Health Secretary in September. He told MPs that Mr Hunt had ‘endured a stream of allegations with great dignity’. He went on: ‘We were right to stand by him.’ During the crisis Labour had called for Mr Hunt to resign. Lib Dem MPs, including Nick Clegg, abstained in a vote of confidence on Mr Hunt. News Corp’s bid to take total control of BSkyB was abandoned when the phone hacking scandal broke.","David Cameron has demanded an apology from Labour and Gordon Brown who claimed the Conservatives were influenced by News Corp .

David Cameron went to ‘great lengths’ to woo Rupert Murdoch’s News International newspaper empire prior to the last general election, Lord Justice Leveson said today. The judge added the Prime Minister’s closeness to senior executives like Rebekah Brooks had created a problem of ‘public perception’, although he accepted there was no ‘deal’ of newspaper support for the expectation of policy favours. This prompted Mr Cameron to demand an apology from former Prime Minister Gordon Brown who said the Conservatives 'struck a deal' with Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers to gain positive coverage. Lord Leveson said the Prime Minister had been right to accept that politicians had ‘got too close to the media’ and that the relationship needed to be set on a ‘better footing’. 'Too close': Lord Leveson said that David Cameron's close relationship with Rebekah Brooks had caused problems with perception . Politicians will now have to record all contact they have with journalists and publish it. He said: ‘The problem is public perception. This section of the report has dealt with too many issues where the public, not knowing any more than it has (or, I might say, than what it reads in the newspapers), has been entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has been going on. ‘A way of conducting relationships with the media which leads to a situation in which a public inquiry is needed to take an objective, not to say forensic, look at the matter in order to reassure the public cannot be considered as satisfactory or itself in the public interest. ‘Mr Cameron went to great lengths to secure meetings face-to-face with Mr Murdoch and other News International executives and editors. ‘The benefits of this may have played some part in the outcome but should not be overestimated. ‘The evidence does not, of course, establish anything resembling a ‘deal’ whereby News International’s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours.’ Failure: Jeremy Hunt (left) should have had more . control of his adviser Adam Smith (right) and his contact with News . Corporation lobbyist Fred Michel . Health minister Jeremy Hunt is the most senior politician to be directly criticised in the report. Mr Hunt was Culture Secretary in 2011 when he was handed responsibility for the News Corp bid to buy the whole of BSkyB. Spin: Lord Leveson also criticised New Labour's spin operation - led by Alastair Campbell . He is credited for putting in place ’wise and effective’ measures to prove he was handling the bid properly. But Mr Hunt is criticised for the way his special advisor Adam Smith had significant contact with News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel. ’Mr Smith already knew Mr Michel, and when faced with the intimacy, charm, volume and persistence of Mr Michel’s approaches, he was put in an extremely difficult position. Best practice... was not followed.’ Lord Leveson ’doubted the wisdom’ of giving Mr Smith the job. ’The consequential risks were then compounded by the cumulative effects of the lack of explicit clarity in Mr Smith’s  role, the lack of express instruction that it was clear that he fully understood, and a lack of supervision by Mr Hunt.’ It all gave a ’perception of bias’, he added. Concerns over how badly New Labour's spin operations, led for many years by Alastair Campbell, damaged public confidence in political communications were also raised by Lord Justice Leveson today. In a bid to end the 'wilderness years' of the 1980s and 1990s Labour strayed into territory that some believed marked a breakdown of 'public trust engineered by political self-interest', the report said. It added: 'If New Labour did not invent 'spin', it nevertheless found itself in an unprecedented place in relation to news management as an agenda item in its own right. 'On the one hand, its election-winning strategy in 1997 explicitly had in mind the lessons to be learned from the recent past. 'On the other, there is an obvious question about the extent to which a media strategy of 'neutralising' those sections of the press which had been hostile to the party in the 1980s and in the run-up to the 1992 general election became a victim of its own success, and resulted in diminishing public confidence in political communications.'","Lord Leveson says PM's relationship with Rebekah Brooks was bad for 'public perception'

To stand out from the crowd, the Maryland couple bought a bright yellow billboard on the busy New Jersey Turnpike, featuring a picture of themselves, their phone number, their website, and the words 'Loving couple looking to adopt.' Desperate measures: Maryland couple Orna and Jay, who did not reveal their real names, took out billboard ad space on the New Jersey Turnpike advertising that they are looking to adopt . Complicated: They said they want their adopted son Ben to have a sibling, but that the time-consuming adoption process is even more difficult the second time around because birth parents tend to look for childless couples . While Jay, a sales executive, and Orna, a doctor, hail from Maryland, they chose to buy advertising space in New Jersey because birth mothers there only have 72 hours to change their mind. Those in Maryland, on the other hand, are given a full 28 days to reverse their decision. 'We feel as a couple our goal is to market ourselves to as many people,' said Jay, who has been married to Orna for six years. 'To let them know there's an option for their 16-, 18-, 20-, or 25-year-old young woman who isn’t ready to be a mom.' The billboard, which just went up, will cost Jay and Orna a whopping $2,000 a month, but they believe it's worth it if it leads to an adoption. Indeed, they explained that the whole . process of adopting Ben took about two years, but they have hope that their . creative ad will make the process go a little faster this time. Strategic: While Jay and Orna hail from Maryland, they chose to buy advertising space in New Jersey because birth mothers there only have 72 hours to change their mind. In Maryland, they have 28 days . 'What we hope to find is that one unique situation where someone picks up the phone or goes to our website and says, ""Hey I can give a great gift to this couple,""' said Jay. On Adopt2013, the website listed on the billboard, Jay and Orno put forth their case as good parents who would provide a loving home for another adopted child. The website states that they have a three-bedroom house in 'a neighborhood full of young families,' and that one of the top elementary schools in the area is located just next door. 'With 13 nieces and nephews all under the age of 13, our second child will be surrounded by children eager to play,' they add.","Orna and Jay are from Maryland, where birth mothers are given 28 days to change their mind .

A draconian crackdown on the public’s right to know what the police are doing was demanded by Lord Justice Leveson. He called for a ban on the press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested. Also, the ‘off-the-record’ briefing of journalists would be barred, and senior police officers would be expected to log details of any contact they have with reporters and make the details widely available. A string of major scandals have been uncovered over the years by unauthorised police sources who could in future be frightened to speak out. Lord Justice Leveson said he had not found any extensive evidence of police corruption, and the scale of the problem of ‘leaks’ to reporters should be kept in proportion. He also downplayed the scale of so-called cosy relations between the police and journalists. Just some of the stories that might never have come to light: A series of disclosures to Daily Mail reporters propelled the Stephen Lawrence inquiry forward; right, Scotland Yard embroiled in a race war . The inquiry chairman said: ‘No one could reasonably conclude that inappropriately lavish entertainment is or has been rife in the Metropolitan Police Service or that the officers involved in what may be described as the most damaging evidence were corrupt. 'The issue is about perception, more than integrity.’ But the report then went on to highlight a string of scenarios where contact between police and the Press should be curtailed. He said it should be ‘mandatory’ for all officers of Acpo rank – the most senior police – to record all of their contact with the media on a ‘brief note’, explaining what the conversation was about. Where the discussion involves a more ‘significant’ matter, the note must be more detailed. He also says senior staff must consider whether they need a press officer present. It also said that Acpo guidance should ‘more specifically spell out the dangers of consuming alcohol in a setting of casual hospitality (without necessarily specifying a blanket ban)’. Lord Leveson (left) said it should be 'mandatory' for all officers of Acpo rank – the most senior police – to record all of their contact with the media on a 'brief note'. Right, Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe . The judge also wants far tighter controls on police taking journalists on operations such as raids – which provide a valuable insight to the public on how the police work – for fear of ‘violating the private rights of individuals’. The report goes on: ‘I think that it should be made clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there may be an immediate risk to the public) the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or public.’ The report suggested putting a 12-month ‘cooling off’ period into contracts that would stop former senior police officers being employed by the press. Last night, Andy Trotter of the Association of Chief Police Officers said it would need to consider the report ‘carefully’. He added: ‘Police should have a professional, open and transparent relationship with the public and the media. 'The media can provide a vital role in communicating with the public, helping society to solve crime, and holding public institutions to account.’ Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is responsible for the Metropolitan Police, rejected Leveson’s proposal for off-the-record briefings from the police to cease. ‘Clearly briefings are going to remain an important part of public life,’ he said. Lord Justice Leveson doubtless thought he was helping to protect the innocent by calling for a ban on the identification of crime suspects who have been arrested but not charged. But, if the public do not know a person is being held in custody, how are they supposed to come forward with any information they hold which could clear them, such as a cast-iron alibi? Sweeping people off the streets and locking them up in secret is the hallmark of brutal totalitarian regimes, not mature democracies. Equally chilling is the judge’s demand that senior police must keep a log – freely available to their superiors – of any contact they have with journalists. Lord Justice Leveson says he is acting in the interests of ‘transparency’. But, in reality, he risks creating a ‘closed shop’ in which police feel frightened of passing on information, even where it is of huge public interest, in case they are subject to a witch-hunt by officials who it suits to conceal inconvenient truths and restrict all communication to official channels. Journalists will be treated, wrongly, as a potential enemy best avoided, despite the overwhelming majority of reporters being interested only in exposing wrongdoing, helping the police to bring criminals to justice and defending the public’s right to know. Scandal upon scandal has been exposed by unauthorised briefings to the Press from police – not least the uncovering of the shocking failings in the original Stephen Lawrence investigation. Leveson’s report also suggested that journalists could in future be forced to identify whistleblowers to the police. Currently, journalists have protection under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act from disclosing material to the police, even if it is obtained by a source acting in an unlawful way. But the judge says there should be a consultation on changing this rule. The danger is that good citizens desperate to expose wrongdoing will not come forward if they risk being named to the police and arrested. The computer disc which contained the details of how MPs had been rampantly fiddling their expenses was technically stolen by a Westminster employee. How many guilty men will escape justice and how much corruption go undetected if the Leveson Inquiry plan is implemented in full? Six major stories that would never have been told . By CHRIS GREENWOOD . Unofficial police sources are behind some of the most important revelations of corruption and wrongdoing in modern times. Some of the stories that might never have come to light without unauthorised briefing include: . The Stephen Lawrence inquiryWhen the inquiry into the racist murder of the black 18-year-old lost its way it was off-the-record briefings that focused the minds of the country’s top police officers. A series of disclosures to Daily Mail reporters propelled the story into the public eye and led to a series of reviews and questions from the highest level of Government. Almost 30 years later, perpetrators were finally convicted and Stephen’s family finally found justice. Lord BlairWhen the then Sir Ian, now Lord, Blair occupied the office at the top of New Scotland Yard, unauthorised disclosures raised serious questions about his stewardship. One exposed his dubious decision to secretly record telephone conversations with Attorney General Lord Goldsmith. Another raised questions about a £3million IT contract with Impact Plus, a company owned by his long-term friend and skiing partner Andy Miller. When the then Sir Ian, now Lord, Blair (left) occupied the office at the top of New Scotland Yard, unauthorised disclosures raised serious questions about his stewardship. A foul-mouthed rant by then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell (right) in September might never have become public had a police note of the encounter not been passed to the Press, as there were no other witnesses . PlebgateA foul-mouthed rant by then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell in September might never have become public had a police note of the encounter not been passed to the Press, as there were no other witnesses. The ensuing scandal ultimately led to Mr Mitchell’s resignation. The Stalker AffairWhen senior Manchester police officer John Stalker was sent to Northern Ireland to head an inquiry into the shooting of Republican suspects by the RUC, he was subjected to an extraordinary smear campaign. He was suspended from duty, but junior officers privately briefed newspapers and the BBC about his treatment. All charges against him were dropped. Ali DizaeiThe actions of the corrupt Scotland Yard commander were laid bare thanks to unauthorised leaks to the Daily Mail. Information from unnamed colleagues led to intense scrutiny of his activities and eventually his conviction for perverting the course of justice. Operation CountrymanThe four-year inquiry into corruption at the City of London and Met forces might well have collapsed were it not for key off-the-record briefings. Dorset and Hampshire officers were obstructed from the start and turned to the Press to publicise their problems. The Government responded by ordering the Yard to co-operate. Legal Update: In 2009 Mr Andrew Miller complained about an article dealing with the award by the MPS of contracts to his former company, Impact Plus. He brought proceedings for libel and was successful. The Court found, in December 2012, that there were no reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Miller was a willing beneficiary of improper conduct and cronyism because of his friendship with Sir Ian Blair in respect of the award of a number of MPS contracts to Impact Plus worth millions of pounds of public money. Mr Miller was awarded £65,000 damages.","Lord Leveson calls for ban on the press or public being told by police if a crime suspect has been arrested .

An alternate turkey, named Caramel, also received a pardon, though it did not have the benefit of a face-to-beak meeting with the president. 'The office of the presidency, the most powerful position in the world, brings with it many awesome and solemn responsibilities,' Obama began. 'This is not one of them.'

Presidents have spared turkeys off and on as far back as the Lincoln era, according to the White House.

'I love the quality and detail of Theo's designs so we decided to work together on this collection. 'I am so excited about it and everyone seems to love it.' The collection, which has been crafted from sterling silver and yellow enamel, combines Theo Fennell’s rock’n’roll aesthetic with Ollie's qurky style and features two of his favourite motifs: the wolf and the feather. 'Feathers are definitely the new crucifix,' said trendsetter Ollie. You heard it here first, MIC fans. Motif: The range, which is priced between £50-£265, features Proudlock's favourite motifs, the feather and a wolf .

'I thought this would be the neatest way to color it at the time' 'One day my daughter didn't get around . to making me a picture in time, so right before I left she quickly drew . me a line drawing to take with me. 'On my flights to work I keep a . sketchbook to draw on the plane and have coloured pencils handy.

A high-society doctor who committed suicide after being caught up in the 1960s Profumo scandal was the victim of a miscarriage of justice, a leading lawyer has claimed. Outspoken barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC today launched a book which he hopes will prove osteopath Stephen Ward was not a pimp, as he was accused of being. He argues that Ward was only prosecuted for living on the earnings of prostitutes because Home Secretary Henry Brooke wanted a scapegoat for the scandal, which nearly brought down the Conservative government. Innocent? Stephen Ward, pictured outside his trial in 1963, was nothing more than a scapegoat for the Profumo scandal, according to a leading barrister . Campaign: Geoffrey Robertson QC has published a new book about the case seeking to vindicate Ward . Supporters: The lawyer posing today with Andrew Lloyd-Webber and former model Mandy Rice-Davies . The book, being published by Biteback Publishing, also claims that Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies were not prostitutes, but instead lived off Ward's earnings as a doctor and portrait painter. Mr Robertson, a human rights lawyer who defended Salman Rushdie, is not the only high-profile figure to be speaking out on Ward's behalf during the 50th anniversary of the Profumo scandal. Andrew Lloyd Webber has composed a new musical, entitled Stephen Ward, which premieres in London this month. Ward is said to have introduced John Profumo, then Secretary of State for War, to Miss Keeler at a party at the stately home Cliveden, in Buckinghamshire. After it emerged that she was also having an affair with a Soviet attaché, Profumo was forced to resign. Quit: John Profumo was forced to resign from the Cabinet when it emerged that he had been having an affair with alleged escort Christine Keeler . High society: Ward pictured with Keeler, Grundie Heiber and Sally Norrie shortly before the scandal broke . Claims: Miss Rice-Davies and Miss Keeler leaving court during a hearing in Ward's trial . The Profumo affair was considered . emblematic of the early 1960s, a time when the traditional British way . of life was rapidly being replaced by modern customs. John . Profumo was forced to resign as Secretary of State for War in 1963 . after it emerged that he had lied to Parliament about his relationship . with model and showgirl Christine Keeler. The Conservative minister was 27 years older than his lover, and was married to actress Valerie Hobson. The . scandal was even believed to endanger national security when it was . revealed that Ms Keeler was also having an affair with Soviet spy . Yevgeny Ivanov, as well as notorious drug dealer Johnny Edgecombe. When . Harold Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister later that year, his . decision was widely thought to be linked to the fall-out from the . affair. Profumo, who died in 2006, devoted the rest of his life to rehabilitating his reputation through charity work. Ward was put on trial, but took an overdose of sleeping tablets shortly after the judge's summing-up and was convicted while he lay in a coma, from which he never awoke. Mr Robertson identifies two senior judges - Lord Parker (Chief Justice at the time) and Lord Widgery (the next Chief Justice) - who allegedly hid evidence from the jury which would have secured Ward's acquittal. He explains 12 mistakes of law that supposedly produced an overwhelmingly unfair trial, and which he says require Ward's conviction to be posthumously overturned. At a news conference today to launch the book, he claimed that the legal establishment has tried to cover up its behaviour during the trial. The book, called Stephen Ward Was Innocent, OK, has been sent to the Criminal Cases Review Commission as an application to have the conviction overturned. Mr Robertson said: 'This will provide an opportunity for the Court of Appeal to reconsider the worst unrectified miscarriage of justice in modern British history.' His book, and the message that the time has come to overturn Ward's conviction, is endorsed by the two most recent Directors of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC and Lord Macdonald, the publishers said. Others attending the news conference included Ms Rice-Davies and Lord Lloyd Webber.","Stephen Ward introduced Christine Keeler and John Profumo .

Critics have been less than complimentary about his latest record, with one describing it as like being ‘serenaded by a well-suited mortgage adviser’. But that hasn’t stopped the BBC from arranging a whole day of programming dedicated to Gary Barlow – and heralding the Take That singer as a ‘bona fide national treasure’. Despite lukewarm reviews for Since I Saw You Last, Radio 2 is planning to broadcast a day of interviews with Barlow, before showing a concert it describes as ‘no ordinary performance’. 'National treasure': The BBC will flood the airwaves with Gary Barlow's voice next week . The first interview will be in the morning on Ken Bruce’s breakfast show on December 11. He will then join Steve Wright on the presenter’s afternoon show. Barlow, 42, will later take part in an online question and answer session, before a live performance of his album is broadcast on the Radio 2 website to millions of listeners. Does Gary Barlow deserve to have an entire day dedicated to him on the BBC? The show will also be available to watch . on television via the red button service, and highlights will be made . available on the BBC website.

Thousands of women and girls have undergone procedures for 'designer vaginas' in the past five years because internet porn is distorting perceptions of what is normal, doctors have warned. In the past decade, cases of genital cosmetic surgery have risen five-fold and more than 2,000 women are now having the procedure on the NHS each year. Over the past five years more than 250 such procedures were performed on girls under the age of 14, NHS figures show. Thousands of women and girls have undergone procedures for 'designer vaginas' in the past five years because internet porn is distorting perceptions of what is normal, doctors warned (picture posed by model) But experts warned this was merely the . 'tip of the iceberg' since private cosmetic surgeons are not required . to contribute records for official figures. The . Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) today proposed . restrictions on the procedures in both NHS and private clinics. The . most common kind of female cosmetic surgery is labiaplasty, in which . the size of the patient's labia minora is reduced. This can be done on . legitimate medical grounds, as a treatment for women with concerns about . hygiene, difficulties during sex, or discomfort duing exercise. But . Dame Suzi Leather, chairman of the Royal College's ethics committee, . said the recent rise in cases had been 'fuelled in part by the mass . media and inaccurate advertising'. 'Some . women are requesting it solely for cosmetic reasons and these decisions . are not always being made on an informed understanding of the normal . variations that exist, but influenced by images from popular culture and . the pornography industry,' she said. 'We need to inform women that everyone is unique and that variation in appearance is normal in the vast majority of cases.' Thomas . Baldwin, a philosopher who also sits on ethics committee, added: 'The . misapprehension arises from the prominence of just one type of ""neat"" genital appearance, the type to be found prominently depicted in . pornography.' But . complications from the surgery are common, with ruptures reported in a . third of cases and NHS doctors reporting seeing women who have suffered . complications caused by private-sector surgery. There . is also a lack of research into the long-term risks posed by . labiaplasty, the report warns. Some women who have undergone the . procedure can suffer damage to sexual function and discomfort when . wearing tight clothes. In the short term, risks can include bleeding and wound infection. Labiaplasty: Complications from the surgery are common, with ruptures reported in a third of cases and NHS doctors reporting seeing women who have suffered complications caused by private-sector surgery . The . RCOG's ethics committee warned that teenage girls could be undergoing . unnecessary surgery that is anatomically not much different from female . genital mutilation. According . to NHS figures cited by the British Society for Paediatric and . Adolescent Gynaecology (BritSPAG), 266 girls under the age of 14 had . genital surgery between 2008 and 2012, which was carried out 'for . unknown reasons and with unknown consequences'. The society warned that undergoing labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long-term problems. 'The . younger a girl begins her labiaplasty trajectory, the higher the number . of operations over her lifetime and the greater the risk of scarring . and sensitivity loss,' the report said. Instead . teenage girls should be told 'unambiguously' when they have normal . genitals; those showing signs of psychological problems related to their . body image should be directed to paediatric psychologists, it says. Experts . also said that surgery should not be conducted on the NHS unless it is a . medical requirement and that private surgeons should give women . information on the normal range of genital appearance. Consultant . plastic surgeon Paul Banwell, from the British Association of Aesthetic . Plastic Surgeons, said he welcomed the new guidelines. But he told the BBC that clinicians should be sensitive to potential problems. 'An . asymmetrical labia can lead to functional problems as well as aesthetic . problems. Over 50 per cent of my patients see me due to functional . reasons,' he said. 'Only a small proportion are there for purely aesthetic reasons.' However, he did concede that he had seen the number of patients requesting the procedure soar in recent years.","Number of labiaplasty procedures on NHS have risen five-fold in past decade .

Statistics show that since 2003 there have been 1,323 deaths in . hospitals where dehydration was the underlying cause, and a further 273 . in care homes. Over the same period 499 hospital patients and 67 care home residents died from conditions linked to malnutrition. There . were many more cases in which patients were severely dehydrated or . malnourished when they died, but it was not the underlying cause of . their death. Officials said that illnesses such as dementia make patients prone to dehydration and malnutrition. Nonetheless . Norman Lamb, the minister for care, said: ‘Failings of care that may . contribute to people being malnourished or dehydrated are entirely . unacceptable.

RBS is now accused of diverting tax payments by small businesses into its own accounts, depriving the taxpayer of millions . RBS employed a 'hit squad' that diverted tax payments from small businesses into the bank's own coffers, it has been claimed. In a setup that deprived the Exchequer of millions of pounds of revenues, struggling firms saw their loans called in by the group's problem lending division. In one instance, the bank - which is 82per cent owned by the taxpayer - told business owners it was 'not interested in what is owed to HMRC', and demanded repayment. In some cases, this pushed otherwise solvent companies into administration. The damning allegations come days after RBS was accused of killing off good businesses for profit. It was accused of calling in loans and sending firms to the wall so it could pick up the companies' property at knock-down prices. Now fresh allegations say the group, which is set to pay £500million in bonuses to staff this year, seized money earmarked for tax payments. Cambridgeshire hotel owners Paul and Lucy Smith said they were not allowed to pay tax on the sale of one of their hotels. They now face a huge tax bill after the bank, which told them it was 'not interested' in their bill to HMRC, took all of their funds for the repayment of a loan, according to the couple. Another couple, Mike and Diane Hockin, said funds earmarked for VAT payments from their profitable property business were taken by RBS, plunging their business into administration and leaving them facing a fight with the taxman. A spokesman for RBS said: 'When companies reach a very high level of distress, with insufficient funds to cover all their payments, we will help them manage their difficult cash flow problems. 'We try to ensure that essential costs, such as wages and fuel bills are met which enables the company to continue operating, and slowly bring down the level of debt with their creditors. 'It is the customer's role to direct us over which payments they would like to make.'
