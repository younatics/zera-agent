"(CNN) -- The Libyan government tried and failed to swap three captured Dutch military personnel for two Libyan Air Force jets whose pilots defected with their warplanes to the European island nation of Malta last month. Maltese officials who helped negotiate the release of the Dutch prisoners in conjunction with Greek diplomats on Thursday, say they rejected Libya's request for the return of the Libyan Mirage fighter planes. In a telephone interview with CNN, a spokesman for Malta's foreign ministry said Libya sent Mohamad Tahir Siala, a senior Libyan diplomat, on a private jet to Malta on Wednesday to meet with Lawrence Gonzi, the Maltese prime minister. ""During the discussion it was discussed whether Malta would give back the two Mirages in exchange for the Dutch prisoners,"" said ministry spokesman Melvyn Mangion. In an interview with the Times of Malta newspaper this week, Gonzi said he refused this suggestion and insisted that the Dutch prisoners had to be released immediately without any conditions. The three Dutch navy personnel were captured by Libyan security forces on February 27, after they tried to evacuate a Dutch citizen from Libya by helicopter. The prisoners, two men and a woman, were later shown on Libyan state television along with their Lynx helicopter. Libyan state TV also showed captured weapons, and claimed that the crew had been operating a fighter helicopter in Libyan territory in violation of international law. After several rounds of negotiations this week, ""eventually the Libyan authorities accepted to release the Dutch prisoners without getting the two Mirages back,"" said Mangion. The Libyan government has reportedly made several requests to Maltese officials to have its fighter planes returned, since their pilots landed unexpectedly in Malta on February 21. The pilots said they refused to carry out order by the government of Moammar Gadhafi to bomb Libyan protesters. Maltese officials say the two pilots have since requested political asylum. On Thursday, the Dutch foreign ministry announced Libyan authorities had released the three Dutch prisoners and that they were in good condition after being flown from Tripoli to Athens, Greece. Malta, a small island nation less than 250 miles off the Libyan coast, has long had close economic and political ties with the Gadhafi regime. Some observers call Malta the ""gateway to Libya."" But the increasingly bloody conflict in Libya has put this small country in an increasingly precarious position. Since forces loyal to Gadhafi began a deadly crackdown on unarmed protesters last month, Malta worked with the U.S., British and other governments to help evacuate foreigners fleeing Libya. However, the Maltese government also announced it is unwilling to play a larger diplomatic or military role in the growing confrontation between the European Union and Libya. ""The Maltese prime minister reiterated that Malta will not be used as a military base should there be an action against Libya,"" said Mangion, the Maltese foreign ministry spokesman, citing a neutrality cause in Malta's constitution. ""Malta will not act as a mediator between Libya and the EU, even though Libya formally asked Malta to,"" Mangion added. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Three Dutch navy personnel were captured by Libyan forced on February 27 .

"(CNN) -- As Norway struggles to come to terms with its greatest loss of life in decades, all eyes are on the man charged in the explosion in central Oslo and the deadly shooting rampage at a youth camp. While police have not officially named him, Norwegian television and newspaper reports have identified the suspect as 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik. A rambling 1,518-page manifesto purportedly written by someone using that name offered a rationale and action plan for terror attacks like those inflicted on Norway last week. There are clear pictures of what Breivik looks like, at least, via images showing him with blond hair, blue-green eyes and chiseled features. In some cases, he's wearing seemingly preppy clothes, though in others he strikes a far more militaristic stance. And  the suspect will ""explain himself"" in court on Monday, attorney Geir  Lippestad -- who claimed to represent Breivik -- told Norway's TV2 late  Saturday. Yet even with these photos, even with the voluminous text in his manifesto, even if he does detail his reasoning Monday, troubling questions are likely to remain. Chief among them is how and why a native  Norwegian turned on his countrymen. What is known is that Breivik is a member of the Oslo Pistol Club and has three weapons registered in his name, according to leading Norwegian newspaper VG, which cited Norway's official weapons register. They are a Glock pistol, a rifle and a shotgun, VG reported. Breivik is registered as having run a company that produced  ""vegetables, melons, roots and tubers"" -- an industry which allows  access to large amounts of fertilizer that can be used for explosives -- according to state-run broadcaster NRK. An  employee at a Norwegian agricultural cooperative told CNN that the man  identified in media reports as the suspect in last Friday's attacks  bought six tons of fertilizer from her company in May. Oddmy  Estenstad, of Felleskjopet Agr, said she did not think the order was  strange at the time because the suspect has a farm, but after the Oslo  attack she called police because she knew the material can be used to  make bombs. NRK also reported that Breivik does not have a military background and, in fact, was exempt from Norway's mandatory military service. He has not had any special military training, it adds on its website. He was a youth and adult member of the conservative Fremskrittspartiet (FrP) or Progress Party, VG newspaper reports, remaining involved until 2007. The party's most prominent manifesto pledge is to minimize immigration. His membership was confirmed by a senior party member, Jonas Kallmyr, who is quoted by VG as saying that encountering Breivik was ""like meeting Hitler before World War II."" In the manifesto, which police said was posted online the day of the attacks, a writer claiming to be Breivik writes positively of the Progress Party, calling it ""the only major political party in Norway that has voiced any serious opposition to the madness of Muslim immigration."" But he only, effusively claims membership as a ""Justiciar Knight"" in what he calls the pan-European ""Conservative Revolutionary Movements in Europe."" The philosophy presented in the document -- which also serves as part diatribe, part confessional and part action plan -- targets so-called ""cultural Marxist/multicultural ideals."" The writer makes clear that he not only opposes multiculturalism in Europe, including any increase in the number of  in immigrants or Muslims, but that he has thought out how to use violence to combat it. The manifesto and a related video are titled ""2083: A European Declaration of Independence,"" a date that the author later explains is the year he believes a European civil war will end with the execution of what he calls ""cultural Marxists."" This ""civil war"" would come in three phases, he predicts. The first runs through 2030 and includes ""open source warfare, military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems (and) further consolidation of conservative forces."" Between 2030 and 2070, he calls for ""more advanced forms of resistance groups (and the) preparation of pan-European coup d'etats."" The final stage features the deposition of Europe's leadership and ""implementation of a cultural conservative political agenda."" A vitriolic hatred of outside forces, and desire to oust them from Europe, pervades the document. But it especially targets Muslims, culminating in 2083 with their deportation from the continent. Such animosity is consistent with a post in Breivik's name on an online forum, Document.no, from December 2009, talks about non-Muslim teenagers being ""in an especially precarious situation with regards to being harassed by Islamic youth."" ""I know of many hundred occasions where non-Muslims have been robbed, beaten up and harassed by Islamic gangs,"" the post reads. ""I had a best friend between the ages of 12-17 who was a Pakistani, so I was one of the many protected, cool 'potatoes' that had protection. But this also made me see the hypocrisy up close and personal and made me nauseous."" Such anti-Islamic sentiment is nothing new in Norway or other European nations, where there has been resistance against increasing numbers of Muslims and their practices. About 3% of Norway's population in 2010 -- 144,000 people -- were Muslim, but that was expected to more than double to 6.5% over the next 20 years, according to a report released earlier this year by The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. That is one of the largest percentage increases in Muslim populations across all of Europe, thanks in part to fertility rates significantly higher than those of non-Muslims. Another post in Breivik's name in October 2009 advises ""Hans"", described as the founder of Document.no, to ""develop an alternative to the violent extreme Norwegian Marxist organisations Blitz, SOS Rasisme and Rod Ungdom"" -- all left-wing movements in Norway. ""The conservatives dare not openly express their viewpoints in public because they know that the extreme Marxists will trump them. We cannot accept the fact that the Labour Party is subsidising these violent ""Stoltenberg jugend, who are systematically terrorising the politically conservative,"" the post reads. He is making a reference to the youth movement of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who heads the Labour Party. The manifesto's author does not telegraph his plan for July 22, even as he extensively delves into bomb-making techniques, evading authorities and his long-range military ambitions. But he is sharply critical of leadership of Norway, with last week's attacks targeting government buildings and a youth camp run by the ruling Labour Party, blaming them for embracing ideals that allowed the ""Islamification of Europe."" The writer states he was moved to action in 1999 by  ""my government's involvement"" in NATO's strikes during the Kosovo  campaign, claiming this campaign wrongly targeted ""our Serbian brothers (who)  wanted to drive Islam out by deporting the Albanian Muslims back to  Albania."" He also criticizes ""my government's cowardly handling of  the Muhammad cartoon issue"" -- a reference to the Norwegian government's  apology for the nation's private newspapers having repeatedly published  the controversial cartoon. Another reference blasts Norway, home of the  Nobel awards, for awarding a peace prize to late Palestinian leader  Yasser Arafat. Speaking in both specific and general terms, the manifesto's author doesn't hide his militant expertise or aims. But it is only near the end of the document that he appears willing to take matters into his own hands, citing ""the old saying, 'if you want something done, then do it yourself.'"" Acting National Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim told reporters Sunday said that the suspect, arrested on Utoya island after gunning down at least 86 people there after killing at least seven in the Oslo bombing, insisted he acted alone. Police still say, though, that they haven't ruled out others may not have been involved, and the manifesto does allude to like-minded right-wing revolutionaries. That said, the document's author does predict ""all my friends and family (will) detest me and call me a monster,"" and that media will ""have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate, vilify and demonize."" But ultimately, he writes that he believes he and other revolutionaries will be remembered fondly, part of his rallying cry for ""the emerging Western European conservative resistance movement."" ""Your name will be remembered for centuries,"" the document states. ""You will forever be celebrated by your people as a martyr for your country, protecting your culture and fighting for your kin and for Christendom."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Cynthia Wamwayi contributed to this report.","The 32-year-old suspect insists he acted alone, the national police chief says .

"(CNN) -- Togo international striker Emmanuel Adebayor completed his transfer from English Premier League champions Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur Tuesday. Adebayor spent last season on loan at the London club, finishing their top scorer with 18 goals in 37 appearances. The 28-year-old was expected to make the move permanent, but negotiations stalled over his personal terms. ""It may have taken longer than expected but I am delighted to be back at Tottenham Hotspur. I really enjoyed my time here last season and I am hoping we can achieve great things together again,"" he told the club's official website. He also tweeted: ""I'm back!!!! Tottenham here I come!! I'm hungry for goals...Get ready."" Adebayor is the third signing for new Tottenham coach Andre Villas-Boas after Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson joined from German club Hoffenheim and Belgian international defender Jan Vertonghen switched from Dutch giants Ajax. Tottenham, who finished fourth last season, began their campaign with a 2-1 defeat at Newcastle, with their attack lacking a cutting edge and with Jermain Defoe as their only recognized senior striker. Adebayor had fallen out of favor at big-spending City, who opened their title defense with a 3-2 home win over promoted Southampton. He started his career in England in 2006 with Tottenham's arch rivals Arsenal, before moving to City in 2009. He also spent time on loan at Spanish giants Real Madrid in the 2010-11 season. In other transfer news Tuesday, Manchester United sealed the signing of defender Alexander Buttner from Vitesse Arnhem on a five-year contract. The 23-year-old Buttner is the second Dutchman to join up at Old Trafford in a week after the arrival of Robin van Persie from Arsenal. ""Alexander is one of the best young left backs in Europe and we're delighted to sign him,"" United manager Alex Ferguson told the club's official website. Fellow EPL side Norwich City strengthened their defense by signing Cameroon defender Sebastien Bassong from Tottenham on a three-year deal. Bassong, who played for his country at the 2010 World Cup, was formerly at Newcastle with new Norwich manager Chris Hughton.","Emmanuel Adebayor transfers from Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur .

"(CNN) -- Toy manufacturer LEGO, famous for its small plastic stackable bricks, is not allowed to register one of them as its trademark, the European Court of Justice has ruled. The Danish company was granted a trademark for a three-dimensional image of a red eight-stud brick in 1999, for use throughout the European Union. Canadian toy manufacturer Mega Brands, which makes similar plastic bricks, argued that LEGO violated trademark legislation, and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled in favor of Mega Brands on Tuesday. ""This was the court of final instance, and we have no option but to note the court's ruling,"" said Peter Kjaer, the head of LEGO's Intellectual Property Section. The ruling cannot be appealed. The issue was whether the famous LEGO brick served a technical function. European law says companies can trademark graphic images like words, designs, the shape of their goods and packaging -- but trademarking a product's shape, if that shape is ""necessary to obtain a technical result,"" is not allowed, the court said. LEGO argued that did not apply to its brick, because ""bricks with virtually the same function can have other appearances,"" Kjaer said. In making its decision, the court referred to an earlier case involving the electronics makers Philips and Remington over the shape of an electric razor. ""Patents can protect technical solutions, such as the means to interconnect toy bricks, but patent protection is limited in time and LEGO's patents for the basic brick have long expired,"" Mega Brands said in a statement after the ruling. ""Put simply, a trademark registration cannot be used to confer a potentially everlasting monopoly on a useful product configuration."" Kjaer said the decision will confuse LEGO customers. ""It is naturally a matter of concern to us that use of the brick by others can dilute the trademark,"" he said. ""But the worst aspect is that consumers will be misled. Analyses show that 40-60 percent of shoppers believe they are buying a LEGO product when in fact they are purchasing a different product. Shoppers can see there is a different name on the box, but they believe it is a product line or company owned by us.""","LEGO may not trademark its iconic plastic brick .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- For many it's the adrenaline, the thrill of scaling buildings to scrawl their gang's signature in huge black letters from the highest point possible. For some, it's also political -- a way to leave their mark on a city they feel has turned its back on them. They are Sao Paulo's pixadores or taggers, marginalized youth who prowl the streets late at night armed with paint cans and rollers. They have defaced buildings with Celtic-looking lettering across downtown and along many of the city's main roads. ""Where I come from, the only way to get famous is being a professional football player or drug dealer,"" says Cripta Djan, one of the city's more outspoken pixadores and gang leaders. ""The other way is with pixacao."" Just don't call it graffiti. Djan says pixadores don't want to be pigeonholed as graffiti artists and aren't interested in beauty. Instead, he says they are rebels who want to defy authority and break the law. ""It's class warfare,"" he says. ""Our society is very capitalist. You're only worth what you own. With pixacao you can invert the values. You don't have to have money to be recognized. You just need paint and you can write your name all over the city."" Pixadores live in poor suburbs but their preferred target is seedy, downtown Sao Paulo, where visibility is guaranteed. They say that in the wealthy neighborhoods their signatures would disappear in a day. They leave their mark on bridges and underpasses, invade abandoned buildings to gain access to the top floors and scale skyscrapers by climbing from one window frame to another. Some have fallen and died. See how Kenyan artists target corrupt politicians . Pixacao emerged in the 1980s in Sao Paulo, a sprawling city of 20 million people where the division between rich and poor is vast. Pixacao has since spread to other cities in Brazil. Well-known pixadores like Djan have participated in international art events but they invariably end up sparring with organizers. ""If there's no transgression, it's not pixacao,"" says Cripta, who recently defaced a church in Berlin when he was invited to give a workshop at the Bienal there. While pixadores have fascinated art afficiandos, they don't necessarily have many fans among the rest of Sao Paulo's population. ""Those guys are vandals,"" an office worker says. ""We were better off under the dictatorship when at least a minimum of order was maintained."" ""We should have harsher laws and better education,"" another woman says. On Thursday nights, hundreds of pixadores converge on a street in the center to brag about their latest feats and plan their next targets as they drink beer and smoke cigarettes and marijuana. They spray the names of their gangs on walls and compose rap songs, about everything from Brazil's consumer society to Bob Marley. They are mostly young men, but a few women are also active pixadores. A young mother and student, Michelle says she formed a gang with eight other women. ""It's adrenaline, art, freedom of expression,"" she says. ""You have an idea and you want to rebel.""","Art and law breaking is part of the same recipe for Brazilian street artists .

"(CNN) -- India is looking to Pakistan for answers after online threats and text messages sparked mass panic among migrant workers and students who hail from the country's northeast. Indian Home Minister Shri Sushil Kumar Shinde said in a statement issued Monday that ""elements based in Pakistan"" had used social media to circulate false pictures and stories. Students and workers from the northeastern state of Assam said last week they received text messages threatening retribution for ethnic violence that has gripped their state in recent weeks. The texts and rumors prompted thousands of people to flee cities across India, including Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore, the country's technology and outsourcing hub. Pictures showed crowded station platforms and packed railway carriages although the situation is now calmer. Rumors send thousands fleeing in India . The Indian government also said on Monday that it had blocked a total of 245 web pages for hosting provocative content. It said that images and video had been doctored, inciting comments from bloggers and users of social media and the sending of ""hate SMSes."" ""The initial response from international social networking sites indicates that such content has been hosted from outside the country and to a large extent from a neighboring country (Pakistan),"" according to a statement from India's Information and Technology Ministry. Mass text messages to more than five people have also been banned. Shinde said he had expressed his concern about the misuse of social networking sites in a phone call to Rehman Malik, Pakistan's interior minister. He asked for Pakistan's cooperation in investigating the claims. However, according to media reports, Malik said he would investigate only if India provided evidence to back up its assertion that the content originated in Pakistan. India's northeast is home to more than 200 ethnic and tribal groups. Violence erupted in Assam in July after two Muslim boys were shot by members of the Bodos tribe, local police said. Muslims retaliated by killing four Bodos. That triggered widespread rioting and since then at least 80 people have died and more than 300,000 have been displaced. The Bodos, who are mainly Hindu, migrated to India decades ago but they fear being marginalized by the increasing number of Muslims, who cross the border illegally from Bangladesh.","Indian minister blames ""elements in Pakistan"" for circulating false stories .

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- The General Services Administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from Hawaii even though he is based at the GSA's Kansas City, Missouri, office, a CNN investigation has found. It cost more than $24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland United States over the past year. He is among several hundred GSA ""virtual"" workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years. Under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they're actually assigned. The Kansas City employee, who started his job in January 2011, is paid $84,440 and works from his home in Honolulu, a GSA representative confirmed. In the past year, according to GSA travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. Four of those trips were to St. Louis; four were to Washington, with a side trip to Cincinnati; and one was to San Diego. The total cost to taxpayers was $24,221. Jason Klumb, the GSA's regional administrator for Kansas City, defended the hire. ""The cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants,"" Klumb said. ""And when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred."" Klumb called the GSA's teleworking program ""a successful program that's going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers."" But a GSA spokeswoman said, ""We are not going to defend this type of travel."" And a GSA employee in Kansas City, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in Hawaii to work for the Kansas City region was ludicrous. ""It doesn't make sense,"" the employee said. ""When you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the Kansas City area. It would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from Honolulu to Washington, D.C., where a lot of business is done."" Dan Tangherlini, who was appointed acting GSA administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program. ""I think the most important part for the GSA to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case,"" he said. ""If we have someone who is working in Nebraska but reporting to Boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they're providing, and you've got to give me the business case. You've got to explain to me why that's a cost-effective move for the American people, and that's a new standard that we're asking everyone at GSA to adhere to."" The GSA ""virtual employee"" program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested details about the GSA's teleworking program in June. That followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly $750,000 in travel costs between October 2010 and June 2011. ""The American people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program,"" according to a letter from committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, to the GSA. The details requested by Issa about the GSA program have not been provided to the committee. CNN also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal Freedom of Information Act but has been repeatedly told by the GSA that FOIA staff members have not finished compiling the material. The General Services Administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a $26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non-military procurement. Congress launched an investigation into the GSA after a scathing inspector general's report issued this year showed lavish spending -- $823,000 -- at the agency's Western Regions Conference in Las Vegas in October 2010. The controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. The revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the GSA. Jeff Neely, the GSA official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agency's administrator, Martha Johnson. Two of Johnson's deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. Tangherlini, a former Treasury Department official, took over as acting GSA administrator. In addition to the Las Vegas conference, the GSA apparently spent $330,000 to relocate an employee from Denver to Hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two-year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a GSA event planner. And 84 GSA employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff -- all subjects of inspector general investigations -- are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than $1 million in taxpayer money. In July, a CNN investigation revealed that the GSA's Kansas City office spent more than $20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. While the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion-dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free-spending culture that went on for years at the GSA's Kansas City regional headquarters. GSA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agency's practices are under a top-down review. CNN's Sara Anwar, Elizabeth M. Nunez and Tom Cohen contributed to this report. Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The policeman tapping on our car window makes it clear we are in a no-go area before placing his hand over the lens of our camera. Later, filming across the road, a Chinese soldier approaches and makes it clear it is time to move on. Things are tense around the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Chinese military vehicles are clearly visible parked around the side of the building. Within minutes of our arrival there's a flurry of activity, as soldiers and police suddenly appear speaking into walkie-talkies and making phone calls. Large protests during the weekend have raised the alert. Thousands of people across China took to the streets outside Japanese consulates. Japanese-owned businesses and restaurants were vandalized and cars overturned. It is all over a group of rocky uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that Japan says it owns -- a claim China vigorously disputes. Maritime disputes not just about China . ""The Diaoyu Islands are ours, they are a part of China. It is as if they are our home. If a thief breaks into our home, don't we have to drive the thief out?"" activist Tsang Kin Shing asked. Tsang took it upon himself to claim the islands for China. The Hong Kong-based activist, known as ""Bull,"" joined others who swam out to the islands in a symbolic protest. They were detained by Japanese police but later released. Bull is happy to proclaim himself a Chinese nationalist, but he's no fan of the ruling Communist party. 14 held after raising flag . ""The Diaoyu island movement is not only aimed at the Japanese, it is also aimed at communist rule,"" he said. ""We want to use it to educate our people to fight for their rights and make China truly democratic and strong."" The Diaoyu Islands -- known by Japan as Senkaku -- are indeed many things to many people. There are potential resource riches here: oil and gas and it is strategically vital. Japanese activists too have swum ashore, raising their flag. Asia's most dangerous waters . ""I believe that our landing was success if we could show that Senkaku islands are Japan's territory and we the Japanese must protest by ourselves,"" said Japanese politician Yoshihiro Kojima. It has touched off a diplomatic row. Chinese analysts like Guo Xiangang, the Deputy Director of the China Institute of International Studies -- a think tank connected to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- says it is rooted in history and age-old hatred but reasserted Beijing's sovereignty claim. ""There shouldn't be any discussion on Diaoyu Island. It has always been a part of China,"" he said. When it comes to China's relations with Japan, history runs deep and often venomous. The islands are symbolic of what many in China see as unfinished business, redressing the impact of Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s. China says its claim on Diaoyu extends back hundreds of years. Japan says China ceded sovereignty when it lost the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. Japan's surrender in World War II clouded the issue again. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972 Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. That, says Guo, is where the current troubles begin. ""The U.S. handed over the island to Japan for its own purpose during the Cold War. So, personally, I think the U.S. should take the blame for the dispute of Diaoyu island,"" he said. The U.S. says it is not taking a position in the current dispute. But it is treaty bound to defend its ally Japan. Adding to the tension, the U.S. and Japan have started joint war games. It is a routine annual event but this year the aim is to seize an island. For now this is just an exercise, but with tensions running high, there are fears it could become reality.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama offered comfort Sunday night to the survivors and the families of the 12 people killed in a mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, never once mentioning by name the man accused of opening fire in a crowded movie theater. ""I confessed to them that words are always inadequate in these kinds of situations, but that my main task was to serve as a representative of the entire country and let them know that we are thinking about them at this moment, and will continue to think about them each and every day,"" Obama told reporters after the meeting at the University of Colorado Hospital, one of several area medical centers that treated the 58 people wounded in Friday's attack. Though much attention has been paid to the ""perpetrator of this evil act,"" that spotlight will fade, leaving behind just the good memories of those impacted by the tragedy, Obama said.

James Holmes, 24, is being held in connection with the shootings early Friday morning and the subsequent discovery of his booby-trapped apartment, which the authorities believe he rigged before leaving for the Century Aurora 16 multiplex. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday morning. Obama recounted stories told to him by the victims' families and those recovering from injuries. ""It reminds you that even in the darkest of days, life continues and people are strong,"" the president said. ""Out of this darkness a brighter day is going to come."" Obama spoke before the start of a prayer vigil that brought together state and local officials with thousands of residents. Remembering the victims . Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper read the names of those killed. And to each name, the crowd responded: ""We will remember."" Pastor Robin Holland led a prayer for comfort. ""City of Aurora, the healing has begun. Your presence here is the step of healing that this nation needs to see. And I am so proud to be a citizen of Aurora, Colorado,"" he said. Residents lit candles, while balloons, flowers and simple, white crosses collected at a makeshift memorial. ""It is not this senseless act of violence that marks us as a community. It is the lives and acts of these heroes and the innumerable acts of kindness, love, and care for our neighbors that defines who we are,"" Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan said at the vigil. ""We will reclaim our city in the name of goodness, kindness and compassion."" Massacre suspect's neighbor: 'I'm counting my lucky stars' The man accused of opening fire inside the theater left a trail of evidence that the police say suggests the shooting was part of a calculated plan that included killing anyone who tried to learn more about him in the aftermath of the attack. The authorities have said little about what they believe was the motive of the accused shooter, though investigators say there is evidence planning was under way for months. Holmes received a high volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses, which the police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the attack and those found at his apartment, said Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates. ""What we're seeing here is evidence of, I think, some calculation and deliberation,"" Oates said. Gov. Hickenlooper told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that he spent a day going from hospital to hospital, talking with survivors. He concluded that Holmes was a person who wanted to terrorize and instill fear in people's lives, but said he can't conceive of a motive. ""This is a deeply troubled, twisted, delusional person,"" he said. Shooting survivors recount Colorado movie theater horror . One survivor, Josh Nowlan, sustained gunshot wounds, but said he is happy just to be alive. He wouldn't be, he said, if the suspect's weapon had not jammed. ""I know I wouldn't be here. If that gun did not jam, I am full certain that I probably would not be here,"" he said from his hospital bed Saturday. Echoing Nowlan's comments, a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation said Sunday that a semi-automatic rifle used in the killings jammed, apparently because of a problem with the 100-shot magazine feeding it. The military-style AR-15 had a separately purchased drum magazine, which can have trouble feeding bullets into the firing chamber if the gun is fired rapidly, the source told CNN on condition of anonymity. Victims recalled through poignant stories . Investigators say the rifle was one of three guns used by the suspect, along with a shotgun and a .40-caliber pistol. Police gained access Saturday to Holmes' apartment after intentionally detonating two rigged explosives. Technicians, with the help of a robot, worked to handle traps, wires and possible explosive and incendiary devices, Jim Yacone, a special agent with the FBI, told reporters Saturday. The operation proceeded with an eye toward preserving evidence, all of which will be sent to an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, Yacone said. Among the items seized from the apartment were a Batman poster, Batman mask and a computer, according to the law enforcement source. The shootings occurred during a screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Tales of heroism abound from tragedy . Hundreds of residents were evacuated from five buildings, including the modest, three-story brick building where Holmes told the police he had rigged his top-floor, one-bedroom apartment with explosives. All occupants except those who live in the suspect's building were allowed to return home Saturday night. Share your tribute to the victims on CNN iReport. CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Dax Shepard, who stars in the agreeably shaggy romance/chase movie/Tarantino knockoff ""Hit & Run,"" has a talent for playing sleazy-smart deceivers who have somehow held on to their innocence. In ""Hit & Run,"" which he wrote and codirected (with David Palmer), he plays a retired crook named Charlie Bronson (a fake name chosen when the character ditched L.A. to enter Witness Protection). Squirreled away in a pastoral small town, Charlie got involved with Annie (Kristen Bell), a college professor who adores him â€” but is also terrified by the fact that she knows next to nothing about him. Looking at Shepard, who has the lopsided grin of a happy-talk used-car salesman, offset by very serious eyes that perpetually study whomever he's babbling to, we know just how she feels. When Annie lands a job interview, Charlie agrees to drive her to L.A. in his souped-up, death-black 1967 Lincoln Continental, a road odyssey that lures out all the colorful underworld vermin who've been waiting for him to emerge from the woodwork. ""Hit & Run"" is filled with pop-up-book hooligans who can't stop talking: Bradley Cooper (underacting nicely) as a dreadlocked sociopath, Tom Arnold (overacting loudly) as a gay U.S. marshal so closeted he's about to explode. The dialogue veers into digressions about ADHD, the cruddiness of mainstream dog food, and much else.

"(CNN) -- South Korean president Lee Myung-bak apologized to his country for what he called ""shameful incidents"" involving his family and inner circle on Tuesday. Earlier this month, his older brother, Lee Sang-deuk was arrested on bribery charges involving two troubled Korean banks. This week, prosecutors in Korea sought arrest warrants for two former aides to Lee on the suspicion of receiving bribes from the same two banks, according to Yonhap, a South Korean news agency. Lee addressed the nation with a speech that was carried live. ""I came into the office with firm determination to bring a clean political climate,"" Lee said. ""I tried, by returning my entire fortune to the society and donating my salary. I was proud that I thought I brought in good results. But my heart collapsed and I cannot keep my head up after what happened to people so close to me."" ""This is all my fault,"" Lee said. His brother, Lee Sang-deuk is a former six-term lawmaker and has widely been considered the major force behind Lee's presidential election in 2007. Lee Sang-deuk has remained in a detention center since his arrest on July 11, over allegations he received about half a million dollars from the banks Solomon and Mirae in exchange for exerting influence over officials investigating the banks, according to a court official. The operations of those two banks were suspended in May for six months by authorities. In his address to the nation, Lee said he felt pain and regret over the scandals. ""I will receive any criticism as if it is sweet,"" he said. Lee is not running for re-election this year because South Korean presidents are limited to a single five-year term. But the recent scandals could affect his political party in the December elections. ""I express sincere apology to the people,"" Lee said. Lee's brother is not the first relative of a South Korean president to face criminal charges. Former President Roh Moo-hyun committed suicide in 2009 amid an investigation into a bribery scandal that had tarnished his reputation. His older brother was convicted and sentenced to prison. Former President Kim Dae-jung's three sons were also imprisoned for corruption by the end of his presidential term.","South Korean president Lee Myung-bak apologized for recent scandals .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- California officials said Tuesday they won't arbitrarily free 33,000 inmates and they will submit plans to the federal courts in two weeks specifying ways to remedy prison overcrowding under a U.S. Supreme Court order this week. ""The goal is not to release anybody early,"" said spokeswoman Terry Thornton of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ""Nobody wants to do that."" ""Nobody wants to open the door and let everyone out,"" she added. The state's plan to reduce prison overcrowding is still being prepared for a special federal three-judge panel, Thornton said. California's 33 adult prisons now hold 143,435 inmates, she said. Thornton said that state plan may or may not include ongoing state initiatives that are targeting the overcrowding issue, which the U.S. Supreme Court said in a 5-4 decision Monday fall ""below the standard of decency."" One such initiative is the so-called AB 109 law that Gov. Jerry Brown signed in April that will transfer low-level offenders from state prisons to county jails. But the ""public safety realignment"" plan doesn't have state funding yet, which could be stymied by how the state treasury deals with a staggering $25 billion budget deficit. ""We particularly need the support and cooperation of the legislature with the immediate funding and implementation of AB 109,"" California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Secretary Matthew Cate said in a statement. ""The governor has repeatedly called for full and constitutionally protected funding of this bill to allow certain offenders to serve their incarceration and parole term under local supervision."" In ongoing state remedies that may be submitted to the federal courts for approval, the state has already transferred 10,088 inmates to contracted out-of-state facilities  to reduce sleeping in gymnasiums, dayrooms and other places not intended for housing, according to the corrections department. In May 2007, the state authorized construction of the California Health Facility in Stockton, which will provide medical and mental health treatment with more than 1,722 beds for inmates, the corrections department said. More than 18,000 beds are planned to provide health care to thousands of other inmates, the agency said. These measures may also be sent to the federal court panel, Thornton said. On Monday, the Supreme Court affirmed a federal order telling California to reduce its overflowing prison population. The case was a classic battle over state versus federal authority, focusing on whether U.S. courts can step in and essentially run state prisons when officials have repeatedly violated basic constitutional guarantees afforded inmates. The issue came down to a sharply divided debate between public safety concerns and individual rights, a debate that goes into how the three branches of government should balance competing state interests. The swing vote was Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote of the ""continuing injury and harm resulting from these serious constitutional violations,"" including as many as 156,000 people crammed into correctional facilities designed to hold about half that many. He said that ""needless suffering and death have been the well-documented result. Over the whole course of years during which this litigation has been pending, no other remedies have been found to be sufficient."" In dissent, Justice Samuel Alito warned that any mass release of inmates to alleviate overcrowding would be ""gambling with the safety of the people of California."" The state now has a two-year window to comply, with the clock starting Monday. Officials have not fully explained how their ongoing inmate reduction plan will need to be modified to meet the federal order. In a statement issued Monday afternoon, California Gov. Jerry Brown said he would take ""all steps necessary to protect public safety"" in resolving the prison overcrowding crisis. Prison overcrowding is a nationwide problem, but California's dilemma is unique in its massive scope and time frame. There is general agreement that the prison conditions across California are disturbing. Prisoners are stacked three deep in 6-by-9-foot cells designed to hold only one. Open spaces meant to be gymnasiums and clinics have been transformed into crowded encampments with bunks and unsanitary conditions. Suicides occur once every eight days, on average. California has the nation's largest prison system, and the state says it has reduced the prison population to meet overcrowding concerns. But a special federal court panel had ordered 36,000 to 46,000 more inmates released or transferred quickly, about a quarter of the total. That figure has now been reduced to 33,000, achieved through ongoing state remedies to overcrowding, according to Thornton, the state prisons spokeswoman. Despite some recent drops, the prison population in the state has increased by about 75% in the past two decades. Two lawsuits -- one filed in 1990, the other in 2001 -- say overcrowding is the core cause of what has become a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. State legislators and corrections officials have admitted that the prisons violate the ban on ""cruel and unusual punishment"" contained in the Constitution, and have organized more than 20 panels and commissions to address the crisis. The special federal court in 2009 had ordered the state to shrink the prison population from the current 200% over capacity to a maximum of 137.5%, and to accomplish that in two years. The state was given wide latitude to meet the goal, but the court was adamant the state do it without delay and without excuse. The task was made more difficult by the state budget crisis and a national economic downturn that have created turmoil over funding solutions not just in prisons, but also in education, transportation and social programs.

"(CNN) -- A California-based hospital chain has agreed to pay $16.5 million to settle allegations that its hospitals were involved in a kickback scheme in which homeless people were taken to hospitals for sometimes unneeded treatment, and government programs were billed for the work, authorities said Thursday. Los Angeles Doctor's Hospital, Inc., agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud Medicare and Medi-Cal through the payment of illegal kickbacks to ""marketers"" who recruited people to act as patients, the U.S. attorney for central California said in a news release. LADH is a subsidiary of Pacific Health Corp., which has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with federal authorities. In the agreements filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, LADH and PCH admitted that from 2003 to 2008 they and the three PCH hospitals paid more than $2.3 million in kickbacks to ""marketers"" to recruit people to act as patients, the statement said. They were treated, even if they did not need treatment, the news release said. Some of the recruits were found in ""Skid Row"" in downtown Los Angeles, it said. ""As a result of this illegal conduct, Medicare and Medi-Cal made nearly $16 million in improper payments to the PHC hospitals,"" the statement added. According to the plea agreement of one of those ""marketers,"" Estill Mitts, hired ""stringers"" to recruit homeless people to act as patients from 2004 until 2007 in exchange for promises of small payments. He has previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to recruit homeless people to receive unnecessary health services, the release said. CNN was unable Thursday to reach Mitts, who is to be sentenced October 15 in federal court. Though PHC was criminally charged Thursday, the charges will be dismissed in 2018 if the company follows through with its agreement, the statement said. ""To root out and deter those who seek to exploit publicly funded health care programs, we need to pursue all available remedies -- civil, criminal, and administrative,"" said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr., in the news release. ""The guilty plea, civil settlement agreement, and corporate compliance agreement that we are announcing today ... reflect this approach and should remind unscrupulous health care providers of our determination to bring to justice those who exploit federal and state public health programs for their personal gain."" In the civil settlement, PHC; its parent company, Health Investment Corp.; and three subsidiary hospitals agreed to pay the $16.5 million to settle claims that they were involved in the scheme and submitted false claims to Medicare and Medi-Cal, the statement said. Parties to the civil settlement are: Los Angeles Metropolitan Medical Center, Newport Specialty Hospital (formerly known as Tustin Hospital and Medical Center) and Anaheim General Hospital. ""One of the key goals of our new management team has been to fairly resolve these legacy issues with the government,"" Pacific Health said in a statement. ""We are pleased that we will now be able to put these matters behind us and focus exclusively on our primary mission -- providing excellent and compassionate care to the communities we serve. We believe that ultimately our hospitals will be stronger as a result of this agreement. PHC's new leadership team reaffirms its unwavering commitment to ethical business practices and full compliance with the law."" The first installment on the $16.5 million fine, of more than $1 million, was made Wednesday, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Wendy Weiss in a telephone interview. The settlement, which was reached in June, stipulates that the second installment is due September 1, she said. ""We are trying to hit these providers that do these kinds of things hard with appropriate civil and criminal remedies so that we send a message that we are continuing to go after providers that defraud our federal health care programs in this way,"" said Weiss. ""Hospitals colluding with marketers to fatten profits through illegal referrals for costly and sometimes needless medical services are pocketing millions of taxpayer dollars,"" said Glenn R. Ferry, special agent in charge for the Los Angeles region of the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In a previous investigation, Intercare Health Systems Inc. (which had previously been called City of Angels Medical Center), and former owners Robert Bourseau and Dr. Rudra Sabaratnam, were the subjects of consent judgments related to a similar scheme. Bourseau, Sabaratnam and others were sentenced to federal prison for their involvement.","Pacific Health Corporation and three of its hospitals agree to the payment .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- James Holmes, the suspect in Friday's shooting of dozens of people at a Colorado movie theater, was a ""nice guy"" who worked well with children, said a man who worked with him at a summer camp four years ago. ""I would never have thought he would do something like that,"" said Gabriel Menchaca, who worked with Holmes at Camp Max Straus in the summer of 2008. ""He was a little isolated, but he was, you know, a nice guy,"" Menchaca told CNN's Soledad O'Brien on Monday. He couldn't believe it when he realized his former co-worker was the suspect in the shootings. ""Once I saw it was him, I was shocked. ... Something made him do a big change like that. I had no idea that later on he would be a murderer, a killer,"" Menchaca said. Holmes is due in court Monday, where he is likely to face charges of first-degree murder in connection with the shootings that left 12 dead and 58 injured. Holmes, a 24-year-old doctoral student in neuroscience, was arrested outside the Century 16 multiplex early Friday. He's accused of opening fire in the crowded theater during a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Holmes was not involved in any incidents at the summer camp, Menchaca said. Camp Max Straus caters to needy children ages 7 to 14, and is run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles, which confirmed his employment but would not offer further details or comment. ""It's a big responsibility to work in a camp like that, and he was living up to it. He was pretty good,"" said Menchaca, who did not stay in touch with Holmes after they worked together four years ago. Holmes applied to join a gun range in June, but the range's operator said Sunday that he was disturbed by the ""weird and bizarre"" message on Holmes' answering machine. ""It was weird,"" said Glenn Rotkovich, managing partner of the Lead Valley Range in Byers, Colorado. ""I didn't know what kind of message was left by this idiot. We need to know if he's an idiot before we let him have access to our range."" Rotkovich told CNN that Holmes sent in an online application on June 25. Rotkovich said he called the number Holmes left on the form, only to get a message he said was largely unintelligible. He said the voice was ""guttural, freakish, maybe drunk. Just weird and bizarre -- a deep, guttural, forced voice."" Paying tribute to the victims . Rotkovich said Holmes didn't call him back. He left another message, and said he was again disturbed by the voice on the machine. ""It bothered me so much I told my staff, 'If this guy shows up, he gets nothing until I meet him,' "" he said. He said he tried calling Holmes a third time, again with no response, then quit. Holmes never called back, nor did he come to the range in Byers, about 40 miles east of Denver. But when news broke Friday of the bloodbath in a theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Rotkovich said one of his staffers remembered the name and saw that it matched reports of the suspect in the killings. Shooting survivors recount Colorado horror . Pictures obtained of Holmes show a tall, bright-eyed, dark-haired young man, in contrast to the man a law enforcement official said had dyed his hair red and identified himself as ""The Joker"" after his arrest. And authorities recovered a Batman poster and mask from his apartment, a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation said Sunday. It's an image difficult to reconcile for those who know him as a clean-cut, quiet graduate student. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 on a scholarship and graduated with highest honors with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience in 2010. ""Academically, he was at the top of the top,"" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. UC Riverside police have no record of any contact with Holmes, the university said. Neither did police at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, where Holmes enrolled in 2011 as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, university officials said in a statement released Sunday. Holmes' sole brush with the law in Colorado appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from Aurora police. But there are indications that something may have been amiss in Holmes' life in recent months. He withdrew from the program in June, though ""he gave no reason for his withdrawal from the graduate school,"" said Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the University of Colorado. He received many deliveries over the past four months to his home and work addresses, which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the rampage and found in his booby-trapped apartment, Aurora Police Chief Paul Oates told reporters Saturday. Holmes purchased four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months, Oates said. Police: Evidence of 'calculation,' 'deliberation' in Colorado shooting . Police haven't disclosed any motive for the attack or explained Holmes' appearance at the time of his arrest, citing an ongoing investigation. Holmes was dressed in black, wearing a ballistic helmet, a tactical ballistic vest, protective leggings, a throat and groin protector, and a gas mask during the attack, police said, and witnesses say they did not see his face because of the mask. Unlike most people his age, Holmes does not appear to have a social media footprint -- no accounts with Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr, though authorities are investigating whether he posted a profile on the sex website Adult Friend Finder. The profile contains a picture of a man with fiery red hair, a law enforcement source said. Police believe it may be a picture of Holmes, said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The profile said it was created by a 24-year-old man from Aurora and has since been taken down. Adult Friend Finder said Sunday that it ""values the privacy of its members"" and would not confirm the identity of any users. The site will respond to police inquiries ""as may be required by law,"" company spokesman Lindsay Trivento said in a written statement. The man who grew up in the upscale northwest San Diego neighborhood of Rancho PeÃ±asquitos was renting an apartment in Aurora, according to police and realty records. Tom Mai, a neighbor of the Holmes family in San Diego, described Holmes as ""clean-cut, quiet, responsible."" At the time of his arrest, Holmes was living in a small, three-story brick building on Paris Street in Aurora, in Apartment 10, within walking distance of the university.

"(CNN) -- Within 24 hours, Joe Paterno's statue at Penn State University came down and his record as the winningest coach at the top level of college football disappeared. The steps by Penn State President Rodney Erickson and the National Collegiate Athletic Association drew sharply differing reactions Monday. They are the latest impact from a child sex-abuse scandal now linked forever to the university's storied football program. Paterno's family and diehard Penn State loyalists condemned the penalties as an overzealous response that unfairly targeted the former coach, who died of lung cancer in January after being fired the previous November to end his 46-year career at the university. 'Stark wake-up call' with $60 million fine for Penn State . ""The sanctions announced by the NCAA today defame the legacy and contributions of a great coach and educator without any input from our family or those who knew him best,"" said a statement by the Paterno family. The NCAA sanctions included a $60 million fine against Penn State, a four-year ban from bowl games and the loss of 20 football scholarships. Perhaps most painful to the Paterno family and his fans was the removal of 14 seasons of football victories, covering 1998-2011, which cost Paterno the record as winningest coach in Division 1 history. Why is NCAA taking sex abuse more seriously than the Catholic Church? ""In our minds and hearts, those victories are still there and they still count, which is what makes him a great coach,"" said Penn State graduate Ujas Patel, who heads the university's alumni association chapter in London. The sanctions came a day after the university removed the 900-pound bronze statue of Paterno from outside Beaver Stadium on the State College campus, saying it had become a symbol of division. The punishments follow an independent investigation, led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, of the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in late June of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims. Do sanctions alter history books on Penn State and Paterno's legacy? Freeh's report held four top Penn State officials, including Paterno, responsible for failing to stop the abuse. That failure began in 1998, according to the report. Paterno's family called the penalties premature and challenged the veracity of Freeh's investigation. ""How Sandusky was able to get away with his crimes for so long has yet to be fully understood, despite the claims and assertions of the Freeh report,"" said the Paterno family's statement. It also called the acceptance of the NCAA penalties by university officials and the board of trustees without a hearing ""an abdication of their responsibilities and a breach of their fiduciary duties to the university and the 500,000 alumni."" Former Penn State president: I was abused as a kid, wouldn't ignore Sandusky allegations . ""Punishing past, present and future students of the university because of Sandusky's crimes does not serve justice,"" the Paterno family's statement said. ""This is not a fair or thoughtful action; it is a panicked response to the public's understandable revulsion at what Sandusky did."" Others with strong ties to the Penn State community also condemned the NCAA sanctions. ""We expected large sanctions but this is overkill,"" said Daniel Byrd, president of the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the PSU Alumni Association, in a e-mail to CNN. Byrd praised some of the penalties, such as $60 million the university will give to groups helping victims of child sex abuse, but he argued that the cut in football scholarships and four-year ban from bowl games ""benefit nobody."" ""It hurts our student athletes that need grants,"" Byrd's e-mail said. Across the Atlantic, Patel said the penalties unfairly target the future of the football program that he described as vital to the university. Experts: What happens to Penn State football? ""I don't see the program recovering in the next 10 to 15 years,"" he told CNN by telephone, adding that ""by essentially taking away the main pillar of the university, you are almost pulling the university down."" On social media, some players wrote they would return next season as a team with a mission. ""PSU vs The World - Day 1 - ,"" tweeted tight end Garry Gilliam. Former players, meanwhile, rejected the 111 canceled victories by the NCAA that dropped Paterno's total from a record 409 to 298. ""They can take away whatever games they want to, I know I was apart of win 400, 409 and all the other games WE won while at PSU,"" posted former wide receiver Derek Moye on Twitter. Supporters of the tough sanctions sounded equally vehement, at least according to online comments to CNN. ""I don(')t think the defenders of Joe Paterno and Penn State here fully comprehend the barely imaginable severity of the CRIMES that were committed,"" wrote a reader with the online handle FlyingfFish. ""Not just crimes by Sandusky, but by nearly all of Penn State's football and academic leadership. This was (literally) institutional sanctioning of child rape for the continued benefit of the football team. I cannot think of anything lower or more despicable. Penn State is getting what they deserve."" Opinion: Was NCAA too quick to punish Penn State? Erickson and other top Penn State officials said they accept the NCAA penalties. ""With today's announcement and the action it requires of us, the university takes a significant step forward,"" Erickson said in a written statement, while Acting Athletic Director David Joyner added that the path ahead ""will not be easy, but it is necessary, just, and will bring a better future."" Byrd, who leads the oldest of the university's scores of alumni associations around the world, disagreed. ""Rodney Erickson and any one else who signed off on these sanctions should resign today,"" said Byrd's e-mail to CNN. While the university removed Paterno's statue from public view, the university library that bears his name will remain unchanged. To Patel, the university is trying to get rid of Paterno's football legacy while conserving his academic legacy. He complained of media coverage that focused solely on the Sandusky scandal and Paterno's failure to intervene while ignoring how Paterno required his players to succeed in the classroom as well as on the football field. ""Anybody who's gone to Penn State, that's something that really is going to bother"" them, he said. Patel, who completed six years at Penn State in 2008 with a graduate degree in aerospace engineering, said he has kept in touch with college friends by phone and e-mail ever since. The main topic is always the same -- Penn State football. ""Once you graduate,"" he explained, ""it ties back to the football program."" Sanctions: Who pays the price?

CNN's Susan Candiotti and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Joe Paterno's family says the NCAA penalties ""defame"" the coach's legacy .

"Washington (CNN) -- Three U.S. congressmen from California are calling for the Department of Agriculture to immediately reopen a slaughterhouse closed this week after videos showed what the agency called ""disturbing evidence of inhumane treatment of cattle."" The videos, shot by an undercover activist and posted online Tuesday by the organization Compassion Over Killing, show animals at the Hanford, California-based Central Valley Meat Co. being repeatedly shot with a bolt gun. Another is shown suffocated and others are seen hanging from a single hind leg while apparently still alive. ""While some of the footage provided from this facility shows unacceptable treatment of cattle, it does not show anything that would compromise food safety,"" a USDA statement sent to CNN by spokeswoman Alyn Kiel said. ""We are aggressively continuing our investigation."" Republican Reps. Devin Nunes, Jeff Denham and Kevin McCarthy wrote Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on Thursday to urge the reopening of the plant because its closure caused ""enormous economic stress in a community with double digit unemployment."" They called on the USDA to reopen the plant immediately and quickly deploy additional agency staff to make sure the slaughterhouse meets appropriate regulations. ""This area and these families cannot take this plant being closed,"" Nunes, who represents the district where many of the 500 slaughterhouse employees live, told CNN in an interview. ""This is going to devastate many families who are already on the brink."" In recent years, the area around Hanford, about 30 miles south of Fresno, has seen home values plummet and unemployment rates reach as high as 20%, according to Nunes. Brian Coelho, president of the Central Valley Meat Co., on Tuesday called the reports of inhumane treatment ""disturbing and surprising."" ""Our company seeks to not just meet federal humane handling regulations, but to exceed them,"" Coelho said in a statement. He said federal inspectors continuously inspect the plant and are able to take action if they see a problem. ""That is why these allegations are both disturbing and surprising,"" he said. The company has submitted a plan required for reopening the plant to the USDA, Nunes said, and he hopes the agency will approve it soon. ""USDA is reviewing the corrective action plan to ensure that it would comply with humane handling regulations before the facility is allowed to resume operations,"" agency spokesman Dirk Fillpot told CNN in a statement. When asked for his reaction to the images in the videos, Nunes replied: ""It's a tough business. Killing animals is not an easy business. The key point here is to make sure that everything is investigated and if any laws were broken."" In the letter, the congressmen also note the USDA had inspectors at the plant during the time the video was shot, yet ""despite their active presence through out the facility at the time there is no record of non-compliance."" Central Valley Meat, a 50-year-old company, was one of the beef suppliers for In-N-Out Burger, a well-known fast food chain predominantly in California and the Southwest. Mark Taylor, chief operating officer for In-N-Out, said Wednesday that the chain has stopped doing business with Central Valley Meat. ""In-N-Out Burger would never condone the inhumane treatment of animals, and all of our suppliers must agree to abide by our strict standards for the humane treatment of cattle,"" he said in a statement.","The slaughterhouse was closed after videos surfaced showing inhumane treatment of cattle .
The closure is causing ""enormous economic stress"" to the community, congressmen say .
The USDA is reviewing a corrective plan submitted by the company ."
"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama's campaign announced plans for a full-court press while Republicans hold their convention in Tampa, Florida, this week, some veteran political watchers marked the end of an era. After all, as much as there has ever been accepted ""rules"" of presidential politics, it was once a given that the opposing candidate ceded the convention week to his rival -- it was the polite thing to do. Instead, the Obama campaign is doing anything but. Not only will surrogates for the president blanket Tampa and key battleground regions, but the campaign's three key figures will also be doing their best to steal some of Mitt Romney's orchestrated thunder this week. Liberal group airs ad in Tampa . On Tuesday, the day Ann Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are scheduled to address the convention in prime time, Obama will kick off a two-day, three-state tour of swing states that include stops at college towns in Iowa, Colorado, and Virginia. The Obama campaign strategy: contrast the expectedly older demographic that historically is represented among Republican convention attendees with images of the president rallying thousands of enthusiastic young people. Meanwhile, first lady Michelle Obama will appear on ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" on Wednesday, the same day vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan is set to make his big speech. The Obama campaign also planned to dispatch Vice President Joe Biden to Tampa itself on Monday but scrapped the trip on Friday because it said it was concerned that a vice presidential visit would stress law enforcement resources already stretched thin by Tropical Storm Isaac. On Saturday, the campaign canceled Biden's Tuesday events in Orlando and St. Augustine. The Romney campaign says it has similar plans to ""bracket"" the Democratic convention next week in Charlotte, North Carolina, though the exact campaign schedules of Ryan and Romney have yet to be released. Still, many Democrats are expecting at least Ryan will show up near Charlotte's Time Warner Cable Arena as Democratic delegates get set to officially re-nominate Obama to the Democratic presidential ticket. A look at Janna Ryan: 'She's going to bloom where she's planted' To be sure, 2012 marks an emphatic end to the bygone courtesy of allowing the other campaign to have its convention moment. But the traditional nicety began unraveling at least two or three election cycles ago. It was then that party officials decided it was advantageous to hold conventions much later in the summer, when voters were off the beach, sending their kids back to school, and at last starting to tune into the presidential race en masse. It may have been relatively harmless for a candidate to lay low for a week in July, but late August or early September? Forget about it. For example, then-Democratic candidate Al Gore decided to take a vacation on picture-perfect Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, when Republicans convened in Philadelphia in late July of 2000. The George W. Bush campaign largely returned the favor two weeks later when Democrats convened in Los Angeles. Both campaigns reasoned most Americans still weren't tuning in to the day-day machinations of the race as the dog days of summer continued. Four years later, Bush remained secluded on his ranch while Democrats nominated Sen. John Kerry in Boston in July. But with GOP's decision to hold their convention more than a month later in early September, coupled with a more fervent news cycle than ever before, the Kerry campaign decided it would not extend the same courtesy. The Democratic presidential nominee was dispatched to Tennessee and Ohio for speeches that week while his running mate, then-Sen. John Edwards, held court in North Carolina and West Virginia. Candy Explains: Political Conventions . Miffed that Republicans held their convention so late in 2004, Democrats followed suit four years later. That meant both conventions fell in successive weeks at the very end of the summer of 2008 and, by extension, both candidates remained on the trail while the rival party crowned its nominee. Then-Republican candidate John McCain attended two events in his home state of Arizona while Democrats convened in Denver, Colorado. The next week, then-Democratic nominee Obama barnstormed at seven rallies across three states as McCain got set to accept his party's nomination in St. Paul, Minnesota. What was once polite has fallen victim to expediency. As fall approaches and the now-fractured and partisan media climate demands a response to every barb from the other side, it would be nothing short of political malfeasance to allow a candidate to cede the klieg lights entirely. By the numbers: Tampa, Florida . CNN's Brianna Keilar, Becky Brittain, and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report .","Candidates in the past laid low while other party was having its convention .
Both Obama and Romney will campaign during other party's big week .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Hidden in the alleyways behind Jakarta's fancy malls and in between the high-rise apartment buildings is what Ronny Poluan, a former film maker, calls the ""real Jakarta."" Ronny Poluan (in cap), who runs ""Jakarta Hidden Tours,"" takes a group through a Jakarta slum. It is not far from the glitz and glam that dominates the capital's skyline, yet it is a side of the city that few foreigners ever see. ""I want them to (have an) authentic view,"" Poluan, who runs ""Jakarta Hidden Tours,"" said as he took a group of Australians through the winding maze of a central Jakarta slum. ""I'm running out of rice,"" an old lady mumbles in the doorway of her tiny dark home as the group passes by. Further along, little girls push their faces into wire fencing, while another group of children draw 36-year-old Daniel Knott into a game of cards. Knott, a volunteer for various NGOs, and his wife, who works for AUSAID, live in Jakarta and have been to the slums before. But it is the first time their friends, Kerri Bell and her husband Phil Paschke, have been to Indonesia. Knott said he felt it was important to bring the visiting couple here. ""I think Jakarta is a city of contrasts,"" he said. ""There's a lot of shopping malls and kitschy stuff, but it's also a lot of normal people. And, it's fun to come and hang out with the locals, actually."" ""It's fantastic,"" Kerri Bell said. ""I've been in Asia once before and we didn't want to just gloss over the surface and see all the things you can see in a western country. It feels to me much more like the real Jakarta, to see what drives it. To see that is so much more valuable than coming and lying on the beach."" The tour first took them into a couple of cramped and sweltering soy bean cake and tofu factories --- both staples in the Indonesian diet.  Watch Arwa Damon tour through the slum » . The group remarked that there were few other cities where foreigners can wander around the slums, and not just feel safe but welcomed -- and that is what Poluan said these tours were all about. ""I want to see people meet people,"" he said. ""The other culture meet the other culture."" ""It's a pretty big eye opener,"" Paschke said. ""It's the first time I have left Australia, so yes, it's completely different."" Poluan ushered the group into a covered market where you can find just about anything. For the group, it was a bombardment of the senses. ""I love seeing them,"" fish seller Rokayah said, laughing. ""They are handsome and they are rich. It is rare for me to see foreigners here at the traditional market, and I like talking to them, but I don't understand English."" The tour costs around $34 per person. Poluan keeps about half of the money for himself and his NGO, INTERKULTUR. The other half goes to the community. Critics, however, said that this type of direct cash aid was counter-productive. They said the tours were demeaning, exploited the poor, and taught them to be dependent on the handouts of others. ""These poor people, we have to educate them,"" said Wardah Hafidz, coordinator of the Urban Poor Consortium. ""We have to tell them that it's not God's will that they are poor, that they also have to fight for themselves. They can't depend on other people forever."" This type of criticism angers and frustrates Poluan, who said his tours were about raising awareness on both sides. In the last month, he has also started a microfinance scheme. More importantly though, he said, were the initiatives that he hoped his tours would jumpstart. ""They (the foreigners) usually think about how to help, to educate,"" he said. ""They come back again, bring books. I try to make a pushcart library for the children."" He said his tours were also about educating foreigners on real issues facing the country. The group weaved its way to the city's train tracks, only barely visible amid the garbage and squalor. It is the site of a constant battle between the track dwellers and the government, which says that living there is illegal and dangerous. Government evictions and the destruction of the feeble structures, usually just bits of plastic tarp and wood, are fairly commonplace. ""I am used to it,"" shrugged 80-year-old Indarjo. He has lived like this for five decades, making his living as a scavenger. He said he has been forced to move over 200 times. He invited the group into his home, and explained that when it rains, he just pulls the flap over. ""I feel that I am equal to them. I treat them as my guests,"" he said. ""I believe that they would do the same for me."" The visitors were dumbstruck, the impact of what they were seeing, they say, was hard to put into words. It was a sobering but educational look at Indonesia, where some 40 million people live below the poverty line. ""It's pretty confronting,"" Paschke said. ""The things you complain about at home don't seem too significant."" ""It's hard to see something like this and just go home to normal life,"" his wife, Bell, added as the couple stood in the middle of the tracks. ""It makes me motivated to look at the local community and things that we can help out with at home.""","Ronny Poluan leads tours of a Jakarta slum to show visitors the 'real' capital .

"(CNN) -- Now the party is really starting. Democrats and Republicans are preparing to gather to hold their conventions, each using this precious time to tell the nation what its presidential candidate is all about. Republicans are hoping that Gov. Chris Christie can tear down the Democrats, New Jersey style, in his keynote address, and that Condoleezza Rice can add some foreign policy heft to a ticket remarkably thin on international affairs. Democrats are depending on former President Bill Clinton to tap into the rhetoric he used against Republicans in the budget battles of 1995 to cut into Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's vision for Medicare. They hope that San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, the keynote speaker, can send a message to Latinos about which party is on their side. Without any more deal-making in smoke-filled rooms, speeches are the highlight of the convention. Even when speeches are made at conventions whose candidate winds up losing, they can offer ideas and rhetoric that become integral to the party for decades to come. A look back at history reveals that there are different types of speeches that we might see in the coming weeks, each with very different purposes and effect. Ideological Agenda-Setters: There are some speeches that are notable because they lay out a set of principles for the party to embrace in the coming election and thereafter. As opposed to focusing on the particularities of a specific campaign, these speeches put forth ideas that shape the next generation of candidates. In 1948, the Minnesota candidate for senator, Hubert Humphrey, delivered a thunderous address in which he called on Southern Democrats to embrace the cause of civil rights or leave the party. ""To those who say that this civil rights program is an infringement of states' rights,"" Humphrey said, ""I say this: The time has arrived for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights."" The speech put the party on the side of racial liberalism and accelerated the path toward the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The same year that Congress passed the civil rights legislation, Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater gave his most famous address, when he told Republicans to embrace conservatism and avoid the lure of centrism. He ardently defended a right-wing agenda. Even though Goldwater lost the presidential election, the speech signaled the future of the party. In 1980, Sen. Ted Kennedy, who lost the nomination to President Jimmy Carter, energized delegates by talking about the party's traditions and defense of the common man. ""Our commitment has been, since the days of Andrew Jackson, to all those he called 'the humble members of society -- the farmers, mechanics, and laborers.' On this foundation we have defined our values, refined our policies, and refreshed our faith."" He warned against the creeping conservatism of the Carter administration and reminded the Democrats to stay true to their core values. His rhetoric continues to offer inspiration for Democrats to this day. Opposition Attacks: Other speeches are effective primarily because they eviscerate the opposition, defining candidates, and defining parties, in ways that stick. When Franklin Roosevelt accepted the Democratic nomination in 1932, he introduced Americans to his vision of a New Deal -- a program of government assistance that would include help to farmers, workers and small business owners. FDR pushed back against the economic orthodoxies of the time, telling delegates, ""Our Republican leaders tell us economic laws --sacred, inviolable, unchangeable -- cause panics which no one could prevent. But while they prate of economic laws, men and women are starving."" In 1984, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo offered a powerful challenge to President Reagan's argument that it was ""morning in America"" again, and that the country was a ""shining city on a hill."" Cuomo distinguished between an economic recovery that benefited the wealthy and one that affected all Americans. ""There is despair, Mr. President,"" Cuomo said, ""in the facts that you don't see, in the places that you don't visit in your shining city."" Cuomo's speech became a powerful narrative for talking about the impact of Republican economic policies. That same year, Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., ripped into the foreign policy of ""San Francisco Democrats,"" castigating her former party, charging, ""They always blame America first."" Inspirational: Sometimes speeches are able to inspire delegates. In 1960, John F. Kennedy said that ""We stand today on the edge of a New Frontier -- the frontier of the 1960s, the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils, the frontier of unfilled hopes and unfilled threats. ... Beyond that frontier are uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered problems of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus."" For many Americans, this speech was the moment they fell in love with the charismatic senator and started to believe that he could help the country to do great things . The Star is Born: Convention speeches can put politicians on the map. In 1976, Ronald Reagan won the hearts of Republicans, even if he didn't win enough of their votes to become the party's presidential nominee that year. In unplanned remarks, he spoke to them about the need to stand firm against communism so that the country would protect the world from nuclear destruction. At the Democratic convention in 1976, African-American Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas introduced herself and a new generation of African-American politicians. In 2004, Sen. Barack Obama's powerful oratory at the Boston convention, about the need to unify the nation, propelled him onto the national stage. Coalitional: Like the rest of the campaign, a convention speech can help bring broad coalitions together, outlining points of commonality amid significant difference. In 1980, Ronald Reagan displayed his formidable skills with an acceptance speech that reached out to the conservative base, fiscal conservatives, neoconservative hawks, and centrist voters all in one swoop. The Flop: Sometimes speeches are so bad they are good. When candidates deliver really poor speeches, they can attract considerable attention and, occasionally, they don't end up sidetracking their careers. In 1988, the rising star Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton delivered a long-winded speech that ended with delegates cheering when he finally said ""in conclusion."" Although he would later improve his style, going on to win the presidency, the failure of the speech actually gave him even more of the national spotlight. These are some of the kinds of speeches that we might see in the coming weeks. Each has a very different value and, other than the flop, each can be helpful in energizing the party for the battle that is ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Speeches are the highlight of each party's political convention, says Julian Zelizer .
Some speeches put forth ideas that shape the next generation of candidates, he says .
Others eviscerate the opposition, permanently defining candidates and parties, he says .
Zelizer: Some speeches inspire, others make instant stars, and others flop resoundingly ."
"(CNN) -- Robin Van Persie played in a Manchester United shirt for the first time, but he could not stop his new club falling to an opening day defeat at Everton. Marouane Fellaini powered home a near-post header in the 57th minute to ensure a 1-0 victory for the Merseyside team and an early blow for Alex Ferguson's desire to wrestle back the English Premier League trophy from neighbors Manchester City. And Everton's victory was no piece of luck. It was carved out by a gritty, determined side who tried for every opportunity and won plaudits after the game for defending the lead. Fellaini had nearly opened the scoring just seven minutes before, when he fired wide. But the second time there was no doubt and he found a gap through the defenders to get it into the center of the net. Whilst Everton seemed to be tiring, they still held their own when Manchester United attacks came. New signing Shinji Kagawa was sending in a couple of balls for the likes of Wayne Rooney to work with, but nothing came of them. Van Persie started the game from the substitutes' bench, but Ferguson decided to bring on his new striker in the 68th minute as a replacement for Danny Welbeck, who was seemingly running out of ideas to break through a resolute Everton defense. The former Arsenal player did not waste any time in trying to make a mark on his new team. Within a minute of coming on, last season's EPL top scorer whipped in a corner kick which required an alert Everton back line to sweep clear. But after that, Everton sat back and frustrated Manchester United's attempts to try and get chances to the new signing. And the Goodison Park crowd were happy to see them do it . The English Premier League was not the only league to see a shock result on Monday. In Spain, newly-promoted Deportivo La Coruna sent out a strong message on their return to La Liga by beating last season's seventh-placed club Osasuna 2-0. Two loan players ensured the victory against Los Rojillos. Colombian midfielder Abel Aguilar, who normally plays for Hercules, struck in the 53rd minute of the game and the second came two minutes into time added on from Portugal striker Nelson Oliveira, who is on loan from Benfica. Rayo Vallecano left it late before beating Granada 1-0, with midfielder Roberto Trashorras scoring five minutes into added time. In Germany, Bayern Munich made light work of their DFB Cup first round opponents, beating SSV Jahn Regensburg 4-0 in a Bavarian derby. The side, who were recently promoted to the second tier of German football, managed to hold out for 32 minutes before Bayern broke the deadlock through new signing Mario Mandzukic. Young prospect Xherdan Shaqiri replaced Franck Ribery just after halftime and scored the second a quarter of an hour after the restart. Bayern then hit Regensburg with the final two goals 10 minutes before time when Croatia striker Mandzukic got his second and the man who replaced him, veteran Peru international Claudio Pizarro, scored number four in the 88th minute to mark the start of his second spell in Munich.","Everton shock title hopefuls by beating Alex Ferguson's side 1-0 in their opening game .

"London (CNN) -- These will be the green Games, to many they will be the austerity Games -- and they may even be the rain Games. The long wait will be over Friday for London, the city that was awarded the Games of the 30th Olympiad in 2005 on a promise of transformation. A day after that announcement, suicide bombers struck London trains and buses, killing 52 people. Seven years on and a security staffing fiasco has again thrust potential threats to the forefront of people's minds -- but Olympic organizers and the government say they will do everything possible to keep the Games safe. While Britain's wettest June in more than a century may have cast a cloud over the final preparations for the Games, forecasters say the weather is now set to brighten. And as more than 10,000 athletes from 205 countries assemble in London for Friday's opening ceremony, there is the promise of two weeks of breathtaking sport. Can Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, star of the Beijing track in 2008, win gold once again in the men's 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay events, thus cementing his status as the fastest man on the planet? Read why all the top sprinters come from Jamaica . Many wonder if Team USA men's basketball squad can surpass the on-court magic of the legendary Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Games. And as swimmers race beneath the sweeping curves of the Aquatics Center, the pressure will be on American Michael Phelps to replicate his success in the last Olympics, when he took home a record-breaking eight golds. Meanwhile the host nation's best hopes of gold medals may lie with Team GB's stars in sailing, rowing and cycling, including Bradley Wiggins, buoyed by an outstanding performance in the Tour de France cycle race. Every country will have at least one female athlete after Saudi Arabia included two women in its team for the first time, setting an important precedent for women's rights. Other athletes have survived the turmoil of the Arab Spring to represent their countries for the first time free from the tyranny of dictatorship. Read how Olympic athletes rose from the turmoil of the Arab Spring . And with medals to be handed out in 26 different sports, there's always the chance of a shock upset or the emergence of a shining new talent to captivate the crowds. Much of the drama will play out within the landscaped contours of the Olympic Park, intended as an enduring sporting legacy in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods and touted by the London 2012 organizers as the most sustainable space yet designed for the Games. The 80,000-capacity Olympic Stadium is built from only a tenth of the total steel used for the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing in 2008, while in the velodrome cyclists will race round a track made from sustainably-sourced Siberian pine. The organizers are keen to make sure the ""green"" theme continues beyond the Games' conclusion on August 12. Following a clean-up of the River Lea and canals that pass through the site, wildlife is being encouraged to return to wetlands downstream. Some 300,000 wetland plants have been planted, as well as more than 4,000 trees and 130,000 plants and bulbs in 250 acres of regenerated parkland. David Stubbs, head of sustainability for the London organizing committee, LOCOG, said the event would be a golden opportunity to show what can be achieved. ""If you can put sustainability at the heart of a project which is the largest logistical exercise in peace time -- across 26 different sports, with thousands of people attending and millions watching -- then you can do it anywhere,"" Stubbs told CNN. Much of the cost of staging the Olympic and Paralympic Games has been met by the taxpayer, with the government overseeing Â£9.3 billion ($14.5 billion) of spending from the public purse. According to its figures, three-quarters of the money spent by the Olympic Delivery Authority -- the public sector body responsible for building the new venues and infrastructure -- has been invested in long-term regeneration, and the Games are currently under budget by some Â£476 million. The organizing group LOCOG, which is a private company, has a core budget of more than Â£2 billion ($3.1 billion), with almost all revenue raised from the private sector, it says. By contrast, the Beijing Olympics in 2008 cost a whopping $40 billion, according to a December 2008 report by the state-run news agency Xinhua. China spent heavily on infrastructure, including three new subway lines, a new airport terminal and new sports facilities, the news agency said. Watch how the Olympic spirit is still strong in Beijing . London's Games come in the wake of the global financial meltdown and against a backdrop of economic gloom in Europe and broad cuts to public spending in Britain. But many will put aside such worries on Friday night, when crowds flock to the Olympic Stadium for the much-anticipated opening ceremony, dubbed ""Isles of Wonder"" and inspired by Shakespeare's play ""The Tempest."" In the event the heavens don't open on the night, director Danny Boyle, the Oscar-winning director of ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" has lined up fake clouds to shade his stage set of rolling British countryside, a pastoral vision that will include real farmyard animals -- not least 70 sheep with three sheepdogs to keep them in check. Olympic organizers predict more than a billion people worldwide will tune in to watch the spectacle on TV. Another side to London will come into view with the beach volleyball, to be played against the backdrop of the historic Horse Guards Parade, and the tennis at the All England Lawn Tennis club, home of the venerable Wimbledon Championships. How are you celebrating the Olympics? Send iReport your stories, video . But while London, a bustling city of more than 8 million people, is front and center of the 2012 Games, it is not alone in hosting what will be Britain's third Olympics, after previous occasions in 1908 and 1948. Eton Dorney in Buckinghamshire, just outside the capital, is the lake where rowers will push the boundaries of pain as they seek to bring home the gold. The testing waters of Weymouth Bay, on the Dorset coast, will be alive with the brightly-colored sails of yachts, dinghies and windsurfers. Sites in Hertfordshire and Essex, also near London, will host canoeing and mountain biking, and Olympic football matches will be played at grounds as far afield as Hampden Park in Glasgow and the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, before the final at the iconic Wembley Stadium in London. The challenges of policing such a high-profile and sprawling event, which follows on the heels of Queen Elizabeth II's rain-lashed Diamond Jubilee celebrations and precedes the Paralympic Games, are significant. A chorus of leading figures, from Home Secretary Theresa May to LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe, have stepped up to reassure visitors that a shortfall in recruiting security guards by contractor G4S will not impact on safety. The sight of thousands of soldiers deployed on the streets of London and elsewhere to support the security effort will be unusual but, organizers likely hope, reassuring to those at Olympic venues and transport hubs. London's Metropolitan Police Service, known as the Met, is undertaking what it says is its biggest-ever peacetime operation, running for 66 days over 1,000 venues, including sporting and cultural events, and making use of up to 9,500 police officers on the busiest days. Read how London faces security questions ahead of the Olympics . Away from the venues, the Met will also have to provide the usual policing for the city and its visitors. Few Londoners will forget that the Games come just a year after the capital was rocked by outbreaks of rioting and looting. At the same time, those athletes for whom London is home, such as runners Mo Farah and Christine Ohuruogu, will surely draw a special inspiration from the support of their crowded, diverse city. The Olympic torch, which arrived in London a week ahead of the Games, is being carried through the city's streets by almost 1,000 people on the last leg of its 8,000 mile, 70-day journey to the opening ceremony. When the last torchbearer carries the flame into the Olympic stadium on Friday, millions of eyes around the world will watch as the cauldron is lit -- a symbol of the hopes and sporting passions that will play out over the next 16 days. And while not everyone in Britain is overjoyed about the Olympics -- some Londoners seeing it as an inconvenience, others as an expensive luxury at a time of austerity -- surely there will be few who won't cross their fingers for no rain on that parade.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Security camera video obtained by CNN shows the tension between Jackson family members amid a very public dispute over the whereabouts of Katherine Jackson. The 82-year-old matriarch of the Jackson music dynasty has not contacted Michael Jackson's three children since she left the home she shares with them on July 15, although a sheriff's investigation concluded she is safe in Arizona. Siblings Janet, Jermaine and Randy Jackson attempted to convince Michael Jackson's two oldest children to leave Katherine Jackson's home with them Monday, but Paris and Prince resisted, three sources with knowledge of the incident said. The sources asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The Jackson strife: Family bickers over whereabouts of Michael's mom . The video shows Janet Jackson apparently trying to take a cell phone away from Paris Jackson at the Calabasas, California, home. She scolded her niece for using her phone to write about family issues on Twitter, according to the three sources. Paris, Michael Jackson's 14-year-old daughter, posted a Twitter message at about the same time: ""gotta love fam."" Prince, 15, is seen walking away from his Uncle Randy into the home's security office. Paris soon followed. Randy and Janet Jackson appeared to be recording the incident with their cell phones. Sheriff deputies broke up a scuffle minutes later involving Randy and Jermaine Jackson and their cousin Trent Jackson, who works for their mother, according to several people who witnessed it. No one was arrested, although a battery report was taken and an investigation is ongoing, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The drama happened as Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives closed a missing persons case opened for Katherine Jackson, who was found to be with her daughter Rebbie in Arizona. ""Katherine Jackson has been located and she is fine and with family,"" Whitmore said. ""Our missing persons case is closed."" Deputies talked to two family members and were satisfied, he explained. A lawyer for Katherine Jackson, however, was not satisfied, saying the sheriff's deputies who tried to talk to her in Arizona Monday were blocked from seeing her. Because she was taken across state lines, Katherine Jackson attorney Sandra Ribera said she hopes the FBI will investigate. Jermaine Jackson, in a statement posted on Twitter Sunday night, said his mother ""is safe and well in Arizona with her daughter and our sister, Rebbie, resting up on doctor's advice."" But Michael Jackson's three children still have not heard from their grandmother, eight days after she left them at home, Ribera said. ""8 days and counting . something is really off , this isn't like her at all .. i wanna talk directly to my grandmother!!<|3"" Paris tweeted Monday. Jermaine Jackson's statement insisted the children were not ""being 'blocked' from speaking with Mother."" ""She is merely an 82-year-old woman following doctor's orders to rest up and de-stress, away from phones and computers,"" he tweeted. His statement did not explain why Paris was rebuffed during several attempts to reach her grandmother on the phone.

"(CNN) -- On his website, Ronald William Brown posed with puppets, boasted about birthday party performances and offered workshops for school groups. Now the 57-year-old Florida man is behind bars, facing federal charges of conspiring to kidnap a child and possessing child pornography. Authorities accuse the puppeteer of having graphic discussions online about abusing, kidnapping, killing and eating children, according to court documents. He was arrested in Largo, Florida, last week and appeared in federal court Tuesday. Connecticut priest charged with possession of child porn . A 29-page criminal complaint filed in federal court includes transcripts of several online chats and details of what investigators found when they searched Brown's home. A CD found in his bedroom dresser's sock drawer included child pornography, images of what appear to be deceased children and a missing-child flier, according to the complaint. Brown told investigators he had discussed kidnapping, killing and eating a boy from his church but said ""it was just a fantasy and he could never and would never hurt anyone,"" the complaint said. Alleged Ukranian child porn pusher in custody . Brown maintains he is innocent, attorney Eric Kuske told reporters Tuesday. ""It's his contention right now that he didn't do this, he's not involved with this. That there's been some presumptions and assumptions made on what transpired. ... He wouldn't do something like this. He's got no criminal record,"" Kuske said, according to CNN affiliate WFLA. During a 1998 traffic stop, a sheriff's deputy spotted boys' underwear between front seats in the vehicle Brown was driving, according to records from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. Brown told the deputy he used the boys' underwear for puppet shows, ""dressing puppets in underwear,"" an incident report said. Brown told investigators that he helps out in the children's area of his church, and that a group of children from his neighborhood come to his house every Wednesday for pizza before he gives them a ride in a church van, the complaint said. Brown ""would never associate or speak to any adults"" in the mobile home park where he lived, resident Laura Jane Schate told CNN affiliate Bay News 9. But children were eager to talk with Brown, neighbors said. ""They'd come with their bikes and their skateboards, and they'd hang out, waiting for him to come home,"" neighbor Stacy Gaughan told CNN affiliate WFTS. Many in the neighborhood, disgusted by reports of what investigators allegedly uncovered, are ""wondering whether he did this here,"" she told CNN affiliate Bay News 9. A Facebook page that appears to belong to Brown says he ""usually (performs) weekly in schools, malls, civic clubs, birthday parties, and museums."" One post talks of mentoring a young boy. Another describes work on a Christian television puppet show.

"(CNN) -- The French Navy said they seized 11 pirates Sunday after they apparently mistook a French military vessel for a commercial ship and made a run at it. A French navy sailor speaks to one of 11 pirates on board the French warship the Nivose after their capture. Two pirate assault boats approached the Nivose ""at great speed,"" Capt. Christophe Prazuck said, but a French helicopter intervened before the attackers had time to fire at the French navy ship. The helicopter fired warning shots, he said. The pirates, who had a mother ship as well as the two assault boats, are being held for questioning on the Nivose, Prazuck said. The vessels were carrying AK-47 rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, but the pirates did not fire, he said. The incident took place about 1,000 km (620 miles) east of Mombasa, Kenya, at 8:30 a.m. local time (0430 GMT) he added. In the past three weeks, the Nivose has intercepted 24 suspected pirates as part of a European Union anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia, which has become a piracy hotspot. Over the past year, more than 100 suspected pirates have been picked up, Prazuck said. Of that total, 27 have been released, and more than 70 taken to jail in France, handed to authorities in Somalia or taken to Kenya under an EU agreement with the government in Nairobi. The Nivose seized three other suspected pirates Thursday morning, the French military spokesman said, but released them the next day for lack of evidence. But a day later, the Seychelles coast guard picked up the same three men. They claimed they were fishermen, but had no license to fish in the Seychelles exclusive economic zone, Prazuck said. Pirates seized a ship that was carrying wheat and used vehicles to Mogadishu, Somalia, on Saturday, according to NATO, which also patrols the area. The ship, the Almezaan, now appears to be heading for a Somali village called Harradera, known as a pirate base, Cmdr. Chris Davies told CNN. The ship did not send a distress signal until 4 a.m. Sunday, 18 hours after it was hijacked in the Indian Ocean, he said. No NATO ships were in the area at the time, he added. The Panamanian-flagged ship had a crew of 18 Indians as of April 2008, the last listing for it on the Web site of the International Transport Workers' Federation. Pirates also hijacked a British-owned bulk carrier in the Indian Ocean. The MV Ariana was carrying 35,000 tons of soya about 250 nautical miles (287 miles) northwest of the Seychelles when it was seized around dawn. The crew members are Ukrainians and they are not believed to be harmed, NATO said. It is unclear how many crew members were aboard the vessel and how it came to be attacked. NATO said it was unaware of ransom demands or any threats against those aboard. NATO said a European Union Protection Aircraft has been deployed to monitor and track the MV Ariana, which is making its way toward Somalia -- the epicenter of the pirate industry. Piracy has been soaring off the coast of eastern Africa -- particularly Somalia, which has not had an effective government since 1991. Somali pirates have defied foreign navies patrolling the waters and have collected large ransoms from shipping companies. Ransoms started out in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Journalist Ashleigh Nghiem contributed to this report.","French navy seizes 11 pirates after they threaten navy vessel .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in the Los Angeles suburb of Anaheim, California, have asked for a federal investigation into a pair of weekend police shootings that have sparked days of protests, the city's mayor said Wednesday. Police Chief John Welter said officers made 24 arrests after a protest that began at a City Council meeting Tuesday night turned violent, with demonstrators breaking windows and throwing rocks and bottles at police. Police responded with batons and nonlethal ""bean-bag"" and pepper spray projectiles, he said. Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait told reporters Wednesday that he asked the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles to investigate the fatal shootings of two men by police, but said violent protests ""will simply not be tolerated in our city."" ""When the investigations are concluded, we will have a clear and complete understanding of these incidents,"" Tait said. ""At that time, we will have additional public dialogue about any actions that need to be taken. ... We will not, however, accept any violent protests, vandalism or arson perpetrated under the guise of public protest."" The family of the first man killed, 25-year-old Manuel Diaz, filed a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit against the city and Police Department Tuesday seeking $50 million in damages. The suit, filed in state court, says police shot the unarmed Diaz in the back and that when he fell, they shot him in the head and killed him. Welter said there were more than 1,000 protesters Tuesday night, about two-thirds of whom were not from Anaheim -- but 20 of the 24 people arrested were local. ""Our job is to protect property and life. Our job isn't to stand back in the back and let anarchists or rioters damage property and injure people,"" he said. ""And if we don't do that, you'll be the first one criticizing me for where were the police, how come they weren't out there protecting property and people."" Those arrested face charges ranging from failure to disperse to assault with a deadly weapon. One man was found with a handgun, Welter said. Tuesday night's demonstration began with protests outside the City Council's meeting at the Anaheim City Hall, less than a mile and a half north of Disneyland, the city's most famous tourist attraction. Demonstrators disrupted the meeting and blocked access to the building, forcing a delay in the session as police moved to clear emergency exits, Welter said. The protest moved to downtown streets, where demonstrators blocked a major intersection and refused to move, Welter said. ""After allowing the crowd to protest for a couple of hours, the violence escalated to the point where an unlawful assembly was declared and the streets were then cleared of protesters,"" he said. Anaheim Police Sgt. Bob Dunn told CNN's ""Newsroom"" that once the protest was broken up, ""the crowds kind of moved around, sometimes fighting between each other, breaking windows and lighting fires and trash cans."" It was Saturday afternoon's fatal shooting of Diaz, whom police described as a gang member, that sparked the protests, CNN affiliate KCAL reported. Cell phone video taken at the scene and posted to YouTube showed residents confronting police officers as they ordered bystanders to back away from the man lying face down on a lawn before they cordoned off the area with yellow police tape. Dozens of people surrounded the police officers; some threw objects at them and rolled a burning trash bin in their direction, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. Police responded with rubber bullets and pepper spray. One demonstrator showed the television news station bruises she said she got from rubber bullets fired at the crowd. At one point, police lost control of a dog that attacked and bit at least one person. Welter apologized for the dog attack and said the city will cover the cost of treatment. Sunday, protesters jammed the Anaheim Police Department to complain about shootings involving police officers. But later the same night -- in a separate incident -- police shot and killed a second man, whom they also considered a gang member, when he allegedly fired at police, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Monday, hundreds held a vigil for Diaz, chanting in Spanish, according to KTLA. The family cites witnesses who say Diaz was talking with two friends around 4 p.m. when a police car drove up with lights on ""and an intent to confront the young men."" Diaz responded ""instinctively when he saw people chasing him and began to run,"" they say in the suit. ""There is a racial and economic component to this shooting,"" said Dana Douglas, an attorney for the family. ""Police don't roust white kids in affluent neighborhoods who are just having a conversation. And those kids have no reason to fear police. But young men with brown skin in poor neighborhoods do. They are targeted by police, and something as simple as a friendly conversation is deemed 'suspicious activity' by police."" Dunn said Wednesday the Diaz shooting took place when officers in the ""high-crime gang neighborhood"" attempted to stop three men, who ran off. ""It was during that foot pursuit that the officer-involved shooting occurred,"" he said. ""The circumstances surrounding that shooting are under investigation by the district's attorney."" Police say Diaz was unarmed but throwing unknown objects while running from police, KABC and KCAL reported, but the family called those comments ""flat-out fabrications."" The suit says Diaz committed no crime and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs when he was shot. Police in Anaheim were involved in six shootings in 2012, all but one of which were fatal, according to KTLA.","NEW: The victim's family files a $50 million lawsuit .

"Aberdeen, Maryland (CNN) -- The man who abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Maryland home restrained her and appeared to have used her credit cards, a law enforcement official said Wednesday. But officials in Aberdeen, Maryland, say they are still looking for motives in the case and haven't found evidence of ransom demands for Violet Ripken, the mother of one of baseball's most celebrated players. Ripken, 74, was safe and resting with relatives Wednesday after a nearly daylong ordeal, authorities said. Police in Aberdeen said a man with a gun showed up at her home between 7 and 8 a.m. Tuesday, then forced her into her vehicle and drove off. She was found about 6:15 a.m. Wednesday in the back seat of her vehicle near her home with her hands bound, but she was otherwise unharmed, police said. Michael Jackson's mom found safe, family drama unfolds . Investigators are looking for a motive. Aberdeen police said that they have no knowledge of a ransom being demanded or paid, and that Cal Ripken apparently wasn't contacted. ""At this time I can say we know of no ransom demand,"" Aberdeen Police Chief Henry Trabert told reporters. He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family. Trabert said Violet Ripken was understandably upset after the ordeal. The official said the suspect put sunglasses on the woman and they drove around all day and made stops for gas. The official said the suspect made no mention of Cal Ripken, an indication that he might not have known she is the mother of a famous former baseball player. The official was not aware of any attempt to ask anyone for a ransom, but said the suspect did take Mrs. Ripken's credit cards and it appears he has used them at several places. Police believe the suspect drove the woman's silver 1998 Lincoln Towncar throughout central Maryland but they aren't sure of precise locations and counties. Police are looking for a white male with a light, thin build in his late 30s to early 40s last seen wearing a light-colored shirt, glasses and ""camo pants."" Police consider the man armed and dangerous. Rich Wolf, a spokesman for the FBI in Baltimore, said the FBI is helping local police investigate the case. The Ripken family released a statement expressing gratitude for Violet Ripkin's safe return. ""This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy,"" the statement said. Cal Ripken Jr. achieved stardom as a shortstop with the Baltimore Orioles and is a member of baseball's Hall of Fame. He holds the Major League Baseball record for playing in the most consecutive games -- 2,632 from 1982 to 1998. He made 19 straight All-Star appearances and won two Most Valuable Player awards, racking up 3,184 hits and 431 home runs. His father, Cal Ripken Sr., was a manager, coach and scout who worked in the Orioles organization for 36 years. He died in 1999. Ripken doesn't stop after retiring .

"New York (CNN) -- Investigators found a sleeping-aid drug in Kerry Kennedy's blood after a recent car accident, according to court documents. The final toxicology results show no alcohol and no drugs other than zolpidem, the generic name for Ambien. ""Moments after the accident occurred, I told police that it was possible that I may have inadvertently taken a sleep aid instead of my daily thyroid medication,"" Kennedy said in a statement released Wednesday. Police found Kennedy, 52, daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and ex-wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, behind the wheel of her damaged Lexus SUV on the morning of July 13. Kerry Kennedy charged in hit-and-run crash . A New York State Police press release said the SUV collided with a tractor-trailer. At a court hearing on July 17 in North Castle, New York, Kennedy pleaded not guilty to charges of driving while impaired. At a news conference after her court appearance, Kennedy said a partial seizure was the cause of the accident -- a seizure she said might have been from a previous injury she suffered on the right side of her brain. The judge released her under her own recognizance. She submitted to both blood and urine tests after the accident. Kennedy said she visited Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she underwent ""a full battery of neurological testing"" to understand her medical condition. Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the district attorney's office in Westchester, declined to comment Wednesday, citing a pending case. In her statement, Kennedy said, ""I am deeply sorry to all those I endangered that day, and am enormously grateful for the support I have received over the past two weeks.""

"Sudlersville, Maryland (CNN) -- When the wind blows the wheat and the corn stalks glisten in the bright sun, it is easy to see why the Schmidt family has farmed Maryland fields for nearly a century. Hans Schmidt is a third-generation farmer. Ever since he can remember, he has gotten cash payments from the federal government to help manage the risk of farming. ""My grandfather emigrated here from Germany, so that's when the farm started. We started with one farm, and as the years grew, my dad and uncle expanded the operation, and now today my brother and I are running the operation,"" Schmidt said, standing between the house he grew up in and the fields where he played as a child. He calculates that the checks he gets from Uncle Sam average about $35,000 a year for his 2,000 acre farm, even in good times when he doesn't need it. But for Schmidt and more than 1 million farmers across the country, that could soon come to a screeching halt. Farm bill is set to reduce U.S. deficit. Does it add up? The Senate is debating a farm bill that would end those payments, which have been in place in one form or another since the Great Depression. The legislation was put together by Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, and Sen. Pat Roberts, the top Republican on the committee. They sat down at the committee table and worked together -- a rare act of real bipartisanship in otherwise polarized times. ""We have developed, I think, a wonderful working relationship, friendship, respect for each other. Pat came to Michigan; I went to Kansas,"" said Stabenow, sitting with Roberts at the table where they negotiated the bill. ""We had a chance to meet growers, great university researchers in both of our states to see the individual challenges of our states. And when you can get past all the, you know, just all the potshots and the partisanship and really listen to each other and talk to each other, that's how you get things done,"" Stabenow said. ""People say back home all the time whether it's Michigan, Kansas, any state, 'Why can't you folks get along back there and do something instead of spinning your wheels and pointing fingers,'"" Roberts said. The result of the bipartisanship: deficit reduction. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the farm bill will cut $23.6 billion in spending over 10 years. ""$23.6 billion to the deficit. Now some people think that's not enough. Some people think that's too much. But we voluntarily came forward. The super committee didn't do that. No other authorizing committee has done that,"" Roberts said. How did they do it? First, they went through the massive farm bill and cut out some antiquated and duplicative programs -- the kind of government waste that makes voters go berserk. For example, the federal government pays some farmers for crops they haven't grown in decades. ""If you had cotton 20 years ago or wheat 20 years ago, you could still get a payment for that today. So we're not going to pay for things you don't grow anymore,"" Stabenow said. And the senators say they would save $15 billion and fundamentally change farm policy in the United States by doing away with direct payments to farmers, replacing them with taxpayer subsidized crop insurance. ""We eliminated four different agriculture subsidies and instead have moved to risk management so we'll support farmers and ranchers when there's a loss, where there's a weather loss, it's a price loss, through crop insurance, through other things where the farmer has some skin in the game,"" Stabenow said. Stabenow and her Republican partner have their critics. ""Unfortunately, it seems that Congress' idea of farm bill reform is to eliminate one subsidy program only to invent a new one to take its place,"" Sen. John McCain said on the Senate floor Friday. Watchdog groups warn the savings may not last because the crop insurance has no caps, and in bad crop years, the cost to taxpayers could explode. The authors scoff at that. ""It is cut. It is a deficit-reduction cut. Now it is true we all have a stake in making sure that farmers during bad weather -- we have had a horrible situation in Michigan now, where cherries and apples and grapes and peaches have been hit because of weather situations. We want to make sure they don't lose the farm,"" Stabenow said. Roberts added that in times of drought, flood or other forces of nature that hurt farmers, Congress generally passes disaster relief bills that cost billions and are bureaucratic nightmares. He argues that crop insurance would avoid that. ""You would have to pay far more in these disaster programs, as opposed to a crop insurance program where a farmer can depend on it and a lender can depend on it, and it's over the long term,"" Roberts said. Leslie Paige from Citizens Against Government Waste also criticizes the senators for not cutting more from the nearly trillion-dollar farm bill. ""I find Stabenow's mantra of huge savings laughable. That is a pittance. We could easily take $100 billion out of all these programs and not impact anyone negatively,"" Paige said. Back at the Schmidt farm, Hans Schmidt says he is all right with losing checks from the government he doesn't always need. ""I'd be happy to give up those subsidies if it's going to help our country get its fiscal responsibilities back in order,"" he said. But he calls new subsidies for his crop insurance critical, since farming is so unpredictable. Last year, for example, he produced 35 bushels per acre, far below the 150 bushel goal. ""If we didn't have the crop insurance, then it's going to take, it takes three, four, five years of good years to make up for that one loss,"" Schmidt said. Even now, a good year, there are always problems brought by Mother Nature beyond the farmers' control. ""If we sell it at high moisture, then they deduct the price because of the cost of drying it down,"" Schmidt said. Critics of the farm bill also say it has too much pork, but not the kind you think of when you think farming. This is the government waste kind of pork -- mostly in the form of popcorn. Popcorn growers slipped in a provision making sure they, too, get government help with crop insurance. ""The price of popcorn has risen 40% in recent years,"" McCain said on the Senate floor in front of pictures of popcorn buckets. ""There isn't a kernel of evidence that they need this subsidy,"" he said, appearing to enjoy his pun. Stabenow and Roberts offered no apologies. ""I guess I would call it a specialty crop. And there is demand for it; just go to the movies or any place at home,"" Roberts said. Any bipartisan effort will invite criticism from both sides of the aisle, and this one is no different. Some Democrats, the party in charge in the Senate, are livid because they say cuts go too deep for people who need it most. Of the savings, $4.5 billion comes from cuts to the food stamp program. ""These kinds of cuts, they hurt children, they hurt families,"" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said earlier this week on the Senate floor. Stabenow responded that they're only cutting waste and fraud. For example, more than a dozen states use federal food stamp subsidies to give a dollar home heating credit for people who do not have a utility bill. ""That's where we're saving dollars, and we've done it in a very cautious and strategic way that brings integrity and accountability to the system but does not in any way affect the benefit structure,"" Stabenow said. Still some ask why farmers need any government help at all, especially since lately agriculture is one of the few sectors of the economy making huge profits.""We all have to eat, and when you look at it, agriculture's one of the largest to trade surpluses we have and we can grow safe, affordable food here in this country. And I don't think we can jeopardize that,"" Schmidt said.","Democratic and Republican senators say trimming subsidies could save $23.6 billion .
Feds pay some farmers subsidies for crops they haven't grown in years .
Critics say proposal could end up costing more than current system .
Others say food stamp cuts in bill would hurt those who need help most ."
"(CNN) -- The man who served as chief of security for former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe boarded a U.S. plane bound for Virginia, where he faces drug trafficking charges, police said Tuesday. Mauricio Santoyo Velasco voluntarily turned himself in to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Colombia's capital after a weekend of negotiations, Colombian police said. According to a federal indictment unsealed last month, Santoyo is accused of working with paramilitary groups to smuggle cocaine into the United States from about 2002 to 2008. Uribe was popular as president in part because of his tough stance against leftist rebels. But critics accused his administration of siding with paramilitary groups, which also deal in drugs, in its fight. Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International had called for a complete cutoff of U.S. military aid to Colombia due to the armed forces' alleged ties to paramilitaries. Specifically, Santoyo is accused of accepting bribes from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, a now demobilized paramilitary umbrella organization, and the Oficina de Envigado, a criminal organization that was originally founded by drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. Santoyo would provide assistance to these groups, inform them of police investigations and wiretaps, as well as carrying out unauthorized wiretaps, the indictment charged. He served as chief of security for Uribe from 2000 to 2006. Santoyo is ""voluntarily coming to the United States to face these charges,"" said his attorney, John Zwerling. ""I think it speaks well."" His client has proclaimed that he is not guilty and is expected to make the same plea once he is before a U.S. judge, the lawyer said. It's not known if prosecutors will ask that Santoyo to be detained pending a possible trial. The former president distanced himself from Santoyo, a retired police general, via his Twitter account after the indictment became public. Santoyo was assigned to him by defense and police officials, he said. ""I reject, with pain and indignation, any delinquent conduct, in which according to ongoing judicial proceedings, involve General Santoyo,"" Uribe's Twitter account said.

"(CNN) -- In the marshland just south of the seaside-resort of Anaklia in Western Georgia, the air is often filled with birdsong and the croak of tiny frogs. But added to nature's chorus is the sound of construction, something difficult to escape along Georgia's Black Sea Coast. Anaklia is still being built and the marshlands are being drained to make way for new five-star hotels. A new railway and airport are planned as the government aims to bring back the tourists who used to come to Anaklia during Soviet times. But there are bigger plans than that. Georgia's president Mikheil Saakashvili wants to build a whole new city called Lazika. The promotional video for it presents an impression of futuristic skyscrapers, golf courses and high-end luxury for the entrepreneurs who will make this city their home. Lazika will be a new port on Georgia's Black Sea coast and a special economic zone where businesses can operate under UK law. Rather than attract businesses to established cities the government feels it's easier to start from scratch. ""If we want to be exceptional and if we want to create this hub economy, a place for the rest of the world to come and invest in Georgia, then we have to be creative,"" says Vera Kobalia, Georgia's 28-year-old economy minister. ""And Lazika is being very creative."" And all this in five years, according to Iva Davitaia who admits that there are currently no international investors in the project ""but we do have international interest."" Many local residents are enthusiastic as Lazika would mean jobs for a community that struggles to make a living through agriculture. But just 20 kilometers (12 miles) south is Poti, Georgia's main port that others believe should be revived before a new city is built. Currently the area is sparsely populated and Georgia has a population of around 4.5 million, begging the question 'Where will the 500,000 future Lazika residents come from?' President Saakashvili is a man who operates at breakneck speed and is quick to defend Lazika. ""We are looking for a new destination not for the sake of spending lots of money like some other governments have done just to show off,"" he says. ""We only look at it as a way to generate more income, more goods, more services."" Saakashvili it seems is a man who thrives on projects and it's easy to imagine some falling by the wayside, although the country has been transformed since he came to power in 2003. The Black Sea resort of Batumi has turned from a warlord's paradise into a bustling tourist town where Donald Trump is the latest to invest and the country's parliament building has been moved from its traditional home in the capital Tbilisi to a futuristic new government building in Kutaisi . Yet behind the construction boom Georgia's economic fundamentals remain difficult. Unemployment hovers at 16% and poverty is still widespread. Projects like Lazika sound wonderful but it may have to be seen to be believed. CNN's Eye On series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile. However CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports .","Plans to build city for 500,000 on marshland in Georgia .

"(CNN) -- A doctor at a top New York hospital is accused of using a small ""pen"" camera clipped to a newspaper to record video up a woman's skirt on a Manhattan subway line, authorities said Friday. Urologist Adam Levinson, 39, has been charged with unlawful surveillance in the second degree after being arraigned Thursday. His bail was set at $5,000 cash, and he could get up to four years in prison, prosecutors said. ""No, this cannot be happening right in front of my face,"" said Sheldon Birthwright, 46, who said he witnessed the transgression on a southbound 4 train. ""He was holding the paper, moving his hand very slightly around as a woman was standing in front of him and looking around like he was trying to see if anybody was watching,"" he added. ""Every time she would move, he would move."" Birthwright, a former Transportation Security Administration employee, followed Levinson off the train when it stopped at the 14th Street Station at Union Square. He said he followed Levinson, who was following another woman up a flight of stairs to another platform, and then informed police. Authorities say the pen camera's memory revealed multiple images of a woman. Levinson works at Manhattan's Mount Sinai Medical Center, which suspended him as authorities investigate and as the hospital conducts its own investigation, according to hospital spokesman Ian Michaels. Levinson's attorney, Eugene B. Nathanson, could not be reached for comment. The next court date is set for October 15.","Doctor accused of using ""pen"" camera to record video up a woman's skirt .

"(CNN) -- In 2011, as the world marked 10 years since 9/11, we asked artists around the globe to illustrate the ripple effects of the terrorist attacks. The result was ""9/11 Ripple,"" CNN's first digital art gallery. With the 2012 elections approaching, we again wanted to include artists in our coverage of a major news event. Artists provide unique insight and provoke thought, conversation and community in a critical way and are especially vital during such important times for our country and our world. This time we chose the theme of ""Power"" for our digital art gallery. The theme represents not just the obvious power that's at stake in the election but the more subtle forces that power us as a people and drive our debate over money, health, race and gender -- often to the point of protest and gridlock. Explore the ""Power"" digital election art gallery . We then reached out to a broad yet select group of artists representing different, influential perspectives in the art world and the broader community and asked them to submit work and participate in building the gallery with us. Our search began in the spring when we met Brad Downey, an exciting American performance artist who was in Atlanta for a collaboration with flux projects. After watching a presentation of his work -- which included videos of creative street art that many would call vandalism -- we asked if he'd be interested in contributing to ""Power,"" the only caveat being that he couldn't vandalize anything. The work he submitted is provocative -- a photograph of a CCTV camera on a pole in Karl Marx Allee in Berlin that appears to be on fire. His statement for ""CCTV Sacrifice"" sums up his approach: ""Some people say the world will end in fire, while others say it will end with ice. FREEZE, we are watching you!"" (Downey promises us that nothing was damaged and no laws were broken in producing his work.) No less provocative is a video by Joe Hollier, ""Era of Great Cynicism."" Set to a syncopated jazz-era beat, his stop-motion animation is a commentary on individuality, beliefs, media influence, health care, elections and more. Noah Fischer, who took part in the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York and initiated Occupy Subways and Occupy Museums, created ""The Power of Gold."" The video juxtaposes images of the Statue of Liberty with a rotating gold coin, and his statement explains his intentions: ""The fear instinct tells us to grab what we need to survive ... yet we live in a nation that once took the goddess of freed slaves as its muse."" Another video performance artist we're excited about featuring is Liz Magic Laser. Her ""Push Poll"" video, complete with actors, a focus group moderator and a pop-up newsroom in New York's Chinatown, ""explores the power of polls to influence public opinion and the persuasive effects of the so-called 'man on the street' news segments."" Other works include Seb Jarnot's ""The War of Smiles,"" Molly Crabapple's ""Big Fish Eat Little Fish Eat Big Fish"" and Dorothy O'Connor's ""Tornado."" Jarnot, a French illustrator whose work has appeared in major publications and ad campaigns, took part in ""Ripple."" His work this year features ""over-smiley portraits"" of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, which he says represent ""violence and power in a fight between ... two different energies."" Crabapple's playful painting featuring fish is a ""metaphor for revolution and counterrevolution"" following the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street movements. And O'Connor's ""Tornado"" portrays a woman creating a destructive whirlwind in her home -- a symbol, she says, of the interplay of democracy, voters and corporate donors. This is only a taste of what you'll find in ""Power,"" our effort to create a space in which different voices can be heard in ways other than words. We hope it will be thought provoking, and we invite you to join the conversation by posting your comments on the gallery.","As 2012 elections approach, CNN asked artists to illustrate the theme of ""Power""

"(CNN) -- Defending English Premier League champions Manchester City had to come from behind twice to snatch a 2-2 draw at improved Liverpool Sunday. Liverpool stumbled to a 3-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion on the opening day of the season, but could count themselves unfortunate not to claim three points at Anfield. Martin Skrtel headed them ahead from a Steven Gerrard corner after 34 minutes, but the visitors drew level after Yaya Toure capitalized on hesitancy just after the hour mark. Liverpool responded almost immediately as a long-range free kick from Luis Suarez eluded City goalkeeper Joe Hart to put them 2-1 ahead. Man Utd and pacesetting Chelsea win . But they could not hold their lead and in the 80th minute Skrtel was the villain as his back pass fell short of Pepe Reina and Carlos Tevez swooped to round the home goalkeeper and equalize. Both sides had chances to claim three points in a frantic finish with substitute Andy Carroll's header cleared off the line by City's new signing Jack Rodwell. Joe Allen, one of new manager Brendan Rogers' summer acquisitions, had a fine game on his Anfield debut. ""Here at Anfield the atmosphere was fantastic, as I expected. I'm looking forward to playing here this season. ""The style of Brendan's play is a big, positive factor for everyone, and the players are looking forward to playing under Brendan Rodgers,"" he told Sky Sports. Arsenal drew blank for the second straight EPL fixture after being held to a 0-0 draw at Stoke in the earlier kickoff Sunday. Arsenal, third last season, lost star striker Robin van Persie to rivals Manchester United in the close season and have lacked a cutting edge in their opening two fixtures. Stoke, who drew 1-1 at Reading in their opener, also have two points after two games to lie 11th in the early table with Arsenal 12th. ""It's never a disaster to win a point at Stoke,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed after the match, urging patience as his new signing s Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski bed in.","Champions Man City held to 2-2 draw at Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- Endurance swimmer and record-holder Diana Nyad arrived in Florida Tuesday morning, but not in the manner she hoped. The 61-year-old arrived in Key West aboard a boat, hours after abandoning a 103-mile swim from Cuba to Florida at about the halfway point. She had attempted to become the first person to swim between Cuba and Florida without a shark cage, but ocean swells, shoulder pain and asthma forced her to give up the swim. Nyad was vomiting when she was brought aboard a boat at 12:45 a.m. Tuesday -- 29 hours after she jumped into the water Sunday. ""I would be lying to say I'm not deeply, deeply disappointed,"" she told CNN. ""This was a big dream, not just of the last two years but some 30 years ago when I tried it."" ""The swim was in me,"" she said, but the conditions were not on her side. After all of the work and effort that her supporters and followers invested in the last two years in preparation for the swim, Nyad said it was unlikely that she would attempt the Cuba to Florida swim again. After much consideration, Nyad made the decision to call off the swim and was quickly taken aboard the Bellissimo, the 75-foot yacht that carried her handlers, drivers, photographers, as well as friends and family. Once on the boat, under her own power, Nyad worked her way up the stairs and into a waiting chair, overwhelmed with exhaustion and emotion. She was given intravenous fluids as she battled nausea. Some three hours later, she rose to her feet and walked inside the boat. There, lying down, she talked to those on board, a mini-press conference of sorts with half a dozen cameras at work. Nyad said that as early as the third hour of her journey she began experiencing pain in her right shoulder. By hour 15, asthma was a problem. As hour 28 approached, the pain was so great that she had to rest every 30 to 40 freestyle strokes, rolling onto her back to breathe. Her doctor, Michael Broder, would swim to her on breaks to monitor vitals or administer medication. ""I'm hurting, I'm hurting,"" Nyad told him, clutching her shoulder and looking to the stars. Then, she'd turn back into the water, struggling through another stroke or two, pushing and pushing and pushing. By hour 29, she was weighing the math between belabored strokes. She asked: ""Do I have to swim all night and all day and all night again?"" The answer was yes. Nyad switched to a breast stroke, a last hope to find a way to propel herself to land. A handful of strokes. More rest. A few minutes more. And, finally, she made the decision. It was over. ""Asthma took so much out of me,"" she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. ""I couldn't overcome it."" Nyad said she took at least 40 inhaler puffs and even took oxygen to help improve her breathing. ""We did everything we could to get out of asthma distress, but I couldn't have gone another hour, couldn't have done it,"" she said. ""I really believed willpower would get me through, but the asthma really shafted me,"" she added. She willed herself to go as far as she did, and was willing to doggy-paddle to the end if necessary, she told CNN. After the seas kicked up and she was ailing, however, she knew mental toughness alone would not be enough. ""I just knew it wasn't mind over matter anymore. I was absolutely spent,"" she said. After her rigorous training -- which included a 24-hour swim for practice, ending her swim was ""a bitter pill to swallow,"" Nyad said. It was an end to a journey that started off looking much brighter. ""Earlier in the evening, she was surrounded by dolphins and a beautiful Caribbean sunset. But strong currents blew her 15 miles off course,"" her team posted on her Twitter account. The attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida was the second for the swimmer, who said at a news conference Sunday that she is fitter today than she was in 1978, when she first attempted the crossing but was unable to finish. It took several months to gain permission for the swim from Cuban and U.S. authorities. Bureaucratic snags repeatedly threatened to call off the effort -- already called off in 2010 because of weather. ""To swim between these two neighbors, Cuba and the United States, who've been strangers all these years, is a moving thing for me,"" Nyad had said. She had been training for the event for two years, swimming up to 12 hours a day. A team of more than 30 people supported Nyad as she attempted the crossing. She had 10 handlers to advise her as she swam, ocean kayakers towing devices to repel most sharks and divers and safety officers trained to distract sharks that were not turned away. The lesson that others can take away from her journey is to be your best self, she said. ""You have to live your life with passion, you show your will, you feel proud of yourself when you go to bed at night,"" she said. CNN's Jennifer Hyde contributed to this report.","NEW: Nyad is unlikely to try the swim again .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just a few minutes after 7 a.m. on Saturday, Mitt Romney took a step many political experts did not think he would -- choosing a controversial and bold running mate and making one of the most important announcements of his campaign at a time many did not expect. Rep. Paul Ryan admits that he is the poster child for controversial proposals to reform the nation's entitlement programs: For workers now under the age of 55, seniors would be given the option of choosing a private program instead of the traditional Medicare program and would receive money to offset the premium they have to pay. Federal spending for Medicaid would be sent to the states to manage, and the Social Security retirement age would gradually be raised to 70. Because of those positions and his full-throttled defense of them, CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger calls the pick ""a risky choice that could hurt Mitt Romney"" and also said it ""may be too risky, but is bold."" Republican consultant Ford O'Connell said making a bold choice like Ryan was necessary. Romney announces Ryan as his running mate . ""With Mitt Romney losing ground to President Obama in the polls, I don't see the selection of Paul Ryan as 'risky,' I see the choice as bold and necessary,"" O'Connell wrote in an email to CNN. ""Ryan will certainly help Romney shore up his support with the GOP base, and it will send a clear message to independent voters that Romney is serious about getting the country's fiscal house in order and putting Americans back to work."" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen says the Ryan pick is, ""an opportunity for the Romney campaign to go on the offense."" Ryan is seen as a plainspoken Midwesterner who doesn't back down from positions. Democratic attacks on Ryan focus on changes to Medicare and Medicaid . ""If you don't address these issues now, they're going to steamroll us as a country. And the issue is the more you delay fixing these problems, the much uglier the solutions are going to be,"" Ryan told Borger in an interview last year. ""We literally go about $10 trillion deeper in the hole of our unfunded government promises every year we delay fixing the problem."" Several leading conservative voices, including the Weekly Standard and the Wall Street Journal, had pushed Romney this week to be bold. ""The case for Mr. Ryan is that he best exemplifies the nature and stakes of this election. More than any other politician, the House Budget Chairman has defined those stakes well as a generational choice about the role of government and whether America will once again become a growth economy or sink into interest-group dominated decline,"" the Journal said in an editorial on Thursday. The Journal argued that a Ryan choice would help the Republicans. Opinion: How Ryan could help Romney . ""The larger strategic point is that Mr. Romney's best chance for victory is to make this a big election over big issues. Mr. Obama and the Democrats want to make this a small election over small things -- Mitt's taxes, his wealth, Bain Capital. As the last two months have shown, Mr. Romney will lose that kind of election. To win, Mr. Romney and the Republicans have to rise above those smaller issues and cast the choice as one about the overall direction and future of the country."" Ryan, a 42-year-old fitness freak, also brings a youthful vigor to the campaign and is an energetic campaigner and debater. He jogged tieless onto the stage on Saturday as Romney introduced him to a cheering crowd. But there will be those who question whether a House member whose primary focus has been fiscal issues is ready to be commander-in-chief. Obama's campaign quickly fired off a statement looking to define the contrasts in the campaign: The Republican ticket favors tax cuts for the wealthy while putting a greater burden on the middle class, it would gut Medicare and shift costs to the elderly, and it would make deep cuts in education. As statement from Obama campaign manager Jim Messina also invoked the B-word: . ""As a member of Congress, Ryan rubber-stamped the reckless Bush economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy. Now the Romney-Ryan ticket would take us back by repeating the same, catastrophic mistakes,"" Messina wrote. Exclusive: How Romney chose his running mate . Besides the choice of who, political analysts also call the timing of the Ryan announcement bold. While most vice presidential picks have been announced only days before the Republican convention, Romney is unveiling his ticket -- which the campaign is calling ""America's Comeback Team"" -- more than two weeks before the GOP gathers in Tampa, Florida. Some experts have said such an early choice would diminish any bump in the polls the campaign might see. The Romney campaign argues that the continuous news environment in the nation now means old rules may not apply. It is hoping that Ryan's unveiling will get a lot of positive coverage as it couples the announcement with a bus tour of swing states through Tuesday. Romney's aides hope the coverage will give the campaign a break from some of the bad press it has gotten over the last week following gaffes during his tour of Europe and Israel, relentless calls for Romney to release more of his tax returns and falling poll numbers.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican sources say they're in a Catch-22 situation on how to reply to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's claims that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney went 10 years without paying taxes. They understand that they're taking Reid's bait and that responding to his unsubstantiated claims against Romney keeps alive the issue of Romney's refusing to release his tax returns. Still, these GOP sources say they feel that if they do not respond to such a serious charge from such a high-ranking Democrat, it will look like a tacit admission Reid is right. Republicans stepped up attempts to undermine Reid's unsubstantiated allegations Monday, saying Reid and other Democrats' accusations are being orchestrated by President Barack Obama's campaign -- specifically his senior campaign adviser, David Axelrod. To that end, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer noted that Axelrod visited Senate Democrats for their weekly lunch last Tuesday. Later that afternoon, a Huffington Post story was published with Reid's allegations about the presumptive GOP nominee not paying any taxes. Opinion: Why won't Romney release more tax returns? ""You've got to wonder if the so-called source is Axelrod himself,"" Spicer said. ""Hours after meeting with Axelrod, Reid comes out and makes baseless accusations?"" Axelrod flatly denied that allegation, calling it ""completely false"" and saying he ""never had any such discussion."" ""Instead of pointing fingers in every direction, they can put the whole matter to rest by simply observing the standard George Romney and a generation of candidates have set by releasing the returns,"" Axelrod said. In a separate article posted Monday, the Huffington Post reported that it interviewed Reid days before Axelrod's visit, making any influence from the top Obama official's Capitol Hill visit impossible. By trying to tie Reid's remarks to the Obama campaign, Republicans are trying to hit Democrats where it could hurt most: the president's credibility. That comes after the GOP response to Reid got increasingly hostile and personal over the weekend. ""I'm not going to respond to a dirty liar who hasn't filed a single page of tax returns himself (and) complains about people with money but lives in the Ritz-Carlton here down the street,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on ABC News. ""And the fact that we're going to spend any time talking about it is ridiculous."" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also used the ""L"" word to describe Reid's statements, which were repeated on the Senate floor later in the week, saying the majority leader is ""making things up."" ""What he did on the floor of the Senate is so out of bounds. I think he's lying about his statement, of knowing something about Romney,"" Graham said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Big GOP convention roles revealed . As for Reid, he tried to turn the focus right back to where he wants it. ""This whole issue is not about me,"" Reid said in his home state of Nevada on Monday. ""Mitt Romney's the first presidential candidate since his dad ran not to release his income tax returns. He's released one income tax return, and that points toward the Bahamas, Switzerland and a few other foreign countries. This whole controversy will end very quickly if he releases his income tax returns, like everybody else has done."" Romney has released his tax return from 2010 and an estimate from 2011. He has vowed to release his full 2011 return once it's completed, but he will not release past years', as previous presidential candidates have done. Meanwhile, Reid chief of staff David Krone insisted Monday, again, that he knows who Reid's source is -- and that the source is credible. ""I know who this person is, and if I thought this person was not credible, I would say something to Sen. Reid. I would try to shut it down. This person is credible,"" Krone said. ""This person has asked Reid to protect the confidentiality of this person, but it's real,"" he continued. ""This person told him this. This person said it to Sen. Reid."" Multiple Democratic sources insist that Reid made the allegations against Romney on his own but also admit the Obama campaign is not telling him to back off. Sources close to Reid say he knew full well he would be challenged by Republicans and the media for accusing Romney of not paying taxes for 10 years but not offering any proof. But these sources say Reid didn't care -- in fact, he was eager to do it. Growing up impoverished in a trailer with no running water in Searchlight, Nevada, Reid literally fought his way out as a boxer. As a politician, he has never been afraid to punch below the belt, especially when he dislikes someone personally, and by all accounts Reid has a strong personal disregard for Romney. Obama debuts 'Romney Hood' Through the years he has called President George W. Bush a loser and a liar, named then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan a political hack and gone after Sen. John McCain during the 2008 presidential race as someone too temperamental to be president. But Republicans say this time, Reid took it too far, not only because he won't back up his accusation beyond citing a confidential source but because he chose to attack Romney on the issue from the Senate floor. Romney himself pushed back against Reid's accusations twice last week, insisting that he has paid a lot of money in taxes -- and telling the majority leader to either ""put up or shut up."" CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Senate Majority Leader Reid says Mitt Romney went 10 years without paying taxes .

"(CNN) -- In most presidential races this close, it is a battle for the undecideds and independents. Pre-convention interviews with both Republican and Democratic delegates suggest this year might be more like trench warfare -- firing up the party faithful, starting in Tampa and Charlotte, to mobilize a high grassroots voter turnout in November. ""Conventional wisdom is that this election is about independents, but in reality it's about the base,"" said Orit Sklar, a Georgia-based longtime Romney activist attending her first convention as part of a state delegation. ""For Republicans, it means the convention is that much more important this time around. Our base has to be energized leaving Tampa, because we have to do everything we can not only to elect Mitt Romney, but to win the Senate and gain greater control of the House."" Like President Barack Obama, Philadelphia City Councilman Kenyatta Johnson launched his political career as an inner-city community activist. He says the mission is no different for Democrats. ""I'm a grassroots organizer at heart. ... You've got to make sure you get everyone at every level involved, all pushing the same message,"" he said. ""We want to make sure we go block by block, house by house, door by door, to make sure we get every vote possible."" Paul loyalists say 'we can do better' That view is echoed by Georgia Democratic delegate Steve Henson, minority leader of the state Senate. ""You better be on your p's and q's on Election Day and make sure your people are coming,"" he said. ""Turnout's a concern in every state for both parties. You've got to get your people to the polls."" Republicans liken this year's race to 1980 when the contrasts between the two candidates -- Ronald Reagan and then-President Jimmy Carter -- were just as stark. Obama, Romney: No more niceness . But some analysts say the more apt comparison is 2004 when the incumbent, Republican George W. Bush, ""was as much of a lightning rod as President Obama is today,"" as chief CNN pollster Keating Holland put it. ""This is not an election where you are trying to persuade independents,"" Holland said. ""The selection of Paul Ryan is evidence of this. ... The Ryan pick was a base election strategy."" Ryan's selection was heartily applauded by Debbie Dooley, the Atlanta-based national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots. ""I didn't think Romney would be bold or courageous enough to pick Paul Ryan as his running mate,"" she said. ""That signals the direction he's going in. He's not trying to run away from some of the statements Paul Ryan has made in regards to Medicare and some of the other issues."" Before Romney picked Ryan, some conservatives seemed to be more anti-Obama than pro-Romney. A similar situation existed in 2004, with Republicans occupying the White House. ""With all respect to John Kerry, the party was united against Bush,"" recalled Michigan Democratic Chairman Mark Brewer, who is going to his sixth convention, this time as a so-called ""super-delegate."" ""He ran as a compassionate conservative in 2000. That went out the door with tax cuts for the rich and two wars he paid for with credit cards."" Opinion: What GOP needs to do in Tampa . Kentucky GOP delegate Mark Metcalf is a U.S. Army reservist who served in Iraq after working in the Bush Justice Department and later at the Pentagon as associate deputy general counsel. Metcalf went to his first convention in 1980, as chairman of Kentucky's Young Republicans and a supporter of dark horse presidential candidate Howard Baker, the senator from Tennessee who achieved fame by asking ""What did the president know, and when did he know it?"" during the Watergate scandal that brought down Richard Nixon. ""It was a convention I went to believing in a man who really didn't get very far in the presidential race, and I left as an advocate for Ronald Reagan,"" he says. Of this year's contest, Metcalf says: ""In my lifetime, I think this is probably the most important presidential election we've ever had. There's two very different visions of America offered by Governor Romney and President Obama. What's at stake is the free enterprise system as it has been articulated during the history of this country. ""President Obama stands for more government, less freedom and less personal responsibility. Governor Romney stands for free enterprise, less government, more freedom."" Two Democratic delegates from Florida stressed the importance of Obama's appeal to minorities and young people, voter blocs that were pivotal for him four years ago. ""I think the outcome of the election may very well be determined by the number of young people who come out to vote,"" said Stephanie Rosendorf, 21, director of political affairs for Florida College Democrats, a first-time voter herself in 2008. ""I think we can either choose to re-elect our president and continue to make progress or we can go back to the last decade and its failed policies."" Annette Taddeo, a Colombian-American small business owner, ran for Congress on the ticket with Obama in 2008 but lost to popular Cuban-born Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in south Florida. A longtime party activist, she was cheered by Obama's decision to exempt from deportation children of illegal immigrants who pursue a college education, his endorsement of same-sex marriage and the party's proposed platform plank embracing that position. Of Obama's runs for the presidency, Taddeo says, ""The first time it was historic; this time it's personal because the attacks have been so personal -- frankly, below the belt -- throughout his presidency. It's unacceptable. ""Obamacare wasn't good enough even though it's the same as Romneycare just because it came from his mouth."" Dooley, who stresses fiscal conservatism over social issues, says tea party get-out-the-vote efforts are focused on Senate, congressional and local contests. ""If we get people out for those races, those people are going to vote for Romney,"" she says. ""We feel Georgia is a red state so the Tea Party Patriots and Atlanta Tea Party are sending people to Florida, maybe Virginia, some of the other battleground states, to help there."" Holland, the CNN pollster, says it all gets down to the grassroots. ""The Republican conventional wisdom is the Obama coalition from 2008 was a coalition of people who are known for not voting,"" he said. ""So they believe if they motivate their base and Obama tries to mobilize his base, he will fall short."" Brewer, the Michigan Democratic chairman, disagrees with that scenario. ""I think there really is respect and affection for the president for all the things he's done under the circumstances,"" he said. ""And then we look at the alternative -- Romney and the tea party Republicans and all the things they would roll back, overturn and repeal.""","Romney activist: election not about independents but about the party base .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The ""heaviest rain in six decades"" in the Chinese capital of Beijing has left at least 37 people dead, the state news agency Xinhua reported Sunday. The torrential downpour lasted 10 hours, with gusty winds in some areas and a tornado in one suburb, according to local media. During the storm, traffic was paralyzed for hours, with drivers and pedestrians stranded throughout the city. Many streets were flooded with water levels sometimes as deep as 13 feet (4 meters). Thousands of emergency responders were deployed and divers had to be brought in to search for anyone trapped. Officials said almost 2 million people were affected by the rainstorm and the economic losses have exceeded $1.5 billion. Drowning is the leading cause of death, taking 25 lives, Xinhua reported. But six people were killed by collapsing houses, five were electrocuted, and one was hit by lightning, the agency reported, citing the municipal government. The average rainfall Saturday was 6.7 inches, but one suburban district recorded 18 inches, Xinhua said. Authorities have identified 22 bodies so far, the agency reported. At the Beijing International Airport, more than 500 flights were canceled Saturday. At one point, some 80,000 passengers were stranded in the airport terminals. Even as operations slowly returned to normal, there were reports of passengers still stranded late Sunday. Local television broadcast heroic stories of search and rescue efforts and people helping each other, but online, people were critical. Many complained that authorities seemed ill-prepared despite heavy rain having been forecast days in advance. Critics said there was no emergency broadcast system deployed, no government shelters and no special hotlines. They also complained of a fragile, ill-prepared infrastructure, pointing out the sewer system was overwhelmed by the rains. Xinhua reported the flooding submerged some power supply facilities and led to blackouts in parts of the city.","The flooding stemmed from torrential rains, Chinese state media says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge appointed TJ Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Tito Jackson, as temporary guardian of Michael Jackson's three children in the absence of their grandmother, Katherine Jackson. ""We have reason to believe that Mrs. Jackson has been held against her will,"" Katherine Jackson attorney Sandra Ribera told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff at a hearing Wednesday. Immediately after the hearing however, another attorney for Jackson, Perry Sanders, said he had been told by Randy Jackson that his mother was on her way back to California. Sanders, who later spoke to his client as she was being driven home, said he will file a petition to restore her as custodian as soon as he meets with her. Katherine Jackson was unaware of the controversy swirling around her family for the past week, he said. Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show . Beckloff suspended Katherine Jackson as custodian for Prince, Paris and Prince Michael II, known as Blanket, because she may be ""prevented from acting as a guardian because of the acts of third parties."" He also ordered ""that the children not be removed from California without a court order, by any person."" The judge also ordered that Diana Ross, whom Michael Jackson named as backup guardian in his will, and Debbie Rowe, the biological mother of the two oldest children, be given notice of the order. The order will be reconsidered at a hearing next month, and the judge left open the possibility that custody could be returned sooner if Katherine Jackson returns home. Katherine Jackson finally called her home Tuesday night after being out of communication for nine days, her lawyer said. TJ Jackson, whom Katherine Jackson left in charge of the children when she left home on July 15, said he was disturbed by how she sounded. ""I've never heard my grandmother talk like that,"" he said about that phone call. ""She wasn't sharp. Her words were slurred. Her choice of vocabulary, I never heard her use those phrases."" His lawyer said that ""maybe she was trying to speak to him in code."" Ribera said one of the children told her it sounded like she was not alone during that call. Sanders said the call was made after he met with Jermaine and Janet Jackson at a spa near Tucson, Arizona, on Tuesday night to resolve the controversy over Katherine Jackson's whereabouts. They did not, however, allow him to meet or talk with her, he said. Katherine Jackson, 82, left the home she shares with Michael Jackson's children on July 15. She had not contacted them before Tuesday, though a Los Angeles County sheriff's investigation concluded she was safe in Arizona. Jackson family feud caught on tape . Katherine Jackson has custody of Michael Jackson's children and a 20% share in her son's huge estate. Her husband, Joe Jackson, and her eight surviving children were completely left out of Michael Jackson's will when the pop star died in 2009. Authorities got involved when her nephew Trent filed a missing person report with the sheriff's office over the weekend. Security camera video obtained by CNN captured a tense scene at the Calabasas, California, home she shares with her three grandchildren. Siblings Janet, Jermaine and Randy Jackson attempted to persuade the older children, Prince and Paris, to leave Katherine Jackson's home with them Monday. Paris and Prince resisted, according to three sources with knowledge of the incident, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The video shows Janet Jackson apparently trying to take a cell phone away from Paris and scolding her niece for using her phone to write about family issues on Twitter, according to the three sources. Paris, Michael Jackson's 14-year-old daughter, posted a Twitter message at about the same time: ""gotta love fam."" Meanwhile, 15-year-old Prince is seen walking away from his Uncle Randy into the home's security office. Paris soon followed, and Randy and Janet Jackson appeared to be recording the incident with their cell phones. Minutes later, sheriff's deputies broke up a scuffle involving Randy and Jermaine Jackson and Trent Jackson, who works for their mother, according to several people who witnessed it. No one was arrested, although a battery report was taken and an investigation is ongoing, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said.

"(Time.com) -- Here's another reason to log off at a reasonable hour: exposure to dim lighting at night — such as that generated by a TV screen, computer or night-light — may lead to depressive symptoms, new animal research suggests. A study from Ohio State University Medical Center found that hamsters with chronic exposure to dim light at night showed signs of depression within just a few weeks: reduced physical activity compared with hamsters living in normal light-dark conditions, as well as less interest in sugar water (a treat for the hamsters), greater signs of distress when placed in water, and changes in the brain's hippocampus that are similar to brain changes seen in depressed people. ""The results we found in hamsters are consistent with what we know about depression in humans,"" Tracy Bedrosian, the first author the on the new study, told reporters. Time.com: TV, video games at night may cause sleep problems in kids . Mood disorders are by no means the only health condition linked to artificial lighting and screen time at night. Earlier this year, the American Medical Association (AMA) put out a disturbing summary of adverse health effects from nighttime lighting, noting that artificial lights disrupt circadian rhythms and alter the body's normal hormonal responses. In particular, when people spend too little time in darkness, it seems that the body suppresses release of the hormone melatonin, which — among other things — is thought to fight tumor growth and cancers. Other health conditions affected by changes in circadian rhythms, according to the AMA report, may include obesity, diabetes and reproductive problems. ""The good news is that people who stay up late in front of the television and computer may be able to undo some of the harmful effects just by going back to a regular light-dark cycle and minimizing their exposure to artificial light at night,"" Bedrosian says. ""That's what the results we found in hamsters would suggest."" Those animals' depressive symptoms, at least, went away once the hamsters returned to a schedule that included eight full hours of total darkness per day. Time.com: 5 ways to survive daylight saving time . Bedrosian and her colleagues say that, among humans, exposure to artificial lighting at night has surged over the past 50 years, a trend that happens to coincide with large increases in depression prevalence. Light pollution can come from TV and computer screens, other electronic displays and ambient sources such as streetlights, passing traffic and neighboring buildings, in addition to overhead lighting within the home. For their study, the Ohio State researchers also investigated molecular mechanisms that may cause the brain changes associated with nighttime lighting. The scientists found that a cell-signaling protein, or cytokine, known as a hippocampal TNF (tumor necrosis factor) played a limited role. They demonstrated that by inhibiting TNF signaling, some of the depressive effects of light at night could be reversed in the hamsters. The results are published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.

"(CNN) -- The woman whose public accusation of sexual harassment helped push Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain out of the 2012 race called his decision to suspend the campaign ""bittersweet"" Monday. Sharon Bialek told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that she was happy Cain decided to halt his presidential bid -- ""but it saddened me because even though he did so, he still has not spoken the truth."" ""He's trying to blame everything that's happened on everyone else except the one person that he should blame it on, and that's himself,"" she said. Cain ended his run for the White House on Saturday, saying he would focus instead on his family and on promoting his economic proposals from outside Washington. John King: Who gains with Cain's campaign suspended? He called the allegations against him ""false and untrue,"" but said he was bowing out after assessing the impact allegations by Bialek and others were having on his wife, his family and his supporters. Earlier, Bialek told reporters during an appearance with her attorney, Gloria Allred, that she didn't feel sorry for Cain -- ""not any more."" ""I did initially,"" she said. ""But when he kept going on and on and lying and making me out to be some troubled woman, then I really stopped feeling sorry for that man."" Cain, the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza and a radio talk-show host, vaulted to the front ranks of GOP contenders in October. But his campaign began to stumble when news emerged that two women had accused him of sexual harassment in the 1990s, when he was president of the National Restaurant Association. Wolf Blitzer: 9-9-9 is dead-dead-dead . In November, Bialek told reporters that after a 1997 dinner in which she had sought Cain's help finding a job, he unexpectedly put his hand on her leg beneath her skirt and pushed her head toward his crotch. She said Cain told her, ""You want a job, right?"" but stopped when she protested. One of the women who filed complaints at the restaurant association, Karen Kraushaar, decided to come forward soon after Bialek went public. Then on November 28, an Atlanta businesswoman, Ginger White, said she had a 13-year affair with Cain that lasted until shortly before he launched his presidential bid. Cain's campaign accused supporters of one of his Republican rivals, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, of planting the initial story. The candidate called Bialek a ""troubled"" woman put up to hurting his campaign by Democratic activists and said he had never met her. And while he admitted knowing White and helping her out financially, he said they were just friends.

Marlon Jackson: I talked to Frank Dileo, Michael's manager. Frank told me that Michael last night was complaining about not feeling well. Michael's doctor went over to see him, and Frank said, ""Marlon, from last night to this morning, I don't know what happened."" When they got to him this morning, he wasn't breathing. They rushed him to the hospital and couldn't bring him around. That's what happened. They don't know what happened. Martin: When was the last time you saw Michael? Jackson: It was May 14 at a family gathering. I had just gotten back from Africa. Michael looked great. He was looking well. He was getting ready to go into rehearsals for his tour. I don't know what happened. Martin: There were some reports he wasn't feeling well and was in a wheelchair. Jackson: He wasn't in a wheelchair. He was walking around with his kids. When we saw him, he wasn't in a wheelchair. We all talked. He was doing great. Martin: Was that the last time you spoke with him? Jackson: May 14 was the last time I spoke with him. The last time I saw him. Martin:  Have you talked to any of your other family members about his death? Jackson: I've been trying to get a hold of my mom. I talked to Jackie. I talked to Tito.

"(CNN) -- After two space shuttle flights in the 1980s, astronaut Sally Ride spent much of the rest of her life trying to encourage children, particularly girls, to give the sciences a shot. Ride, the first American woman in space, was part of a wave of women who entered the traditionally male disciplines of natural sciences and engineering in the 1970s. One of those she inspired was Catherine ""Cady"" Coleman, who told CNN's ""Newsroom"" that she never considered becoming an astronaut before meeting Ride in 1982. ""When I'd think of what they look like, it's those Mercury Seven standing in front of an airplane, a bunch of guys that were older than me with not as much hair,"" she said. ""And suddenly you meet Sally Ride, and it became clear to me that maybe this is something I can pursue."" The human, funny side of Sally Ride . Coleman joined the Air Force, became an astronaut and has racked up more than 4,300 hours in space, including two space shuttle flights and a five-month stint aboard the international space station. ""All of us would like to make a difference, but Sally changed the world,"" she said. Sally Ride opens a new frontier for others . The number of women earning science or engineering degrees grew from about 50,000 in 1966 to about 240,000 in 2006, according to figures from the National Science Foundation. Ride died Monday at age 61. She joined NASA's astronaut corps in 1978, the same year she earned a Ph.D in physics at California's Stanford University. At the time, women earned about 4% of the physics degrees, said Christianne Corbett, a senior researcher at the American Association of University Women. That number is about 20% today, Corbett said. ""She was a real pioneer. Things have really improved dramatically in her lifetime,"" Corbett said. Opinion: Thank you, Sally Ride . Charles Vest, the president of the National Academy of Engineering, served with Ride on the board of the National Math and Science Initiative, an industry-backed effort to boost those subjects. He said Ride was always friendly and good humored, ""an inspiration to everybody."" ""I don't think I have attended a single major event on K-12 science and education where she wasn't present,"" he said. ""My own granddaughter attended one or two Sally Ride events in Washington and was always inspired by them, and was just devastated when she heard the news."" Women today make up about half of the graduates in chemistry and mathematics, and are awarded a majority of bachelor's degrees in biology. But in engineering, only about 20% of graduates are women -- and among all women entering college, only 3 to 5% choose engineering as a major, said Catherine Didion, a program manager at the engineering academy. Tributes pour in for Sally Ride . ""I had the opportunity to work with her and watch some of the students' eyes light up,"" Didion said. ""She had a way to explain the work that she did, and the passion she had for what she did, in a way that was really approachable."" Ride's efforts focused on middle-school students, typically the point at which students are given a choice of elective courses. ""Many of them probably went back home and said, 'Mom, Dad, I know what I want to be,' "" Didion said. But since 2006, the percentage of women going into the sciences has leveled off, Corbett said. There has been a slight decline in female engineering and physics majors, and the number of women choosing computer science has dropped from about 30% in the 1980s to about 18% today. Corbett and Didion said female students still battle the stereotype that males do better at math and science -- and in some cases trim their ambitions accordingly. Dr. Sally Ride . ""Fewer girls tend to go on to careers in those areas because they hold themselves to a higher standard and tend to assess their abilities lower,"" Corbett said. That's often true even when girls get higher grades or standardized test scores, she said. ""Role models like Sally Ride are so important for reducing the effective stereotype,"" Corbett said. ""The more you see women succeeding in these areas, the less strong that stereotype is."" And Vest said studies show appeals to idealism and the potential of new discoveries can help draw women to the field. ""We've been doing a very poor job of explaining the versatility of engineering degrees, and how if you want to improve climate and water and health, it's going to take technological advances to do it,"" he said. Didion said Ride ""not only walked that, she lived that life in giving back to the community."" ""It's hard to overstate the impact that she had on a generation of young women when she made that first spaceflight,"" she said. ""And the fact that she continued to work with young students means she had a ripple effect on several generations.""

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office added another reason to drop the politics and get down to the hard work of health care reform. The nonpartisan organization released a report that finds the cost of repealing the reform will balloon government deficits by $109 billion between 2013 and 2022. The CBO's report reveals the practical hurdles to repeal and underscores a growing pattern in which the key stakeholders -- states, medical providers, businesses, insurers and consumer groups -- are moving beyond the partisan squabble to the no-nonsense work of building the market place of 2014, where everyone will be able to purchase affordable insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions. Doctors, hospitals, insurers and employers are, of course, bargaining to improve their specific stakes. They harbor reservations and uncertainties, but their general approach is ""mend it, not end it."" The medical providers welcome relief from the crushing burden of uncompensated care and from the immorality of leaving the ill without adequate care owing to patients' inability to pay. Insurers look forward to new customers and to a new public conversation that spotlights the broader causes of high medical costs rather than blaming insurers alone. Large employers are nervous about rising costs but are generally more concerned about moderating the rate of growth and ending a system that often shifts costs to them in the financial burden of caring for the uninsured. A series of developments reveals the growing gap between the new reality on the ground and the lingering efforts of those who want to refight battles and repeal the law that the Supreme Court declared constitutional in June. Texas Gov. Rick Perry called Medicaid -- the program for the indigent -- the ""Titanic"" because he didn't believe it was feasible or would prove seaworthy. Meanwhile, private business checked their bottom line and readily saw the new opportunities. Our nation's second-largest insurer, WellPoint, paid $4.9 billion in cash to purchase another insurance company, Amerigroup, to dramatically expand its ability to service the expanding number of people in Medicaid. Wall Street is doubling down on insurers who do Medicaid business because of their confidence in the Medicaid expansion. As repealers complain, the marketplace created 89 new accountable care organizations, which were formed in 40 states to deliver more cost-effective care to more than 1 million people by July 1. With great fanfare, House Republicans held a hearing earlier this month to profile how health reform interferes with patient care. There's one problem: They are unable to feature the leading voices of patient care -- the American Medical Association and American Hospital Association -- because those organizations support reform as good for patients. And then, of course, we have the voters. Only about a fifth push for full repeal. And many Americans, including rank-and-file Republicans, support new protections against insurers who turn away customers with pre-existing conditions or terminate policies when the costs of care pass annual limits. Even if Republicans won the White House and congressional majorities in November, the frustrating legislative trapdoors that slowed and nearly killed health reform in 2009 and 2010 will likely remain hurdles to repeal. The reluctance of stakeholders, states and voters will stir consternation, delay and deadlock. The growing talk among Republicans of what would replace ""repeal"" is an early indicator of the changes afoot. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently offered a dose of reality to calm repeal fever when he counseled that ""it's a lot harder to undo something than it is to stop it in the first place."" Mitt Romney's position may be the most revealing. Against driving hailstorms from those favoring repeal, he has continued to support his reform in Massachusetts because he knows where stakeholders stand. While he won't force states to implement his or the national reforms (he says he'd like to repeal the Affordable Care Act), his continued support for the Massachusetts reform will make it very difficult for him to deny other states the same opportunity that President George W. Bush gave him. Reform of America's health care system is under way, reconfiguring how care is provided and paid for. It is time to shift from symbolism and theatrics to the details of improving the transition that is occurring. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joel Ario and Lawrence R. Jacobs.","Joel Ario, Lawrence Jacobs: Cost of repealing health care reform will increase deficits .
Key stakeholders are starting to build the new health market place, they say .
States, medical providers, businesses, insurers and consumers embrace reform .
Ario, Jacobs: It's time to put aside politics and embrace the new health care system ."
"(CNN) -- The big summer showdown has come and gone. The Supreme Court decided the Affordable Care Act could stand, and so it remains, for the most part, undisturbed. The next hurdle will occur in November, when the country goes to the polls. For the sake of argument, though, let's assume the health care law will not be stripped down by a new president and Congress. In which case, we need to start asking an important question: What will happen with Medicaid? Many Americans still don't understand how Medicaid works. The biggest misperception is that Medicaid is a universal health care program for all poor people. That's just not true. Many people with little to no income do not qualify for Mediaid. Yes, all children up to 100% of the poverty line, and children under 6 up to 133% of poverty line, are covered. Pregnant women up to 133% of the poverty line are covered as well. So are elderly and disabled Americans who qualify for Social Security's Supplemental Security Income. But there's where things start to break down. Parents are covered, but only to 1996 welfare levels. This keeps a lot of parents, even those who are very poor, from qualifying for Medicaid. Two parents and a child living in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana or Texas with an income of $4,850 a year actually earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. And if you're not a parent, then things are even worse. In most states, if you have no children, you can't qualify for Medicaid no matter how little you make. In most states, even if you make no money at all, there's no Medicaid for you. This means Medicaid is far from the safety net many imagine it to be. It has so many holes that when the heath care law really gets going in 2014, more than half (PDF) of the newly insured will be those earning less than 133% of the poverty line. The poor still constitute a significant percent of the uninsured. When the House and the Senate were debating how to cover all of the uninsured, they disagreed. Both bodies agree that those making more than 133% of the poverty line should get private insurance in the exchanges, albeit with subsidies for those making less than 400% of the poverty line. But what to do with those making less than 133% of the poverty line? The Democrats favored the idea of expanding Medicaid, as Medicaid is cheaper than private insurance. In fact, so much so that the House pushed to raise the eligibility for Medicaid for all Americans to 133% of the poverty line, above the Senate's suggested 100%, as it made the entire Affordable Care Act cheaper. This is a radical change for Medicaid. It will finally be the fully universal safety net that many believe it already is. All Americans, regardless of age and parental status, will qualify if they are poor. This won't be cheap, of course. States currently are on the hook for 50% to 75% of all Medicaid costs. Asking them to cover the many millions of newly eligible recipients would be too much for many to bear. Therefore, the federal government decided it would pay for the full cost of the expansion when it begins in 2014. There are two problems, though. The first is that the federal portion decreases to 90% by 2020. That may still sound like a great deal, but even that 10% is a lot of money, and many states fear they won't have it. The second is that the individual mandate and Affordable Care Act in general will probably bring forward a lot of people who already qualified for Medicaid and just never signed up. The federal government won't pay for them, and a lot of states fear this expense. They feared it so much that they brought a case against the expansion that made it all the way to the Supreme Court. The court decided in the states' favor. The health care law can ask states to expand Medicaid and offer them extra money if they will agree to the expansion. The law can even refuse states the extra money if they refuse to expand the program. But what the law can't do is threaten states with removal of their traditional Medicaid money if they won't expand. What this means is that states are free to say no to the Medicaid expansion. That will mean some big problems in implementing the Affordable Care Act. There are really no provisions for people making less than 100% of the poverty lines to receive subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges. Many will not be penalized by the mandate because they make too little (PDF), but that will still leave them without health insurance. In essence, without the Medicaid expansion, millions of the poorest among us will still be uninsured, with few options to rectify the situation. I still believe that few states will choose to refuse the expansion money. It's hard to say no to a full funding of insurance for millions of constituents when it will cost you nothing. Moreover, it will be politically difficult to say no when so many other states are saying yes. There will also be enormous pressure from physicians, hospitals and other providers, who stand to lose a ton of money if people aren't insured. Let's remember that there were holdouts when Medicaid was passed decades ago. Today, threatening to take away that program is ""coercive."" That said, plenty of states have shown their willingness to turn down such deals in the past. Likely, some will in the future. They are certainly threatening to already. Since those threats are nothing more than words at the moment, I'd take them with a grain of salt. But that doesn't mean a few won't hold fast. There are ways to fix this, of course. Subsidies could be provided for everyone, for instance. States could ask for new deals. Or the federal government could make the expansion a federal burden for all time. The various solutions will cost money and require compromise. That's not happening soon. So, for the moment, we will wait. On November 7, we will have a better idea of whether the Affordable Care Act will stand. And maybe then, we'll be able to get to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: It's not true that Medicaid is a universal health care program for all poor people .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona came from behind to beat arch-rivals Real Madrid 3-2 in the Nou Camp in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Thursday. Spanish champions Real took a 55th minute lead when Cristiano Ronaldo headed home from a Mesut Ozil corner, but their lead lasted just a minute as Pedro equalized for the home side. The game had come to life in the second half and both sides had good opportunities before Lionel Messi scored from the penalty spot after Sergio Ramos had pulled down Andres Iniesta. Spain star Iniesta then set away his midfield partner Xavi to score Barcelona's third. A comfortable two-goal advantage seemed enough to set the seal on a great night for the Catalan giants. But they were undone five minutes from time when their goalkeeper Victor Valdes tried to take the ball around Angel Di Maria, lost possession and gifted the Argentine an open goal. It means Barcelona will take only a slender lead into the second leg in the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium next Wednesday. ""One of our aims was to score in the Nou Camp, that goal from Di Maria changed everything,"" Real captain Iker Casillas told the club's official website. New Barca coach Tito Vilanova refused to blame his goalkeeper. ""We asked him to do that. If he boots the ball down the field we wouldn't have any semblance of a passing style of play,"" said Vilanova. ""During these years he's given us a lot and he's helped us build our play up from the back. ""The result isn't definitive for either side.

"London (CNN) -- The Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Olympics may not be until Friday, but for some athletes, the Games begin Wednesday. British women take to the soccer field against New Zealand in Cardiff, Wales, the first of six women's soccer games around Britain Wednesday. Women from the United States, France, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Cameroon, South Africa, Sweden, Colombia and North Korea are all in action on what Games organizers are calling ""Day -2."" Organizers got good news Wednesday morning, as border staff who had been planning to go on strike Thursday over job cuts called off the plan. London drivers, meanwhile, got bad news, as traffic restrictions went into effect. They're banned from special ""Olympics Lanes"" reserved for athletes and officials, and face a Â£130 ($200) fine for using them. Read more: How to avoid London Olympic rush . The city's transportation agency, Transport for London, reported moderate traffic problems Wednesday morning as the rules went into effect. While Britain's wettest June in more than a century may have cast a cloud over the final preparations for the Games, forecasters say the weather is now set to brighten. More than 10,000 athletes from 205 countries are assembling in London for Friday's Opening Ceremony. Every country will have at least one female athlete after Saudi Arabia included two women in its team for the first time, setting an important precedent for women's rights in the kingdom. And with medals to be handed out in 26 different sports, there's always the chance of a shock upset or the emergence of a shining new talent to captivate the crowds. Much of the cost of staging the Olympic and Paralympic Games has been met by British taxpayers, with the government overseeing Â£9.3 billion ($14.5 billion) of spending from the public purse. Read more: London prepares for an Olympics to remember . According to its figures, the Games are currently under budget by some Â£476 million ($738 million). London's Metropolitan Police Service, known as the Met, is undertaking what it says is its biggest-ever peacetime operation, running for 66 days across 1,000 venues, including sporting and cultural events, and making use of up to 9,500 police officers on the busiest days. The government is deploying 18,200 troops -- many more than planned after private security contractor G4S announced it could not provide the 10,400 guards for which it had been contracted. The Ministry of Defence is guarding the games with two warships, Typhoon jet fighters, Puma helicopters, and, perhaps most controversially, surface-to-air missiles placed on apartment buildings near the stadium, despite objections from residents.

"(CNN) -- While honoring a group of servicemen last night, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met a very special little guest. Looking at ease, Prince William gazed adoringly at three-week-old Hugo Eric Scott as he spoke to his father, Sgt Paul 'Vic' Vicary, a serviceman who had taken part in an expedition to the South Pole. Vicary's wife Hanna asked the Duke if he would like to hold the baby and William happily obliged, calmly cradling the newborn dressed in a 'superbaby' outfit. Later, his wife, Kate also met little Hugo and spoke animatedly with his proud parents. She described him as ""very cute,"" Vicary later told CNN's royal correspondent, Max Foster. After meeting the royal couple, Hugo's father said the second-in-line to the throne seemed like a natural and joked that he might call on Prince William if he ever needs a babysitter. The event held at Goldsmiths' Hall in London marked the return of the soldiers who had recreated the well-known Scott-Amundsen race to the South Pole one hundred years ago. The expedition, of which the Duke of Cambridge is the patron, was in aid of the British Royal Legion. The royal couple has had a busy year since their marriage almost one year ago. While Kate becomes used to life as a member of the royal family, joining the Queen for special events, Prince William has been kept busy by his RAF commitments. Most recently having been stationed for six weeks in the Falkland Islands.","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet servicemen returning from South Pole .

"San Diego (CNN) -- They're baaaaack. With apologies to Mark Twain, it seems that rumors of the death of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party were greatly exaggerated. In fact, I probably wrote that obituary myself, more than once. That's how it looked in 2000, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, lost the presidency to Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, or PAN. It seemed even more certain in 2006, when the PRI came in a distant third in the presidential election among the three major parties, behind both the conservative PAN and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, known as PRD. It seemed that the PRI, which controlled the presidency for 71 years and became synonymous with violence and corruption, was on the road to extinction. But the party has made a comeback. As expected, the top vote getter in Mexico's presidential election on Sunday was PRI candidate Enrique Peña Nieto. The 45-year-old former governor of Mexico's most populous state, the one with the matinee idol good looks and the movie star wife, got about 38% of the vote. PRD candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador came in second with about 32%. The PAN's Josefina Vazquez Mota got just 25%. This is despite the fact that Peña Nieto's public image took a lot of hits during the campaign. In December, the candidate struggled at a literary fair to name three books that had influenced him. When he was criticized for the flub by the country's intelligentsia, his daughter poured gasoline on the fire by insisting, on Twitter, that the story was driven by class envy. Later, in an interview with a Spanish newspaper, Peña Nieto admitted that he didn't know the price of a package of tortillas. When criticized for being out of touch, he insisted chauvinistically that he wasn't ""the woman of the household."" He also admitted in another interview that he was unfaithful to his late wife and fathered two children with two women during his marriage. These tidbits normally tantalize the media. But Mexico's version of Big Media, led by the gargantuan multimedia company Grupo Televisa, has been a big fan of Peña Nieto. Their cozy relationship was one of the things that, in recent weeks, drove hundreds of thousands of student protesters into the streets to protest the candidate's likely election and the fact that the elites who run Mexico seemed to be ramrodding Peña Nieto into office. The 132 Movement is Mexico's liberal version of the tea party, challenging the establishment and determined to be heard. Even former President Vicente Fox crossed party lines and endorsed Peña Nieto, against the PAN's own candidate, Vazquez Mota. That maneuver only solidified the cynical view of many Mexicans that the fix was in, and that the two major parties are more alike than different. Still, many voters fell in line. Now, after 12 years of being on the outside, the PRI-istas are back in power. Not that they were ever far from it. At various times in the last decade, even when it didn't hold the presidency, the PRI kept control of the Mexican Congress. The party also used this control to thwart reforms pushed by Fox and his successor, Felipe Calderon. As many Mexicans see it, the PRI was always plotting its retaking of the presidency, even as it overhauled its brand and tried to overcome a legacy of corruption. Has that legacy been overcome? It's hard to say. Some Mexicans seem willing to believe that this is not their father's PRI and that the party of today bears no resemblance to the one that was run from office a dozen years ago. But the more common view seems to be that, despite the makeover, the party is as corrupt as ever -- a fact that voters seem willing to overlook if it can steer the country to safer and more tranquil waters. Judging from what they're telling reporters, Mexicans are looking for a leader to grow the economy, turn Mexico into a first-world country, and, most of all, stop a war with the drug cartels that has in the last 5½ years resulted in the deaths of more than 50,000 Mexicans. That is the PRI's promise. The party racked up major victories in the 2009 midterm elections by insisting that it could provide prosperity and security. That's code for: ""Elect us, and we'll stop the drug war."" But can it deliver? I doubt it. What started nearly six years ago as an offensive by the government against the drug cartels has now morphed into a messy turf war between rival gangs eager to gobble up the country one city at a time. My sense is that the PRI couldn't stop the war, even if it wanted to. Besides, if you listen to what Peña Nieto has been saying in the last several weeks about combating drug violence, it sounds like what the Mexican people typically hear from Calderon. Consequently, most experts don't expect a dramatic shift in the drug war or how the government goes about fighting it. Shortly after winning, Peña Nieto told the Financial Times that while he is committed to reducing the violence, ""There will be no pact or truce with organized crime."" For those of us who believe that this is a righteous cause and a battle worth fighting, one that affects countless lives on both sides of the border, that's good news. Meanwhile, we'll have to wait and see whether the election of Peña Nieto turns out to be good news for Mexico. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- The searchers search, even when they fear that they may fail. A child is gone, under suspicious circumstances, and the searchers fan out, listening for a cry, a rustling in the underbrush, the sight of a colorful piece of clothing. Sometimes it is law-enforcement personnel doing the searching; sometimes it is citizen volunteers. In the end, the distinction doesn't matter. The searchers are members of a community, connected by their humanity, and there is an intrinsic dread in what they do. They pray for the best and try to prepare themselves for the worst. ""Some people here have gone out and looked on their own,"" said John Miller, the editor of the Hickory, North Carolina, Daily Record. ""Even for police officers, it is not an easy thing to do. Many of them are fathers and mothers themselves. And the child who is missing here is not just a little girl, but a little girl with a disability."" Hickory is the town where 10-year-old Zahra Clare Baker was reported missing October 9 by her father and her stepmother. The child, recovering from bone cancer, wore a prosthetic leg, and was in need of hearing aids in both ears. The search for the child began immediately. ""There was a sense of empathy, and urgency,"" Miller said. The searchers knew that the girl had little hope of fending successfully for herself. So when the police soon announced that they considered the case a homicide investigation, and when they arrested the stepmother on charges of obstruction of justice for allegedly writing a bogus ransom note, the searchers would have had a right to feel cruelly betrayed. The father, too, was arrested, on charges unrelated to the girl's disappearance: writing worthless checks, failure to return rental property. The search for the child continued. It takes a lot to make searchers give up. Last week they found a prosthetic leg discarded in some brush near a house where the stepmother once lived. What makes the searchers do it? For some, of course, it is part of the job. But that doesn't render it any less wrenching. The searchers know that at the bottom of every gully, behind every tree, they may come upon a cause for utter elation -- a frightened child waiting to be found -- or a cause for utter despair: a lifeless boy or girl. Which makes it all the more appalling when parents murder, and then send the community out to search for a child they say is lost or missing. Perhaps the most notorious case was the one involving Susan Smith, who, in 1994, told police in South Carolina that she had been carjacked, and that the criminal had driven away with her sons Michael, 3, and Alexander, 14 months. For nine days searchers looked frantically for the children. In the end, Smith admitted she had killed them -- that she had let her car roll into a lake with the children strapped inside. And had then begged the searchers to go out and find her purportedly kidnapped sons. ""I think searchers are so willing to do it because they think, 'What if it was my child?' "" said Lt. Garret Atkin of the Layton, Utah, Police Department. ""You have to go on the assumption that you are being given a straight story, and that the child is out there hoping to be found."" Layton is the town to which, earlier this year, Ethan Stacy, 4, was sent on a divorce-court order from rural Virginia, where he lived with his father, to spend the summer with his mother and her boyfriend. Within two weeks, the mother called police to say that Ethan had wandered away from the house in the middle of the night. So the searchers went out. The weather was foul -- cold post-midnight temperatures, rain, sleet, mud. They knew that if the child were to have a chance, they would have to find him quickly. ""You have to realize, especially in weather like that, that as the hours pass, the chances of a child being all right diminish,"" Atkin said. ""We wanted to find him and bring him home."" They found him the next day -- in a crude shallow grave on Powder Mountain, his scalded body wrapped in garbage bags, his face smashed by a hammer. Police and prosecutors say the boyfriend killed the child, and then the couple made up the story of him wandering away. They say the couple sent the compassionate searchers to look for a boy who they knew was already dead and buried. Atkin, talking about the case the other day, said that when a child is reported missing, searchers have no choice but to believe the report is genuine, and that the child is out there waiting to be rescued. ""When you go out, you have to do it filled with hope,"" he said. There is great joy and relief when a search is successful, and a child is found. ""A lot of times, it turns out well,"" said Lt. Mary Lindstrand of the Multnomah County, Oregon, Sheriff's Department. ""When a child gets separated from his or her parents, and the searchers find the child -- that's a great feeling."" But Multnomah County is where a search for a child who has been missing since June is still going on. Kyron Horman, 7, disappeared from Skyline Elementary School almost five months ago. Law-enforcement officials have made no arrests and have named no suspects. ""There is an emotional trauma to going out and searching for a child,"" Lindstrand said. We spoke soon after more than 100 searchers on a wet and soggy recent weekend looked anew for Kyron on Sauvie Island. ""There is no way to emotionally prepare yourself for what you might find,"" she said. ""You try to stay hopeful. When you are looking for a child who is missing, you don't just look for the child himself. You are given a description of what he was wearing when he was last seen. You're looking for a scrap of clothing -- anything."" Searchers, she said, do all they can to keep their own spirits, and optimism, as buoyant as possible. But it's hard to do. ""A child is gone,"" she said. ""The pain of that is so terrible that the searchers begin to feel it physically. You just keep looking, no matter what."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene writes about the difficult task of searching for missing children .
He says sometimes parents pretend kids are missing when they know what happened .
There's no way to prepare for the emotional difficulty involved in the search, he says .
Searchers can experience elation if they save a child -- or despair if it's too late ."
"(CNN) -- The United Nations chief warned international donors Sunday not to put complex reform demands on Afghanistan as it seeks billions in aid, saying the country was at a critical stage in its development. Concerns over widespread corruption in Afghanistan have overshadowed recent efforts to raise reconstruction and development aid to help Afghans maintain fragile economic and social gains as U.S.-led NATO troops withdraw from the country. ""We must be fully conscious that Afghan institutions are still in their nascent stages,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told representatives of more than 80 nations and organizations attending an aid conference in Tokyo. ""The very programs which offer the best hope of sustainability of Afghan institutions should not be held hostage to complex preconditions."" The Afghan Central Bank estimates that at least $6 billion a year is needed over the next decade in economic investment in the country, which the World Bank describes as one of the 10 poorest in the world. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said about $16 billion was pledged for Afghanistan over four years by donors at the conference, though the amount did not include money from the United States because any foreign aid must be approved by Congress. ""The United States will request from our Congress assistance for Afghanistan at or near the levels of the past decade through the year 2017,"" she said in remarks. The United States has spent roughly $18.8 billion spent in aid to Afghanistan over the past decade, more than to any other country. Weariness over the decade-long war in Afghanistan and a global economic downturn are raising questions about whether donors will commit to large handouts over the next decade without substantial, substantive reform in Afghanistan. At the meeting, Afghan President Hamid Karzai vowed the government was taking reform steps. ""I recognize, ladies and gentlemen, the success of our developing partnership will depend on our mutual ability to be accountable, and to prove our practices so the hard-earned dollars of your taxpayers are used effectively and transparently,"" Karzai said. But Karzai has made promises of government reform before with little result. A majority of corruption cases have failed to yield prosecutions, and U.S. officials have said some of those investigated had close ties to Karzai. Poverty and corruption are widespread in Afghanistan. It came in 172nd out of 187 countries in the United Nations' 2011 Human Development Index, which ranks nations based on life expectancy, education and living standards. Video: Taliban shoot woman 9 times in public execution as men cheer . Questions were raised after the United Nations announced an investigation in June into its Afghanistan development fund that pays the salaries of Afghan police amid allegations of misuse of funds. That same month, before the Afghan parliament, Karzai called for new government reforms and accountability. ""President Karzai has made a strong public commitment to stamping corruption, implementing key reforms, and building Afghanistan's institutions,"" Clinton said. ""We will support him and the government in that endeavor to enable Afghanistan to move toward self-reliance and away from dependence on donor assistance."" Karzai told potential donors in Tokyo that Afghanistan's economy remains underdeveloped, its private sector was ""embryonic"" and its vast natural resources were largely untapped. ""Today, I request Afghanistan's friends and partners reassure the Afghan people that you will be with us as we seek to strengthen Afghanistan as a peaceful, democratic and self-reliant country,"" he said during prepared remarks. ""And to translate your commitments into tangible actions."" Clinton said she was pleased by the $16 billion in pledges, calling it ""sustained economic support that will help Afghanistan meet its fiscal needs even as assistance declines."" Under a security pact with Afghanistan, nearly all U.S.-led NATO troops will withdraw from the country by the end of 2014. The donations in development aid are in addition to more than $4 billion a year between 2015 and 2017 pledged by NATO allies in May to pay for the growth and training of Afghan security forces. Taking place on the side at the meeting were anticipated three-way talks between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States. In earlier comments, Clinton said there would be a meeting on the ""ministerial level"" between three countries. Karzai and Clinton arrived at the Tokyo meeting a day after the secretary made a visit to Kabul where she announced the United States was naming Afghanistan a major non-NATO ally. The relationship is beneficial during the transition as both nations prepare for post-2014, according to Clinton. By granting such ally status, it makes Afghanistan eligible to receive military training and assistance, including expediting the sales and leasing of military equipment long after NATO troops leave. Afghanistan joins Japan, Pakistan, Egypt, Israel and Australia, among others, granted major non-NATO ally status by the United States. Unlike NATO allies of the United States, who are bound together by a joint defense pact, there is no mutual defense guarantee as a non-NATO ally. Roadside bombs kill dozens in Afghanistan .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Paulette Beale shakes her head at the suggestion, then flashes a contagious smile. ""It's still history,"" she says, to rebut the notion there could be less intensity for President Barack Obama in the African-American community the second time around. ""The first history was that he won. The second history's that he won twice. So, it's not just about history the first time, you have to be concerned about the history for the next four years also. You can make history more than one time, you know."" Her mother and father stand a few feet away, nodding approvingly. Paul and Altermese Beale founded Paul Beale's Florist 41 years ago. Paulette takes the lead now, but her parents are on hand helping most days in a shop that is an institution in the Ogontz Avenue area of North Philadelphia. ""We love him,"" Altermese Beale says of Obama. ""One of the proudest days of my life was the day he was elected."" The Beales are determined to see the president re-elected, and are part of an Obama campaign ground operation that is active early because of several obstacles to generating the big African-American turnout that was critical to then-Sen. Obama's 2008 victories in many of the major presidential battlegrounds, Pennsylvania among them. Our visit this week was timed to coincide with the president's speech to the National Urban League. At that meeting, in New Orleans, a major topic of discussion is a new Urban League study suggesting that if African-American turnout in 2012 falls back to 2004 levels, then Obama is almost certain to lose North Carolina and would find things much tougher in a handful of other battlegrounds, including Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. In 2008, just shy of 65% of eligible African-Americans voted for president; in 2004 it was 60%. That prospect of lower turnout could change the math in some key battlegrounds even if the president runs roughly equal to his share of the African-American vote, an eye-popping 95% in 2008. There are a number of reasons the Obama campaign worries that turnout among its most loyal voters could slip some -- and we got a taste of all of them during our visit to Philadelphia: . • Economy: African-American unemployment is well above the national average. • History: The prospect of electing the country's first African-American president was unquestionably a factor in the 2008 turnout boost. • Complacency: The president's win in Pennsylvania was by 9 points, and Republicans have not carried the state in a presidential race since 1988. • New voter ID laws: Pennsylvania is among the states with a new requirement that voters show photo identification on Election Day. Paul Beale scowls at the mention of the law. ""There are people who don't want him as president and they are trying to suppress the vote,"" he says. Altermese Beale says some of her elderly friends don't have driver's licenses or other current photo identification. ""If they keep this law, we will be in bad shape,"" she says. The Beales ask every customer if they are registered to vote, and have forms and literature on hand for those who need help. Across the street at the Obama campaign field office -- one of six in Philadelphia -- a table just inside the door is stacked with literature about the new law and its requirements. The campaign's networking with local businesses is part of an unprecedented effort to register and then keep in contact with African-American voters. Danny Wright is a natural fit. A 67-year-old with vivid memories of taking part in civil rights marches in his native Maryland and now the owner of Danny's Auto Tags, which contracts with the state to issue driver's licenses and also sells auto insurance. ""It's like a spark,"" Wright told us during our afternoon visit. ""When you say, 'Obama,' everybody is very, very enthusiastic about him and you will see each person say to the other person, 'Have you registered to vote?' "" The new ID law is also a hot topic of conversation. Many fiercely oppose it. Wright is in that group, but says he has to assume it will stay on the books through November. ""You hear a lot of talk about suppression,"" he says. ""Everyone is making sure they're having the proper ID and everything to go vote. So we reinforce this also."" Our walk through the neighborhood -- steamy temperature aside -- had more of an October feel than late July; campaign volunteers were everywhere, asking passersby if they are registered to vote and collaring most of those who answered no. One of the local Obama turnout teams has met regularly since the 2008 campaign. Most of the others took shape beginning a year ago. One older volunteer says his only worry is that so many people tell him, ""Don't worry, Pennsylvania is a can't-lose.' "" Bruce Burton has a quick answer when visitors to his Pretty Boyz barber shop sound complacent about the president's November odds. ""We have more at stake,"" Burton said. ""We're either going back to the years of President Bush or we're going to keep moving forward. ... We have voter registration forms in the back. We are recruiting as many people as possible. We are not feeling that this is a sure bet. We feel we have to stand behind him 100%."" Black clergy is always critical to voter turnout in communities like this, and Dr. Kevin R. Johnson says Obama can count on his help despite a disagreement over the president's support for same-sex marriage. ""We understand that he is not the pastor of the United States of America -- he is the president of the United States,"" said Johnson, the senior pastor at Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church. After services this past Sunday, Bright Hope congregants had a chance to get materials on the new voter ID law. Johnson says that law could be one factor in driving African-American turnout down a bit from 2008. But if there is a significant drop, his bet is that the tough economy will be the driving force. ""The president could do more in that area,"" Johnson said. ""When you look at the unemployment rate in the African-American community, there's more that can be done."" Still, Johnson says things are a bit improved in recent months, and as he tells congregants they must vote, he also says he is banking on a little help in this tougher election climate. ""The reason I know that everything is going to be all right in November is because I trust in the Lord,"" Johnson said. ""I love the president. But I trust in the Lord.""","Turnout among African-Americans could determine result of presidential election .

"Washington (CNN) -- Late last week, the leaders and finance ministers of the 20 biggest economies, the G-20, met in Cannes for their annual media extravaganza. Surprise, surprise, the G-20 summit failed to allay anxieties about Greece -- and has left the whole world anxious that Italy might be the next Euro country to plunge into crisis. As usual, it's very hard to see what could possibly be accomplished in an unwieldy format like this. Taxpayers confronting the enormous cost must wonder: How on earth did this event ever come into being anyway? A bit of history: . Thirty-five years ago, a president of France had a very good idea: . In the mid-1970s, the Western world faced the first serious economic crisis since World War II: a spike in the price of oil that had sparked record unemployment and unusual inflation. Cooperation between the big economies was necessary. Unfortunately, the new leaders of the Western world did not know each other as well personally as had the great postwar generation of Eisenhower, DeGaulle, Adenauer and so on. Yes, the leaders encountered each other at the U.N. General Assembly and other big useless crushes. And yes, sometimes they scheduled bilateral meetings to discuss particular pieces of business. But wouldn't it be nice if the leaders could just regularly sit down for a sequence of informal talk, no particular agenda, just get-to-know-you, hear what's on your mind? Accordingly, President Valery Giscard D'Estaing proposed a new kind of summit for the leaders of the world's six largest economies: two days at a location outside a capital city, to be followed by a bland communique that sent the message: ""If we told you what we discussed at our confidential talks, then they would not be confidential talks, would they?"" The first meeting was held at Rambouillet, some 25 miles outside of Paris. By all accounts, the meeting was a great success. No, the leaders did not overcome their economic challenges. But they built new relationships, so much so that four leaders in particular remained close friends for the rest of their lives: D'Estaing, U.S. President Gerald Ford, German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and British Prime Minister James Callaghan. The small summit was recognized as so useful that it quickly evolved into a permanent institution. Yet almost as soon as the institution was created, it began -- as international institutions so often do -- to bloat from useful innovation into useless behemoth. The Rambouillet meeting in November 1975 was followed by a meeting in Dorado, Puerto Rico, in June 1976. At the behest of the United States, Canada was added to the group, which thus became known as the G-7. (The other six countries, by the way, were the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Italy.) The Canadian addition was an excellent innovation. Not so what happened the next year. In retaliation for the addition of Canada -- opposed by France, which was then engaged in a grudge match with Canada over independence for the French-speaking province of Quebec -- the French demanded and got the addition of the president of the EU Commission at the third meeting, in London in 1978. As the meetings became a fixture on the annual calendar, the agenda for the meetings began to fill. The number of aides in attendance grew. The press coverage escalated: hundreds of journalists converged on the 1988 meeting in Toronto. With so many TV cameras eager for video, political entrepreneurs inevitably materialized to provide the video the cameras needed: counter-summits, political demonstrations, and so on. Three thousand protesters convened in Toronto. Security costs escalated correspondingly: to a then-astounding $30 million. Toronto 1988 was noteworthy as the last of the Cold War summits. As the world moved into a new political era, the G-7 summit elephantized in earnest. In 1996, the leaders of the UN, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization were added. In 1997, Russia joined the group, now renamed the G-8 - despite the awkward fact that the Russian economy had shrunk to approximately the size of that of the Netherlands. The Russian addition raised the question: If Russia, why not China? And what's with the whole ""largest economies"" thing anyway? Isn't that kind of ... stuck-up? To respond to that concern, a new forum was created in 1999: a meeting of the finance ministers of the 20 largest economies, called (you guessed it) the G-20. During the financial crisis of 2008, the US urged a summit of the heads of government of the G-20. What was intended as an emergency summit instantly congealed into a recurring gathering, held in the late fall after the G-8 meetings of mid-summer. If the G-20 was intended to thwart demands for ever huger expansion of the G-8 - it failed. Beginning with the Okinawa summit hosted by Japan in 2000, five poor countries were added to the G-8 guest list: South Africa was included as a permanent invitee, along with four rotating slots for countries like Senegal and Algeria. And if you were already adding poor countries, shouldn't we add agencies that address poor country concerns? In 2000, the World Health Organization gained attendance rights too. The 2001 meeting in Genoa, Italy, was stage-managed by Italy's showman prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. He accommodated most of the leaders on luxury cruise ships in Genoa harbor to isolate them from the violent protesters on the mainland. Total costs for the summit were now soaring toward and then past the quarter-billion mark. In 2003, China and India were added as temporary members: the group was now being called the G-8+5. The G-8+5 format quickly broke down however. At the 2004 meeting in Sea Island, Georgia, the United States invited 13 additional countries (plus of course all those international organizations). Over successive years, additional international organizations would be added to the roster: the African Union, UNESCO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the League of Arab States. In 2010, Canada hosted the G-8 summit of world leaders (in the rural setting of Huntsville, Ontario), at the same time as the G-20 finance ministers met in downtown Toronto. For the first time, costs pass the $1 billion mark mostly due to higher security expenses. But this experiment in folding the G-8 (plus 5!) into the G-20 failed. The two massive entities retained their distinctness, each separately growing bigger, costlier, and progressively more useless. At the 2010 G-8 meeting, France proposed junking the G-8+5 format for a permanent G-14 format: the core seven, plus Russia, plus China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and 1 Muslim country, so nobody will feel left out. That idea looks likely to be adopted in time for the 2013 meeting in the United Kingdom. By which point of course the original purpose of the meeting will have been lost under the layers of accreted uselessness. So sources close to David Cameron are reporting that the young British prime minister has had a brainwave: Now that the G-8 has swelled into a grandiose nightmare mobile U.N. General Assembly -- now that the G-8 is evolving into a group very nearly identical to the G-20 -- why not just junk the G-14 or merge it with the U.N. General Assembly (which would amount to the same thing as junking it)? Then the leaders of Britain and other major countries could organize amongst themselves some informal talks, no particular agenda, just get-to-know-you, hear what's on your mind ... Coming up soon: the new G-30! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","In mid-1970s, French president proposed informal meeting of leaders from six nations .

"(CNN) -- After four nights of rioting, the Anaheim was calm Wednesday night as federal authorities agreed to examine police shootings in the city, including one Saturday that sparked the protests. ""We are aware of the concerns in the city of Anaheim and will review the recent incidents to determine whether a federal civil rights inquiry is warranted,"" said spokeswoman Laura Eimiller with the FBI's Los Angeles field office. No inquiry has been opened yet, she said. Police shot and killed two men in Anaheim over the weekend, but it was Saturday afternoon's shooting of Manuel Diaz, 25, whom police described as a gang member, that sparked an immediate angry reaction from bystanders. Days of raucous protest and confrontations with police followed. Police and an attorney for the Diaz family have both said that he was unarmed at the time of the shooting, though police say he was throwing objects at the officers. The second shooting occurred Sunday, after a man officers were pursuing in a car theft case allegedly opened fire on police. They returned fire, killing him. Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait said Wednesday that he asked the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles to investigate both shootings, but said violent protests ""will simply not be tolerated in our city."" ""When the investigations are concluded, we will have a clear and complete understanding of these incidents,"" Tait said. ""At that time, we will have additional public dialogue about any actions that need to be taken. ... We will not, however, accept any violent protests, vandalism or arson perpetrated under the guise of public protest."" On Tuesday, demonstrators disrupted a city council's meeting at the Anaheim City Hall, less than a mile and a half north of Disneyland, the city's most famous tourist attraction. Eyewitness video: Rioters clash with police . Protesters blocked access to the building, forcing a delay in the session as police moved to clear emergency exits, Police Chief John Welter said. The protest moved to downtown streets, where demonstrators blocked a major intersection and refused to move, Welter said. ""After allowing the crowd to protest for a couple of hours, the violence escalated to the point where an unlawful assembly was declared and the streets were then cleared of protesters,"" he said. Welter said officers made 24 arrests. Anaheim Police Sgt. Bob Dunn told CNN's ""Newsroom"" that once the protest was broken up, ""the crowds kind of moved around, sometimes fighting between each other, breaking windows and lighting fires and trash cans."" Also Tuesday, the Diaz family filed a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit against the city and the police department seeking $50 million in damages. The family cites witnesses who say Diaz was talking with two friends around 4 p.m. Saturday when a police car drove up with lights on ""and an intent to confront the young men."" Diaz responded ""instinctively when he saw people chasing him and began to run,"" they say in the suit. The suit, filed in state court, says police shot the unarmed Diaz in the back and that when he fell, they shot him in the head and killed him. ""There is a racial and economic component to this shooting,"" said Dana Douglas, an attorney for the family. ""Police don't roust white kids in affluent neighborhoods who are just having a conversation. And those kids have no reason to fear police. But young men with brown skin in poor neighborhoods do. They are targeted by police, and something as simple as a friendly conversation is deemed 'suspicious activity' by police."" Cell phone video taken at the scene of the incident and posted to YouTube showed police ordering bystanders to back away from the man lying face down on a lawn before they cordoned off the area with yellow police tape. Dozens of people surrounded the police officers; some threw objects at them and rolled a burning trash bin in their direction, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. Police responded with rubber bullets and pepper spray. One demonstrator showed the television news station bruises she said she got from rubber bullets fired at the crowd. The next day, protesters jammed the police department to complain about shootings involving police officers. But later the same night -- in a separate incident -- police shot and killed a second man, whom they also considered a gang member, when he allegedly fired at police, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Monday, hundreds held a vigil for Diaz, chanting in Spanish, according to KTLA. Dunn, the police sargeant said, said the Diaz shooting took place when officers in the ""high-crime gang neighborhood"" attempted to stop three men, who ran off. ""It was during that foot pursuit that the officer-involved shooting occurred,"" he said. ""The circumstances surrounding that shooting are under investigation by the district's attorney. Police in Anaheim were involved in six shootings in 2012, all but one of which were fatal, according to KTLA.","The FBI will review the shootings to assess whether a civil rights inquiry is warranted .

"Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- McKayla Hicks sat in the courtroom Monday and stared at the man accused of a shooting spree that left her with a bullet in her jaw, killed a dozen people, and traumatized a community. ""I saw him and he's just this freak lookin' dude with some orange hair,"" the 17-year-old high school student said, calling suspect James Holmes ""pathetic looking."" ""You could feel in the room all the anger that everyone had for him,"" she said. ""Everyone in America hates this guy."" She wants him to get the death penalty. ""He tried to kill people,"" Hicks said. ""So I think he needs to be killed."" Hicks was in the theater next door to the one in which a gunman opened fire at a midnight showing of the new Batman movie on Friday in Aurora. Why did suspect avoid social media? One of the bullets -- she thinks it was early in the shooting spree -- pierced the wall and entered the theater she was in, slashing through her mouth and becoming lodged in her jaw. It will stay there forever, in the lower left part of her jaw. Doctors tell her that removing it would cause too much nerve damage. ""I like the idea. I think it's cool that I have a bullet in my chin,"" she said with a smile, calling it ""a souvenir."" She considers herself lucky to be alive, and not injured worse. Lori Schafer helped save her that night, and was in court with her Monday. ""It made it hit home,"" she said. ""It wasn't just a picture on the TV anymore."" ""I just want him to be where he's never going to be able to hurt someone again."" Opinion: Mass murder and powerful guns . Hicks said that when she was shot, she didn't know what had happened. She started bleeding, but ""thought someone had thrown something at me. And when I got up to leave the theater everyone else was still sitting down. So I was really upset, like, 'Who's personally doing this to me?' "" ""Then we saw the victims from Theater Nine -- and I realized it wasn't just me."" Schafer, who will begin college in the fall, helped her out of the building, pulled a fire alarm, called 911, and helped get Hicks seated outside on a curb. It was only then that she touched her face and realized there was a bullet in her. ""It changed me as a person,"" she said, adding, ""I just don't take people for granted -- especially the ones that save your life."" ""Being in a real life-or-death situation,"" she said, helped her realize that ""the little things don't matter. It shows you what really does matter.""","Shooting victim McKayla Hicks went to hearing for accused killer James Holmes .

"(CNN) -- It is one place where they wish that business wasn't booming. ""Our numbers are way up this year, I'm sad to say,"" said Francine Nichols, of Moberly, Missouri. Nichols is the staff member in charge of the program at Moberly's three elementary schools that, each Friday, quietly provides food that will get children through the weekend. Some of you may have read the report in this column last November that explained the program, and the heart-wrenching need for it. In Moberly, as in many school districts, free or reduced-priced breakfasts and lunches are served during the week to children whose families have hit rough economic times. But school officials in Moberly had noticed that some children were coming to school hungry on Monday mornings. There hadn't been enough food in their homes to feed them on Saturdays and Sundays -- or the parents, for whatever reason, had not been around to prepare meals. So the backpack program was initiated. Using empty backpacks donated by local merchants, Nichols and volunteers at the Moberly elementary schools loaded the packs with enough food to get the boys and girls through the weekends. The backpacks were left in the school hallways by the end of the day on Fridays; the idea was that the children who needed them could pick them up to take home and not be embarrassed. The backpacks filled with food looked no different from the regular backpacks that children stored in the hallways between classes -- the hungry children could unobtrusively sling them over their shoulders and not feel a stigma about needing the help. We are always reading reports about fluctuations in the national economy. The numbers can be confusing and contradictory. Are things getting a little better? Are there new downturns? The figures coming out of Washington and Wall Street are sometimes difficult for those of us who are not financial experts to decipher. So, as Thanksgiving approaches this year, I thought I'd check back in Moberly. Last year I was told that 106 children needed the backpacks full of donated food to make it through the weekends. Moberly is just one small town in rural Missouri, but I thought by asking if that number had gone down, or up, or had stayed about the same, it could provide a different kind of indicator of how the economy is doing in daily-life terms. I was hoping that the number of families whose elementary-school children didn't have enough food on the weekends had markedly dropped, signifying that good economic times were reappearing. ""The number has more than doubled,"" Francine Nichols said. ""From the 106 children last year, it has grown to 287."" She knows the families who are in the program. The parents have to apply in order for the children to discreetly be provided the weekly backpacks of food. ""We've had people apply who tell us that they've never had to do anything like this before,"" Nichols said. ""They never thought that they'd be having to ask for help."" She, like the rest of us, has read the occasional optimistic story about the economy bouncing back. ""I'd like to think it was happening,"" she said, ""but we're seeing the opposite here. It takes a long time for a positive change in the economy to reach the people on the bottom. For the people we are asked to help, things have been bad for so long that they will be the last to feel the effects of any recovery."" Why has the number of children needing food for the weekends increased so dramatically? ""People who were just hanging on by their fingernails last year can't hang on any more,"" she said. ""We have families who have had to buddy-up on their homes -- they may have had their own homes, but now two and three families are living in one home, to share expenses. People who were too proud to ask for help have said that now they have to swallow their pride and say they can't make it on their own. They say that it's more important to make sure their kids get fed."" At the Central Missouri Food Bank in Columbia, Missouri, which provides much of the food for the backpack program in Moberly's schools, the executive director, Peggy Kirkpatrick, said that Nichols's observations were accurate, and that the continuing hard times are not limited to Moberly. ""I've been doing this for eighteen-and-a-half years,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""I have never seen the need so high."" At this time last year, she said, her food bank was providing help to 3,700 children at 80 schools in her part of Missouri. This year, she said, the number is 6,300 children in 112 schools. ""We always felt we were recession-proof around here,"" she said. After all, Missouri is part of America's breadbasket. ""But whatever recovery there is hasn't gotten to the heartland yet."" She said a man came in recently who had at one time been a donor to her food bank. ""He dropped his head,"" she said. ""He said, 'I have been giving to your program for years. But I haven't had a job for 18 months. I'm here as a last resort to ask for your help. I need to feed my kids.'"" In Moberly, the superintendent of schools, Mark Penny, told me that his fondest dream would be if the number of children requiring the backpacks of food each Friday would drop to zero. ""It really affects the learning environment when a child comes to school so hungry after the weekend,"" he said. ""How can you concentrate on trying to learn when your mind is on where your next meal is coming from?"" So, as another Thanksgiving approaches, the efforts go on. I asked Peggy Kirkpatrick how she and her staff at the food bank deal with the continuing need. ""You're asking a lady who prays all the time,"" she said. ""I believe that God will provide, and I believe in the goodness of people."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Children whose families need food are helped discreetly in Moberly, Missouri .

"(CNN) -- It may not be the coughing, sneezing passenger next to you on your next flight who is spreading disease, it could be the airport you just took off from. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Civil and Environmental Engineering department looked at the 40 largest U.S. airports and figured out which ones would be the most likely to spread a disease in the event of an outbreak in the cities they serve. They factored in passengers' travel patterns, the airports' geographic locations, interactions between airports and even passenger waiting times for their study, published July 19 in the journal PLoS ONE. One of the surprises in their findings was that an airport's ranking on the researchers' list was not necessarily tied to its size or busyness. While John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Los Angeles International Airport were first and second on the list, respectively, Honolulu International Airport ranked third, even though it carries only 30% as much traffic as Kennedy. The researchers said that's because of Honolulu's place in the air transportation network: in the Pacific Ocean, with many connections to distant, large, and well-connected hubs. Though Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport ranks first in the number of flights, it was eighth on the researchers' list of potential disease spreaders. Boston Logan International Airport ranked 15th. Following Kennedy, Los Angeles and Honolulu on the list are San Francisco International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and Washington Dulles International Airport. Atlanta, Miami International Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport round out the top 10. Public health crises of the past decade, like SARS in 2003 or the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, have highlighted how easy it is for diseases to spread around the world, including through air travel. But existing models, the researchers said, look only at the final stages of an epidemic and the places that ultimately develop the highest infection rates. The researchers say the new model can help determine ways to contain an infection in a specific area, and can also help public health officials made decisions about treatment and vaccines in the early days of a contagion. ""We are currently capable of modeling with some detail real disease outbreaks, but we are less effective when it comes to identifying new countermeasures to minimize the impact of an emerging disease,"" said Prof. Yamir Moreno of the University of Zaragoza, who studies complex networks and spreading patterns of epidemics. ""The work done by the MIT team paves the way to find new containment strategies"" because it allows a better understanding of the patterns characterizing the initial stages of a disease outbreak, he said in a comment on the research. The SARS outbreak spread to 37 countries and caused about 1,000 deaths. The H1N1 ""swine flu"" pandemic killed about 300,000 people worldwide.","The list measures how likely airports are to spread diseases in an outbreak .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's ruling military council Tuesday expressed ""great regret"" to Egyptian women over recent attacks on female demonstrators by military police and vowed to hold accountable those responsible. Days of clashes around Cairo's Tahrir Square were stoked by the weekend beating of a woman by military police officers, prompting a ""Million Women"" march on Tuesday. In a statement issued on its Facebook page, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces called for calm and said it is willing to discuss any proposal ""that might help in achieving stability and safety for Egypt."" ""The Supreme Council express its great regret to the great women of Egypt for the violations that took place during the recent events, in the demonstrations that took place at the parliament and the ministers' council, and reassure its respect and appreciation for Egyptian women and their right in protesting and their active positive participation in the political life,"" it said. The statement added, ""All legal measures have been taken to hold accountable all those responsible for these violations."" Egypt's capital remained engulfed in tension Tuesday as security forces and protesters clashed and demonstrators at the ""Million Women"" march railed against the regime and assaults on citizens. Meanwhile, Egypt's capital remained engulfed in tension as security forces wielding batons, firearms and tear gas attacked defiant protesters Tuesday on the fifth consecutive day of clashes the square, witnesses told CNN. Sherif Barakat, a businessman, heard machine gun fire early in the morning and saw the unrest from the balcony of his home above Tahrir Square. He saw security forces charge, firing tear gas and beating people with batons. ""Both sides exchanged rock-pelting until the military withdrew,"" he said. ""They kept the protesters at bay far from the epicenter of the clashes at Sheikh Rihan Street close to the Ministry of Interior for two hours until they reinforced the cement wall erected two days back with more blocks, then they withdrew."" Nazly Hussein, an activist, said the forces stormed the square before dawn with a ""startling"" amount of firepower. ""I noticed protesters are not too scared of the firepower,"" Hussein said. But at the same time, ""they are terrified from getting caught and tortured."" Ahmed Hamdi, a field medic, claimed that two people -- a doctor and a student -- were shot and killed. But Adel Al Dawi, a Health Ministry spokesman, could not confirm the casualties. ""It usually takes several hours before we get the official casualty report from the morgues or the hospitals. I know of five people who suffered gunshot wounds during the attack and were transferred to hospitals,"" Al Dawi said. Demonstrators and security forces have been battling since Friday in Tahrir, the epicenter of the uprising that brought down Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak earlier this year. At least 14 deaths in the latest spate of violence were confirmed as of Monday. Several hundred women kicked off the ""Million Woman"" march, billed to highlight regime violence against female demonstrators. It started in Tahrir Square, moved through nearby streets and grew to as many as 1,500 to 2,000 people, both men and women outraged over the treatment of all protesters. Many held up pictures of abused people, and called for regime change. Men vigilant about assaults formed a protective ring around the female marchers. ""I am here to violently condemn the attacks on Egyptian men and women by the Egyptian Army,"" said Ragia Omran, a human rights activist at the march. ""We will not be quiet. We will not let this happen again and we will continue to voice out our anger against this military junta that is killing this country."" The march occurred as shocking images of brutality that went viral across the Internet intensified the crisis in Egypt, the world's most populous Arab nation. One video that sparked outrage showed a military police officer stomping on a woman's exposed stomach over the weekend. Protesters on Tuesday held placards with images of that woman. Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, released a statement Monday condemning what she called ""vicious"" and ""brutal"" assaults recorded over the weekend. ""The ruthless violence being used against unarmed women protesters is especially shocking and cannot be left unpunished,"" Pillay said. Another video showed Islam Abdel Hafiz, a boy allegedly shot by the military. Field medics attempted to remove the bullet from his motionless bleeding body before transferring him to the hospital. Al Dawi said he visited the boy in the operating room and met his parents. ""I hope he survives, as the bullet seems to have caused some serious internal damage,"" Al Dawi told CNN. Protesters are now demanding that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces swiftly hand authority over to an elected civilian government. Egypt has been conducting parliamentary elections and the military has said it plans to transfer power after elections are completed next year. There have already been two rounds of voting for the lower house of Parliament, and voting for the upper house will begin at the end of January and go into early March. There are plans for the election of a president in June. Newly elected Parliament members, intellectuals and academics weighed in on the violence Monday. The 40 demonstrators held a sit-in in front of the Supreme Court. They demanded that officials involved in the killing of protesters be tried, and they called for the military to hand over authority to civilians on January 25, the anniversary of the Egyptian revolution. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Revolutionary Alliance, an opposition bloc of secular and religious parties, held a news conference to display images and testimonials about the violence, an event that served as a refutation of a Monday news briefing by the military. The alliance has not taken part in the election. ""Our press conference challenges the press conference announced by the military yesterday which was an utter joke, with all the blatant lies and fabrications it contained. That presser displayed their arrogance and continued mismanagement of the interim period that has led us to the crisis of witnessing dead people everyday,"" said alliance member Rami Shath. The military displayed videos of young boys who confessed that they received money from men who asked them to throw Molotov cocktails and rocks at security forces and burn government buildings such as the Cabinet. Many journalists attending the news conference applauded Gen. Adel Amar after his speech. ""The military fabricated these videos and forced the young boys to give these testimonials. They also invited local military correspondents loyal to the establishment that were seen clapping away after the press conference, which was broadcast live on state TV. It is a propaganda move to bury the revolution and portray us as paid thugs with no political horizon,"" Shath added. Activists have filed complaints about senior government officials to the Egyptian prosecutor's office. Adel Saeed, the official spokesman of the general prosecutor, told CNN that two judges from the appeals court have been appointed to investigate the ""intricate details"" of the clashes and file a report to the prosecutor and the Justice Ministry. ""There are protesters and activists dying every day,"" Noor Noor, the son of presidential candidate Ayman Nour, told CNN Tuesday. The son filed a report under his own name against Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, commander-in-chief of the armed forces. ""Someone has to be accountable. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has failed to govern the interim period on both the military and political level,"" Noor said. Monday was the fourth day that pro-democracy demonstrators battled Egyptian security forces. The United Nations' Pillay said she believes the individuals involved in the assaults must be arrested and prosecuted. ""These are life-threatening and inhuman acts that cannot possibly be justified under the guise of restoration of security or crowd control,"" Pillay said. She called for an impartial and independent investigation into ""all instances of abuse and violent repression against protesters.""","NEW: Egypt's military expresses ""great regret"" to women over the violence .

"(CNN) -- If you should find yourself visiting New York -- or even if New York is where you live -- there is a place I'd like to recommend that you stop by. It won't cost you a penny, yet in its near-silence it offers a priceless perspective on the shrill, gossip-drenched, celebrity-saturated world that surrounds us. News of glitz and glamour bombards us 24 hours a day: on our computers, on our television sets, in our newspapers and magazines, on the screens of our telephones. A movie star gets in a jam, a singer fails a drug test, a sports star is named in a divorce proceeding -- there is an entire industry devoted to telling us about it, and it is an industry that never sleeps. The roar is constant and deafening. Which is why there is value in spending a few minutes at 3 E. 53rd Street in Manhattan. It's a hole in the city -- a slender rectangular space between New York buildings. It is a park, commissioned more than 40 years ago by William S. Paley, who was the pioneering chief executive of CBS, and named to honor his father, Samuel. It has a soothing waterfall, and trees and flowers, and white metal tables and chairs for anyone who wishes to find a moment of tranquility in a hectic world. It's free; it is a privately owned park, but the public is welcome. And the lesson it teaches is one that you will miss unless you know what used to be there. That modest-looking little sliced-out space on 53rd Street once housed a structure that loomed as symbolically large and loud in the nation's consciousness as a thousand big-band dance orchestras, as a million high-budget movie premieres. Before there were internet entertainment-news sites, before there were nightly television shows dedicated to reporting on stars and who they date and what they wear, the building at 3 E. 53rd was the epicenter of what is now referred to as buzz. It was the Stork Club: the single American structure that most epitomized fame. The Stork Club was the capital of celebrity. It was the brick-and-mortar incarnation of what it meant to make it to the top. From 1934, when the Stork Club moved to 53rd Street after brief forays at other Manhattan locations, to 1965, when it finally breathed its last, it was the most sought-after nightclub in the world. Frank Sinatra would dine and drink there, as would Grace Kelly; John F. Kennedy was a customer, as were Marilyn Monroe and Ernest Hemingway. Mobster Frank Costello was at home at the Stork Club, but so was FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Elizabeth Taylor, Joe DiMaggio, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor ... you get the picture. The Stork Club's owner, Sherman Billingsley, had his doormen guard the entrance not with a mere velvet rope, but with a 24-karat gold chain. But that doesn't explain the hold that the Stork Club had on the American imagination, or why it became the embodiment of stardom. The answer to that can be summed up in two words: Walter Winchell. Take every entertainment writer, broadcaster, magazine editor and web site purveyor in today's star-soaked culture, combine their impact, and they don't add up to Winchell's reach at the peak of his power. How vast was that reach? Neal Gabler, in his superlative 1994 biography of Winchell, estimated that out of an adult U.S. population of 75 million during the prime Winchell years, 50 million either listened to his Sunday night radio broadcast or read his column, which was syndicated to more than 2,000 newspapers. Winchell's friend and attorney Ernest Cuneo put the number even higher; he estimated that nine out of every 10 American adults either read or heard Winchell every week. It was often said that, on warm summer Sunday nights, you did not need to own a radio to hear Winchell -- all you had to do was walk down the street and listen to his voice wafting out of all the open windows. And Winchell's headquarters was the Stork Club. From his seat at Table 50 in the nightclub's Cub Room, he allowed the world of show-business grasping to come to him. The fighting that went on in the Stork Club was not usually conventional fisticuffs; the backstabbing did not involve literal knives. But what went on in there was akin to climbing a slippery pyramid. What table a person was assigned to in the Stork Club (assuming he or she even got in the front door), who he or she was seen dancing with (often to a tune the orchestra called ""The Walter Winchell Rhumba"") was a major determinant of national status and prestige. Shining at the Stork Club, and currying favor with Winchell, was a job in itself, to be undertaken with fierce and single-minded resolve. The stars did just that; the process may have been superficial and it may have been tacky -- and it certainly was a queasy precursor to the celebrity-worshiping universe that is a part of the very air around us today -- but what went on at the Stork Club, as disseminated to the nation by Winchell, made that building the most desired after-dark destination in the country. Not that most Americans ever had a chance of stepping inside; that address on 53rd Street was the hottest of the hot, the most exclusive of the exclusionary. Which is why going there today -- spending a quiet half hour in Paley Park -- can be such a calming experience. All heat eventually cools; that which was coveted drifts away. The Stork Club fell out of fashion by the time the 1960s arrived, and when it closed its doors for the last time in 1965 and was then demolished, the spotlight-craving crowds had long since moved elsewhere. Winchell has been dead since 1972, his home newspaper, the New York Mirror, having expired a decade before he did. It's doubtful that many people, walking briskly along 53rd, pause to consider that the slim, boxy space leading to the waterfall on the back wall was once a magnet for desperate attention-seeking and strident clamor. Take a walk into the tiny park, should you be in Manhattan. Listen to the bottoms of your shoes click against the cobblestones. Pull up a chair at one of the tables. Everyone is welcome; there is no pecking order. When you get close enough to the waterfall, the sounds of the city disappear. Where once there was mad commotion and frenzied striving, all of it seemingly so urgent, there is now a stillness steeped in serenity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Before celebrity websites and cable channels, there was a home for celebrity culture in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Yemen will swear in its new president Saturday, cementing a power transfer deal reached in November to end months of protests and violence over outgoing leader Ali Abdullah Saleh's longtime rule. Abdurabu Mansur Hadi -- who served as Saleh's vice president and then became acting president in November in an agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council -- is expected to be sworn in Saturday in front of Yemen's parliament. On Monday, a formal inauguration will take place in Sanaa -- one that Saleh is expected to attend. A spokesman for the country's embassy in Washington said late Friday that the president has returned home, after a short U.S. visit for medical treatment. ""As of Saturday morning, Hadi will be Yemen's president and the inauguration on Monday will only be ceremonial and a celebration in support for Yemen's new leader,"" said Abdul Aziz Jubari, a member of Yemen's parliament from Saleh's General People's Congress party. Hadi received 99.8% of the 6.6 million votes cast in Tuesday's election, according to Mohmmad Hassan al-Hakimi, chairman of the Supreme Committee for Elections and Referendum. Saleh was wounded in a June assassination attempt at his presidential palace during battles between government troops and tribal fighters. A ""massive celebration"" was being planned for Saleh, who will not necessarily disappear from Yemeni politics, said Abdu Ganadi, a senior Saleh aide. ""Saleh has the option to continue involvement in politics and the power transfer deal will not force him to step aside,"" Ganadi said. ""He is the leader of the GPC and his voice and support will continue being heard in the GPC."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the Yemeni election ""another important step forward in their democratic transition process."" Human Rights Watch has called on Hadi to make changes without delay. ""Yemen's potentially historic transition will be off to a shaky start unless Hadi makes an immediate break with the abuses of the past,"" said Letta Tayler, HRW's Yemen researcher. ""Yemen's new leader needs to move decisively to usher in promised reforms that uphold human rights and the rule of law."" The 65-year-old Hadi is a British-, Egyptian- and Soviet-trained army officer, recently promoted to field marshal. He had been vice president since 1994 and ran for a two-year term as president on pledges of improving security and creating jobs. But he's never had much of a power base, and Yemen's problems are expected to take longer than two years to fix. Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East, with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million. Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in the north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- Supporters and opponents of Lebanon's pro-Western government appeared to split seats on Sunday as Lebanese voters went to the polls to replace two ruling-party lawmakers assassinated in recent months. Lebanese women wait in line to cast their votes in Beirut. Voters in Beirut sent pro-government candidate Mohammed al-Amin Itani to parliament to replace Walid Eido, who was killed in a June bombing. Both Eido, a Sunni Muslim, and Itani are members of the bloc led by Saad Hariri -- the son of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose 2005 killing triggered Lebanon's current wave of political upheaval. But in Metn, a Maronite Christian suburb east of the capital, anti-government candidate Camille Khouri upset former President Amin Gemayel by a few hundred votes, Lebanese television network LBC reported. Khouri is a member of the Free Patriotic Movement, the anti-government party led by former Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Aoun. Aoun has said he will run for president of Lebanon -- and since the post is chosen by members of parliament, Sunday's results were closely watched. Gemayel was seeking the seat held by his son Pierre, who served as industry minister in the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora before being gunned down in his car in November 2006. He served as president from 1982 to 1988, during the civil war in Lebanon. His brother, Bashir Gemayel, was elected president in 1982 but was assassinated before he could take office. Eido and Gemayel were among several Lebanese political figures killed since the February 2005 killing of the elder Hariri. All were critical of Syria's influence in Lebanon, and their supporters blamed Damascus for their deaths -- allegations the Syrians and their allies in Lebanon denied. Hariri's killing triggered a wave of protests against Syria known as the ""Cedar Revolution,"" which brought Siniora's government to power and forced Syria to withdraw the garrison it kept in Lebanon for three decades.

"(CNN) -- As one of the first four female lawmakers ever elected to Kuwait's parliament, Aseel al-Awadhi knows she has a tough road ahead in the conservative Gulf state's male-dominated legislature. Rola Dashti is one of four women who won parliamentary seats in the recent elections in Kuwait. Still, victory is sweet. ""Even before the results, people were piling up to congratulate me either from my own district or from other districts,"" al-Awadhi, a university instructor, told CNN Sunday. ""I think that shows you the tremendous amount of support for women's role in politics,"" she said. ""And I think today I can confidently say that [the] gender issue is history in Kuwait -- I mean, regarding women's role in politics."" Men have filled the seats of Kuwait's parliament for nearly five decades, and it was only four years ago that the country granted women the right to vote and run for office.  Watch new lawmaker discuss historic win » . But, despite failed attempts in the past two elections, four women -- al-Awadhi, Rola Dashti, Salwa al-Jassar and Masouma al-Mubarak -- won parliamentary seats in Saturday's general elections. ""The Kuwaiti women have been able to notch up this great victory at a crucial time and set a precedent in the history of Arabian Gulf parliaments,"" Mohammad Al-Feili, a constitutional law professor at Kuwait University, told the official Kuwait News Agency. Two-hundred-and-ten candidates ran for 50 seats in the general election; 16 were women. Al-Awadhi said the elections proved Kuwaitis want political change. ""Yes, they do, absolutely,"" she said. ""Yes, I mean, this is my second time running for election. I ran last time ... and yes, people were talking about change. But this time, I realized that people are determined -- that they want to achieve change, they want to see change happen."" The elections were called after the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, dissolved parliament, which is made up mostly of opposition politicians. He said he was dissolving parliament to put an end to a crisis that had paralyzed decision-making. The parliament had been locked in a feud with the government, which it accuses of corruption and abuse of power. It has been pressuring the government for the right to question ministers on deals. ""We don't mean changing the ruling system -- we mean change within the parliament,"" al-Awadhi told CNN. ""Because the parliament has been dominated by certain political groups for years and years. ... Their representation is intense, and their agenda also has been dominating the parliament agenda. ""So I think, when people speak about change, they need change and shifting the attention towards people's needs and desires. And most of the parliament members during the last several years were not attending to people's needs and desires. The parliament is made up of elected lawmakers, but ministers are appointed.

"(CNN) -- After years of challenging doping accusations -- and two days after giving up that fight -- Lance Armstrong said Saturday that he has no worries and, in fact, feels ""more at ease now than I have in 10 years."" The native Texan has long been one of the dominant forces in the cycling world, including amassing an unprecedented seven Tour de France titles. But his championship legacy, as well as those prestigious wins, may now be history after Armstrong announced Thursday that he would not participate in what he called a ""one-sided and unfair"" process to challenge doping charges brought against him by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. The famed cyclist's decision prompted the USADA to ban the 40-year-old athlete from competition and strip him of his wins dating to 1998, though there is a question of whether the organization has the authority to take such action. Your top Armstrong questions answered . Speaking publicly for the first time since announcing his position in a statement, prompting the USADA response, Armstrong insisted he had no worries and was happy and ""focused on the future."" ""I don't have anything to worry about,"" he told reporters before Saturday's start of the two-day Power of Four Mountain Bike Race in Aspen, Colorado. ""I've got five great kids, I've got a great lady in my life. I've got a wonderful foundation that is completely unaffected by any noise out there and we're going to continue to do our job,"" Armstrong said, referring to his namesake charity that supports cancer patients and research. In February 2011, Armstrong announced his retirement from professional cycling, though he continued to compete in triathlon events. Then, in June of this year, the USADA said it had filed doping charges against the cyclist -- accusations his attorney blasted as ""wrong"" and ""baseless,"" much like Armstrong has vehemently denied other such claims in the past. The USADA, a quasi-government agency recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sports in the United States, accused Armstrong of using, possessing, trafficking and giving to others performance-enhancing drugs, as well as covering up doping violations. What's behind the Armstrong headlines? ""It is a sad day for all of us who love sport and our athletic heroes,"" U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement Thursday after Armstrong announced he would no longer cooperate with the agency. ""This is a heartbreaking example of how the win-at-all costs culture of sport, if left unchecked, will overtake fair, safe and honest competition, but for clean athletes, it is a reassuring reminder that there is hope for future generations to compete on a level playing field without the use of performance-enhancing drugs."" Armstrong has called Tygart's investigation an ""unconstitutional witch hunt."" But on Saturday, he made no mention of him, the USADA or performance-enhancing drugs. Rather, the athlete said he felt ""pretty good"" and said it felt ""great to be out here."" As to the public's reaction to his decision, Armstrong said that he believes they understand and accept his rationale -- including his desire to focus on other things besides fighting doping allegations. ""I think people understand that we've got a lot of stuff to do going forward,"" he said. ""That's what I'm focused on, and I think people are supportive of that.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- From behind a wood and plastic partition, the Israeli soldier who drove a bulldozer that crushed an American peace activist to death testified publicly for the first time Thursday. Rachel Corrie was killed seven years ago. But the driver's identity has never been revealed and he was not charged after a  month-long Israeli investigation found that no Israeli soldier was to blame. Her parents have searched for answers in their daughter's killing. Was it intentional? Who was accountable? On Thursday, they finally heard from the man who was responsible. He acknowledged he was driving the bulldozer, according to Stacy Sullivan, spokeswoman for the Corrie family who was in the Haifa courtroom. He said he was aware there were protesters in the area -- he had been ordered to work carefully. He said over and over again that he did not see Rachel Corrie before he struck her; that there was a pile of rubble impeding his vision. He showed no remorse, Sullivan said. The soldier, who was born in the Soviet Union and arrived in Israel in 1995, was testifying in a civil suit filed by Corrie's parents against the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Corrie's parents cannot take him to court because the Israeli Supreme Court has upheld a decision to shield him. ""We feel deeply disappointed that somehow the state of Israel feels that our being able to see the faces of these people and their body language, that some how that poses a threat to the soldiers,"" said Rachel's mother, Cindy Corrie. In March 2003, Rachel Corrie was working with the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement. She was among protesters who were attempting to prevent the Israeli military from tearing down Palestinian homes when she was killed. The Ministry of Defense said Thursday that it regrets Corrie's death. ""But she was in a known combat area so the [Israeli Defense Forces] does not have responsibility,"" a spokesman told CNN. ""The case is with the court and they will make their decision."" Craig Corrie said he doesn't necessarily want to see the driver sent to jail. ""The more we found out, the more likely that the killing was intentional, or at least incredibly reckless,"" he said. ""And, as a former soldier, I was even in charge of bulldozers in Vietnam ... You're responsible to know what's in front of that blade, and I believe that they did."" Craig Corrie said the soldiers, too, are victims. He does not view them with disdain. ""So I'm not full of hatred for this person, but it was a horrendous act to kill my daughter, and I hope he understands that.""

""For some time, I've been talking with (Turner Chairman and CEO) Phil Kent about wanting to make a change, and he supports my decision,"" Walton wrote in a memo to employees. In a brief interview, Walton said that he timed his announcement to give Kent the opportunity to find a successor and ""be open about it."" ""It's a well-run place now,"" Walton said.

"(CNN) -- Recovery efforts on Alaska's Mount McKinley were suspended Sunday because of environmental hazards following an avalanche thought to have killed four Japanese climbers, the National Park Service said. The avalanche on the western side of the mountain, America's highest peak, was first thought to have occurred on Thursday, the parks service said Sunday. However, rangers later confirmed with climber Hitoshi Ogi, who survived the avalanche, and with teams on the mountain that the slide occurred early Wednesday. The section where the avalanche took place is roughly 11,800 feet above sea level, park spokeswoman Maureen McLaughlin said Saturday. The five were traveling on McKinley's West Buttress as one rope team, although the rope broke during the incident, officials said. One climber, Ogi, survived the incident after he was swept into a mountain crevasse and was able to climb out, sustaining a minor hand injury, officials said. Ogi, 69, was unable to locate his fellow climbers and descended solo to the Kahiltna Basecamp, where he reported the event, according to the park service. An aerial search took place Thursday, and an initial four-member ground search took place Friday, the park service said. On Saturday, a 10-person crew including rangers, volunteer patrol members, a dog handler and a rescue dog investigated the debris zone left by the avalanche. ""During the search, NPS mountaineering ranger Tucker Chenoweth descended into the same crevasse that the survivor Hitoshi Ogi had fallen into during the avalanche,"" the parks service said. ""While probing through the debris roughly 30 meters below the glacier surface, Chenoweth found a broken rope"" matching the Japanese team's rope. He attempted to dig further ""but encountered heavily compacted ice and snow debris,"" officials said. ""Due to the danger of ice fall within the crevasse, it was decided to permanently suspend the recovery efforts."" Male climbers Yoshiaki Kato, 64, and Tamao Suzuki, 63, and female climbers Masako Suda, 50, and Michiko Suzuki, 56, of the Miyagi Workers Alpine Federation expedition are all presumed to have died in the avalanche, the park service said. The climbers, on their registration forms, indicated their experience included climbing peaks in Africa and Asia, but not McKinley, McLaughlin said. Four die on Mount Everest . Named after William McKinley, the 25th president of the United States, the mountain's summit reaches an elevation of 20,320 feet above sea level. The mountain is also known as Denali, an indigenous name meaning ""the high one."" The debris path was about 800 feet long and 200 feet wide, officials said. It was in an area where avalanches are known to occur, but not of this magnitude. There have been six climbing fatalities on Mount McKinley this season, the parks service said. The four Japanese fatalities were the first to occur on the West Buttress route. In May, a climber died after falling more than 1,000 feet down McKinley's north face. The climber apparently tried to recover a backpack that had started to slide downhill before falling, the park service reported. That fatality was considered McKinley's first serious incident of the 2012 mountaineering season. Less than a week later, a 36-year-old Finnish mountaineer also died from injuries sustained in a fall during descent. Since 1932, a total of 120 climbers have died on Mount McKinley, according to the park service. The Japanese consulate in Anchorage has been in contact with the families and assisted in translating conversations with Ogi.

"Washington (CNN) -- Gaby Pacheco calls herself an aspiring U.S. citizen who is compiling the paperwork and trying to get the $465 needed to apply for a two-year reprieve from getting deported. James D. Doebler says his superiors at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are threatening to suspend him for putting an arrested illegal immigrant into the hearing process that could lead to deportation. The two are on opposite sides of a lawsuit filed this week by Doebler and nine other ICE agents that challenges a new Obama administration policy intended to remove the threat of deportation faced by young illegal immigrants who arrived in America as children and have good student or military records. Doebler and his fellow complainants argue the new policy on immigration law enforcement exceeds the administration's authority and puts ICE agents in the position of facing disciplinary action for doing their jobs. ""They're in a position now that's just untenable,"" argued Roy Beck of NumbersUSA, an advocacy group for more restrictive immigration that is bankrolling the lawsuit. The goal of the lawsuit is to force a court ruling on whether the new administration policy is legal, Beck told CNN on Friday. If so, then the ICE agents are protected; and if not, the case would halt what the former journalist called a harmful influx of illegal workers at a time when young Americans are struggling to find jobs. ""Obviously, we would not be pleased if they say this is a legal order,"" Beck said, adding: ""We do believe strongly that the president doesn't have the right to do this."" Pacheco and others reject the premise of the lawsuit, calling it a politically motivated effort to undermine the ""deferred action"" directive by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that went into full effect last week. ""I think they're using this as a political plan to rally the voters in election season,"" said Pacheco, the political director of United We Dream, an advocacy group for young illegal immigrants like herself. A statement by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said the lawsuit lacked a sound legal basis, noting that ""over 100 of the nation's top constitutional and immigration law scholars signed on to a letter"" attesting to the constitutionality of the new administration policy. Trumka's statement added that the suing agents ""are working with some of the most anti-immigrant forces in the country; forces that have long sowed division and destruction."" The agents are represented by Kris Kobach, the Republican Kansas secretary of state who worked on Arizona's controversial immigration law and is an informal adviser to presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, according to NumbersUSA. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Friday that the lawsuit lacked legal merit. ""I can't imagine any judge would even give them standing to file the case, much less decide it on the merits,"" Toobin said. ""I am unaware of any law that allows federal employees to challenge the legality of the actions of their superiors."" Filed Thursday in federal court in Dallas, the lawsuit challenges the two-year deferred action policy of the Obama administration, as well the policy of ""prosecutorial discretion,"" in which ICE agents are supposed to focus their attention on dangerous criminals who are illegal immigrants. In a nutshell, the agents involved do not want to obey the new policies and do not want to face any disciplinary actions or lawsuits if they continue to arrest any type of immigrant who is in the United States illegally. ""We are federal law enforcement officers who are being ordered to break the law,"" said Chris Crane, one of the agents filing suit and the president of the ICE agents and officers union. ""This directive puts ICE agents and officers in a horrible position."" According to the lawsuit, Doebler ""arrested an alien who was unlawfully present in the United States and issued the alien an NTA (notice to appear), contrary to the general directions of his supervisors that he should decline to issue NTAs to certain illegal aliens."" ""Plaintiff Doebler was issued a Notice of Proposed Suspension,"" the lawsuit says. ""Plaintiff Doebler is facing a three-day suspension for arresting and processing the alien for a hearing rather than exercising the 'prosecutorial discretion' commanded by his supervisors. Plaintiff Doebler requested a written directive ordering him not to issue the NTA. His supervisors have refused to give him a written directive and would not sign any paperwork authorizing the use of 'prosecutorial discretion.' "" Now, the lawsuit says, Doebler ""reasonably fears, based on his past experience, that if he follows the requirements of federal law, contrary to the 'Directive,' and arrests an alien or issues the alien an NTA, he will be disciplined again. He reasonably fears that a second disciplinary action will result in the loss of his job."" Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, responded Thursday that the department ""uses prosecutorial discretion to assist in focusing vigorously on the removal of individuals who are convicted criminals, repeat immigration law violators, and recent border-crossers."" In fiscal year 2011, ICE removed 216,000 criminal illegal immigrants, Chandler said, adding that it was the largest annual figure in history and an 89% increase over the administration of President George W. Bush. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals decision is a temporary measure until Congress takes action on reforming immigration policies, Chandler continued, adding that it ""ensures that responsible young people, who are Americans in every way but on paper, have an opportunity to remain in the country and make their fullest contribution."" Pacheco, who came to America with her parents from Ecuador at the age of 8, described herself in similar terms. She graduated from Miami Dade College and now wants to get a master's degree, she said. ""We speak the language. We are part of the fabric of this nation,"" she said. ""This is my home. They are telling me that I do not belong, that I am not American."" President Barack Obama made a similar point in announcing the policy change in June, calling the decision to halt deportations of people like Pacheco ""the right thing to do."" Under the new policy, the Obama administration will give a two-year deferral from deportation to illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they are younger than 30, arrived in the country before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military. Supporters stress the plan does not grant immunity or provide a shortcut to citizenship, but instead affords undocumented immigrant children a chance to be productive workers while removing the threat of deportation for two years. Opponents say the policy amounts to granting backdoor amnesty to people who came to America illegally and tightening an already poor job market for young Americans. As many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. The deferred deportation policy includes some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that failed to win enough Republican support to become law. Obama made clear that the new policy was intended to be a temporary step until Congress passes a more comprehensive immigration law that addresses the situation of young illegal immigrants who have essentially grown up as Americans. Beck called such an approach misguided. ""We're going to do something that's not allowed by law in order to get Congress to pass something which they have defeated repeatedly,"" he said. ""It's just such an abuse of power."" His group raised $100,000 for the lawsuit Thursday, Beck said, adding that he expected the case to cost ""a few hundred thousand dollars."" ""If it goes to the Supreme Court, who knows?"" he added.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's administrative court suspended the country's 100-member constitutional assembly on Tuesday delaying the drafting of the new constitution. The move stalls Egypt's attempt to rebuild after the revolt that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak last year. The court order stated that parliament must elect 100 ""qualified"" people from outside the parliament to write the constitution. A newly created assembly must include members representative of Egypt's ""political and social map"" according to the court order. Lawsuits were brought against the former panel stating that it did not reflect the diversity of the Egyptian society and was highly dominated by Islamists who have won the majority of the parliament seats. Egyptians took to the streets for weeks protesting last month's choice of the former panel fearing that Islamists would draft a constitution that follows strict Islamic rules. Al-Azhar Institution, one of the most influential Islamic entities and the Egyptian Coptic Orthodox Church had also objected to the assembly. Several liberal and secular members of the former constitution assembly had earlier withdrawn because of the criticism. Sameh Ashour, the head of the lawyer's syndicate, was one that withdrew days before the court order. ""The assembly was unrepresentative of Egyptians. Members of parliament will now decide on the criteria and conditions of the new members that they will elect accordingly,"" said Ashour. The disbanded group did not include a significant amount of women or young professionals. The new constitution was scheduled for completion before the presidential elections on May 23. Leading members of the Freedom and Justice Party released statements confirming their acceptance of the court order. ""Parliament will discuss tomorrow the new process of choosing the 100-Egyptians who will write the country's most important guide to governance so they must be careful in their choices and it must include constitutional lawyers and experts this time around,"" Ashour told CNN.","The new constitution was to be completed before the presidential elections on May 23 .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court handed down its first-ever sentence Tuesday, sending Thomas Lubanga -- the Congolese warlord convicted of using child soldiers and turning them into killers -- to prison for 14 years. But six years, from March 2006 until Tuesday, that Lubanga had been in custody will be deducted from the sentence, Judge Adrian Fulford at the court The Hague, Netherlands, said. Fulford said ""vulnerability of children mean that they need to be afforded particular protection that does not apply to the general population."" Warlords beyond Lubanga and Kony . Lubanga's cooperation with the court was one of the mitigating factors that the court considered during sentencing, he said. In March, the court convicted Lubanga of conscripting and enlisting children under age 15 and using them to participate in ""hostilities"" during a civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Prosecutors said Lubanga led a rebel force that recruited child soldiers. The violence occurred between 2002 and 2003 in the mineral-rich eastern part of the nation. Lubanga forced some of the child soldiers to serve in militia roles, including as his bodyguards, the court said. Former child soldiers testified that Lubanga recruited them to kill, rape and rob. Lubanga's case marked the ICC's first trial and first verdict since the court was established in 2002 to address offenses of international concern, such as genocide and war crimes. In recent months, the court has come under fierce criticism that it disburses justice selectively. Critics have said the court targets Africa and bypasses opportunities to investigate abuses in various nations, including Afghanistan and Iraq. The court currently has investigations in the Central African Republic, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Libya. Do war crimes trials really help victims?

"(CNN) -- A key part of the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage was struck down as unconstitutional by a U.S. appeals court Thursday. The Defense of Marriage Act -- known as DOMA -- defines marriage for federal purposes as unions exclusively between a man and woman. Same-sex couples find their stride on wedding day . At issue is whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry. The ruling is a boost for gay rights advocates and the Obama administration, which in a rare move, has refused to defend a federal law in court. ""If we are right in thinking that disparate impact on minority interests and federalism concerns both require somewhat more in this case than almost automatic deference to Congress' will, this statute fails that test,"" said the three judge panel. Same-sex marriage fast facts . The 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in Boston, did not rule on the federal law's other key provision: that states that do not allow same-sex marriages cannot be forced to recognize such unions performed in other states. Traditionally, marriages in one jurisdiction are considered valid across the country. DOMA was enacted in 1996, when Hawaii was considering legalizing same-sex marriage. Marriage between two males or two females is legal in the District of Columbia and six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York. It is set to become legal in Washington state next week and in Maryland in January, but in each state the implementation could be delayed by opponents placing the question on the November ballot. Many other states have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law. But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. Lesbian couple can file for divorce in Maryland, court rules . The appeals court said it recognizes how divisive the issue is, and noted it may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to decide. But this decision is the first at this judicial stage to find the heart of the law unconstitutional. ""Many Americans believe that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, and most Americans live in states where that is the law today,"" said Judge Michael Boudin, appointed to the bench in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush. ""One virtue of federalism is that it permits this diversity of governance based on local choice, but this applies as well to the states that have chosen to legalize same-sex marriage. Under current Supreme Court authority, Congress' denial of federal benefits to same-sex couples lawfully married in Massachusetts has not been adequately supported by any permissible federal interest."" Chief Judge Sandra Lynch, a Clinton nominee, and Judge Juan Torruella, a Reagan nominee, joined in the opinion. It is in effect only within states with gay marriage laws covered by the 1st Circuit -- Massachusetts and New Hampshire -- and has limited enforcement. That means there will be no immediate eligibility for financial benefits currently denied same-sex married couples. No change is likely until the high court decides the matter. Massachusetts had challenged Section 3 of the law on behalf of a group of seven couples. Similar lawsuits have been filed across the country. Couples challenge Illinois law denying same-sex marriage . DOMA is being officially defended in court by House Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who stepped in after the Justice Department refused to participate. The Obama administration announced last year it believed the law to be unconstitutional. A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA. Congressional opponents of DOMA hailed the court's opinion. ""It's very good new for those who are fighting discrimination in any place, including in the area of marriage equality,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The case was argued in Boston last month. The lawyer for the couples said states have long-standing authority to control and define marriage, and that Congress has no right to intervene through DOMA, clearly designed, said the lawyer, as ""disrespect"" to lesbians and gays. But Paul Clement, the private attorney hired by Boehner to defend the law, argued a congressionally mandated, uniform standard to define marriage for federal purposes is both proper and practical. Obama calls for marriage equality, says 'I want everyone to be treated fairly' Groups fighting DOMA were ecstatic at the decision. ""All Massachusetts couples should be afforded the same rights and protections under the law, and we hope that this decision will be the final step toward ensuring that equality for all,"" said the state's attorney general, Martha Coakley, who in 2009 filed the initial lawsuit challenging DOMA. ""As more loving same-sex couples commit their lives to one another in marriage, the harms of this unjust law become more clear,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, ""from service members, risking their lives to protect ours, being denied the ability to protect their own families through military medical insurance or survivor benefits, to senior citizens having to move out of their homes after their partners of many decades pass on because they cannot access Social Security protections afforded any other legally married couple."" There was no immediate reaction from Boehner or the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group in the House of Representatives. But gay marriage opponents expressed confidence the Supreme Court would eventually reverse the ruling. ""Society should protect and strengthen marriage, not undermine it,"" said Alliance Defense Fund Legal Counsel Dale Schowengerdt. ""In allowing one state to hold the federal government, and potentially other states, hostage to redefine marriage, the 1st Circuit attempts a bridge too far. Under this rationale, if just one state decided to accept polygamy, the federal government and perhaps other states would be forced to accept it, too."" The issue has been working along two legal tracks. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled against California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage, arguing the ban unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination. In a split decision, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the state's Proposition 8 ""works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians"" by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th Amendment. Both the California and Massachusetts cases could soon be presented to the U.S. Supreme Court for review. The justices would have the discretion to accept one, both, or neither case -- perhaps deferring judicial review until a later time, after more lower courts have had time to debate the matter. The case is Massachusetts v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services (10-2204).","At issue is whether federal benefits can be denied in marriages legal under state law .

"(CNN) -- When Dolley Madison swanned onto the Washington scene in pink satin and ermine in the early 19th century, she created a new role for first ladies. The president's wife could appear larger-than-life on the public stage, imparting emotional and psychological messages about her husband to the public. Our most famous first ladies were charismatic figures: Dolley Madison's message confirmed the Madison administration's legitimacy and authority; Eleanor Roosevelt helped Depression-weary Americans feel hopeful and virtuous; Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy showed the world that the Kennedys were a new breed of young, modern, cosmopolitan Americans. Our current first lady belongs to this tradition. Michelle Obama, dressed in J. Crew, with her little girls and career firmly in hand, assures us that people like us are in power. Opinion: Ann Romney did great, but won't move needle . Of course, many first ladies have preferred to remain in the background. Mamie Eisenhower famously insisted on remaining a largely domestic creature. Barbara Bush proudly eschewed the spotlight, while her daughter-in-law Laura -- perhaps one of the most productive recent first ladies -- did her work quietly and without a lot of fuss. Still, even the most modest of presidential wives can help a president or candidate seem more human and less a political machine. When Ann Romney mounted the platform at the Republican convention, she appeared to be a first lady wannabe of the second camp. She, too, is proudly domestic and puts herself outside politics. And she seems, well, like a perfectly nice woman -- the kind you'd like to have as a neighbor. When she began her speech, ""Tonight I want to talk to you from my heart about our hearts"" and ""Tonight I want to talk to you about love,"" it looked as if Ann Romney was about to tell her personal story in an effort to warm and fuzzy up her rather remote and stiff husband. One might say no candidate's wife has had so great an opportunity to make a difference. No matter if they support or decry Mitt Romney's politics, people generally agree that Romney doesn't always seem human, much less a beacon of compassion and empathy. But the need to make Mitt more personable is so great that, in planning Ann Romney's speech, his advisers may have overreached. After her initial talk about love, instead of relating personal anecdotes, she went on to address remarks to hardworking families and especially women ""who have to do a little more."" It seems her husband's handlers recognize that in addition to Mitt's personality, Republican policy needs warming up a little too. Can Mitt bring love and empathy to people who are struggling, even to people whose lives are so different from his own? Ann Romney had to humanize Mitt as the husband and father she trusts and whom we can trust. In that, she was on steady ground in telling her ""When Mitt Met Ann"" story, positively beaming when she spoke of being a wife and mother. Women in the hall clapped their hands off for that. But she was not in her element in her evocations of sighing mothers at the end of a hard day, in offering insights and empathy for women and families struggling to pay bills, to buy gas and food. That's too much for her to do. She has neither the personal nor the professional authority to talk about the difficulties of poor, working-class or even middle-class Americans. Opinion: Ann Romney stole the show on opening night . Her remark about women doing more, and doing it happily, is cringe-worthy: Does she know that with women making, at the best, about 80% of what men do, they have to do more just to break even? I understand Mitt Romney's advisers are in a tough position. Democrats are painting him as a heartless capitalist, ruthlessly firing and downsizing to make Bain Capital one more dollar. Even loyal Republicans, who will support Romney to the end, aren't excited about the guy. But don't put it all on Ann's shoulders. She can't be Dolley Madison and Mamie Eisenhower at the same time. No woman should have to work that hard. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Allgor.","Catherine Allgor: Ann Romney seems to be a political wife who is domestic and outside politics .
Allgor: Her speech was best when she tried to humanize her husband .
Allgor: But she tried to identify with the struggles of poor and middle class and shouldn't have .
Ann Romney can't relate to the poor or make GOP policy warm and fuzzy, Allgor writes ."
"(CNN) -- John Walker Lindh, who is serving a 20-year sentence for aiding the Taliban, testified in federal court Monday in Indianapolis in an attempt to overturn a prison ban that he says severely restricts Muslim prayer. Lindh spent more than two hours on the witness stand in a lawsuit he filed against the warden and the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, alleging the warden's ban on daily group prayer violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. ""He addressed his personal need to pray, to pray in congregation and how he was able to do it previously on the unit before it was stopped,"" Lindh lawyer Kenneth Falk said. ""Being forced to pray in his cell is not a satisfactory alternative."" The warden, according to court documents, has argued that the ban implemented after 2007 is necessary because of security concerns. The plaintiffs concluded their case Monday afternoon, but the government is expected to take at least another day to present its case. Falk said. Lindh, 31, is serving his sentence in Terre Haute's Communications Management Unit, which opened in 2006. The unit severely restricts the contact of prisoners with the outside and monitors conversations between the inmates. From the archives: Walker Lindh sentenced to 20 years . The unit has 55 cells, and the majority of the prisoners are Muslim, according to court documents. Also housed with Lindh, according to published reports, are members of the ""Lackawanna Six,"" a group of Yemeni-American friends who were convicted of providing material support to al Qaeda; Ali Asad Chandia, convicted of providing aid to a Pakistani terror organization; and Enaam Arnaout, who pleaded guilty to using donations to his charitable foundation to support fighters in Bosnia. At least five inmates, including Arnaout and Chandia, gave depositions in support of the lawsuit. Islam requires followers to answer a call to pray five times day. Depending on the religious teaching, the call could be required to be a group prayer. Part of Lindh's complaint alleges that before 2007, Muslim prisoners were allowed to pray together in the unit for at least three of Islam's five daily prayers. Since then, other than during the holy month of Ramadan, the prisoners are allowed to gather only once a week, according to court documents. The court filings also gave a glimpse inside the prison unit, describing it as ""an open unit, meaning that they have freedom to move around various places in the unit during the times they are not restricted in their cells."" Spate of attacks near Ramadan trouble U.S. Muslims . There is an area with a computer where they can send e-mail, a food services area with tables and a microwave, a lounge area with multiple televisions, a room with exercise equipment and a room with a washer and dryer, the records said. The warden, who was not identified by name in the records, implemented the ban after the Muslim prisoners, who were engaged in prayer, did not acknowledge a unit lockdown prompted by a fire alarm. The prisoners said they did not hear the lockdown because of a noisy fan. Lindh, who was born in California, converted to Islam as a teenager. He traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 and attended a terror training camp where he was introduced to Osama bin Laden. Lindh was captured by the Afghan Northern Alliance on November 25, 2001, and imprisoned in a compound in Mazar-e-Sharif, where he was questioned by CIA agent Johnny Michael Spann, who was killed in an uprising at the compound a short time later. As part of a deal, Lindh pleaded guilty to supplying services to the Taliban and carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony. His family filed a petition for clemency to commute the 20-year sentence, a request that was denied by President George W. Bush in one of his final acts in office.","NEW: John Walker Lindh, the so-called American Taliban, testifies Monday .

"(CNN) -- The key to understanding the tragedy that was Jonestown lies in the oratory skills of the Peoples Temple founder, Jim Jones. ""He was very charismatic,"" Leslie Wagner-Wilson, a Jonestown survivor, says of the Rev. Jim Jones. With the cadence and fervor of a Baptist preacher, the charm and folksiness of a country storyteller and the zeal and fury of a maniacal dictator, Jones exhorted his followers to a fever pitch, audiotapes recovered from Jonestown reveal. As he spoke, they applauded, shouted, cheered. One follower who survived the ""revolutionary suicide"" at Jonestown on November 18, 1978, said that Jones was the most dynamic speaker he had ever heard. Like all powerful speakers, Jones' greatest asset was his ability to determine what listeners wanted to hear and give it to them in simple language that appealed to them on an almost instinctual level. ""He was very charismatic, very charismatic,"" said Leslie Wilson, who survived that fateful day in Jonestown by walking away from the settlement before the cyanide that killed more than 900 Peoples Temple members was distributed. She was one of 33 people who began the day in Jonestown and lived to tell the tale. ""He could quote scripture and turn around and preach socialism,"" she said. ""He appealed to anyone on any level at any time.""  Hear Jones declare ""I am God"" » . Many of his followers were elderly African-Americans drawn to his cause by his soulful delivery and Pentecostal preaching style, including at times speaking in tongues. That hair-raising fervor was perhaps only overshadowed by what he said. ""When I say, I am God, then I feel [faith] well up within my soul. And I see it well up in you, and I see the sick healed, and the blind see, and the dead raised. ... You wanna know how I feel, I never feel so good as when I say I am God,"" he shouted in a full-throated roar in a 1972 sermon. Jones further enraptured crowds with faith healings -- laying hands on disabled or sick people who would miraculously be cured of any ailments. Though insiders later revealed that these healings were staged, Jones' mastery of word and presentation left few in attendance with any doubts about his abilities. He also indoctrinated many young, idealistic liberal white people in progressive 1970s California with the themes of socialism, equality and political activism. And he justified his brand of socialism with the Bible for those recruited from more conservative religious factions, who might have found such left-wing ideas tough to swallow. ""The only ethic by which we can lift mankind today is some form of socialism,"" he said in another 1972 sermon. ""There's a smattering of it in the, in the New Testament. It's very evidently clear on the day of Pentecost that they that believed were together and had all things common."" Socialism, he said, is ""older than the Bible by far."" But by the time Jones and many of his followers completed a lengthy relocation from California to Jonestown in Guyana in 1977, he had begun to change as a speaker. His trademark passionate delivery gave way to blind fury and incredible rage.  Listen to the rage of Jim Jones » . ""I been tired for 25 years,"" the 47-year-old Jones preached in 1978, his voice rising steadily in pitched anger. ""I'm tired of looking at people's faces that don't give a f--- for 25 years, I watch and they don't give a g------. You can lay it out in front of them, and they will not listen. They will not read. They will not do anything, and that's why I have to suffer every day and all night and all through the hours, because I will have nobody but a few that will carry the burden with me. Because you hide yourself away in ignorance."" His rages created a fear that cemented the hold he had on his followers. He also used a ""divide and conquer"" method among his followers. ""What Jones did was try to break all ties that were not to him,"" said former believer Vernon Gosney. ""Transfer all that loyalty, all that bonding to him. And so families were broken apart. Relationships were divided."" Such divisions caused family members to spy and report on one another, or friends to turn in friends for various transgressions. Jones furthered the poisonous atmosphere among his followers by encouraging physical fighting to either solve problems or administer punishment. Audiotapes of such sessions reveal Jones laughing, apparently entertained. Jones' mastery of the spoken word also enabled his many sexual exploits with both female and male followers. Jones deftly justified his actions to his followers by saying that what he did to them was actually for their own benefit, or the benefit of making the church a stronger, tighter-knit organization. He preached that many of his male followers were in denial about their homosexuality, conditioning those followers to accept him if he approached with a sexual advance. And he defused any accusations of sexual perversion on his part by claiming that he gained no personal pleasure from his acts, which he called a ""great sacrifice."" ""And if the leader is attracted to you, then somehow that cultivates,"" Jones said during a temple meeting in 1978. ""Well, you ought to know I'm attracted to you, I'm ready to die for every one of you, so that means I'm attracted to you. You follow what I'm saying? I'm attracted to all of you. How much more attraction can you have than to be ready to have your eyes plucked out?"" By the end at Jonestown, Jones was more rock star than preacher. His sermons and remarks at meetings were littered with obscenities. He regularly had sex with his followers and he abused drugs. By the last month of Jonestown's existence, Jones was so intoxicated at times that he had great difficulty even reading the news aloud to his followers. As the end drew near, Jones' tone as a speaker took darker turns. He constantly fed his followers in Guyana a steady diet of fatalism. ""I said, life is a f------ disease,"" he said. ""It's worse than cancer. It's a disease. And there's only one cure for the sonofabitchin' disease. That's death. And socialists can only take one form of death. What is it? Fight a goddamn war, or revolutionary suicide. If you don't believe life's a disease, then you're dumb. Very dumb."" Spurred on by their leader's talk, Peoples Temple members were ready to follow Jones even into death. At his request, they even wrote personal notes to him expressing their willingness to die for their cause.  Some followers willing to die » . This was the ultimate test of loyalty, and the absolute testimony to the power of his words. As history shows, Jim Jones the orator was chillingly effective.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A political party widely regarded as the liberal option in Libya's historic parliamentary elections was leading in early results from weekend polling, according to election officials. The National Forces Alliance had about 52% of the vote across four of the 13 districts where results were released late Monday. The NFA led in three of those -- Janzour, Tarhuna and Zlitan. But it trailed the field in Misrata, where the Union for the Homeland -- led by prominent Misrata figure Abdurrahman Sewehli -- led the pack. According to the Project on Middle East Democracy, the alliance is a coalition of 58 political parties that has campaigned as a ""more liberal, progressive option"" in the election, the first in Libya in more than four decades. The party's platform focuses heavily on economic issues, according to the Project on Middle East Democracy. The party is led by Mahmoud Jibril, who was prime minister in the interim government that declared Libya a free nation after the 2011 revolt that toppled longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi in October. The mercurial Gadhafi dismantled many of the civic institutions common to democratic states during his 42 years in power, leaving Libya struggling to emerge from his shadow. About 3,500 candidates were running for 200 seats in a new parliament, and turnout was about 60% of the country's 2.8 million registered voters, election commission Chairman Nuri Khalifa Al-Abbar said. The results out Monday were less than 10% of the estimated 1.7 million votes cast in the North African country. Final results are not likely to be announced before the end of the week at the earliest, the state-run LANA news agency reported. And it will take weeks or even months for the winners to form an effective coalition government, said Fadel Lamen, president of the American-Libyan Council. ""The election is providing one thing only: legitimacy,"" said Lamen, who just returned from a visit to Libya. ""Everything else, all the problems, all the challenges, will still be there the morning after."" Observers say a new Libyan state is slowly starting to take shape, but it still could be years -- generations even -- before the revolution will bear fruit. Dartmouth University professor Dirk Vandewalle said signs that Libya is beginning to turn the corner abound. ""Schools and businesses are reopening. Ministries are being reorganized and are starting to make and implement policy,"" said Vandewalle, author of ""A History of Modern Libya."" ""Most importantly, the power of the militias is very slowly but inexorably being eroded,"" he said. The nation's judiciary is even starting to flex its muscle, Vandewalle said, noting that it recently overturned a law that seemed aimed at restricting free expression. The parliamentary vote is a litmus test for Libya in the post-Gadhafi era. Balloting took place 17 months after political demonstrations against Gadhafi broke out in two Libyan cities. Those demonstrations spread, leading to a civil war, NATO airstrikes and Gadhafi's death by a bullet to the head in October. While Gadhafi's death ended much of the violence, unrest continues in parts of the country, particularly the south and the west, and the government has not been able to completely contain the militias that helped overthrow the former leader. But the government has proved capable of responding to such crises, Vandewalle said: Authorities were able to disarm the militia that took over Tripoli's airport on June 4, forced attackers out of the prime minister's office and removed protesters who had blocked access to a state-owned oil company. Whether the government will be able to forge a long-term solution to the country's regionally based militias is another matter, said Lamen, the American-Libyan Council president. ""Having a central solution to a local problem most of the time doesn't work,"" he said. Libyan leaders will instead have to work with local councils, who have the power to rein in the militias. At the same time, those leaders are likely to face difficulties from mid-level bureaucrats in their own government agencies, many of whom are holdovers from Gadhafi's rule. Work stoppages have not been uncommon, Lamen said. Many Libyans seem ready to put the revolution behind them, Vandewalle said, noting an encounter he had with a man whitewashing graffiti on the walls of Tripoli's old city. ""Enough,"" Vandewalle quoted the man as saying when asked why he was going to the trouble. ""Libya is moving on."" The last time Libya held an election was almost half a century ago and, for many people, the act of casting a ballot was novel after 42 years of Gadhafi's rule. Ruling has proved similarly unfamiliar, Vandewalle said. ""It would be utterly impossible to construct in only a few months all the institutions of a modern, properly functioning state Gadhafi destroyed in his pursuit of statelessness for 42 years,"" he said. ""Building a state and a nation takes time, ideas, compromise and leadership -- particularly difficult if, as in Libya, the social and political landscape after the civil war was essentially a tabula rasa, and none of those qualities now needed to construct a modern state were in demand during the Gadhafi period,"" Vandewalle said. Once seated, the new national assembly will be tasked with appointing a transitional government and crafting a constitution. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the Libyan people on the election and hailed the electoral staff for ""well-conducted and transparent"" polling. ""Last year, thousands of Libyans sacrificed their lives or suffered lasting injury in order to win the right of the Libyan people to build a new state founded on human dignity and the rule of law,"" Ban said in a statement Sunday. ""Yesterday, their determination was again on display as men and women, young and old, cast their ballots, many with deep emotion, even in some areas where they faced threats to their security."" This story is based on reporting by CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Tripoli and Michael Pearson and Moni Basu in Atlanta.","NEW: Liberal party leading in early results .

"Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo (CNN) -- The United Nations and Congolese army are sending additional soldiers to the troubled regional capital of Goma, a U.N. spokesman said Wednesday.

Rutshuru, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Goma, was taken by M23 rebels on July 1, but they retreated within days and the Congolese regular army moved back into the town Wednesday. The Congolese army is dispatching a U.S. trained elite battalion to Goma, where most shops were closed Wednesday because of threats from M23 to take Goma. The M23, linked to Laurent Nkunda's CNDP rebel group, still controls the town of Bunagana. Goma is in on the border with Rwanda on Lake Kivu.","U.N. spokesman: Extra troops reinforcing regional capital on border with Rwanda .

"(CNN) -- The Russian Football Union has drawn up an ambitious wish list of some of the sport's biggest names to replace departed coach Dick Advocaat. Top of the bill is undoubtedly ex-Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola, who quit the former European and Spanish champions at the end of last season in order to take a break from the game. Former England coach Fabio Capello is also on the 13-man list, posted on the RFU website on Tuesday, along with his fellow Italian Marcello Lippi -- a World Cup winner in 2006, and now with Chinese team Guangzhou Evergrande. Former Argentina and Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa is also being considered, despite insisting that he wants to stay at Athletic Bilbao in the wake of an argument with the Spanish club's board. The RFU is also targeting two men with less international-level experience but a good club pedigree: Rafael Benitez and Harry Redknapp. Former Liverpool and Valencia boss Benitez has not held a coaching position since being sacked by Inter Milan in December 2010, while Redknapp is a more recent addition to the unemployed ranks after being sacked by English club Tottenham in June. Redknapp had been widely favored to replace Capello as England coach, but the 65-year-old missed out as Roy Hodgson was instead appointed ahead of Euro 2012. Valery Nepomnyashchy, who took Cameroon to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup, is one of seven Russians on the list. Former U.S.S.R. international Valery Gazzaev coached the national side from 2002-03, while Anatoliy Byshovets was in charge in 1998 and led the Soviet team to Olympic gold a decade before that. Dynamo Kiev's Yury Syomin had a brief spell as Russia boss in 2005. Of the others, former Dynamo Moscow manager Andrei Kobelev and Yuri Krasnozhan (ex-Anzhi Makhachkala) have had no top-level international experience, while Nikolai Pisarev coaches the Russia Under-21 team. Russia's last two coaches have been Dutchmen, with Advocaat following Guus Hiddink. Hiddink took Russia to the semifinals of Euro 2008, but then failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup as the team surprisingly lost to unfancied Slovenia in a playoff. He is now coach at Anzhi. Advocaat helped Zenit St. Petersburg become only the second Russian club to win a European title in the second-tier UEFA Cup in 2008, and was named Russia coach after a short spell in charge of both Belgium's national side and Dutch team AZ Alkmaar. He announced before Euro 2012 that he would stand down after the tournament to return to his homeland with PSV Eindhoven, and Russia crashed out in the group stage after failing to follow up the impressive opening 4-1 win over the Czech Republic.","Former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola is wanted by Russia .

"Miami (CNN) -- Amid a report she has defected, the daughter of Cuba's vice president has been living with relatives in Tampa, Florida, for nearly two weeks, an individual close to her told CNN on Tuesday. Glenda Murillo, daughter of Vice President Marino Murillo, was on her way Tuesday to visit her boyfriend in Hialeah, Florida, and could not be reached for comment, the individual close to her said by telephone. Asked by CNN to confirm a published report that Murillo had defected, the individual responded, ""You already know that."" Murillo defected this month, reported El Nuevo Herald in Miami, citing sources. According to the newspaper, Glenda Murillo crossed the Mexico border at Laredo, Texas, and was paroled as provided for by a policy that allows Cubans who set foot on U.S. land to stay. The younger Murillo never received a U.S. visa to visit relatives or study in the United States, according to El Nuevo Herald. Marino Murillo, 51, is vice president of the Council of Ministers and a member of the Cuban State Council. In 2011, he was put in charge of implementing economic reforms. Murillo told reporters in March that his country's political system is ""sustainable"" and that it will not change. Asked late Tuesday to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, ""U.S. laws on confidentiality do not permit me to disclose the specifics about individual visa and parole cases, or requests for asylum.""

"Kitamoto, Japan (CNN) -- Incense burns in the corner of the Nakai family living room -- part of an altar to their daughter Yumi, who committed suicide seven years ago. Yumi was just 12 years old when she took her own life, jumping from a condominium building. ""We never saw this coming,"" says her father, Shinji. ""She was a daddy's girl, we went swimming and skiing together and loved to take trips. I was convinced there had been a mistake."" Her mother, Setsuko, lights another candle at her daughter's altar and says a prayer for her, as she does every day. She is convinced bullying at school was one of the main reasons Yumi killed herself. In the months preceding her suicide, Yumi told her mother she was being taunted by some of her classmates. ""I called the school and spoke to her teacher,"" she says. ""The teacher said, 'I'll deal with this problem' and never got back to me, so we assumed it was solved."" Yumi hinted at bullying in the note she left behind, writing that her decision to take her life ""may be because of some of my classmates, studies and exams."" But the parents are still fighting a legal battle with the school and the Kitamoto Board of Education. The family alleges the school was negligent in bully prevention and investigating her suicide. Shinji Nakai claims the school only showed him a fraction of the investigation they carried out -- a claim the board of education rejects. In a statement to CNN, the Kitamoto Board of Education said it was ""co-operatively investigating the cause of her suicide, hearing from her parents, collecting as much information as possible including the possibility of bullying."" The school also spoke to students, but school officials found no information that connected to her suicide, they said. A recent court case ruled in the school's favor. Yumi's parents filed an appeal to a higher court on Monday. South Korea teenagers bullied to death . This ongoing legal drama comes as a recent bullying case has horrified Japan. A boy in Otsu, west of Tokyo, committed suicide last year by jumping off a building after bullies allegedly forced him to practice killing himself. Japanese media and the parents claim the boy had sought help from a teacher, but his pleas were ignored. The case has prompted the government to set up a special team to help schools and board of education curb bullying. The new anti-bullying task force will be responsible for identifying cases of serious bullying at an early stage and giving advice to education boards and schools, said Hirofumi Hirano, Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, at a press conference Tuesday. The education ministry also announced plans to conduct an emergency survey of all elementary, junior high and high schools in Japan next month in an attempt to draw up appropriate prevention measures. ""People have pointed to how there's too much academic pressure on adolescents in Japan which creates stress and leads to bullying in schools; other people talk about how Japanese cases of bullying can be group orientated,"" says Sachiko Horiguchi, an anthropologist at Tokyo's Temple University. Horiguchi, however, believes the problem is far more complex and bullying is certainly not an issue peculiar to Japan. But one issue recurring in Japan is ""the problem of the school and the Board of Education failing to accept the fact there's some bullying,"" Horiguchi says. ""That can be quite common in many schools, but it's increasingly become more difficult probably to deny that."" Yumi's parents agree. They believe there has been a cover up at her school and no one wants to accept there is a problem. ""I think the problem is the evaluation-first system in Japanese education. If the school admits a bullying incident, it would affect the teacher's career,"" says her father, Shinji. ""The members of the board of education and the school are like family members, they tend to protect each other. It's disadvantageous for them to make the investigation open, so the truth is hidden."" Yumi's parents want acknowledgment of their daughter's bullying to finally feel enough closure to be able to bury her ashes in the graveyard. ""I just want to know the truth, why did she have to die?"" Shinji says. ""Unless I know, I just can't accept her death.""

"BURSA, Turkey (CNN) -- Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian Wednesday became the first Armenian head of state to travel to Turkey to attend a soccer game between the two countries' national teams. Armenian President Serzh Sarkasian (right) pictured with Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul during Gul's visit to Yerevan in 2008. Sarkisian and Turkish president Abdullah Gul arrived at the stadium in Bursa together in a car flying the national flags of both countries. In an exclusive interview with CNN before the game, Gul said the event opened a new chapter for relations between Armenia and Turkey. But when asked, he avoided saying whether the border between the two neighbors would be opened before 2010. At the match, Turkish supporters vastly outnumbered Armenian fans and gave the Armenian national anthem the standard treatment for most visiting foreign teams -- they booed. Small pockets of Armenian supporters waved the tri-color flag of Armenia. Turkey won the World Cup qualifying group game 2-0 but with both countries already unable to progress to the 2010 tournament in South Africa, the significance of the game was in its symbolism. This round of ""football diplomacy,"" comes just days after the two governments signed a historic series of protocols to establish diplomatic relations between the two neighbors. ""This is going to be the biggest change in the South Caucasus since 1994,"" said Gevorg Tel-Gabrielyan, the Armenia country director for the Eurasia Partnership Foundation. He was in Bursa on Wednesday, hosting a conference of Armenian and Turkish academics examining bilateral relations. ""If this happens,"" he added, ""its going to change geopolitics in the region."" Armenia and Turkey have been separated by nearly a century of animosity and distrust. The protocols call for establishment of embassies in each others' capitals, and for re-opening the Turkish-Armenian border, which has been closed since 1993. The soccer game was also being held in Bursa, which centuries ago was the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Thousands of police were deployed to maintain strict security. On Tuesday, Turkey's prime minister made a public appeal to Turkish football fans, to greet Sarkisian with hospitality and to avoid provocations. Despite strong support from the United States, the European Union and Russia, there is considerable opposition among nationalists in Turkey and Armenia to the peace process. Sarkisian has been met by angry protests both within Armenia and among the influential diaspora communities in the United States, France and Lebanon. Thousands of protesters in the Armenian capital marched to the country's genocide memorial chanting ""no concessions to the Turks,"" last week. Armenia has long demanded that Turkey recognize the World War I-era massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turkish soldiers as genocide. Modern-day Turkey vehemently denies a genocide took place and is calling for an international commission of historical experts to examine these tragic events. Meanwhile, opposition party leaders in Turkey have criticized the agreement, as has Turkey's close ally in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan fought and lost a war against Armenia in the early 1990s. On Sunday, Turkey's prime minister made a fresh call for Armenia to withdraw its troops from the disputed Azerbaijani territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. For the new agreement to go into effect, the documents must first be put to a vote in the Turkish and Armenian parliaments. There is no guarantee lawmakers will ratify the agreement. The process of unraveling the complicated network of regional, domestic and historical grievances dividing Armenia and Turkey was jump-started in September of 2008, when Gul traveled to Yerevan to attend a football match between the two national teams. The diplomatic rapprochement has also gotten valuable support from powerful patrons, experts say. ""This is one of the few places in the world where Russia and the United States are pulling in the same direction,"" says Hugh Pope, an expert on Turkey with the International Crisis Group. ""Both want to see a more stable Caucasus."" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were both present at the signing ceremony for the Turkish-Armenian agreement in Switzerland on Saturday. Wednesday's game in Bursa was the final match for the coach of the Turkish national team, Fatih Terim, who announced his resignation after Turkey's most recent football defeat. Despite that, the headline in one of Turkey's biggest newspapers billed today's football game ""Our most challenging match.""","Armenian president's visit comes amid thaw in relations between neighbors .

"New York (CNN) -- Ernest Bai Koroma is the fourth president of Sierra Leone, a nation still very much living in the shadow of a brutal decade-long civil war that only ended in 2002. He came to power in a wave of exuberance, promising to transform a country still scarred by civil war. Since then, the former CEO has gone hard on the message that his country is open for business to foreign investors. A World Bank report in 2008 deemed Sierra Leone the easiest place to start a business in West Africa, a message that Koroma has been pushing across the world. Koroma believes that while progress has been slow, his country is finally realizing its potential, particularly as a destination for foreign business investment in Africa. Sierra Leone has some high profile advocates; former UK prime minister Tony Blair and George Soros are among those who back Koroma's plans for foreign business investment in the country. One of the country's ambitious initiatives is establishing a private, special economic zone outside of the capital Freetown, where some 20 hectares of land are being cleared to welcome foreign businesses. President Koroma sat down with CNN's Stephanie Elam during his recent visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. CNN: Sierra Leone has been battling poverty for so long. Are new jobs being created so that people in Sierra Leone can start working to help build their wealth, build their earnings so that they can live comfortably? EK: Unemployment is still a problem, especially among our youthful population. We have some that are not educated, some that are not skilled. We are trying to ensure that we develop appropriate technical vocational institutions that will address the youth, will prepare them for the job market. The issue is not only to create jobs for them but to make them competitive and to make them earn wages that will guarantee them a future. CNN: For a lot of people, when they hear Sierra Leone they wonder about the diamonds. They wonder about whether or not the idea of a 'blood diamond' is something of the past. What do you say to that? EK: Yeah the issue of the blood diamond is an issue of the past. And this was when the war was raging, and before the war. But now we have put in place new mining act controls to regulate the mining sector. And we now have companies that are engaging the expectation of diamonds that are working and a government diamond office that regulates the processing of diamonds. And it is creating employment for the people and it is increasing revenue generation for the country. CNN: What would you say has been the progress so far on getting corruption out of the government? EK: We have made substantial progress -- we have now put in place the 2008 Anti-Corruption Act which has given anti-corruption [officials] the independence that is required, by giving them the authority to prosecute anybody that they believe is found wanting -- and I have also in the broadcast to the nation, and on many occasions, made it clear that nobody is protected, not even a member of my family. CNN: Do we see people feeling safer in Sierra Leone? Do you yourself feel safe when you're out? EK: I believe I am one of the presidents that drives around without any security. I drive around in the streets and people know that I am moving around and they yell, they wave. You can drive at any time, at any location in the country without any hit-and-runs. That is how safe the country is. CNN: Let's talk a little about women in Sierra Leone and in your government. I know that you have a female foreign minister. How important is this idea of having gender equality in the government? EK: We are working on improving the gender participation in government and other sectors. I must say that it has not improved as much as we want but we are making progress. There are ambassadors that are women, we have heads of companies in the country that are women, chairpersons. It is growing and becoming very interesting. CNN: What do you hope your legacy will be for Sierra Leone? EK: A Sierra Leone that has changed from a post-conflict humanitarian rehabilitated country to a country that has taken off on the path of real growth, and I want to be remembered as the person that led the business for the new economic growth of Sierra Leone.

"(CNN) -- Unlike NBC, other TV networks aren't hoping to attract more than 200 million viewers as the London Olympics unfolds throughout the next 16 days. That said, they're certainly not going to make the ratings game any easier on the National Broadcasting Company, which reportedly shelled out $1.18 billion for the U.S. rights to air the games. (That's about $286 million more than they paid in 2008.) ""One of TV's first great reality shows,"" the Olympics used to be one of the few original programs to air during the summer, said Ron Simon, a curator at the Paley Center for Media. Back then, there was hardly any effort to counter program. Now, with competition shows such as CBS's ""Big Brother,"" ABC's ""Bachelor Pad"" and Fox's ""So You Think You Can Dance"" -- not to mention scripted cable dramas such as ""Burn Notice"" and ""The Closer"" that often pull in up to 6 million viewers -- other networks could likely draw a substantial audience during the Olympics. It can be challenging for any series to go up against the Olympics, Simon said, but ""there is the possibility that if there's not compelling storylines for the Olympics, there are some real interesting shows out there (for people to watch)."" One thing is for sure: Cable TV isn't holding back. Beloved dramas such as AMC's ""Breaking Bad,"" TNT's ""The Closer"" and DirecTV's ""Damages,"" which have all embarked on their final seasons, are surely hoping for steady ratings throughout the games. ""Cable is going about business as usual,"" said Robert J. Thompson, the founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""There are a lot of table scraps to be gotten."" The No. 1 reason broadcast networks ""don't want to completely roll over and play dead during the Olympics,"" Thompson said, is because they have schedules they want to promote for fall. This is a really important time for networks to be promoting new shows, he said, which is why NBC plans to premiere pilot episodes for ""Go On"" and ""Animal Practice"" directly after Olympic coverage on August 8 and 12, respectively. ""The real value of the Olympics is to use it as a venue to promote the upcoming season,"" Thompson said. In total, 211 million viewers in the U.S. tuned in to the 2008 Beijing Olympics (with about 27 million people tuning in each day), making it the most-viewed TV event to date, according to Nielsen Media Research. But that's not always the case. Between viewers' fascination with Beijing, the ""magical"" opening ceremony and compelling personal storylines, the 2008 games had a lot going for it, Simon said. ""It goes back to the old network formula,"" Simon added. ""You need the compelling personality and the storylines. And that sort of has to develop. Obviously four years ago, there were great numbers because of one person, Michael Phelps, and the series of events and expectations around him."" It's too early to tell if subsequent plots -- such as Phelps becoming the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time or Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's record 100- and 200-meter dash times -- will develop at the London Games. Though there's already a good deal of buzz surrounding athletes such as 17-year-old swimmer Missy Franklin and 16-year-old gymnast Gabby Douglas. ""Both Bolt and Phelps are back, but they're sort of not what they once were,"" Simon said. ""You're going to have to look for other people that not only are fantastic within their individual sports, but that can create that storyline."" Even NBC seems unsure of what to expect, given the network's conflicting statements regarding its expectations. ""I know this is going to stun you, but I think these Olympics will be huge,"" Alan Wurtzel, NBC's president of research, said in a conference call with reporters via The Salt Lake Tribune. ""Without question, they're going to dominate 17 nights of prime time. I believe they will rank in the Top Five of the most-watched events in television history, with north of 200 million viewers."" Meanwhile, NBC Sports Group Chairman Mark Lazarus said at a June news conference, via Forbes: ""I would love to match those scenarios, though it's unlikely. We are not measuring ourselves against Beijing."" Despite garnering respectable ratings during the U.S. trials, it's difficult to predict how many people will tune in once the Olympics are underway. And while NBC will likely take home a gold medal in the ratings game, other networks shouldn't be counted out of the games.","With new original programs, other networks will likely draw a substantial audience .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Li Na continued the defense of her French Open crown on Thursday with a second round win over Stephanie Foretz Gacon. Seventh seed Li, who became China's first grand slam champion with her Roland Garros triumph last year, recorded a straight-forward 6-0 6-2 victory over the Frenchwoman in just 52 minutes. The 30-year-old will play unseeded American Christina McHale in round three, after the world No. 35 got the better of compatriot Lauren Davis. Li's fellow grand slam winner Petra Kvitova also registered a comfortable win, beating 90th-ranked Pole Urszula Radwanska 6-1 6-3. The 2011 Wimbledon champion, ranked No. 4 in the world, set up a meeting with Russian Nina Bratchikova. Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki also looked in good touch as she scored a 6-1 6-4 victory against Australia's Jarmila Gajdosova. The Dane, who is yet to win a grand slam title, has not clinched a WTA Tour title since August 2011 and has recently struggled with form and fitness. But having switched from being coached by her father Piotr to working with former Australian Open Champion Thomas Johansson, Wozniacki feels positive about her future. ""It's been working well,"" the 21-year-old, who will face 23rd seed Kaia Kanepi in round three, told the tournament's official website. ""He tells me what he thinks and he's not soft.

"(CNN) -- Second seed Maria Sharapova continued her quest for a career grand slam with a convincing win at the French Open on Friday, while world No. 3 Agnieszka Radwanska and former champion Ana Ivanovic crashed out of the Paris tournament. Sharapova has tasted success at three of tennis' four grand slams, but she has been no further than the semifinals at Roland Garros -- losing at that stage last year and in 2007. However, the Russian looked in fine form as she brushed aside Japan's world No. 88 Ayumi Morita 6-1 6-1 in exactly one hour to set up a third-round tie with Chinese 25th seed Peng Shuai. The match was originally scheduled to take place on Thursday, but it was delayed by Paul-Henri Mathieu's marathon win against John Isner in the men's tournament. ""I had never faced my opponent before, and when she has time she really goes for her shots, so I wanted to get her on the move,"" the 25-year-old Sharapova said on the WTA Tour's website. ""I played well, aggressive, and moved in when I had to. With every round I'm going to be playing tougher opponents, and that's when you really want to raise your level. That's what I'll try to do in the next round."" Sharapova's compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova produced the day's biggest shock by registering a comfortable 6-1 6-2 third-round win against Radwanska, who eliminated former world No. 1 Venus Williams on Wednesday. ""I haven't played that well in a long time,"" said the 2009 French Open champion. ""I was in control of my things. ""When I feel in control of my moves and am not depending so much on my opponent, it brings me the best feelings. That's why I really enjoy tennis, that's why I love tennis. And I haven't had this feeling for quite some time."" The world No. 28's reward is a last-16 encounter with Italy's Sara Errani, who also upset the odds to progress as she knocked out Ivanovic. The 21st seed came from one set down to beat the Serbian 1-6 7-5 6-3. Ivanovic has not been past the fourth round of the clay-court event since winning the title four years ago. ""I was really pleased the way I started,"" said Ivanovic, who followed fellow former world No. 1s Serena and Venus Williams in exiting the tournament. ""I was really aggressive and created a lot of opportunities for myself. ""Then in the second and third sets she started raising her level a lot and putting a lot more on the ball. I also started getting a bit flatfooted and hitting more unforced errors as the match went on.""

The 2011 U.S. Open winner set up a match with American youngster Sloane Stephens.

"London (CNN) -- Thousands of athletes and many more spectators have gathered in London Wednesday for the opening of the 2012 Paralympic Games, set to be the biggest ever held. Over the course of the 11-day event, some 4,280 athletes from 165 countries -- more than ever before -- will compete in 21 sports, with more than 500 gold medals up for grabs. The opening ceremony, titled ""Enlightenment,"" features a cast of more than 3,000 adult volunteers, 100 children and more than 100 professional performers, as well as the traditional athletes' parade. Five-time U.S. Paralympian Scott Danberg has been selected as flag bearer to lead the 227-member U.S. Paralympic Team into the Olympic Stadium, in east London. The Paralympic flame will be carried into the stadium to light the cauldron at the climax of the show. The torch set off on a 24-hour relay Tuesday evening from Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire, the birthplace of the Paralympic movement, and reached London Wednesday morning. Thousands of people lined the streets to see the Paralympic torch relay wend its way through the capital on its way to the Olympic Park. The torchbearers included Paralympians, people who have overcome disability to achieve their goals and local heroes nominated by their communities. The relay route passed many iconic London sites, including Westminster Abbey, London Zoo, Tower Bridge and Abbey Road, where the torchbearers recreated the iconic Beatles album cover shot. The Agitos, the symbol of the Paralympic Games, has replaced the five rings that were suspended from Tower Bridge during the Olympic Games. And excitement levels are again rising in Britain and worldwide, with more than 2.3 million Paralympic tickets sold and huge numbers around the globe expected to watch the events on television and online. ""The Paralympic Games have come home to Britain -- and it will be the biggest Games yet, with more athletes, more countries and more spectators than ever before,"" said Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ""The talent, commitment and inspiration of the Torchbearers, and ParalympicsGB, reminds us all what can be achieved when we focus on what people can do, rather than what they can't.""

"(CNN) -- While Li Na was battling to keep her French Open title defense alive on Saturday, the scene of last year's triumph was being recreated in her native China. Such has been the impact of Asia's first grand slam singles champion in her homeland that tennis chiefs are seeking to bring a bit of Roland Garros to Beijing. A clay court and two giant screens have been set up in one of the city's major shopping malls for an interactive experience that will last until the tournament ends on June 10. ""I'm very pleased that a country like China follows our prestigious tournament,"" French Tennis Federation president Jean Gachassin said in a statement. ""For us, it's an extraordinary opportunity to promote clay-court tennis. I'd like to heartily thank the Chinese Tennis Federation for welcoming us on their home soil for this fabulous event."" Courting a country with a population of 1.3 billion makes sense for any sport serious about global growth, and the exhibition has been backed by major sponsors such as Longines, Lacoste and Peugeot. Li has become a marketer's dream in the past 12 months, securing lucrative endorsement deals which have made her the second highest-paid athlete in the world behind fellow tennis star Maria Sharapova. Her hopes of being around for next weekend's women's final remained alive after she came from behind to beat young American Christina McHale on Saturday. The 30-year-old rebounded from a first-set debacle in which she made 24 unforced errors to triumph 3-6 6-2 6-1 and earn a last-16 clash with Kazakh qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova. The world No. 7 had a surprisingly tough match against an opponent 10 years her junior and 29 places lower in the rankings, one who lost in the first round in Paris last year and in 2010. ""Tennis is best of three sets, so even if I lose the first set, I still have a chance,"" said Li, who is the only Chinese player left in the tournament after Peng Shuai lost to Sharapova on Saturday. ""In the first set I was just following what she was doing. I felt like she was the champion on the court. But I changed a little bit at the beginning of the second set to play my way, and I'm happy I was able to do that today."" Li beat Francesca Schiavone in last year's final, but the 2010 French Open champion will not feature in the second week of this tournament after suffering a 3-6 6-3 8-6 defeat by Uzbekistan-born American Varvara Lepchenko. The 63rd-ranked Lepchenko's reward for beating the Italian is a daunting clash with fourth-seeded Czech Petra Kvitova, who battled to a 6-2 4-6 6-1 win against Russia's world No. 109 Nina Bratchikova. Second-ranked Sharapova cruised into the fourth round as she crushed 28th seed Peng 6-2 6-1 to set up a clash with Czech Klara Zakopalova, who defeated Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. The 25-year-old Sharapova was a semifinalist here last year and in 2007, but the Russian may finally win the only grand slam title to elude her if she can keep up the form that has seen her drop just five games in three matches so far. However, fellow former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki must continue her agonizing wait for a first major title. The Dane, now ranked ninth, saved four match-points before losing 1-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 against Estonian 23rd seed Kaia Kanepi. Kanepi blew 5-1 leads in the last two sets, but held her nerve to earn a last-16 clash with 21-year-old Dutch player Arantxa Rus. Last year Rus beat former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters before losing in round three, and she has gone one step further after eliminating German 25th seed Julia Gorges 7-6 (7-5) 2-6 6-2 in a match that ended as darkness fell.","Defending champion Li Na reaches the fourth round of the French Open .

"(CNN) -- Bolton's Fabrice Muamba made an emotional appearance at their Reebok Stadium before their game against Tottenham Wednesday, just 46 days after collapsing on the pitch against the same opposition. He walked on to the field to a standing ovation with the crowd chanting his name in unison. The 24-year-old midfielder was visibly moved as he acknowledged their cheers before joining his fiancee Shauna Magunda in the stands to watch the vital English Premier League game. Muamba's heart stopped for 78 minutes after his collapse at White Hart Lane on March 17 in an FA Cup tie. Millions watched the horrific scenes on television but he has since made a remarkable recovery and left the London Chest Hospital on April 16. ""This is a special place, the support has been overwhelming and I am just grateful for that,"" Muamba told Sky Sports before Wednesday's match. ""I am okay, I am getting stronger every day. I am happy to be back I am just happy to be able to speak to people again and walk freely."" In his absence, Bolton have continued to battle against relegation, but their hopes of avoiding the drop suffered a major setback as Tottenham won 4-1 with goals from Luka Modric, Rafael van der Vaart and a second half double from Emmanuel Adebayor. The visitors dominated and might have been ahead before Croatian star Modric scored just before halftime with a superb long range effort. Bolton equalized soon after the break as Nigel Reo Coker converted with a 51st minute strike, but Tottenham's lead was restored when Dutch international van der Vaart finished off a flowing move. Adebayor ended any hopes of a home comeback with two neat finishes after being played through by more slick passing. Victory left Tottenham in fourth spot in the battle for Champions League places, edging Newcastle on goal difference. Newcastle were 2-0 winners at Chelsea Wednesday, all but ending the home side's hopes of qualification for the Champions League through league position. Chelsea face Liverpool in the FA Cup final at Wembley Saturday and Bayern Munich in the final of the Champions League on May 19 in a bid for double silverware under interim manager Roberto di Matteo. Despite these upcoming big matches, they fielded a strong side at home to Newcastle, but were second best once Papiss Demba Cisse had put the visitors ahead with a stunning first half strike. Chelsea showed little sign of equalizing and Senegal star Cisse finished them off in injury time with another sublime effort.","Fabrice Muamba appears on pitch before Bolton's match against Tottenham .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A huge manhunt involving soldiers and police is underway in China for an elusive armed robber who is thought to be behind a string of murders dating back to 2004. The search for 42-year-old Zhou Kehua -- one of the country's most wanted criminals -- is focused on the southwestern city of Chongqing, China's biggest metropolis, after a woman was shot dead and two others injured on Friday morning outside a bank during an attempted robbery, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Later that day, local police reported that a railway policeman was killed while in pursuit of a man believed to be Zhou -- his tenth victim in eight years following a series of robberies in Chongqing, Nanjing and Changsha. All his victims were shot in the head, according to media reports, while police say he targeted people withdrawing money from banks. Chongqing authorities recalled officers on vacation as they launched a full-scale search for the fugitive in mountainous areas around the city, Xinhua said. Police and military units from Hunan and Jiangsu provinces were also mobilized. The search uncovered a cave that Zhou is believed to have stayed in, China Daily reported. Inside were two cigarette cases, a T-shirt and human waste, the report added. Police have said Zhou is an expert at survival in the wild, though there is no record of him serving in the military. According to China Daily, the Ministry of Public Security has classified Zhou as a ""class-A"" suspect, with a total 5.4 million yuan (US$849,000) in rewards being offered for information leading to his capture. A huge -- but ultimately fruitless -- search for Zhou was carried out in January this year after he allegedly shot and robbed a man who had just withdrawn 200,000 yuan ($31,700) from a bank in Nanjing before fleeing in a car. Nanjing Public Security Bureau's Xuanwu district office told CNN at the time that more than 80,000 police officers took part in the manhunt. It also published two video clips online of the suspect escaping the scene. Authorities have warned people against attempting to confront Zhou as he is considered ""ruthless and highly dangerous,"" Xinhua said. China increases bounty for deadly robber .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN)  -- The death toll from flooding that has covered large parts of Brazil continued to rise Friday, with the government reporting seven new fatalities, bringing the total to 38. Floodwaters reach almost to the tops of some homes in Piaui state in Brazil. The rain-induced floods left nearly 800,000 people displaced, according to the Brazilian civil defense agency. Rain has fallen steadily in some parts of the country for more than two weeks and is forecast to continue for another 10 days. World Vision, a relief agency working in Brazil, predicted it could take 30 days for flood waters to recede. Communities in 10 states have been swamped by the floods, though most of the fatalities have occurred in the country's northeast, officials said. The Brazilian government was working with local governments Friday to deliver food, cleaning materials and other supplies to the affected areas -- using helicopters to reach some areas made impassable by flooded roads. Meteorologists and other weather specialists are divided over the cause of the downpours, particularly in the normally dry northeastern section of the nation. Some say ocean temperatures are to blame, while others say deforestation has led to the climate change. Brazil has been devastated by rain-swollen rivers for months. Flooding in the southern part of the nation in November and December killed more than 120 people and left about another 30 missing.

"(CNN) -- Today is Black Friday -- the longstanding cornerstone of the holiday season -- and many retailers are seeing the need to unveil even more incredible offers than ever to battle the growing suggestion of Black Friday fatigue. Accenture's holiday shopping study this year showed a rise in consumer apathy toward the Black Friday shopping tradition, with more than half of consumers (53 percent) saying they were unlikely to or undecided on whether they will shop on Black Friday (compared to 48 percent in 2009). Traditionally, Black Friday, with its notorious ""door-buster"" deals, was the kick-off to the holiday shopping season, both for the store and the consumer. Now, it could be argued that Halloween marks the new holiday shopping starting point, as retailers try to catch as many sales as they can as early as possible with holiday advertising, promotions and an online push. This year will pose its own challenges in the fight for discretionary dollars as retailers also have to compensate for Christmas falling on a Saturday this year, meaning customers have one fewer weekend of holiday shopping. You can trace the increasingly lackluster consumer response to the Black Friday shopping tradition to the turbulent 2008 holidays. That year, we saw some retailers offer eye-popping discounts as high as 75 percent across their stores in early November to compensate for high inventories, high uncertainty, lower consumer confidence and less money in their pockets. This was a defining moment that dramatically changed the game. It not only took some of the gloss off Black Friday that year, but it also changed expectations for years to come of knowing when you would be able to snag the best holiday promotions and sales throughout the season. The growth in popularity of online shopping and the growing opportunity to find as many good deals online as in the store poses another challenge to Black Friday's popularity. The increase in the number of homes with broadband internet access means that more and more shoppers can afford to, and prefer to, stay home and bag the offers online, rather than brave the crowds. Accenture's survey showed that 69 percent of consumers said that they will be buying holiday gifts online this year, up from 64 percent in 2009. Despite this changing landscape, Black Friday is not finished. It is still a significant day for a huge number of consumers and the sense of tradition that many attach to it means that it still has a role to play. A number of retailers are already exploring creative opportunities to regain some of Black Friday's appeal and are looking at ways to engage with the customer through many different channels. Some are offering deals throughout the week. Some are opening their doors earlier. Some offered door-buster savings on Thanksgiving Day on their websites. So instead of waking up at 4 a.m. -- or earlier -- and braving the elements with the rest of the die-hard shoppers for a couple of hours on Friday, for many consumers, it was a simple question: ""Do I grab my laptop and surf the net for presents or sit in front of the TV to watch the game -- or both?"" The purpose of the brick-and-mortar store, however, is shifting from just being the place to make a transaction to providing more of an experience for the shopper. Retailers have an opportunity to redefine Black Friday and stimulate excitement around the day, helping them to build customer loyalty throughout the season. With all the challenges, Black Friday will remain at the heart of the holiday shopping season for the foreseeable future and the winning retailers will be the ones that continue to go beyond the door-buster deal to win the hearts and minds -- and wallets -- of the consumer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Janet Hoffman.","Black Friday losing significance as a key holiday shopping day, says Janet Hoffman .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Torrential rain in Myanmar has forced thousands to flee their homes and flooded hundreds of thousands of acres of rice paddies, media reports and aid workers say. Two weeks of heavy monsoon rain caused the flooding, which has primarily affected the Irrawaddy Delta region close to the capital Yangon. Around the port city of Pathein, 236,000 people had been affected, with 35,000 moved to temporary relief camps in schools, monasteries and churches, said Denis De Poerck, director of program operations for Save the Children in Myanmar. He said the families that had not fled were living on the upper floors of their homes and long boats were the main form of transport. The government, private benefactors and the World Food Program had provided food rations to flood victims, he added. ""What people need now is non-food items -- clothing, cooking pots and utensils,"" he told CNN by telephone from Yangon. The state-run New Light of Myanmar reported that President Thein Sein on Sunday visited Bago, another flood-hit area east of the capital, to provide assistance to some of the victims. De Poerck added that the United Nations estimated that 200,000 acres of rice paddies had been destroyed and 55,000 acres remained under water. One acre is around the size of an American football field. Myanmar often suffers from flooding during the monsoon season but in the areas assessed by Save the Children locals said the floods were the worst since 1997. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar's southern delta region, killing 130,000 people.

"Northern Syria (CNN) -- Tanks pounded the Syrian city of Aleppo on Saturday, a sign that a much-feared government offensive in the country's largest city has started, as the opposition warned its allies they would bear responsibility for a ""massacre"" if they don't act soon. Government forces shelled Aleppo neighborhoods, and Free Syrian Army rebels squared off with government soldiers in and around the city, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Syrian TV said ""terrorists"" suffered heavy losses after clashes in three neighborhoods. ""Our friends and allies will bear responsibility for the terrifying massacres that will happen in Aleppo if they don't move soon. This regime is planning for a big massacre in Aleppo,"" Abdulbaset Sieda, head of the Syrian National Council, told reporters in Abu Dhabi. He urged allies to act outside of the U.N. Security Council, as resolutions there can be vetoed, and called for more aid and weapons. ""The rebels now are fighting with primitive types of weapons against the killing machine. We need weapons that will allow us to stop tanks and planes. This is what we need,"" said Sieda. At least 160 people were killed across Syria on Saturday, the LCC said. More than 30 of those deaths were reported in Aleppo, Syria's commercial hub and largest city. ""The heaviest clashes since the beginning of the revolution are taking place now in a number of neighborhoods in Aleppo city,"" the LCC said. For more than a week, regime forces and rebel fighters have clashed there, and the regime has fired artillery from warplanes. Fighters have been preparing for a major confrontation, and security forces continued military buildup with reinforcements from Raqqa province and other regions, opposition groups said. Deama, an activist in Aleppo, told CNN that the expected massive military operations have begun since it is the first day the regime is moving into the city with tank fire. CNN isn't using her full name because disclosing it could put her in danger. ""Many people have been killed,"" she said, including a mother and her two children. ""More tanks have arrived at a military school in northern Aleppo and started shelling for the first time from this location today."" She said the regime is shelling displaced people from Homs and Idlib who've taken refuge in Aleppo, and thousands of them have had to evacuate yet again. The uprising started in March 2011 after the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protests. U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria Kofi Annan expressed concern Saturday for the concentration of heavy weapons and troops around Aleppo ""in anticipation of an imminent battle in Syria's largest city."" ""I believe that the escalation of the military build-up in Aleppo and the surrounding area is further evidence of the need for the international community to come together to persuade the parties that only a political transition, leading to a political settlement will resolve this crisis and bring peace to the Syrian people,"" he said in a statement. Also Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia has no plans to offer al-Assad asylum, state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. ""Those who are trying to plant this idea into the minds of the international community, pursue their dirty goal,"" he reportedly said. ""It's just provocations by those who want to put the entire blame for what is going on in Syria on Russian and China, allegedly because we have been blocking something."" Russia and China -- major trade allies with Syria -- have vetoed tough resolutions on Syria at the U.N. Security Council. They have said they want a more balanced approach that calls on all sides to stop the violence. ""We are blocking ... only an attempt to support one side in an internal conflict by a U.N. Security Council decision,"" Lavrov said, RIA Novosti reported. More than 20,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict, the LCC said. The number is one of several overall estimates from various opposition groups and from the United Nations. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for example, said at one point this week that almost 17,000 people have died. Libyan rebels move onto Syrian battlefield . Securing Aleppo is key for the embattled regime and the anti-government fighters. One Free Syrian Army commander said the regime has labeled the confrontation for the city as the ""mother of all battles."" Regime forces are preventing fuel and food from entering Aleppo neighborhoods controlled by rebel fighters, opposition activists said. Rebels have had to set up medical clinics in homes. U.S. increasing contacts with Syrian rebels . ""They are besieging our area,"" said Abu Omar, a resident of the Salaheddin neighborhood. ""There is no electricity in some parts, and food is scarce."" Deama said the humanitarian situation is ""disastrous."" ""We have a bread crisis because the regime apparently ordered all bread bakeries closed. But in areas under the control of the Free Syrian Army, the FSA opened the bakeries and were able to employ people to bake bread then distribute it. There are also severe shortages in medications,"" she said. The United Nations and Western countries, fearing widespread death and destruction, have urged the Syrian government to call off an offensive in Aleppo. French President Francois Hollande reiterated his position calling for the U.N. Security Council to urgently intervene in Syria, a source in his entourage confirmed. Speaking in southwestern France, Hollande didn't specify what kind of intervention is needed. Heavy violence on Saturday wasn't limited to Aleppo. The LCC said dozens of people were killed across Damascus and its suburbs, and others died in Idlib, Deir Ezzor and Hama provinces. Syrian state-run media alluded to a possible showdown in Hama province. ""In a response to the constant pleas of the residents in the area, a unit from our armed forces started to cleanse Karnaz town in Hama from the armed terrorist gangs,"" Syrian state TV reported. The Syrian government has blamed violence in the country on vaguely defined armed terrorist gangs. Syrian rebels appear more capable, yet still outgunned . Fighting over the Syrian issue flared across the border in the Lebanese city of Tripoli on Saturday. At least 12 people were injured in clashes between Alawites and Sunnis. In Syria, Alawites, an offshoot of Shiism, dominate al-Assad's regime. While Sunnis have a significant presence in the Syrian regime, they are also dominant in the opposition movement. Friends of al-Assad's regime signaled their support for the embattled regime. Iran's energy minister, Majid Namjou, vowed his government ""will not leave Syria alone in such a difficult situation,"" according to state-run Press TV. The report said the two nations signed a deal Thursday to expand sharing of electricity and water, with Namjou saying Iranian firms are ready to rebuild damaged power plants. A.K. Lukashevich, the Russian foreign ministry spokesman, on Saturday reiterated his country's opposition to unilateral sanctions on Syria and won't agree to inspections of ships sailing under the Russia flag. Russia has been a longtime arms supplier to Syria, but it has said it will not deliver new weapons to Syria as long as the situation there is unstable. Lukashevich made the remarks after the latest round of European Union sanctions against the al-Assad regime. Syria has faced high-level diplomatic and military defections in recent months. The latest is Farouq Taha, the Syrian ambassador to Belarus. He confirmed the move on Al-Jazeera TV on Saturday. U.S. keeping an eye on Syria's weapons, al Qaeda's presence .

"(CNN) -- Just six weeks after the Australian Senate rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers, a government-appointed panel has recommended just that. The three-member panel, headed by former defense chief Marshal Houston, made 22 recommendations Monday on how the country should deal with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt to reach its shores each year. The report's release came after a particularly busy weekend for maritime authorities, who intercepted six separate boats carrying a total of 265 people in the three days to Sunday. It also came as officials investigated claims a boat carrying more than 60 asylum seekers had disappeared en route from Indonesia to Christmas Island, a popular entry point to Australia's asylum system. Read more: Asylum seekers risking all to escape dangers of home . Among the Houston report's recommendations was that offshore processing centers be established on the islands of Nauru and Papua New Guinea ""as soon as practical."" It also recommended an immediate increase in the number of people accepted each year for asylum from 13,750 to 20,000. In an effort to reduce the demand for family reunions, it recommended barring people who arrive by boat from being able to sponsor their families to join them. And rather than dumping the government's controversial and illegal ""Malaysia Solution,"" the report recommended building on the deal ""through high-level bilateral engagement focused on strengthening safeguards and accountability."" Under the so-called ""Malaysia Solution,"" Australia would have sent 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia for processing each year in exchange for 4,000 confirmed refugees. However, the High Court ruled the deal invalid last August on the grounds that, as a non-signatory to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act. Read more: Which countries take in most asylum seekers? Not the West . Hours after the report was released, Gillard gave her in-principle backing to all its recommendations and said that Parliament would meet Tuesday to amend the earlier rejected bill to include the provision for processing centers on Nauru and PNG. ""We will also move to immediately implement the recommendations on family reunion,"" she added. Refugee advocates reacted with outrage to the report, calling it a ""rebadging of the Pacific Solution,"" a reference to the former Liberal government's controversial policy of the last decade. ""At the heart of the panel's report is the policy of deterrence, but all deterrence does is divert people from our doorstep to dangers elsewhere. It doesn't address the circumstances, it just shifts the problem somewhere else,"" said David Manne, executive director of Australia's Refugee and Immigration Legal Center. ""What we need to do is promote proper protection standards in the region. There needs to be the understanding that it will take time, perseverance and patience. It will be incremental. There are no simple solutions,"" he added. The so-called Pacific Solution was introduced by former Prime Minister John Howard in 2001 and involved sending asylum seekers to detention centers on Pacific Island nations while their claims were processed. The current Labor government abandoned the policy when it took power in 2007. Since then, there has been a sharp increase in asylum seekers making the dangerous trip by boat to seek a new life in Australia. Between late 2001 and June this year, 964 asylum seekers and crew died at sea. Of those, more than 600 lost their lives in the last three years, according to the report. ""To do nothing is unacceptable -- so we have proposed a new approach. One that is comprehensive, integrated and equitable,"" said refugee expert and panel member Paris Aristotle. In a statement, Amnesty International's refugee spokesman Graham Thom said he was ""appalled"" by the panel's recommendations. ""Sending asylum seekers to places like Malaysia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea is unacceptable and a complete outsourcing of Australia's human rights obligations. ""The 'Pacific Solution' was a failed policy, and a wildly expensive one, that was internationally condemned for breaching the human rights of some of the world's most vulnerable people,"" he added. Manne said it was questionable whether Nauru would meet the requirements to be considered as a legally viable option for offshore asylum centers. ""Although Nauru and PNG have signed the Refugee Convention, neither country has its own laws in place to protect refugees nor are there any proper legal guarantees that refugees would be protected, and there are serious concerns about human rights conditions on the ground,"" he said. Australia's politicians have long been at odds over the country's official response to asylum seekers. While the opposition Coalition has backed the reopening of offshore centers, the move has been fiercely resisted by the Greens party which claims it breaches human rights. In late June, the senate rejected the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 which would have allowed Australia to send asylum seekers to Malaysia and Nauru for processing. Gillard said she is willing to compromise further to reach agreement and a policy on the issue. The panel estimated that if all the report's recommendations were adopted, they would cost US$1 billion to implement.","Australian expert panel recommends opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers .

"Olympic Park, London (CNN) -- ""Let it be known from this day forth, the Olympic movement has seen the creation of the first 'rock 'n' roll' Games, and London 2012 will be remembered for all time as the venue of its birth."" An affirmation that was not so much spoken by opening ceremony supremo Danny Boyle - film director and Oscar winner of ""Slum Dog Millionaire"" fame - but implied with so much of his vision for the 30th Olympiad curtain raiser. Music was the heartbeat of the $42.3 million spectacular, an aural backdrop arguably worthy of the ""Isle of Wonders"" hype, creating an almost tangible cultural DNA of what the organizers feel is to be British. From the androgynous swagger of David Bowie (his hit ""Heroes"" introduced Team GB to the stadium), to the drugged-out funk of the Happy Mondays; the rolling grooves of Soul II Soul's ""Back to Life"" to the punky-punch of The Prodigy's ""Firestarter""; the petulance of the Stones' ""Satisfaction"" to the raw, rebellious sound of the Sex Pistols; and form the staccato rap of Dizzee Rascal (born a stone's-throw from the Olympic Park) to euphoria of Underworld's bespoke-written tracks a montage of era-defining tunes were melded together to provide a snapshot of distinctly British sounds. And if all of that wasn't enough, music was also used to answer the biggest question that had hung over the event like a judge's gavel: How do you top Beijing? Easy, by getting a Beatle to end the show! Olympic opening ceremonies are often a anomalous mix of political grandstanding, national branding and artistic re-visioning of the global gathering that the Games represents. The response of London 2012 organizers to the grandiose opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, such was the scope and spectacular nature of the Chinese curtain-raiser, was always going to pique curiosity. It seemed apt to end the evening with the voice of one of the Fab Four, who had directly influenced many of the other acts who had performed earlier in the night. In fact, the Arctic Monkeys even sang Abbey Road's ""Come Together"" as part of their set. The Beatles may well be a band form another century but the 28 million people who follow the now defunct band's official Facebook page suggests they are loved the world over as much as ever. Beijing may have had an athlete running around the roof of the arena but London had McCartney play out with ""Hey Jude"" leaving television viewers from around the world no doubt humming a chorus that even language proves no barrier to: ""Nah, na, na , nananna nah, nananna nah ..."" etc. Put simply, it rocked: a spell-binding moment that touched the soul in the way the splendor of the Beijing opener failed to with such force. The vision had always been clear even back in the Bird's Nest Stadium -- when Led Zeppelin's legendary axeman Jimmy Page and stunning soul singer Leona Lewis belted out ""Whole Lotta Love"" from the top of a double-decker bus to provide soundtrack to the handing over of hosting duties from China. It may have been seen as a risk by many, but for some the tone and topic matter captured British idiosyncrasies well. Jamie Fullerton - features editor for the NME (New Musical Express), Britain's pre-eminent weekly music magazine, told CNN: ""What's really interesting is the set included bands like New Order and Happy Mondays, organizers tipping their hat towards the cult element of British rock 'n' roll music, which is very different to what you see at an event like the Superbowl. ""I think Britain likes to see itself as having a bit of edge. The Sex Pistols were only recording for a couple of years, but people bought into their rebellious nature the world over. It's funny how this anti-establishment band is now seen as one of the nation's great musical acts. There's also an element of embracing the outsider in Britain. New Order were the ultimate cult band, coming from Factory Records, a small independent record label, and being from Manchester. I would imagine most Americans aren't familiar with bands like New Order, so it's great to showcase them. ""The Olympics is a cultural event and the Games is about hammering home the sense of location as much as anything, it's natural for music to be a big part of that especially because it's so integral to our identity in Britain. ""As for The Beatles, they are the biggest band of all time. Their template is the one that was followed through the generations, and I think if you ask any visitor to Britain to name a few of the favorite things about this country, I'm sure the Beatles would still be one of them."" Statistics would also suggest that Boyle had been correct to assume that many around the world see British identity closely entwined with that of its musical exports. Sales of British music abroad reached $2.9 billion in retail value in 2011 with British artists accounting for almost 13% of global sales of recorded music, according to BPI (the representative body of the British Music Industry) figures. Compared to Britain's share of world trade in goods (2.7%), the trade of recorded music is four times the nation's average share of trade in services, accounting for 12.6% of the global market, according to figures from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In 2011 for example, Adele became the fourth British artist in five years to claim the best-selling artist album in the world, following in the footsteps of Amy Winehouse, Coldplay, and Susan Boyle. The Londoner's second album, 21, sold 18 million copies, accounting for 1.6% of all albums sold in the global music market that year. Thanks to the success of new faces on the scene, such as Tinie Tempah, Florence + the Machine, Hugh Laurie and Mumford & Sons, the BPI states that one in every eight albums sold this century in America alone were produced by a UK act. In Europe, British acts accounted for 52.7% of all sales. Geoff Taylor, the chief executive of BPI -- a body that represents independent and major record labels in the UK -- told CNN in a statement: ""I think British people are more obsessed by music than any other people in the world, they buy more CD albums per capita than any other nation, it's fundamental to our life. ""180 million singles were sold in the UK last year. We ran a survey last year to ask whether the UK population thought that we'd made an important contribution to world music.

""Without doubt we are a musical superpower, alongside the United States, and if anything the cultural influence of Britain's music is increasing as our communications are increasingly digital."" Ultimately, the success of the opening ceremony to the London 2012 Olympics can probably only be judged properly with the perspective of hindsight and when measured against the others that have gone before it. But, arguably, by putting popular music at the center of the showpiece Boyle, and the local organizers, focused on an area where Britain can still boast of superpower status.

"(CNN) -- Aiden O'Brien's superstar colt Camelot added the Irish Derby Saturday to his 2,000 Guineas and English Derby victories earlier this year. Ridden by his trainer's teenage son Joseph, the unbeaten son of Montjeu was doubtful for the showpiece Curragh clash because of the soft ground. But O'Brien's decision to run him paid off as he triumphed over Born To Sea. Camelot stormed to success in the English Derby earlier this month to put him in contention to become the first horse since Nijinsky to capture the English 'Triple Crown' of Thoroughbred racing: the 2,000 Guineas, the Epsom Derby and the St Leger Stakes. The legendary Nijinsky also won the Irish Derby en route to his historic treble in 1970. Camelot eyes horse racing immortality . O'Brien's gamble of running Camelot looked in doubt when Born To Sea mounted a strong challenge, but the colt dug deep to pull two lengths clear and give the trainer his seventh successive victory in the race. Camelot is also the first horse since High Chaparral in 2002 to complete the Epsom-Curragh Derby double. ""We really felt it wasn't the right thing (to run on this ground) but he's a great horse,"" O'Brien told gathered reporters. ""It doesn't get any better than this. These are days you can't dream of. He had the speed to win the Guineas, the class to win the Derby and then he had to have class, courage and stamina to win today. ""Obviously the lads will speak about the Triple Crown now, wouldn't it be something to dream about?"" Bookmakers have already installed Camelot as a 1-3 favorite for the final leg of the Triple Crown at Doncaster.","Camelot wins Irish Derby to continue his remarkable season .

"(CNN) -- A 44-year-old Alabama man has been indicted on 68 counts tied to a pair of shootings and other alleged crimes last month in and around Tuscaloosa, a district attorney announced Friday. Nathan Van Wilkins was first charged by authorities with 17 counts of attempted murder on July 17 tied to an early-morning shooting at a bar in Tuscaloosa, police Sgt. Brent Blankley said. At that time, he also faced another attempted murder charge for a shooting late on July 16 in a nearby subdivision, according to Blankley. After those charges were levied, Van Wilkins was ordered held in a county jail on a $2 million bond. A Tuscaloosa County grand jury then considered the case, returning a 68-count indictment on Thursday. The office of county District Attorney Tommy Smith detailed the charges in a press release Friday. The indictment alleges that Van Wilkins is responsible for shootings and other crimes at five locations. Victims of Alabama bar shooting improving . He is charged with 19 counts of attempted murder, 19 counts of assault in the first degree and 17 counts of assault in the second degree for shooting and wounding 19 people in Tuscaloosa and his hometown of Northport, the district attorney's office said. The Northport shooting occurred in a neighborhood residence, while the second happened about an hour later at the Copper Top bar near the University of Alabama's campus. Van Wilkins is charged on two counts of shooting into an occupied building related to both those incidents. Additionally, authorities say that Van Wilkins set fires in Northport and Brookwood at buildings and vehicles tied to his former employer, which was not named. The fire in Northport happened before the shootings, and multiple fires in Brookwood took place afterward, the district attorney's office said. For those alleged crimes, Van Wilkins is charged with two counts of second-degree arson, four counts of first-degree criminal mischief and three counts of attempted criminal mischief. The suspect also faces one count of fraudulent use of a credit card and one count of third-degree burglary, according to CNN affiliate WBRC. Tuscaloosa police Chief Steve Anderson said soon after the shootings that they were confident Van Wilkins was responsible ""based on some of the things he's told us."" On the afternoon of July 17, the suspect went into a business in Jasper, about 50 miles north of Tuscaloosa, and ""indicated he was involved in the incident,"" according to the police chief. As of of Friday, no weapon tied to the shootings has been recovered. But authorities have found at least 11 shell casings from the Copper Top bar scene, which they compared to those from the Northport neighborhood shooting. Alabama bar shooting suspect charged . Surveillance video showed a man walking up to the Tuscaloosa bar, standing outside for a few minutes looking for someone and then beginning to shoot a military-style assault rifle, Anderson said.

"(CNN) -- Two of the main companies involved in the disastrous 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill were more focused on personal injury risks than the potential for a major accident, a federal agency said in a report released Tuesday. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, an independent federal agency entrusted with investigating serious chemical accidents, released findings from their months-long analysis Tuesday at a public hearing in Houston. The CSB said two of the main companies involved, BP and Transocean, as well as U.S. regulators, focused too heavily on personal injury issues such as dropping objects, slips, trips and falls instead of on overarching considerations of importance, such as the potential of losing control of an oil well or drilling using a complicated rig. Three lessons linger from BP oil spill . The disaster began on April 20, 2010, when an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11 people and caused a three-month-long oil spill, sending nearly 5 million barrels of crude spewing into the Gulf. ""A number of past CSB investigations have found companies focusing on personal injury rates while virtually overlooking looming process safety issues -- like the effectiveness of barriers against hazardous releases, automatic shutoff system failures, activation of pressure relief devices, and loss of containment of liquids and gases,"" CSB Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso said. The agency said the oil industry had not learned key lessons from a 2005 blast at a BP refinery in Texas City -- an incident it said bears an ""eerie resemblance"" to the Deepwater Horizon disaster. During that incident, a fire and explosion during startup of a unit that raises gasoline octane killed 15 people and injured 180 others. Kevin Costner wins suit filed by Stephen Baldwin over oil cleanup machine . The CSB pointed out that during both occasions, workers were being congratulated for low rates of personal injuries on the very day that the explosions occurred. ""The emphasis on personal injury and lost work-time data obscures the bigger picture: that companies need to develop indicators that give them realistic information about their potential for catastrophic accidents. How safety is measured and managed is at the very core of accident prevention,"" said CSB investigator Cheryl MacKenzie. ""If companies are not measuring safety performance effectively and using those data to continuously improve, they will likely be left in the dark about their safety risks."" The Minerals Management Service (MMS), the now-defunct agency under the Department of the Interior that oversaw offshore oil exploration and production during the time of the 2010 accident, had already given BP and Transocean a total of 15 safety awards, and BP was a finalist for yet another. But CSB investigators found that the deciding factors used to determine recipients were based on personal safety records and not on safety management programs designed to prevent serious disasters. Ex-BP engineer says company records clear him in Gulf spill . The Interior Department subsequently dismantled the MMS and formed the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). Besides concluding that Transocean and BP had ""multiple safety management system deficiencies that contributed"" to the oil spill, the CSB also found the federal government should adopt some changes with its policies. In Tuesday's report, the agency concluded the Interior Department still needs to develop a better safety indicator program for reporting potential precursors to major incidents instead of just reporting accidents. The CSB is a Washington-based independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents. Board members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In April, BP announced that it had reached an estimated at $7.8 billion settlement with thousands of businesses and individuals who filed damage claims in the wake of the spill. Independent scientists have said the spill harmed marine life and bird populations as well as coral reefs in the Gulf. Other researchers said they have found at least one plume of hydrocarbons from the well deep below the surface. Alaska drilling: From 'hell no!' to...

"(CNN) -- Egyptian author Ahmed Mourad published his first novel in 2007, a political thriller on corruption in the regime of former president Hosni Mubarak. But he was taking a risk writing about the regime; his day job was as Mubarak's personal photographer. As the novel ""Vertigo"" is published for the first time in English, Mourad discussed the conflict he felt during 10 years photographing his president. ""I was with Mubarak in the mornings and wrote against him in the evenings,"" said Mourad. ""I felt it was the most dangerous decision I made by writing about Mubarak's regime and the people around him, but I would not forgive myself if I didn't write. I decided that if anything happened to me it was God's will."" Mourad, 33, was with Mubarak throughout the revolution and the 18 days of uprising that led to his resignation in February, and could not join the protesters in Tahrir Square. ""I was involved in my heart,"" he said. He will not discuss the period in detail, except to say it was ""horrible"" to be with Mubarak at that time, but says he will write a book about it in the future. Mubarak is currently on trial, accused of ordering the killing of protesters and corruption. He has denied the charges. Mourad said: ""It took courage to write about the regime while it was in power, but not once it is gone. ""Maybe in 10 years time -- or when everything has settled down -- I will write about it. ""I will write an eyewitness account as someone who worked with him for 10 years; the good and the bad. No one just has a bad side."" He added: ""The first half of Mubarak's era he was trying to be a good president, but in the last 10 to 13 years he began to relax and collect money, comfort and respect. He became a scarecrow, not a real president."" Mourad's novel ""Vertigo,"" which sold 11,000 copies in Egypt, features a society photographer who witnesses a multiple murder in a Cairo nightclub and is then forced to go into hiding in the ensuing cover-up. It ""exposes the seedy underbelly of life in Mubarak's Egypt,"" according to its English-language publisher Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation. Mourad subsequently wrote a second political thriller about corruption -- again while working for Mubarak -- which is currently being adapted into a film. He is currently working on his third novel, but will take a break from the political corruption theme. Mourad is still an official government photographer, waiting for a new president to take over from his former boss. He said: ""The corruption still happens. It's a time of corruption now because there's no president and no government. The regime is not in Mubarak, it's inside us all. We removed Mubarak, but we didn't remove the regime."" Voting has begun in the first phase of Egypt's parliamentary elections. Presidential elections are due to be held next year. Mourad hopes his next boss will be in power for only four years and will break the mold of Egyptian presidents becoming ""gods."" ""Ever since the Pharoahs, the king or president of Egypt has become a god, but that must change,"" he said. ""The next president must always remember what happened in Tahrir Square, what happened to Mubarak.""","Ahmed Mourad spent his days with president Hosni Mubarak and his evenings writing about his regime .

"(CNN) -- The Bahamas claimed a track and field Olympic medal, storming to gold in the 4x400m relay ahead of Team USA on Friday. Bahamas anchorman Ramon Miller ran an inspired final leg to overall America's Angelo Taylor and come home in a national record of two minutes 56.72 seconds. Trinidad and Tobago fended off a late surge from Great Britain to take the bronze. But there was disappointment for the South African team -- which included double-amputee Oscar Pistorius -- as they could only finish in eighth place. The U.S.'s women fared better in the sprint relay earlier in the evening taking the gold medal in the 4x100m for the first time since the 1996 Atlanta Games. The quartet, anchored by 100m silver medallist Carmelita Jeter, crossed the line in a time of 41.37 seconds, smashing the world record set by East Germany in 1985. ""I knew that these girls were going to run their hearts out,"" said Jeter. ""I knew we were running fast. I was already pointing at the clock, saying 'there it is'. There was a cloud hanging over us, with people saying 'they can't do this, they're going to drop the stick' but we did it,"" Jeter added.

"(CNN) -- ""Blade runner"" Oscar Pistorius can still dream of landing an Olympic medal after his South African team were awarded a place in Friday's 4x400m relay final despite failing to finish their qualification heat. South Africa's second leg runner Ofentse Mogawane went crashing to the track after tangling with Kenya's Vincent Kiilu and sustained a dislocated left shoulder. Pistorius, who was due to run the third leg Thursday was left a frustrated spectator, but South African officials immediately lodged an appeal, which was eventually upheld. ""IT'S ON!! We in the FINAL. Team management Protested as Ofentse was taken out and we have been given Lane 9!! @ljvanzyl to take his place!!!"" tweeted Pistorius after the decision by the Jury of Appeal. ""Will be up on the 3rd leg tomorrow for the Final! Really can't wait,"" he added. Track and field legend Johnson says Pistorius should not compete in Olympics . Pistorius made history when became the first double amputee athlete to compete in the Olympics as he contested the individual 400m earlier in the Games, reaching the semifinals. Running with special carbon fiber prosthetic limbs, Pistorius was initially prevented from competing against able bodied athletes by world governing body, the IAAF. The case went to the Court of Arbritration for Sport, who ruled in his favor in 2008. South Africa are among the favorites to land the 4x400m title after finishing second in last year's world championships in Daegu in the event. Pistorius, 25, ran in the qualification round in South Korea, but was controversially excluded from the final. He was still awarded silver medal, becoming the first amputee athlete to achieve that feat. After Mogawane's fall, which looked to have ended his chances of Olympic glory, he reacted in disbelief. ""I can't tell you how disappointed I feel. 11/10 if I had to give a number,"" he told BBC Sport. But soon a smile had returned to his face as news of their reinstatement came through. Pistorius will run the third leg of four with LJ van Zyl replacing the injured Mogawane. Kenya were disqualified but with South Africa's inclusion there will be nine teams in the final rather than the usual eight. The Bahamas and favorites the United States were the fastest qualifiers in two minutes 58.87 seconds in heat two.","South Africa awarded place in Friday's 4x400m relay final on appeal .

"(CNN) -- I love helping others plan a trip to South Africa. Not only does it give me a sense of home-turf pride, it's a beautiful country to visit that's great at looking after tourists. First, let's get a common misconception out of the way: Yes, there is a significant crime rate in some parts of the country, and you will need to be vigilant. But, the same can be said for almost any country worldwide. On to the good stuff. South Africa is a beautifully diverse country, racially and geographically. That being said, it's important to have a travel plan before you go. My ideal South African vacation would include a lengthy stop in Cape Town (my home town), a drive up the Garden Route and a safari. That way you get a bit of all the country has to offer. The mother city . The Cape Peninsula is characterized by a steep mountain range running down into the cool blue Atlantic. The most famous mountain in this range is called Table Mountain because it's flat like a table. To its left is Lion's Head and to its right is Devil's Peak. The view from the summit of Table Mountain is top of my list when visiting the Cape Town. You can get up and down by hiking or taking the cable car. Lines are long, so if you're going during the day, get there early. I highly recommend taking a picnic up to the top an hour or so before sunset and taking the last car down. Cape Town is known for its red and orange skies at sundown, and Table Mountain provides the perfect panoramic view. My best advice for people visiting Cape Town would be to group outings together by location. Cape Point is a bit of a drive away, but I find it well worth it to see where the cold Atlantic Ocean meets the warm Indian Ocean. Just be mindful of the baboons -- they're cheeky! It's easy to stop in Simonstown, Kalk Bay or even Fish Hoek for lunch or a snack on the way back. The Brass Bell and the Black Marlin are two local eateries that have stunning views. A visit to Robben Island is also likely to take a whole day. Book a ferry ticket in advance and be sure to check the weather report. Visiting this island, which was used as a prison for centuries, is very humbling and shouldn't be missed. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island for 18 years. Another interesting day trip is an outing to the wine farms. See whether your hotel can organize a driver for you. I love Fairview, which has a great restaurant and affordable wines. They also have a goat pen to entertain children, and of course, delicious goat cheese available for tasting with your wine. Some other well-known vineyards include Spier, Thelema, Delaire Graff, Delheim, Asara and Zevenwacht. I also like visiting the small university town of Stellenbosch. Its quaint, tree-lined streets provide some shelter from the heat, and it's a great place to stop for coffee or a meal on your way back to the city. Can you tell South Africans like to eat? Back in the city, it's really worth it to check out some local flavors. Greenmarket Square is in the middle of the central business district and is a great place to find some authentic carvings and crafts. There are plenty of great places to eat there, too. Try Mama Africa or Africa CafÃ© if you're looking for strictly African food. Long Street usually starts buzzing as the sun goes down. Running the length of downtown Cape Town, Long Street is home to backpacker lodges, hip clothing boutiques, funky restaurants and amazing night life. Exploring outside the city . Once you've had your fill of the Cape Town area, take a drive up the Garden Route. This stretch of highway runs up South Africa's eastern coast and is well-known for its breathtaking views and whale-watching vantages. Completing the trek in three or four days gives you ample time to stop as you want along the way. For overnight destinations, I recommend Cape Agulhas (to say you've been to the southernmost tip of Africa), Knysna (great for whale watching if you're there in the spring) and Plettenberg Bay. There are beautiful beaches along this stretch of coastline, as well as lush rainforests and winding mountain passes. For the more adventurous, bungee jumping off the Bloukrans Bridge is a must -- it's the tallest bridge jump in the world! As for the safari portion, Addo Elephant National Park boasts all the big five (elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, buffalo) and is conveniently at the end of the Garden Route. Alternatively, you could visit Kruger National Park. Arguably the country's most well-known game reserve, Kruger offers multiple accommodation options (ranging from camping to a fabulous lodge) and is well-prepared for tourists. If you'd prefer to do something a little more intimate, Phinda, Hluhluwe-Umfolozi and Sabi Sands are beautiful. The best way to see game is on drives. Most parks offer drives early morning or at sunset. Dress warmly if you're going in the morning and take bug spray if you're going at night. Another way to observe the wildlife is at a watering hole. Most parks have huts or viewing areas around big holes where you can watch animals undisturbed. South Africans are a very friendly and helpful bunch. We love helping people, especially tourists, and if you enjoy something along the way, we'll likely ask you to tell your friends back home. Take your time while traveling. we tend to move pretty slowly, but it means we enjoy every moment and I hope you'll do the same.","South Africa is a beautifully diverse country .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 2 Petra Kvitova secured her first WTA Tour title of 2012 by defeating former French Open champion Li Na in Monday's final of the Rogers Cup. Key to the Czech Republic's 7-5 2-6 6-3 victory was her decisive break of serve in the final set to condemn her Chinese opponent to a third final loss of the year -- following Li's reverses in Sydney and Rome. It was Kvitova's first appearance in a final this season and the win meant she won a Tour event for the first time since the season-ending championships in Istanbul last October. ""The first set was a really big fight -- every game was very close,"" world No. 5 Kvitova told the WTA Tour's official website. ""Maybe I was a little bit lucky to win the first set. She played very well in the second set. She was very aggressive without any mistakes."" Kvitova's triumph in Montreal was all the more impressive considering the 22-year-old suffers from asthma, which usually adversely affects her performances in North America due to the summer humidity. ""I have asthma so I have trouble breathing sometimes, but it wasn't too humid here this week,"" she explained after reaching her first final on the continent. ""It's only a problem in North America, unfortunately, because here it's more humid than Europe or Australia, where it's very hot but not that humid. Humidity is the main problem for me. ""But it's great to know I can play well here and it's great I finally won a title this year. I'm so glad it could be here at the Rogers Cup in Montreal."" Desite the loss, Li showed glimpses of the form which made her China's first grand slam singles champion at Roland Garros last year. At the start of the second set Li, who has returned to the top 10 of the world rankings of the back of her performances in Canada, won 16 points in a row. ""I really have to say she played very well today. I think we both played a very good match,"" Li said of her opponent. ""I'm very happy because this was the first hard-court tournament after the Olympics, and my new coach is going to come to Cincinnati, so I think this is a very good start to this season for me."" Li recently started working with Justine Henin's former coach Carlos Rodriguez.","Petra Kvitova beats Li Na to win the Rogers Cup in Montreal .

"London (CNN) -- Olympic star Ryan Lochte said Friday that he tries to maintain a sense of humor and perspective despite his intense focus on swimming -- one that leaves him little time for romantic relationships or much else besides training and competing. In an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Lochte showed off one of his grills, which he said shows ""part of my personality."" Just one of the jewel-encrusted items that often adorn his teeth is reportedly worth $25,000. ""I am taking this seriously, but there's so much more to life than just swimming,"" he said. ""That's what I want to have people know: You know what, I'm having fun doing this."" Still, free time for the 28-year-old -- who has been called one of the Olympics' most eligible bachelors -- has been severely limited over the past decade. When asked ""who gets more women,"" he or rival and fellow American swimmer Michael Phelps, Lochte said he does by a ""60/40"" margin. Still, the swimmer -- whose mother, Ike Lochte, created a media hubbub recently when she said her son only had time for ""one-night stands,"" which he explained had to do with sporadic dates and not sexual flings -- said it is hard for him to cultivate a long-term relationship given his training regimen. Phelps leads U.S. gold rush in pool . ""I am young, but that's not me,"" Lochte said of one-night stands. ""I like being in relationships. When I am in a relationship, I want to give (a woman) my entire heart,"" he added. ""And lately I haven't been able to do that just because swimming has taken such a big role in my life."" If he could choose anyone to whisk away to a deserted island, the Rochester, New York, native didn't hesitate as to who he'd pick: ""Gossip Girl"" actress Blake Lively. ""She is gorgeous,"" he said of Lively, who is currently dating actor Ryan Reynolds. As to what he'd say to her if they met, Lochte jokingly said, ""I would be like, 'Hi ... You want to go to an island with me?'"" Lochte entered the London Games as one of his nation's most highly touted athletes, having won two golds and two bronze medals four years earlier in Beijing and threatening to topple Phelps from his perch atop the swimming world this year. London 2012: Live blog . Immediately, he made a splash by defeating Phelps and others for the 400-meter individual medley gold on the day after the opening ceremony. His luster was tarnished slightly the next day when France's Yannick Angel chased him down on the final leg of the 4X200-meter freestyle relay to win that race. That silver was better, though, than his result Monday when he finished fourth in the 200-meter freestyle individual race. Lochte rebounded with two medals on Thursday -- bronze in the 200-meter backstroke and a silver in the 200-meter individual medley, this time finishing right behind Phelps. The next day, the swimmer acknowledged to CNN that he's had ""ups and downs"" during the London Games but overall, he's satisfied with his performance. ""I'm happy,"" he said. ""I'm coming back to my country with five Olympic medals. And that's amazing right there."" Bold move put Gabby on path to gold . Getting to this point hasn't been easy. Lochte pointed to his exhaustive focus on swimming over the past eight years, involving ""a lot, a lot of early morning practices ... going into a freezing cold pool."" But he said that it's all been worth it to put on a swim cap adorned with an American flag, and especially when his national anthem is played after a gold medal performance . ""It's everything -- chills, excitement, knowing that I'm not just swimming for myself, I'm swimming for my whole entire country. It's one of the greatest feelings in the world,"" Lochte said. ""There's nothing like it. It's something that you will cherish for the rest of your life.""","U.S. swimmer has won 5 medals at the 2012 London Olympics, after winning four in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- A private memorial service is planned Saturday for British film director Tony Scott, who apparently committed suicide this week in California. Scott, best known for the films ""Top Gun"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop II,"" jumped from a bridge in San Pedro, authorities said. His death led to reports that the British director suffered from inoperable brain cancer, but his family disputed that he was ailing. Scott, 68, wrote two notes before his death, including a message left in his Los Angeles office for family members, a coroner official said. A second note detailing contact information was found in his Toyota Prius parked nearby, but the notes did not provide a motive for why he took the suicidal plunge, authorities said. The notes also did not mention any illnesses, diseases or other health issues, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. He declined to provide additional details on what the notes entailed. It will be weeks before the findings from an autopsy are made public, the coroner's office said. ""Our examination is complete, and we will be working towards a comprehensive document once we close the case,"" Winter said. An ABC report Monday suggested the director was told by a doctor that he was dying of inoperable brain cancer. The network did not name the source of its information. ""I did talk to the family ... and according to his wife, he did not have brain cancer as reported, and (she) does not know who told ABC that information, which is absolutely false,"" Winter said. Scott cemented his reputation for big-budget action films with 1990's ""Revenge"" starring Kevin Costner and ""Days of Thunder"" with Tom Cruise. In 1998, he directed ""Enemy of the State"" with actors Will Smith and Gene Hackman. His reputation in Hollywood was low-key. ""He wasn't a showy kind of guy,"" longtime entertainment reporter Jeanne Wolf said. While Scott's movies garnered box office success, they never received the acclaim that generated Academy Award nominations. In 2002, Scott and his brother Ridley won an Emmy for the television movie ""The Gathering Storm."" Scott also was nominated for the Emmy as a producer for the CBS drama ""The Good Wife.""

"Flint, Michigan (CNN) -- Relatives of a former U.S. Marine jailed in Iran for allegedly spying for the CIA say they are pleading with the leaders of the Islamic Republic to show mercy and set Amir Mirzaei Hekmati free. ""I just want to ask President (Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, these two are our only hope. These two can bring Amir home,"" pleaded Behnaz Hekmati, Amir's mother. ""We just want (him) to come home, I think one year is enough. If you want to punish us, if you want to punish Amir, for whatever reason he is there, just one year is enough. Please let him come home,"" his mother added. With reluctance and much apprehension, the Hekmati family opened their home to CNN and sat down for an exclusive interview, their first since Hekmati was arrested on August 29, 2011. ""The struggle is the lack of communication,"" said Sarah Hekmati, Amir's sister, ""going from talking to someone daily, weekly, and visiting on holidays to absolutely nothing and not knowing what's going on."" Amir Hekmati, 29, was born in Arizona, and was raised in Nebraska and Michigan. His family described him as an all-American guy with a yearning to travel and a love of languages. They said he is an outgoing, athletic individual who joined the military to help his family financially and a man who is proud of his service in Iraq. Mother of accused U.S. spy says Iranian charges are false . His family says he wanted to learn more about his culture and heritage. This was his first trip to Iran and he was looking forward to visiting with relatives, especially the maternal grandmother who helped raise him. But after two weeks in Iran, Hekmati was arrested, and his family says he was not charged with anything for months. But in December of last year Amir's parents say they were shocked to see a video broadcast on Iranian TV showing their son confessing to espionage. In the edited and highly produced video, Hekmati utters his name in English speaks in Farsi describing his work as a U.S. Marine and seeming to confirm the allegations of the Iranian government that he was an Iranian-American working as a CIA agent. ""They forced him to do that. That's not true,"" said Hekmati's mother, referring to the alleged confession. ""They knew he was a military (soldier) because he told the Embassy of Iran he was in the military,"" she adds, explaining that her son checked with Iranian authorities in the United States before making the trip. ""He's not a spy, he's not working for the CIA, we know that, we are sure, absolutely,"" Behnaz Hekmati said. The U.S. State Department also denies Hekmati was spying for the U.S. government and calls this case a gross miscarriage of justice. ""We never thought he should have been arrested. We've been trying, because he's a dual U.S.-Iranian national, we've been trying to get access to him since he was originally locked up,"" said State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland. ""The Iranians have never allowed us to go to see him."" Amir's mother has traveled to Iran three times and has been granted limited visits. She described her son as disheartened and completely confused as to why he was arrested. ""He is skinny, pale, like a chalk, his face was like chalk. Hair was shaved, had a beard, he walked like this and the feet was together he walked like a robot,"" she said. ""He couldn't stop crying and he was (saying) 'I don't know why I'm here,' Mom."" The Hekmatis say their son now has a government- approved lawyer in Iran although contact with him has been sporadic. A lower court in Iran sentenced Hekmati to death in January, but the nation's Supreme Court annulled that sentence less than two months later and ordered a retrial. The lower court previously had convicted Hekmati of ""working for an enemy country,"" as well as membership in the Central Intelligence Agency. The Hekmatis now believe their son will be granted a retrial, but no date has been set and the family says they have very little information about the legal process. For Amir's twin sister, Leila, the worry and the waiting have been all too overwhelming. She read from a card he wrote her on their joint birthday last year, before he went to Iran: ""'(T)ime has passed but one thing hasn't changed and that's the bond I share with my twin sister. I will never be alone no matter where I am.' ""At night I just think about him; I feel so helpless. I feel like I can't do anything. Just please, bring him home,"" she pleaded, hoping Iranian leaders will hear her. Ali Hekmati, Amir's father, said he believes the best chance they have of bringing Amir home soon is appealing to the Iranian leaders directly. ""It's going to take some cooperation from Iranian leaders,"" he said. ""The leadership needs to show some leniency and some cooperation in helping out a crying mother and sister and a father who loves his son dearly. ""I miss Amir very much,"" he said. Can Iran and America be friends? CNN's Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.","Family members of a former Marine jailed in Iran give CNN an exclusive interview .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Investigators targeted Lindsay Lohan and her assistant as suspects in a Hollywood burglary, but the district attorney decided Tuesday there was not enough evidence to prosecute them. ""Lindsay is glad this matter has been cleared up so she can focus on her upcoming projects,"" her publicist said in a statement sent to CNN soon after the district attorney's office released a summary of the investigation. ""It is unfortunate that many media outlets were quick to point fingers and jump to conclusions without having all the facts."" Celebrity news website TMZ previously quoted an unidentified law enforcement source saying Lohan and her assistant, Gavin Doyle, were suspects in the burglary. The prosecutor's report confirmed the actress and Doyle were suspects, along with another man identified as Andrew Payan. The people burglarized are Sam Magid, a wealthy investor who the investigation report said ""had a longstanding relationship"" with Lohan, and a woman who was staying in his Hollywood Hills home. Sheen and Lohan to die in 'Scary Movie 5'? Missing from the home and the woman's car were cash, house keys, sunglasses and a credit card holder, the report released by the Los Angeles County District Attorney said. Lohan had been denied entry into the home at 2:45 a.m. on Saturday, August 18, according to a security guard, the report said. ""What, is he in there f--king some other girl!?"" the guard quoted the actress as saying. Magid called for police five hours later when he saw a suspicious man, who the report said resembled Doyle, outside the home. He and his female friend declined to prosecute after Lohan was identified as a suspect, the report said. The detective on the case saw Lohan's car parked at Magid's home three days later, it said. He stopped the car as she was leaving and found Lohan in a BMW with Doyle, Payan and a juvenile. Doyle acknowledged to the detective that he, Lohan and Payan had been at Magid's house twice in the early morning of the day the items were reported missing. Doyle said ""he ate some meatballs and drank some vodka, but did not take anything at the residence,"" the report said. Doyle ""said one of them did take property"" but he ""would not reveal who took the property at the residence,"" it said. This was not enough to persuade the district attorney's office to prosecute the case. ""One of the suspects makes a vague admission that he and the others were there, and that 'someone' took something but is not more specific than that,"" the report said. The victims ""indicated that they are not willing to prosecute anyone for this burglary"" and there was not ""sufficient evidence to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt."" The story becomes another chapter in more than six years of brushes with the law for Lohan, who is attempting a career comeback after stints in rehab, jail and home confinement. She remains on probation for a shoplifting conviction last year. Lindsay Lohan's exhaustion triggers union inquiry .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was heading to Asia on Thursday for a wide-ranging trip that will take her from the Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean to China and Russia farther north. The State Department says the week-and-a-half-long trip is intended to emphasize a strong, long-term U.S. focus on the entire Asia-Pacific region. ""It is a very long, very diverse trip, but the concurrent themes that run through this is a strong, determined effort on the part of the United States to underscore our rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific region, to make clear that we're here to stay, that we are engaged on an array of issues -- strategic, political, commercial,"" a senior State Department official told reporters ahead of the trip. ""It spans not just Asia, not just Northeast Asia but Southeast Asia and, increasingly, the Pacific,"" the official said. Syrian crisis: Clinton talks contingency plans with Turkey . Clinton's first stop will be the Cook Islands, host of this year's Pacific Islands Forum, one of the region's most significant political institutions. She plans to talk with leaders there about regional challenges with health issues and climate change, as well as commercial interests and problems like illegal fishing. After that, Clinton plans to head to Indonesia, which is emerging as a major player in the ASEAN, or Association of Southeast Asian Nations, regional forum, and to Beijing, where the official said a full range of U.S.-China issues will be on the table -- including developments on the Korean Peninsula and in Iran, Syria and Afghanistan. Among the other items on the Beijing agenda may be the dispute that flared earlier this month over the South China Sea. Countries like Vietnam and the Philippines lay claim to some areas of the South China Sea, but China has declared ""indisputable sovereignty"" over all of it. When the U.S. State Department earlier this month urged more Chinese diplomacy in the dispute, China blasted Washington for confounding the issue. ""I think one of the messages that we seek to carry on this trip is that it is absolutely essential that cooler heads prevail in every capital,"" the senior State Department official said. The official said the best place for dialogue on the South China Sea is between China and the ASEAN forum. Clinton: Iran's proposal are 'non-starters' Clinton may also have to deal with another long-running maritime dispute, this one involving a group of islands in the East China Sea claimed by China, Japan and Taiwan. Furious anti-Japan protests erupted across China this month when a Japanese group sailed to one of the disputed islets and symbolically waved Japanese flags. The State Department official said the United States is ready to play a ""steady outside role"" when it comes to such decades-long territorial disputes in Asia. After Beijing, Clinton plans a commercially focused visit to East Timor, visiting a coffee plantation to highlight the decade-old nation's economic development. A brief visit to Brunei will follow, where Clinton plans to ""renew friendships"" while sitting down for dinner with Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The official said Brunei has been a very helpful partner to the United States in the Middle East and with educational initiatives, and that it seeks more commercial collaboration with the United States. Closing out Clinton's trip will be a visit to Russky Island off Vladivostok, Russia, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. In particular, Clinton plans to discuss intellectual property issues and hold meetings on a new Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade group that came up during last year's APEC summit in Hawaii, the official said. Japan, Canada and Mexico were among the nations that last year expressed interest in the partnership. Clinton is also expected to talk with her Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, about issues including Syria, Iran and the Balkans, the official said. Clinton warns Sinai could turn into jihadist haven .","The trip begins in the Cook Islands for the regional Pacific Islands Forum .

"(CNN) -- Look at the goals Ivan Rosales has set for himself and you'll see an example of the American ambition that makes our nation great. Ivan is a recent graduate of California State University in San Bernardino, and is about to start a master's program in bioethics at New York University. But that's just a steppingstone on his path, he hopes, to medical school, where he wants to study oncology. Along the way, he'd also like to join the military and serve our country as an Army medic. Sounds like a guy you'd want as your neighbor (or your doctor), right? In America: Program granting work rights for childhood immigrants begins . Well, there's a catch: Ivan was born in Mexico and came to the United States when he was 8 months old. Although two older siblings were born here and are citizens, Ivan is an undocumented immigrant. But the Obama administration saw that America was losing out when people like Ivan could not reach their full potential because of their immigration status. The administration announced June 15 that it would consider requests for ""deferred action"" -- that is, a stay of deportation proceedings -- for young people who came to the United States before age 16, were 30 or younger as of June 15, have lived in the United States for at least five years, have graduated or are enrolled in school or were honorably discharged from the military, have stayed out of trouble and pass a background check. Excitement has been building among eligible young people during the 60 days U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had to work out the details. The agency published the request forms Tuesday and is accepting requests starting Wednesday. ""Deferred action for childhood arrivals,"" as it is officially called, lifts the immediate threat of deportation proceedings from about 1 million aspiring citizens who see America as their only home. It does so at no cost to taxpayers; applicants must pay a $465 fee, which will cover the program's cost. But it does more than that. It is the first step toward the creation of a new immigration process that recognizes the contributions of new Americans â€” whatever their provenance â€” to our country and our culture. In Ivan's case, that means getting an education that allows him to treat people who are fighting America's No. 2 killer. He knows a few cancer survivors; he tells me he has known too many others who have died. Already as an undergraduate, Ivan did stem-cell research that could lead to new cancer treatments. For the next two years, at least, Ivan will be able to work legally to help pay for graduate school. He can apply for internships and volunteer without worry. What is most meaningful to Ivan? ""I'll be able to have a valid ID,"" he tells me. ""That's the most overwhelming thing. Even something that simple will give me a sense of actually belonging."" Ivan and his peers will be America's next generation of entrepreneurs and farm workers, engineers and assembly-line employees, inventors, nurses, teachers -- and doctors. If they aren't curing you, they might be hiring you, teaching your children or keeping food on your table. They are good for America. We are at our best when we encourage and reward hard work, not question it. We are at our strongest when we lift aspirations, not when we stifle them. We also must treat this positive step as an initial accomplishment, not a final one. As Ivan and other aspiring citizens move closer to achieving their dreams, all of us must come together and move Congress to pass a permanent road map to citizenship for all who pledge allegiance to our country. Wednesday is a day of new promise, new confidence and new opportunity to preserve and strengthen the American dream â€” not just for Ivan but for all of us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Noorani.","Ali Noorani: To see the promise of immigrant ambition, look to the goals of Ivan Rosales .

"(CNN) -- When Spanish-language network Univision blasted the Commission on Presidential Debates for its glaring lack of ethnic diversity among the four presidential and vice presidential debate moderators, champions of diversity applauded the network's willingness to challenge the status quo. In many ways, Univision was echoing the famous words written in the first edition of the nation's first black newspaper, Freedom's Journal, founded by John B. Russwurm and Samuel Cornish in 1827: ""We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us."" There is no doubt that choosing a woman to moderate a presidential debate for the first time in 20 years -- CNN's Candy Crowley -- is long overdue. But with this nation quickly becoming a majority-minority country, the perspective, background and interests of those asking the questions is seriously important. Part of the diversity problem with the presidential moderators also stems from the lack of diversity in the media, especially in the power positions of executives, show hosts and executive producers. And our nation's media is quick to examine another industry's shortcomings and pay only lip service to its own. It's great that after Univision's critique, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney decided to participate individually in an issues forum hosted by the network's anchors, Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas. To all of the haters who are seething right now -- readying their e-mails and composing comments such as ""Why can't we all just be Americans?"" and ""You're race-baiting with this column"" -- please, pipe down and listen for a change, to understand the nuances of this issue. In the media, whenever we say ""mainstream,"" we might as well be honest and admit that means white. I have heard cable and broadcast executives speak in those terms for years, and trust me, when they are thinking about the dominant audience, it means white. That's why when anyone is talking about media that targets demographics other than white, you'll hear the phrase ""ethnic media."" For newspapers targeting African Americans, you'll hear ""the black press."" What we have to acknowledge is that the moderator's background, upbringing, experiences and where he or she grew up, all play a crucial role in what questions are asked. If you take people who grew up in a nearly all-white environment in the suburbs and they have spent their adulthood in similar surroundings, their outlook on life and the issues won't be the same as those who grew up in a nearly all-white rural environment. Their education, health and economic concerns likely will be drastically different. The same goes for someone is African American, Hispanic-Latino, Asian or Native American. Our ethnicity shouldn't be divisive; our diversity is what makes us unique, and that means embracing it. That ethnic and regional perspective is also important in other ways. For instance, conservatives always lament the ""East Coast liberals"" who work for major media companies. But the truth is that the notion of what's important in Washington and New York is much the same in conservative outlets as it is in liberal outlets in those cities. For years, I've felt out of place as a native Texan within these media circles. How I view the issues is different from who decides the top news of the day in places such as New York or Washington. Add on that I'm African-American, and my outlook varies a great deal from a lot of TV newsbookers, producers, executive producers, hosts, editorial opinion page editors and national political correspondents. My background plays a role in the way I view the world, and that comes across based on the issues I choose to highlight and discuss. For example, when I'm on CNN's ""Starting Point With Soledad O'Brien,"" and we're choosing a story of the day in the newspaper, I purposely don't choose anything from The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times or any New York papers. Why? Because those are the daily papers read by most folks in the media. Why do I want to reinforce the narrative that those papers decide what's most important? I'll choose to grab something in The Detroit News, Chicago Sun-Times, Houston Chronicle, The Charlotte Observer, The Plain Dealer (Cleveland) or websites, magazines and blogs produced for ethnic audiences to spread the love and expand the universe of what is news. These debates should be the same. There should be ethnic and gender diversity among the moderators. Who they are and the questions they ask should be broad in scope, but also specific to various groups that make up the United States of America. Let's stop asking questions only about the middle class or the nation's rich. Can someone actually mention the poor in this country, which is made of up people of all ethnic groups? Can we hear the candidates talk about why the United States has more prisoners than any other nation in the world and why blacks and Hispanics make up a disproportionate number of them? Is racial profiling too provocative to be put on the table? Is the education achievement gap too toxic to bring up? How about health disparities between rural and city folk, and whites, blacks and Hispanics? Sorry to say, if your questioners are all white, most of these questions won't be on their index cards. I don't want to hear a presidential or vice-presidential candidate's favorite TV show, food, hobby or most embarrassing thing they've ever done. Such silly questions should be barred forever. But we can have debates that are not just substantive, but culturally relevant. The point isn't about a gotcha question or trying to get someone to slip up. It's simply recognizing that the next president and vice president of the United States will represent one nation, 50 states and 300 million people of many hues, shapes and perspectives. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Spanish-language Univision blasted lack of diversity among debate moderators .

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- Americans consume more than 19 million barrels of oil a day as well as tons of coal and natural gas, raising questions about the future availability of those resources and the environmental impact of their development and use. President Barack Obama has heavily pushed an alternative energy agenda, his administration pouring billions of taxpayer resources into solar, wind and battery initiatives aimed at cutting dependence on foreign oil and changing how Americans view and use energy. In a new policy paper, his Republican rival for the White House, Mitt Romney, says, ""President Obama has intentionally sought to shut down oil, gas, and coal production in pursuit of his own alternative energy agenda."" Romney wants more oil exploration, faster permitting, and state control of exploration on federal lands. It all adds up to the Republican refrain: ""Drill, baby, drill."" Fact check: Obama education ad misleading . ""I will set a national goal of American and North American energy independence by 2020,"" Romney pledges. But Obama says not so fast . ""Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years -- at any time,"" Obama says. So who is telling the truth? Despite a moratorium on offshore drilling prompted by the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico two years ago, domestic oil production has surged. Oil shale and natural gas production are also up sharply. However, much of this was set in motion years before Obama took office. While Obama has taken some steps to encourage production, he cannot claim as much credit as he would like. Obama has, for sure, angered some oil and coal producers by steering federal money to alternative energy sources. But there is no evidence that he is trying to ""shut down"" traditional energy industries. It is also not clear that Romney's plans would bring energy independence that much quicker, especially without a simultaneous focus on reducing consumption. So on both sides, the arguments run out of gas. Romney's claim that Obama is trying to kill off old energy is false. And Obama's claims of what he has accomplished are muddled. We rate them both misleading. Fact check: Romney's welfare claims wrong .","Mitt Romney pledges energy independence for North America by 2020 .

"(CNN) -- Mitt, . We've never met but I, too, spent a decade or so in private equity, made some money and moved on to other things while retaining ties to many people in the industry (including some of your former colleagues at Bain Capital). So, it pains me to see you trying to win despite your private equity background rather than because of it. Although your interview with Piers Morgan was a baby step in the right direction, you still need to stop pussy-footing around about when you did (or did not) leave Bain, or whether you will (or will not) release your tax returns. Be a man and make an honest case for why you should be the first private-equity president! Here's what you should say: . ""Like most private equity guys, I was a white, male, something-cum-laude, Ivy League-type who spent my early career in management consulting and Harvard Business School before getting into the business, where I quickly made some serious money. ""Unlike my cousin Kleiner and his friends who work in Silicon Valley, I was not a venture capitalist who made my money starting companies or inventing things. Unlike Mayor Mike Bloomberg, I was not an entrepreneur who made my money building a company. Unlike folksy Warren Buffett, I was not a long-term investor who made my money from owning companies. And unlike my younger brother Hedge, I didn't make my money because I was really, really smart. (Hedge was a physics professor before starting his fund and still plays chess at a high level but he's too weird to be president.) ""No, I made most of my money from buying and selling a dozen or so companies with other people's money; mostly uninteresting mid-sized companies that nobody particularly wanted; and I got to keep 20% of the difference between the purchase and sale price plus any cash I could take out while I owned them. ""And I now recognize that this short-term buying and selling made me about as knowledgeable about business as George Steinbrenner was about playing baseball. I was an expert at telling business people how to do what I'd never done myself. And to tell you the truth, back when I was in private equity most 'real' businessmen -- the people running our largest companies and the entrepreneurs starting new businesses -- had about as much respect for money guys like me as Dave Winfield had for George -- close to zero. ""But despite the bashing it has taken in the press, I'm proud of our private equity system. It plays the vital role of flowing 'risk money' from large investors, mostly large pension funds and the wealthy, into situations where it can be put to good use. Money that allows companies to pursue activities that, while potentially rewarding, involve taking technology, market and operational risks. ""Our country needs investment to create economic growth, improve living standards and increase productivity. Risk money is particularly important not only because of its direct benefits -- profits for successful companies, new and improved products, employment and knowledge -- but also because it gives individuals and institutions the opportunity to exercise their rights to buy, to sell and to pursue their dreams. ""And only independent organizations like Bain have proven able to get the job done because the other candidates for doing the job -- government, angels, banks -- have proven too stupid, too lazy, too small or too bureaucratic. ""Unfortunately everything worth doing can be overdone and sometimes I went from taking risks that were already there to making risks that weren't. Why? Because the company I wanted to buy was too boring, too well run, or too expensive to give me a decent chance of making real money unless I increased the level of risk. And this risk, usually excessive borrowing that I forced the company to take on (usually so that I could buy it) was borne by the company and its employees, customers and vendors with occasionally dire consequences. ""I'm sick to death of making lame excuses -- 'it's all part of creative destruction,' 'the market made me do it,' 'bankruptcy is no big deal,' 'I'd already left Bain when it happened' -- I admit it and, as I told Piers, I felt terrible when a business failed, but risk-making was a small part of what I did. ""While experts disagree about whether I created any lasting value, there is no doubt that I extracted it wherever possible. Private equity guys are always on the lookout for opportunities to extract value from customers (can we charge more for less?), from vendors (can we pay them later?), from employees (can we outsource to India!), from sellers (can we partner up in the next auction?) and from buyers (can we push the accountants harder?). ""Extraction probably makes things more efficient, and I got to my keep 20% of the extract, but it can be a nasty business. ""I worked hard and am pretty talented, but a large part of how I got so rich was just the dumb luck of joining an industry that was an almost perfectly designed money machine during what turned out to be a 20-year bull run. ""The funds are so large (per person) that even mediocre performance supports big paydays as profits are shared by very few people; the widespread use of borrowed money leads to cycle-driven windfalls even when no value is created over time, and I helped make a lot of other people rich, too, since I created a steady stream of corporate transactions (purchases, sales, mergers, refinancings and restructurings) that generated enormous fees for the bankers, lawyers and consultants for whom private equity is the gift that keeps on giving. ""In private equity, I was surrounded by guys just like me and this can still make it hard for me to relate to regular people. I almost never dealt with women or minorities as true partners. And I'm still perplexed when people don't share my passion for money, efficiency and numbers. ""Weirdly, I don't even feel like I'm in the top .1% given that so many of my friends have a lot more money than me. (That's why I find it so hard to shake my politically suicidal resistance to closing the 'carried interest' tax loophole that has already allowed me and my friends to pocket billions in tax-advantaged compensation.) ""One last thing you probably already know: I wasn't very nice. I always acted in my own economic interest, I quantified everything, I thought creatively about what could be done (not what should), I treated people as means not ends, and I regularly did to others what I would never want done to myself, my friends or my family. You'll have to ask the secretaries, middle managers, nannies and limo drivers what kind of man I really was or how I compared to the other effortlessly superior hotshots who roamed private equity's hallowed halls. But I did some things I'm now ashamed of (the picture with dollars overflowing my pockets) and I still have the habit of saying things I probably shouldn't - 'let's make a $10,000 bet,' 'I enjoy firing people' and 'I'm not concerned about the very poor.' ""On the other hand, I left the private equity world a long time ago and have since done some pretty cool and impressive things -- like running the Olympics and being the governor of Massachusetts -- but my time in the industry remains important because I saw first-hand the worst of debt-induced risk making (rather than risk taking), how the unfettered market tends toward unsustainably large (and morally reprehensible) extremes of wealth and poverty, how globalization offers us both opportunities and threats, and that the perverse incentives in our winner-take-all financial system can lead individually rational people to make collectively insane decisions. But I also know how markets work and that they have no equal as the core organizing principle for our society. ""So as president I will be ideally positioned to do the obvious things that our country needs to get back on track -- like pass the Buffett Tax, close the carried-interest tax loophole, impose a small tax on corporate transactions with the proceeds used to fund oversight of the financial system and limit the tax-deductibility of acquisition-related debt -- without throwing the capitalist baby out with the bathwater. ""And as a rich businessman, I will have the moral authority to increase taxes on the wealthy in our time of national need while ignoring the shrieks of those who, either out of ignorance or malevolent self-interest, will make baseless claims about the adverse effects on jobs and growth."" Mitt, I appreciate that it's tough in the time of super PACs to say what you really think when there is so much hard-right money for the taking. And I guess you still have the option to Etch A Sketch after the election if you win. But you're our best hope to be a private equity president (Is Henry Kravis running any time soon? Steve Schwarzman? Think about it, you may be our only hope.) and in the last few weeks it has become clear that by pretending to be something that you're not, you run the risk of going down in flames while tarnishing an industry that's been good to you. I know you're a centrist at heart; please come out of the closet! Yours Sincerely, . John .

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- Democrats wasted no time on Tuesday trying to undercut Republicans as they began their convention, attacking a key GOP message before party luminaries took the spotlight in Tampa. Republicans aggressively pushed their convention theme, ""We Built It,"" while Democrats sought to turn it back on Mitt Romney, who was affirmed as the nominee by a roll call of delegates in the first significant moments of the event. Republicans highlighted a remark by President Barack Obama, who said in July that public investment in infrastructure helps businesses grow. ""If you are successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. ... If you've got a business, you didn't build that,"" Obama said at the time. Ryan builds on Obama comment in Roanoke . Republicans have seized on the comment to suggest that Obama is out of touch with small business owners and does not understand how the private sector works. Democrats, however, contend that their rivals are taking things out of context. ""So as Republicans continue to distort the president's words and push their 'We built that' theme in Tampa,"" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said from the ""war room"" Democrats have set up in downtown Tampa near the convention site. ""It's worth asking: What did [Mitt] Romney build?"" Villaraigosa, chair of next week's Democratic convention in Charlotte, answered his own question - ""A bank account in Switzerland, investments in Bermuda and the Caymans, and an inexplicably large IRA. That's what he built."" Democrats are trying to nail Romney with a one-two punch: casting him as wealthy and privileged and saying that his policies would hurt the middle class. ""A stronger, growing middle class means a stronger, growing American economy,"" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said, ""And that's really what this election is all about."" ""On a national scale, Romney economics would spell disaster for America's middle class, would be wrong for America's middle class, would not grow our middle class. And, in fact, would harm our middle class,"" O'Malley added. On Romney's tenure at the top of Boston private equity firm Bain Capital, O'Malley said the Republican's goal when investing in troubled companies was not creating jobs. Instead, O'Malley suggested that the firm under Romney destroyed businesses and jobs in order to generate profit for investors. ""In this economy, there are shipbuilders and there are ship-wreckers,"" O'Malley said. ""There are those who manufacture automobiles and there are those who scrap automobiles. There are those who build up and create things and there are those who make a quick profit by dismantling things."" The Romney campaign quickly fired back. In an email, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams accused Democrats of launching ""false and baseless attacks"" against the former Massachusetts governor whose tenure at the firm prior to his public life made him wealthy. ""The facts speak for themselves,"" Williams said, ""with 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six Americans living in poverty, and median incomes declining, the Obama campaign cannot defend a record of broken promises and failed policies. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a plan to strengthen the middle class by creating jobs and turning around our economy."" Asked at the event about recent polling indicating the public views Romney stronger on handling the economy, Obama senior adviser Robert Gibbs countered. Gibbs pointed to other recent polling data suggesting the public is more partial to Obama on the questions of who cares about people and who cares about the middle class. ""I think those polls demonstrate overwhelmingly that the president is their pick,"" Gibbs said. CNN Poll: Which candidate cares more about you? CNN Poll: Which candidate is better on the issues? The event was the latest salvo in an escalating pace of aggressive campaigning, rhetoric, and attacks on the part of both presidential campaigns. In a break from tradition, the president is out campaigning this week while Republicans hold their nominating convention. Speaking in Iowa Tuesday, Obama said he expects the event to be a ""pretty entertaining show."" Obama renews push with young voters . ""I'm sure they'll, you know, have some wonderful things to say about me,"" he joked. CNN White House Producer Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.","Obama campaign and Democratic National Committee are in Tampa getting their message out .

"(CNN) -- Victoria Pendleton rounded off another night of triumph for hosts Great Britain in the Olympic Velodrome with a storming ride to take gold in the women's keirin Friday. Pendleton suffered bitter disappointment on the first night of finals when she and partner Jess Varnish were disqualified in the women's team sprint for a technical infringement, but made amends with the second gold of her Games career. The 31-year-old Pendleton powered to the front with over a lap to go and held off a determined challenge from China's Guo Shuang to claim an emotional victory. ""My legs were still good from last night. I really wanted to show what I've got. It turned out okay, I guess,"" she said. Lee Wai-Sze of Hong Kong took a surprise bronze with Pendleton's arch-rival Anna Meares of Australia out of the medals. Pendleton will get one more chance for golden glory when she defends her women's sprint title. She followed Britain's men's team pursuit squad on to the track after the quartet of Geraint Thomas, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh had broken their own world record to take gold by beating arch-rivals Australia in the final. Tour de France winner and Olympic time trial champion Bradley Wiggins was in the 6,000 capacity crowd to watch his GB compatriots defend their Beijing crown. Wiggins had been part of that team, which also set a world record, and the 2012 version did not disappoint either. Clancy and Thomas were picking up their second successive golds in the event as they crossed the line in a time of three minutes 51.659 seconds. Australia were just under three seconds adrift with New Zealand winning the bronze medal after beating Russia in their run off. There was promise of more gold for the rampant home team in the women's team pursuit where the trio of Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell and Dani King broke their own world record in qualifying. Their time of three minutes 15.669 seconds, edged their own mark for the 3,000m event set at the world championships earlier this year. It is the seventh world record to be set in the velodrome and the fifth for the hosts, who won the men's team sprint on the first night.","Britain win two gold medals on second night of competition in track cycling .

"New York (CNN) -- Built into the by-laws of most sports Halls of Fame is something called a ""character clause."" It's a loosely-defined metric meant to gauge whether a potential Hall of Famers' off-the-field conduct should prevent an athlete or coach from being honored. The rules use words like integrity, sportsmanship and community to determine whether a sportsman or woman can be inducted into the prestigious club. But once that tribute is bestowed and a Hall of Famer made, can it be rescinded and undone? ""It would be unprecedented,"" said Brad Horn, a spokesman for the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Do sanctions alter Penn State legacy? ""I suppose they could,"" added Rick Leddy of the body that governs the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. That question is now being tossed around about the late Joe Paterno, a college football Hall of Famer since 2007. Officials at the professional basketball, football, baseball and collegiate basketball and football Halls of Fame say it's never happened before. While governing-bodies may use the clause to keep out candidates, once inducted, a Hall of Famer's status is historically safe. But this week's ""unprecedented"" NCAA sanctions against Penn State for its handling of a child sex abuse scandal threaten to shake that very bedrock and raise questions of whether Paterno will be removed from its ranks. ""The question is 'What do you want your Hall (of Fame) to stand for?' "" said Sports Illustrated's Andy Staples, a college football writer. ""Is there a character component to it?"" An internal review found the former head coach could have stopped Jerry Sandusky's sexual attacks against young boys had he done more, and that he may have known more than what he initially told the grand jury. Vestiges of the Paterno legacy, once an enduring symbol of integrity, have since vanished amid the scandal. Within a two-day span this week, his famous bronze statue in front Beaver Stadium was hauled down, as was his record atop major college football's all-time wins list. The NCAA wiped more than a decade's worth of Penn State wins from the record books, slapped the school with a four-year postseason ban and imposed a $60 million sanction after investigators blamed top university leaders, including Paterno, for their ""total and consistent disregard"" of victims while a sexual predator lurked on campus. ""This egregious behavior not only goes against our rules and constitution, but also against our values,"" said Ed Ray, Oregon State president and chairman of the NCAA's executive committee. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno . Paterno's official record moved from 409 wins to 298, dropping to him to 12th on the NCAA college football coaching list, while also vacating six bowl wins and two conference championships. The College Football Hall of Fame board has not indicated its thinking on Paterno in the wake of the scandal or the release of the findings. ""We're very aware of all of this,"" said Steve Hatchell, president and CEO of the National Football Foundation, the Hall's governing body. ""Our group is very methodical,"" he said, when asked if the group was considering Paterno's removal, adding that board members are expected to meet in early October. ""Everything's taken into consideration."" In 2007, the group inducted a still actively coaching Paterno alongside Florida State's Bobby Bowden, amending rules that required a candidate to be retired to qualify. The Hall currently says in his biography, ""No coach has been as synonymous with one school as has Penn State's Joe Paterno."" ""More important than all of the wins and titles he has accumulated may be his legacy with the influence he has had on his players, Penn State Students and alumni,"" it reads. In 1992 and 2006, the foundation awarded him the Distinguished American and the Gold Medal awards. Report: Penn State faced 4-year 'death penalty' Although the board hasn't indicated its thinking, students at Penn State now offer mixed impressions about the prospect of yet another trace of their former coach wiped from the public sphere. ""I don't think they should remove him (from the Hall of Fame),"" said Tierra Brisco, a 21-year-old Penn State senior. ""Well, I don't know,"" she then wavered. ""That's a touchy subject. He built up our school. He was a philanthropist and he did a lot for us. ... But he should have done more."" The issue has again put front and center the question of whether sports figures, often lauded as heroes, should be judged in the annals of sports history by way of their off-the-field conduct. In Major League Baseball, sports writers with the Baseball Writers Association of America vote not only for athletic prowess, but also on a player's ""integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s)."" Banned from baseball amid World Series fixing and gambling scandals, White Sox great ""Shoeless Joe"" Jackson and the league's all-time hits leader Pete Rose are barred from even being considered. Photos: Paterno through the years . But at the National Football League, voters decide based solely on what happened on the field. ""People asked us during the O.J. Simpson trial, that if he were convicted, would he be kicked out?"" said Joe Horrigan, a vice president for communications at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. ""The answer is simple: No."" Players and coaches' behavior outside-the-lines doesn't change what got them inducted, Horrigan explained. In college, the rules are different. While football coaches must boast at least a 60% winning percentage and have coached for a minimum of 10 years and 100 games, candidates must also demonstrate a laudable ""post-football record as a citizen."" ""He must have proven himself worthy as a citizen, carrying the ideals of football forward into his relations with his community and his fellow man with love of his country,"" according National Football Foundation website. Penn State alum: 'We are more than this tragedy' Those standards for years kept out Billy Cannon, a 1959 Heisman Trophy-winner from Louisiana State University, who was nominated in 1983 before his arrest and confession to a $6 million counterfeiting scheme. The scandal rocked LSU and prompted the foundation to rescind his membership bid before induction. But a quarter of a century later, the former running back-turned dentist was offered a second chance and formally inducted in 2008. Others like ex-New York Giants star Lawrence Taylor, a Chapel Hill stand-out who last year pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct, have not gained entry to the club despite appearing on the ballot. Meanwhile, Sandusky -- a former assistant coach who continues to maintain his innocence -- awaits sentencing for sexually abusing minors over a 15-year period. Some of the abuse occurred in the same campus building where Paterno worked, according to the findings of former FBI Director Louis Freeh and his team of investigators. The Freeh report drew criticism for its lack of access to critical witnesses, including Paterno, who died in January. His family also reminded the public that ""Paterno has never had a hearing,"" and that tearing down his statute would ""not serve the victims of Jerry Sandusky's horrible crimes or help heal the Penn State Community."" Photos: Final tributes, Paterno statue removed . But the report -- albeit limited in scope -- shed new light on the scandal and raised questions about whether Paterno's marred legacy will affect his spot among gridiron greats. Nicknamed ""JoePa,"" fans adored him for a storied coaching career that brought Penn State football to national prominence. But the university's board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011 following a 46-year career because his ""decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership."" Paterno reported to his superiors a child sex abuse incident in a university shower that involved Sandusky in 2001, but did not inform police. His ouster prompted student riots, overturning a news van and clashing with police, who used tear gas to break up throngs of angry protesters. Since then, material reminders of that legacy have faded. At State College, the name of a popular football camp-out is now called ""Nittanyville,"" rather than ""Paternoville,"" and a famous local mural no longer shows a halo painted above the image of the school's former head coach. But it's unclear whether Paterno's place in the Hall of Fame will go the way of his famed 900-pound bronze statute removed from the university earlier this week, a structure that once exuded a sense of permanence that greeted fans at Penn State.

"(CNN) -- There will be a new women's champion crowned at the French Open this weekend, but at least one of the semifinalists has prior experience of playing in the title match at Roland Garros. Sam Stosur missed out on her first grand slam title in 2010, losing to Francesca Schiavone in the final, and also reached the last four the previous year. If the Australian can continue that progression in Paris, she will have a second major championship to add to her 2011 U.S. Open triumph. Standing in her way is Schiavone's compatriot Sara Errani, who is seeking to give Italy a place in the final for the third successive year. The 21st seed has never beaten world No. 6 Stosur in their five meetings so far, winning just one set, but the 25-year-old has claimed three clay titles this year. She reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in January, when Stosur crumbled under the weight of home expectation after her New York success and fell at the first hurdle. Stosur sealed her semifinal place on Tuesday with a 6-4 6-1 demolition of Slovakian 15th seed Dominika Cibulkova, who knocked out world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the fourth round. Errani followed up her victories over former French Open champions Ana Ivanovic and Svetlana Kuznetsova by ending the hopes of German 10th seed Angelique Kerber, winning 6-3 7-6 (7-2). ""I don't have the power of the big girls so I have to use speed, resistance and use my head because it can be difficult for me some times when an opponent is stronger,"" Errani said after beating a top-10 player for the first time in 29 attempts. ""I worked hard all winter, but I also changed my racket which made me feel better on the court."" Stosur, one of the most powerful players on the tour, was delighted after beating the smallest in Cibulkova, who stands just five foot three inches. ""It's never easy to come out here, with it windy and playing an opponent who was going for it. She runs very fast and has quick legs,"" said the 28-year-old, hoping to become the first Australian woman to win the tournament since Margaret Court in 1973. ""The last few years have been good for me in Paris. It doesn't get any better than this."" The other two quarterfinals will be played on Wednesday, when Maria Sharapova faces Kaia Kanepi of Estonia and Czech fourth seed Petra Kvitova takes on Kazakh qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova. World No. 2 Sharapova is seeking to complete her collection of grand slam titles, and the Russian will move above Azarenka in the rankings if she reaches the final.","World No. 6 Sam Stosur reaches French Open semifinals for third time in four years .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- One of the biggest-name dance DJs in the world, Paul van Dyk is in demand at clubs and festivals from Las Vegas to Ibiza. Paul van Dyk witnessed the birth of electronic music ""as a sub-culture"" in his hometown of Berlin. Twice voted the world's top DJ, van Dyk has also earned a reputation as a freethinker and social activist, working for children's charities and speaking out against drug use in dance culture. His years on the road have not dented the 37-year-old Berliner's enthusiasm for his hometown. He talks to My City, My Life about the city where he cut his teeth on the dance scene and where he still lives. CNN: What is it you like about Berlin? Paul van Dyk: It is a very open city; it's very open-minded, cosmopolitan. There are a lot of people from all over the world coming to this place and bringing something to the place and this is something very special. Something that I really appreciate, especially since I knew Berlin from a time when it wasn't that way, this is something I like a lot. CNN: Do you think the way the city was divided in the past has made it more united today? Paul van Dyk: I don't think it is more united; there is still a distinctive difference between the west and east, not just in terms of architecture or the structure of the city. Also the mentality of the people somehow -- I believe a lot of East Berliners still feel like East Berliners, and West Berliners likewise. After such a long time, I think it's still an issue. CNN: How would you explain these differences? Paul van Dyk: It's very difficult because I think if I was trying to describe it, it would be very unfair on a lot of people because not all East Germans are alike, nor are all West Germans the same. There are certain issues that seem to group up. I'm an East German in West Germany, living quite an international life. CNN: Describe the attitude of the typical Berliner? Paul van Dyk: Berlin provides the freedom to live your individual lifestyle and do what you want. At the same time there is kind of a unity to it. You know, the Berliners kind of stick together and that's something very special and something you'll probably only experience in Berlin. There's a kind of cute toughness to it -- you don't get angry about it. CNN: As an artist, what inspires you about the city? Paul van Dyk: I'm definitely inspired by the dirty basement, clubbing atmosphere. This is where I grew up; where the clubs were and where the music happened. I think Berlin is a city where electronic music started as a sub-culture, as something against the established culture and there's still some sort of punk in it. That's still in my music and always will be, no matter what I do. CNN: What do you think is the predominant culture of Berlin? Paul van Dyk: I think Berlin has a coffee shop/bar culture. When I say bar, it's not necessarily the posh sort of thing, it's more the place where people meet and hang out after work or before they go clubbing, and that is quite established. There are few clubs in the world that became cathedrals of electronic music: Chicago in Chicago; Gatecrasher in Sheffield (in northern England); Tyler in New York. Ewok was the place in Berlin for electronic music; this was one of my first residencies in Berlin. It was just a big black warehouse with a loud PA and great music and great people. CNN: What inspired you to become a musician? Paul van Dyk: The reason I started to DJ was because I was so bored with the music in the clubs in Berlin -- it was really one-dimensional. My musical education came from listening to the radio so I knew there was so much more in the whole wide world of electronic music to be discovered. So I went to record stores, I bought some records and made some tapes for myself and friends. One of my friends passed my tape on to a promoter and that's how I got my first gig. So that's when I knew, this is what I wanted to do. CNN: Was there a point that you thought, ''now I've made it'? Paul van Dyk: I think your career ends when you start thinking 'I've made it.' I never really felt there was a moment where suddenly I thought, 'wow, this is really happening.' My first gig was very special to me because that's when I realized that this is what I really wanted to do. But every single gig is still a challenge; I still put all my efforts into it. CNN: Is there something different about playing to a home crowd? Paul van Dyk: It's always more challenging (laughs). No, to me it's always very special because a lot of my friends are here and we always do our own events in Berlin so there's always a little more involvement than just going there and playing. CNN: What makes Berlin home to you? Paul van Dyk: I love Berlin because I know my way around, which is something that's important to me. The other thing is that it's a city that provides a lot of chill-out space in a way; you know, places where you can just go and relax, especially when you have a hectic schedule like mine. CNN: Where do you like to go to relax? Paul van Dyk: Well, Berlin has a lot of parks; I think it is one of the greenest cities in the world. Personally for me, the stables, the horse riding thing where I can relax a little and chill out. Where I live I can run with my dogs from one park to the next park to the next. CNN: If the city was a person what would they be like? Paul van Dyk: Miserable but happy, poor but rich in thought -- and very twisted (laughs).","Paul van Dyk says his hometown of Berlin is open-minded and cosmopolitan .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, nine athletes were tested positive for ""sophisticated doping"" and banned from the 2012 Olympics. This shouldn't surprise anyone. For as long as there have been games, there have been stories of cheating. Competitive sports -- an open-ended contest for a prize -- started in antiquity. The Olympics, which were held every four years at Olympia, a sanctuary to the god Zeus in the western Peloponnese, became the most prestigious venue for athletics by about 600 B.C. and spawned a whole series of similar events in the next century. Opening ceremony reaction: Pomp, patriotism and political gaffes . Managing the Olympics or any other athletic event was never easy. In the first surviving set of rules at Olympia, breaking your opponent's fingers in wrestling was strictly forbidden. Rules like this point to a main worry among the people who ran games in the ancient world -- ""performance suppression."" While there were no ancient rules against performance enhancement -- our chief concern today -- there is lot of evidence for both the theory and practice of getting people to do less than their best. Some forms of performance suppression were more effective than others. The most colorful was to place a curse on an athlete so he would not do his best (or the gods of the underworld would drive him mad). This often involved the burial of a lead tablet containing the curse in some place that mattered -- ancient racing venues have produced a fair number of these items. Another method, typical in the ancient and modern worlds, involved hidden payments to athletes to take a dive. In one famous case, the man who promised a bribe to his son's opponent refused to pay because he decided that his boy would have won anyway -- and was stupid enough to say so where people could hear him. Perhaps there is not a lot here that has changed, as a British paper is reporting that the father of the only woman on Australia's archery team has had a restraining order lifted because he convinced a judge that he had not tried to intimidate one of his daughter's rivals in a qualifying round. There there's the route of buying an official, a scheme well known up to this day. It's an athletic nightmare that entails a series of dead heats being declared until the favored contestant could win. Sometimes the open prejudice of management would come into play. One easy way to get to the desired result was to arrange an especially easy draw for the favored athlete so he could reach the final round against an exhausted opponent. This seems to have been so common that one man actually boasted that he had never won through the Roman emperor's favor. Finally, and most unpleasantly, there was simple dirty play. Some people developed especially violent moves and were not deterred by the cautionary tale about a man who killed his opponent with a vicious blow in a championship fight and lost the title because people thought he was ghastly. Chariot racing, which was extremely popular in the old days, seems also to have been prone to catastrophes of all sorts as drivers smashed into each other on the long, crowded course. In one Olympic year, things were so bad that not a single chariot finished the race. Athletes would use a reputation for ferociousness to intimidate their opponents. Opinion: Team USA's militaristic uniform a problem? Responses to cheating have always involved stripping a champion of a title, and, at least at Olympia, included the requirement that the athlete dedicate a monument recording his shame for all time (it is thanks to these monuments that we can appreciate the range of cheating). This method of embarrassing the cheater, which stressed the memory of what a person had done wrong, seems a bit more effective than the modern practice of merely erasing a name from the record book and trying to forget what happened. In the next few weeks, as we watch the best athletes from around the world setting new records, don't be surprised if more stories of cheating emerge. And if we want to reduce cheating in competitive sporting events, maybe it's better to follow the ancient practice of remembering athletes' misdeeds by, say, erecting a public monument that contains all the names of the Olympic cheaters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Potter.","Nine athletes tested positive for doping and banned from the 2012 Olympics .

"(CNN) -- While Rafael Nadal climbed into the crowd to hug his friends and family after clinching a record seventh French Open title on Monday, Novak Djokovic sat disconsolate at the side of the court. The world No. 1's bid to become the first man since 1969 to hold all four grand slams had come to a disappointing end -- with a double-fault. One of the most anticipated finals in recent tennis history was largely sabotaged by wet weather, which meant the match was held over from Sunday for only the second time. Second-ranked Nadal had been quickest out of the blocks after the resumption of play, breaking Djokovic's serve immediately, and even another downpour could not stop the Spaniard sealing a 6-4 6-3 2-6 7-5 victory as he won six of the nine games played. It took the 26-year-old past Bjorn Borg's mark of six successes at the clay-court major and extended his winning record at the tournament to 52-1. He has now joined the legendary Swede on 11 grand slam titles overall, along with Australian Rod Laver -- who was the last man to hold all four major titles at one time. They trail another Australian, Roy Emerson, on 12, American Pete Sampras on 14 and Roger Federer -- beaten by Djokovic in Friday's semifinals -- on 16. ""It's an honor but the most important thing is this tournament. It's unforgettable, one of the most special moments in my career,"" Nadal said. ""It was a privilege to play against one of the best players in the world."" Djokovic, who lost in the semifinals last year, was left on five grand slams. He has won the Australian Open three times, including a record-breaking near six-hour final against Nadal in January, plus last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open tournaments. ""I feel really privileged to be in this position, being in the final at Roland Garros for the first time,"" the 25-year-old said. ""The playing conditions were not good. But it's not anybody's fault, and it's not the reason why I lost today. ""He is definitely the best player in history on this surface, and results are showing that he is one of the best players that ever played this game, and he is only 26 years old. Hopefully we can have many more battles."" The tennis season now moves onto grass ahead of the next grand slam, Wimbledon, which starts in London on June 25. The Olympic tournament will also be held in the British capital.","Rafael Nadal moves past Bjorn Borg with record seventh Paris crown .

"(CNN) -- When I first heard about the shooting rampage in a Colorado theater, I was shocked and horrified. It was like reliving the Virginia Tech shooting all over again. News: Remembering the Colorado shooting victims . On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech experienced the largest mass shooting on a college campus, with 32 students killed and 17 wounded. Our typical serene spring morning was bombarded with continuous screeching of rescue and police sirens alerting everyone that a terrible situation was at hand. As news spread, our community responded swiftly, but with a sense of bewilderment, grief and anger. There was no doubt that this was a life changing experience for the survivors as well as families of the victims. Timeline: Worst mass shootings in U.S. The campus disaster response network immediately sprung into action to assist families directly affected by the shooting. The day after the incident, a network of professionals met to begin the task of planning an ongoing mental health response to the tragedy. This group included university personnel, counselors, clinical psychologists, community agencies and the local mental health association. On the day after the attack, a candlelight vigil was held for the entire university. It was quite moving to observe the thousands of candles burning, signifying the great loss. That night, 6-foot walls of plywood and paper provided the opportunity to record Bible verses, sentiments and vows to remember those who died. This proved quite cathartic. A website, Hokie United, encouraged people to bring mementos to the drill field as an expression of love and support. Convocation took place in Cassell Coliseum and Lane Stadium. This event was well attended by about 35,000 students, faculty and staff. The service was a major step in communal healing. The attendance of President George W. Bush, first lady Laura Bush and Gov. Tim Kaine was an important source of support. The resolve to engender hope was eloquently voiced by the final words of professor and poet Nikki Giovanni, ""...We are the Hokies, We will prevail, We will prevail, We will prevail ....We are Virginia Tech."" By all indications, it appears that Aurora, Colorado, engaged in many similar steps to meet the immediate demands of the traumatized victims. The SWAT team, police and rescue personnel reacted quickly. It appears that the clergy, mental health professionals and the Red Cross were all responsive in timely and meaningful ways. As the days pass, people in the community have been offering condolences to the families with flowers, candles and mementos. News: Colorado shooting: Stories of survival . The memorial service demonstrates the community's show of genuine care. President Obama meeting with the families as a group and as individuals was a powerful acknowledgment of their pain and hopefully served as a tremendous sign that the nation stands behind them. Perhaps the most unfortunate consequences of both the Virginia Tech and Aurora tragedies is that the families of the deceased, the injured and others most exposed to the shooting (including first responders) often do not seek help. The stigma associated with mental health interventions prevents individuals from obtaining much needed assistance. It is too frequently the case that individuals wait for years to take advantage of the effective mental health treatments targeting traumatic experiences. Months and years of pain, anxiety, confusion as well as loss of relationships and lack of effectiveness in the classroom or workplace is tolerated until ""breaking points"" are reached. Those affected by the shooting should not be afraid to ask for help; they should not wait and suffer silently and alone. News: How to help the victims . It is my hope that the resilience and communal strength displayed by the Hokie Nation in the days, months and years after the Virginia Tech shooting will serve as a model for everyone affected in that Aurora movie theater. The adage ""out of darkness comes light"" is a reminder for those who endure tragedy that there is always hope. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russell T. Jones.","Russell Jones: Hearing about the Aurora shooting was like reliving the Virginia Tech shooting .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Novak Djokovic battled back from the brink of defeat at the French Open on Tuesday to rescue his hopes of becoming the first man in 43 years to hold all four grand slam titles. The Serbian saved four match-points before finally overcoming home favorite Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals. Djokovic, who has never reached the final at Roland Garros, triumphed 6-1 5-7 5-7 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 against the fifth seed in a scintillating match lasting just over four hours. The 25-year-old set up a rematch with 16-time grand slam champion Roger Federer, who beat Djokovic in the Paris semifinals last year to end his 43-match winning run. ""He was the better player for most of the match and I was fortunate to come back from four match-points down. It was an incredible match,"" said Djokovic, who won the first and fifth sets in a combined time of just 53 minutes. The hopes of a nation had rested on Tsonga, playing in the quarterfinals of his home event for the first time, but France's wait for a first male champion since Yannick Noah in 1983 must continue. Instead, Djokovic will have a day's rest before continuing his bid to match Australia's Rod Laver, who twice won all four grand slams in a calendar year -- as an amateur in 1962 and then as a professional at the start of the Open era in 1969. ""I did what I said I would and gave everything. I came close and I would have loved to have won,"" said Tsonga, who had vowed before the match to ""fight like a lion."" ""It's a shame because I was pretty close, but at the end I had no energy left. Now I will have to close this chapter,"" the 27-year-old added. Federer reached the last four at a major for a record-equaling 31st time as he came from two sets down to end the hopes of injury-hampered Juan Martin Del Potro. The Swiss third seed won 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-0 6-3 in a virtual repeat of their 2009 semifinal, when Federer went on to claim the Roland Garros crown for the first and only time in his illustrious career. Del Potro avenged that defeat by beating Federer in the 2009 U.S. Open final for his only major success, but this time the Argentine ninth seed could not maintain his ferocious opening momentum. ""I knew Juan Martin's knee was bothering him and was trying to finish the rallies quickly,"" Federer said. ""I knew it would be a big fight today."" The other two quarterfinals will be played on Wednesday, when world No. 2 Rafael Nadal continues his bid for a record seventh title as he takes on fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro, the 12th seed. Britain's world No. 4 Andy Murray faces a big test of his hopes of winning his first grand slam as he lines up against sixth seed David Ferrer, who has won all of their three clay clashes.","Novak Djokovic saves four match-points to reach French Open semifinals .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal remains on course for a record seventh French Open title after he dismissed the challenge of fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro to notch up his 50th Roland Garros victory. The world No.2 triumphed 7-6 6-2 6-3 over the 12th seed as he goes in search of the 11th grand slam title in his illustrious career. Standing between Nadal and a seventh Paris final is another Spaniard, David Ferrer, after the No. 6 seed beat Britain's Andy Murray 6-4 6-7 6-3 6-2. The former world No. 1 has lost only once at the French Open since making his debut as an 18-year-old in 2005. He is yet to lose a set in this year's tournament. ""It was a tough one, but I am through and I am very happy,"" Nadal told the ATP Tour's official website. ""You cannot expect to win an easy match in the quarterfinals of a grand slam. On his semi-final against Ferrer, Nadal added: ""We played each other a lot of times. His game bothers everybody because he's one of the best players in the world on every surface -- on clay especially. ""He's a complete player. It's very difficult to play against him, because his movement is probably the best in the world and he's able to hit the ball very early a lot of the time."" Should Nadal secure his seventh title he will go one better than legendary Swede Bjorn Borg, who has six. He will also match Bjorg's record of 11 career grand slam titles. Murray, who said he was satisfied with his performance in the tournament despite going out to a player seeded two places below him, said Nadal is the favorite to win. He told reporters: ""I think the four best clay court players in the world are left in and whoever plays best will win. Probably have to favor Rafa slightly, but everyone is playing very, very well."" Ferrer's victory ensured he made the final four of the French Open for the first time in his career, a surprise statistic for someone who is renowned as a clay court specialist. He said his four-set win over Murray was grueling, but good preparation for his showdown with Nadal, who he labeled the best player on clay ever. ""Tonight's match was very hard, physically very difficult,"" he said. ""But I am happy to be in the semifinals at Roland Garros for the first time. ""It will be a tough match against Rafa, he's the best in history on this surface, but I hope to have a good match."" Murray's disappointment was evident on court, as he made 59 unforced errors during the match and seemed to be troubled by a series of injuries. ""He had his chances and converted them,"" he said of Ferrer. ""He's solid and consistent and if you don't convert opportunities against him, the games become longer and the pressure builds on you. ""But it was a good tournament for me. I felt better coming in this year than I did last year. I lost to a better clay court player tonight. There are things to work on but I knew it would be a tough match.""

"(CNN) -- Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak gave the Montreal crowd something to shout about by sealing a quarter-final place in the Rogers Cup tournament. It was the first time in two decades that a native had got so far in the tournament and it sets up a commentator's nightmare as she takes on similar-sounding Caroline Wozniacki, the former world No.1. Wozniak overcame American Christina McHale in straight sets 7-6 6-3 in her third round encounter on Saturday after rain prevented her from finishing the job on Friday night. Meanwhile, Wozniacki overcame a problem with her right leg to beat American Varvara Lepchenko 4-6 6-3 6-4. At one stage, Wozniacki received treatment on court for the injury, but it didn't stop the Danish player completing the task. It was a simple win for tournament second seed Agnieszka Radwanska, who secured a 6-2 6-4 win over Chanelle Scheepers, who has not won against top 20 seeds in the past 24 encounters. Frenchman Richard Gasquet booked his place in only his second senior final by beating the service game of American John Isner. The bronze-winning Olympian posted a 7-6 6-3 victory win Saturday.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova stands on the brink of tennis history after romping into her first French Open final on Thursday. The second seed's straight-sets win over Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova not only ensured she will reclaim the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in four years, but also gave her the chance to become just the 10th female player to complete a career grand slam. Standing in the Russian's way of emulating the likes of greats such as Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert and Serena Williams is the 2012 tournament's surprise package, Sara Errani. Ranked 23rd in the world, Errani continued her dream run by beating 2010 Roland Garros runner-up and reigning U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur in Thursday's opening semifinal. It means Italy will be represented for the third year in a row, after Francesca Schiavone lifted her first and only grand slam title on the Paris clay in 2010 and then lost to Li Na 12 months ago. Sharapova reached Saturday's title match with a ruthless 6-3 6-3 win over Czech fourth seed Kvitova, going some way to erasing memories of her defeat in last year's Wimbledon final. The 25-year-old last won a grand slam title at the 2008 Australian Open, before serious shoulder injuries forced her into a long rehab. She made the Paris semis for the second time last year, and has already reached one major final this year. Defeat to Victoria Azarenka in Melbourne in January cost her the No. 1 ranking, but on Monday she will rise above the Belorussian no matter what happens in her first career clash with Errani. ""It's an amazing feeling to be in my first final. I have been in two semifinals but it was always my dream of getting to the final stage,"" said Sharapova, who won Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004 and then the U.S. Open in 2006. ""That's pretty special. After my shoulder surgery, my ranking was out of the top 100, but I thought if I could be number one in the world before that then I could do it again."" Errani had lost all five previous meetings with Stosur, but she continued the form that saw her beat world No. 10 Angelique Kerber and former French Open champions Svetlana Kuznetsova and Ana Ivanovic in earlier rounds. ""I didn't think I could do this coming into the tournament. Never. This is just incredible for me,"" said Errani, who will become only the third woman from Italy to ever rank in the top 10 after Schiavone and Flavia Pennetta. ""The first round here was difficult, this match was difficult, all the matches have been difficult, and I'm very happy how I've played. ""The most important thing for me is I'm just thinking about playing -- I'm just playing my game without thinking of what I'm doing. But I'm not finished."" Sixth seed Stosur had been seeking to become the first Australian woman since Margaret Court in 1973 to win the tournament. Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza won their second grand slam mixed doubles title together after beating Mexico's Santiago Gonzalez and Poland's Klaudia Jans-Ignacik 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in the final. The Indian duo also won the Australian Open in 2009, while the 38-year-old Bhupathi is one of the most successful doubles players ever with 12 titles overall.","Maria Sharapova beats Petra Kvitova to reach French Open final for first time .

"(CNN) -- Relatives of some those who died in the Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting last month accuse the charity raising money for their benefit of ignoring their demands to help decide how to spend it. ""We need people who were in the theater, together with those who have lost loved ones, driving these decisions,"" said Tom Teves, father of shooting victim Alex Teves. A spokesman for the Colorado governor promised the families' concerns would be addressed soon. At least $5 million has been donated to the Aurora Victims Relief Fund since it was established with the approval of Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to help families of the 12 killed and 58 wounded. The governor chose the Community First Foundation to oversee the relief fund. Prosecutors: Theater shooting suspect told classmate he wanted to kill people . Teves led a group he said represented 11 of the 12 people who died in the July 20 mass shooting in a news conference in Denver Tuesday afternoon. ""We're certain that everyone who donated their hard-earned wages intended for 100% of the donations to go directly to the victims and then each family affected would use those funds for what they most needed to help their healing process,"" Teves told reporters. ""Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case."" The only disbursements have been to 10 local nonprofit groups, including the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, also known as COVA, he said. ""When you generate funds for a relief fund called the Aurora Victims Relief Fund, using pictures and names of our murdered loved ones without our permission, it would stand to reason that the fund is for the victims of the Aurora shooting,"" he said. COVA sent checks for $5,000 to each of the 70 victims' families last week, but Chantel Blunk, whose husband Jonathan Blunk was among the dead, said the money is not enough to help her deal with the trauma to her son and daughter, ages 2 and 4. When she asked COVA to buy a plane ticket for her daughter Haley to travel from Reno, Nevada, to Denver, ""They told me 'No,'"" Blunk said. ""They're like 'There's no more funding and we can't help you."" Judge orders key records sealed, other released . Haley has been suffering nightmares and the trip to where her father died might help her find ""closure,"" Blunk said. ""Begging COVA, they just told me 'No,'"" she said. ""She didn't say sorry or anything."" COVA did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The families demand ""a robust voice"" on the committee that decides where the money goes, Teves said. Cheryl Haggstrom, Community First Foundation executive vice president, said there has been ""conversation"" about adding family representatives to the committee. Teves called on the governor to intervene, suggesting he has ignored their pleas for help. ""You came and grieved with our families,"" Teves said. ""We allowed you into our inner-most circle at the worst time in our lives, we didn't do this lightly. You pledged 12 times 'We will remember.' Are you a man who is true to his words or are they just words?"" Hickenlooper's spokesman, Eric Brown, told CNN Tuesday afternoon that his office is working to ""improve communication and the ongoing distribution of assistance."" ""Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation,"" Brown said. ""We understand the frustration shared today by victims' families. That's why we have been advocating for them to have a greater voice in the process. Family representatives will meet with the relief funds committee on Friday, Brown said. ""Families have received money and other services through the great generosity of others, "" Brown said. ""They will receive more."" When Hickenlooper's office announced the fund last month, he promised the money would ""help those impacted by this tragedy begin to recover and rebuild their lives."" Initial donors included Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, co-producers of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which was playing in the movie theater when the shooting began. Sources at Warner Bros. studios, a subsidiary of CNN's parent company Time Warner, told CNN that the company made a ""substantial"" donation. Warner Bros., a subsidiary of CNN's parent company Time Warner, would not divulge how much money it was giving out of what the sources said was respect for the victims. The Community First Foundation website said that contributions would go toward meeting the needs of the shooting victims and their families, ""and, as funds are available, the broad needs of those affected in the community.""

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has beaten Juan Martin Del Potro 6-3 6-2 in Saturday's Cincinnati Masters semi final to continue his fine run of form in the build up to the U.S. Open. The semi final in Ohio represented a rematch of the bronze medal match at the London Olympics, which Del Potro won. The Serbian will face world number one Roger Federer in the final after he ran out 7-6 6-3 over his fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka. Djokovic, who has lost in the final at Cincinnati three times before, always looked comfortable against Del Potro, with the Serbian showing the form that helped him win the U.S. Open in 2011. ""I mean, the last two matches have been really, really good, maybe the best two hard court matches I've played in last two weeks,"" Djokovic told the tournament website. ""It's a great stage I am in at this moment, playing another final of Cincinnati, too. So I'm very much looking forward to trying to get the title."" The Cincinnati crown is one of only three Masters crown the former world number one has yet to win. Del Potro had several opportunities to take the lead, but struggled to make the most of his chances. ""I had I think six break point in the match and I didn't take one. Against Novak, or the top players, if you don't take your opportunities, you will lose for sure,"" the Argentine star told the official website. The 2009 U.S. Open winner, Del Potro was struggling with a wrist injury throughout the match, having to take pain killers at the end of the first set. ""I have experience in wrist problems, and I would like to take time to fix this little problem,"" he said. Federer goes into Sunday's final after a solid week in Cincinnati. He was pushed all the way by Wawrinka in the first set, but managed to show some of the form that took him back to the top of the rankings in the second and record a comfortable win.","Novak Djokovic topples Juan Martin Del Potro in first semi final .

"(CNN) -- When Venus Williams was knocked off the top of the women's tennis world rankings by younger sister Serena in July 2002, she couldn't have imagined that over a decade later she would still be waiting for a return to the summit. Despite winning three further Wimbledon singles titles since last being No. 1, the American has endured a 10-year spell blighted by losses of form and fitness -- culminating in being diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome at last year's U.S. Open. But the 32-year-old is on the comeback trail, setting her sights on a return to the top of the world -- plus singles and doubles glory at Flushing Meadows -- after Thursday's third-round win over French Open runner-up Sara Errani at the Cincinnati Masters. Serena Williams battles 'super crazy hair' ""Before all my injuries and illnesses I was No. 2 in the world and Serena was No. 1, and we were No. 1 in doubles,"" the seven-time grand slam winner, now ranked 64th, told reporters. ""We were literally on top of the world until a lot of things came crashing down on us. I'd like to work my way back. Of course that's a dream for me. ""I dream of those things. That's why I'm here, because I feel like I still have it. It's one match at a time, pretty much."" Williams' reward is a quarterfinal match against third seed Sam Stosur, the Australian who beat Serena in an ill-tempered 2011 U.S. Open final to claim her first grand slam title. While Venus is trying to recapture her best form, younger sister Serena is the dominant force in women's tennis. The world No. 4 won a fifth Wimbledon title last month before returning to Centre Court to destroy Maria Sharapova in the Olympic women's singles final at London 2012. The 14-time major winner continued her imperious run of form by battling past a stubborn Urszula Radwanska 6-4 6-3. After the match, Serena spoke of fondness for the Pole, whose older sister Agnieszka is top seed for the hard-court tournament and reached the last eight with a three-set win over American teenager Sloane Stephens. ""I think they're both great players, and great sisters,"" the 30-year-old said as she continued her quest for a first Cincinnati title. ""I absolutely love seeing another pair of sisters doing so well on the tour. ""Urszula has worked really hard, and me being a younger sister and Urszula being a younger sister too, I'm always looking for her to do well and I hope she does really well. ""Her game is great. What's best about her game is she's like her sister -- she doesn't do anything badly. Those are always tough opponents to play."" Serena's next opponent is German fifth seed Angelique Kerber, who advanced courtesy of a 6-4 7-6 (7-5) defeat of Czech qualifier Andrea Hlavackova. Also safely through is 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. After picking up her first title of 2012 in Montreal on Monday, the world No. 5 continued her winning run by beating China's Peng Shuai 6-2 6-2.","Venus Williams sets sights on No. 1 ranking for the first time in 10 years .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world watched, as the London 2012 Olympic Games opened with director Danny Boyle's elaborate ode to England, and furiously tapped their reaction on social media. But one comment on Twitter has sparked a political fracas on the home soil of the games, as a British member of Parliament lamented the ""multi-cultural crap"" of the £27 million ($42.4 million) ceremony. Entitled ""Isle of Wonder,"" Boyle -- the Oscar-winning director best known for hit movies ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" -- put together a star-studded on-field dramatization that drew on Shakespeare and Brit Pop to chart Britain from its pastoral roots through the Industrial Revolution to James Bond, Harry Potter and the Beatles. ""The most leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen -- more than Beijing, the capital of a communist state! Welfare tribute next?"" wrote Aidan Burley, a Conservative Party MP who was fired as a ministerial aide in David Cameron's government after revelations he attended a Nazi-themed stag party in France last year. ""Thank God the athletes have arrived! Now we can move on from leftie multi-cultural crap. Bring back red arrows, Shakespeare and the Stones!"" he added minutes later. Burley backpedaled after the strong online backlash against his comments, posting: ""Seems my tweet has been misunderstood. I was talking about the way it was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself."" Queen opens the London 2012 Olympics . There was a great deal of comparison being drawn between the London ceremony and the 2008 Beijing Olympics. @legallyblondekf wrote: ""Ha! London sees your zillion drummers drumming in unison and raises you a deaf drummer. Your move China,"" referring to deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie leading drummers during the London ceremony. Like London, a pre-eminent director -- Zhang Yimou, director of films such as the 1991 film ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and more recently ""The Flowers of War,"" starring Christian Bale -- choreographed the Beijing ceremony. ""(London's) opening ceremony was a far cry from Beijing's. Even the director of the London Olympics ceremony complained of the budget being too small, having only 27 million pounds,"" user Haluo-yuan wrote on Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blogging site in China, where state censors block Twitter. ""There's no comparison with the formidable China."" China's best Olympic hopes in London . Still, commentators on Sina Weibo were largely complimentary of the London ceremony -- although many complained about getting up at 4 a.m. in China to watch the event live. ""London's Olympic opening ceremony certainly was interesting, but it can't be said that it was superior to Beijing's. It can only be said that each had its merits,"" wrote Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University with 3 million followers on Sina Weibo. ""Beijing's Olympics and its immense grandeur were hosted by a developing country, by a country that had never hosted the Olympics before,"" he added. ""Now, we can relax but must also understand to strive for new heights of dignity. There's no need for contentious feeling. Each has its own beauty."" Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and activist, helped design the iconic Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics before he fell afoul with authorities and is now under house arrest on tax evasion charges. He wrote Saturday: ""The London opening ceremony is free, relaxed and touching, smoothly switching between different time and space, expressing confidence. It's the festival of modern citizens."" Athletes themselves were posting from inside the London arena, such as LeBron James, the three-time NBA MVP who is playing for the U.S. basketball team. James was up late into the night feeding images to Instagram from his view of the ceremony inside the stadium. ""Me with one of the best the game of basketball has to offer,"" he wrote, tweeting a photo alongside U.S. teammate Kobe Bryant. Decoded: Boyle's Olympic spectacular . Indeed, the real-time social media scrum seemed to take some of the fun out of the ceremony for viewers in the U.S., where the broadcast on NBC was tape-delayed to run during prime time hours.

"(CNN) -- Top seed Maria Sharapova survived a scare against Tsvetana Pironkova before securing her place in round three at Wimbledon. Sharapova, whose first Grand Slam victory came at Wimbledon eight years ago, resumed at 7-6 3-1 after bad light had halted her progress on Wednesday. But Bulgarian Pironkova quickly broke back and went on to level the match in a second-set tie break. That was a wake-up call for the French Open champion, though, as Russian number one seed Sharapova took the deciding set 6-0. ""I started with no motor whatsoever. I was just on pause but I guess it's more important how you finish,"" Sharapova said. Four-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams breezed through as she dismissed Melinda Czink 6-1 6-4 in less than an hour. And it was a similarly comfortable passage for second seed Victoria Azarenka, as last year's semi-finalst eased through with a 6-2 6-0 win over Swiss Romina Oprandi. There was a surprise defeat for 2007 finalist and ninth seed Marion Bartoli, who was beaten 6-4 6-3 by Croatia's Mirjana Lucic. Eight seed Angelique Kerber beat Ekaterina Makarova 7-5 6-3 and will face Christina McHale in round three after the 28th seed beat Mathilde Johansson 7-5 7-5.

"(CNN) -- Li Na's French Open title defense came to a shock end on Monday as the Chinese tennis star followed world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in exiting the clay-court grand slam. With second-ranked Maria Sharapova struggling into the quarterfinals with a labored victory, the way is open for the lesser lights of the women's game to make a name for themselves. Li had been hoping to become the first player since Justine Henin in 2007 to successfully defend her title, but the world No. 7 lost 3-6 6-2 6-0 to Kazakh qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova -- ranked 135 places below her. ""I lost one match so don't try to put me down,"" she said angrily at the post-match press conference. ""I will try to find the reason why I lost. I will take some days off to totally forget tennis, then try to come back next week. I need some time to recover, I'm not a machine."" Sharapova also battled with the cold, windy conditions at Roland Garros as her serve fell apart and she made a series of unforced errors before finally beating unseeded Czech Klara Zakopalova 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 6-2. The Russian is seeking to win the tournament for the first time, having reached the semifinals last year and in 2007, and she will displace Azarenka at the top of the rankings if she makes it to the title match. She has not won a grand slam since 2008, when she added the Australian Open to her U.S. Open and Wimbledon crowns. The 25-year-old has resurrected her career after longterm shoulder problems, but major doubts remain about the consistency and strength of her serve -- which let her down in last year's Wimbledon final defeat by Petra Kvitova and again in the title match against Azarenka in Melbourne in January. The match with Zakopalova featured an incredible 21 breaks of service as Sharapova delivered 12 double-faults to her opponent's seven and 53 unforced errors to the 30-year-old's 48. ""The conditions were difficult today, but it was a good test,"" said Sharapova, who lost only five games in her previous three matches. ""I had the chance to finish it in two. I came out strong in the third set and it's nice to be in the quarters again."" Sharapova will next face Estonian 23rd seed Kaia Kanepi, who upset former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in round three and then beat unseeded Dutchwoman Arantxa Rus on Monday. Kanepi won 6-1 4-6 6-0 against the 21-year-old conqueror of Germany's No. 25 Julia Gorges to match her 2008 effort of reaching the quarters. Shvedova's reward for toppling Li is a clash with Czech fourth seed Kvitova , who thrashed Uzbekistan-born American Varvara Lepchenko 6-2 6-1 to reach the event's last eight for the first time. The 24-year-old Shvedova also reached quarterfinals in Paris in 2010, when she won grand slam doubles titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. However, she was a first-round loser here last year and then at Wimbledon and missed the other two majors as she struggled with injuries. After Sharapova and Kvitova, the highest-ranked player remaining in the last eight is U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur. The sixth-seeded Australian, who was runner-up in Paris in 2010, will next face Azarenka's conqueror Dominika Cibulkova.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova remains on course to complete a career slam after she set up a French Open semifinal showdown with Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. The Russian dispatched Kaia Kanepi, from Estonia, 6-2 6-3 and now needs just two more victories to join an exclusive club in the game who have won all four grand slam titles. The world No. 2 has reached the final four at Roland Garros twice before and beat Kvitova, from the Czech Republic, in the semifinals in Stuttgart -- a tournament she went on to win. But Kvitova's only grand slam win to date came at last year's Wimbledon tournament, when she beat Sharapova in straight sets in the final. ""It's nice to be in this position again,"" Sharapova told the WTA Tour's official website. ""It's my third time in the semifinals here. ""Petra's an extremely tough opponent, someone I have had good success in our last couple of meetings, but they're always tough matches. ""The last one in Stuttgart was a tough two-setter for me -- she had opportunities in that second set and when she's confident, she's dangerous. It's going to be another level. I hope I can raise my level, as well."" None of the four French Open semifinalists has tasted success in Paris, but Sharapova has the most major championships to her name, with three overall. The Russian never looked in any trouble against Kanepi, breaking her opponent seven times en route to a swift victory, and the 26-year-old admitted she could not live with Sharapova's power. ""She attacked all the time, I didn't have any time to hit my shots and I just couldn't get any rhythm out there,"" Kanepi explained. ""I was also very nervous and I am just sorry I didn't get to spend more time on the court. Maria is playing really well, she can win the tournament."" Kvitova, the No. 4 seed, dropped the first set against qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan, who knocked out defending champion Li Na in the previous round, but battled back to win 3-6 6-2 6-4. It ended Shvedova's hopes of becoming the first qualifier ever to reach the Roland Garros semis, and propelled Kvitova closer to her second grand slam final appearance. ""Every point that we played was really tough,"" Kvitova said in a courtside interview. ""I knew that I had to change my game. ""It wasn't easy and I'm really happy that my serve helped me and I played my aggressive game again.""

"(CNN) -- David Nalbandian was disqualified in the ATP Queen's Club final Sunday for angrily kicking down an advertising board and injuring a court side official. The Argentinian was leading Croatia's Marin Cilic by a set and trailed 3-4 in the second, having just dropped his service, when the incident occurred. A Cilic serve to his forehand saw Nalbandian unable to return and he took out his frustration on the board, which was just in front of line judge Andrew McDougall. The force of Nalbandian's kick left McDougall with a nasty gash to his leg and he stood up to protest to the player. Umpire Fergus Murphy halted play before ATP supervisor Tom Barnes came onto the court to speak to him and the 30-year-old Nalbandian, who was officially defaulted for ""unsportsmanlike behavior."" He later returned to apologize for his actions to the 6,000 capacity crowd at the club in London. ""I am sorry to do that. Sometimes we get very frustrated here on court. It is tough to control,"" he said. ""It is a mistake. It is a tough moment to end a final like that. Sometimes we feel the pressure from the ATP. It is a mistake and I have to pay for that. Everybody makes mistakes."" A subdued Cilic was handed the tournament trophy, the first ATP title for the 23-year-old since winning in St Petersburg in October last year. Federer shocked by Haas in Halle final . ""It was very bitter. It's definitely not the way I wanted to win,"" Cilic said. ""I can't change it, but I'm really sorry for the fans that it finished like this."" Tournament director Chris Kermode told BBC Sport that officials had been left with no other option than to default Nalbandian. ""David is struggling to come to terms with it. He clearly regrets what happened -- but these things happen. ""Queen's is sold out and the spectators are watching some great tennis, so to have the match end this way is quite disappointing. ""But there's not a lot we can do about it. We are under the governance of ATP rules."" Kermode added that McDougall had been taken to the tournament's medical center to have attention for his injured leg. An ATP official later told CNN that in their records dating back to 1980 they could not find another instance of a player being disqualified in an ATP final for a similar offense than committed by Nalbandian.","David Nalbandian disqualified in Queen's Club final .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal recovered from a rusty start to power into the second round of Wimbledon with a straight-sets win over Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci on Tuesday. The two-time champion bounced back in style after losing the first four games of the match against the 80th-ranked Bellucci. Nadal won the next four, before smashing his South American opponent 7-0 in the first-set tie break and then wrapping up the remaining sets 6-2 6-3. ""It's always tough to make the change from clay to grass, especially when over the last couple of months I played almost every match on tour,"" said Nadal, who won the French Open earlier this month. ""I had more mistakes than usual and I was very lucky to come back from 4-0."" Champion Kvitova battles through in women's first round . Great Britain's Andy Murray made an impressive start to the tournament as he bids to become the first home winner of the men's singles since Fred Perry in 1936. The world number four made short work of beating Russia's Nikolay Davydenko 6-1 6-1 6-4, and the British number one also looked in peak physical form following recent fitness concerns. But it was a day to forget for Australia's men's players, with none making the second round at the All England Club for the first time since 1938. No. 20 seed Bernard Tomic, who made the quarterfinals last year, slumped to a surprise 3-6 6-3 6-4 6-4 defeat against Belgian wildcard David Goffin. ""I have slacked off a little bit and look what it's costing me. It's a lack of concentration, not working hard,"" admitted the 19-year-old after the defeat. Compatriot Lleyton Hewitt, who was Wimbledon champion 10 years ago but needed a wildcard to qualify after an injury-plagued season, was no match for France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. The No. 5 seed showed no signs of the finger injury he suffered in the recent Aegon Championships, cruising to a 6-3 6-4 6-4 win over his Australian opponent. Spain's Feliciano Lopez, the No. 14 seed, fell to a surprise 7-6 3-6 7-6 6-4 defeat to Finland's Jarkko Nieminen.

"(CNN) -- The stage is set for another classic men's grand slam final on Sunday after Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal set up a French Open showdown with much more than just the title at stake. World No. 1 Djokovic will seek to become the first man since 1969 to hold all four majors at the same time, and only the third ever, while second-ranked Nadal is aiming for a record seventh crown at Roland Garros. Djokovic is through to the Paris final for the first time after avenging last year's semi defeat against the man who ended his 43-match winning streak, Roger Federer. The Serbian struggled to overcome Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets in his previous match, but was dominant against the 16-time grand slam champion on Friday as he triumphed 6-4 7-5 6-3 in just over two hours. Nadal, the modern game's ""King of Clay,"" crushed fellow Spaniard David Ferrer in the opening semifinal as he won 6-2 6-2 6-1 against the sixth seed to take his record at the tournament to 51-1. His only defeat came against Robin Soderling in 2009, when Federer won the title to complete his career grand slam. This year Nadal has not dropped a set in six matches, losing only 35 games in total. ""My level has improved slightly against last year ao I am satisfied and happy because I've already improved,"" said the 26-year-old, who is tied with Bjorn Borg on six titles. ""Last year I had the impression I didn't really play that well; whereas this year I'm playing really well. I am having almost a perfect clay-court season, and we'll see what's going on in the final."" Last year Djokovic beat Nadal in six successive finals, including two on clay, but he hasn't been as dominant in 2012 since overcoming his rival in the longest grand slam title match in history at the Australian Open in January. That followed his Wimbledon and U.S. Open successes in 2011, setting up his tilt at history. Nadal triumphed in straight sets in their final encounters in Monte Carlo -- a tournament where Djokovic played on despite the death of his grandfather -- and Rome last month. While Nadal has strolled through his half of the draw in Paris, Djokovic has twice been taken to five sets as he saved four match-points against home hope Tsonga after retrieving a 2-0 deficit against 22nd seed Andreas Seppi in the previous round. However, Djokovic showed his true class against Federer as he denied the Swiss third seed a chance to win his first grand slam since 2010. ""I am happy to be in the final here, it's always difficult to play against Roger,"" said the 25-year-old, who has hopes of completing a ""Golden Slam"" this year with the addition of the Olympic title. ""It's a dream to be in the final, but Rafa, who always plays so well here, will be the favorite."" Federer was disappointed after blowing a 3-0 lead in the second set, and was also 5-4 ahead. ""He played well under difficult conditions,"" the 30-year-old said. ""But I had chances. There are no excuses. ""I tried and if I had won that second set, it would have been a different match. But it didn't work out."" Rod Laver is the last man to hold all four grand slam titles, and the Australian did it twice in a calendar year -- in 1962 as an amateur and then in 1969 as a professional.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso stretched his lead in the world championship standings with a peerless drive from pole position to win the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim Sunday. The 30-year-old Spaniard was claiming his third victory of the season for Ferrari after wins in Malaysia and the European Grand Prix. He came home just under four seconds clear of the two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull. But Vettel was demoted to fifth for running off the track as he overtook McLaren's Jenson Button on the penultimate lap of 67. He was handed a 20 second penalty by race stewards to leave Britain's Button in second place and Finland's Kimi Raikkonen (Lotus-Renault) in the final podium position. Kamui Kobayashi of Japan was promoted to fourth, with Mexican teammate Sergio Perez (Sauber) in sixth. Home hero and seven-time champion Michael Schumacher was seventh for Mercedes ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber, who lost ground in the title race. German Nico Hulkenberg, who was ninth for Force India, and his compatriot Nico Rosberg, in the second Mercedes, completed the points scoring. 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) saw his title chances further recede after being forced to retire after a puncture picked up from track debris. It followed an early collision between Ferrari number two Felipe Massa and Frenchman Romain Grosjean of Lotus. For Alonso, a third world title beckons after stretching his lead to 34 points over Australia's Webber, with Vettel in third, but 10 points further adrift. ""We'll enjoy the win,"" said Alonso. ""Starting on pole was the key factor because it was difficult to overtake and we were not the fastest but we kept the position."" Vettel told the post-race press conference that he had not intended to hinder Button as he overtook the Briton. ""The last thing you want to do is make contact. When we were side-by-side, I tried to give him enough room -- but it's difficult to see. ""I went wide. We were all struggling with tires, Jenson in particular, which is why I was able to pass him.""","Fernando Alonso wins German Grand Prix at Hockenheim .

"(CNN) -- Russia provided both women's singles finalists at the 2008 Olympic tennis competition, but only one will make it through to the title match at London 2012. Maria Sharapova set up a semifinal showdown with compatriot Maria Kirilenko after overcoming fellow former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters on Thursday. The French Open champion triumphed 6-2 7-5 to end the Belgian's hopes of a first major championship on the hallowed grass of Wimbledon before she retires for a second time at the end of this year. ""It's a nice experience every time you go out on Centre Court so I'm happy to say that my last match at Wimbledon was on Centre Court,"" the 29-year-old Clijsters said. Sharapova completed her collection of grand slam titles by winning the French Open in June, and Russia's first female flag bearer now has the chance to secure a ""Golden Slam."" ""I was just really happy that I was able to step up in terms of the way that I played compared to previous matches,"" she said. Men's big three set for Olympic showdown . Kirilenko, seeded 14th, upset last year's Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 to reach the last four of a top event for the first time in her career. The 25-year-old -- a Wimbledon quarterfinalist last month -- also has a chance to earn a podium place in the women's doubles, reaching the semifinals with Nadia Petrova. The Russians beat China's Peng Shuai and Zheng Jie (7-5 6-7(7-9) 6-4. Serena Williams can also win double gold, which her older sister Venus achieved at Sydney 2000, as she seeks the only major title to elude her so far. The American faces a rematch of her Wimbledon semifinal against world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka after overpowering eighth seed Caroline Wozniacki 6-0 6-3. ""I love playing Victoria,"" said the 14-time grand slam singles winner, who holds an 8-1 career advantage over the Belorussian. ""I have nothing to lose. She is world No.1.

"(CNN) -- Ed Sheeran is ready to become more than the latest musician in a modern British invasion. The singer-songwriter has already struck it big in his native England, becoming one of the top debut artists in the last year. Sheeran's album, ""+,"" debuted on top of the UK album charts in 2011, and it has charted in the Top 10 everywhere from Australia to the Netherlands. Sheeran has performed for the queen, and he will take the stage during the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London. With his mix of acoustic soul, hip-hop beats and personal lyrics, Sheeran is also ready to take on a whole new market: the United States. The artist is off to a good start, having already gained a cult American following since ""+"" shot to a Top 5 debut on the Billboard 200. While doing promotional rounds in the United States, CNN caught up with Sheeran at an intimate fan show for radio station 104.3 MYfm. Sheeran believes the power of the Internet helped to expand his fan base in countries where he had yet to release material. ""Anyone can get my record around the world,"" Sheeran told CNN. ""Anyone can see my music videos around the world; anyone can see me live around the world. It's like, it's a click of a mouse, to be honest. So that has helped out with the fan base everywhere, and especially in America."" Sheeran won two trophies at this year's BRIT Awards, the British equivalent of the Grammys. With the current success of Adele and, on a smaller scale, One Direction and Florence + The Machine, all eyes are on the British music scene to see what else they have to offer. Sheeran, however, doesn't believe this current ""British wave"" is anything new. ""I think [the] Internet has a large amount to do with this invasion that the media are talking about, but I don't think the invasion ended,"" Sheeran told CNN. ""We've been supplying you with music, you've been supplying us with music, and it's a good trade. We get Rihanna, you get Adele."" Now Sheeran is working on creating hits for other A-List artists. He co-wrote a track on One Direction's album and was recently spotted heading into a studio with country music's reigning princess, Taylor Swift. In fact, Swift proclaimed her support for Sheeran on her Twitter page. The superstar Tweeted a link to purchase ""+,"" declaring it ""My favorite album right now."" Sheeran recently performed at the Queen's Jubilee concert outside of Buckingham Palace alongside superstars including Paul McCartney and Elton John. Not only was he the only debut artist in the lineup, but it was that very event that inspired him to get started in music as a child. ""The reason I started playing guitar in the first place was watching the jubilee 10 years ago when I saw Eric Clapton play on TV,"" Sheeran said. ""It's quite a weird full circle, to have 10 years on from the day you started playing guitar [to] playing [that] event. Hopefully, a 10-year-old kid will be watching that and think, 'Yeah, I want to pick up a guitar, as well.' And then 10 years on, they might be playing it.""","Ed Sheeran is one of England's top debut artists in the last year .

"(CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch has stepped down from a string of company boards of directors just one month after his embattled News Corporation announced plans to separate publishing interests from its lucrative television and film operations. The Australian-born media mogul made the move last week, according to a spokesman for News International, a British arm of News Corp. While Murdoch is expected to remain chairman of both companies, he will be CEO of only the television and film side, further distancing himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune. It's not clear who will be CEO of the publishing company, which would be less than one-third the size of its counterpart. The News International spokesman on Saturday played down Murdoch's boards resignation, calling it ""nothing more than a corporate house-cleaning exercise prior to the company split."" Murdoch grilled on power, influence . News Corp., a Murdoch-controlled media conglomerate, is expected to be divided in the next 12 months. The split comes after some of its U.K.-based newspapers were thrust to the center of a recent phone-hacking scandal. His British operations have remained under intense scrutiny after revelations of widespread phone hacking, which included celebrities and public officials, by people working for his newspapers. Gordon Brown lashes out at Rupert Murdoch, son and tabloid . The controversy prompted News Corp. to shut down its venerable British tabloid, News of the World, last year, and preceded a decision to withdraw a multi-billion-dollar bid to take over British Sky Broadcasting. The coming split would separate operations like 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox broadcast network and Fox News Channel from the firm's newspapers holdings such as Britain's The Sun, the London Times and the London Sunday Times. News Corp.'s American media holdings include The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Barron's. Its book publishing assets include such companies as HarperCollins.

"(CNN) -- Some quick thoughts from Tampa just before the Republicans raise the curtain on their second night: . Did Ann move the needle? While some offer dissent, there is general agreement across the political spectrum that Ann Romney stole the show on opening night. Brit Hume at Fox News said she gave the most effective speech he had ever heard from a political wife -- and remembering star turns from Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Barbara and Laura Bush, that is saying a lot. John Cassidy of the New Yorker wrote, ""The night belonged to Ann Romney, and she aced it."" From the CNN skybox, I tweeted, ""In 2004, Barack Obama was born as a national star at the Democratic convention. Tonight it was Ann Romney's turn."" The question now becomes: Did she move the needle for her husband? A few have speculated that she could have lifted his numbers by 4 percentage points. The truth is that we won't know until the numbers come in, but my hunch is, there won't be an obvious bounce. Rather, what she did is to prompt a whole lot of wavering voters to take a second look at her husband Thursday night. That is a huge contribution in a race this tight ... but it is still up to him to close the sale. Opinion: Ann Romney did great, but won't move needle . What must Paul Ryan deliver? The pressure is on Paul Ryan on Wednesday night to do even more than Ann Romney. From a GOP perspective, he is the one who has to keep the base fired up with hard-edged conservatism even as he persuades independents and disillusioned Democrats that they can be comfortable with him as the ideological leader of a Romney presidency. That won't be an easy rope to tread, but Ryan has managed it well. The Romney campaign was drifting badly when Ryan came aboard and has since righted itself. It is true, as analysts like Ezra Klein have written, that Ryan hasn't provided a big lift in national polls, but he has brought a new vitality -- not only to the party (just wait for the hall to erupt Wednesday night when he is introduced) but to Romney himself. And he has put not only Wisconsin in play but possibly more of the upper Midwest. Meanwhile, the downsides that Republican strategists worried so much about when he was named haven't materialized. Democratic attacks on his Medicare ideas, for example, don't seem to be cutting much (perhaps the Democratic convention will change that?). And for some, Ryan's youthful good looks add a little sex appeal. But on Wednesday, he will be on the biggest stage in his life. Those in the hall will want red meat, far more than they got from Chris Christie on Tuesday night, but many in his television audience will be deciding whether they want him at the center of national power -- and only a heartbeat from the presidency. A difficult assignment. This will be the second most important speech of the convention. An election between two transitional candidates? There has been an unmistakable air in Tampa that even as they work for victory, leading Republicans are looking over Romney's shoulder, asking who will be out front if he loses. Christie's much-anticipated speech Tuesday night has drawn scorn because he seemed to be auditioning for himself for 2016. He wasn't giving a keynote, the joke goes, but an acceptance. Rick Santorum's speech, while better, was also less about Romney than his own views. And of course, tensions are running high between Ron Paul and his followers vs. the Romney team. All of this is now coalescing into a narrative on full display in an insightful piece by Jonathan Martin in Politico. Martin writes that supporters of up-and-coming 40-somethings -- from Ryan to Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz -- increasingly see themselves as the true heirs of an upbeat, Reagan-style conservatism and that Romney, at 65, is a more of a placeholder, win or lose. That mood could change over the next two days -- Romney has a self-interest in changing it -- but if it holds, it will add a new dimension to the 2012 election. As he bids for a second term, Barack Obama faces the prospect that if even if he wins, as a lame duck president, power will begin to seep away a couple of years from now. That goes with the territory. So, in a fundamental way, history may one day record that an Obama-Romney race was actually a contest between two transitional figures. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: Ann Romney got the best reviews on the first night of the RNC .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In the year 2050, if Ray Kurzweil is right, nanoscopic robots will be zooming throughout our capillaries, transforming us into nonbiological humans. We will be able to absorb and retain the entirety of the universe's knowledge, eat as much as we want without gaining weight, shape-shift into just about any physical form imaginable, live free from disease and die at the time of our choosing. All of this will be thrust on us by something that Kurzweil calls the Singularity, a theorized point in time in the not-so-distant future when machines become vastly superior to humans in every way, aka the emergence of true artificial intelligence. Computers will be able to improve their own source codes and hardware in ways we puny humans could never conceive. This will result in a paradigm shift that sees mankind coalescing with its own creations: man and machine, merging into one. These grand-scale premonitions are largely based on Kurzweil's law of accelerating returns, which states that the development of technology has been increasing exponentially since the beginning of time. That concept isn't really compelling to the masses until one focuses on the ""knee"" of this exponential curve -- the point where the perpetual doubling of technological growth skyrockets and negates the linear models of progress that people like economists have relied on for so long. Kurzweil says we're just about to start rounding this bend and that the rate of progress will be so great it will ""appear to rupture the fabric of human history."" In other words, we will trump nature and take control of our own evolution. Kurzweil's magnum opus, ""The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,"" outlines the implications of this transition in a way that is simultaneously believable, terrifying, meticulous and mind-bendingly absurd. It was published in 2005. That may seem like only a short time ago, but an incoming technological explosion of nuclear proportions isn't so far-fetched when you consider everything that's changed just between then and now. Twitter, iPhones, the comment on the Facebook wall as the new pickup line? The devices and programs we were using four years ago already seem outdated. ""Transcendent Man,"" a documentary about Kurzweil by filmmaker Barry Ptolemy that was released digitally last week, offers a revealing glimpse inside Kurzweil's mind and elaborates on some of the ideas found in ""The Singularity is Near."" See the rest of ""The Singularity of Ray Kurzweil"" at Motherboard.tv . People like to tag Kurzweil as the ""rightful heir to Thomas Edison,"" and that's not a stretch considering he's responsible for some of the most useful inventions of the past century. An optical-character-recognition machine for the blind that's capable of reading most types of printed text aloud, the CCD flatbed scanner, speech-recognition software, the first synthesizer that created sounds virtually indistinguishable from those produced by their acoustic counterparts, and a whole bunch of other nifty things we can barely comprehend came from Ray's brain. When I met Kurzweil at his office in Boston, he was dressed in a slightly crumpled navy suit jacket and slacks. As he emerged from the columns of books surrounding his desk, he seemed almost meek and startled even though he had postponed our interview by over half an hour. But after speaking with him for two minutes I wouldn't have been surprised if he told me that he had already received artificial neural enhancements and other biological upgrades. His intelligence operates on a higher plane, but his true gift is the ability to distill his complex theories into easily digestible terms. Regardless if you agree with Kurzweil's ideas, he certainly knows more than a few things that the majority of us don't. We'd be really foolish not to listen as closely as possible.","Ray Kurzweil is an inventor, entrepreneur, author and futurist .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka is facing a race against time to be fit for the U.S. Open after succumbing to the frenetic schedule of women's tennis. The Belorussian was forced to withdraw from the Montreal Cup with an injury to her left knee midway through the first set of her opening match against Tamira Paszek on Thursday. With just 17 days until the start of the competition at Flushing Meadows, the Australian Open champion's hopes of adding to her sole grand slam triumph look slim. The 23-year-old reached the semifinals of Wimbledon last month, before going on to compete at the London 2012 Olympics where she won bronze in the singles and gold in the mixed doubles on Sunday. The workload has taken its toll on Azarenka, who will now also miss next week's Cincinnati Masters event. ""The last week took so much energy out of me that I had absolutely no time to recover, and my body is feeling it,"" she told reporters. ""It was a little bit too quick of a transition for me to come and start the training, and I felt my knee just wasn't in good shape. ""It's unfortunate because I was really looking forward to playing here. I have really enjoyed being here. I tried yesterday and today it just got worse. I can't see the point of continuing to play if I can't give even 50% of my game."" Azarenka, who has never made it past the fourth round at the U.S. Open, said she needs rest and recuperation if she is to line up in New York later this month. ""I hope it's a short-term thing. I have to just stop and take a little bit of time off because I had absolutely no rest for a long period of time. I just need to settle it down and go from there. Hopefully there's nothing serious about it,"" she said. ""If I cannot play here, there is no chance for me to play anywhere else. My first goal is to get healthy and make sure I'm 100% ready to play the U.S. Open."" The hectic schedule claimed another victim when world No. 2 Maria Sharapova also pulled out of the WTA Tour event in Cincinnati. The French Open champion, who was defeated in the Olympic final by Serena Williams, missed Montreal due to a stomach virus.

"(CNN) -- Defending Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic has been named as the top men's seed for this year's tournament, with French Open winner Maria Sharapova heading the women's singles seedings. World number one Djokovic retains the top seeding at the All England Club despite his defeat to Rafael Nadal in the French Open final earlier this month. The Spaniard is seeded second ahead of six-time champion Roger Federer, who is seeking a first grand slam win since the 2010 Australian Open. Great Britain's Andy Murray, a losing semifinalist for the last three years, is seeded fourth. However, the Scot's preparations suffered a blow on Wednesday when he was beaten by Janko Tipsarevic at The Boodles exhibition tournament in Buckinghamshire. It was Murray's second successive defeat on grass, following his surprise early exit from the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club last week. France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who suffered an injury scare when he injured a finger at the Aegon Championships, is seeded fifth for Wimbledon.

"Beijing (CNN) -- A video of a toddler crying while running in the snow nearly naked has sparked a firestorm in China, but the boy's father says the exercise was meant to strengthen his son. ""It's tough for me, too, when he cried out for my comfort,"" father He Liesheng said. ""But I believe in 'no pain, no gain.' Like an eagle, I push my child to the limit so he can learn how to fly."" The father shot and posted the online video clip showing his 4-year-old son running down a snow-covered street, wearing only shoes and underpants. In the footage, the boy -- nicknamed Duoduo -- chases his father, sobs and begs to be picked up. ""Daddy, Daddy please hold me,"" Duoduo cries in the video, which was filmed while the family was in Flushing, New York on vacation. The father, who lives in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, said he calls himself ""Eagle Dad"" for his tough parenting skills. He told CNN in a phone interview that the snow run is part of a training regimen of intensive physical and mental activities designed to strengthen his son, who was born premature and has suffered from health problems. ""I consulted my doctor friends to ensure what we do is scientific and that it won't harm my son's body,"" he said. The video has been viewed by tens of thousands of people online. In China, it has reignited debate about how far parents should push their children to attain success. Chinese parenting techniques have come under scrutiny after author Amy Chua's book, ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,"" sparked heated discussion worldwide about the benefits of tough parenting. ""Some compare me to the 'Tiger Mom,' but we are different,"" He told CNN. ""Unlike her, I always respect my son's will."" He said he plans to publish a book on his ""eagle-style"" training soon. But his parenting method might have trouble finding followers. On Weibo, China's version of Twitter, many users said the approach was tantamount to child abuse. ""I can't agree with this educational style,"" a user going by the name of Dangpoluobaoyushangfengweibao posted. ""It's so cruel."" Others suggested government officials should step in. ""Why don't we have a law against this abnormal behavior?"" a user going by the name of Xinhongbaobei wrote. ""Before long, there will be all sorts of lion dads and snake moms who feel justified abusing their children."" The boy's father told CNN he doesn't care about the criticism. ""I've always felt Chinese parents spoil their only child too much,"" he said. ""We don't expose them to nature enough and they get weaker and less competitive compared to foreign children."" In the video, both parents can be heard off camera instructing Duoduo to lie down in the snow. He said he and his wife always ensure their son is happy, and that Duoduo's health has improved because of his unique training regimen. ""My wife strongly opposed my idea in the beginning, but I kept persuading her about the benefits of my method,"" He said. ""She told me she's beyond caring now.""

"(CNN) -- Richard St. Denis is the founder of World Access Project, a nonprofit that provides custom-fit wheelchairs and other mobility aids to people living with disabilities in rural Mexico. In addition to distributing the equipment and showing the recipients how to use it, St. Denis and his group offer sports clinics and events to keep people active. St. Denis, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, credits sports with improving his life after he suffered a spinal-cord injury that left him paralyzed from the waist down. He was once a world-ranked athlete in wheelchair skiing. CNN's Ebonne Ruffins recently spoke with St. Denis about how he and his group are helping people with disabilities benefit from athletics. Ebonne Ruffins: Why did you start including athletics in your group's efforts? Richard St. Denis: The first year, I came down to Mexico and gave a bunch of wheelchairs away, but not everybody used them. Some just sat in their wheelchairs, and they didn't know what to do with them. So I would teach them how to push them. But I realized they needed a lot more then just learning how to push their wheelchairs. So we started teaching them how to do wheelies, how to get around in grass, rough terrain. And then I started teaching them how to play sports: basketball and tennis, mainly. We wanted for them to be more active, to think of the wheelchair as not just something to sit in but something that would make their life better. Ruffins: How does the sports element of your program work? St. Denis: We meet every Saturday morning to play tennis, and we have camps during the summer where able-bodied people and people with disabilities from the U.S. and Mexico participate in a number of sports tournaments. That's always a lot of fun. They meet new friends, and they compete against each other. Outside of the camp setting, some of the players will also compete nationally. One of my students, Tito, is hoping to represent Mexico in the Pan American Games in tennis. Maybe we'll even have some students in the Paralympics one day. Some of them are just really very good. But overall, for all the wheelchair recipients who become active in sports, I think it develops their self-esteem. When people compete in sports, they feel good about themselves. They think, ""If I can play sports, then maybe I can get a job, maybe I can get up out of the house, maybe I can become active."" Ruffins: How did you start competing in sports after your injury? St. Denis: My injury was in 1976, and in 1978, I started playing sports. I started with basketball; everybody (in a wheelchair) always starts with that. And then I got into some field sports: shot put, discus, javelin, road racing and track races like the 100-meter dash and 200-meter dash. About a year later, I decided to take up weightlifting. ... Because my legs don't weigh anything, I would win my division -- and I was competing against able-bodied people! I weighed 145 pounds, and I bench-pressed 335 pounds. I've also competed in the Veterans Games for disabled veterans and participated in four marathons. I think my best time ever for a marathon was 2:01:30. Ruffins: You have done it all. Do you have a favorite sport? St. Denis: Snow skiing is my favorite sport, and tennis is second. What I love about snow skiing is just the independence. You can go as fast or as slow as you want without anyone holding you back. It's complete liberty. I broke my back snow skiing, and in 1990, I ranked third in the world in the downhill skiing event (for the disabled).

"(CNN) -- There is a lot to be said for modesty mixed with self-deprecation when faced with overwhelming odds, but despite his best efforts Louis Nicollin ended up displaying neither of these fine qualities. Last November, when the president and owner of Montpellier -- an unglamorous, unfancied, mid-table team that had shocked itself by leading the French league despite never having troubled the upper echelons before -- was asked about the prospects of his team staying the course, he was incredulous to say the least. ""Montpellier champions? Impossible,"" scoffed Nicollin, who made his money in the refuse industry, in an interview with French sports daily newspaper L'Equipe. ""If I were at PSG (Paris St. Germain), Lyon, Lille or Rennes, and Montpelier finished as champions, I'd want to stab myself in the backside with a sausage. ""What a disgrace that would be!"" Last weekend Nicollin's ""disgrace"" was complete. His Montpellier players were crowned champions of France after a 2-1 victory over Auxerre, fending off PSG -- now one of the richest teams in the world after being bought out by the Qatar Investment Authority -- to secure the club's first ever league title. The victory was remarkable for a number of reasons. For one, Montpellier had never come close to threatening the dominance enjoyed by the likes of Lyon, Marseille or PSG. The last time the club enjoyed any silverware was the French cup 22 years ago. The team was also purchased on a shoestring budget. While PSG could afford to blow €40 million ($51.26 million) on Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore and hire Italian legend Carlo Ancelotti, the biggest outlay by Montpellier's former France under 21 coach Rene Girard was €2 million ($2.56 million) for defender Henri Bedmino. ""It's unbelievable,"" midfielder Younes Belhanda told CNN after the game. ""I think they will stay here until tomorrow night! It's good for us, the fans, the president and the city of Montpellier. We are happy. We came from the academy and we win the league with a low earning club."" Montpellier's entire budget -- €33 million ($42.29 million) -- was less than Pastore's transfer fee. Given their title odds of 80-1 at the start of the season, with a team of journeyman players, no one gave Montpellier a chance. But a 2-2 draw with PSG -- expected to sweep all before them thanks to the club's Middle Eastern money -- at the start of the year changed the complexion of the title race. The team's success -- much like European football's other fairytale league success, for Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona in Israel -- was built not on money but on nurturing young players in the academy, building team spirit and spotting talent and value in footballers previously discarded by everyone else. ""There is an opportunity (in France) for small, well-run clubs (to do well),"" said French football analyst James Eastham, who explained that France has had four different champions in four seasons, which gives opportunities to less well off teams. ""Montpellier have had the same president for decades, invested in youth and haven't spent a lot."" Take John Utaka, the Nigerian who scored the winning goals against Auxerre. He had experienced such a disastrous spell at Portsmouth that no club in England wanted to touch him. France-born Moroccan playmaker Younes Belhanda, the outstanding player in this Montpellier side, has been with the team since he was 13 years old. Striker Olivier Giroud worked his way up through the lower leagues before Montpellier saw him playing for second division Tours. He cost €2million. This season he was the top scorer in the French league. Yet despite the incredulity of the president, the team continued to win until -- like in the English Premier League and Italy's Serie A -- the title race came down to the last game of the season. But still Nicollin didn't entirely believe. He instead offered to have his hair cut in a B.A. Baracus-style mohawk if his team won the title. Sure enough Montpellier passed the final test and Nicollin celebrated by having a drastic new hair cut: a mohawk sprayed orange and blue, the club's colors. Nicollin is 68 years old. ""We had to be strong mentally and to stay focus,"" striker Giroud told CNN. ""The game wasn't easy. We stayed in the game and thanks to John (Utaka) we won. Everybody made a contribution this season. It's the title for a team, a squad and a region."" Yet the ""impossible,"" as Nicollin had claimed, had become possible. Not only that, the success of Montpellier -- a team described as French football's ""ugly ducklings"" by coach Girard -- in one of Europe's top leagues gives hope that in the era of big money in football even the smaller teams have a shot at the biggest prizes. Some think this will be the last time an unfancied team could hope to win the league, given PSG's unlimited funds. But even PSG took notice of the way that Montpellier operated. ""There were a lot of changes, players and coach. It is not easy to shape a team's identity,"" Ancelotti told Reuters of the upheaval at PSG since his arrival last year. But he was magnanimous in defeat, vowing to follow the blueprint set by the team that shocked France. ""We must look for continuity. There will be no revolution ... Montpellier won the title thanks to a style of football they had been building for years.""","Montpellier win the French league for the first time in club's history .
Beat Auxerre 2-1 to beat second placed Paris St. Germain to the title .
No one expected the unfancied club to win; coach called them his ""ugly ducklings""
PSG bought by Qatari investors; one player worth more than entire Montpellier team ."
"(CNN) -- Embattled Romanian President Traian Basescu declared victory late Sunday after low voter turnout appeared to doom a referendum on whether to remove him from office. The Central Electoral Bureau estimated turnout at 45.9%, short of the majority of registered voters needed for the vote to be valid. Basescu had urged his supporters to boycott the polls, telling reporters, ""The best help today is to stay home."" After the polls closed at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), he said voters had rejected a ""coup"" by Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the interim president, Crin Antonescu. Asked if he was certain about the figures, he told them, ""I'm never wrong."" Election officials' estimate was based on a survey of nearly 3,000 polling stations across the country, about 6% of the precincts. They estimated their sampling error at about 3 percentage points. Exit polls from Romanian television stations indicated turnout was about 44% late Sunday, and that the overwhelming majority of those voting favored Basescu's impeachment. That led Ponta to say Basescu ""should strongly consider whether he is still legitimate or not in the office."" ""I believe that any politician that says he can ignore the voice of almost 9 million people is totally unrealistic,"" Ponta said. Ponta's Social Liberal Union (USL) disputed the turnout figures, saying it had estimated 9.2 million people had voted -- slightly over 50% -- which would mean Basescu would be ousted. Final results are expected Monday. Basescu has been suspended since the USL-led parliament voted to impeach him in early July, saying he overstepped his authority by ordering wage and benefit cuts for public workers. Basescu said the measures were needed to meet the terms of a $24 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund for the cash-strapped country, but the move soured many Romanians on his leadership. Romanian president suspended . Opponents also accuse Basescu of cronyism. He took office eight years ago and has already survived one effort to remove him, in 2007. The latest crisis in the southeastern European nation -- slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Oregon -- has sent its currency, the leu, plummeting to record lows. Romanian president faces impeachment . Two pro-Basescu governments have collapsed, paving the way for Ponta's center-left USL to take office. Ponta succeeded in getting lawmakers to not only suspend Basescu, but to remove both speakers of parliament and replace them with allies. In voting Sunday, Ponta expressed anger that the prime minister of neighboring Hungary, Viktor Orban, had urged Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority not to vote. ""I want Romanians to decide their own fate,"" Ponta said. Ponta is dealing with his own controversy: He has been accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. He has dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu. Journalist Cosmin Stan contributed to this report.","NEW: Election officials estimate turnout at 46% .

"(CNN) -- Just four days after winning her fifth Wimbledon crown, Serena Williams overcame the effects of jet lag to successfully begin the defense of her Bank of the West Classic title in Stanford, California. The American made a smooth transition from the London grass courts -- which she will return to for the Olympics later this month -- and an eight-hour time difference as she beat college champion Nicole Gibbs 6-2 6-1 in the second round of the hard-court event. ""I definitely felt a little sluggish today, but it was fine, and it was good to get that win,"" Williams told reporters after winning against the 19-year-old wildcard entrant to register her 25th victory in 26 matches. ""It's really bright out there too -- I was so used to all the gloom in London and all the clouds . ""I'll feel better after having tomorrow off and more time to get adjusted. I'm still waking up at like two in the morning."" Gibbs, who is also the NCAA doubles champion, idolized Williams as a child, even serving as a ballgirl for her at age 12. ""When I played Monica Seles for the first time it was pretty cool. To think someone would still want to be like me is kind of awesome,"" the 30-year-old Williams said. Gibbs won her opening match against Thailand's world No. 174 Noppawan Lertcheewakarn, who did not make it through qualifying at Wimbledon, but found a much tougher challenge in 14-time grand slam champion Williams. ""It was a great experience -- it was really good to match up against that level and see what's out there,"" said Gibbs, who was appearing in the main draw of a WTA Tour event for the first time. ""She's such a hero in my mind and so built up in my mind, but I think I was definitely more in the match than I had anticipated being. After a few points I felt I could at least compete at that level."" Williams was full of praise for her opponent too, adding, ""I think she played really well -- she moves really well and she doesn't quit, and I think that's the best quality you can have as an athlete, and especially as a tennis player. ""She could have easily given up and she didn't. She's a fighter. And she has a really good first serve. I think she really held her own today."" Williams will next face sixth seed Chanelle Scheepers after the South African beat Portuguese wildcard Michelle Larcher de Brito to reach her first top-level quarterfinal. ""Serena will definitely be a challenge, but I'm ready to go out and just enjoy it,"" said Scheepers, who lost to Williams in straight sets in their only previous meeting.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Two giants in the world of club football clash on Saturday in a game so entwined in Spanish history and culture it even has its own nickname. Many ingredients combine to create the potent El Clasico brew, a game that pitches Real Madrid against Barcelona. Barcelona give then champions Real Madrid a guard of honour before last season's El Clasico. Rivalry between city-clubs for national dominance is common to most nations, but in Spain there is extra spice between the two largest conurbations in that Barcelona is situated in, and representative of, the autonomous region of Catalonia. The Catalan community is distinct within Spain with its own language, culture and strong sense of identity; situated on the banks of the Mediterranean, the team is seen as an extension to this, hence the club's motto of ""more than a club"" and the appearance of the Catalan national flag on its badge. Real, on the other hand, hail from the capital Madrid, home to the offices of government, the Royal Palace and the larger population. Indeed, Spain's King Alfonso XIII gave the club patronage in 1920 and consequently the Royal Crown appears on the side's badge to this day. The rifts between the two sides have been exacerbated with wrangles over player transfers down the ages too. Both clubs laid claim to the signature of the all-time great Alfredo Di Stefano, only for Real to win through and to reap the rewards of his 307 goals for the side. Barcelona fans threw a pig's head onto the pitch in the 2002 El Clasico European Cup semifinal to vent their anger at former Barca player Luis Figo, who moved to Real two years earlier. More recently Real Madrid let the talent of Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o leave their ranks, only for the striker to move to Barca where he has so far netted over one hundred goals. Another thorn in the side of Barcelona fans is the edge Real have over their rivals in the silverware stakes: since the first meeting of the clubs in 1902, Real have accumulated 31 league championships and a record 9 European Cups against Barcelona's tally of 18 league titles and two European Cups. Which way do you think El Clasico and the Primera Liga title will go? Let us know in the Sound Off box below. With this in mind, Saturday's meeting between the two clubs at Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium, which can hold over 70-thousand passionate fans, threatens to be as explosive as ever. Especially as this season, under the tutelage of Catalan manager Pep Guardiola, Barcelona have seen their 12-point lead at the top of the table eaten up by their previously written-off arch-rivals. So could the destiny of this year's Primera Liga hinge on the second installment of this season's El Clasico? Below are the viewpoints of two ardent fans ahead of the game: . Dani Linares-Lopez, Real Madrid fan: . Real fan Dani Linares shares a pre-El Clasico drink with a fellow fanatic befores last season's game . ""I'm a Real Madrid supporter -- we can't fear the Catalans. I was at the Bernabeu last year when Madrid beat Barcelona 4-1 and they had to give our players a guard of honor as the champions. It was beautiful. ""We're out to take the title again as we've got nothing else to focus on. We'll go out all guns blazing and I think we'll win because we're more up for it than they are. ""I do think Barcelona will still win the league by a point, though. But you never know because Barcelona have the Champions League and the Spanish Cup final to distract them and a few injuries would change things. ""Some bookmakers paid out on Barcelona winning the title after they beat Madrid at the Camp Nou. Everyone thought it was all over, even me. But Juande Ramos has turned it around by training the players harder and now they're really fit. We've been winning ugly but we've kept on winning. Ramos should be given the job permanently if we win the title."" Prediction: 2-1 or 3-2 to Real Madrid . Reda Benzakour, Barcelona fan: . Barca fan Reda Benzakour with Barcelona forward Lionel Messi. ""As a Barca fan El Clasico is THE game that I look forward for the whole season.  Last year was a frustrating and bitter experience. Frustrating during the first leg in Camp Nou where Barca dominated the whole game but failed to score an equalizer. Bitter because during the second leg at the Bernabeu, we were humiliated by the score and the Barca players gave a ""guard of honor"" for Real players for the title won before the game. ""As a Barca fan, this was the worst of scenarios and the culmination of years of humiliation. Real will have to attack if they want to win this game and stay in the race for the title. But I'm confident that Barca will bring a good result from Madrid. Also I'm sure the Barca players are keen to avenge last year's humiliation. It will decide the title because if we win it will give us a 7 point-lead and confidence to go forward and for Real it will take the wind out of their sails.""

"(CNN) -- An overlooked female pinkie bone put in storage after it was discovered in a Siberian cave two years ago points to the existence of a previously unknown prehistoric human species, anthropologists say. And the lineage of that species may survive today in some people in Papua New Guinea and nearby islands, scientists say. A report on the discovery of the finger was published in the December 23 edition of the scientific journal Nature. Anthropologists say the 30,000- to 50,000-year-old finger is evidence of a new population of hominids they call Denisovans. The name is derived from the southern Siberian cave in which the finger bone was found. Geneticists say the finger probably belonged to a 6- or 7-year-old girl. ""The whole story is incredible. It's like a surprising Christmas present,"" said Carles Lalueza Fox, a Spanish paleontologist not involved in the research who was quoted in the online article. The 3 billion-letter nuclear genome derived from the child's finger shows that the ice-age population of early humans was more diverse than previously thought. Also, a comparison of the genome to modern humans indicates that Melanesian inhabitants of Papua New Guinea and various South Pacific islands inherited as much as 5 percent of their DNA from Denisovans. The genome research was conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. The Denisovans, the scientists say, were more closely related to Neanderthals than modern humans. The discovery in Siberia suggests they may have lived across a wide swath of Asia and are likely to have intermingled with the ancestors of modern humans who migrated eastward from Africa.","A small bone found in a cave in Siberia could indicate a new species of early humans .

"(CNN) -- Sixty-six people have died from West Nile virus infections this year, and the number of human cases has grown to 1,590, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. That's the highest case count through the last week of August since the virus was first detected in the United States in 1999. Nearly half of all the infections have occurred in Texas, where officials said later Wednesday that 894 cases have been reported along with 34 deaths. ""Those numbers are going to go up,"" said Dr. David Lakey, commissioner for the Texas Department of State Health Services. Lakey said it looks like 2012 will be the worst year so far when it comes to West Nile virus cases. In 2003, Texas reported 40 deaths because of the virus, and health officials believe they will surpass that number this year. All lower 48 states are now reporting West Nile activity, and 43 states have reported at least one person infected with the virus. Fast facts on West Nile virus . More than 70% of all West Nile virus cases in the United States are found in six states: Texas, South Dakota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Michigan, according to the CDC. While the CDC said these are the highest number of cases reported by the last week in August since the disease was first recorded in 1999, it's not the highest number the country has seen. In 2003, the United States had 9,862 reported cases of West Nile virus, and in 2002 there were more than 4,100 cases and 284 fatalities. In more than half the current nationwide cases, West Nile has led to neuroinvasive disease -- serious illnesses like meningitis, encephalitis or virus-associated paralysis. About 10% of these cases can be fatal, according to the CDC, and a high proportion of those who survive can be left with longstanding neurological problems. Older people are more vulnerable to severe illness from West Nile. So far, the median age among those with neuroinvasive disease this year is 58. In Texas, nearly two-thirds of all cases are in people older than 50. Health officials do not yet know why there are more cases this year than in recent years. Based on previous experiences with floods and hurricanes, health officials do not believe Hurricane Isaac will have a major impact on this year's outbreak. Mosquitoes that spread the virus breed in small nutrient-rich pools of water, such as the water found in old tires, so a large rainfall event or flooding usually washes out those small pools and eliminates breeding sites, said Dr. Lyle Petersen, who heads the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Infections. But after the water recedes, there's always the possibility that new small pools of water will form. Petersen urged the public to take proper precautions to prevent getting sick regardless of whether they live in a state with high or low case counts. To reduce your risk of exposure to mosquitoes and to prevent their breeding sites: . -- Drain all standing water from flower pots, old tires, clogged rain gutters, etc., where mosquitoes breed. -- Use an insect repellant that contains DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus. -- Also wear long sleeves and long pants to protect your skin when you're outside. -- Stay indoors at dusk and dawn because that's when mosquitoes are most active. West Nile outbreak largest ever in U.S.","More than 1,590 cases of the virus are reported .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova's bid to end her long wait for a second Wimbledon crown came crashing to a halt on Monday, while Kim Clijsters' final appearance at the grass-court grand slam also finished in round four. World No. 1 Sharapova lost her rematch with Sabine Lisicki, who she beat in last year's semifinals before losing the title match. Sharapova won the event as a 17-year-old in 2004 to announce herself as a new star in women's tennis, but the defeat by Petra Kvitova 12 months ago is the closest she has come to a repeat success in London. German 15th seed Lisicki powered past her Russian opponent to win 6-4 6-3 and set up a last-eight clash with eighth-seeded compatriot Angelique Kerber, who thrashed former No. 1 Clijsters 6-1 6-1 in just 49 minutes. It is the first time that two German women have made it to the second week of the tournament since 1995, when Steffi Graf won the title for the sixth time and Anke Huber lost in round four. ""It's just unbelievable. I'm so happy. I had lost the last three meetings with her, so it's nice to finally win one,"" said Lisicki, who had lost five matches in a row coming into Wimbledon, including a first-round defeat at the French Open. ""I just went for my shots out there. I felt great, it's my favorite tournament. I love the crowd and playing on grass. I'm a fighter and I fight to the last game. I think I'm getting better with each match."" Sharapova, who won the French Open last month after losing in January's Australian Open final, struggled after going 3-1 down in the opening set and a 45-minute rain delay did not help her get back into rhythm. ""She did many things better than I did. She played very well,"" said Sharapova, who saved two match-points. ""I could have done things differently but not on this particular day."" Four-time grand slam champion Clijsters, who has never got past the semifinals at Wimbledon, could not get going against Kerber -- who fired 19 winners to 10, and just five unforced errors to the Belgian's 13. Clijsters, 29, will retire for the second time following September's U.S. Open, a tournament she has won three times. ""I think the first year that I played here, I was here just to take it all in. I don't even think I was here to play tennis. I needed to just open my eyes and look at everything,"" Clijsters said of her first Wimbledon appearance in 1999. ""It was such an amazing thing. To me this was like Disneyland to another child. It was such a beautiful thing."" In the other half of the Wimbledon draw, four-time winner Serena Williams will face defending champion Petra Kvitova in the quarterfinals after both battled through with three-set victories. Williams, seeking her first grand slam title since 2010, triumphed 6-1 2-6 7-5 against Kazakhstani Yaroslava Shvedova out on Court Two. Shvedova won a record 24 points out of 24 in her first set against French Open runnerup Sara Errani on Saturday, but made a poor start in windy conditions before battling back to level. Williams, bouncing back from her first-round exit at Roland Garros, hit 35 winners to 24, and made 13 unforced errors to her opponent's 20. ""The bottom line is I can play so much better than I am. If I couldn't do better that would be a problem,"" Williams said. World No.4 Kvitova has never beaten the American sixth seed, losing both meetings in 2010 at the Australian Open and then the Wimbledon semifinals. The Czech left-hander came from behind against 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone as she beat the Italian 4-6 7-5 6-1. Schiavone, at 32 the oldest player left in the draw, paid for her 13 double faults and struggled to keep her cool after slipping on the wet grass at the end of the second set. World No. 37 Tamira Paszek reached the quarterfinals for the second year in a row, beating Italian 21st seed Roberta Vinci 6-2 6-2. The 21-year-old Austrian, who has lost in the first round of five of her last six grand slam appearances, will next face second seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. Australian Open champion Azarenka was unaffected by a rain break as the roof was closed on Centre Court as she demolished Serbia's Ana Ivanovic 6-1 6-0 in a battle of former world No. 1s. Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska will feature in the quartefinals for the first time since 2009 after beating 20-year-old Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi 6-2 6-3. Radwanska, 23, who also reached the last eight in 2008, will next play Russian 17th seed Maria Kirilenko -- who beat China's No. 30 Peng Shuai 6-1 6-7 (8-6) 6-3. Kirilenko's only other grand slam quarterfinal appearance was at the 2010 Australian Open, while Peng is yet to get that far in singles play.","World No. 1 Maria Sharapova loses fourth-round match against Sabine Lisicki .

"(CNN) -- How big is the financial hole? This is the main question among Spaniards nowadays. They want to know how much money Bankia, the country's fourth-largest bank, needs. Bankia was created in 2010, a result of the merger of seven small entities including Caja Madrid and Bancaja. Such cajas -- regional savings banks with board members appointed by the local authorities -- devoted part of their profits to social purposes within their areas. They fell into enormous debt due to their investments in infrastructure, and thousands of houses which were never sold. Bankia was a proposal of the ruling Popular Party (PP, conservatives). The idea was to merge the saving banks and give an executive role to Rodrigo Rato, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund and first chairman of Bankia. Before these posts, Rato was Minister of the Economy and Treasury in the first and second cabinet of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who led the country between 1996 and 2004. Rato was idolized in the conservative media, and credited with the previous cycle of economic growth. All was running smoothly until May, when the current Minister of Economy, Luis de Guindos, forced Rato to resign as Bankia president while the CNMV (the Spanish agency for financial markets) suspended the stock exchange of Bankia when its price slumped to half its original value. Now, as Bankia sucks up financial aid, Spaniards wait to hear news of cuts to their welfare state. Every Friday could be a Black Friday, because it's always Friday in Spain when cuts and bad news arrives at the cabinet meeting. The government recently approved a â‚¬10 billion euro ($12 billion) cut in education and health programs, and will most likely announce it will spend â‚¬23 billion ($28 billion) to rescue Bankia. So what do the people think? According to the CIS, the public agency for surveys, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has gone from a rate of approval of 45% in January to 38% in May -- a significant drop considering he won the elections with an absolute majority only six months ago. People, especially youth (for whom unemployment rates are above 51%), find it difficult to understand there is no money for healthcare or universities, but enough to go around when it comes to rescue banks or pay severance packages to bankers who have ruined their companies. Up to now, no one has resigned empty handed. But not everything is bad news for the government and its party. Their main competitor, the Socialist Party (PSOE, center-left), trails in the polls. Although it has won two regional elections this Spring (Andalusia and Asturias), its leader Alfredo P. Rubalcaba generated ""little"" or ""no"" confidence among 78.8% of the Spaniards, according to the latest survey carried out by the CIS. So what happens now? All the parties in opposition have asked the government to open an inquiry into the Bankia case. It is difficult to justify the billions in cost without knowing exactly what happened. Meanwhile, summer is on the way. In Spain, this is the time when political life is paralyzed and tourism boosts job prospects, especially in the coastal towns. Demonstrations, strikes and protests will probably be forgotten until September. While transport prices and university fees rise, and the government increases taxes and lowers pensions, people prefer to stay at home and support La Roja (Spanish national soccer team) and wait until it is cooler to take the streets. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julio Embid.","Julio Embid: Spaniards want to know how much money Bankia needs .

Aimee Copeland has two hooks she uses for hands and a leg prosthetic but her injured left side where she lost that leg may require one more surgery, Andy Copeland told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Andy Copeland said his daughter is racing through rehab and might return to the family's home on August 22. Even getting used to the hooks didn't seem difficult, Andy Copeland said. ""It's interesting ... after having those hooks on for about 10 minutes she seemed to be able to master the ability to use them,"" he said, adding that she was able to pick up a pair of shorts she had on her wheelchair at the rehabilitation facility and threw them across her body. ""The prosthetist looked at that and said, 'Wow, it usually takes three days for somebody to be able to master the coordination of using those hooks to be able to do something like that.'"" Copeland's ordeal began May 1 when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and received a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Andy Copeland: 'I have become a better father because of Aimee' Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. She spent two months in an Augusta, Georgia, hospital before being released July 2 and starting rehab. ""The regimen that she is under right now is incredible,"" Andy Copeland said. Her workouts include 200 crunches in seven minutes, 400 leg lifts in the same time span and an ""untold"" number of pushups. The physical therapy takes about 90 minutes a day, he said. ""So she's really pushing it hard right now,"" he added. When Aimee Copeland does return home, she will find a new ""Aimee's Wing"" on the Copeland's residence in Snellville, just east of Atlanta. The nearly 2,000 square foot addition will include access ramps, an elevator to the home's second floor, an exercise room Aimee will use to continue her recovery, guide rails in the bathroom, and a separate wash sink Aimee can use to clean her prosthetics. The cost of building the wing is being donated by builder Pulte Homes. Aimee wants a quiet homecoming, Andy Copeland said. He told her he was going to have a big crowd there to document the event but said his daughter doesn't want anyone to make a big deal out of it. A medical home makeover begins . ""I don't need that,"" she said to him. ""I just need to come home."" On his blog, Andy Copeland related the story of how his daughter reacted when he told her he was getting a van with a wheelchair lift. Aimee wanted no part of it, he wrote. She wants to drive herself around in a Prius. ""The simple fact is that between her ears, Aimee is 100%,"" he wrote. ""She knows that she can accomplish anything she wants and that lacking the hands or feet to accomplish such tasks is only a minor inconvenience."" A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome. When the bacteria get into the bloodstream, such as through a cut, doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Family counters flesh-eating bacteria with faith .","Aimee Copeland has been fitted with prosthetics for her hands, one leg .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Mika knows how to dress for the occasion. Mika's new album, ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much,"" acknowledges some of his teen issues. The singer showed up to CNN.com's interview in bright blue felt suspenders, or ""braces"" as they're called in his UK homeland; ""suspenders"" are the naughty things ladies wear to keep their stockings up. ""On CNN you've got a thing about suspenders, don't you?"" he says, referring to Larry King's penchant for wearing them. (CNN International anchor Richard Quest is fond of suspenders as well.) ""So I thought, why not join the ranks?"" Not that Mika, born Michael Holbrook Penniman, likes to do what everyone else is doing. His 2007 breakout album, ""Life in Cartoon Motion,"" introduced him as an eccentric, wild-haired singer with a falsetto voice that might've seemed out of place on the modern pop scene. But he certainly commanded attention.  Watch Mika hold the scene » . Fueled by peppy hits such as ""Love Today"" and ""Grace Kelly,"" Mika's bejeweled star shot high, with more than 6 million albums sold worldwide and top fashion designers wanting to dress him (Christian Louboutin designs shoes for the 6-foot-4 singer). Mika, 26, now has a follow-up album, ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much,"" which addresses some of the awkwardness he experienced as a teen. ""I was terrified of talking to people,"" he says. ""I was a bit of a loner. I'm angry with myself about that. I wish I had more guts when I was younger because then I would've said things to people's faces instead of just running away all the time."" No matter. Now he just turns his gripes into songs. ""If you put a message and a catchy melody together, suddenly they want to listen to what you're saying. That's the thing about pop music: it hoodwinks you into listening to it before you even know what it's talking about. I guess that's why I fell in love with it. It's funny because I think when you look at most of the people in the world who write pop music, they were never popular when they were younger."" Tracking Mika . Mika kicks off a 10-city North American tour in Toronto, Canada, on October 12. Check his Web site for dates, or just listen out for the ""doom da da di da di doom da da di da di."" Like pop, like comics . Mika and his sister do all the illustrations for his album artwork and posters. Says Mika: ""I'm a big illustration and comic book fan. In my eyes, comic books and illustration are the same kind of art forms. They're immediate. It has to hit you really fast. Pop music works from the same principles. In comic books, you always have black outlines. It's almost like the melody of a pop song is the black outlines you find in a comic book."" Mum kills the fun . Mika had booked a luxury home in Beverly Hills, California, as a base to record his new album. But two days before he was to move in, his mother put the kibosh on the plans and insisted her son work from the same dingy apartment he recorded his debut. ""Mum said the more money you spend on your comfort, the worse your album will be. You make the choice."" He relented. Was it worth it? ""No! I still wish I stayed in the big fancy house. It would've been a lot more fun!"" How high can he go? Mika: ""Some people say I've got a five-octave range, which is ridiculous. That would mean I'd sing like Mariah Carey or that alien in 'The Fifth Element.' And I'm nothing like that blue alien. I've got a range of about 3 1/2 octaves.""","Mika's new album is ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much""

"(CNN) -- The wind blew hard at Wimbledon on Friday, but world No. 1 Maria Sharapova overcame the tricks of one of her former junior rivals to stay on course for a potential quarterfinal showdown with Kim Clijsters. Sharapova is seeking to follow up her first French Open title by again winning the grass-court crown she so memorably lifted as a 17-year-old in 2004. She reached the last 16 with a 6-1 6-4 victory over Taiwan's Su-Wei Hsieh to move a step closer to a meeting with former No. 1 Clijsters. However, the Russian must first get through a rematch with German 15th seed Sabine Lesicki, who she beat in last year's semifinals before losing the title match against Petra Kvitova. Clijsters, playing her last Wimbledon ahead of her second retirement at the end of this year, must beat another German, eighth seed Angelique Kerber, if she is to have any chance of reaching her first final in the London grand slam. Sharapova struggled with her serve in the gusty conditions, delivering five double-faults as she needed to come back from 4-2 down in the second set. ""I faced her many times in the juniors and she used to be a nightmare for me because she used to slice and drop shot on clay,"" Sharapova said. ""I was like, 'Where did she learn how to play tennis like that? Uses both hands, switches rackets.' We had real battles in the juniors. ""I hadn't played her since then, but I knew her game really well. I don't think she had time to do all of that today on grass. If I'm hitting a hard shot, I don't think she has time to create, which is something she really likes to do. That's her game, hitting a lot of drop shots and slices and getting people kind of crazy."" Sharapova has now won all seven third-round matches she has played at Wimbledon without dropping a set. She has a 3-0 career advantage over Lisicki, who had lost five matches in a row before the start of this tournament after reaching the fourth round at the Australian Open and also last September's U.S. Open. ""Maria is a great competitor and fights for every point. She obviously has a lot of confidence, coming off the French Open now,"" said the 22-year-old, who beat American teenager Sloane Stephens 7-6 (7-5) 1-6 6-2. ""She hits it flat and hard and she's a champion, winning so many grand slams. It's nice to play her again -- I like challenges and I'm looking forward to the big match again."" Clijsters, twice a semifinalist at Wimbledon, moved into the fourth round when Russian opponent Vera Zvonareva had to retire due to breathing difficulties when trailing 6-3 4-3. ""I heard her cough a couple of times and it didn't sound good. It's unfortunate. I saw after long rallies it took her a little while to recover,"" the Belgian said of the 12th seed, who beat her in 2010 on the way to the final. Kerber, who reached the last eight at Roland Garros and the semifinals at the 2011 U.S. Open, defeated American 28th seed Christina McHale 6-2 6-3 to achieve her best result on the hallowed grass turf. Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska also reached the last 16 as she ended the hopes of 20-year-old British player Heather Watson, cruising to a 6-0 6-2 win. Radwanska, a quarterfinalist in 2008 and 2009, will next face 20-year-old Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi -- making only her second grand slam appearance after a first-round loss last year. Giorgi, ranked 145th, followed up her upset of 16th-seeded compatriot Flavia Pennetta in the opening round to oust Russian No. 20 Nadia Petrova 6-3 7-6 (8-6). Chinese 30th seed Peng Shuai eliminated the conqueror of U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur, winning 6-1 6-2 against 21-year-old Dutch player Arantxa Rus to match last year's effort of reaching the fourth round. Peng will next play Maria Kirilenko following the Russian 17th seed's 6-3 6-1 crushing of Romania's Sorana Cirstea -- who shocked French Open champion Li Na in the second round.","Top seed Maria Sharapova through to the last 16 after beating Su-Wei Hsieh on Friday .

"Warsaw (CNN) -- In the estimation of Mitt Romney and his top campaign aides, there were no gaffes, no mistakes, no ill-advised statements on the Republican candidate's overseas trip. The poorly timed comments at the Olympics? No big deal. The remarks in Israel that inflamed the Palestinians? Overblown. The off-color words to the press by a Romney aide Tuesday? In the heat of the moment. A trip that was supposed to show off the former governor's foreign policy expertise during an election year has been plagued with distractions as well as marked by substantive highlights. Team Obama seeks to convert on Romney ""fumbles"" Still, as the candidate wrapped up his last leg in Poland, a senior Romney adviser said the campaign will land back in the U.S. late Tuesday, supremely confident of the results on the ground. ""I think it was a great success,"" Romney adviser Stuart Stevens said after the GOP contender's foreign policy speech in Warsaw, the last leg of the campaign's three-country tour. ""The idea is that, can people get a good sense of who he is? Can people listen and see that this is a person speaking from the heart about Israel and about Poland? And he is,"" Stevens added. In a speech at Poland's national library, Romney offered an emotional tribute to the former Soviet bloc country's journey from the Iron Curtain to the economic envy of Europe. ""I, and my fellow Americans, are inspired by the path of freedom tread by the people of Poland,"" Romney said. Romney blames media for bad press . In its final hours in Poland, the Romney campaign talked of its ""great success"" while being bombarded by criticism over moments that did not go so well. For Romney, the trouble began in Britain, when he publicly questioned whether London was ready to host the Summer Olympic Games. British Prime Minister David Cameron retorted that it was far more difficult to organize the Olympics in a world capital than in the ""middle of nowhere,"" a not-so-subtle dig at Romney's Games in Salt Lake City. London tabloids dubbed Romney ""Mitt the Twit."" Romney talks tough but differs little from Obama on Iran . But on the campaign's chartered flight from London to the next leg of the trip, Israel, Romney's policy advisers declined to comment on the candidate's comments. Israel brought more controversy. In one of the great stage-crafting moments of his campaign, Romney delivered a stout defense of Israel's right to exist. He warned Iranian leaders that weaponizing the country's nuclear program would lead to war. However, Romney also outraged Palestinians leaders with his talk of Jerusalem as the undisputed capital of Israel. He commented at a fundraiser in the same city that ""culture"" can partly explain the economic disparity between Israelis and Palestinians, inflaming the already raw feelings in the region. Romney was in no mood to answer questions from his traveling press corps about his ""from the heart"" straight talk. He took only three questions from the journalists after his overseas trip. After Romney paid tribute at the Polish Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, members of the traveling press attempted to ask about some of his perceived gaffes, only to be shouted down by the campaign's traveling press secretary. ""Kiss my ass. This is a holy site,"" Rick Gorka barked at one reporter. ""Shove it,"" he said to another. Gorka later called two reporters and apologized. After Romney's speech, Stevens noted, the candidate did sit down for a number of interview with U.S. television networks, including CNN. ""The reports that we get back are very positive,"" Stevens said of reviews the campaign's trip is receiving from supporters. Team Obama: Romney trip an 'embarrassing disaster' Before the campaign aide's verbal assault on the press, conservative bloggers were protesting that Romney's overseas trip was being judged unfairly in the media. ""By any reasonable standard, Romney's trip has been successful. Yet press coverage has been unrelentingly negative,"" Powerline blog writer John Hinderaker wrote. Greta Van Susteren, an anchor on the Fox News Channel, Romney's go-to network for interviews, had a different assessment of the coverage. ""There has been no press access to Governor Romney since we landed in Poland. We (press) are in a holding pattern (I can't help but feel a bit like the press is a modified petting zoo since we are trapped in a bus while Polish citizens take pictures of us.),"" Van Susteren wrote on her blog. When Romney returns to the states, he will be greeted by a slew of new ads from his campaign and from super PACs supporting him, as well as a new iPhone and Android mobile app called ""Mitt's VP,"" about his VP selection process. Even while away, the campaign never stops. Who should Romney pick for his VP? Let us know your choice on CNN iReport.","Romney's camp says trip successful, getting good reviews .

"(CNN) -- The election of 2012 is a critical juncture in the history of this nation. We now have to decide if we love our country enough to do the responsible thing -- rein in out-of-control spending, cut the debt and reform crumbling entitlement programs. This will not be easy, but it's right and what's necessary for the preservation of our republic. Rep. Paul Ryan is the right choice for such a time. The president has not led; Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will lead, and ultimately, they will lead us back on the path to prosperity. Ryan's path to vice presidential nominee is a culmination of decades of outspoken conservatism. Early on, only a few of his colleagues at Empower America, a conservative, free-market Washington think tank, like Jack Kemp and me, heard him. Now, the entire country will hear him. The effervescent congressmen from Wisconsin, who leads Congress in grueling P90X workouts most mornings, first emerged onto the national political scene with his Roadmap, a first of its kind detailed plan to reform America's budget, tax code, health care system and Social Security system. He said what few politicians would say -- America has overspent, over-promised and under-delivered. Opinion: Is Paul Ryan for or against Ayn Rand? Over time this young budget guru, who once told me he relaxes by kicking back with actuarial tables, began to master the U.S. budget in a way that few ever have. He was appointed to be a member of the president's Bowles-Simpson Commission, but, not yielding to political pressure, voted against its recommendations because it failed to adequately reform Medicare. So, together with Alice Rivlin (Bill Clinton's former OMB director), Ryan co-authored the Ryan-Rivlin plan to seriously reform Medicare (although she didn't support the version of it he included in his all-encompassing budget). Their plan fell largely on deaf ears, but just because Washington wasn't listening, Ryan didn't stop leading. He joined forces with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, to co-author a bipartisan plan to reform Medicare. Their plan leaves Medicare intact for existing recipients and those approaching eligibility and offers future enrollees a chance to enroll in the traditional Medicare government option or enroll in a premium support plan, where seniors can choose from a variety of competitive plans that work best for them. During his tenure as House Budget Chairman, Ryan has penned several of the House budget plans. Although his 2012 budget didn't pass the Democrat-led Senate, it garnered far more votes than President Obama's budget, and proposed far more serious reforms. Donna Brazile: Ryan's dangerous vision . Ryan's conservative credentials are unquestionable. Republicans will never forget how he grilled President Obama at the health care summit in 2010. But, equally important, if not more, is his record of bipartisan leadership. When the time comes and Democrats demonize Ryan's Medicare reform plans, he can hold up Wyden and Clinton-era welfare reformers as his defenders. More than budget and economic expertise, and he has a lot of it, Ryan brings to the Romney ticket a clear, detailed vision forward for America, a vision that stretches across party lines. Ryan adds youthful optimism and a dash of Jack Kemp's infectious charisma to Gov. Romney's business prowess and management skills. For Romney this is the bold action many in his party have been waiting for. All the cards are now on the table. Two competing visions of America's future -- one a nation governed by a large, intrusive caretaker and the other a nation of small government and individual autonomy -- are at stake this November. As has been well said about our founding, we are a nation of choice and reflection. If the American people listen to Romney and Ryan and their serious proposals to restore American prosperity, Romney and Ryan have a chance at winning. If the American people listen to political pandering and ad hominem attacks, they will probably lose. Romney and Ryan will now make the case; the American people will decide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett says choice of Paul Ryan puts the cards on the table before America .
He says Ryan has dedicated himself to mastering the U.S. federal budget .
Bennett says Ryan has proposed innovative solutions and has worked with Democrats .
He says voters will choose between two visions of the size and role of government ."
"(CNN) -- The task facing Agnieszka Radwanska in her first Grand Slam final is a daunting one, because in the opposite corner is Serena Williams, who'll be gunning for a 14th major singles titles. Radwanska, the No. 3 seed from Poland, defeated Angelique Kerber 6-3 6-4 on Centre Court to book her place in a showpiece final for the first time in her fledgling career. And her opponent will be 30-year-old Williams, who also recorded a straight sets win, disposing of the No. 2 seed Victoria Azarenka 6-3 7-6. Williams has won four singles crowns at the All England Club, the last of them coming in 2010, and powered past Azarenka, from Belarus, firing down 24 aces and 45 winners. By reaching her seventh Wimbledon final, she becomes the first 30-year-old to do so since 22-time Grand Slam winner Steffi Graf in 1999. ""I've been working so hard, I really wanted it,"" she said in a post-match interview. ""She was playing well and I got a little tight in the second set. I was looking too far in the future. I was so close, but I can't do that. I was happy to get through that second set tie-break."" Williams will go into Saturday's final the favorite given her experience and her head-to-head record against Radwanska -- she hasn't dropped a set in their two meetings to date . Serena can now boast 85 aces in this year's tournament, second only to German quarterfinalist Philipp Kohlschreiber, who has 98 to his name. Williams' performance against Azarenka was made all the more impressive by the fact that she played two doubles matches with sister Serena on Wednesday. Radwanska won on her Grand Slam semifinal debut to become Poland's first major finalist for 75 years. The 23-year-old and German Kerber are firm friends off the court but Radwanska told reporters she had to put personal feelings aside in pursuit of her Grand Slam goal. ""I'm so happy, it's amazing. I played very good today,"" Radwanska said. ""It's always tough against Angie. We are very good friends but of course on court we were both fighting for the final. ""I think we were both a bit nervous in the beginning, your hand is shaking a bit, but after a couple of games I relaxed. ""This is what I dreamed of since I was a kid. Everyone wants to reach a Grand Slam final. It is the best two weeks of my career."" Kerber, who defeated her friend and fellow German Sabine Lisicki in the quarterfinal, said she had lost to the better player. ""She played very well today. I gave my best, but she was better,"" Kerber said. ""I was maybe one or two steps slower. I think that made the difference. ""My plan was to be aggressive, but she moved very well and didn't make many mistakes, so it was really tough. ""Actually it was a great tournament for me. I'm in the semis here in Wimbledon. Sure, I'm a little bit disappointed, but it's ok.""","Serena Williams will face Agnieszka Radwanska in the Wimbledon singles final .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese state media is dismissing reports that former President Jiang Zemin has died, calling them ""pure rumor."" Speculation swirled throughout the day Wednesday that the 84-year-old leader had passed away. On Thursday, the Xinhua news agency denied those reports, citing ""authoritative sources."" ""Recent reports of some overseas media organizations about Jiang Zemin's death from illness are pure rumor,"" the news agency said. When reporters asked the foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei about Jiang's health at a news conference Thursday, he directed them to the Xinhua report. ""Xinhua has sent out a relevant report. Please look up the report,"" he said. Pressed further, Hong added, ""Xinhua has made it clear. I have no more to add."" During his 13 years as general secretary of the Communist Party and nearly 10 years as president, Jiang mixed economic freedom and political control to move forward the so-called 'market socialism' introduced by his predecessor Deng Xiaoping. Under his leadership, China began to emerge as the world's fastest growing major economy. Jiang also saw the peaceful handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China and that of Macau from Portugal while repeatedly threatening to use military power against Taiwan if it declares independence.

"Wenzhou, China (CNN) -- Acknowledging strong public anger and skepticism over the government's handling of a deadly bullet train collision last weekend, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao Thursday promised a thorough investigation into the accident and its aftermath. Wen made the pledge on the crash site near Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province, where a bullet train was struck from behind Saturday night by another train, killing at least 40 people and injuring almost 200. ""Our investigation has to answer to the people,"" Wen said after laying a bouquet of flowers at a makeshift memorial on the scene. ""There will be a thorough probe into the accident, including all relevant aspects from equipment failures, management problems to manufacturing issues."" ""If corruption is found during the investigation, we will take it seriously and punish those responsible to the fullest extent of the law,"" he added. Earlier the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the Shanghai railway bureau as saying design flaws in the railway signal equipment led to Saturday's fatal collision. Before addressing reporters at the crash site, Wen met victims' families and visited injured passengers at a local hospital. He said the government must show compassion in dealing with people affected by the tragedy, reminding officials that ""money would not bring lost loved ones back."" State media Tuesday reported that local authorities would offer bonus money to victims' families who settle early with the government, which has capped the total compensation at 500,000 yuan (77,000 U.S. dollars). Local officials later denied the story amid fierce criticisms online. Chinese netizens have also been fuming over the railway ministry's decision to end search-and-rescue operation after less than six hours, and its move to crush and bury one of the six derailed train cars when the investigation had barely started. In a nod to such sentiment, Wen said railway officials owed the public an answer while stressing the importance of an open and transparent investigation. ""The key to the handling of the accident is whether we let people know the truth,"" he said. ""During the process, we should release information to the public timely and accurately."" Wen, China's third most senior official after President Hu Jintao and legislative chief Wu Bangguo, has long been the public face of the top leadership in times of disasters and tragedies. He made a point of explaining his uncharacteristic absence from the scene until five days after the crash, saying he had been sick and confined to a hospital bed for 11 days. Now the world's second-largest economy, and flush with cash, China has built the world's longest high-speed rail network -- boasting more than 8,300 kilometers (5,100 miles) of routes -- in a few short years. The government plans to pour over $400 billion into rail projects in the next five years and also wants to export its technologies to markets that include the United States. The massive investment and rapid construction have long raised public doubts on the new lines' safety and commercial viability, and last Saturday's accident has only bolstered critics' arguments. ""I think the bullet train system is not stable and may break down in extreme weather conditions,"" said Professor Zhao Jian, a transportation expert with Beijing Jiaotong University. ""The previous railway minister developed high-speed rail irrationally and unscientifically, and this accident was the consequence of that 'great leap forward' strategy."" Wen assured skeptics home and abroad that the government would learn its lessons and do its utmost to restore people's faith in China's high-speed rail. ""If safety is compromised, there is no credibility to speak of,"" he said. ""It is important that we integrate our effort in pursuing speed, quality, efficiency and safety with the understanding that safety always comes first.""","Premier promises thorough investigation .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray recorded a double triumph on Tuesday to book his place in the last eight at Wimbledon, over opponent Marin Cilic and the dismal weather in London. After a day punctuated by rain delays on Monday, Murray was able to wrap up a 7-5 6-2 6-3 victory with just one interruption before damp conditions halted the action on all but Centre Court. Murray will now face Spain's David Ferrer -- who knocked him out of the recent French Open -- after the Spaniard defeated Juan Del Potro, from Argentina, 6-3 6-2 6-3. British No. 1 Murray said he was relieved to finish his clash against Croatian Cilic after a frustrating Monday in which play was suspended with the score 7-5 3-1. There was criticism of the tournament's organizers after Murray's match wasn't switched to Centre Court, which has a retractable roof, but he told reporters: ""I honestly don't care which court I play on. ""It makes no difference but obviously every player would rather be on Centre Court because you know you are going to get your match in regardless of the weather. ""I don't think I deserve to play every match on Centre Court. It's just annoying when the weather is bad. ""I haven't always dealt with rain delays that well in the past, so it's good experience for me. Probably from now on I will play on Centre so it won't be a problem."" Ferrer, the No. 7 seed, breezed through his match on the sheltered showpiece court, defeating 2009 U.S. Open champion Del Potro in just under two hours. He told the ATP Tour's official website: ""Today was one of my best matches [on a grass] court. But I'm not sure if is my best or not. At Wimbledon, there is a lot of wind. ""On an indoor court, under a roof, it is easier for us to play. The ball does not move and this is more comfortable for us."" Murray and Ferrer were joined in the quarters by German pair Philipp Kohlschreiber and Florian Mayer. Mayer, the No. 31 seed, reached the last eight at Wimbledon for only the second time after he defeated Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-3 6-1 3-6 6-2. His reward for reaching his first quarterfinal in eight years is a tie with world No. 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic. ""It's an unbelievable feeling. Eight years ago I was here in the quarters, and now eight years later it's happened again. So it's a wonderful dream for me,"" Mayer told reporters. Kohlschreiber battled past U.S. qualifier Brian Baker 6-1 7-6 6-3 to make the last eight of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 33 attempts. The No. 27 seed will now play French No. 5 seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga after he recorded a 4-6 7-6 6-4 6-4 win over American No.10 Mardy Fish in another rain-hit match. ""I'm very, very happy,"" said Kohlschreiber. ""It's very tough to describe the real feelings. I'm very happy how I played. ""Also, lucky, at the end, with the weather, that I could finish my match.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer staged a remarkable fightback on Friday to reach the last 16 at Wimbledon and avoid following great rival Rafael Nadal in exiting the grass-court grand slam before the end of its first week. At two sets down against Julien Benneteau, Federer seemed set to suffer the same fate as Nadal -- who lost to little-known world No. 100 Lukas Rosol on Thursday. But the man who has won a record 16 grand slam titles showed on Centre Court that he will not give up on his bid to match Pete Sampras' leading seven London crowns. Benneteau, ranked 32nd, had beaten the Swiss superstar once in the last of their previous three meetings in 2009 -- and the big-serving Frenchman was up for the challenge again as he won the first set 6-4 and then took the second 7-3 in a tie-break. Federer had to come from two sets down in his first-round Wimbledon match in 2010, and he pulled off the feat for the eighth time in his career after winning the third set 6-2, leveling with a crucial 8-6 tie-breaker and then cruising 6-1 in the decider after his fellow 30-year-old called for treatment on a leg injury. ""It was a tight match and maybe I had a bit of luck on my side. It was tough and brutal. I fought until the end to stay alive,"" said Federer, who also retrieved a two-set deficit in his French Open quarterfinal against Juan Martin del Potro earlier this month. Federer will next take on another experienced opponent in Belgium's Xavier Malisse, a semifinalist at Wimbledon in 2002. The 31-year-old, who also reached the fourth round last year, progressed with an equally battling 1-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 4-6 6-3 victory against Spanish 17th seed Fernando Verdasco. Federer is moving towards a semifinal clash with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who had to come from a set down before beating Czech 28th seed Radek Stepanek earlier on Friday. ""I was a set down, but managed to make the crucial break in the opening game of the second set, and then I thought I played really well,"" the defending champion said after winning 4-6 6-2 6-2 6-2 in two hours and 48 minutes. He will next face fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki, who beat Argentine 15th seed Juan Monaco to reach the last 16 at Wimbledon for the first time and only the second at any of the four grand slams. If he beats Troicki, Djokovic will take on either French 18th seed Richard Gasquet or German No. 31 Florian Mayer. Federer faces a possible quarterfinal against Russian 26th seed Mikhail Youzhny or Uzbekistan's Denis Istomen. Youzhny ended the hopes of Djokovic's eighth-seeded compatriot Janko Tipsarevic, who was aiming to reach the fourth round for the first time since 2008 but went down 6-3 6-4 3-6 6-3. Istomen also won in four sets against Colombia's Alejandro Falla, who famously blew a two-set lead against Federer two years ago. The 26-year-old has reached the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time in his career. Milos Raonic has been tipped as Sampras' successor, but the big-serving Canadian bowed out of the tournament after losing 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (10-8) 6-4 to unseeded American Sam Querrey in their delayed second-round match. Querrey, who reached the fourth round in his last appearance in 2010, will play Croatia's Marin Cilic for a place in the last 16 on Saturday.","World No. 3 Roger Federer survives big scare against Julien Benneteau at Wimbledon .

"(CNN)  -- The images coming out of Haiti since a devastating earthquake rocked the country almost a year ago show death, disease and political uncertainty. Yet these images don't portray the whole story. Ten-year-old Andrise, who lost her relatives and home in the quake, recently returned to school, proudly wearing her new pink uniform. She boasts to Save the Children staff that she is one of the best students in class. She dreams of becoming a doctor. Andrise is one example of what is possible for children who live in a country that for decades has been mired in poverty and corruption. Today, Haiti is at a crossroads and the future of these children will be determined by their families, countrymen, newly elected government, and, the international community. Will we limit relief efforts to achieve no more than a return to the status quo, or will we make children like Andrise the priority -- and transform tragedy into sustainable progress led by Haitians? Clearly, the latter is the only way to realize the promise of Haiti's next generation. I urge Haiti -- with support of the international community -- to achieve a prompt, fair and credible resolution of the election. This would guarantee that lifesaving cholera work can continue uninterrupted  so the newly elected government will provide the leadership so Haiti can take advantage of a constellation of factors that hold potential for success. These include: . -- the opportunities presented by unprecedented attention, resources and international partnerships focused on Haiti, . -- the incredible resiliency of the Haitian people who prefer a hand up to a handout, . -- the resourcefulness of Haitians living abroad who are committed to Haiti's future, . -- Haiti's proximity to the United States, which has a strong national interest in seeing the country progress. As its next-door neighbor, the United States must assist the Haitian people in their quest to build back. Congress and the Obama administration need to make a 15-year commitment to Haiti that will help create sustainable development to improve the health, education and economic opportunities of children and families. The United States must also work with other donors to treat those who are suffering from cholera and invest in water and sanitation programs that will eliminate the conditions in which cholera thrives. A long-term investment is not only the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do. A Haiti that is not developed is far more costly to the U.S. than one that is economically and politically secure. Investing in a more resilient Haiti now will yield significant return. It will cost far less than a continuing cycle of poverty, disaster recovery, and instability which U.S. interests in our hemisphere will require us to address when they reach an emergency level. With the right commitments by Haitian and international leadership, Andrise has a chance to become a doctor. Her mother has a chance to be trained in a profession that will contribute to the economic growth of their community and country. Their family can someday move from a camp to a house that is accessible to health care services, schools and jobs. Small steps can create a ripple effect and lead to big, positive and lasting changes. One only needs to look across the border to the Dominican Republic to see how long-term U.S. investments have contributed to a strong stable government and economy. Forty years ago, the Dominican Republic had some areas that were as undeveloped as Haiti. Today, it has hospitals, universities and a thriving tourism industry. Haiti has the potential to move in this direction. Already Haiti has seen progress since the earthquake, albeit at a much slower pace than many of us would like, given the obstacles it faced before and after the earthquake. Nevertheless, gains are being made. Despite the untenable living conditions and lack of jobs and basic services, many children are back in school. Many families living in camps now have access to clean water, which they did not have before the earthquake. Pregnant and new mothers who never had access to health facilities are seeing doctors, nurses and midwives. Most of this success can be attributed to the generous outpouring from the international community in the immediate aftermath of the quake and to many of the Haitians in the United States and Canada who have returned to help create a better future for their homeland. We should not give up on the opportunity to make Haiti better. With coordinated leadership from the government of Haiti, backed by perseverance and leadership from the United States and international community, Haiti can help ensure Andrise -- and all the children of Haiti -- have the chance to realize their full potential so that they and their country may prosper. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Charles MacCormack.","Charles MacCormack: Haiti must resolve election stalemate so it moves forward from solid base .
Success stories, he says, like schoolgirl Andrise's, show Haiti could rebound better than ever .
MacCormack:  U.S. needs to commit 15 years to help improve sanitation, health, education .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Madeleine Peyroux has carved out a successful career as an interpreter of songs from greats such as Billie Holiday, Patsy Cline and Leonard Cohen. But on her fourth album, the smoky-voiced singer holds the mirror up to herself. Madeleine Peyroux takes a clear-eyed look at her life and relationships on ""Bare Bones."" ""Bare Bones"" is Peyroux's first album for which she wrote or co-wrote all the tracks. And she doesn't shy away from touchy subjects. ""River of Tears"" was inspired by her difficult relationship with her late alcoholic father. ""I think it's the kind of feeling that you can get any time of your life when you just have to face some things,"" she says about getting personal. ""You have to let it all hang out, let go of the ideas that were more comfortable and embrace some of the sadness in your life. And then perhaps let it float.""  Watch Peyroux get personal » . Born in Athens, Georgia, Peyroux (pronounced ""Peru"") spent some time in a domestic violence shelter as a child. After her parents' divorce, she moved to Paris with her mother which is where, as a teenager, she tested her mettle as a performer by busking on the streets. Critics responded favorably to Peyroux's 1996 debut album, ""Dreamland,"" and international recognition followed with 2004's million-selling ""Careless Love."" While Peyroux prefers to keep a fairly low profile, she took the time to talk to CNN about stripping down to the bare bones on her newest album. CNN: This is the first album where you've written or co-written all the material. What was that like? Madeleine Peyroux: I was just excited about it. Every day was another opportunity to keep writing for this record, so I spent a year and a half co-writing with a lot of other people as well so that I could go through different processes and get the songs written. Now I'm singing these songs and I feel that looking back ... it was time really well spent. CNN: Was there apprehension about revealing too much about yourself? Peyroux: No. I think of the things that I wrote on this record as stories of being a young woman walking the streets of Paris late at night in ""Our Lady of Pigalle,"" or trying to touch on the Southern culture of drinking and surviving on the basic sayings that we have in order to understand what life is all about. ... But the question was ... would anybody want me to actually tell the full story from beginning to end and make sense of it? Because in the end, I'd like these songs to make sense to everyone and not just be my story. CNN: Tell us about the song ""River of Tears."" Peyroux: My producer, Larry Klein, had the idea. He wrote the lyrics at the beginning of the song because he had been working with me during the time my father passed away and he knew the story. ... He wrote, ""Stop all this talk, turn off the telephone. Open up another bottle. I'm gonna float down this river of tears."" We kept writing it together. CNN: What was your relationship like with your dad? Peyroux: Complex. ... He was a complex character. He's definitely a big part of the material on this record. CNN: The album ends on a very uplifting note with the song ""Something Grand"" and the line ""all's forgiven."" Is it true that song was inspired by President Obama? Peyroux: It was. ... I live in Brooklyn, New York, and I was up at 4 a.m., the quietest hour, where the highway just slows down for about five minutes so you don't hear any trucks banging over the potholes. I had the windows open. The debates [had been] on television. It was an exciting feeling, and we knew that there was a change coming. And I needed to know that in my bones, and I wanted to feel it. Luck would have it that Obama was elected the day that I recorded the vocals on that song. CNN: What is it about early female blues singers that captivate you? Peyroux: I think I was probably an early teenager when I discovered Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and a bunch of people that are on a long list of artists. They were important to me, especially as an early adolescent. ... To have a female role model that first of all touches me personally and deeply. ... They were very strong women. Bessie Smith, for example, created her own life. She ran the show, she owned a railway train. CNN: You've had a tough life so far, haven't you? Peyroux: Tumultuous. I think eventful ... with traveling and going through a lot of changes in my household, my family, moving around quite a bit. But [I've had] a lot of luck, you know. So not as tough as just a little crazy. ... Music was a big part of [my luck]. And it has the power to change a lot of people from being jaded and take them back into something soothing and healing.","Madeleine Peyroux's new album, ""Bare Bones,"" is unflinching .

"London (CNN) -- Never before in Britain has it been so fashionable -- and financially smart -- to fly the flag. Big business has long been aware of the economic benefits the nation's symbol of unity can bring. More than a decade ago British Airways and Virgin Atlantic fought over the use of the country's colors on their livery. And now small firms are making it big themselves on a seemingly insatiable demand for all things emblazoned with the Union Jack. First flown in 1606, to mark James I's union of Scotland with England and Wales, the asymmetrical banner is technically called the ""Union Flag"" when flown on land, though most know it best by its seafaring name the ""Union Jack."" No royalties, but royal riches . The flag has been present in its current form since 1801, when the Cross of St Patrick was added to the original design in recognition of the Act of Union with Ireland. And because the flag isn't licensed, anyone can print their own patriotic paraphernalia without having to pay any royalties. The recent flurry of royal events -- from Prince William's wedding to Catherine Middleton last year to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee this weekend -- has helped Britons regain a love for their national emblem. With the London Olympic Games also in the mix, the ""jubilympics"" has amplified a sustained appetite for Union Jacks. Fashions and treats fit for a Queen . Socks and slippers... ties and tea cosies . The red, white and blue standard adorns a myriad of products. It can be found on socks and shoes, ties and teapots -- at both ends of the price spectrum. That's welcome news to traders in a country contending with its first double dip recession since the 1970s -- which was, coincidentally, when the Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee. But Britain's famous flag has had a chequered past, and wasn't always so coveted. Once seen as a stuffy symbol of Imperial nostalgia, it was hijacked by the far-right, leading to false accusations of nationalism for purveyors of Union Jack products. Adrian Waistle founded Lancashire-based Proud to be British in 1997, and says customers initially assumed he was affiliated with the far-right British National Party (BNP). Turn the clocks to 2012 and business is booming. ""What can I say? It's party time and we are run off our feet,"" he told CNN. Waistle says orders are ""three to four times'"" higher now than during the Royal Wedding. He's already out of stock on the most popular goods. ""We've sold out of bunting and paper napkins, even the paper plates."" He adds: ""People keep calling up and asking for them though."" While most companies are cutting staff, Waistle plans to recruit a full-time tech specialist to help with the pick up in traffic on his websites, including www.unionjack.co.uk. Cool Britannia . Overlooking London's iconic Piccadilly Circus, the souvenir shop Cool Britannia takes its name from former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair's 1997 national rebranding exercise. As you would imagine, its shelves are brimming with British bargains. Phil Dowsing, Cool Britannia's Union Jack-dressed mascot, says sales are up at least 20% on last year, across the chain's three West End stores. ""The most popular items are the mugs, pens, key rings. They just can't seem to get enough of them,"" he says. Dowsing also describes sales as ""much busier"" than during the Royal Wedding. But you don't have to come from the United Kingdom to want a piece of the Union Jack. Britain's continental cousins may have flown the flag upside down on the day the country joined the European Union but now they wear it the right way up with pride. Peering up at 147, 12 foot-high flags adorning London's shopping district, Brenda Tode shows off her new Union Jack top to classmates on a school trip from Berlin. ""Look it matches!"" she says. Tode says she likes wearing the Union Jack ""because it's cool, because this country is cool!"" She continues: ""I don't care if it's not my flag. I like it."" Not made in Britain . Nick Groom, professor of English at Exeter University is something of an expert on the symbolism behind Great Britain's gonfalon. And having just released an authoritative biography of the Union Jack, one would imagine Groom is set to make a pretty penny himself. ""The Union Jack is so ubiquitous now it's almost invisible,"" he says. ""Personally, I've been struck by the recent enthusiasm for it. It has far outstripped what I could have expected."" Groom adds: ""I bet half of the people buying Union Jacks don't really know the full history and what it means."" Waistle points out another irony. ""Yes they represent the best of British and they are selling like crazy here,"" he says. ""But I'd bet most of the flags on the market aren't made here ... I hear 99% of them come from China.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For someone who claims to be incredibly laid back, Jason Mraz is certainly piling up the accomplishments. Jason Mraz was recently honored with a songwriting award for his work, which includes the hit ""I'm Yours."" The singer-songwriter was the recipient of the Hal David Starlight Award at last week's Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee ceremony in New York. The honor typically goes to newcomers striking a chord in the music industry. Or, as Mraz puts it, ""I hope it has something to do with their savvy freshness."" Mraz, who turned 32 this week and took his parents to the celebratory dinner at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square June 18, says he feels great about the honor. ""I never thought my songs would escape my bedroom,"" he said. ""To have the music shared all around the world, and to be acknowledged by communities like this ... it's inspiring."" Mraz's 2008 album ""We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things"" has been a runaway success, with more than 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. It also led to three Grammy nominations, including song of the year and best male pop vocal performance for the reggae-inflected hit ""I'm Yours."" Mraz (whose name reflects his family's Czech heritage) hits the festival circuit overseas before kicking off his stateside ""Gratitude Café Tour"" July 25. The tour's quirky title was inspired by a wholesome San Francisco, California, restaurant Mraz loves. A fan of maintaining a diet of predominantly raw foods, Mraz is also a farmer of sorts: He owns an avocado farm in his home city of San Diego, California. He's also a juggler, a skill Mraz taught himself during the downtime that comes with touring.  Watch the multitalented Mraz perform » . Mraz shared tales of his avocado farm, as well as what it's like to get the cold shoulder from Simon Cowell, when he sat down with CNN recently. CNN: So, you live on an avocado farm. What's that like? Jason Mraz: It's fantastic. Anytime you're harvesting something in your yard -- whether you have a small herb garden or I've got avocados, and now we have a solar system so we're also harvesting sun energy, which is great -- for me that's when I became an environmentalist. I was like, ""Wait a second. This is my environment. This is my piece of the Earth that I'm responsible for."" Yes, the trees give me avocado and fruit that we sell and we eat tons of, but I feel like I have a role to play back to that, too. So it's cool. CNN: So if you're at home, daily how many avocados would you eat? Mraz: At least two. Sometimes three or four. CNN: So you must have very nice oily skin. Mraz: I do, thank you. It's the avocado. I just lather it on. CNN: Do you really? Mraz: I do. Yeah, why not? I've got tons of them! CNN: Do you cook? Mraz: I prepare. There's not much cooking in our household. We do a lot of raw food so it's more about putting the right ingredients together to create something scrumptious. See Mraz's chocomole recipe . CNN: When eating healthy is so important to you, how difficult is that to maintain when you're traveling around the world so much? Mraz: Well, I bring tons of backup supplies with me. CNN: How did you like performing on the ""American Idol"" final? (Mraz performed ""I'm Yours"" with contestants Anoop Desai and Alexis Grace.) Mraz: I loved it. It was such a great event. And I have compassion for every one of those kids that dares audition. I wasn't a contestant. I was just there to sing, and when I saw Simon at the end of that panel I freaked out. I was like, ""What does he think?"" And then I had to stop myself and say ""Dude, you're not a contestant."" He's aloof. But I watched during the rest of the night and he did it to all the acts. That's just his way. CNN: Do you think you could hack it as an ""American Idol"" contestant? Mraz: It is really tough. I watch what those guys do backstage between songs and their weekly schedule is super intense -- to learn new songs, to shoot videos, to learn dance moves and all this. They actually go through a pretty amazing transformation during the course of that show. I just don't know that I could commit myself to something like that. I'm a little more laid back. And some days if I can't show up to work, I don't show up to work. And I love that (laughs). CNN: Were you surprised by the success of ""I'm Yours""? Mraz: Very surprised. There's something simple about it ... like a nursery rhyme. I thought it was so playful. I never expected the world to really grab it and run with it the way they have. CNN: Can you talk me through how you went about writing that song? Where were you? What were you doing? Mraz: I was at home. It was a sunny afternoon. And just as any afternoon where I play music, I was playing on an electric guitar, just chugging around, feeling a little reggae in me you know, and the melody and the words just started to pop out rather quickly and so I recorded it rather quickly. And the whole process only took about a half an hour. CNN: You're about to go overseas to play various festivals. Is there anywhere you'll be going for the first time? Mraz: This year we're going to explore South America, which I've visited as a tourist, but I've never taken my music down there. I hear the crowds turn up in masses, so I really want to see what that's like. I love getting to bounce around and explore so much. I love Scandinavia. I love Spain. It's so mystical and romantic, yet it's gritty. CNN: Do you speak Spanish? Mraz: No, but I have the Rosetta Stone. I have begun my level one training.","Jason Mraz recently honored with songwriters award .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- So far it has been a very sunny summer for newbie pop singer Kristinia DeBarge. Kristinia DeBarge has broken through with the summer hit ""Goodbye."" She has a Top 20 hit with ""Goodbye,"" a peppy pop number which borrows from Steam's 1969 stadium anthem ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye."" The energetic video just earned DeBarge an MTV Video Music Award nomination in the best choreography category. And later this month the 19-year-old will demonstrate her dance skills as the opening act for Britney Spears' global ""Circus"" tour. The L.A.-based singer is well connected in the music business: she's the daughter of James DeBarge, a member of the '80s R&B group DeBarge.  Her debut album, ""Exposed,"" dropped last week, and was produced by Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds.  Watch DeBarge tell her subject ""Goodbye"" » . Kristinia DeBarge (pronounced Kristi-NEE-ya) dropped in to CNN to talk about why her dad initially wanted her to follow a different career path, her different personalities and lip synching. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your dad must have a wealth of advice for you. Kristinia DeBarge: Yes he does. His advice is stay true to yourself. He's also told me many times that I should have a lot of strength in this business, and that I'm going to need my family around me. CNN: He didn't want you to go into music, did he? DeBarge: No, because he knows how the music industry is. And some people can become a little jaded and tainted after. So he likes that I'm innocent and wants to keep that innocence fresh. CNN: What did he want you to do? DeBarge: Something like be a doctor or a veterinarian or a lawyer. I totally admire all those jobs. ... But it's not my passion. My passion is singing, so if I was to do those things I wouldn't be happy because I'd be like, what a waste of talent. I'm a singer. CNN: You were on the ""American Idol"" spin-off show ""American Juniors"" in 2003. What was that experience like? DeBarge: I had a lot of fun. I met a lot of different people on the show who are pursuing not only music but acting and modeling and all that fun stuff. It was really cool to interact with the kids my age because we were all there inspiring each other. CNN: What do you like about working with Babyface? DeBarge: I like that he's so down to earth and he's open-minded. He's open-minded in the sense where he allows me to have a lot of input on my music. He allows me to write with him and then bring in other writers and other producers. ... He's like another dad to me. He's very protective and sweet. CNN: Whose idea was it to borrow from Steam? DeBarge: The producers and the songwriters. ... And I was like gosh, what a great idea. Maybe I could take over the old version that's playing at basketball games and the hockey games! Even for people who don't really like pop music ... they can listen to that song and sing along to it. CNN: Tell me a little bit about your album. DeBarge: I named it ""Exposed"" because I feel that in introducing myself to the world you're getting to know Kristinia from all angles. So you're going to get to know all different characteristics and personalities that she has. CNN: Does she have many personalities? DeBarge: Sometimes, but they're good. They're good personalities. She's just like everyone else. And that's also something that I want to make clear on the album -- that I'm very normal and I experience all of the same things that 19-year-old girls go through. ...  It's my first album and I'm hoping that everyone from little girls to older women will really be able to relate to it. CNN: Are you excited about being one of the opening acts for Britney Spears? DeBarge: Yes, I'm really excited about that. ... She's a great performer and entertainer and I think that she has so many fans and so to gain her fans is going to be great for me. And I mean the fact that she even approved of it is great. CNN: What are your thoughts on lip-syncing? DeBarge: I would say that I understand it, but if you're a vocalist it's good to sing. ... I love to perform. I also like to sing. [When I performed on] ""So You Think You Can Dance"" I sang and I was dancing, so a lot of people were like ""Is she lip-syncing?"" But I was really just singing as well. It's really hard to do. People think it's a lot easier than it is.","Kristinia DeBarge has a hit with ""Goodbye,"" borrowed from '69 Steam hit .

"(CNN) -- A worrying back problem and the damp British weather were not enough to stop Roger Federer marching into a 33rd successive grand slam quarterfinal on Monday. The 16-time major winner kept alive his hopes of joining Pete Sampras on seven Wimbledon successes after beating another tennis veteran Xavier Malisse 7-6 (7-1) 6-1 4-6 6-3 for the 850th victory of his illustrious career. Federer, who had to come from two sets down to defeat fellow 30-year-old Julien Benneteau on Friday, needed to call for a medical timeout to receive painkillers at 4-3 up in the opener. ""I was in a lot of pain. The treatment and the painkillers worked. I started to feel better as the match went on,"" said the Swiss, who will next play another 30-year-old, Russian 26th seed Mikhail Youzhny. ""It was a shock for it to happen in the first set of a grand slam when you have to play five on grass. I thought I was in big trouble at 5-6 and he was serving for the first set. I apologized to Xavier for having to go off, but it was just a freak thing."" The cool, wet conditions didn't help Federer's back, but he said he was glad that the Centre Court roof was not closed before he completed his win over the Belgian. ""I was happy they kept it open because it is an outdoor tournament at the end of the day. We don't want to play indoors all the time,"" he said after extending his record against 2002 semifinalist Malisse to 10-1. ""It's not that big of a deal coming on and off.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Friends, family members and fellow dissidents on Tuesday buried Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas, a prominent critic of Cuba's socialist government. Dissident organizations reported that dozens of anti-government activists were arrested as they made their way to Paya's funeral. Video showed police pushing several dissidents into buses. The Cuban government Tuesday did not immediately respond to CNN's inquiries regarding the arrests. Payá, 60, and another dissident Harold Cepero Escalante died Sunday after the car they were traveling in crashed near La Gavina, Cuba. Two other men in the car, Spanish politician Angel Carromero and Swedish politician Aron Modig, survived and were released from the hospital on Monday. Carromero was behind the wheel when the rental car crashed said Francisco de Borja Morate Martín, a counselor in the Spanish Embassy in Havana. ""He is very shaken psychologically,"" he said. The diplomat said that on Tuesday Carromero was, for a second day, speaking to Cuban police and was being assisted by Spain's consul to Cuba. Carromero's testimony could be key to determining how Payá, one of Cuba's best known dissidents, died. On Sunday, family members told CNN that the car he was had been run off the road by another, apparently on purpose. Details of deadly crash disputed . But a statement released by the Cuban government on Sunday said witnesses to the crash reported the car had lost control on its own and crashed into a tree. Oswaldo Payá was a long standing thorn in the side of Cuba's government, which considers dissidents to be paid mercenaries who have betrayed their own country. In 2003, Payá received the European Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom of expression. The award is named for Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and is awarded to those who work to promote human rights and democracy. The Varela Project, a signature drive led by Payá, delivered thousands of signed petitions asking for changes to Cuba's political system. The initiative was largely ignored by Cuba's leaders, but former President Jimmy Carter highlighted Payá's work during his trip to Cuba, the first made by a former U.S. president to Cuba since the 1959 revolution. Amid the questions that swirl around Payá's death, some of his fellow dissidents called for an end to the conspiracy theories and for a transparent investigation into how he died. ""He tried to carry out reform in a nonviolent way,"" said fellow dissident Elizardo Sanchez. ""It turns out that he died in a violent way; an absurd and strange accident."" According to a government statement, Cuban police are investigating the circumstances of Paya's death.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has been charged with improper conduct by the English Football Association. The former national team captain responded to a tweet describing Chelsea and England left-back as a ""choc ice"" with the message: ""I hear you fella! Choc ice is a classic! Hahahahahaha!!"" In a brief statement published on their website Thursday, the FA announced: . ""The allegation is that the player acted in a way which was improper and/or bought the game into disrepute by making comments which included a reference to ethnic origin and/or color and/or race."" Ferdinand, a surprise exclusion from England's Euro 2012 squad, has until 4pm on 2nd August to respond to the FA's charge. The charge is the latest twist in an ongoing saga that began last October, when England and Chelsea defender John Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, Rio's brother, during a Premier League game. Terry was recently found not guilty at Westminster Magistrates Court, but has since been charged by the FA for alleged ""abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards"", and an allegation ""that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or color and/or race of Anton Ferdinand."" Ashley Cole, who plays alongside Terry for club and country, was a character witness at the court hearing. The elder Ferdinand controversially tweeted during the trial, ""Film of the day: Liar Liar....starring Jim Carey. What a film!!"", in what many assumed was a coded reference to his former international teammate John Terry. Meanwhile, Manchester United has announced that car maker Chevrolet will be the club's new shirt sponsor. The seven year deal will run from the 2014/2015 season, with the U.S. based company becoming only the fifth shirt sponsor in the club's 134 year history. United' commercial director Richard Arnold described it as a ""fantastic, long-term deal for the club"", but declined to reveal how much the new deal was worth to the club.","Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand charged by FA for comments posted on Twitter .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- While shoulder pads and big hair are no longer part of the Bangles' repertoire, those glorious harmonies remain. The Bangles just started on a new CD and have stayed active by touring. The '80s band (whose members aren't entirely sold on that description) recently powered through a set at Sirus XM Radio's New York headquarters as part of the company's ""Artist Confidential"" series. An audience of happy fans watched from outside a studio as Susanna Hoffs and sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson attempted to rattle the glass walls with the melodious ""Manic Monday"" and an electric ""Hazy Shade of Winter."" The Bangles broke up at the end of the decade, after also having hits with ""Eternal Flame"" and ""Walk Like an Egyptian,"" but re-formed in 2000. In 2003, they released the album ""Doll Revolution."" They've just started on a new CD. These days, there are only three members; bassist Michael Steele left the group in 2005.  Watch the group draw the line at walking like an Egyptian » . Hoffs, now 50 but looking nowhere near it, celebrates the release of a side project next month: a collection of '70s covers with musician Matthew Sweet called ""Under The Covers Vol. 2."" The Bangles talked to CNN about fine wine, being horrified by the decade that made them and stumbling across embarrassing photos on the Web. CNN: What's it like performing together now? Is it easier or more enjoyable than it was in the '80s? Susanna Hoffs: For me, it is. One nice thing about getting older is that we're better musicians, and we play better. Vicki Peterson: And slightly more relaxed as humans. And maybe we have a little more perspective. Hoffs: That fine wine mellowing. (It) has happened to us as well. Vicki Peterson: Yes, the drinking of the fine wine, not the being of the fine wine. Debbi Peterson: We've mellowed out, man. CNN: Well, that's kind of boring, isn't it? Hoffs: Don't worry. We still have our edgy moments. CNN: Now that you all have families, how do you juggle recording an album and going on the road? Hoffs: There's a lot of text messaging. It's mostly scheduling. It's crazy how busy we are. But it's OK. It's just juggling. It's like any working mother. CNN: How's the new album coming along? Vicki Peterson: We just sort of started it, scratched the surface. ... We've been having a good time, and we're experimenting with technology. Both Susanna and I have studios in our home, so that's going to open up our scheduling a little bit. We're also recording as we write, which we've never done before. So it's an interesting process. CNN: Do you have a deadline? Hoffs: No. No record label, no deadline. And that's kind of what's fun about it. Vicki Peterson: No one breathing down our necks. Hopefully we get it done. Because normally we need deadlines or we don't do anything. CNN: Why do you think people are still so fascinated with the '80s? Hoffs: I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Because during the '80s, we were sort of horrified by the '80s! No, not horrified ... but we were shocked by how silly a lot of it was. And kitsch. Debbi Peterson: And big hair. Vicki Peterson: And not in synch with our own time. Hoffs: We were little girls who grew up being obsessed with all things '60s, because to us, the '60s was like the Renaissance. It was like the golden age of culture, art and music, films and fashion. I think there's an aspect to the '80s that no matter what you think about it, it was just silly and fun and lighthearted. There wasn't a lot of protest music going on. There wasn't a lot of super-meaningful stuff, except there was great indie rock that came out of the '80s. It was just fun. CNN: But ultimately, you don't identify yourselves as an '80s band, do you? Vicki Peterson: No, we don't. Even in the '80s, we felt a little out of our element. Hoffs: And yet I wore the terrible shoulder pads. Debbi Peterson: We're all guilty of that one. Hoffs: Why did I do that? CNN: Do you often look back at old photos? Hoffs: The problem is the Internet. Everything's on there now. It's inescapable. Vicki Peterson: Everything lives forever. CNN: Do you self-Google just to torture yourselves? Debbi Peterson: Never. Vicki Peterson: (jokingly) That's a rather personal question, isn't it? Hoffs: I've been known to do it, just to kind of see what's out there, and it's a very dangerous, slippery slope. One should not do it too often. Vicki Peterson: I wouldn't recommend it. CNN: What do you think about social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and MySpace? Hoffs: I think if it's not twitter-lating, then one must not spend too much time doing it. Twittering. I can't go down that path yet. ... Vicki Peterson: Tweeting actually is the verb. One tweets. Hoffs: I know, but I've created the new ""twitter-lating."" It's my own personal statement on it. It's just too many things to keep track of. And it's too many things that are about the moment. Vicki Peterson: There's a complete lack of the inner critic, a complete lack of editing. Everything is out there all the time. There's no mystery. I don't think I want the world to know my innermost thoughts. CNN: Are there any girl bands out there that impress you? Vicki Peterson: It's a rare breed still for whatever reason. Antigone Rising opened for us here in New York. They were wonderful. Debbi Peterson: The Donnas. Hoffs: People don't realize how awesome it is and how fun it is, having the camaraderie with other women. Women get together and do other things. Why not play music together? There's a certain something about it that's very compelling. CNN: Take me back to the moment when you decided to reunite. Vicki Peterson: It was a long, drawn-out moment. It lasted about three years. Hoffs: I was the instigator. You guys would admit that, too. Vicki Peterson: Absolutely. At ever-increasingly close intervals, she would call. Eventually, we did all get on the phone together and decide that the idea was a good one. We were all making music with other people, and there is a certain magic to the Bangles when we sing together. Debbi Peterson: The voices. Vicki Peterson: And the writing. I missed the writing partnership.","The Bangles were '80s hitmakers with ""Walk Like an Egyptian,"" ""Eternal Flame""

"(CNN) -- The 1992 Barcelona Olympics mark the first games in which Team USA included NBA athletes. It was called the ""Dream Team."" The Dream Team comprised a coterie of NBA legends, including Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, and of course, ""His Airness"" Michael Jordan. Its claim to the title of best basketball team ever has remained virtually unchallenged for two decades. That is, until last week, when Lakers guard Kobe Bryant suggested this year's Olympic team, featuring himself along with NBA superstars LeBron James and Kevin Durant, could beat the heralded Dream Team. Suffice it to say, Bryant's assertion shook up the sports world. The vigorous responses on ESPN, talk radio and in cyberspace are fierce rebukes directed at the five-time champion for declaring what many commentators, bloggers and pundits deem blasphemous. Michael Jordan laughed when recalling Bryant's statement, telling reporters that his Dream Team was too smart and too good to lose to this current contingent of NBA youngsters. Similarly, Charles Barkley chided Bryant, arguing that Kevin, LeBron and Kobe are the only Team USA players good enough to have made the 1992 Dream Team roster. The general consensus appears to side with Jordan and Barkley. In informal online polls, an overwhelming majority of the public favored the Dream Team over our current Olympic Team in a hypothetical matchup. Judging by the polls, pundits and prognostications on the issue, few seem to be taking Kobe's sacrilege seriously. But I do. In fact, I believe Kobe Bryant's team would not only win, but also win comfortably. What makes this social scientist so sure? There is a general principle within elite performance systems, including everything from Scripps National Spelling Bee Championships to world-class modern dance companies, scientific research communities and professional sports. In competitive systems that offer participants great incentives, peak levels of performance progressively elevate. HLN: Kobe's right: Better Dream Team... '92 or '12? Simply put, spelling bee finalists, elite dancers, noted scientists, and superstar athletes get better and better over time. For example, Alvin Ailey, the founder of the prestigious Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and Judith Jamison, the dancing legend who elevated the company to world-class status, would not have been strong and athletic enough to secure spots in the same company if transported a few decades into the future while still in their primes. As decades passed, the physicality of the dancers in their company progressed far beyond Ailey's and Jamison's capabilities. The sports world is no different from the elite world of modern dance in that a whole lot can happen in just a few decades. Sports science advances, training regiments improve, coaching schemes gain sophistication, conditioning capabilities increase and practice procedures progress. As a result of these cumulative advances, athletes become bigger, stronger, faster and better. In 1972, Mark Spitz was the greatest swimmer in the world, winning seven gold medals in the Munich Olympics. But 20 years later, all of Spitz's record times were not just broken, but shattered. In fact, 1992 medalist Matt Biondi's best time in the 100-meters freestyle (long course) was almost three seconds faster than Spitz's 1972 mark of 51.2 seconds, a world of difference in the event. Biondi's record was broken by CÃ©sar Cielo from Brazil, who holds the long-course record with a time of 46.91 seconds. In figure skating, a quadruple jump, or toe loop, was inconceivable in the 1970s. By the 1988 World Championships, Canada's Kurt Browning landed the first valid quad toe loop. Twenty years after Browning's pioneer landing, the difficult move is part of the repertoires of most male Olympic figure skaters. Today's swimmers, sprinters, pole vaulters, shot putters, divers and long-jumpers are considerably better than their 1992 predecessors. Few, if any, athletic records last more than a decade before better athletes break them, and then in the next decade shatter them as a new breed of competitor emerges. Some records appear unbreakable in certain sports, but the progression in ability can explain why. Transport Steffi Graf from the 1990s into today's tennis circuit. Could her startling feat of maintaining World No. 1 ranking for 377 weeks happen today, when many more women detonate blistering service games, discharge powerful forehands and display dazzling speed and footwork? To put this into perspective, Graf's fastest serve was 112 mph. Venus Williams' fastest serve is 127 mph. Similarly, transport Joe DiMaggio a few decades into the future and his record 56-game hitting streak would have to be accomplished pitted against better defenses, fresh relief pitchers at the end of games, harder fastballs, slicker sliders and increased baseball knowledge. The possibility that Graf and DiMaggio's records may never be broken only speaks to how much competition in tennis and baseball has strengthened. Although swimmers and sprinters face no resistance beyond water and air, peak-performance feats in other sports must face strong defenses, which only improve as each sport gains sophistication. Wilt Chamberlain scoring 100 points in the era of Bill Russell is different from Chamberlain having a 100-point game in the era of Patrick Ewing, David Robinson and Shaquille O'Neal. Today's NFL safeties, linebackers and defensive ends are undoubtedly faster and stronger than their 1992 counterparts. Football's all-time leading wide-receiver Jerry Rice would struggle to get open for a pass when running routes against today's speedy cornerbacks, just as few NFL teams would draft Joe Namath and Roger Staubach if the two Hall of Fame quarterbacks were transported into the 1990s while in their primes. Transport any NBA legend 20 years into the future and he would have to compete against a new breed of athlete. Which means we can presume that: . Walt ""Clyde"" Frazier, Willis Reed and Phil Jackson, players on the 1973 Knicks championship team, would be too slow in their positions to help any NBA team win a championship in 1993. John Havlicek would not steal the ball in Game 7 of the 1985 Eastern Conference Championship like he did in 1965 because he is comfortably seated on the bench. Oscar Robertson in the 1960s is an indomitable force; the same Oscar Robertson in the 1980s would be a serviceable journeyman. Magic Johnson in his prime would be too slow to play point guard in today's locomotive landscape, just as Larry Bird would be too slow to guard any of today's elite small forwards. Can you imagine Magic chasing after Team USA's speedy guard Russell Westbrook, or Bird trying to contain Carmelo Anthony? It wouldn't be pretty. So there you have it. The new breed trumps the old. Today's Scripps National Spelling Bee winner would crush the 1992 winner in a spell-off. Today's Alvin Ailey dancers dance like superhumans compared with 1992 Ailey. Even today's competitive eaters vaporize hot dogs far faster than yesteryear's carnivores. This year, Joey Chestnut downed 68 hot dogs in 10 minutes, crushing Takeru Kobayashi's 2002 mark by almost 20 dogs, and two minutes faster at that. Transport this year's Team USA back to 1992 and the heralded Dream Team loses to Kobe's kinetic crew by a wide margin. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Shayne Lee.","Kobe Bryant suggests the 2012 Olympic basketball team would beat 1992's Dream Team .
Shayne Lee: It might be blasphemous, but Dream Team wouldn't beat today's players .
In elite performance systems, Lee says, players break records and get better each year .

"(CNN) -- The Williams sisters continued their march towards more Olympic success with three victories between them in London on Monday. Fourth seed Serena romped into the third round of the women's singles with a 6-2 6-3 win over Poland's Ursula Radwanska, whose older sister Agnieszka she beat to win her fifth Wimbledon title earlier this month. The American will next face Russian 13th seed Vera Zvonareva, who knocked out 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone. Zvonareva, the bronze medalist at Beijing four years ago, triumphed 6-3 6-3. ""It was tough conditions, a little windy. I'm glad I was able to pull through,"" said Williams, who faces a possible quarterfinal against former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki or Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova as she seeks the only major title missing from her collection. Her older sibling Venus, who is in the same half of the draw, bounced back from her early exits at the French Open and Wimbledon by thrashing Roland Garros runnerup Sara Errani 6-3 6-1 in her delayed first-round match. ""Another gold medal would be amazing,"" said the 32-year-old, who won the singles title in 2000 along with the doubles, which she and Serena won again in 2008. ""I can't even imagine the feeling, I think my head would be too big and no one would even like me anymore. I've got to get there first, I have two chances and I'll go for it."" Venus will next play Canada's Aleksandra Wozniak, who progressed into the second round by winning 6-2 6-1 against Marina Erakovic of New Zealand. If she wins that game, Williams will play either German seventh seed Angelique Kerber or Hungary's Timea Babos for a place in the quarterfinals. That could mean a last-eight clash with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, who survived a second-set scare to beat 79th-ranked Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu 6-1 3-6 6-1 in her opening match on Centre Court. The Belorussian, who lost to Serena in the Wimbledon semifinals, will next face Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of Spain. Serena and Venus also won their opening doubles match, beating Romania's Sorana Cirstea and Simona Halep 6-3 6-2 to set up a clash with Kerber and Sabine Lisicki. Lisicki also moved into round two of the singles, coming from behind to beat Tunisian teen Ons Jabeur -- ranked 297th -- and securing a match against Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova. The winner of that tie will likely face world No. 3 Maria Sharapova, who next plays Britain's Laura Robson. Former world No. 1s Kim Clijsters and Ana Ivanovic will meet in round three, while Czech sixth seed Petra Kvitova -- whose Wimbledon defense was ended by Serena Williams in the quarterfinals -- will take on Italy's Flavia Pennetta.","Serena and Venus Williams win their singles and doubles matches at the London Olympics at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is no longer officially considered one of golf's top 50 players, ending a streak that extended back 15 years. According to the official World Golf Ranking, the 35-year-old Woods entered the weekend as the sport's 50th best player. But he lost that standing when Louis Oosthuizen finished tied for fifth at this weekend's Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland, earning him a place in the standings and ousting Woods. The rankings are endorsed by Professional Golf Association tours in the United States, Europe, Australia, Asia and elsewhere, according to the World Golf Ranking website. An updated ranking comes out every Monday. The last time Woods was not among the top 50 was on October 13, 1996. Since then, he won 14 major championships -- a distinction used for the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA championship -- and, for much of the next 778 weeks, ranked as the game's best player. In recent years, Woods has been plagued by the fallout surrounding his infidelity and divorce from his wife as well as numerous injuries. His last tournament win was the Australian Masters in November 2009. His next competition will be this week at the Frys.com Open in Corde Valley, California. Despite his recent slump, American team captain Fred Couples chose Woods as one of his wild card picks for next month's Presidents Cup in Australia.

"(CNN) -- India suffered widespread power outages that plunged half the nation in darkness Tuesday, the second massive power failure in as many days. As many as 600 million people were hit by the blackout, disrupting transportation and business before power returned. The breakdown of the nation's power grid points to another global concern: The slowdown of developing economies. After the 2008-2009 financial crisis, growth of developing economies like India and China that pulled the world out of recession -- the first time a return to growth from a global recession wasn't led by the developed economies like the U.S., Japan and Europe. So in the face of the eurozone debt crisis and tepid growth in the U.S., the slowdown of the so-called BRIC economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- is a worrisome sign, said Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. ""What's going on is these countries ... is actually more important for the world than what's going on in the eurozone,"" O'Neill, who coined the BRIC term, told CNN's Richard Quest earlier this week. The reason? The developing world has been creating wealth at a faster pace that Europe and North America. Last year, the BRIC economies added $2.2 trillion in economic growth to the world economy -- the equivalent of Italy, the 8th largest economy in the world, O'Neill said. ""So it is quite disturbing that Brazil and India have slowed down so much, obviously there's this huge debate going on about China's slowdown,"" O'Neill said. ""What happens with these guys is a lot more important for all of us -- including, by the way, companies in Europe that are exporting to the world."" The two days of disruption in the third-largest Asian economy has raised questions about its investment in infrastructure. Traffic jams snarled roads as signals were out, and at least 300 trains were delayed. On Tuesday, as blackouts spread across the northern half of India, the Reserve Bank of India cut its forecast for India by nearly 1%, estimating 6.5% growth this year -- a far cry from 10.1% growth in 2010. Brazil only grew 2.7% in 2011, compared to 7.5% in 2010. And China targeted its 2012 growth at 7.5% -- the first time Beijing set its growth rate below 8% in eight years. As the Indian economy has grown, so has its energy appetite -- but as the blackouts show, demand is outstripping supply. ""India's economic growth, especially the growth of the middle class and industry, is placing on the power grid has outstripped India's ability to provide the infrastructure it needs,"" said Arun Sundararajan, professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ""While this is certainly a significant event it's not something that is completely unexpected at a transition time like this in the country."" To help build better energy infrastructure, the government needs to open up to more public-private partnerships in the power industry, as it did for its booming telecommunications industry, Sundararajan said. ""I think over the next decade the investments of the government and particularly the investments of the private sector will be a big part of the solution here,"" Sundararajan said. O'Neill says the nation needs to open up its economy to greater foreign investment. ""In India, frankly, they need to wake up and deliver some of the talk,"" he said. ""In India's case, conceptually, it's easy -- let foreign investors invest in important parts of their country and sectors. If they do that, then a lot of India's problems disappear in a heartbeat."" Not everyone is downbeat on India and the rest of the BRIC economies. ""In India, the average age of workers is 24 -- that's exactly where China was 20 years ago,"" said Chris Devonshire-Ellis, the founding partner of Dezan Shira & Associates in Beijing, which advises firms on foreign direct investments in Asian economies. ""India right now has an existing wealthy middle class of about 250 million, the same as China. ""The interesting thing about India is that you would go there to manufacture cheaply but also make inroads to the Indian market,"" Devonsire-Ellis said. Meanwhile, Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, says institutional investors worldwide still have a heavy appetite to invest in fast-growing, emerging markets. ""A lot of people ask me if China is going to have a hard or soft landing,"" Mobius said. ""And I say they are not landing. They're continuing to grow and they're growing at a pretty fast pace."" CNN's Richard Quest, Anna Coren, Harmeet Shah Singh and Patricia Wu contributed to this report .","The blackout that affected 600 million point to India's infrastructure problems .

"Washington (CNN) -- The FAA said Friday it is heightening scrutiny of American Airlines after the carrier had three landings go wrong in December. ""In situations where there may be several incidents involving a single carrier over a short period of time, FAA inspectors increase their oversight, which we're doing now,"" FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said. The review was prompted by the botched landings of three planes between December 13 and December 24. In the December 13 incident, an MD-80 landing at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina touched down and went off the left side of the runway. While trying to get back onto the runway, the plane's right wingtip touched the ground. On December 22, a Boeing 737 overran a runway amid heavy rain at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica, injuring 91 passengers. And on December 24, an MD-80 en route from Chicago, Illinois, struck a wingtip landing in Austin, Texas. Billy Sanez, a spokesman for American, told CNN Friday that the airline is cooperating with the investigation, which he said was routine in landing incidents. Lunsford said the review will help determine whether the botched landings ""might be indicative of a larger issue."" If so, he said ""the FAA communicates its findings to the air carrier and assists in the development of the appropriate corrective action.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An explosives-filled car slammed into a U.S. Consulate vehicle in the Pakistani city of Peshawar on Monday, authorities said. There was confusion about the extent and severity of injuries as a result of the blast. Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said ""two U.S. personnel and two Pakistani staff of the Consulate were injured and are receiving medical treatment."" No U.S. consular employees were killed, she said. She said U.S. authorities were ""seeking further information about other victims of this heinous act."" Nuland's statement followed an assertion by local Information Minister Iftikhar Hussain that two Americans had died in the blast. Pakistani police and health officials said two Pakistanis were killed and 25 people were wounded. Umar Riaz, a senior Peshawar police official, said the U.S. consular security detail surrounded the vehicle, which was severely damaged, and took away the people who'd been traveling in it. As a result, Riaz said, he had no information about the people who were in the consular vehicle. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the bomber was apparently targeting a U.S. Consulate van filled with both Americans and Pakistanis. ""Let me just very clearly condemn the attack on our consulate personnel in Peshawar, Pakistan. We pray for the safe recovery of both American and Pakistani victims and once again we deplore the cowardly act of suicide bombing and terrorism,"" she said. Clinton praised the response of Pakistani authorities, saying some of the injured were airlifted to hospitals in Islamabad. The attack took place in an area of the city where several international agencies have offices. In addition to the U.S. Consulate, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, is in the area. Peshawar is about 190 kilometers (120 miles) from the country's capital, Islamabad. In May 2011, a remote-controlled car bomb targeted a convoy of U.S. Consulate vehicles in Peshawar, killing one person and wounding 11. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. In April 2010, three explosions went off in rapid succession near the consulate. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital, is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. It was formerly known as North West Frontier province, a name assigned during British colonial rule. The ruling party changed the name to reflect the province's majority Pashtun population.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- The leader of Mexico's leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, announced Tuesday that he has asked Mexico's Federal Election Institute for a recount of the ballots cast in Sunday's presidential election. Lopez Obrador's demand came the day after he said the vote had been ""plagued by irregularities."" Election authorities have projected Lopez Obrador as the runner-up in the vote. Mexico's presumed president-elect, Enrique Peña Nieto, said Monday it was time for his country to leave behind the political rancor of campaign season. Political tensions flare after Mexican presidential vote . The Federal Election Institute, known by its Spanish acronym IFE, says it expects the final count results Sunday. That's when each of the approximately 143,000 polling stations are supposed to have finished counting votes and signed an ""act"" detailing the number of votes. Wednesday marks the beginning of the district count, in which each of the 300 electoral districts will scrutinize the acts. Ballots will be recounted in cases where: . -- The difference between the first and second place candidate is 1% or less; . -- The number of annulled votes is greater than the difference between the first and second place candidates. Ana Isabel Fuentes, international coordinator of information for IFE, said she expects the law to mandate recounts in 19 districts, representing about a third of the total ballots cast. Lopez Obrador must wait until Sunday to formally submit any application for a recount to the Federal Election Tribunal. Any candidate can challenge, but National Action Party candidate Josefina Vazquez Mota has already conceded. The PRD candidate's declarations echoed comments he made in 2006, when election authorities said the leftist candidate narrowly lost the presidential race to Felipe Calderon. Lopez Obrador claimed election fraud and never conceded, referring to himself afterward as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" At the time, his supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they staged sit-ins and blockades. In 2006, official results showed him losing by about 240,000 votes (or about 0.6%). He led marches and demonstrations and refused to concede; a partial recount was held. Felipe Calderon was not declared president-elect until two months after the July election. Lopez Obrador did not accept that decision. A brawl broke out in the legislature before Calderon was scheduled to take the oath on December 1; Calderon sneaked in and out a back door to take the oath and gave the traditional speech not in Congress, but at another location. On Monday, Lopez Obrador had called on his supporters to wait for the official results. The Federal Election Institute's verification of individual poll results begins Wednesday. But in an op-ed article published in Tuesday editions of The New York Times, Peña Nieto made it clear that he thinks the election is over and he has won. ""Achieving our country's full potential is my mission as Mexico's next president,"" he wrote. Earlier, Peña Nieto told CNN en Español he was ready to work across party lines to build a better Mexico. ""We have to be constructive and put aside our differences, which are only for competitions and electoral contests,"" Peña Nieto said Monday. ""Yesterday I indicated that (after) this tense and divisive atmosphere, which is natural in all democratic contests, we have to turn the page and move on to enter another chapter, another moment in our political lives, with a willingness and spirit that are constructive and purposeful."" A quick count based on samples from polling stations throughout the country gave Peña Nieto the lead, with between 37.93% and 38.55% of votes, the Federal Election Institute said late Sunday. On Monday, the presumed president-elect said he had been receiving congratulatory phone calls and messages from world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama. Peña Nieto said he was unfazed by the fact that more than 50% of Mexicans had not voted for him. Opinion: Is Peña Nieto good news for Mexico? ""We, fortunately, live in democratic conditions with three predominant political forces, and this makes it very hard for any party to have an absolute majority,"" he told CNN en Español. The projected victory for Peña Nieto marks a triumphant return to power for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which lost its grip on Mexico's presidency to the conservative National Action Party in 2000. The Federal Election Institute's projections raised two key questions rooted in Mexico's complicated political past: Has the PRI, a political party that critics accuse of being authoritarian and corrupt, changed its approach? And will supporters of Lopez Obrador protest election results as they have in the past? Peña Nieto said Sunday night that he was looking forward, not back. ""We are a new generation. There is no return to the past. My government will have its vision based in the future,"" he told reporters. On the local level, there may not be many differences between today's PRI and the political party that dominated Mexico for decades, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""What's changed on the national stage is that Mexican citizens have different expectations for their federal government that are going to force the PRI to govern in a different way than it did 20 years ago,"" he said. For much of the PRI's rule, the political party controlled not only the presidency, but also national and state legislatures and local governments across the country. Now, in the country's Senate, a preliminary tally Monday showed the PRI winning only 33 of 128 seats. In the House of Representatives, the PRI had secured more seats than any other party, according to the preliminary tally. But opposition parties combined held a majority of seats. ""Then, the PRI was really a party that included all of Mexico, that had a broad patronage network and tolerated little dissent outside of the party,"" Selee said. ""And the PRI today is going to have to deal with opposition parties that have tasted power, an active citizenry that expects to be involved in major policies decisions, and a very vigilant press that will report on everything that happens."" Weeks before Sunday's vote, criticisms of Peña Nieto and concerns about the PRI's possible return to power fueled a student movement that staged demonstrations throughout the country. On Monday, outraged students from the group marched in Mexico City. They carried signs that said, ""Mexico without PRI"" and ""Mexico voted, and Peña did not win."" Analysts: Mexican vote leaves more questions than it answers . But while critics slam Peña Nieto, the charismatic 45-year-old former governor galvanized fervent support among residents of his home state and party loyalists nationwide. The Consulta Mitofsky, GEA/ISA and Parametria firms said their exit poll results projected a win for Peña Nieto, with more than 40% of voters saying they cast ballots for the PRI candidate. Peña Nieto's campaign platform included plans to stop the rise in food prices, promote energy reform, give social security to all Mexicans and reduce violence nationwide. ""He is obviously prepared. There was obviously a dirty war against him,"" said Martha Rojas Ramos, 58, as she prepared to cast a ballot for Peña Nieto at a Mexico City elementary school on Sunday. Critics lamenting the possible return of the PRI to power aren't thinking straight, she said. ""That's all in the past,"" Rojas said. ""What's important is that he is young and has all the ability to represent us.""","Lopez Obrador also challenged the 2006 election results .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi authorities executed 21 people, including three women, after they were convicted of terrorism and spent months on death row, the nation's Ministry of Justice reported Tuesday. The prisoners were put to death on Monday in what appears to be the latest of several executions carried out by authorities in recent months, despite a United Nations call for restraint. Since November, nearly 90 people have been executed, according to the United Nations. Sixty-five of them were put to death in the first 40 days of 2012. ""Our main concern is what were these people actually convicted of?"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Terrorism does not tell us very much."" Stork also expressed concerns over the nation's judicial process. ""What kind of trial did these people receive?"" he asked. ""We have unfortunately lots of experience to indicate that trials are very problematic, particularly security related trials in terms of providing defendants with the legal counsel."" Earlier this year, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said she was shocked at reports of mass executions. ""Even if the most scrupulous fair trial standards were observed, this would be a terrifying number of executions to take place in a single day,"" Pillay said then. ""Most disturbingly, we do not have a single report of anyone on death row being pardoned, despite the fact there are well documented cases of confessions being extracted under duress,"" Pillay said. The ministry also announced that it released 625 inmates on Monday from detention facilities across Iraq, indicating that the prisoners had completed their sentences. Meanwhile on Tuesday, six Iraqi security force members were killed by gunmen in two shootings that targeted checkpoints. In the al-Wazirya neighborhood of northeastern Baghdad, gunmen shot dead two Iraqi soldiers, authorities said. Gunmen also attacked an army checkpoint in al-Mashahda, an area north of Baghdad, with small arms fire. Four Iraqi soldiers were killed.

"(CNN) -- The share price of Samsung Electronics dropped nearly 7.5% in trading Monday as investors had their first opportunity to react to the more than $1 billion decision against the Korean electronics giant by a California jury for infringing on Apple patents. Samsung dropped 6.3% at the open of South Korea's Kospi index and finished the day down 7.45%, after dropping as much as 7.7%. The tumble erased about $12 billion from the company's market value Monday. Samsung is planning to appeal Friday's decision of a U.S. federal jury which awarded Apple $1.05 billion for copying the look and feel of iPhones and iPad design. The jury rejected Samsung's counterclaims against Apple. A senior Samsung executive told the Korea Times the decision was ""absolutely the worst scenario for us"" as he was heading into an emergency meeting at the company's Seoul headquarters on Sunday. The decision could lead to the prohibition of sales in the U.S. of Samsung smarphones and computer tablets found to have violated Apple's patents. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for September 20. CNNMoney: What the Apple-Samsung verdict means for your smartphone . ""As far as the money damages are concerned, (Samsung) will make that up in the long run. The bigger issue at the moment them having to come up with new and unique designs appealing to the customer base,"" said Christopher Carani, chairman of the design rights committee of the American Bar Association. ""It will lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices,"" Samsung said in a written statement after Friday's decision. ""It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies."" Apple, meanwhile, praised the court for ""sending a loud and clear message that stealing isn't right."" ""The mountain of evidence presented during the trial showed that Samsung's copying went far deeper than even we knew,"" the company said in a statement. A nine-person jury spent just two and a half days puzzling out its final verdict, with weeks of notes and memories of testimony, 109 pages of jury instructions, and boxes of evidence including a collection of contested smartphones and tablets as their guide. The jury award shows the growing importance of design for electronics makers. In 2001, Apple and Samsung were awarded 10 and eight U.S. design patents, respectively. This year, Apple could have as many as 333 design patents approved, while Samsung could have as many as 500, Carani said. ""Central to the U.S. case and at its very core was design rights, the way things look, and that's really where the large amount of this billion-dollar damages judgment comes from,"" Carani said. The lawsuit is the largest yet in the ongoing worldwide patent brawl between the two companies, which itself is just one battle in Apple's war against Google's Android mobile operating system. On Friday, a South Korean court found that both parties had infringed on each other's patents, banning the sale of the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, two iPad models and Samsung's Galaxy S2. The Korean court ordered Apple to pay Samsung $35,000 and Samsung to pay Apple $22,000. CNN's Paula Hancocks, Heather Kelly, John D. Sutter and Dan Simon contributed to this report .","NEW The share price of Samsung Electronics dropped nearly 7.5% in trading Monday .

"(CNN) -- Gore Vidal was a man of immense literary talent, some of which he used well, some of which he wasted. His essays are widely thought to be his best work. Two of his historical novels, ""Burr"" and ""Julian"" are gems. The more widely read and prize-winning ""Lincoln"" ruffled Lincoln scholars and many Americans, who objected to Vidal's depiction of our 16th president as a ruthless proto-fascist intent on crushing the South and transforming the small government American republic into a version of Bismark's Germany. But Vidal loved to be a polemicist and he valued imagination and vision, especially his own, more than he valued fact. Indeed his great talent for satiric wit, which perhaps brought him more fame than either his writing or his brief political career, exhibited how much more he valued wit than truth. His death removes a man who loved his country so much that sometimes he hated it, and who loved no one, even himself. Love was not a feature of human life that he had much interest in or sympathy for. He was mainly preoccupied with power and justice in the individual life, in the community and in the historical perspective. He was not shy about saying that behind his icy exterior was an icy interior. Shy is the wrong word. He was not shy about anything. I got to know Gore Vidal quite well, up front and personal, his magnificent strengths and his appalling, almost other-worldly weaknesses. One day in the mid-1990s I got a call from Vidal's literary executor, asking if I would be interested in writing his biography. The idea excited me. All my biographical subjects had been long dead literary greats. Gore had looked at my bios of Dickens and Henry James. He liked the idea of being in such company. News: Gore Vidal, chronicler of American life and politics, dies . Still, I hesitated. Vidal had the reputation of being a man used to getting his way. What if he attempted to exercise control over the manuscript and to pressure me to write it to suit him? At my request and on the basis of a draft I provided, he wrote a letter stating that he would give me complete cooperation and not attempt at any stage to vet the manuscript. He would not see the book until it was published. As soon as we could clear our schedules, we began six months of intensive interviews at his home in Ravello and on the phone. He enjoyed fine dining and drinking, and he was disappointed that at the time I was a nondrinker. He made up for my abstinence, and the Gore who verged on alcoholism and who went to fat farms to work off dozens of pounds before doing a book tour called me at any hour, his speech slightly slurred, to make another point or simply to talk. Opinion: My friend, il maestro Gore Vidal . He was not a conversationalist. He was a magnificent monologist. With a deep, mellifluous voice, a sharp witty tongue and a wide range of anecdotes about himself and famous people he had known and knew, he commanded the stage. At his best he was riveting, though often with a touch of the pompous. For Gore, charm and charisma, like his voice, were tools in an arsenal. He had a deep, unquestioned faith in his ability to get his own way. Where he succeeded most was in his writing and his spontaneous interviews. In his attempt at a political career, pursuing the nomination of the Democratic party for the governorship of California in 1982, his tools failed him. Charm and charisma didn't work. He was too much the cultured patrician to be a viable candidate. There was no way he could be elected to high office. News: A dozen thoughts from Gore Vidal . He made another misjudgment when he moved to Italy in the late 1960s. He could never understand why Norman Mailer and Truman Capote had more presence on the American literary scene than he did. It was, I suggested, because he lived in Italy. In the pre-Skype days, that was like living on another planet. Americans want their writers to be in America. He preferred the attractions of Italy. Vidal also preferred to pay for sex. He met his long-time companion, Howard Austen, in a New York bath house. He later stated a number of times that they never had sex, which is why they could have such a long relationship. Vidal was vain and delighted in his physical good looks until he lost them. He loved to be photographed. Whatever room he walked into, he thought himself the most important man in the room. He sometimes was not, but he was usually the most interesting. Coldness, narcissism, pomposity, the preference for wit and personal vision above truth, his love of celebrity and celebrities -- all that fades away, as do the failings of the two writers he felt most competitive with and trashed often, Mailer and Capote. What remains is a large body of literary work: the insignificant but respectable work for stage, movies and television; the paranoid political fulminations of his later years; the wonderful variety of historical novels; the satiric novels about sex and religion, like ""Myra Breckinridge"" and ""Live from Golgotha;"" the imaginative and wicked fantasy novels like ""Duluth;"" and the wonderful collected essays that reveal a mastery of the essay tone that places him almost in the company of Montaigne and Emerson. In my own view, he should have stuck to literature, he should not have alienated so many people, he should have given higher value to truth than wit, and he should have found ways to value if not to love those who were ready to love him. In my case, the tiny affair was over when he called me, just before the biography was to go to press, and demanded to vet the manuscript as if the agreement we had put in writing did not exist. I was disappointed but not surprised. Most of his people relationships ended that way. But he did have and still has an ongoing significant relationship with literary history, and he deserves more than a footnote, or at least a very long footnote, in discussions of the American scene and American culture between 1960 and 1990. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fred Kaplan.","Fred Kaplan: Gore Vidal had huge literary talent, some well used, some wasted .
His satire showed how he prized wit, vision over truth, he says. He loved celebrity .

"(CNN) -- One of the victims Jerry Sandusky was convicted of sexually abusing has filed a lawsuit against Penn State University, accusing the school of concealing the abuse. Attorneys for the boy the grand jury identified as ""Victim 1"" filed the lawsuit Friday, claiming the university was more concerned with ""protecting the reputation and commercial viability of its football program"" than rooting out a sexual predator of children. It further accused ousted Penn State President Graham Spanier, head football coach Joe Paterno, and former administrators Tim Curley and Gary Schultz of knowing that ""Sandusky was a dangerous, sociopathic sexual predator who had previously raped, sodomized, and/or otherwise seriously harmed young boys on the Penn State campus, and who was substantially likely to continue to engage in similar conduct in the future.""

""President Erickson and the Board of Trustees have publicly emphasized that their goal is to find solutions that rest on the principle of justice for the victims."" Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at the university, was convicted in June of sexually abusing 10 boys over a 15-year period. He continues to maintain his innocence. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh released a 267-page university-funded report last month that blamed Spanier, Paterno, Curley and Schultz for taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. The report has been criticized for its limited scope: Neither graduate assistant Mike McQueary -- who reported seeing Sandusky abuse one boy -- nor Sandusky or Paterno, who died in January, were interviewed by Freeh's investigators. Spanier, Curley and Schultz could not be immediately reached for comment Saturday. Curley and Schultz still face felony perjury counts amid accusations of lying to a grand jury and failing to report suspected child abuse. They have pleaded not guilty. Attorneys for Spanier on Wednesday blasted the review, calling it a ""blundering, indefensible indictment"" and ""a flat-out distortion of facts"" that was ""infused with bias and innuendo.""","Attorneys for the boy the grand jury identified as ""Victim 1"" filed the lawsuit on Friday .

"(CNN) -- A New Orleans bartender who accused Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. of pushing her has dropped all charges against him, bar management said Wednesday. The unnamed female bartender told police Gooding stopped by the Old Absinthe House in the French Quarter in the early hours of Tuesday with a group of people. She said Gooding soon became angry with other patrons who recognized him and wanted to take pictures with him. The bartender told police she asked Gooding to calm down, at which point he allegedly pushed her away. Another employee called 911 and told Gooding to leave, and as he left, he pushed the bartender again, police said. Police said Gooding was presumed to be intoxicated, and a misdemeanor battery warrant was issued for his arrest. Gooding and his attorney met with police Wednesday and was given a court summons, police said, but later in the day the bar's management said the bartender chose to drop all charges. ""While we will continue to investigate this matter internally, we are hopeful that this will put an end to the matter and allow everyone to get back to enjoying all that our great city has to offer!"" a statement from the management read. Gooding is starring in the upcoming movie ""The Butler,"" filming in New Orleans. He won an Academy Award in 1997 for best supporting actor in the film ""Jerry Maguire"" and starred in this year's ""Red Tails,"" about the Tuskegee Airmen.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Leading Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya Sardinas was mourned Monday amid conflicting accounts of the car crash Sunday that took his life. ""Paya gave decades of his life to the nonviolent struggle for freedom and democratic reform in Cuba,"" read a statement issued by White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""He remained optimistic until the end that the country he loved would see a peaceful and democratic transition."" A devout Catholic, Paya, 60, headed the Christian Liberation Movement, which attempted to carry out political change in Cuba through non-violent means, often using the legal framework of Cuba's socialist system. On Monday, the state-run newspaper Granma featured a short item on the car crash that took Paya's life but did not detail who he was or his work as a leading critic of the island's leaders. The article's headline called the accident as ""regrettable."" Read more on the Cuban dissident arrested after testifying for senators . Anti-government activists rarely are reported on by Cuba's state-run media, except to call them ""traitors"" working in the employ of the U.S. government against their countrymen. According to a statement about the crash issued by the Cuban government late Sunday, the unidentified driver of the car lost control and struck a tree near the eastern Cuban city of Bayamo. On Sunday, Paya's daughter, Rosa Maria Paya, told CNN that her family believed a second car had struck the vehicle her father was traveling in, forcing it off the road. Cuban Harold Cepero also died from the crash. Two others were in the car, it said: Swedish citizen Aron Modig and Spaniard Angel Carromero, who suffered injuries from the impact. Carromero, a technical adviser to the city of Madrid, received a gash on his head but he and Modig had been released from the hospital in Bayamo, said Francisco de Borja Morate Martin, a counselor in the Spanish Embassy in Havana. Spain's consul to Cuba had traveled to Bayamo to assist Carromero, who was being interviewed by Cuban police, Morate said. It was not clear where the men where traveling when the crash took place. The two survivors' testimony could be key to understanding how the crash occurred. According to the Cuban government's statement, the crash is under investigation by police. In 2002, Paya delivered to Cuba's National Assembly petitions containing 11,020 signatures calling for democratic elections and freedom of speech. Paya called the proposal the Varela Project, in honor of a Cuban priest who had battled against Spanish colonial control of the island. The Varela Project did not lead to changes to Cuba's one-party system. Instead, the Cuban government responded with its own petition drive that permanently ratified the socialist nature of the island's government. During his 2002 visit to Cuba, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was permitted to speak on Cuban state television and mentioned the Varela Project, the first time that many Cubans had heard of Paya's efforts to change the country's political system. Memorial services were being planned for Paya in Havana, Miami and Madrid.","A White House statement honors Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya Sardinas .
