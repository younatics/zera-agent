"(CNN) -- Juventus took an important step towards retaining the Serie A title with a battling 1-1 draw at the Stadio San Paolo of nearest rivals Napoli Friday. Negotiating the testing away fixture with honors even left Juve six points clear of Napoli at the top with just 11 games remaining. The league leaders had to put an ugly pre-match incident behind them, with Italian news agency ANSA reporting that a window in their team bus was broken by a missile as they traveled to the ground. Nobody was injured in acts described on Italy's Sky TV by Juve general director Guiseppe Marotta as ""deplorable and with little to do with sport."" The game itself started at a frantic pace with the visitors taking the lead after just 10 minutes as Giorgio Chiellini headed home. He had been recalled to the starting line-up and connected with an Andrea Pirlo left wing cross to score. Juve might have added to their advantage while Napoli's leading scorer Edinson Cavani continued his lean spell -- failing to net in his last seven matches. However, Napoli did level just before the break as Gokhan Inler's fierce shot deflected past Gianluigi Buffon. The visiting keeper had to save smartly from Marek Hamsik at the start of the second half as Napoli pushed for the winner. Another Hamsik effort was parried out to Blerim Dzemaili, but the Swiss international wasted the chance. There was still time for Inler to test Buffon again, but Juventus hang on for a valuable draw. Antonio Conte's men will now look to secure their place in the quarterfinals of the Champions League, entertaining Scotland's Celtic in midweek and leading 3-1 from the first leg. But Conte played down premature talk of the Italian championship being wrapped up. ""The title is far away, we are six points in front which is a good advantage . ""But there are another 33 available and don't forget we still have to play Milan, Inter and Catania,"" he told AFP.","Juventus hold Napoli to a 1-1 draw at Stadio San Paolo .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini insisted his team won't give up the English Premier League title without a fight as their 2-0 win over European champions Chelsea Sunday saw them keep their slim hopes alive. Leaders and local rivals Manchester United had gone 15 points clear with a 2-0 win at bottom club Queens Park Rangers Saturday, but reigning champions City responded with a battling victory at the Etihad Stadium. And a defiant Mancini still has hopes of reeling in United after goals from Yaya Toure and Carlos Tevez saw off Chelsea. ""We can't think that it's finished with 11 games to go. It's not my mentality or my players' mentality and we need to play like today. Both goals were fantastic,"" he told Sky Sports. The game turned on an incident just after the break as Chelsea won a penalty when England goalkeeper Joe Hart brought down Demba Ba as he attempted to go round him. Hart escaped either a yellow or red card for his infringement then rubbed salt into Chelsea's wounds by saving the resulting penalty from Frank Lampard, denying the midfielder his 200th goal for the Blues. ""I think Joe is the best keeper in England and one of the best in Europe,"" said Mancini. City took the lead just after the hour mark as Toure received a fine pass from Spain star David Silva and scored with a low curling shot. With five minutes left, Silva and Sergio Aguero exchanged passes for Argentine ace Tevez to convert from the edge of the penalty area. The result has left City still 12 points adrift of United, while Chelsea have slipped up in the battle for Champions League spots and have just a two-point lead over fifth placed Arsenal. In Sunday's other EPL match, Newcastle pulled six points clear of the relegation zone with an emphatic 4-2 win over fellow strugglers Southampton. Meanwhile, the first major domestic trophy of the English season was claimed by Swansea as they beat minnows Bradford 5-0 in the final of the League Cup at Wembley Sunday. Fourth flight Bradford knocked out Wigan, Arsenal and Aston Villa in a remarkable run to the final, but found Michael Laudrup's men a hurdle too far. The writing was on the wall from the moment Nathan Dyer put Swansea ahead in the 16th minute after being played in by star striker Michu. Spanish star Michu grabbed the second with five minutes remaining of the first half before Dyer scored his second goal just after the break after being set up by Wayne Routledge. Bradford's sorry afternoon was complete when they had goalkeeper Matt Duke sent off for fouling Jonathan de Guzman, who got up to convert the penalty to make it 4-0. De Guzman completed the rout with an injury time fifth as his side clinched a Europa League place for next season.","Manchester City beat Chelsea 2-0 in the English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League is set to make history in August by becoming the first soccer league to introduce goal-line technology. Goal-line technology (GLT) was used for the first time at the Club World Cup in Japan and the EPL plans to have it in place for the 2013-14 season. ""We are in ongoing discussions with two potential providers with a view to having GLT installed for the start of the '13-14 season,"" EPL spokesman Dan Johnson told CNN. ""The system, whichever one we choose, has to be installed and in use in all grounds to satisfy integrity of competition issues."" However, the EPL's position on GLT is not mirrored throughout European football. UEFA, which runs European competitions such as the Champions League and the Europa League, is opposed to the use of technology, instead preferring to continue with the use of extra officials behind the goal. ""UEFA and its president have made it clear on several occasions that we would not introduce goal-line technology in our competitions as we are completely satisfied with the additional assistant referees,"" read a statement issued to CNN. Earlier this month, football's global governing body FIFA confirmed it will use GLT for June's Confederations Cup in Brazil. The competition acts as a warmup for the 2014 World Cup in the same country, during which FIFA also intends to use GLT. FIFA has so far granted four companies licenses to provide technology systems. British firm Hawk-Eye, which already provides services to tennis and cricket, and German company GoalRef were both granted permission by FIFA following successful trials last year. Both manufacturers had systems in place at December's Club World Cup in Japan. Two further German systems have been approved this week: Cairos, which uses magnetic fields; and GoalControl, which relies on 14 high speed cameras positioned around the pitch. A decision on which system will be used for the Confederations Cup will be made in early April. Meanwhile, the EPL's longest serving player, Manchester United veteran Ryan Giggs, has signed a new one-year contract on the eve of what could be the 1,000th game of his illustrious career. The 39-year-old, who made his United debut 1991, could achieve the landmark when Alex Ferguson's EPL leaders take on Norwich City at Old Trafford on Saturday. Giggs also collected 64 caps for Wales before retiring from international football in 2007 and played for the British Olympic team at London 2012. The midfielder has made more appearances for United than any other player and is the most decorated footballer in English soccer history. He has won 12 league titles, four FA Cups, the League Cup on four occasions and the Champions League in 1999 and 2008. """"I am feeling good, enjoying my football more than ever and, most importantly, I feel I am making a contribution to the team,"" Giggs told United's official website. ""This is an exciting team to be part of, with great team spirit, and we are again pushing for trophies as we head towards the business end of the season."" United will be looking to open up a 15-point lead over neighbors and reigning champions Manchester City when they entertain Norwich. City, currently second in the table, travel to relegation-threatened Aston Villa on Monday.","EPL plans to introduce goal-line technology in time for the start of 2013/14 season .

"(CNN) -- He only played for the last 14 minutes, but David Beckham typically was the center of attention as his eagerly awaited debut for Paris Saint Germain ended in a crucial victory for the French league leaders Sunday. PSG were leading third placed Marseille 1-0 in Le Classique at Parc des Princes when the former England captain came off the bench to a rapturous reception from the home supporters. Some neat early passes showed he has lost none of his ability and the best was reserved for the very last as in the first minute of injury time Beckham's neat chip over the top led to the clinching second for PSG. It found fellow substitute Jeremy Menez, whose cross was bundled home by PSG's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic for his 24th of the season. It was all captured by a special 'Beck Cam' which host broadcaster Canal Plus had deployed to follow every move of the 37-year-old football icon, such has been the level of interest since his transfer to France's Ligue 1 from MLS side LA Galaxy. Beckham had spent much of a freezing evening in Paris, shivering on the bench, while in the stands his pop star wife Victoria and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy awaited his arrival on the pitch. His former Real Madrid teammate and Brazil World Cup star Ronaldo was also honored ahead of kick off. In the 76th minute, with PSG having to fight hard to hold a lead given to them by an early own goal from Marseille defender Nicolas N'Koulou, coach Carlo Ancelotti finally threw him into the fray to replace Argentina's Javier Pastore. The match had been billed as a showdown between Beckham and fellow Englishman Joey Barton, who plays in midfield for Marseille. Barton, on loan from EPL side Queens Park Rangers, played the whole match and had some half chances to level while Beckham watched on. The timely victory left big-spending PSG three points clear at the top from Lyon, who had beaten Lorient earlier Sunday. Defeat left Marseille eight points adrift. Beckham, who has played for Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan and LA Galaxy during his glittering career, has signed a contract with the Parisian giants until the end of the season. He has donated his reported 800,000-euro ($1 million) monthly salary to a local children's charity. Meanwhile, AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli had a less fruitful evening in his first Milan derby match for three years. Balotelli, signed in the transfer window from Manchester City, missed a string of chances as his side were held 1-1 by his former side Inter, damaging their Serie A title hopes. Milan, boosted by their 2-0 midweek win over Barcelona in the Champions League, took a 21st minute lead through striker Stephan El Shaarawy. Balotelli had three clear chances to add to their lead in the San Siro before Inter midfielder Ezequiel Schelotto leveled in the 71st minute.","David Beckham makes debut for Paris Saint Germain .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy and Luke Donald look set to fight it out for the $8million prize at the World Tour Championship after finishing level at the top of the leaderboard Friday. The pair, who are joined on 11-under by Scotland's world No.189 Marc Warren, are in pole position after another impressive day on the Earth course. World no.1 McIlroy, who revealed that he had been suffering with the extreme heat, looked in top form with tennis ace girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki smiling on from the gallery. Top two dominate in Dubai . ""I didn't feel great last night, but I felt much better this morning and felt nearly 100 % on the golf course,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""I guess it's just us Irish and the skin just not used to this sort of sun. That's my excuse anyway. ""I played well. I continued to drive the ball really well and gave myself plenty of opportunities. It was a solid round and obviously, puts me in a good position going into the weekend. ""I am as motivated as I have been the whole year and I am not going to let it drop just for this week."" McIlroy clinches money list double . It was another successful day for Englishman Donald, who hit a bogey-free round of 68 with two birdies on either half of the course. ""I haven't dropped a shot in 36 holes, so that feels really good,"" he said. ""But it wasn't quite as good on the greens today...I had some opportunities on a few holes that I just misread."" While the world's top two have dominated, the emergence of Warren has come of something of a surprise, not least to the man himself. ""It was nice to be the Scot in that pack with the Englishman and the Northern Irishman,"" said Warren, who is ranked 55th in the Race to Dubai. ""It's great to be in contention with guys like that. I just looked at the leaderboard and kind of enjoyed it really. ""At the same time, I am just trying to stay patient and keep doing what I am doing. I am really looking forward to the weekend."" While the top three stole the headlines, it was Spain's Sergio Garcia who carded the round of the day after equalling the course record of eight-under 64. Elsewhere, South African pair Louis Oosthuizen (67) and Branden Grace (65) sit a shot off the lead with Masters champion Charl Schwartzel (67) and Scotsman Richie Ramsay (68) tied for sixth at nine-under par.","Rory McIlroy and Luke Donald lead the way after second day in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- A group of soccer stars have called for Israel to be stripped of hosting rights for a top European age-grade tournament next year following last month's bomb attacks on Gaza. 52 players, including Eden Hazard, Papiss Cisse and Demba Ba signed a petition which was posted on the website of former English Premier League and Spanish La Liga striker Fredi Kanoute. ""We, as European football players, express our solidarity with the people of Gaza who are living under siege and denied basic human dignity and freedom,"" the statement said. ""The latest Israeli bombardment of Gaza, resulting in the death of over a hundred civilians, was yet another stain on the world's conscience."" American soccer star playing for Palestine . It cited reports of a bomb attack by Israeli forces on a football stadium in Gaza on November 10, which killed four teenage players, and said that two players from the club Al Amari had been detained in Israel ""without charge or trial"" since February. ""It is unacceptable that children are killed while they play football. Israel hosting the UEFA Under-21 European Championship, in these circumstances, will be seen as a reward for actions that are contrary to sporting values,"" the statement said. CNN has found no evidence that anyone was killed while playing football. But on November 10 as reported by CNN, four Palestinians were killed when Israeli tank fire hit a building east of Gaza City where mourners were gathered for a funeral, according to Palestinian medical sources. Israel said militants were targeted at several sites after an Israeli Defense Patrol came under attack, wounding four soldiers. The statement on Kanoute's site adds: ""Despite the recent ceasefire, Palestinians are still forced to endure a desperate existence under occupation, they must be protected by the international community. All people have the right to a life of dignity, freedom and security. We hope that a just settlement will finally emerge."" Tel Aviv will host the European Under-21 Championship next June, when eight nations will compete in Israel. European football's governing body UEFA has already rejected calls to move the tournament from pro-Palestine groups including the disputed territory's football association. Refugee United: Palestinians debut at Homeless World Cup . ""UEFA is an apolitical organization and (Israel) earned the right to host this competition through a fair, democratic vote,"" UEFA president Michel Platini said in June. ""I am sure that it will be a beautiful celebration of football that, once again, will bring people together."" World football's governing body FIFA also says it does not interfere in countries' political affairs, but said it would help rebuild the stadium in Gaza -- as it did in 2006 following a similar attack. ""We see it our mandate to rebuild football infrastructure which has been destroyed,"" FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said last week. ""Football brings people together and we will support any reconstruction necessary when football infrastructure is destroyed through disasters."" Palestine: A national soccer team without a nation . Valcke's statement was criticized by Israeli media, which reported that the stadium was used by Hamas militants to fire rockets at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Palestine's bid for recognition was boosted last week when the U.N. general assembly voted to upgrade its status to that of a non-member observer state -- a move which was opposed by Israel and the U.S. ""We came to the United Nations not to confront the U.S. and not to isolate Israel or to discriminate Israel. We came to preserve the two-state solution,"" Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat told CNN's Piers Morgan.","Top footballers protesting against Israel hosting of tournament .

"(CNN) -- He might be counting the days until his departure from Stamford Bridge, but Chelsea manager Rafa Benitez continues to quietly polish his curriculum vitae for future employers. The latest bullet point on a coaching CV -- now in its 20th year -- was Monday's 1-0 English FA Cup quarterfinal replay win over Chelsea's fierce rivals Manchester United, as Demba Ba's cleverly executed volley set up a semifinal against Manchester City at Wembley. Appointed Chelsea's ""interim"" manager following the dismissal of Roberto di Matteo in November with the club's European Champions League title defense in tatters, Benitez has had to work against a backdrop of toxic fan discontent and increasing speculation that Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho will return to Stamford Bridge at the end of this season. Unhappy about club owner Roman Abramovich's decision to appoint the Spaniard, who has previously managed Valencia, Liverpool and Inter Milan, a number of fans have been extremely vocal in their dislike of Benitez. As well as abusive chanting, some fans have even come to Stamford Bridge brandishing homemade banners --""Rafael BenÃ­tez, we're just not in ter im"" and ""Rafa BenÃ­tez, not wanted, never wanted."" Trophy chase . Out of work for two years after his dismissal by Inter, Benitez has ploughed on regardless as he rebuilds his career. The win over United ensures the 52-year-old will lead a club out at Wembley for the first time in his career. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006, but the final was played in Cardiff while Wembley was being redeveloped. Chelsea's vctory on Monday ended United's hopes of winning the double -- securing both the English Premier League and the FA Cup, a trophy the Manchester side have won a record 11 times. Given Benitez's notoriously testy relationship with United manager Alex Ferguson, he could be forgiven for giving himself a quiet pat on the back for sending the FA Cup competition's most successful side packing from Stamford Bridge. In the original tie at United's Old Trafford ground, Chelsea had to come from two goals behind to secure a 2-2 draw. In the replay, Benitez's deployment of Ba, Eden Hazard and Juan Mata up front proved key -- as did Petr Cech's superb one-handed save to deny Javier Hernandez's header to keep Chelsea ahead in the game. ""I am really pleased because the players were doing a great job,"" Benitez told UK match broadcaster ITV. ""Manchester United are a very good team and we did really well. We have good balance between the defense and midfielders. Physically you could see one or two challenges we could not cope but with the ball we were much better. ""It was a fantastic goal by Demba Ba but everyone's performance was really pleasing. Petr Cech made some good saves but at the end of the day we deserved to win."" Inspiration from the heavens . The win ensured Benitez could still end up winning two trophies this season. The other is the second-tier Europa League, into which Chelsea dropped after becoming the first Champions League winner to be eliminated at the group stage the following season. The Blues now face Russian side Rubin Kazan in the first leg of their quarterfinal on Thursday as Benitez seeks to add to his 2004 success with Valencia when the competition was known as the UEFA Cup. ""I won trophies in three different countries,"" Benitez told the Independent newspaper on Saturday as he defended his Chelsea managerial tenure. ""They can't say 'Rafa doesn't know what he is doing.' Just see the CV. It's not just inspiration from the heavens."" Ferguson was magnaminous enough to admit that Benitez's Chelsea had given his own team plenty to think about tactically -- specifically January signing Ba, Hazard and Mata, whose clever pass set up the winning goal. ""We spoke about Demba Ba, with the players' experience of playing against him when he played for Newcastle,"" said Ferguson. ""He scored that exact type of goal against us a while back (for Newcastle) and we were caught napping. ""Their counter attack caused a few problems, especially with their players like Mata and Hazard. Fortunately we did not concede another goal but I couldn't really see us scoring ourselves."" Ferguson and United are now left to concentrate on their pursuit of a 20th league title, which should be a shoo-in give their 15-point advantage over second-placed Manchester City with just eight games to play, ahead of their derby clash on April 8. Chelsea are fourth in the Premier League, two points head of Arsenal, in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League.","Chelsea beat Manchester United 1-0 in FA Cup quarterfinal replay .

"(CNN) -- Luke Donald may have surrendered his supremacy in world golf to Rory McIlroy this year, but he has the chance to get the last laugh of 2012 as the duo go head to head for the final round of the European Tour season on Sunday. The top-ranked duo remained locked at the top of the leaderboard at the $8 million World Tour Championship on Saturday, having moved three shots clear of the 56-man field in Dubai. World No. 1 McIlroy, who emulated his Ryder Cup teammate by winning both the European and U.S. PGA Tour money lists this year, recovered from an opening bogey as he fired five birdies and an eagle in his six-under-par 66. He is already guaranteed $1 million for winning the Race To Dubai with two events to spare, but there is also $1.35 million at stake for finishing first on Sunday. ""I think everyone is looking forward to the number one and number two duel, and that's the way it's panned out,"" said the 23-year-old McIlroy, who has been struggling with a fever. ""I know I'm excited about it, and I'm sure a lot of people are. It will be a great way to finish the 2012 European Tour season."" Donald has now gone 100 holes without dropping a shot at Dubai's Jumeirah Golf Estates' Earth Course following his flawless six-birdie 66. The last player to win a tournament without carding a bogey was Jesper Parnevik in 1995. ""That's pretty good. I guess that's my style -- I don't make too many mistakes,"" said the 35-year-old Englishman. ""It's going to be fun -- great for the crowd and everyone watching around the world. Hopefully we can make some birdies."" Neither player has won the season-ending event, which was launched in 2009 -- when Lee Westwood triumphed to overhaul McIlroy in the money list. They are being chased by South Africa's Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oosthuizen, who carded 67 and 68 respectively on Saturday to be on 14-under 202 after three rounds. Their compatriot Branden Grace, a four-time winner on the European Tour this year, was tied for fifth on 12 under with Dutchman Joost Luiten. Justin Rose, third in the Race To Dubai standings, was tied for seventh on 11 under after a 69 -- one shot ahead of second-placed Swede Peter Hanson (70).","Top-ranked Rory McIlroy shares lead with No. 2 Luke Donald at European Tour finale .

"(CNN) -- Charl Schwartzel stayed on course to achieve his first win since claiming the 2011 U.S. Masters crown as he took a four-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Thailand Championship Friday. The South African shot a seven under par 65 for a 14 under par 130 total at Amata Spring Country Club. Daniel Chopra of Sweden carded a 67 for second place with Japan's Masanori Kobayashi a shot further back. Rising Japanese star Ryo Ishikawa shot a fine 66 for 136 while this year's Masters champion Bubba Watson of the United States and Spain's Sergio Garcia were in the group on 138. Schwartzel is hopeful of ending his 20-month victory drought, particularly as he has found form on the putting green. ""It is still a long way to go. It's half the job done. From my side, I just have to keep playing,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""I've been reading them (putts) well. The stroke feels good. I've gone through a long two years where I've missed a lot of putts. A few goes in, it's nice."" Ryder Cup star Garcia had three birdies in his last five holes to take closer order in a high class field. ""I'm in a decent position,"" he said. Meanwhile, Marcus Fraser carded a second straight three-under-par in the Australian Open in Sydney to take a one-shot lead at halfway. The home hope leads fellow Australians Brendan Jones (71) and first-round leader John Senden, who were tied for second at The Lakes. In-form Englishman Justin Rose was in a group tied for fifth at three under going into the weekend, while American legend Tom Watson carded a superb 68 Friday to make the cut by a stroke. Watson is on the same mark as defending champion Greg Chalmers, who slipped back with a second round 75. The opening event of the 2013 European Tour, the inaugural Nelson Mandela Championship, has yet to get underway at Royal Durban in South Africa. Heavy rainfall left the course flooded for the second straight day but organizers hope to get the delayed event started Saturday. In the Dubai Ladies Masters, the concluding event of the Ladies European Tour, China's Shanshan Feng continued to lead the way after the third round. She carded a 67 for 18-under-par at the Emirates Golf Club, but Dutch woman Dewi Claire Schreefel made inroads into her lead with a tournament record 63 to trail by five.

"(CNN) -- It was a Cinderella story taken straight from the script of a Disney classic. On Friday, Charlie Beljan thought he was dying at the Magnolia Golf Course in Florida, with his professional golf career also about to take a potentially fatal blow . But two days later the American rookie was celebrating his first victory on the U.S.-based circuit, retaining his Tour card for 2013 after a win at the appropriately named Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Beljan was taken to hospital after Friday's second round suffering from an elevated heart rate and numbness in his left arm after finishing the day's round as leader of the tournament. Ignoring advice from doctors to rest, Beljan played on over the weekend and carded a three-under-par round of 69 on Sunday, which secured him a two-shot victory over compatriot Matt Every. As Beljan celebrated with his seven-week old son on the 18th green a band played ""Zippity-Do-Dah"" -- from the 1946 Disney ""Song of the South"" -- and a wonderful day for the Arizona native was complete. ""Every day I drove underneath that Disney sign coming in here that said, 'Where dreams come true,' and that's just what happened this week,"" the 28-year-old told the PGA Tour's official website. ""And I'm so grateful and so honored."" The win means Beljan will not have to navigate the PGA Tour's offseason qualifying school. ""It was incredible,"" Beljan said after picking up the eighth win of his pro career. ""I was happy that I was a PGA Tour champion. I was happy that my wife and my baby were here. It still isn't real."" The good news kept coming for Beljan, who also pocketed a winner's check for $846,000. ""You never know what's going to happen in this game or in the game of life,"" he added. ""You keep plugging away."" ""I believe that everything happens for a reason, and sometimes days like Friday weren't very enjoyable, but the score was wonderful, and I think it taught me that it doesn't matter about your golf swing or your putting stroke.""

"(CNN) -- The European Tour is continuing its global expansion by targeting what it calls ""one of the world's biggest golf markets."" It has launched a Japanese version of its official website -- the first in a non-European language following French, German and Spanish ones. The European Tour does not have any tournaments in Japan, which has its own circuit, but has made big inroads in other Asian venues such as China, South Korea, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. ""It is another important step forward in our strategy of providing a localized experience of the European Tour for our fans all over the world,"" director of broadcasting and new media Mark Lichtenhein said. ""Given the globalization of the European Tour and popularity of golf and the Tour in Japan, this introduction of the first non-European language is an exciting new dimension to our multilingual strategy."" The ruling body will team up with Golf Digest Online to provide the content, marking the beginning of its 2013 Race to Dubai season. ""We believe this agreement will bring huge benefit for Japanese audience, and we will make our best effort to showcase the great tournaments and players from the European Tour,"" Golf Digest Online editor in chief Yasuko Mukai said. The news came as Masters champion Bubba Watson tipped young Japanese golfer Ryo Ishikawa to become the first player from his country to win a major title. The American played with the 21-year-old for the first two rounds of this week's Thailand Championship -- they were tied for seventh after the third round on Saturday. ""He's good enough to win at any level -- he can win a major,"" Watson said of Ishikawa, who finished 108th on the PGA Tour this year and will play fulltime on the U.S. circuit in 2013. They were 11 shots behind South Africa's Charl Schwartzel, who took a five-stroke advantage over Sweden's Daniel Chopra into Sunday's final round -- when he will seek to win his first title since earning his maiden major at the 2011 Masters. The European Tour's opening event for the 2013 season has been plagued by bad weather in South Africa, where home hope Tim Clark shared the lead after a delayed first round on Saturday. Clark and Denmark's Morten Orum Madsen both carded five-under-par 60 at the Nelson Mandela Championship, while South Africa's Lindani Ndwandwe was tied for third with England's Chris Lloyd on 61. At the Australian Open, John Senden took a two-shot lead into Sunday's final round as he seeks to win his home event for the second time. The 41-year-old Queenslander, champion in 2006, was being chased by Ryder Cup star Justin Rose -- who is bidding to become only the second European to win the tournament, following fellow Englishman Lee Westwood in 1997. Meanwhile, China's Shanshan Feng won the Ladies European Tour's season-ending event in Dubai on Saturday, having led from the first round. The world No. 6 preserved her five-shot lead in Saturday's final round to finish with the lowest total since the event began in 2006 -- her 21-under-par 267 beat the 18-under set by Sweden's Annika Sorenstam and In Kyung Kim of South Korea. However, she was unable to beat Sorenstam's record winning margin of six shots from the inaugural staging as she carded 69 to stay clear of Dutch golfer Dewi Claire Schreefel.

Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez became the oldest winner on the European Tour as the 48-year-old took top honors at the Hong Kong Open, while England's Luke Donald won in Japan to reclaim the world No. 2 ranking from Tiger Woods. In Australia, Adam Scott held off Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter to take his first title in 15 months at the Australian Masters and ease the pain of his British Open heartbreak back in July. And if that wasn't enough Sweden's Henrik Stenson completed a hectic Sunday by recording victory in the SA Open Championship at the Serengeti Golf & Wildlife Estate in Pretoria, South Africa. Do 'nice guys' finish last? How to heal major heartbreak . But back to Hong Kong, and the heroics of Jimenez who captured his 19th European Tour title and his 12th since turning 40, by one shot over Sweden's Fredrik Andersson Hed. Jimenez, a European vice captain in the recent Ryder Cup, recorded a final round of 65 to earn his place in the record books by virtue of being six months older than Des Smyth when he won the Madeira Islands Open in 2001. ""It's very nice -- I hope it's not the last one,"" Jimenez joked in quotes on the European Tour's official website. ""The most important thing, I do what I like to do in my life, and golf has given me all of this pleasure. Winning now, at 48, my goodness -- 24 years I've been on the Tour. ""I still love it and I think that is fantastic, to love what you're doing, and enjoy yourself, keep fit, keep working myself a little bit and stretching a lot, and that's the main thing to do to compete with the new guns. ""I really love this place. I love the golf course -- it's a great golf course where you have to control the ball very well, it's not a matter of distance."" There were mixed fortunes for two other players who played their part in Europe's remarkable Ryder Cup comeback in Medinah. Luke Donald cruised to victory at the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Japan by five shots to reclaim the world No. 2 ranking from 14-time major winner Tiger Woods. Donald, who led from the front for most of the competition in Miyazaki, still has a long way to go to topple Rory McIlroy who is out in front of the rankings but he was delighted with his win. He said on micro-blogging site Twitter: ""BOOM!! 3rd win of the year - honored to add my name to the great Champions that have won the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament. Golfer: I thought I was going to die . ""Loved my week here in Japan - the Dunlop Phoenix is a great event, on a great course, great food, great beer....it's just great!"" But Ian Poulter was pipped to the Australian Masters crown by Adam Scott after the Englishman carded a disappointing final round. With the pair well clear of the chasing pack Sunday came down to a straight shoot out between the pair and Scott went some way to erasing the painful memory of his British Open experience, when he led with four holes left and ended up losing. Scott's triumph means he has continued his run of winning at least one event in every season since 2001. After receiving his trophy and the golden jacket that goes with it he set his sights on a jacket of a different color -- the green one awarded to the winner of the Masters in Augusta. ""It's pretty awesome to be able to slip this jacket on. Maybe I can set the theme of winning jackets and turn it green next year before I come back to defend,"" he was quoted as saying on the tournament's website. ""I haven't been dwelling on what happened at the Open at all, I put that out of my head in the week afterwards. ""I had to, otherwise you'd never come back to a golf course, would you? It's kind of painful. I'd been working hard and I hadn't quite got back in that position until today, but I felt good out there. ""I just had to trust that all the work that I'd put into my game was going to hold up and to not get in my own way is the big thing. ""Not (to) have thoughts of what happened at the Open or any other negative thoughts come into play -- that's just part of the mental side of this game."" The last of Sunday's winner was 28-year-old Stenson, who held off the late challenge of George Coetzee to end a five-year run without a European Tour victory. He also secured his place at next week's World Tour Championship in Dubai after closing the tournament on 17-under, despite a blip half way through his round when he fell back to level pegging with his South African challenger. ""It was great that I came down here,"" he told the European Tour website. ""One of the bigger reasons was I was 59th in The Race to Dubai standings and I needed a good week. ""I made it difficult for myself in the middle of the round there but hung in there and stayed patient. I played well to shoot 17 under par around here in these windy conditions. It was playing a lot harder today.""","Four tournaments in three continents decided on busy Sunday in the world of golf .

"(CNN) -- Thomas Aiken ensured South Africa continued to dominate the European Tour events after claiming victory by three shots at the Avantha Masters in India Sunday . Aiken sealed the top prize of $392,000 after seeing off local favorite Gaganjeet Bhullar at the Greg Norman-designed par-72 Jaypee Greens outside New Delhi. The 29-year-old is the sixth South African to win a European tour event this year following Charl Schwartzel's victory at the Alfred Dunhill championships, Louis Oosthuizen's win at the Volvo Golf Champions, Richard Sterne's success in Johannesburg, Darren Fichardt's triumph at the Africa Open and Dawie Van der Walt's effort at the Tshwane Open. Aiken, who is from Johannesburg, held off the challenge of Bhullar, who birdied the first three holes, had an eagle on the fifth before a spectacular finish saw him birdie three of the last five holes. ""It's a big relief to win because the others played unbelievable golf,"" 2011 Open de Espana winner Aiken told reporters. ""There was no breathing space the whole day with Gaganjeet having so many birdies towards the end. ""It was no walk in the park, but I think I played the par-fives well. This has been a fantastic week in India and ended just the way I wanted it to."" The home supporters had hoped Bhullar could give them something to celebrate, but despite being roared on by around 500 fans, he was unable to catch Aiken at the top of the leaderboard. ""After a few weeks, no one will remember that I came second. Everyone will only talk of Thomas,"" he told reporters. ""But the important thing is that my game has improved. ""This tournament was like a putting competition. Everyone was hitting the ball long, it all depended on how you putted. I thought Thomas would make a mistake somewhere, but he played solidly the last two days."" Elsewhere, Prayad Marksaeng became only the third Thai to win his country's national championship after claiming a two-stroke win to claim the $180,000 top prize at the Thailand Open Sunday. ""This means so much to me,"" Prayad said, according to a statement by the tournament organizers. ""Yes I cried a bit... I am happy the King's Trophy will stay in Thailand.""

"(CNN) -- It's understandable to feel stress when your livelihood is on the line, but Charlie Beljan is suffering more than most. ""He kept saying he thought he was going to die,"" the golfer's caddy Rick Adcox said after Friday's second round of the PGA Tour's final tournament of 2012, held at Disney World in Florida. ""A couple times I thought he might pass out. He just said, 'I'm gonna keep going until I pass out or they take me off.' "" Beljan is fighting to keep his full tour card after a difficult first season on the circuit -- the top 125 players qualify for next season, and he is in 139th place. The stress is taking its toll on the 28-year-old. He was taken to hospital straight after his round, having suffered increased heart rate, high blood pressure and numbness in his arms. Follow Beljan's progress with latest scores from PGA Tour . Incredibly, despite all this he was leading the tournament, which is known as the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. ""I don't know how he hit the golf ball feeling the way he was feeling,"" Adcox said on the PGA Tour's official website. ""I thought he was going to stop when he heard what his blood pressure was."" Adcox said his boss had been hospitalized last month after fainting on a plane flight, but doctors had not found the cause. Beljan, who became a first-time father less than two months ago, carded an incredible round of eight-under-par 64 to build a three-shot lead in the $4.7 million event. The first prize is $846,000 -- and Beljan is determined to play on so he can add to his total of $527,528 from 21 tournaments this year. ""Tour official says Charlie Beljan will play today @ Disney after being taken to the hospital on Friday,"" Golf Channel journalist Rex Hoggard wrote on Twitter before Saturday's third round. Beljan told the broadcaster on Friday he hoped it was just a panic attack. PGA Tour reporter Brian Wacker confirmed the news. ""Doc recommended he not play but found nothing wrong physically. Appears to be anxiety related. Beljan is playing,"" Wacker wrote on Twitter. And he played well, carding 71 to take a two-shot lead into Sunday's final round. At this stage he is projected to finish 63rd on the money list. ""I honestly didn't think I was going to get through it,"" Beljan said. ""I just stayed strong."" Beljan had no idea that he was leading the tournament during Friday's round. ""It's nice to be able to walk around and smile,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Yani Tseng's two-year reign at the top of women's golf is over. Five-time major winner Tseng has been at the top of the Rolex World Rankings since February 2011, but the Taiwanese star has finally been usurped by American Stacy Lewis. Lewis produced an eight-under-par final round of 64 to clinch the Founders Cup in Phoenix Arizona, just two weeks after winning the HSBC Women's Champions event in Singapore. The Ohio native is only the second U.S. player to occupy the coveted berth after Cristie Kerr also reached the top in June 2010. Lewis clawed back a three-stroke deficit to Japan's Ai Miyazato to eventually finish three shots ahead of the former world No. 1. The final round's 16th hole proved decisive, with Miyazato slipping and allowing Lewis to take control. ""It's awesome,"" Lewis told the LPGA Tour's official website when asked about the win. ""I played great today. Myself and Ai we just went back and forth all day; she was making putts, I was making putts. ""I was certainly surprised she finished the way she did, but to make those two putts I did on 16 and 17 was pretty unbelievable and I'm just really speechless."" If Lewis' fightback at the Wildfire Golf Club journey was stirring, it is nothing compared to the story of her rise to the top. A decade ago the 2011 Kraft Nabisco Championship winner underwent surgery for scoliosis, following a childhood plagued by back problems. ""Yeah, it's almost 10 years ago I was having surgery, I was going into surgery to put a rod and five screws in my back,"" added Lewis. ""That's not normal, that's not supposed to happen. I mean, I'm not really supposed to be here. ""I know that there's a reason and I know that everything happens for a reason. Every setback you have along the way, everything good that happens, it all happens for a reason. ""I couldn't have dreamed the kid growing up wearing a back brace 18 hours a day that is the No. 1 player in the world. I don't know, I don't know what to say."" Lewis is the seventh player to top the rankings.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova faces a showdown with seven-time grand slam champion Venus Williams at the Australian Open after producing another star showing. The world No. 2, who won her opening match 6-0, 6-0, repeated the feat as she swept aside Japan's Misaki Doi. Sharapova is the first female player to record ""double bagel"" wins at a grand slam since Wendy Turnbull in Australia in 1985. Sharapova takes on Australian boys . But that will count for little when the 2008 champion goes up against Williams in what promises to be a hard-fought affair. ""There are certainly no secrets coming into that match-up,"" Sharapova told reporters of the clash against Williams. ""We've played against each other many times. You know, despite the fact that she might not be seeded high or didn't play for a little bit, she's still a very experienced player and a tremendous athlete. I hope for it to be a great match."" Defiant Serena vows to overcome injury after Australian Open scare . Williams, whose last grand slam title came at Wimbledon in 2008, booked her place in the third round with a comfortable 6-3 6-3 win over Alize Cornet on Rod Laver Arena. The 32-year-old has been battling injury and illness over the past two years but clawed her way back to 26th in the world rankings following her 44th career title in Luxembourg. And while Sharapova leads the pair's head-to-head record 4-3, Williams is confident she can prevail despite her opponent's impressive start to the tournament. ""There's going to be days when you play great and win, and there's going to be days when you play not as great and you win,"" she said. ""Whatever day that is, you have to win. It's not about for me I have to play perfect every match. I don't have that mentality."" ""I know I'm not the highest seed, so I realize I'm probably going to have to play someone and someone is going to have to play me. That's pretty much what it is. ""I don't focus on the best game.

""I think, yeah, that's what it was. I got tight and then you start missing some balls. ""You probably think a little bit too much.

"(CNN) -- Of all the arguments swirling around the legality of same-sex marriage, it's clear that a major concern is, as always, the kids. Supporters argue that same-sex parents need to provide their children with a stable and supportive family home, complete with the legal protections afforded heterosexual married couples. Opponents claim that children raised by same-sex parents are wounded in some fundamental way by being denied the ""normal"" benefits of having both a mother and father at home. What is lost, remarkably, in both these arguments is the science that enabled families headed by same-sex couples to exist at all. Until recently, families had to consist, at least at the outset, of a mommy and a daddy, each biologically necessary to bring children into being. Even if the mother died in childbirth or the father disappeared shortly thereafter, the physiological basis of the nuclear family remained intact: one mother, one father, and a child conceived of their union. From this unvarying biological fact came millennia of social norms and structures. Mothers stayed with their children to provide nourishment and nurture in the early days of infancy; fathers stayed, generally, to ensure that their genetic offspring had some chance of reaching adulthood and sustaining the family line. Love didn't count so much in marriage, historically speaking, nor was there a sense of purpose that extended beyond the creation of children. And because these children could only be born through heterosexual sex, no model of marriage outside these biologically driven norms existed. All this changed, however, with the advent of assisted reproduction technologies, commonly known as ART. As long ago as the 18th century, instances of artificial insemination with a husband's sperm were reported. But the first case of insemination with donor sperm happened in the 19th century, when a doctor in Philadelphia used sperm from one of his best-looking medical students to impregnate a supposedly infertile woman. The technique worked, a child was born and the woman (who was told she was having an operation to cure her infertility) never knew of the switch. After that point, as word slowly spread, doctors began to quietly experiment with artificial insemination with donor sperm, working only with infertile heterosexual couples, turning to friends of the couple or -- once again -- their medical students. Over time, though, as the practice became more widespread and eventually commercial, single and lesbian women began availing themselves of the wares sold openly from sperm banks such as California Cryobank and Cryos International. For a few hundred dollars a vial, women began creating families that could not have been imagined before; families created from the beginning without a father. Even more radical was the invention, in 1978, of in-vitro fertilization, or IVF, the now-common technique in which egg and sperm meet in a laboratory petri dish and create an embryo that is then implanted in the would-be mother's womb. Once again, the earliest users of IVF were infertile heterosexual couples; and once again, the technology soon slipped into wider social circles, enabling people to become parents in a whole range of previously unimaginable ways. There was always adoption, but that avenue was largely closed to gay couples. Now, using IVF and a surrogate carrier, a gay man could contract for the creation of a child both legally and socially his. Using IVF, a surrogate and donated eggs, a gay couple could mix and match their sperm with the desired characteristics of an egg donor, creating children with, say, the actual genes of one partner and the mimicked characteristics of the other. Today, anecdotal data suggest that gay men are among the largest users of surrogacy services. Cryobank reports that in 2009, one-third of its clients were lesbian couples. Ten years ago, it was 7%. Technology has enabled what biology could not, creating millions of children for parents desperate to conceive them. Most of these formerly infertile parents are straight; but many, and a rapidly growing number, are gay. They are the families created on the back of technological advance, families whose legal status has not yet caught up with their lives. Technology always moves faster than the law. But in these cases, the products of technological advances are not faster vehicles or better widgets. They are children, hundreds of thousands of them, growing up in families no longer constrained by nature's original dictate. It is kids who are shaping different norms of parenting and different kinds of care. And it is kids who deserve the same rights afforded their friends and classmates -- the right to grow up in a legally sanctioned family, regardless of who their parents are and how they came into being. To treat them otherwise would be truly inconceivable. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Debora Spar.","Debora Spar: Historically, families could not begin without a mother and father .

"(CNN) -- Since its inception in 2009, the Race To Dubai has provided European golf with a thrilling battle for big bucks that has gone to the final day of the season. But not this year. Such has been Rory McIlroy's dominance in 2012 that the world No. 1 has sealed a notable money list double with two tournaments still to play. The 23-year-old can defend his Hong Kong Open title next week and then go to Dubai for the $8 million World Tour Championship without the pressure of the last three years, when he was twice the European Tour's No. 2. ""It has been one of my main goals to become number one in Europe ever since securing my card five years ago, so to end the year as the number one on both the European and U.S. PGA Tours is absolutely amazing,"" McIlroy said after clinching the title with third place at the Singapore Open on Sunday. He emulated Luke Donald's efforts from last year, but the Englishman needed to play in extra Fall Series events to clinch the American crown on the final day of the season. 'Wozilroy' struggling in Singapore . McIlroy became the youngest player to win the European money list since Scotland's Sandy Lyle did so at the age of 21 in 1979 and 22 the following year. ""I set myself a number of ambitious goals at the start of the year, and to have ticked so many of the boxes feels great,"" said McIlroy, who displaced Donald at the top of the rankings and won his second major title at the PGA Championship after recovering from a mid-season slump. ""I've still got two events remaining this year, and the goal is still to try and win at least once more before the end of the season. Beyond that, I'm looking forward to a good break over the winter! ""Monty (Colin Montgomerie) won eight Orders of Merit in his prime, and I have only won one so far, so there is plenty of ground to make up. But to be able to go into 2013 as the number one on both tours is hugely satisfying."" McIlroy won $8 million in PGA Tour events and has â‚¬3,696,597 ($4.7 million) from Europe's almost worldwide swing -- though both circuits have several co-sanctioned tournaments. McIlroy's closest European rival, Ryder Cup teammate Peter Hanson, chose not to play in Singapore and will not line up again until Dubai. Louis Oosthuizen could have delayed McIlroy's crowning for another week, but the South African lost in a playoff at Sentosa to Matteo Manassero. The 19-year-old Italian eagled the third extra hole to deny 2010 British Open champion Oosthuizen his third title of 2012. Manassero became the first teenager to win three European Tour titles, having been the youngest to win one in 2010. McIlroy also eagled his last hole to surge up the leaderboard with a six-under-par 65 that left him three shots behind the top duo. Denmark's Thomas Bjorn was another shot back in fourth on nine under overall, while Australia's Adam Scott and Italian Francesco Molinari tied for fifth. The tournament, which is seeking a new sponsor following the withdrawal of Barclays, was plagued by bad weather but went the distance this year -- in 2011 it was reduced to 54 holes.","Rory McIlroy completes European Tour/PGA Tour money list double on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy's bid to clinch the European Tour money list has been hit by bad weather in Singapore -- and the world's No. 1 golfer has revealed that his tennis star girlfriend is not enjoying the experience. Caroline Wozniacki traveled to Asia to be by his side after her season ended last weekend at a tournament final in Bulgaria, but the couple -- dubbed ""Wozilroy"" -- has had to put up with rain and early-morning starts. ""Nearly 12 hours at the golf course already today! @CaroWozniacki really enjoying her holiday this week... Not!!,"" he wrote on Twitter, where he posted a less than flattering picture of the Dane slumped asleep on a desk. McIlroy, unable to complete his first round on Thursday, came back early to post a one-under-par 70 and was then level after 12 holes when the second round of the $6 million event was again halted. ""Now I remember why golf isn't my sport! Waking up at 5.15 isn't really my thing lol... #notamorningperson,"" Wozniacki posted on Twitter. McIlroy could add to his PGA Tour money list title by winning in Singapore, where officials face the prospect of cutting the tournament to 54 holes for the second year in a row if the disruptions continue. However, he is battling illness which may mean he has to wait until next week's Hong Kong Open title defense or the season-ending World Tour Championship in Dubai before he can emulate Luke Donald's feat last year. ""I'm struggling a bit and not feeling 100%,"" the 23-year-old told reporters. ""Maybe it's a good thing that the humidity is so high because I might be able to sweat it out."" This time last year McIlroy was suffering with an illness suspected to be Dengue Fever, and he ended up finishing second in the Race To Dubai standings behind Donald.

The Serbian world No. 1 is in a different half of the draw to Andy Murray, who registered his first grand slam success at the U.S. Open last year, and the British No. 1 could face Roger Federer in the semifinals. The Swiss veteran, who has 17 major titles to his name, takes on Mathieu's compatriot Benoit Paire in round one while Murray plays Dutchman Robin Haase.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova's preparations for the Australian Open suffered a blow when she was forced to pull out of the season opening tournament in Brisbane Tuesday with a right collarbone injury. The World No.2 was due to play Australian wildcard Jarmila Gajdosova in the second round, but said she had ""ran out of time"" in her battle to recover from the problem. ""I have a bit of inflammation in my collarbone,"" she told the official tournament website. The 25-year-old Russian said she had sent scans to her doctor in New York to assess the injury, which forced her out of an exhibition tournament in South Korea last week. ""He told me I couldn't really do much overhead training for about a week,"" revealed Sharapova. ""So to be fair, I haven't really given myself a chance to pretty much hit any serves or anything over my head. Just been practicing groundstrokes,"" she added. The reigning French Open champion will also skip next week's WTA tournament in Sydney to recover in time for the start of the Australian Open on January 14. Sharapova was also forced to pull out of last year's Brisbane tournament, but went on to reach the final of the Australian Open, where she was beaten by Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. Azarenka is the top seed in Brisbane and will play her second round match against Sabine Lisicki of Germany Wednesday. Gajdosova will play lucky loser Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine, who replaces Sharapova in the draw. In second round action Tuesday, Serena Williams needed exactly one hour to reach the quarterfinals with a crushing 6-2 6-2 win over France's Alize Cornet in the night session. The 15-times grand slam winner was, like Sharapova, an injury doubt before the start of the season, but has shrugged off a foot problem to look in ominous early season form. She hit 25 winners, including six aces, to overpower Cornet. But former champion and sixth seed Petra Kvitova was sent crashing 6-4 7-5 by Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Fifth-seeded Italian Sara Errani also lost in three sets to 2012 runner-up Daniela Hantuchova 4-6 6-1 7-5.

""I am extremely disappointed to announce that I have to withdraw from the Australian Open,"" Isner, who had been seeded 13th for the year's first grand slam, told the ATP Tour's official website on Thursday. ""I have been feeling some discomfort in my knee and have recently learned that I have a bone bruise. ""My doctors have told me that continuing to play on the knee could result in a more serious injury, so I have regrettably decided not to compete in Melbourne and use the time to fully recover."" Isner, a winner of five titles since turning pro in 2007, has never advanced beyond the fourth round of the Melbourne grand slam. He will be replaced in the draw by a lucky loser from one of the qualifying competitions. The 27-year-old's best performance in one of tennis' four marquee tournaments came in 2010 when he reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open. Harrison chalked up his first ever win over an opponent ranked inside the world's top 15 with his 6-4 6-4 success against Isner on Wednesday, but he lost his quarterfinal match 6-4 6-2 to Frenchman Julien Benneteau. Benneteau, the 2012 Sydney runner-up, will now be seeded at the Australian Open following Isner's withdrawal. He will play big-serving Kevin Anderson in the Sydney semifinals after the 36th-ranked South African beat Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin 6-4 6-3. World No. 35 Benneteau holds a 2-0 winning career record over Anderson and he is confident of extending that in their last four contest. ""He's playing good,"" said the 31-year-old. ""He's a dangerous player with a very big serve but I know I can beat him."" Australia's Bernard Tomic also reached the last four, with the 20-year-old beating veteran Finn Jarkko Nieminen 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 6-2. He will face either Italian third seed Andreas Seppi or Spanish No. 8 Marcel Granollers.","U.S. No. 1 John Isner will miss the Australian Open due to a bruised bone in knee .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams posted an ominous message to her rivals after starting 2013 by taking the Brisbane International title Saturday with a straight sets demolition of Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Williams needed just 50 minutes on the Pat Rafter Arena for a 6-2 6-1 victory in just 50 minutes and will go into the Australian Open Monday week as firm favorite. She has won a staggering 35 of 36 matches since last year's French Open and after her latest victory admitted she was in prime form. ""I was looking at a lot of old matches on YouTube and I feel like right now I'm playing some of my best tennis,"" she told the official tournament website. ""I feel like I want to do better and play better still, and I've always felt like I could play better."" Her rivals for the opening grand slam of the season will be hoping that is not the case and certainly the overpowered Pavlyuchenkova was in awe of her opponent. ""When she's on fire there's not much I can do,"" Pavlyuchenkova said.""You have to play your best tennis every point, which is quite tough."" Third seed Williams had a free run when World No.1 Victoria Azarenka pulled out of their semifinal rather than risk a toe injury ahead of Melbourne, while second-ranked Sharapova also withdrew before the start of the tournament with a collarbone injury. Williams, who recently had minor foot surgery, took control of the title match from 2-2 in the opener, winning seven games in a row. Pavlyuchenkova could offer little response to nine aces and 24 winners as Williams claimed her 47th career WTA title. ""That was really good -- I think I just kind of zoned and I felt like I really wanted to do well,"" Williams added. Meanwhile, defending men's champion Andy Murray reached the final of the ATP event in Brisbane as semifinal opponent Kei Nishikori of Japan pulled out injured in the second set. The fifth seed Nishikori had led 4-1 in the opener before being troubled by a left knee injury. Murray was leading 6-4 2-0 in 45 minutes when he called it a day. The World No.3 will play Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria who reached his first ATP final by edging out Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 6-3 5-7 7-6. ""I have to say I'm very, very happy. It's definitely it's a great feeling,"" the 21-year-old said. In other ATP action Saturday, France's Richard Gasquet beat Nikolay Davydenko of Russia 3-6 7-6 6-3 to win the Qatar Open title. It was Gasquet's eighth career ATP title.","Serena Williams claims Brisbane International title .

"(CNN) -- The 2013 tennis season may only be in its fledgling stages but already the heat is well and truly on for those preparing for the year's first major. As the great and good on the men's and women's circuits fine tune their game ahead of the Australian Open that starts in Melbourne on Monday, they are having to contend with stifling temperatures in Sydney. According to the Australia Bureau of Meteorology, Monday was the hottest day in the country since records began over 100 years ago with an average temperature of 40.3 degrees. Officials in New South Wales have warned of a ""catastrophic"" fire threat as strong winds combine with the heat to increase the danger of bushfires spreading out of control. Players had to battle heat that reached 41.4 deg in Sydney, with world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska claiming it was ""too hot"" to play and that officials should have halted proceedings under their extreme heat policy. But the Pole, along with the other players scheduled on Tuesday, battled through the searing sunshine with the help of regular breaks, ice towels and gallons of liquid. ""I think this is too hot to play tennis,"" Radwanska told reporters at a press conference. ""Even for players, for ball kids, for even the people sitting out there, I think it's just too hot."" One saving grace for Radwanska was her quick 6-4 6-3 victory over Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm which meant she was only on court for 68 minutes. Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova battled through to a 7-6 1-6 6-2 victory over former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki, though both players benefited from a heat break before contesting the deciding set. Kuznetsova told reporters: ""I think it shows you one more time how tough the tennis is right now. How players have to be fit to play in the hot conditions, the windy conditions. We're like iron women almost. ""It was very hot out there. In the second set the heat definitely disturbed me a lot. But the break really helped me before the third set."" The 2011 French Open champion, Li Na of China, was quoted as saying by AFP that she felt like she was ""playing in a sauna."" Germany's Angelique Kerber triumphed 6-2 7-5 over Russian qualifier Galina Voskoboeva who took a medical time out because of the extreme heat. Kerber: ""It was unbelievably hot. Usually I practice before my matches, 30 to 35 minutes, today it was just 10 or 15 minutes because I couldn't play more. It's tough to play in these conditions. ""I was trying to focus on the next point and not thinking about the heat, the sun and the weather. The whole match was tough from the first point. I'm happy I won in two sets."" Temperatures were due to cool off for Wednesday's play but by the end of the week the thermometer will be back up to 37 degrees in Melbourne, according to Jenny Harrison from the CNN Weather Center. She told CNN's World Sport show: ""We do see this every couple of years but this is record-breaking heat. Monday has been confirmed as the hottest day across Australia since records began. ""It looks as if Tuesday, once we get the stats in, could be the hottest day and outdo Monday. ""What has happened in the last few hours is a front has come through across the south east of Australia. In literally an hour the temperature in Sydney has dropped more than 10 degrees. ""Melbourne is cooler than that as the front went through there first. But in Melbourne by the end of the week the temperature is going to rise again, getting well above average.""","Record temperatures hit Australia during tennis tournament in Sydney .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray struggled in the Australian heat as he survived a scare against world number 199 John Millman at the Brisbane International Thursday. The U.S.Open champion, ranked third in the world, appeared to struggle with the humidity after racing through the first set 6-1 in just 30 minutes. Millman, 23, was playing just his fifth match on the main ATP tour and shocked Murray by taking the second set 7-5. And despite the Briton constantly clutching his stomach and legs, Millman was unable to repeat his heroics in the final set as Murray prevailed 6-3. ""It's incredibly humid here and I've had a lot of travelling too, and there were so many long points of very high intensity,"" Murray told reporters. ""It's just taking a little while to adjust to playing matches again after such a long period. ""At the beginning of most years the first few matches can be tough on the body, but you get used to it and you feel better and better. ""That was the perfect first match for me in many ways, to go through some tough moments, a lot of long rallies and close games and important points, and to come through."" Injured Sharapova pulls out of Brisbane . Elsewhere, Serena Williams set up a semifinal showdown with world number one Victoria Azarenka. Williams, the reigning Wimbledon, Olympic and U.S.Open champion, saw off 19-year-old Sloane Stevens 6-4 6-3. Williams has won 11 of the 12 matches she has played against Azarenka and triumphed in all five games against the Belorussian in 2012. But the 31-year-old played down her chances of winning the upcoming contest. She told reporters: ""I'm going up against the best player in the world,"" Williams said. ""She's had a fabulous year. She won the Australian Open and has been the most consistent all year. ""I've got nothing to lose. I can go out there and see where my game is at."" Wozniacki wilts in Brisbane . Azarenka booked her place in the last four following a 6-1 6-0 win over Kazakhstan's Ksenia Pervak. ""It's a tough match, there is no question about it,"" she said ahead of the Williams clash. ""I'm looking forward to it. There is one more chance for us to meet (before Melbourne) and it's going to be a great test for the Australian Open. ""I'm not looking for easy matches. The tougher it is the more exciting for me it's going to be, so I'm quite happy with that."" Elsewhere, U.S. star John Isner faces a race against time to be fit for the Australian Open. The world number 14 withdrew from the Hopman Cup in Perth Thursday after suffering an injury to his right knee. Djokovic's Australian Open preparations suffer hiccup . Meanwhile, home favorite Bernard Tomic built on his shock win over world number one Novak Djokovic by defeating Andreas Seppi. The 20-year-old Australian eased to a 6-3 7-5 victory to bolster his confidence ahead of this month's grand slam. ""It's an amazing preparation before the Australian Open,"" he told reporters. ""I have won three matches that are important for the summer of tennis in Melbourne. ""To beat Novak last night and then win again tonight was huge for me."" In the women's section, 16-year-old Ashleigh Barty stunned former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-0 6-3. ""I don't even know what happened out there,"" Barty said. ""It was incredible.""","Andy Murray struggled with the humidity during his victory over world number 199 John Millman .

"(CNN) -- Long Run edged outsider Captain Chris to reclaim the prestigious King George VI Chase crown at Kempton Park on Boxing Day. The seven-year-old gelding, ridden by Sam Waley-Cohen, made a bad mistake five from home and trailed going over the final fence of the three-mile steeplechase before conjuring up a driving finish. Long Run got up with two strides remaining to pip 16-1 shot Captain Chris, who had been given every chance by jockey Richard Johnson. 7-1 French shot Grand Crus finished a distant third on the grueling heavy ground.

"(CNN) -- Tina Maze has become the first woman to surpass 2,000 points in a World Cup season after claiming a ninth victory of the season in the women's downhill at Garmisch, Germany on Saturday. The 29-year-old Slovenian's tally of 2,024 points means she surpasses Austrian legend Hermann Maier's record of 2,000 points set 13 years ago. ""To get over 2000 points in a season is incredible, it's an amazing thing to do. I'm very proud, but it probably won't sink in until the season is over,"" Maze said. Maze, who secured the overall World Cup title in Meribel last weekend, recorded a winning time of one minute 40.46 seconds down the three-kilometer Kandahar course. Read: Tomba's great regret . America's Laurenne Ross was second with Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch finishing third.

"(CNN) -- Somewhere, in a parallel dimension, when cyclist Tyler Hamilton appears on live video link beamed in to a court room in the Spanish city of Madrid on Tuesday, his testimony detailing the breadth and impunity of doping within his sport would send shock waves across the world. But, in the here and now, such is the public's current fatigue of drug revelations in sport that his appearance at the trial of the Operation Puerto scandal -- where Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes is accused of masterminding a blood doping network at the highest level of professional cycling -- will be met with little more than a collective shrug. Hamilton was an American cyclist who won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics before riding with Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France. He has already detailed his own drug-taking exploits in his book ""The Secret Race,"" helping to lift the lid on the murky, dangerous and in some cases criminal world of performance-enhancing drugs. But those revelations -- which implicated Armstrong as much as himself -- were just the tip of the iceberg. From Armstrong's carefully managed but ultimately soulless confession to doping fraud on Oprah to the release of a damning report by the Australian Crime Commission -- the government's top criminal intelligence body -- in to widespread doping in some of the country's top sports and the ongoing Operation Puerto trial, the fidelity of sportsmen and women is increasingly being called into question. ""I don't think anything has changed, there have been doping cheats in sports for a long, long time, and there are still doping cheats in sports,"" John Fahey, president of the World Anti Doping Agency, told CNN. ""What we are seeing in more recent days is a number of revelations which give us some sort of indication that, in some cases, it's quite widespread. I think we now know there was a period in cycling where it was extremely widespread."" Poachers versus gamekeepers . But while the reputation of sports stars has taken a hit, the people charged with catching them -- the various different governing bodies and, at the top, WADA -- remain one step behind the dopers. Armstrong, after all, claimed correctly that he never failed a drugs test. Yet for the man who heads the world's top anti-doping body, the revelations are a move in the right direction, rather than proof of failure. ""Has cycling fixed itself up? Well, I don't know,"" admitted Fahey, before suggesting that the revelations ""makes us all think about the problem, and that's not such a bad thing."" ""I would much sooner see all of these things about doping in sport on the surface than to know that there was doping in sport and we don't know about it,"" he added. Despite the public's doping fatigue, the revelations that have emerged from the Operation Puerto trial so far have been shocking. Fuentes has been accused, along with his sister and three other defendants from various other cycling teams, of running a blood doping ring that involved transfusions of re-oxygenated blood. Blood doping involves using hormones or transfusions to boost the numbers of red cells in the body. This can increase a sportsman or woman's ability to carry oxygen to the muscles, a distinct advantage in endurance sports. Hotel transfusion . Several top names in cycling have been implicated. According to a 2006 report in Spanish newspaper El Pais Tyler Hamilton paid Fuentes at least $47,000 for the procedure. But doping wasn't a criminal offence in Spain in 2006 when Fuentes was arrested and hundreds of bags of blood from his clients seized. Instead they have been accused of endangering public health, charges they deny. WADA's own medical expert Dr. Yorck Olaf Schumacher gave a damning appraisal of the health risks that many of the cyclists faced when he testified in Spain, according to Cycling News website which is covering the trial. ""Extracting half a liter or a liter of blood presents a greater risk than extracting the usual amounts. That's up to 20% of the body's total, whereas you would only extract 1% for a blood analysis,"" he said. ""A hotel does not fulfill the conditions required for a transfusion,"" he added, referring to the alleged unsanitary conditions in which the blood doping took place. ""A cool bag for picnics isn't the best thing for transporting blood."" Schumacher also raised the possibility that cyclists would have been exposed to greater risk of contracting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. ""We've been fighting this case now for the best part of seven years,"" said Fahey, before turning his attentions to other sports. ""Those hundreds of blood bags that appear to belong to many different types of sportsmen and women, so (it's) not just one sport. We want to know who they are, we want to know what's in those bags, and all of that knowledge and information passed on to the authorities that will take action against the owners of that blood."" Soccer stars implicated? Many of the names attached to those damning, currently anonymous blood bags could contain the names of well-known soccer players. During the trial Fuentes told the court that he had many clients in the world of soccer, athletics and boxing. But the judge ruled that Fuentes would not be compelled to reveal names. Fuentes' revelations have not gone unnoticed by WADA officials, who believe soccer's governing body FIFA could do much more to tackle alleged doping in the game -- particularly the use of EPO, or erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidney that is injected to stimulate red blood cell production that has long been used by cyclists. ""I acknowledge that under the world body, FIFA, there is an anti-doping program,"" said Fahey. ""They can do more, they've got to test players, many more of them, and make sure they are testing for the drug of choice EPO. Otherwise they are paying lip service to the issue rather than convincing anybody that they've got an effective program."" The answer, according to Fahey, is to insist on a biological profile and passport for each player, an issue he raised with Sepp Blatter, the secretary general of FIFA, when they met last week. FIFA announced after that meeting that it will introduce biological profiles at June's Confederations Cup tournament in Brazil. The scheme will see a biological profile taken from each player two months before so that any marked changes in that profile at the tournament could point to blood doping or hormone use. ""I would like to see, particularly team sports, take up the athlete's biological passport,"" Fahey said. ""There is absolutely no reason why in the major codes of football, and in the major sporting events right throughout the world they shouldn't all (have) the tool known as the biological passport. That will do a lot to stamp out doping in sport, and most of those major codes can easily afford the cost of running that program."" But, for now, the focus remains on cycling, Operation Puerto, Fuentes and Tyler Hamilton's testimony. Fahey hopes that the trial will be a watershed moment for doping in sport. ""This is not the first court case that we've had on this subject over the past seven years, but we will continue to exhaust all legal rights,"" Fahey said. ""We believe it is important enough to do that. I hope this may well be the final court case that we have to participate in.""","CNN spoke to the president of the World Anti Doping Agency John Fahey .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka suffered a blow in the preparations to her Australian Open title defense on Friday, pulling out of a much-anticipated rematch with Serena Williams due to a toe problem. The Belorussian was due to play her U.S. Open final conqueror in the semis of the Brisbane International, her first top-level warmup event for the season's opening grand slam -- which starts on January 14. World No. 2 Maria Sharapova is also battling to be fit for Melbourne, having withdrawn before the beginning of the Brisbane tournament due to a collarbone problem. ""It's a right toe infection -- it's been there for about 10 days and it's been getting worse,"" Azarenka told reporters. ""I had to take action on it, which I did yesterday -- it was a minor surgery, I had to take something out of my toe. And unfortunately I didn't have enough time to recover to be able to play the semifinals today."" The 23-year-old won her first grand slam title in Melbourne last January before going on to top the rankings and become the WTA Tour's leading prize money winner for 2012. ""I had to make sure I could be fully recovered and ready for the Australian Open. It's a compromise I kind of had to take,"" she said. ""The doctor had told me I wouldn't be able to play for three, four days, but today I saw him in the morning and he said it was actually much better than he thought -- he expected a much worse outcome. So maybe two days and I can start slowly."" Williams, who last month also had toe surgery, will play Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in Saturday's final. ""I had that toe problem just a couple of weeks ago and it's painful -- God, it's so painful. Doesn't sound painful, but it is. You can't walk with that. I hope she gets better fast,"" the American said. ""I'm definitely doing enough to prepare and be ready. I feel like even though I didn't play a match tonight I played some really good matches here."" Pavlyuchenkova ended the dream run of Lesia Tsurenko, a 116th-ranked Ukrainian who only made it into the main draw as a lucky loser from the qualifiers. ""What can I say about Serena? There's so much to say -- she's just a great champion,"" the world No. 36 said of the Olympic and Wimbledon titleholder. Williams is seeking her 47th career title, already holding the record among active players -- her older sister Venus is second with 44. ""There's some chance, but with her power and the way she can serve, it will be difficult,"" Pavlyuchenkova said. Meanwhile, defending champion Andy Murray moved into the semifinals of the Brisbane men's event with a 6-4 7-6 (7-3) win over Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin on Friday. The world No. 3 will next play Japan's Kei Nishikori, who he beat in last year's Australian Open quarterfinals. Fifth seed Nishikori earned a semi spot by beating Alexandr Dolgopolov, the 2012 Brisbane runnerup. The other semifinal will be between 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus and 21-year-old Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, who upset Austrian seventh seed Jurgen Melzer. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will play in Saturday's final of the Hopman Cup teams event after he and Serbian playing partner Ana Ivanovic whitewashed Germany 3-0 in Perth on Friday. Djokovic thrashed veteran Tommy Haas 6-2 6-0 then former women's No. 1 Ivanovic -- whose injury in 2011 meant the pairing could not play in that year's final -- defeated Tatjana Malek 6-0 6-1 in just over half an hour. They also won the mixed doubles to complete a third successive victory in Group A and set up a clash with Spain's Fernando Verdasco and Anabel Medina Garrigues, who won all three of their Group B matches.","Victoria Azarenka battling to be fit for Australian Open after having minor surgery on toe .

"(CNN) -- Ted Ligety claimed his second gold of the world skiing championships Monday, lifting the U.S. to the top of the medals table in Austria. The 28-year-old from Salt Lake City produced a masterful performance over the two-legged super combined event for an aggregate time of two minutes 56.96 seconds. It left him 1.15 seconds faster than Croatian veteran Ivica Kostelic, with Romed Baumann, giving the hosts some rare cheer by taking the final podium spot. Ligety trailed Baumann by 0.72 seconds after the earlier downhill leg, but showed his all-round skills on the floodlit Planai slope at Schladming in the slalom. He edged inside the time set by Kostelic, then watched as a succession of challengers, including two-time defending champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, ski out in trying to match his time. Ligety was already celebrating when Baumann gave Austria just its second bronze of the championships. ""I surely took all the risks this evening after my great downhill run, I knew I had chance for another podium finish today,"" Ligety told the official championship website. ""These worlds have been pretty exciting for me so far. ""Now I'm looking forward for another great race in the coming giant slalom."" Ligety has stepped into the breach after the super-G crash which left fellow American Lindsey Vonn with season-ending injuries. Vonn was expected to lead the U.S. medal charge in Austria, but Ligety took the men's super-G title to compensate for her early exit -- his first ever major victory in that discipline. Svindal, the downhill winner, saw his chances go when he straddled a gate in the mid-section of a treacherous course, while Kostelic was disappointed he could not capitalize on a storming earlier run in the downhill. ""I didn't ski well at all this evening so I am very happy by that silver medal,"" he said. ""It's a lucky medal. I think I didn't deserve be on the podium after such as bad slalom run following that great downhill leg earlier today. "" Ligety will get a chance for a hat-trick of golds in Friday's giant slalom -- he won the title in 2011 in that discipline. The championships are an important staging post ahead of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi in a year's time.","Ted Ligety wins super-combi gold at world skiing championships .

"(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell tasted team success at September's Ryder Cup, but the former major winners have had to wait a long time for individual glory this year. That ended on Sunday as former world No. 1 Kaymer clinched his first tournament win since November 2011 and McDowell posted his first victory since 2010 in another exhibition tournament. ""I'm very happy to finally win this year, that was the most important thing for me because I was practicing very hard,"" Kaymer said after landing the $1.25 million first prize at the Nedbank Challenge in Sun City, South Africa. ""I played very well the last few weeks and months, but it just did not happen for me on the golf course."" The German finished two shots clear of South Africa's 2011 Masters winner Charl Schwartzel in a 12-man field that also included 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and former world No. 1 Lee Westwood. Kaymer followed up compatriot Bernhard Langer's victory in the seniors event in Sun City on Saturday. ""Bernhard has been a massive help for me. We talked at the Ryder Cup on the Saturday in the players' lounge when I didn't play at all, and we talked about the spirit and the attitude of the Ryder Cup, and you can use that for regular tournaments as well,"" Kaymer said. ""So he has been a huge influence for me. There was a bit more pressure today because everyone was talking about the German double. But I'm very fortunate that everything worked out for me, and it's obviously very nice from Bernhard that he called me straight away."" McDowell, meanwhile, upstaged Tiger Woods by winning the 14-time major champion's Chevron World Challenge event in California. The Northern Irishman, whose last victory came at the same tournament in 2010 after he also won the U.S. Open, finished three shots clear of last year's PGA Championship victor Keegan Bradley to claim the $1.2 million first prize. He was congratulated by compatriot Rory McIlroy, who last weekend ended his season as world No. 1 and leader of both the U.S. and European money lists. ""Great win @Graeme_McDowell!! They should rename that event the Gmac Challenge! Enjoy the well deserved break!"" McIlroy wrote on Twitter.

Now, she dispenses of anyone who takes her on within the walls of a squash court. Pakay, 18, is Pakistan's No. 1-ranked women's squash player. But what makes her story remarkable is that she hails from the country's tribal region of South Waziristan. The region, along the border with Afghanistan, is home to the Taliban. There, suicide attacks are a way of life. And the militants, bent on imposing a strict form of Islamic law, punish girls who attend school -- let alone play sports. ""They have no future,"" Pakay said. ""They spend their entire lives in four walls in their home. Their ability is destroyed."" But Pakay wasn't like most girls growing up. She sported a buzz cut and mixed with the boys. ""If someone argued with me, I used to beat them up,"" she said. ""I wanted them to obey me all the time."" Her father, Shams-ul-Qayum Wazir, knew early on that his daughter was different. ""I didn't want her talent to go to waste,"" he said. ""If I would've kept her in the village, all she could do was housekeeping.""  Watch Pakay talk about her life's mission » . So, Wazir packed up the family and moved to Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier Province. Here, Pakay picked up the racquet and swatted down the competition with ease -- first winning the Under-13 championship, then the Under-15, then the Under-17. In squash, players take turns hitting a ball to the front wall of a court, until one misses. Pakay, it turned out, rarely did. ""I thought nobody could beat me,"" she said. ""From the beginning when I played squash, I thought I could be a world champion."" Today, despite the lack of a sponsor and few resources, Pakay has gone pro -- and is ranked 91st in the world. Her father's sacrifice, she said, made her success possible. ""I think I have a great father -- so broad-minded,"" she said. For his part, Wazir -- a teacher -- was more circumspect. ""I sacrificed because I want to promote a message of peace,"" he said. ""If the tribal people pick up a racquet instead of a gun, there would be peace.""","Maria Toor Pakay, 18, is Pakistan's No. 1-ranked women's squash player .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has done it all in the world of golf. He has won 14 majors, topped the world rankings for a record 623 weeks in a row and enjoyed a lifestyle which the majority of people can only dream of. But it seems that the world's top-earning sportsman once thought about giving it all up -- to join the Navy. According to a book written by the 36-year-old's former coach Hank Haney, Woods seriously considered quitting golf to become a Navy SEAL. SEALs are the special operations arm of the U.S. Navy, so called because of their ability to operate in the sea, in the air or on land. According to Haney, Woods became infatuated with the idea of joining the specialized force. ""Tiger was seriously considering becoming a Navy SEAL,"" read an excerpt from Haney's forthcoming book on the website of Golf Digest. One of the magazine's journalists helped write the book. ""I didn't know how he'd go about it, but when he talked about it, it was clear he had a plan,"" Haney said. ""I thought, 'Wow, here is Tiger Woods, greatest athlete on the planet, maybe the greatest athlete ever, right in the middle of his prime, basically ready to leave it all behind for a military life.' "" The book is based on the six years Haney spent as Woods' swing coach, which ended in May 2010 after the former world No. 1 dropped out of the first round of the The Players Championship with a neck injury. Haney also revealed that in 2004 Woods went on a four-day special operations training course at Fort Bragg. ""Tiger did two tandem parachute jumps, engaged in hand-to-hand combat exercises, went on four-mile runs wearing combat boots, and did drills in a wind tunnel. Tiger loved it, but his physical therapist, Keith Kleven, went a little crazy worrying about the further damage Tiger might be doing to his left knee,"" he wrote. ""One morning I was in the kitchen when he came back from a long run around Isleworth, and I noticed he was wearing Army boots. Tiger admitted that he'd worn the heavy shoes before on the same route. 'I beat my best time,' he said."" Woods' agent Mark Steinberg rejected Haney's claims as ""armchair psychology."" He suggested Haney was twisting Woods' admiration for his late father, who was in the U.S. Army special forces. ""Because of his father, it's no secret that Tiger has always had high respect for the military,"" Steinberg said in a statement to the Orlando Sentinel. Haney also suggested Woods put pressure on himself to overhaul fellow American Jack Nicklaus' record total of 18 wins in golf's four major tournaments. ""He never mentioned Nicklaus' record, but it started to weigh more heavily at every major,"" read another excerpt from ""The Big Miss."" ""And Tiger's actions indicated he believed he had less time to do it than everyone thought."" Woods has not won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open, and is rebuilding his career following the scandal about his extramarital affairs which led to his divorce in 2010.","Tiger Woods' former coach suggests the golfer wanted to become a Navy SEAL .

"(CNN) -- Danica Patrick stunned the watching world at last month's Daytona 500 when she became the first female driver to claim pole position at any top-division NASCAR race. The American smashed yet another hole in the myth that motorsport is just for men -- and her achievements have not gone unnoticed by Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone, who wants her to challenge the likes of world champion Sebastian Vettel and title rival Fernando Alonso. ""There should be no reason why not, providing that we find a team to take her,"" Ecclestone said in an interview with the official F1 website. ""Danica would be good to have with one of the teams now. All the things that people worry about -- whether a woman can cope with the G-forces and all that -- she has proven that she can. ""She's been there and done it. What I think -- and I cannot blame her for it -- is that she will hardly want to give up the exposure she has in the U.S. to come here and maybe not make it. ""I have been looking for a woman for years! I always thought that this could be a good idea."" Ecclestone said he had discussed introducing women drivers with Dietrich Mateschitz, who owns the Red Bull team that has dominated F1 for the past three years. ""I spoke with Didi Mateschitz some time ago about the issue of an American team and at that time I said that we would want an American woman driver. He seems ready,"" the 82-year-old said. Patrick, 30, is currently enjoying her first full year as a NASCAR Sprint Cup driver after racing open-wheel IndyCars for several years. She is the leading female driver in motorsport, but has not given any indication of moving over to the world of Formula One. The last woman to race an F1 car was Lella Lombardi back in 1976. The Italian, who drove for March, Williams and RAM, is the only female driver in F1 history to have recorded a top-six finish. More recently, women have been employed as test drivers -- such as Maria de Villota, whose career at the Marussia team was cut short by an accident last year. The Spaniard, the daughter of a motor racing driver, was considered an excellent prospect and was well respected within the Formula One circuit. But her career was curtailed in July 2012 when the MR-01 race car she was driving hit a support truck and left her with serious head and facial injuries, losing sight in one eye. Since de Villota's accident, Scotland's Susie Wolff has been grabbing the headlines. The 30-year-old works as a developmental driver for the Williams team -- quite a leap from the eight-year-old who started off go-karting. But she still faces a challenge to follow in the pioneering tire marks of Lombardi and Maria Teresa de Filippis -- the first woman to compete in F1, racing five times between 1958 and 1959.","Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone wants more women in the sport .

"(CNN) -- FIFA wants to enlist the help of Kevin-Prince Boateng and other high-profile stars from the world of soccer to help drive racism out of football. AC Milan's Boateng left the field in a match against Italian fourth tier side Pro Patria in January after suffering racist abuse from the crowd, sparking further debate on whether enough was being done to tackle the problem. Football's governing body joined forces with the United Nations Thursday to explore ways of combating discrimination and they said top players like Boateng can play a vital role. Boateng, an ex-Ghana international, is due to meet Sepp Blatter on Friday and the FIFA president penned a speech that was presented to the U.N. on International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It read: ""When a player has to choose between leaving the field of play to make a statement against racism or staying on the pitch and tolerating the intolerable, we know the football community has fallen short of its obligations to protect its members. ""Despite the many victories we have won in football against discrimination and prejudice, we know we still have a problem today and we know more has to change. ""We have to step up our efforts, to keep fighting. We at FIFA supported Kevin Prince-Boateng for making that principled, brave stand. But we all know it was not a solution. It was a wake-up call. No player should have to make that choice. ""We, within the footballing community, now need a watertight commitment from grassroots to international level to better enforce FIFA's tough anti-discrimination regulations. ""And we hope to work with Kevin and other high-profile figures in the game to root out racism once and for all."" Boateng's actions drew a mixed response but it undoubtedly highlighted the issue and now he is hoping to assist FIFA in their anti-racism work. He told the conference about his decision to leave the field: ""Normally, this shouldn't be the thing to do. FIFA is pushing very hard. Generally speaking, yes, players shouldn't walk off. ""But I hope the authorities will now take concrete action in the fight against racism."" Former Arsenal and France captain Patrick Vieira was also at the U.N. conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and he told FIFA's official website the fight was moving in the right direction. Racism continues to blight soccer with several incidents making headlines in the past calendar year, aside from Boateng's walk off. Recently, Inter Milan was charged by European football's governing body UEFA for racist chanting towards Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who plays for English club Tottenham. Last month, Inter was fined $65,500 by the Italian football authorities after its fans were found guilty of racially abusing former players Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari, who now play alongside Boateng at rivals AC Milan. Fellow Italian club Lazio was hit with a $52,000 fine in February by UEFA for several offenses, including a fourth charge of racist behavior this season. Serbia was ordered to play one under-21 match behind closed doors and was fined $105,000 by UEFA for racial abuse in a match with England. UEFA president Michel Platini has appealed the verdict of his organization in the hope of seeing stiffer punishments administered. Chelsea and England captain John Terry was charged by UK police after allegedly making racist remarks to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Terry was cleared of the charges in a London court in July 2012. FIFA also moved to clarify comments made by Blatter in the Spanish media on the possibility of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar being moved from their summer to winter. Blatter reportedly told newspaper AS that FIFA's executive committee must accept the criticism it is now receiving for their decision to choose Qatar as host, with concerns mounting over player safety due to excessive heat and humidity in the country. FIFA said any question on moving the tournament would have to come from the Qatari organizers and as it stands the World Cup is still scheduled for June or July in 2022. Blatter told AS: ""Any request for change must come from Qatar. But they have not made this request yet, because they know that if they do so, the other bidders could say 'ah, there is a change.'"" On the question of whether the vote could be repeated he added: ""I don't know, I don't know. This is a hypothetical scenario. In this moment, the organizers from Qatar have confirmed to us that they can organize the World Cup in summer."" Brazil and Italy drew 2-2 in an entertaining international friendly match in Switzerland. Goals from Fluminese striker Fred and Chelsea midfielder Oscar had put Brazil into a 2-0 lead at halftime. But Daniele De Rossi pulled a goal back for Italy soon after the break before AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli scored with a fine strike from range to seal a 2-2 draw.","FIFA to work with players like Kevin-Prince Boateng in fight against racism .

"(CNN) -- ""Any time you're around greatness, like I was for six years, and you see it at close quarters, you're asked about it."" Tiger Woods' former swing coach Hank Haney says it happens wherever he goes. With the former world No. 1 back in the headlines for the right reasons, the publication of ""The Big Miss: My Years Coaching Tiger Woods"" is Haney's chance to tell a few more people. Haney joined Woods' team in 2004 and knew he'd ""catch some flack"" for penning the book, but he wanted to share his memories of a person he describes as very complex. ""I mean very, very complex. He's an incredible champion. You know, he's different. But I expected that,"" Haney told CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight. ""I mean, when you see somebody that's as great as Tiger Woods, there's probably a reason for it. And you wouldn't expect him to be the same as everyone else."" Haney spent over 100 days in the company of Woods every year, even staying at his Florida home on occasions. With regular phone conversations, it amounted to the closest relationship Haney has ever had with a player. But they were never really close, according to Haney. ""Tiger is pretty closed off. You don't really get a lot of communication from him, or deep conversations,"" he said. The book reflects ""exactly what happened"" during their time together right down to publication of some text messages Haney sent to Woods. ""I feel like I've been a great friend to you. I don't feel like I've gotten that in return,"" reads one. It's a move which has come in for criticism from some fellow coaches. Rick Smith, former coach of Phil Mickelson, recently said: ""I'd rather be broke and not have a penny to my name before I violate the code of player/teacher confidentiality. For all the guys who've committed their lives to teaching, this should be very upsetting."" But Haney rejects charges of betrayal saying the book is honest and fair. ""Those rules are not written rules. Those might be rules that Rick and obviously some other people think are rules. But I wasn't bound by any agreement. I didn't violate any agreement,"" Haney said. The ""great friend"" text was sent when he resigned and reflects what Haney believes to be the truth. ""I always gave an answer that was in the best interest of Tiger Woods. And I didn't feel like that happened in return,"" Haney said. But there wasn't one single thing which made him want to terminate their relationship. ""We had a great time together. Tiger won a lot of tournaments. He won 45% of his tournaments the last three years I worked with him,"" Haney said. ""It was just time for me to go. You know, I had a great time. It was the greatest opportunity a coach or teacher could have. I'm very thankful for it."" Haney was ""shocked"" when the scandal about Woods' personal life broke in November 2009. ""I didn't know anything. Steve Williams, his caddy, didn't know anything. And obviously Elin, Tiger's wife at the time, didn't know anything,"" he said. ""I don't think it would be my place necessarily as a coach (to have said something), but it would be my place, I feel like, as a friend. I certainly would have said something and I know Steve Williams would have said something too."" Haney detects that a post-scandal Woods may have ""softened"" but says he's getting back to his best. ""He's definitely striking the ball well. I mean, he finished first in greens in regulation, which for the years that I worked with Tiger, I thought that was a key statistic. He was always first in greens in regulation, or near the top."" But it's his recent improvement on the greens which Haney thinks will be key to success in the coming weeks. ""The great thing about Bay Hill to me was that his putting was good. He finished fourth in putting. That's a key statistic. Every player that's won on the PGA tour this year has finished top 10 in putting,"" he said. ""And going to Augusta, that's the most important thing. Tiger would have won five or six green jackets in a row if he would have fewer than, you know, two three-putts for the 72 holes. ""So if he can avoid three-putts at Augusta, he'll be very difficult to beat. He's great on that golf course. It fits his game."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- Weeks after Lance Armstrong's startling admission that he used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his cycling career, the world of sport has been rocked by explosive new allegations about cheating in sports-mad Australia. On Thursday, the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) published the findings of a year-long investigation that claimed the use of banned substances such as growth stimulants was ""widespread"" among professional athletes across a range of sports there. In many instances, the report said, the substances are not yet approved for human use. In its conclusion, the ACC said there are clear parallels between what has been discovered in Australia and the US Anti-Doping Agency investigation into Armstrong -- who was recently stripped of his seven Tour de France titles -- underlining the transnational threat posed by doping to professional sport. The report stressed that it is not just athletes that are involved, but their support staff, doctors and organized criminal elements. What is doping? It involves an athlete taking drugs or blood products to artificially boost their performance during training and competition. What substances are we talking about here? The ACC report identified an evolving market in a new generation of Performance and Image Enhancing Drugs (PIEDs) -- known as peptides and hormones. According to the ACC, some of these substances are perceived by athletes to be undetectable, making them attractive to those seeking to gain an unfair advantage. -- Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides . ""Peptides"" stimulate the release of an increased level of human growth hormone (hGh), making them popular among athletes and body builders to promote muscle growth. They are also used in combination with anabolic steroids -- which also promote size and strength -- to maintain muscle gain. They are sold as a cream or in a solution for injection. While some peptide supplements are perfectly legal as a recovery aid after exercise, growth-stimulating peptides are classified as a prohibited substance on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and therefore are banned for use by professional athletes in and out of competition. -- Growth Hormone Variants . The report also identified the use of AOD-9604, a variant of growth hormone with fat-burning properties often taken by athletes to increase their power. Clinical trials suggest it may even help to repair and enhance muscle formation, according to the ACC report and WADA. AOD-9604 is not prohibited by WADA. -- Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) Like anabolic steroids, SARMs build strength, bone density and muscle mass by stimulating the body's androgen receptor, which itself boosts the uptake of testosterone -- the main male hormone -- into cells. SARMs have a lower risk of side effects normally associated with the prolonged use of anabolic steroids, such as high blood pressure, liver damage, depression, baldness, the development of male characteristics in females and the development of breast tissue in males. According to ACC report, SARMs are often used in combination with other PIEDs, including hGh. SARMs are a prohibited substance for elite athletes both in and out of competition under WADA rules. -- InsulIn-lIke growth factors (IGF-1) IGF-1 is one of the primary hormones necessary for cell growth in the body. Many athletes use IGF-1 for its anabolic effect in muscle and to facilitate the development of cartilage and bone. In many cases, athletes will use hGh and IGF-1 in small doses to reduce the chances of returning a positive anti-doping sample, the ACC report says. IGF-1 is also banned by WADA. -- Mechano growth factor (MGF) A variant of IGF-1, MGF leads to an increase in the muscle cells necessary for adult muscles to continue growth beyond their genetic limit. It is often used by bodybuilders due to its role in muscle repair following exercise. Banned under WADA rules, MGF is also illegal to possess in many countries without a prescription. -- Other substances . The ACC report also identified a number of other performance-enhancing substances -- some being prescription only medicines: . Ipamorelin and Sermorelin -- both peptides with anabolic effects, which are both prohibited by WADA. Follistatin -- Promotes muscle growth. Banned by WADA, with its possession without legal authority is illegal. Thymosin -- Used to speed up recovery from injury, it is an unregulated substance banned by WADA.","Australian Crime Commission finds evidence of ""widespread use"" of doping in sports .

The Shockers and Cardinals battled through a tight, low-scoring first half that ended with Wichita State going into the intermission with a slim 26-25 advantage. Louisville's 72-68 win means that its head coach, Rick Pitino, still is in contention to win his second national championship -- the other coming in 1996, when he coached the Cardinals' archrival, the University of Kentucky. The game also ended Wichita State's remarkable tournament run. The No. 9 seed in the West region beat top-seed Gonzaga and then Ohio State to earn a spot in the Final Four.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Asia is set to have the world's wealthiest residents, with city-state Singapore heading the rich list. Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea will do well, too, according to by a new survey that predicts which countries will be home to the wealthiest citizens by 2050. By one measure, they are already are. Singapore's per capita income is estimated by Knight Frank and Citi Private Wealth's 2012 Wealth Report to be the highest in the world at $56,532 in 2010, measured by purchasing power parity. Norway follows at $51,226, then the U.S. ($45,511), Hong Kong ($45,301) and Switzerland ($42,470). (The International Monetary Fund listed Singapore 3rd in the world in 2010-11 by per capita GDP, behind Qatar and Luxembourg, which weren't included in the Knight Frank report). By 2050, the Wealth Report estimates the world's wealthy citizens will be dominated by Asia: Singapore ($137,710), Hong Kong ($116,639), Taiwan ($114,093) and South Korea ($107,752). The only western economy projected to remain in the top five is the U.S., with an estimated per capita income of $100,802. Danny Quah of the London School of Economics predicts that by 2050, the world's economic center of gravity will be somewhere between India and China, the report notes. In 1980, the global economic center lay in the middle of the Atlantic. Some of the world's super-rich have already crossed the Pacific. Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, a native of Brazil, moved to Singapore in 2009 has since renounced his U.S. citizenship. Jim Rogers, the co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros, also moved to the former British colony in 2007. ""I have moved -- I have sold my house in New York. I have moved to Asia and my girls speak Mandarin, speak perfect Mandarin ... I'm preparing them for the 21st century by knowing Asia and by speaking perfect Mandarin,"" Rogers told CNN recently. ""It's easier to get rich in Asia than it is in America now. The wind is in your face. (The U.S.) is the largest debtor nation in the history of the world,"" Rogers added. ""The largest creditor nations in the world are China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore. The assets are in Asia. You know who the debtors are and where they are. Look at Greece. Look at Spain. I mean, I don't like saying this. You know, I'm an American, too. But facts are facts."" The report's list of fastest growing economies between 2010 and 2050 also gives more credence that the world's wealth is moving toward Asia. Of the top 10 fastest rising economies -- Nigeria, India, Iraq, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Egypt, respectively -- all but three are in the region. Old World economies will have the worst growth performance in the next 40 years, the report predicts: Spain, France, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany are at the bottom of the list. But Japan and its aging population will have the weakest projected growth of all economies, Knight Frank estimates. However, just because the denizens of Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are projected to live in the world's wealthiest regions doesn't mean all will share in the wealth. In the report Tina Fordham, Senior Global Political Analyst at Citi, warns that the dissatisfaction with income inequality shown in the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations ""will gain momentum, and that there could be a long-term recalibration between governments, businesses and society as a result."" On Monday, a court ordered the protesters of Occupy Central in Hong Kong, one of the last outposts of the global protests sparked by Occupy Wall Street, to give up its encampment at HSBC's headquarters in the city.

"(CNN) -- David Beckham was a key figure in London's drive to win hosting rights for the 2012 Olympics, and now the sports icon is taking on the challenge of boosting the image of China's troubled soccer industry. The world's most populous nation has recruited the veteran Paris Saint-Germain midfielder as a global ambassador to help promote the Chinese game both at home and abroad as it combats a serious image problem caused by recent match-fix scandals and the premature departure of two high-profile foreign imports. According to a statement released by Beckham's management, the Chinese Football Association was drawn to the former England captain's ""credibility as one of the most admired sportsmen and iconic figures in the world as well as his outstanding sportsmanship and professionalism."" ""I am honored to have been asked to play such an important role at this special time in Chinese football history,"" declared 37-year-old Beckham, who is a worldwide celebrity following stints with Manchester United and Real Madrid in addition to his high-profile off-pitch endorsement deals. ""I'm excited by the prospect of promoting the world's greatest game to Chinese sports fans as I've seen firsthand the growing interest in football there,"" added Beckham, who also spent five years in Los Angeles with his former popstar wife Victoria and their four children. ""This is a wonderful sport that inspires people across the world and brings families together, so I'm relishing the opportunity of introducing more fans to the game."" Beckham's appointment coincides with the 20th anniversary of professional football in China, which is home to 1.3 billion people. ""We are pleased to invite Mr. Beckham to visit China at this special moment,"" said a CFA official, who was not named. ""While in China, he will attend the Chinese Super League (CSL) and visit clubs to get a deeper insight into football in China. ""He will also help us to inspire and motivate many children to participate in this beautiful game."" Beckham will hope to improve the reputation of Chinese football, which has been blighted by numerous scandals. Last month Shanghai Shenhua was stripped of the CSL title it won in 2003 as part of a crackdown on match-fixing which also saw 33 lifetime bans from the sport handed out. ""There has been major corruption in the past but there have been some severe punishments of late,"" Asian football writer John Duerden told CNN. ""Consequently, the situation seems to be much better. The game is cleaner and sponsors and fans have returned. ""It is hard to say that is completely clean but recent events have shown that no country can say with any certainty that it is free of corruption."" Shanghai made headlines around the world after embarking on a recruitment drive which included the signings of strikers Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea, which won the European Champions League last season. But the two transfers have not been the success Shenhua had hoped, despite paying both players more than $200,000 a week. Drogba recently signed an 18-month contract with Turkish club Galatasaray after just 10 months in China, while Anelka joined Italian champions Juventus on a five-month loan deal in January. ""It put China in the international news and excited fans back home,"" Duerden said of the duo's move to Shanghai last year. ""It was good for the brand of the country's football, especially at home. Other stars followed in their footsteps ... the two just went to the wrong club, perhaps the worst-run club in China."" Despite recent controversies and the departures -- both permanent and temporary -- of Anelka and Drogba, Duerden suggests the reputation and popularity of the CSL is on the rise. ""The popularity of the Chinese Super League is growing,"" he said. ""There is a lot of money there, the facilities are good and the attendances are the highest in Asia. There's still a long way to go but it's growing."" Part of Beckham's new role will be to encourage China's youth to embrace soccer at a time when the country's government is attempting to grow the sport. ""In schools, a massive program has just started to help train Chinese kids for the first time,"" Duerden said. ""It is a systematic approach and well-funded. It remains to be seen how successful it is but it certainly can't do any harm.""","Soccer star David Beckham appointed ambassador for Chinese football .

"London (CNN) -- Andrei Filatov, chess expert and Russian billionaire, is turning his hand to a new business: Soviet-era art. Filatov, a 40-year old professional chess player and businessman, is investing in his love of Soviet Union art by scouting the world for pieces created behind the Iron Curtain. The Ukrainian-born businessman, valued by Forbes at $1.3 billion and ranked as Russia's 68th richest person, has invested heavily in Russian infrastructure through his co-ownership of N-Trans Group. But over the last five years, he has spent $100 million collecting Soviet artworks, hoping to gather enough to eventually open a museum. Filatov's pieces -- including 1951's ""A Letter from the Front,"" by Alexander Laktionov, 1930's ""Daisies"" by Nicolai Fechin and 1893's ""Comrades"" by Philip Maliavin -- have been collected from around the world, where they were scattered to gather dust after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1991. ""When the Soviet Union collapsed, a huge amount of great artworks were taken out of the country to the west and elsewhere,"" Filatov says. ""My task is to buy these artworks and show them to people."" Laktionov is one of the Soviet Union's most famed painters of the so-called socialist realist genre, which was sponsored by the state. He was commissioned by the USSR's communist leader Joseph Stalin to create ""A Letter from the Front,"" a warm depiction of a family receiving news from the front line. The original piece, painted in 1947, won the Stalin Prize and remains in the Tretyakov State Gallery in Moscow. Filatov's version, painted after Stalin requested a second version of the artwork to show to the world, was found by chance in the Bahamas by his art dealer, Rena Lavery. Despite being critiqued as propaganda for its representations of life under Stalin's dictatorship, socialist realism has enjoyed a renaissance as those living in former Soviet countries seek artifacts from the previous era. For Filatov, ""A Letter from the Front"" reminds him of his grandfather Alexey Pushkar, who died in 1943 as the Soviets fought the Germans in the bloody battles of the Eastern Front. He won't reveal how much the artwork cost but says it is an ""emotional painting"" that allows him to imagine what it must have been like waiting for news from loved ones during wartime. Filatov was a student in Minsk when the Soviet Union fell and recalls being stunned by the news that his country didn't exist anymore. It was a ""love for the lost motherland,"" that prompted him to start collecting the era's art. Filatov says he is ""aware of what kind of empire I lived in, that many times this empire, the leaders put the world at risk of world war."" But, he adds, ""you can't not recognize the achievements of the Soviet Union. So I believe that the most important thing here is an objective view of the achievements, and the experience of that short and bright empire."" Lavery points to the technical achievements of the artists in fields such as realism and impressionism, despite living under a repressive regime. ""The artworks are reflections of the time and that era of a country that doesn't exist any more,"" she says. Filatov wants to collect up to 12 new artworks a year, primarily from the period 1917 to 1991, for the Filatov Family Art Fund. He intends to loan the pieces to museums and art galleries, exhibit and promote around the world. Filatov has previously merged his love of chess and art by sponsoring this year's World Chess Championship Match at Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. Filatov says he will continue to invest in art as long as his business -- which he built up in the 1990s and now straddles shipping, ports and infrastructure -- allows. And despite his interest in the past, Filatov says Russians have never ""lived more freely or prosperously than today. Never have our people been so free, not only in movement but in political choice.""","Andrei Filatov, chess expert and Russian billionaire, is turning his hand to a new business .

"(CNN) -- Former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is backing Borussia Dortmund to cause a shock and win the European Champions League. Schmeichel captained United to European club football's biggest prize in 1999 and believes Jurgen Klopp's German champions have the ability clinch Europe's premier competition. ""I'm looking at Dortmund this time,"" the Dane, who skippered United as they secured a dramatic 2-1 win over Bayern Munich 13 years ago, told CNN, ahead of Thursday's last -16 draw. ""They've surprised everyone; they've put everything they have into the Champions League. ""They're behind in the league, as champions, which is not great, but they play exciting football. I think they have one of the managers for the future; the big clubs will certainly try and get him."" Klopp has led Dortmund to back-to-back German titles and guided the 1997 Champions League winners to the top of a group which contained Real Madrid, Manchester City and Ajax after failing to reach the knockout stages last season. ""I think we'll get a surprise this year and I'm leaning a little bit towards Dortmund,"" continued Schmeichel. ""They play such a great game which fits the Champions League. Maybe we will have a surprise winner."" In addition to Dortmund, Schmeichel also talked up the chances of Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona. The Catalan side have won all but one of their Spanish League matches and, in Lionel Messi, possess a player who has scored a record 90 goals in 2012. Blog: Is Barca's Vilanova coach of the year? However, Schmeichel suggested Barca's opponents could take heart from Chelsea's defeat of the four-time European champions at the semifinal stage last season. ""We know how to stop Barcelona now because we saw what Chelsea did,"" said the former Danish international keeper. ""It requires a little bit of luck and Chelsea had that, but I don't think you can beat Barcelona over two games without having played well. ""You could see the confusion of the Barca players -- they didn't have a plan B and I think you need to have that. ""You need to have more than one style of playing in the Champions League and I think that's why it is interesting to follow Barcelona -- how are they going to react now? But Barcelona will always be the team to beat."" By way of comparision, Schmeichel feels that Real Madrid have a coach in Jose Mourinho who can adapt a team to any situation. Real have endured a torrid start to the La Liga season and sit 13 points off table-toppers Barca, but Schmeichel suggests Mourinho could be the man to lead Real to a much-coveted 10th European crown. ""We've seen this with Mourinho when he was at Chelsea and Inter Milan,"" added Schmeichel. ""They are very, very hot and then they are cold. But when it comes to the Champions League and Mourinho, it is a guarantee they will be there or thereabouts because he's a master in that tournament. ""With Mourinho there is a plan B, a plan C, you can carry on. He can set his team up in so many different ways."" If United is the club which remains closest to Schmeichel's heart, the Dane argues manager Sir Alex Ferguson needs to find a quick solution to a defense which has shipped 30 goals in 23 league and Champions League matches. ""We have been defending terribly this year and even Alex is out there now publicly stating we have to improve,"" admitted Schmeichel. ""Every game we have to score three goals to win the game, you're under too much pressure. ""Three goals is a lot to score in the Champions League, I'm not saying its impossible but at this stage of the competition, it is really tough. You have to stop conceding."" Schmeichel hopes the recent return of defender Nemanja Vidic, who has suffered an injury-ravaged 12 months, will help shore up United's shaky backline. ""He's basically been out for a year. He came back against Sunderland, it was great to see him there and we're all hoping he is going to be the player he was. We need him for his leadership, but we need him for his defending as well.""","Peter Schmeichel forecasts Borussia Dortmund to win the European Champions League .

"(CNN) -- With 182 Formula One wins, McLaren is one of the most successful marques in the history of the sport, but F1's second oldest team could be waiting some time for the next victory. So much so, that after the team's stuttering start to the new F1 season last weekend, McLaren drivers Jenson Button and Sergio Perez have already ruled themselves out of winning Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix. The 2009 world champion Button won three races last season and after Lewis Hamilton left McLaren to join Mercedes he must have been relishing the chance to launch a title challenge as the team's No. 1 driver. However the Briton, who finished ninth at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, is expecting another frustrating weekend in Kuala Lumpur. ""Australia was obviously a tough weekend and, despite getting the maximum out of the car, it's still clearly not where we want to be,"" Button told the sport's official website. ""There's a lot of work to be done but we all know that this team won't stop working until they get it right. For this weekend, I don't think we can expect an improvement in our fortunes, but the thing about Malaysia is that it can be so unpredictable."" Like all Englishmen, Button is closely watching the weather forecast in the hope that McLaren might profit from what could be a wet race at the Sepang International Circuit to even up the odds for the British team. ""We saw that last year, when Fernando (Alonso) won, and we know that the unpredictable weather can make it a lottery for everyone,"" added Button. ""That's something that could play into our hands -- I do enjoy driving in changeable conditions, and would love the challenge of being able to run competitively in a car that we all know is not quite capable of challenging for victories yet."" Perez, who made his debut for McLaren last weekend after joining the British marque from Sauber, delivered an equally sombre assessment of the team's problems. ""Last weekend's race was a difficult one for everybody on the team, but it's shown us exactly what we need to do to close down the gap to the leaders,"" said the 23-year-old Mexican, who finished second in Malaysia last season, . ""This weekend in Malaysia will be about trying to maximise the package we have while knowing that it's not going to be enough to allow us to fight for overall victory. ""Sepang holds many happy memories -- I had one of the best races of my career there last year where I was able to push Alonso for victory until the closing laps. The Circuit: CNN's F1 interactive . ""It's a fantastic circuit, really fast and demanding. It would be great to pull off another unexpected result for the team this year."" Mercedes optimism . Former McLaren driver Hamilton enjoyed a solid first race for Mercedes last weekend, finishing fifth after starting the race third on the grid, and the 2008 world champion has been pleasantly buoyed by his team's performance in Melbourne. ""I feel very optimistic,"" Hamilton was reported to have said by AFP. ""I came away from there with 10 points and I feel really happy with 10 points because when I made the switch I didn't know where we'd be, and I definitely didn't think we'd come away from the first race with 10 points."" Hamilton is confident he can match the pace of Red Bull's triple world champion Sebastian Vettel. ""I don't think they (Red Bull) had frightening pace in qualifying,"" continued the 28-year-old Briton. ""I think if I was out at the same time, if I was out as late as they had gone out, I think I could have matched their time. ""But then we got to the race and they had great pace again, as they always do and he (Vettel) disappeared, along with everyone else. Hopefully in the next race we won't have that problem."" Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen is the top of the drivers' rankings following the first race after the 2007 world champion took the checkered flag at Albert Park in Melbourne. But the Finn denied suggestions he will be the man everyone is looking to beat in Sunday's race. ""There's no target (on my back),"" said the 32-year-old. ""We're not doing any different things this week from what we did previously. ""So whether people think we are the leaders makes no difference to how we work, what we're going to do this weekend or any other weekend. We'll try to do our best and hopefully we can score some good points.""","Jenson Button and Sergio Perez say McLaren will not compete in Malaysia .

"(CNN) -- The evening was supposed to be about remembering former England and West Ham captain Bobby Moore, who died 20 years ago, but in the end it was Gareth Bale who provided the memories at Upton Park with another unforgettable display. The Welshman scored twice, with his second coming in the 90th minute, as Tottenham Hotspur came from behind to win 3-2 at West Ham and move up to third in the Premier League. Bale, who has now scored eight of his team's last ten goals in all competitions, was the main talking point at the final whistle but the game kicked off with the thoughts of England's only World Cup-winning captain uppermost in spectators' minds. The former defender, who died on 24 February 1993 at the age of 51, was honored as fans and players from both clubs provided a minute's applause, with home supporters creating a mosaic reading ""Moore 6"" in the stand named after him. His three grandchildren -- Poppy, 21, Freddie, 16 and Ava, 13 -- had led the teams out as they carried the match ball onto the pitch. ""Twenty years gone, never forgotten"" were the words that not only beamed out of the stadium's giant television screens but were also stitched into the jerseys of the West Ham players. Having joined his local club as a teenager, Moore became a legend for a side he represented between 1958 and 1974, winning the FA Cup in 1964 and then the Cup Winners' Cup (a competition eligible for those European sides that had won their domestic cup) a year later. Yet it was his displays with England in 1966 that cemented his place in football folklore for a defender rated as one of the best to have ever played the game. ""It was Bobby's ultimate goal to play for England,"" Moore's wife Stephane told the English FA's website. ""I remember him saying to me one day when we went to the old Wembley, 'You have no idea what it feels like to walk onto that pitch, it's like levitating'. ""It meant everything to him to represent his country at Wembley."" On 30 July 1966, Moore's dreams came true as England won the World Cup on home soil, defeating great rivals Germany in the final at Wembley -- outside of which a statue of their former captain proudly stands today. West Ham played a lead role in England's success, with Moore captaining the side, forward Geoff Hurst scoring a hat-trick (still the only player to do so in a World Cup final) and midfielder Martin Peters grabbing the home side's only other goal. Four years later, as England tried to defend their trophy in Mexico, Moore led his team's resistance against Brazil in the group stages -- playing so well that the legendary Pele, whose team went on to win the trophy that year, singled him out for praise. ""Of the hundreds of defenders who played against me during my career I pick Bobby Moore as the greatest of them all,"" the FA website quoted Pele, the only player to have won three World Cup trophies, as saying. Moore, who died from cancer, was also praised for his fine sportsmanship -- with a photo of himself and Pele greeting one another with mutual respect after their Mexican clash, which Brazil won 1-0, coming to symbolize what football's soul should be about for many. The defender wore the number 6 shirt for both club and country and the reason there was no West Ham player sporting that digit on the back of their jersey against Tottenham is that the club retired the shirt five years ago in memory of Moore. After six minutes, there was another commemoration for a player who had a brief spell with another London club, Fulham, late in his career as applause broke out around the ground but soon after, it was Bale who stole the show. The 23-year-old pounced upon a defensive error from West Ham to fire home from the edge of the box but the visitors' advantage was nullified as Andy Carroll won -- and then scored -- a penalty. Just before the hour, West Ham fans began to think that the tribute to Moore would be crowned in fitting style as Joe Cole gave the home side the lead -- while at the other end, goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen was pulling off a string of fine saves. He could not prevent Gylffi Sigurdsson equalizing 14 minutes from time however, so creating the platform for Bale to score a stunning winner as he lashed a strike into the top corner from 30 yards. The win represented a crucial three points in Tottenham's bid to qualify for next year's Champions League, with Spurs leaping above Chelsea and, more importantly for some, going four points clear of rivals Arsenal -- who they host in Sunday's North London derby. Elsewhere in Europe, second-placed Napoli were held to a 0-0 draw at Udinese, leaving them six points behind Serie A leaders Juventus.","Gareth Bale scores twice as Spurs come from behind to win 3-2 at West Ham .

"(CNN) -- I'll Have Another, the winner of this year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, is out of Saturday's Belmont Stakes because of a leg injury and has been retired from racing, his team said. Trainer Doug O'Neill said the 3-year-old colt began developing tendonitis in his left foreleg. He called the development ""freakish."" ""Yesterday, he galloped great, but the afternoon we noticed some loss of definition in his left front leg to which, like every other owner and trainer, we prayed he just kind of hit himself and it was just a little bit of skin irritation. ""We did him up in a special poultice. This morning, he looked great, so I thanked the racing gods there, and we did just a little easy gallop with him today. I thought he looked great on the track, and then cooling out, you could tell that swelling was back and at that back, I didn't feel very good."" Animal welfare activists: Horse racing industry needs reform . O'Neill got a veterinarian to examine the horse, and he determined the injury was ""the start of tendonitis in his left front tendon."" O'Neill said the horse could have rested for several months and got started again. But he said I'll Have Another has ""done so much that it was unanimous"" among the owners and trainers ""to retire him."" ""It is a bummer,"" O'Neill said. ""Far from tragic, but it is very disappointing."" J. Paul Reddam, the owner, thanked his training team and said, ""it was a hell of a run."" ""I know they're all personally very disappointed, of course, that he didn't get to show his stuff."" The coulda, woulda, shoulda Triple Crown winners . Reddam thought the horse, purchased last year for $35,000, would race and ""really show something."" ""So we were all a bit shocked, but we have to do what's best for the horse, and if he can't compete at the top level, you know, he's done enough,"" Reddam said. The colt and jockey Mario Gutierrez would have made a run for horse racing's first Triple Crown in 34 years. Since 1990, only seven horses have won the first two legs of the title. Gutierrez and I'll Have Another will lead the post parade for the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, the New York Racing Association said. I'll Have Another was ""lightly raced"" and competed in only two prep races leading up to the Derby. He competed in the shadow of Bodemeister, who was predicted to win the Kentucky Derby. SI: Scratch at Belmont another big blow to racing . The horse's only disappointing appearance was at Saratoga for the Hopeful Stakes in September. The Belmont is considered to be the longest and most grueling of the three Triple Crown races. The horses run one complete lap over 1Â½ miles. The Derby is 1Â¼ miles, and the Preakness is 1 and 3/16 miles. The Triple Crown did not acquire its name until Sir Barton won all three races in 1919. Just 11 horses have won the prestigious honor, most recently in 1978, when Affirmed grabbed the title. Only two other Derby and Preakness winners were unable to run in the final leg of the Triple Crown: Burgoo King in 1932 and Bold Venture in 1936. Three decades stand out as having multiple Triple Crown winners: the 1930s with three winners, the 1940s with four and the 1970s with three, most notably Secretariat in 1973. Secretariat also set the world record in 1973, winning the Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths and running the course in 2 minutes, 24 seconds. Overheard on CNN.com: If wishes were horses, 'Another' Secretariat would rise . Since the 1970s, a few horses have come close to winning the Triple Crown. In 2004, the largest crowd in New York Racing history, 120,139 people, attended the Belmont to see Smarty Jones attempt the 12th Triple Crown win. Smarty Jones finished second. In 2003, favored Funny Cide finished third in his attempt. Most recently, Big Brown's Triple Crown hopes were dashed in 2008. The scratch leaves a field of 11 in which Dullahan, the third-place finisher in the Kentucky Derby, is the new morning-line favorite. Dale Romans, Dullahan's trainer, called the news ""devastating."" ""I thought it was going to be one of the biggest races in history, and we wanted him to be a part of it,"" Romans said. The race will take place at approximately 6:30 p.m. ET at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. SI: Photos from Triple Crown near misses . The time leading up to the Belmont Stakes has not been without controversy. A workers strike at Belmont Park was averted this week. The racetrack's workers, who manage the grounds and put the horses in the gate, have been involved in a contract dispute with the New York Racing Association over wages and health care since 2010. I'll Have Another's trainer will begin his 45-day suspension, handed down by the California horse-racing authorities, on July 1. O'Neill was found responsible for high carbon dioxide levels in 2010 California Del Mar track racer Argenta's blood. However, he was not found guilty of ""intentional acts"" or any sign that betting was skewed toward Argenta in the race. Despite that, O'Neill was still able to participate in the Stakes this weekend. After the news of I'll Have Another's scratch, New York Racing Association Chairman Steven Duncker said he was disappointed for fans and the sport of thoroughbred racing. ""But the most important concern is always the health and well being of the horses. Although there will not be a Triple Crown coronation, we are still looking forward to what will be a terrific day of racing at Belmont Park,"" he said. CNN's Ashley Strickland and Richard Roth contributed to this report.","Owner says, ""it was a hell of a run""

"(CNN) -- Her story reads like the plot of a Hollywood movie: the little filly considered too small to race is now widely hailed as the best thoroughbred Germany has ever produced. Danedream may not have the celebrity status of Australia's Black Caviar or the awe-inspiring invincibility of England's Frankel, but here, in the land of her birth, they could not be prouder of German racing's most famous daughter. Danedream first came to the world's attention when she captured last year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Europe's most prestigious race, beating a strong international field -- and the course record -- in the process. She followed it up with an impressive victory in the King George at Ascot this year -- beating Nathaniel by a nose to become the first filly and the first German-trained horse to win Europe's two most important all-age races. And her latest triumph came in her native Germany, winning the Longines Grosser Preis von Baden by half a length Sunday against some of the best three-year-old colts in the country. But just two years ago, few believed that the delicate filly would one day be a champion. As racing fairy tales go, Danedream's story has more than a few similarities with the story of Seabiscuit, the unlikely hero of American flat racing during the 1930s. Impeccable bloodline . Although she boasts impeccable bloodlines (her sire Lomitas is a former German Horse of the Year and one of the most prominent stallions in Germany; her mother, Danedrop, though unraced, carries the blood of great sire Danehill in her veins), Danedream was backward as a yearling and eventually consigned by her breeders, Gestut Brummerhof, as a two-year-old. Her appearance in the sales ring at Baden-Baden in the spring of 2010 failed to whet buyers' appetites and she was eventually sold for just 9,000 euros to a former furniture retailer named Heiko Volz. ""It was the best deal of my life and probably the best deal in the racing business,"" a delighted Volz told CNN. Sent to trainer Peter Schiergen's yard in Cologne for training, her two-year-old season was solid if not electrifying, belying few hints of her true ability. It was when, as a three-year-old, Schiergen stepped her up in trip to 2,300m that she first demonstrated her class, running third to the colts in the Italian Derby. But it was on her return to Germany that Danedream firmly buried her detractors once and for all, winning the Grosser Preis von Berlin by five lengths and the Grosser Preis von Baden by seven lengths. Arc triumph . If the secret was out in German racing circles, few outside of Germany knew about the little bay filly with the incredible lengthening stride. Which brings us back to that day in Paris in 2011. By now part-owned by Japanese owner-breeder Terry Yoshida, she was supplemented as a last-minute entry to the 2001 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. ""We had to pay 100,000 euros to get her in,"" said her trainer. ""The owners said they wanted to have a horse run in the Arc for once in their lives. They would have been happy with a good result or a place in the top four horses. Nobody thought she would win."" It was a view shared by the bookmakers as she was sent off as a 20/1 outsider. But while all eyes were on the giant Australian favorite So You Think, or perhaps on one of the Aga Khan's stash of smart fillies such as Sarafina, Danedream slowly but surely moved through the field, taking over the lead from St Nicholas Abbey in the final furlong and eventually winning easily by five lengths. Her winning time of 2:24:49 broke the course record held since 1997. ""She took off in the straight and destroyed the colts. It was amazing,"" says Schiergen. Training Danedream has a special significance for him: a former champion jockey, Schiergen rode her sire Lomitas to victory in the Grosser Preis von Baden in 1991. Amazing horse . ""The biggest feeling for me was Lomitas. He was my first Group 1 winner and he was an amazing horse. But as a trainer I have to say that Danedream is the best horse I've trained in my time."" While Schiergen has masterminded Danedream's career from the ground, her jockey, Andrasch Starke, is heavily involved in Danedream's preparations, riding the filly out most days. ""She's very easy, anybody could ride her,"" he says modestly. She is known for her economical approach to training: ""She just does what she has to. She doesn't give you the feeling that she's a Group 1 horse in the work but when the starting gates open she's a different horse."" Thanks to his association with Danedream, Starke's trophy cabinet contains such silverware as few German jockeys have ever dreamed of, including the Arc and the King George, which was presented to him by British monarch Queen Elizabeth II. ""I think one of these horses comes along maybe every fifty years,"" he acknowledges. ""She's a horse of a lifetime for me."" On the eve of her defense of her Grosser Preis von Baden title the ""Danedream effect"" was very much in evidence in Baden-Baden. Baden Baden besieged . Nestled in the foothills of the Black Forest, the sedate spa town has been besieged by the international racing set. Friday's yearling sales drew an unprecedented level of international interest, with trainers and bloodstock agents from countries including the UK, France, the USA and Hong Kong, all hoping to snap up the next Danedream. Indeed, Danedream has become something of an unofficial ambassador for German racing. So it is with interest that a nation expectantly awaits her next move. With the end of her career now closer than the beginning, Schiergen has mapped out her few remaining appearances with precision: after Baden, she will head to Longchamp where she will attempt to become the first filly since Corrida in 1937 to defend the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, followed by a tilt at the Japan Cup in November, where she will likely remain and be retired to stud. For Schiergen, who has been so closely associated with this dynasty, it is a bitter sweet ending. ""It's sad that she won't stay in Germany. She has done so much for German racing. Even if you don't know racing, you've heard of Danedream. But they have good stallions in Japan, such as Deep Impact. Maybe they'll send me a nice yearling to train. I hope so.""","Danedream rated one of the best fillies of all time .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes it's hard to know what to believe about Mario Balotelli. His two years in England with Manchester City were packed with reports of his eccentric behaviour, from setting his bathroom alight with fireworks (before being named a fire safety spokesman) to a training brawl with his club manager, giving money away to strangers ... the list was endless. And now Italian sports paper Gazzetta dello Sport has reported firstly, on Friday, that the soccer star has been named as one of Time's 100 most influential people of 2012 (though there is no evidence of that on the magazine's website) and then, on the way to a game on Sunday, he was caught smoking in the toilet of a train, which will cost him a fine. What is certain is that Balotelli, who appeared on the cover of Time Europe last November, will miss a crucial game next weekend that will have a major impact on his club AC Milan's hopes of automatically qualifying for next season's Champions League. The 22-year-old was booked in third-placed Milan's 2-2 draw with fellow European hopefuls Fiorentina, for trying to delay an opposition free-kick with 20 minutes to play. The fourth-placed home side -- at that point 2-1 down and playing with 10 men since before halftime after Nenad Tomovic was sent off for elbowing Balotelli's strike partner Stephan El Shaarawy -- fought back to equalize through a late penalty by David Pizarro. It was Fiorentina's second spot-kick, with Adam Ljajic having reduced the deficit on 66 after goals from midfielders Riccardo Montolivo and Mathiu Flamini had put Milan in charge. The result left Milan 13 points behind leaders Juventus and four adrift of next weekend's opponent Napoli -- who beat lowly Genoa 2-0 later Sunday despite a second-half penalty miss by Edinson Cavani. The top two teams will automatically qualify for the group stage of Europe's top club competition, in which Milan lost in the last 16 to Barcelona this season, while the third must play in the final qualifying round. ""Considering the score after the first half, it's a big slip-up for us,"" Milan assistant coach Mauro Tassotti said on the club's website. ""A win would have cut Fiorentina out of the Champions League race as they would have been nine points off. Balotelli will be suspended now against Napoli and Giampaolo Pazzini will play. He now has another full week to improve his condition."" Pazzini has been struggling with injury since the March 8 win over Genoa, but came off the bench late in the game against Fiorentina. Fiorentina could lose fourth place if Lazio win Monday's Rome derby -- a result which would further dent Inter Milan's European hopes. Sixth-placed Inter suffered a shock 4-3 defeat at home to Atalanta, whose veteran Argentine striker German Denis scored a second-half hat-trick to outshine Ricardo Alvarez's double. In Spain, Atletico Madrid's poor second half to the season continued with a 0-0 draw at Getafe in which the third-placed team had Mario Suarez and Diego Godin sent off. It left Atletico three points behind city rivals Real, and 17 behind leaders Barcelona. Valencia moved up to fifth with a 2-1 victory at home to 10-man Valladolid to be two points behind Sociedad, holders of the last Champions League spot. Jonas headed an injury-time winner after Oscar Gonzalez leveled, with Henrique Sereno having been sent off in the 56th minute for fouling Valencia striker Roberto Soldado -- whose resulting penalty was saved..","Mario Balotelli will miss AC Milan's crucial match against Italian rivals Napoli .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""She was lovely, her name was Sylvia, and that's how the dream started."" At the age of ten, Frankie Dettori rides his first public race on the back of Sylvia: ""She was lovely."" Sylvia was the beloved, blonde-maned pony who carried a young Frankie Dettori past the post in his first public race. Her picture is now carefully filed away in the vast library of Dettori family photos. The date's embossed on the leather album cover: June 17, 1981. He was ten. They came last. Frankie Dettori has come a long way since following the pack as a schoolboy in a bright yellow and blue helmet and a red striped shirt at home in Sardinia. He has won every major racing title. His new home in Newmarket -- near the famous British racetrack -- is crammed with trophies from almost three thousand wins. Now in the twilight of his career, Dettori could be forgiven for bathing in the shimmering light of the hundreds of shiny silver trophies lined up in a row of glass-fronted cabinets. But this jockey has his eyes firmly forward. ""When I look at this it's the past, and I'm looking at the future,"" he says, ""This is what I've managed to accumulate in my life and it might mean something to me when I retire but right now I'm just looking to put some more things in."" At the starting gates . Frankie Dettori was just 14 when his father, a successful jockey himself, sent his only son to Britain to learn the art of racing. He became an apprentice to Ray Cochrane, a stable jockey to Luca Cumani, one of Britain's leading trainers. ""He arrived, a scruffy kid who couldn't speak a great deal of English, with a big pair of wellies and we've been friends ever since,"" Cochrane remembers. Frankie Dettori learnt quickly and eventually took Cochrane's job, ""he didn't take it, I vacated that position so he could have it,"" corrects Cochrane. His former boss is now Dettori's agent. ""It's a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. We get enquiries from all over the world,"" he says. ""He doesn't want to be riding every day because there's so much old tosh running every day -- he doesn't need to be involved in that."" At the races . Dettori's first big win came in 1989 on the back of ""Mark of Distinction,"" but it wasn't until 1996 that his name leapt from the racing pages to headlines around the world. On one day in September, he won seven races from seven starts against odds of 25,095 to one. ""It's something that I'm proud of because I'm the first man to do it,"" Dettori says. read more about Frankie's magnificent seven . Until June 2, 2007, only one major title had eluded the irrepressible jockey. ""It took me 15 years to win the Derby."" Dettori says, of the race that's considered one of the highlights of the British racing calendar. ""I was so nervous and excited and I would like to go back and win it again to enjoy it more,"" he adds. Nick Smith of Ascot talks about the day Frankie won the Derby » . A crashing halt . Almost to the day, seven years earlier, Frankie Dettori came close to losing it all. He and Ray Cochrane were the only passengers in a light plane when it crashed shortly after takeoff near the Newmarket racecourse on June 1, 2000. The pilot, Patrick Mackey, died. ""The only thing I remember is opening my eyes and staring at the engines on fire. Was this the other side? I couldn't figure it out,"" Dettori recalls. Ray Cochrane pulled him from the plane seconds before it exploded. ""It was all crashed in on top of Frankie and he was all covered in blood,"" Cochrane remembers. ""I just pushed the back door open and got him out of that there... It was a horrendous day. It would have been nice if everyone had got out but unfortunately they didn't."" Dettori underwent surgery for a broken ankle and returned to the track just ten weeks later. Rather than make him more reticent in the saddle, the accident made him more determined to win. ""I enjoy life to the full, every moment, occasion,"" Dettori says. ""Friends, family, jobs, I try to live it like it's my last time."" Off the track . Away from the racecourse, Frankie Dettori likes to spend as much time as he can with his wife Catherine and children Leo, Ella, Mia, Tallulah and Rocco. ""When I sometimes take the kids to school, or when I take them anywhere, and I realize I've got five children, I really say to myself 'what have I done?'"" ""You have good days and bad days in life and when you come home to five lovely children and they've all got a story to tell you, I think 'this is what life is all about.'"" Frankie's other love is food. It's an obsession borne of his Italian heritage and the constant pressure to meet the strict weight targets demanded by his profession. Catherine is accustomed to living with her husband's mood swings when he's surviving on one meal a day and exercising in plastic suits to lose the pounds. It's a process they call ""wasting."" ""It's on his mind every day all day. He weighs himself in the middle of the night and I hear the scales tick,"" she says. Catherine Dettori tells Revealed about life with the jockey . Frankie's manager Ray Cochrane knows how hard the experience can be.""You can imagine being on a diet for eleven months of the year. After you've lost the first stone and a half, then you've got to drop another ten pounds. Maybe lose about four or five pounds daily."" It's especially hard for a man who admits he has a sweet tooth -- ""I might nick the children's chocolate or a cup of tea"" -- and often succumbs to temptation. ""I am victim of a slice of pizza from time to time. I really like it."" Dettori likes it so much that he teamed up with Michelin-starred chef and restaurateur Marco Pierre White to open a chain of family-friendly Italian restaurants. ""Frankie's"" first opened its doors in Knightsbridge, London in September, 2004. Now there are six worldwide, in London, Shanghai and Dubai. ""What's important about Frankie is that firstly he loves food, and second he loves that world, that environment,"" says Marco Pierre White. ""As a young boy, Frankie gave himself two choices: jockey or chef. He chose to be a jockey because he felt he was too small to be a chef, but it's a natural environment to be involved in."" For now, Frankie Dettori's ambitions still lie on the racecourse. ""First and foremost I'm a jockey and that's what I do best,"" he says. ""When I perhaps stop my racing career then I can pursue this business a little bit further but at this stage I need to concentrate on my racing because that's what I'm good at."" Few could argue with that. E-mail to a friend .","Superstar jockey Frankie Dettori rode first public race on ""Sylvia"", aged 10 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A sharp disagreement over the future treatment of undocumented workers on America's farms is holding up progress on the comprehensive immigration reform bill being considered by the Senate's so-called ""Gang of Eight."" The two key sticking points are wages and the number of visas to be granted to undocumented farm workers, two sources close to the talks confirmed Friday. ""It's the one major unresolved issue,"" one of the sources told CNN. The sources were unable to provide specifics in terms of the number of visas or wage levels under consideration. But, generally speaking, agricultural businesses have an interest in more visas and lower wages. Labor leaders, in contrast, typically support fewer visas and higher wages. Aside from the agricultural dispute, both sources stressed that the sheer complexity of the major reform bill could slow the timetable for its public unveiling. Senators are hoping to release the bill next week, but a significant amount of time is required for staffers from multiple offices to work their way through the lengthy proposal. The Democratic-controlled Senate and the GOP-controlled House each are working on immigration reform plans. Both chambers are expected to advance their respective blueprints some point soon after Congress returns next week from its spring break. The agricultural dispute is just one component of a plan that would provide the first major overhaul of America's immigration laws since 1986. Among other things, the Senate bill aims to provide a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented residents. It would also create a new system for assessing the state of border security. Members of the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" are Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona; Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona; Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois; Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York. A separate group of four senators -- Rubio, Bennet, Utah Republican Orrin Hatch and California Democrat Dianne Feinstein -- is trying to resolve the agricultural dispute.","Dispute over agricultural workers is slowing progress on immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- For several months now, Filipinos have been treated to the spectacle of yet another impeachment trial aired on national television. Renato Corona, chief justice of the Supreme Court is in the dock, accused of illegally amassing cash and real estate as well as of ""partiality and subservience"" to the previous president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. In a country where politics has always been about scandal and spectacle, it's showtime once again. In the past weeks, prosecutors at the trial have submitted evidence of posh apartments allegedly purchased by the chief justice as well as substantial amounts in his bank accounts. These, they said, weren't listed on his financial disclosures and their total value far exceed his legitimate earnings. If this sounds like an old script, it's because it is. In 2001, then president Joseph Estrada was impeached -- and later overthrown in a popular uprising -- for much the same reasons. And it all happened on national television. Cheered on by Manila's rambunctious media and chattering classes, coalitions of both reform-minded and opportunistic politicians have since then attempted to restage the triumph by launching impeachment suits against a succession of high officials. These high-profile political dramas capture the public's attention and raise awareness about malfeasance in high places. But are they the best way to fight corruption? Is the ""sturm und drang"" of political trials the most effective way of cleansing government? The current president, Benigno Aquino III, seems to think so. As a legislator, he had backed Estrada's impeachment and also the failed impeachment of Arroyo, whose family was hounded by accusations of corruption. As president, he vowed to bring Arroyo to trial. He has also supported the impeachment of the anti-corruption ombudsman. Now it's the chief justice's turn. Aquino came to office on an anti-corruption platform. His election slogan was ""daang matuwid"" -- the straight path -- and his allies believe that powerful officials who obstruct that path must be forced out. In particular, they see the ombudsman and the chief justice, both Arroyo loyalists, as obstacles to the prosecution not only of the former president but of others they want to hold to account. But this strategy is not without political costs. If the chief justice is not impeached, then Aquino will have a sworn enemy in the country's highest court. The Philippine Supreme Court is a powerful institution: it can block the implementation of laws and also obstruct legal action against corrupt officials. The long, drawn-out trial has already taken its toll. Legislation has been stalled as Congress focuses on the impeachment. And the bizarre, and sometimes comic, twists and turns of the chief justice's trial has sucked up the public attention and shifted it away from the systemic reforms that are urgently needed. Meanwhile, largely away from the public gaze, some of Aquino's Cabinet have been cleaning up. The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism recently reported that the secretary of public works had overhauled the bidding procedures for road projects and had cut down the costs of some projects by over 30%. In 2009, the World Bank complained about ""systemic corruption and bid rigging"" in Philippine public works projects. Now it seems that under-the-radar reforms are gaining ground; there are signs that the collusive system that begot the legendary corruption in the country's road projects is being dismantled. Tax revenues are also at a record high, thanks to two reform-minded officials who head the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs, which have traditionally been impregnable fortresses of graft. Tax collection has risen nearly 30%, even without new taxes, the largest ever increase in 20 years. These developments provide reason for hope. They have also largely taken place outside the cockfighting arena of congressional or judicial politics. Political trials can be cathartic. They bring wrongdoers to justice. They also provide opportunities for civic education. But they have proven to be a riskier and less effective path for anti-corruption reform. After all, the ouster of the womanizing and boozing Estrada -- who built palatial mansions for his mistresses and received briefcases stashed with cash from illegal gambling operators -- paved the way for the rise to the presidency of Arroyo, who now stands charged with rigging her election and squandering public funds so she can stay in office. By casting the spotlight on the wrongdoing committed by individuals and focusing on the moral failures of one man or one woman, political trials blind citizens to the terrible truth: corruption is a cancer. Taking out a nasty tumor will not necessarily bring about a cure. Will the Supreme Court, for example, be transformed into an institution that is above reproach once it is purged of its unsympathetic and fallible chief justice? Nearly 10 years ago, I wrote about how the weakness of check-and-balance mechanisms within the high tribunal and the porousness of the structures and procedures that govern the court allowed illicit approaches to justices. I found a network of brokers composed of well-connected individuals who act as intermediaries to some justices and offer to fix cases for a price. I don't know that such porousness has since been plugged or that there will be a radical change if the current chief goes. But there will certainly be a court that's friendlier to the president. Like cancer, corruption thrives on a system's vulnerabilities. For too long, Filipinos have been complicit in corruption because that was the only way to get contracts and other benefits from government. Politicians were allowed to dip their snouts in the public trough as long as they granted favors to their constituents. Aquino was elected to office on the hope that he can change all that. His government is taking two paths to reform. The first is public trials. The second is the less trodden, less showy and less glamorous path of changing systems and procedures and depoliticizing the reform process. In the end, this path will be the more enduring. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sheila S. Coronel .","The Philippines is currently gripped by public trial of chief justice of Supreme Court .
Country has long been used to scandal and spectacle in political sphere .
President Benigno Acquino was elected on an anti-corruption platform .
Changing political and legal system and procedures could be most effective way to reform ."
"(CNN) -- Five-time champion Serena Williams survived an early injury scare to cruise into the second round of the Australian Open on Tuesday. The American third seed rolled her ankle when 4-0 up in the opening set of her match with Romania's Edina Gallovits-Hall, but retained her composure to seal an emphatic 6-0 6-0 ""double bagel"" triumph. ""I haven't had enough time to assess it yet,"" the 15-time grand slam champion told reporters after arriving at her press conference on crutches. ""I saw the doctor again -- we're just going to see how it is in a few hours from now. ""But I'll be out there on Thursday -- I mean, unless something fatal happens to me -- there's no way I'm not going to be out there competing. I'm alive. My heart's beating. I'll be fine."" Williams' second-round opponent will be Garbine Muguruza, who survived a marathon third set against Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova to seal a 4-6 6-1 14-12 win. The 31-year-old also injured her ankle last year, at the Brisbane warmup tournament, and then lost in the fourth round in Melbourne. ""It reminded me a lot of Brisbane. I thought, 'Oh, not again.' But, you know, I've had such a good year that I don't think it's anything negative,"" she said. ""I've been injured before. I've played this tournament with so many injuries and was able to come out on top. ""So for me, it's just another page, and a great story to tell the grandkids one day."" Top seed Victoria Azarenka also advanced at the expense of a Romanian, recovering from 0-3 down in the second set to beat the unseeded Monica Niculescu 6-1 6-4. ""Her game is definitely unusual, but I've known her since we played Under 14s, and she actually played a lot more spin back then -- it was all slice from both sides before,"" said the defending champion, who will next play Greece's Eleni Daniilidou. ""Monica's unusual and tries to make you feel a little bit miserable on the court, like you don't know what to do, because every ball comes from different angles. So it's important to just keep your focus and execute your shots."" Two grand slam champions went head-to-head in the Margaret Court Arena, with 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova edging past Italy's Francesca Schiavone -- who clinched the 2010 French Open title. Czech eighth seed Kvitova battled to a 6-4 2-6 6-2 win to set up a tie with British Olympic mixed doubles silver medalist Laura Robson. Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm made history by beating Russian 12th seed Nadia Petrova 6-2 6-0, becoming the oldest player to win a match at the Australian Open. The 100th-ranked 42-year-old broke a record previously held by Britain's Virginia Wade. ""Playing at this age is really nothing,"" explained Date-Krumm. ""I eat a lot, I sleep a lot -- last night I was in the bed before 10 p.m. I finished dinner at 7:30 already, then sleep before 10 like the kids! ""Because after practice or after matches I'm always tired, so I just need to recover more. It's a simple life. Nothing special. ""Of course I'm very happy to win today, but I don't play for records. Even if I lose, I still enjoy it."" Italian seventh seed Sara Errani also fell at the first hurdle. The 2011 French Open finalist lost 6-4 6-4 to Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro. In the men's draw, four-time champion Roger Federer cruised through his opener against France's world No. 46 Benoit Paire, winning 6-2 6-4 6-1 in just 83 minutes. The second seed paid tribute to ATP Tour chief Brad Drewett following Tuesday's news that he will stand down as head of men's tennis after being diagnosed with the motor-neurone disease. ""I saw him yesterday and he told me the news. I've known Brad ever since I came on tour ... I call him a friend,"" said Federer, who is looking for an Open era-record fifth win in Melbourne. The Australian, a former tennis pro, has played a key part in expanding the men's game into Asia, taking the season-ending championships to Shanghai before it switched to London in 2009. ""He was so influential. He goes so far back and has touched so many people throughout his career as a player and then also as an executive and then CEO,"" Federer said. ""It's been very hard to see him not doing so well, so we wish him the best. I worked with him very closely, especially the last few years now, and he deserved to be CEO and chairman."" Federer will play fellow 31-year-old Nikolay Davydenko in round two after Russia's world No. 40 defeated Israel's Dudi Sela. U.S. Open champion Andy Murray began his bid for a third final appearance in four years at the Melbourne grand slam with a comfortable 6-3 6-1 6-3 win against Dutchman Robin Haase. Haase saved two match points, but world No. 3 Murray -- beaten by Federer in the 2010 final and Novak Djokovic last year -- shrugged off any suggestion nerves were negatively impacting his game. ""If you aren't nervous, it shows that you're really not that bothered,"" said the 25-year-old Murray after setting up a meeting with Portugal's Joao Sousa. ""When the nerves are there, sometimes it can be for 10, 15 minutes before you go on the court or the beginning of the match or the evening beforehand. They can affect you at different times. ""But it shows that you care, and that's the positive you take out of it. Often when you are nervous, you can play your best tennis."" Fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga advanced at the expense of fellow Frenchman Michael Llodra, sealing a 6-4 7-5 6-2 success. Next up for the 2008 runner-up is Japan's Go Soeda. Canada's 13th seed and rising star Milos Raonic eventually hammered down 104th-ranked Czech Jan Hajek, smashing 30 aces to card a 3-6 6-1 6-2 7-6 (7-0) win in two hours and 35 minutes. He will next face fellow big server Lukas Rosol, famous for defeating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon 2012.","Serena Williams survives injury scare to reach Australian Open second round .

"(CNN) -- Forgot to charge your cell phone last night? Imagine that you could power it by walking. Weirder still, you might be able to just spray a new battery on. Z.L. Wang shows an enlarged image of zinc oxide nanowires, less than the width of a hair in reality. These concepts are being developed by two leading nanotechnology researchers who are developing cleaner, more efficient ways of delivering electrical power. In working toward making these ideas realities, they are making use of structures that are 100 nanometers or smaller, where one nanometer is a billionth of a meter. ""[The nanoscale] can make the components small, sensitive and high-performance,"" said Zhong Lin ""Z.L."" Wang, distinguished professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Engineering. ""The toughness and the flexibility increase by orders of magnitude."" Barely lifting a finger . Wang and colleagues are working on harnessing the energy of the body's natural movements to power small devices. Even the simple act of moving your fingers while typing creates energy that could power a small device, and these researchers are showing that nanotechnology can enable this transformation. Here's the hard science: To take advantage of animal movement for energy, Wang's team makes use of the piezoelectric effect, which refers to the ability of certain materials to generate an electric potential when a stress is applied to them. For instance, if you compress a crystal, it temporarily changes shape, causing the ions inside the crystal to polarize and produce a voltage drop.  Learn about other applications of nanotechnology » . That potential can drive a transient flow of external electrons to function as an energy output. Zinc oxide nanowires, which are environmentally friendly, have this property. Wang and colleagues are using these materials in making solar cells, which would have less potentially harmful impact on the environment than the traditionally-used silicon. They also use them make nanogenerators that can potentially harvest the energy from any mechanical movement. The group had success in animal models -- for instance, in harvesting energy from a hamster running on a wheel that wears a nanodevice on its back. They have also implanted a nanogenerator on the heart of a mouse, and are able to capture energy from just the heart beat -- albeit only some picowatts (one million millionth of a watt). The eventual goal is to create a way for people to self-power a blood pressure or glucose monitor -- for instance, by implanting a small device in the arm. Read about nanotechnology and cancer research . ""Within three years, the power generated should be enough to power these kinds of devices,"" Wang said. Wang also demonstrated how one of these tiny devices on a wire attached to a person's finger can harvest energy from stretching and bending the finger. 'Next-next generation' batteries . Scientists want to develop energy sources based on inexpensive, abundant, eco-friendly materials that generate higher power. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researchers are doing that by engineering viruses that build materials for batteries. ""We're letting biology help us work on solving those problems, solving what the next-next generation batteries are going to be,"" said Angela Belcher, professor of materials science and engineering at MIT and winner of a 2004 MacArthur Foundation genius grant. Here's how it works: Belcher and colleagues synthesize a virus called M13 bacteriophage, which is wire-shaped and only about 9 nanometers thin. This virus is common -- ""you have bacteriophage all over you,"" Belcher said -- and is harmless to humans. A traditional battery has a negatively charged ""anode"" and a positively charged ""cathode,"" and charged particles called ions flow between them. As they demonstrated in a paper in the journal Science in April, a cathode can be made when engineered viruses coat themselves with iron phosphate, then bind to carbon nanotubes, which are cylindrical carbon molecules. The result is an extremely conductive network of these nanotubes. Ten grams of their cathode materials can power one portable media player for about 40 hours, which is equivalent to three normal portable media batteries in the same device, Belcher said. In 2006, the team showed that the anode could also be built by viruses -- this time, coating themselves with cobalt oxide and gold. The viruses essentially become small wires. Given that the battery grows itself, there's basically no manufacturing waste. No toxic materials are involved either, Belcher said. During the assembly process, the viruses are not alive, Belcher said. ""They're just a protein scaffold to be able to grab ions out of solution or build materials exactly the way we need them to grow,"" she said. Once the battery is made, the virus can no longer make copies of itself, she said. While the current prototypes are powerful, they won't come to market because researchers want to make them out of even better materials. In five or 10 years, though, they could be available for specialty applications, Belcher said. She and colleagues are also working on spray-on batteries -- just spray on the components, including the viruses, like spray paint -- and batteries that attach like rubber stamps. The stampable batteries could be used for cards on which information is stored, such as IDs and credit cards, she said. The business of nanotech . Some of the nanotech energy devices sold today include nano-enhanced lithium ion batteries that perform better and are safer than their predecessors, he said. Several companies also are working on flexible solar cells -- meaning one day ""you could even have something like an awning or a backpack made out of a material that produces solar electricity,"" said Michael Holman, research director at Lux Research, an independent research and advisory firm providing advice about emerging technologies. But ""there's still a big disconnect between the hype and the reality,"" of nanotechnology in the energy sector, he said. Only 0.6 percent of nanotech revenues in 2007 came from energy and environment applications, according to a report from Lux, and they predict only 1.8 percent in 2015. Holman cautioned that many of the technologies that have come to the market, such as the lithium ion batteries, are incremental advances rather than breakthroughs. Still, the studies that Wang and Belcher are doing are important, he said. It may be decades before human motion could translate into more than a small fraction of general energy use, but in the nearer term it could hold promise in small sensor applications such as environmental monitoring, Holman said. Belcher's work on batteries is ""exactly the kind of research we need to keep doing"" as scientists progress toward goals such as powering electric cars, for example, he said.","Device could allow people to self-power a blood pressure or glucose monitor .
Materials for an efficient battery, waste-free battery were made by viruses .
Spray-on and stampable batteries are being tested at MIT .
Energy and environment applications are a tiny portion of nano revenues now ."
"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Chile's Communist Party said it wants authorities to exhume poet Pablo Neruda's body as part of an investigation into his 1973 death. ""There is no other way to resolve this terrible doubt,"" lawyer Eduardo Contreras told Chile's Radio Bio-Bio in an interview quoted in a statement on the party's website. The Nobel Prize-winning poet's death certificate says he died of prostate cancer, but Neruda's former chauffeur alleges that he was killed by an injection in the clinic where he was undergoing treatment, the Communist Party said. Neruda died on September 23, 1973, just 12 days after a right-wing military coup that overthrew the South American country's government. Chilean Judge Mario Carroza ordered an investigation into Neruda's death in June, noting that police, witness and medical records would be examined, Chile's judicial authority said. The judge has not said whether Neruda's body will be exhumed. A biography of the poet on the website of the Neruda Foundation, which Neruda's widow founded to promote and preserve his legacy, notes the coup as a significant date in his life. ""The majority of Neruda's friends were made prisoners or had to hide or seek political asylum in other countries,"" it says. But the foundation's leader told Radio Bio-Bio this week that the organization opposed the exhumation because they did not believe there was a ""third party"" involved in Neruda's death. ""We are against an exhumation of his cadaver because it would seem to us a true act of desecration,"" Juan Agustin Figueroa said. Neruda, a member of Chile's Communist Party, was also a lawmaker in the South American country and served as its ambassador to France. But internationally, he is most well known for his poetry. Neruda received the Nobel Prize in Literature 1971 ""for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent's destiny and dreams."" As part of a massive investigation of 726 reported human rights violations during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's rule, authorities exhumed former Chilean President Salvador Allende earlier this year. Official accounts ruled the leftist leader's death a suicide, saying that he shot himself -- with a gun that was reportedly a gift from Fidel Castro -- as Pinochet's troops closed in on the presidential palace. In July, Chile's Legal Medical Service confirmed that suicide was the cause of Allende's death.

"(CNN) -- When the news came, Darrell Griffin hurled the phone. Darrell Griffin captured a moment with his son three years before Skip's death in March 2007. Then he got in his car and navigated the madness of Los Angeles highways, thankful only for the time it gave him to think about what he would say to his family. Later, consumed with the grief of losing a son, Griffin drew the drapes in his bedroom and made his world mimic the darkness in his heart. After he buried Darrell ""Skip"" Griffin Jr. and after the sympathy calls faded, the elder Griffin, like every American who has ever lost a beloved soldier, struggled to resume life's normal rhythms. But this is where Griffin's journey veered from others and took a twist so unique that it made the U.S. Army bend its rock-hard rules. The 55-year-old accounting consultant, who opposed Vietnam and had never served in combat, traveled to the epicenter of the Iraq war. There, he would trace his son's last days. The result, ""Last Journey: A Father and Son in Wartime,"" is a common story about a father-son relationship, told in an uncommon way.  Listen to Darrell Griffin read excerpts from his son's journal » . The education of a warrior . Griffin's eldest son joined the Army for all the reasons listed on recruitment posters. He wanted to serve his nation and straighten himself out in the process. He became a soldier's soldier: never disobeyed an order and went beyond the call of duty. He served two tours in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star with Valor for dragging a fellow soldier to safety through a hail of enemy gunfire. The father who had avoided the draft during Vietnam by joining the National Guard understood that the Army was his son's way of helping others. He had been a rebellious child and often spent long hours in detention, where he read voraciously: Nietzsche, Descartes, Herodotus, Plato. In Iraq, he would rely on intellectual writings to ponder lofty concepts like what constitutes a just war. Both Griffin men had misgivings about Iraq and whether it was the right place to battle radical Islam. Skip began a conversation with his father. What would it feel like to kill? ""The whole thing about philosophy is that it leads to more questions,"" Griffin recalled. So it was OK for his son, the tough staff sergeant who had the words ""Malleus Dei"" (""God's hammer"") stenciled on his equipment, to question the war. At his father's urging, Skip began to record his experience. He started a blog. He snapped a photo of the first man he shot: 12:33 p.m. April 21, 2006, according to the time stamp on his camera. The man wore a blue sweater and a white jacket that turned crimson. Skip spoke to his father, often in e-mails, about that kill, about every subsequent one and about all the ugliness he witnessed in a faraway land. December 9, 2006: ""This is no way for a human being to live; living with violence and intrigue on every street corner, where you can't even trust your own neighbors for fear that they might be someone on the opposing side. Once again I had to push this heartbreaking thought deep into my heart because I was a Squad Leader leading nine heavily armed young men and trying to bring them home alive."" Several weeks later, Skip's unit was in the thick of battle in the Shiite heartlands of Najaf and Karbala. He wrote home about ""apocalyptic"" battles in which he saw ""hundreds of blown apart bodies."" January 30, 2007: ""Dad, I have seen what hell must be like when we assaulted this compound. ... There were fathers bringing up their dead babies to me and shoving them into my arms for help."" When Skip came home on leave, father and son talked over a bottle of Merlot. Griffin noticed what so many other parents do about their war-weary children. Skip was as loving as ever, but the killing had changed him. ""He seemed to have a need to constantly play certain scenes over again in our conversations,"" Griffin would later write. ""As we dissected these scenes into smaller and smaller pieces, his feelings of guilt began to percolate to the surface. Still, he always ended every talk with: 'Dad, I love you.' "" Skip wanted to pen a book of his musings on war. But his work was left unfinished when he was felled by a sniper's bullet March 21, 2007. Embedding with his son's unit . After the funeral, Griffin knew that he had to finish the book as a final gift to his son. He also knew that it would have to be radically different than the philosophical essays Skip had envisioned. It would have to focus on Skip's death. From the military, Griffin had received skimpy incident reports and the results of an autopsy. The only way he could fully tell his son's story would be to travel to Iraq and spend time with Skip's unit. ""I had to do it,"" Griffin said. ""My life was incomplete. My son's life was incomplete."" Griffin wrote to everyone he could think of to enlist help, including Gen. David Petraeus, then the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Petraeus told Griffin that he was asking for the near-impossible, especially since military operations in Iraq were in high gear. Amazingly, a few weeks later, Griffin found himself on a C-130 transport plane from Kuwait to Baghdad. He would join Skip's unit in the 2-3 Stryker Brigade, at a base near the Baghdad airport. ""I was very impressed by Mr. Griffin's determination and commitment to finish what his son had begun and to spend time with his son's former unit to do it,"" Petraeus told CNN. ""In my view, his situation was truly unique, and thus it was one in which we decided to make an exception to normal practice."" Griffin landed in Baghdad with a fear that transcended roadside bombs and mortar rounds. How would his son's unit treat him? What would he say? What would he ask? He took care to refer to his son as ""Griff."" That's how his Army buddies knew him. He slept on a cot in a metal containerized housing unit just as his son had. He heard the gravel crunch under his boots as he walked through the base, following his son's footsteps. Despite the awkwardness, the soldiers opened up. Griffin could tell they were hurting, too. ""It was bound up in them,"" Griffin said. ""They wanted to talk about it and get it out."" Sometimes, they shut the video camera off and just cried together. Griffin's commitment to the book helped shield him from the painful details he was about to learn, the story of his son's last day. Skip was standing in the hatch of a Stryker armored vehicle, just 15 minutes outside the gates of the base. The familiar rat-a-tat of small arms fire filled the air. Confusion reigned. Sgt. Christopher Pacheco noticed that Skip's legs were limp. The soldiers pulled his body back into the vehicle and desperately wrapped his head with gauze to stop the blood. Skip's breathing was labored, erratic. He was transported to a combat hospital but died before he could be airlifted to Balad Air Base, where a specialist in head trauma waited. ""Last Journey: A Father and Son in Wartime"" has received warm reviews. In the seventh year of the war, myriad books on Iraq have sprouted on store shelves. But this has been lauded for its unique voice. These days, Griffin attends events celebrating his work and regularly visits Skip's grave at Los Angeles National Cemetery, where a headstone reads: . ""Darrell Ray Griffin Jr . S Sgt . U.S. Army. Iraqi Freedom . Mar 13 1971 - Mar 21 2007 . BSM w V PH KIA . Beloved husband son and brother"" The elder Griffin is glad he fulfilled his promise and was able to tell his son's story beyond the facts spelled out on a cold grave. He looks to the heavens and knows his son is smiling down at him, saying ""Dad, we did it.""","Soldier's book was left unfinished when he was killed in Iraq .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Military divers have found the body of a U.S. paratrooper who went missing last week in a river in western Afghanistan. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the soldier was found close to where he disappeared November 4. Officials are continuing their search for a second paratrooper lost at the same time. Both men -- from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division -- disappeared in the Morghab River near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan. The men were on a routine resupply mission, the NATO group said. Family members identified the recovered body as that of Benjamin Sherman, 21, of Plymouth, Massachusetts. They said he jumped into the river when he saw a fellow soldier struggling in the water. ""I know that day he jumped into the river to try to save his comrade was because he didn't just see another soldier in the water; he saw his brother,"" said Sherman's sister, Meredith, in a statement to CNN affiliate WCVB in Boston, Massachusetts. ""He didn't jump in because he was trained to but because that's what his heart told him to do."" Sherman's mother, Denise, said the family called him ""the unstoppable one."" ""I raised him with the understanding that when you choose to do something, you do it to the best of your ability,"" she said in a statement to WCVB. ""He was powerful, ingenuous and determined.""

"(CNN) -- It was over seven months ago, but Antonio Plaza Orozco clearly remembers when he was struck by the butt of the AK-47 and feeling the heat of the gunman's breath as he hissed: ""I will cut your neck, I will throw you overboard."" Orozco was the senior crewman aboard the Mattheos 1 when it was boarded by nearly a dozen pirates off the west coast of Africa. When the leader of the pirates asked for the highest ranking crewman, Orozco stepped forward only to be kicked and beaten. Orozco, who had been a seafarer for 22 of his 52 years of life, believed he was about to die. For eleven days the multi-national crew of 25, including 14 Filipinos, were held hostage, but thankfully their lives were spared. During those difficult days Orozco thought back to a simple eight-hour training course he took at the Philippine Transmarine Carriers. The course was a simple one involving simulations and classroom sessions that focused on dangers at sea, including surviving a hostage situation. That course is mandatory for all seafarers by the Philippine government. A third of all international seafarers are Filipino, which also makes them the largest group of hostages at sea. ""I remember, make friends with (the pirates),"" says Orozco. ""Don't make war. Be friends with them. ""Everyday I say, 'My brother, my brother, please don't kill us. Please, I have family also. My son is in school.' One of the pirates, I think he's a Christian, so we make a bible study."" Those odd moments of a Catholic hostage studying the bible with his pirate captor, is what Orozco believes led to his and his crew's survival. On September 24th, eleven days after their ordeal began, the pirates took as much cargo and money as they could carry and took off. Orozco credits the anti-piracy course for his survival, but the Philippine Seafarer's Union, the country's second largest union of seafarers, says the course is simply not enough. ""Anti-piracy training is not totally the solution,"" said union head Melchor Villanueva. The union believes what's really needed is a naval escort or private armed security on-board. The union readily admits the Philippine's navy is too poorly financed to even consider a naval escort for every citizen at sea, but wants the vessels' country of origin to provide the protection. The union knows that it's an empty call to action, asking other governments to protect foreign workers aboard ships in international waters. What the union won't do is urge its members to stop working at sea, even in the regions where pirates readily take seafarers hostage. The reason is that life at sea pays far better than a job on Philippine soil: 40% of Filipinos live on less than two dollars a day, while the starting salary for seafarers like Orozco is $1,500 a month. Thirty-year-old Reydomingo Nuval was on the same ship as Orozco, and says he will go back to sea because he needs to support his family. ""Going abroad as a Filipino, it's better. The salary there, we cannot find here. So by going abroad, you can easily build up your dreams, have a house, own a car, support your family and send your kids to a good school."" ""If I get hurt, it's a part of life,"" he adds.","One third of all seafarers on international vessels are from the Philippines .
Perils of being taken hostage or killed by pirates a very real threat .
Those who have survived hostage situation say they will return to the sea .
Pay for sailors is far higher than for many in the Philippines ."
"SARASOTA, Florida (CNN)  -- On a recent afternoon, Pamela Rinchich quietly recalled how her cancer doctor abruptly canceled an appointment. Rinchich owed $268 from a previous visit: She didn't have the money and the doctor refused to see her until she paid. Pamela Rinchich, with husband Jim, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after being laid off. ""I offered to do whatever I could, even work in the office to cover it,"" said Rinchich, with tears in her eyes. Just a few months earlier, life was going great for Rinchich. She was planning a wedding with her fiancé, Jim, and she had a good job as a supervisor at the Honeywell plant in Sarasota, Florida. In February 2008, she said, management called all the employees into the break room. ""We were told that our plant was closing,"" she said. The jobs were moving to Mexico. One hundred twenty-five people were laid off. Rinchich, who had worked at the plant for more than 20 years, picked up her last paycheck just days before her wedding in March. She was upset but optimistic. She had a plan. She had been taking classes to be a dental assistant. She didn't think she was going to have a problem finding a job. ""The economy wasn't as bad then."" Then, in late May, Rinchich found a lump in her breast. A mammogram confirmed the bad news: She had Stage 2 breast cancer. In early June, she underwent a full mastectomy and began chemotherapy. At first, Rinchich still was covered under Honeywell's health insurance plan. But by September, she had to pay for her own health insurance. Rinchich is far from alone. She is one of the millions of people President Obama said he wants to help with his ambitious plan to reform health care. Meet another family caught in the squeeze . On Thursday, Obama unveiled details of the federal budget for the next 10 years. Among other things, the budget calls for the creation of a $634 billion health care reserve fund. Among the fund's goals are universal health care coverage and reducing growth in insurance premiums.  Watch more on how Pamela Rinchich is coping » . The president's budget was unveiled just as the number of Americans who have lost their jobs -- and their employer-paid health insurance -- is growing. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, payroll employment has declined by 3.6 million since the start of the recession in December 2007. In the last three months alone, more than 1.7 million jobs have evaporated. Experts say it's hard to tell exactly how many people have no health insurance, but they have a rough idea. ""We are expecting about half the people who lost their jobs also lost their health insurance,"" said John Shield, senior vice president of the Lewin Group, a health-care policy research and management consulting firm. ""Our nation is facing a serious problem,"" said Christy Schmidt, senior director of policy at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. She said her organization saw between an increase of between 6 and 10 percent in the number of calls in December 2008 compared with December 2007. Many of the calls, she said, come from people who have lost their health insurance because they also lost their job. Rinchich did have a bit of a safety net. She was eligible for COBRA, which allows employees who leave a company to be covered under the company's health care plan for a year and a half. But the $368 she has to pay each month cuts deeply into her $900 monthly unemployment check. Rinchich's story is not unique. A study released earlier this month by Families USA found the average national premium costs for family COBRA coverage consume 84 percent of average unemployment benefits. For individuals it's about 30 percent. ""We need to get a grip on the issue,"" said Kathleen Stoll, deputy executive director of Families USA. She is optimistic that the provision in Obama's stimulus plan will help ease some of the strain. Under the new plan, she said, the federal government will pick up 65 percent of the cost of COBRA premiums. ""It's great. It's going to help a lot of folks,"" said Stoll, but she also said it has some limitations. Among other things, to be eligible, you must have lost your job after August 31, 2008. Unfortunately, the Obama COBRA plan won't help Rinchich since she lost her job at the beginning of 2008. She's not sure how much longer she will be able to pay for COBRA and is working with a cancer nonprofit to see if she can get help. So far, she owes close to $20,000. She cashed out her pension to pay her car note, mortgage and utility bills. ""But that's all gone now,"" she said. When she is feeling up to it, Rinchich looks for work as a dental assistant. She's now cancer free, but has more surgeries ahead. ""I just try to keep a positive attitude,"" she said, as she tries to figure out the next step.","For many Americans, job loss equals loss of health insurance .
In the last three months alone, more than 1.7 million jobs have evaporated .
Under the president's new plan, the government will cover part of COBRA costs .
Many Americans will have to wait for more complete health care reform ."
"(CNN) -- Maria Isabel Garcia doesn't get as many angry reactions to her work as she used to. For over ten years she has been one of the Philippines only science writers in a national newspaper, and during that time received her fair share of disparaging comments from readers in the devoutly Catholic country. Yet as the curator of The Mind Museum, the Philippines first modern, purpose-built science museum, her work now is a lot more palpable and potentially contentious than her newspaper column. ""So far I've had a few individuals with their own personal opinions on why we're not showing God at the same time we're showing the atom or beginning of the universe,"" she said. ""We explain that would be illogical in a science museum and they kind of concede and understand. Or at least I think they do."" After five years of planning, the 8,000 square meter purpose-built museum opened last month in an upscale, redeveloped area of Manila that would not look out of place in Singapore or San Francisco. Divided into five interlinked galleries, from ""The Atom"" all the way to ""The Universe"" and everything in between (described by Garcia as ""nature in scale""), the aim is to make science more accessible and inspiring to a new generation. Around 60% of children in the Philippines enroll in high school, but just 1% of those in their final year receive qualifications in math and physics, according to a 2008 report from the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. ""It's not secret, the Filipino public largely perceive science as very cold and should be left in labs, but science is too important to leave to scientists alone,"" said Garcia. ""In terms of concepts I made sure they are very fundamental. If we show nano-tech right away without telling the public that everything is made up of atoms they won't really get it."" Garcia's concepts were turned into 250 exhibits made by local artists in consultation with scientists. The fusion of art and science came with its own unique dynamic. ""I always told the artists making the exhibits 'You have to be correct first before you can be beautiful.'"" One artist wanted to move Hydrogen to the other side of the Periodic Table because he thought it looked lonely, while the hominids were made through email correspondence with a paleoanthropologist in France; the world's three recognized makers of cavemen were too expensive to bring in. The result is a lively, interactive museum with touches of Garcia's humor. Regularly displayed around the museum's open-plan two-floor interior are signs reminding visitors to read the signs: ""Reading is what makes humans unique. Please help us prove this every day."" Stuffy-sounding museum guides have been rebranded as ""Mind Movers"" (""the coolest geeks in town,"" says Garcia) whose job is to explain exhibits like the hominids and answer questions from the public. ""What surprised me was the surprise of the public that evolution makes sense,"" said Garcia. ""When our Mind Movers tell visitors about evolution they do understand and will say, 'That's it?' It is a big challenge, but it's not that our people are so unaccepting."" Send in your images and video from the Philippines . Raising money for a shiny new science museum in a country where over 30% of the population lives below the poverty line was another challenge. With no government funding, the not-for-profit operation enlisted the support of foundations and backing from businesses to raise the 1 billion pesos ($23.5 million) for the cost of the project. ""We were so new to fund-raising and that we didn't really realize we were asking for such huge amounts,"" said Manny Blas, the Mind Museum's director. Together Blas and Garcia make up the odd couple of popular science -- ""I make the money, she spends it,"" quips the laconic Blas -- and while Garcia has devoted her life to science, Blas is as well-versed in the gospels as he is corporate life. He holds a masters degree in theology and was the Southeast Asia president of U.S. food corporation Sara Lee for Southeast Asia until 2000. Compared to Garcia, he takes a more charitable view of the teaching of science in the Philippines but realizes more needs to be done to inspire the next Philippine Faraday. ""(Philippine students) don't score that well in sciences, we are one of the lowest internationally, and while we don't think the science museum will help solve that problem we think it's a step in the right direction. ""We do want to make an impact and show that science isn't something that should threaten you but should excite you and hopefully inspire Filipinos to take up science, engineering, technology and be an inventor in the future.""","The Mind Museum is the first modern science museum in the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- Islamist rebels in Nigeria on Monday released video of a French family kidnapped in neighboring Cameroon last week, leading France to blast the scene as one of ""cruelty without limits."" The seven-member family was flanked by armed fighters from the Boko Haram movement in the brief video. One of the captive men reads a statement demanding that Nigeria and Cameroon free jailed members of Boko Haram, which is battling to establish Islamic rule in northern Nigeria, and their families. ""Meet all the demands we have mentioned, and if you leave out one of them, we will kill these hostages,"" the masked man says. The family -- a couple, their four children and an uncle -- were seized in a national park in remote northern Cameroon on February 19. Authorities in Cameroon said they were quickly spirited across the border into Nigeria. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius denounced the video, saying, ""All of the state services are mobilized to free our countrymen."" ""For all of us, these images are terribly shocking. They demonstrate cruelty without limits,"" Fabius said in a statement released Monday afternoon. The kidnapping has raised fears of Westerners being targeted by Islamist militant groups in Africa in the wake of the French military intervention against other Islamist rebels in Mali. The masked man in the video says French President Francois Hollande ""started war against Islam, and we must fight him everywhere."" ""He also should learn that we have spread everywhere to save our oppressed brothers,"" the masked man adds. The father works for the French company GDF Suez and is based in Yaounde, the capital in southern Cameroon.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Central London fell silent save for the tolling of Big Ben as the United Kingdom honored the dead of wars past and present on Remembrance Sunday. Queen Elizabeth II then laid a wreath at the Cenotaph, the war memorial on Whitehall near Parliament, after a military band played the ""Last Post."" Other members of the royal family, including her husband, Prince Philip, and grandchildren Princes Harry and William, followed suit under steel-gray skies as Britain marked a tradition going back to the end of World War I. Harry was representing his father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, who is in Canada. Hours before the ceremony began, the Ministry of Defence announced the 200th British soldier had been killed in hostile action in Afghanistan. The soldier, from the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles, was killed in an explosion in Helmand province, the main British area of operations, in southern Afghanistan. That was then followed by the news that another soldier from 4th Battalion, The Rifles, died from injuries sustained in an explosion that happened in the same region near Sangin. Both soldier's families have been informed, the Ministry of Defence said. An American soldier was also killed in an insurgent attack in western Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. The event was not related to an ongoing search for two U.S. Army paratroopers, who went missing Wednesday near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan, ISAF said. The service member's name was not released. British troops also marked Remembrance Sunday in Afghanistan. The country honors war dead each year on the Sunday closest to November 11, the day World War I ended in 1918. The memorials this year come as many Britons question the country's military mission in Afghanistan. The UK has about 9,000 troops there, the second-largest contingent after the United States. Prime Minister Gordon Brown attempted to shore up support for the eight-year-old mission Friday. ""Our mission must not fail,"" Brown said. ""It is not easy, the choices are not simple, there is no strategy that is without danger and risk, but that is the responsibility of leadership of government and of our armed forces -- to do what is necessary, however difficult, to keep the British people safe. ""We cannot, must not, and will not walk away,"" Brown said. Sunday marked the first Remembrance Sunday since the death of the last two British World War I veterans living in the U.K., Harry Patch and Henry Allingham. Patch, 111, and Allingham, 113, died within a week of each other in July. Brown and other political leaders laid wreaths after the royal family at the Cenotaph, a memorial designed by the eminent early 20th-century architect Edward Lutyens. Diplomats from countries that used to be part of the British Empire followed, as did uniformed and civilian leaders of the British military. Rows of uniformed veterans stood on Whitehall for the service, wearing red paper poppies in their lapels. The Royal British Legion sells the paper poppies every year to raise money for veterans' causes. They are ubiquitous across the country in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Sunday. The ceremony lasted about 20 minutes from the moment of silence at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) through the singing of ""God Save the Queen"" after a short service led by the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres. After the royal family left the memorial, military veterans and members of the public also walked past the Cenotaph.","Queen Elizabeth II and Royal family lay wreaths at the Cenotaph, the war memorial near Parliament in London .

"(CNN) -- Cowering in a school restroom stall, young Charles D'Angelo would eat his lunch alone to escape classmates bullying him about his weight. A woman at his Catholic school's rectory let him watch the news with her during his break instead of playing outside. After losing 160 pounds, Charles D'Angelo got a shirtless picture of himself shown in Cosmopolitan. During high school, he got a doctor's note to excuse him from physical education. After years of overeating and under-exercising, he ballooned to around 360 pounds and felt depressed. But before-and-after photos he posted on iReport.com show how the St. Louis, Missouri, resident transformed himself from overweight teen to muscular man. Now a fitness coach, his mission in life is to make exercise fun so that kids will want to stay healthy. ""I'm not saying 'poor me,' but I went through a lot of pain and terrible days,"" D'Angelo said. ""I do believe that if my story can help others, then I'll do what it takes."" The need for better health habits seems greater than ever. More than 17 percent of youths ages 12 to 19 were estimated to be obese after a 2003-2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. That number was just 5 percent in the late 1970s. When D'Angelo was 17, he decided to get in shape. He initially focused on weightlifting and gym workouts to build up his muscles, calling the iPod one of the best products ever invented for those seeking to get fit. Growing up in an Italian family had taught him that food and emotions go together, whether at weddings or funerals. He used to munch on junk food during recess, but as he got older, he forced himself to eat planned, healthy meals. iReport.com: Shedding pounds, becoming a fitness coach . At 23 years old and a muscular 204 pounds, he has kept his excess weight off for five years and sports a rippling six-pack. He says he even got a shirtless photo of himself showcased in Cosmopolitan magazine. He hopes his success will make him a role model for obese kids, and he tries to come up with fun and supportive ways of exercising.  Watch iReporters 'dancasize' and show off fun workouts » . ""I was just scared to death of being tested or compared. I don't think we should measure people based on how many push-ups can you do, how many sit-ups can you do."" Keeping exercise fun and personally fulfilling is key to helping him stay with his workouts for the long haul. He enjoys watching TV while he works out. Boot camps and other group activities provide the camaraderie he craves. One of his clients owns a local gym that ""looks like an arcade,"" which he points to as an example of another way of giving exercise a better image. Wii Fit and Dance Dance Revolution stations are available. D'Angelo also said he feels he would have benefited from more-structured eating habits and routines as a child. Anything that gets the body moving can be good exercise, said Janet Fulton, a CDC epidemiologist. The government recommends the equivalent of 150 minutes of brisk walking or other moderate exercise per week. The time spent can change based on the intensity of the exercise. Fulton said regular workouts help ward off disease and keep weight stable over time. In combination with properly balanced nutrition and caloric intake, increased physical activity can help with weight loss. Whether exercise or nutrition are more responsible for increases in obesity over the last 30 years is unclear, Fulton said, but people seeking to lose weight should focus on both areas and pay attention to what they eat. She suggested doing an enjoyable exercise in the company of others. iReport.com: What's your fun exercise? ""Find a buddy, even if you're walking your dog. You cannot only do that, but do it with your family. Be a member of the team and get your social support that way."" Over time, D'Angelo developed confidence, and he says he wants to help others do the same. Dating seemed to be out of the question when he was heavier, but he now has a girlfriend. He says losing the weight and building his confidence have gone hand in hand. Many other iReporters said they also felt bad about exercise as kids and posted their own ideas for pleasurable alternatives that could help beat obesity. Staci Lambert-Westcott of Stephens City, Virginia, took up exercise and fitness to help manage the diabetes she was developing. Getting married and having children made maintaining her weight a challenge. When she got up to 247 pounds and at age 29, she decided to get fit.

When spring came, a neighbor thought Lambert-Westcott's husband had a new woman in his life. Throughout her personal weight-loss journey, she learned to get over her childhood dislike of exercise. As she lost pounds, she grew more comfortable exercising in public. Lambert-Westcott got to know the owner of her gym and eventually bought the business from him. She had always dreaded going to physical education class, so she tried to offer fun options for women when she was in charge. iReport.com: Bought the gym, lost 135 pounds . ""The classes were extremely popular because they were fun, and mom and daughter could come together. While mom was working out, daughter was working with a coach in the back."" Though she eventually sold the gym to go back to school, she continues to work out and maintain her healthy weight. Keeping the pressure off workouts is key, said fellow iReporter Jonathan Lund, 35, of Duluth, Minnesota. As a fitness trainer at a hospital, he works with everyone from elite athletes to patients at the facility. His experiences as an overweight teen helped show him how to help others be healthy. ""I have to remind myself, it took a lot of work to get these people out of the house and into this club,"" he said. He grew up self-conscious about excess weight and felt like he couldn't keep up with the other kids. Individual activities such as running helped him take off the weight. ""I never thought I could play sports or do anything like that. I always felt really intimidated by that. I also didn't like the aspect of team sports because it wasn't much of a workout because usually, you'd be sitting on the sidelines and you'd play for five minutes."" iReport.com: Lund stops to post an iReport at a marathon . He now runs marathons but got his start walking and increasing intensity little by little. He describes the long-distance events as ""addictive."" Along the way, Lund has battled a lot of negative thinking about himself. Despite the dozen or so marathons he's completed, including the Chicago Marathon on Sunday in Illinois and the recent Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lund's insecurities have stuck with him into adulthood. He pushes forward anyway. ""I still feel like a fat kid, even though I'm not anymore,"" he said. ""I feel like I have to keep running in order to keep up. But at the same time, it's the best therapy that there is. All that negative stuff gets worked out in your mind.""","Readers overcame childhood obesity, dislike of exercise through fun fitness .

"(CNN) -- Americans are forgoing medical attention in the face of high health-care costs, a new consumer health survey has found. The high cost of medical care and treatment has some sick people opting out of treatment, a survey finds. Specifically, 24 percent of people polled in the 2009 Deloitte Survey of Health Care Consumers decided not to seek medical care when they were sick or injured. The largest subgroups were those who were uninsured (36 percent), and those between ages 28 and 44, referred to as ""Gen Y"" respondents in the survey (37 percent). Two-fifths of the people who didn't see a doctor when they needed one did so because of the high cost of care. They either didn't have medical insurance coverage or they perceived the cost of such care to be excessive, according to the survey, which was released early Tuesday to CNN by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a nonpartisan, independent research center. ""Costs are impacting the system, and it's changing how we respond to our health care,"" said Paul Keckley, executive director of the center. In addition to data about how many Americans fail to seek necessary medical care because of high costs, another theme that emerged in the survey focused on consumers' dissatisfaction with the nation's health-care system: . • 94 percent of respondents said they believe health-care costs threaten their own financial security. • More than half said they think 50 percent or more of the money spent by Americans on health care is a waste. • Only 6 percent indicated their own family is totally prepared to shoulder the financial burden they expect to face. Not only are Americans putting off health care and facing increasing dissatisfaction, they are also shopping around for better deals on doctors' fees, prescription medication prices or health insurance plans to cut costs, according to the survey. There has been a lot of perceived loyalty and commitment in health care, Keckley said, and many providers think patients will stay with them. ""This study suggests that people really don't [stay],"" Keckley added. ""And that's surprising."" Despite the desire to shop around and gather more information to make improved decisions about their health-care choices, the abundance of options also can be baffling, says Kathleen Stoll, deputy director of Families USA. The group is a nonprofit, nonpartisan health care advocacy organization that regularly advises consumers on choosing insurance coverage plans. ""People weigh the costs of deductibles versus premiums, and these options can be confusing. They are asking themselves, 'What is it that I can afford in the family budget?' I sense a lot of people feeling unnerved by having to choose less [insurance] coverage because that's all they can afford,"" Stoll told CNN. The survey also underscored Americans' receptiveness to innovations that potentially lower costs and offer greater convenience, pointing toward growing preferences for options such as retail walk-in primary care clinics in drug stores, medical tourism (high-quality, relatively inexpensive medical procedures obtained abroad) and Web-based medical services (often referred to as e-visits). Sampling a nationally representative group of more than 4,000 adults using a Web-based questionnaire, the survey was funded by the center's parent company, Deloitte LLP, which has a wide range of clients in the health care industry. The center released its first version of the annual survey results in 2008. Last month, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation released its own health-care survey findings, with even greater numbers reflecting cutbacks in spending on medical services and treatments. According to the report, more than half of American households scaled back health-care spending in the previous 12 months before the survey, which was conducted in early February. Families relied on home remedies and over-the-counter medications instead of going to the doctor about 35 percent of the time, and they skipped visits to the dentist 34 percent of the time.","Survey finds 24% of respondents skip medical care when they're sick or injured .

"(CNN) -- Filipino boxing sensation Manny Pacquiao may be an eight-time world champion but he didn't have the skills to make it as an amateur. ""He tried his luck, but he wasn't good enough as far as we were concerned,"" says Manuel Lopez, the former president of the Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines and current Vice President of the Philippines Olympic Committee. ""He was very raw, with punches coming from over the shoulder; he was floating, in other words."" Lopez knew Pacquiao as a teenager before he developed into him one of the best pound-for-pound boxers of all time, and readily concedes that he did see he had great potential as a pro. Read more: Pacquiao squares up to the tax man . But Lopez -- and sport in the Philippines in general -- is now left in the strange situation where the most successful Filipino sportsperson ever has heightened interest in boxing but he could also be a reason for underachievement in the sport and other events at this year's Olympic Games. The hard-hitting success of Pacquiao has led to more Filipinos stepping into the ring, but many of them are seeking the potentially lucrative rewards of a professional career, rather than boxing as an amateur for national pride. ""The sport of boxing really is economy,"" says Lopez. ""Sad to say but the people who go into the sport of boxing are the less fortunate. In my experience all boxers that do active and competitive boxing are coming from the lower class hoping for greener pastures in the spot of boxing, as exemplified by Manny Pacquiao."" Send in your images from the Philippines . While not as successful as countries like Cuba, who traditionally have punched above their weight in terms of Olympic medals, the Philippines has won five Olympic boxing medals (out of a total of nine from all sports), with three of those coming from successive Games from 1988 to 1996. Pacquiao was an amateur when ""boxing in the Philippines was at the top of the hill,"" says Lopez, but since the 1990s heyday, medals from any sport, including boxing, haven't materialized. Funding is the main reason, bemoans Lopez, plus the increased difficultly in qualifying. Financial support from private companies and businesses in sponsoring sports associations helps, but can't entirely close the gap, says Lopez. Mark Anthony Barriga, a 19-year-old from the island of Mindanao, looks set to be the only Filipino boxer at this year's Olympics, but boxing coach Ronald Chavez sees plenty of potential in his gym. Chavez was an amateur boxer during the Philippines almost-golden patch -- two bronze medals and one silver -- between Seoul and Atlanta. After missing out on a medal himself at the Barcelona Olympic Games he eventually turned his hand to coaching in 1999. As one of the amateur boxing association's coaches, he runs the rule over 48 boxers -- 36 men and 12 women -- who take it in turns to spar and hit the well-stuffed punch bags each day in Manila's crumbling Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. Among Chavez's young tyros are a number of promising female boxers (this year's Olympic Games will be first that women's boxing is contested), and 16-year-old Eumir Marcial who became the country's first Word Junior Champion last year. ""He's good,"" says the understated Chavez, who, while hopeful the boxers in his gym will continue to develop in the national set-up, is realistic about why they are boxing. ""Well, they like to be like Manny (Pacquiao). Even my eight-year-old son, too,"" he says. Lopez remains optimistic that Barriga can win a medal in London and the likes of Marcial can develop into world-beaters, believing it takes around six years to make a champion boxer that could give the Philippines its first gold medal. ""Sport is a barometer for the nation's development. Sometimes we feel we are lacking because it's not a priority for the government. But for us sportspeople we do try and find a way to alleviate the plight of our predicament. We need fresh blood too, fresh minds, new ideas,"" he says. ""There's no shortage of raw talent here... given the right funding, knowledge and technology we will triumph.""","The Philippines has won nine Olympic medals, five have come from boxing .

"(CNN) -- A Marine is being investigated for potential legal or administrative proceedings after a video this week showed him in a profanity-loaded road rage against another motorist at Camp Pendleton, California, a Marines spokesman said Friday. The Marine, whose name, rank or unit weren't being released, was cited for communicating a threat in the incident, but he wasn't charged as of Friday, said Sgt. Christopher Duncan, a Camp Pendleton spokesman. The video, which went viral on the Internet, shows a young man yelling outside a truck, and he uses his hands and feet to wail on the truck whose driver sits calmly behind the wheel with the window rolled up. A woman passenger films the video. The video caption states there was an accident between the two vehicles in which the angry Marine's car was struck allegedly ""because of slamming on his brakes numerous times."" In the truck was a civilian driver and his passenger who is ""a fellow Marine who is in a wheelchair,"" the caption says. CNN affiliate KGTV reported that the driver is the caregiver to and brother of the woman Marine, who is paralyzed from the waist down. The cited Marine was released to a representative of his unit, and ""any further legal proceedings regarding this incident would be at the discretion of his unit, which is still gathering information,"" Duncan said in a statement. ""I have no information when potential legal or administrative proceedings would take place,"" Duncan said. ""This individual's behavior does not meet the standards that are expected of our Marines, and it has received the attention of senior base staff."" The incident took place Monday at about 2 p.m., Duncan said.","A Marine is cited with communicating a threat in a videotaped road rage incident .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Afghanistan's reputation as the world's leading narcotics supplier is well-known, but in a squalid ruin in Kabul, the country hides a darker secret -- a huge home grown drug addiction problem now on the brink of fueling an HIV/AIDS epidemic. Junkies smoking heroin can get high for $4. Here junkies lie in their own filth, wasted limbs poking out of blood-spattered clothing as they blank out the abject misery of their surroundings. In one room, a veritable narcotics bazaar offers pills and drug paraphernalia -- with hits retailing at less than $4. One user claims he has been an addict for 22 years, although it is difficult to talk to any of the dazed and ragged occupants of the drug rooms. The atmosphere is edgy and -- as thick clouds of burning opium fill the air -- dizzyingly toxic. The Kabul den is just the tip of the iceberg in a country awash with narcotics. The government estimates the number of addicts in Afghanistan could be as many as five percent of its 25 million people.  Watch Nic Robertson's report from the 'house of hopelessness' » . And though nascent efforts are being made to tackle the problem, chronic funding shortfalls have prompted the United Nations to warn that drug use will escalate, potentially driving an HIV/AIDS crisis as junkies move from smoking to high risk needle-sharing. Afghanistan has always been a major narcotics supplier -- responsible for 95 percent of the world's heroin -- although this was scaled back under the rule of the Taliban, which outlawed poppy cultivation and imposed strict penalties for drug users. Since 2001, when the extremist regime was ousted by a U.S.-led invasion that installed President Hamid Karzai, production has doubled. And for many in the country still mired in poverty and conflict, these cheap drugs offer a tempting escape. The last United Nations survey of Afghanistan's drug problem four years ago estimated the country's addicts to number about 200,000. According to Afghan Counter Narcotics Minister Khodaidad, the figure is now far greater. ""More than 1.2 million people in Afghanistan are addicts. It's a very huge number and every year it increases,"" he told CNN. Khodaidad says the Afghan government is largely powerless to control the production of opium while Taliban extremists, who now control and draw funding from drug crops, control cultivation areas despite major international military efforts to push them back. ""We did very little due to weakness of governors, due to insurgents, due to pressure of terrorism in the area,"" he added. ""We don't have sufficient law enforcement agencies -- the police, the border security force, and other special forces to control this area -- so it will take time."" But, says Jean-Luc Lemahieu, head of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul, time is something Afghanistan does not have. As intravenous drug use takes hold, raising the prospect of needle sharing, he says HIV/AIDS will follow quickly. ""The little data we have at the moment are very alarming,"" he told CNN. ""They tell us that we should not wait longer and if not, this country will be saddled with another burden it just can not afford. ""I think it is already happening today. We have seen, now, a few HIV/AIDS cases. Hopefully we can contain the problem, although it is unlikely given the problems with the health structures."" The U.N. has begun a program to detox users willing to get off drugs in Afghanistan. A renovated warehouse in Kabul offers hope to 100 addicts in the biggest facility of its kind in the country.  Watch Robertson go inside the detox clinic » . In the center's clean, bare rooms, shaven-headed junkies tremble under blankets as they go through the agonizing cold turkey of weaning their ravaged bodies off drug dependency. Therapy sessions also help motivate them to kick their deadly habit. ""Here we deal with the problem from a humanitarian perspective, not from an addiction perspective, to save lives,"" says Jehan Zeb Khan, UNODC program manager. But says Khan, with what little funding there is now dwindling fast, the salvation offered to these lucky few may be short lived -- they will be forced back out on the streets, where more opium dens will flourish, bringing yet more misery for Afghanistan.","Government officials say 1.2 million Afghans are now addicted to drugs .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- As a journalist, as a human being, the stories of the people around you stick with you. Whether it is in passing memory or in daily wonderment, they are in your mind and many in your heart, engrained forever. CNN's Atia Abawi, center, with Banafsha (denim jacket) and her siblings and mother. The first story I worked on for CNN in Afghanistan back in November, just as we were opening our new bureau in Kabul, was on a girl who attended a school for street kids called Aschiana. Aschiana, which means ""nest"" in Dari, was a place for the nearly 60,000 street kids in the capital city to escape from their terrible reality and get an education. There, we met Banafsha, an 11-year-old girl who along with her two younger sisters would beg on the streets for bread, feeding their family of eight. Her mother would stay home and take care of her baby brothers and their father, she told us, was a heroin addict. Banafsha was young in age but her eyes told of experiences that have taken her far beyond childhood. In our conversations, she spoke with candor and honesty, not allowing emotions to creep in. Until when, she told me that she prayed everyday for a change in her life.  Watch Abawi's first story on Banafsha » . ""I say, 'God take me out of this poverty and have my father go work so I can go to school,'"" she said, wiping away one lonely tear. The story received a tremendous response from viewers and readers after it was posted on CNN.com. An organization from the U.S. began to sponsor Banafsha, promising to provide for her. This was great to hear, but it didn't stop me from worrying. Did I bring her more trouble or was she going to be okay? Every time we would drive around the neighborhood, I would look for her to see if she was among the other street beggars. Were they suffering in the winter cold? Did they have enough food? About a week ago, I went to the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force with our cameraman Charlie Miller. As we were leaving, we met three little street kids, a sweet girl among them with a beautiful smile -- which made me think of Banafsha and her sisters. The sight of kids begging always breaks my heart because I know that their childhoods are forever stolen by poverty. I am also always scared to give them money because I remembered a story Banafsha told me about her little sister. She was given two dollars by an American, and when the American walked away, an older boy came and punched her 7-year-old little sister in the face, knocking her out. When she woke up, her money was gone. As we were driving away from those children and the smile on the girl's face, I shared the story with our driver and told him that I wished I knew how Banafsha was doing now. On our way home we decided to stop at a DVD shop, part of our limited entertainment living in Kabul. After making my selection, I walked out and I heard a beggar girl with a familiar smile on her face exclaim, ""You came over to our house!"" There was a girl next to her in a yellow dress also beaming with the same indistinguishable smile, lugging a bag of leftover pieces of bread over her tiny back.  Watch Abawi reunite with Banafsha and her family » . It was Banafsha's little sisters: 10-year-old Samira and 7-year-old Tamina. I was so excited to see them and even happier that they recognized me. But I was at the same time dejected that they were still on the streets. They told me that they go to school but they still beg on the streets. However, Banafsha is at home and no longer begging. We went home with them because I wanted to see Banafsha and her mother. On the way to their house in the middle of a Kabul graveyard, Samira told me that her dad left again three days ago and they have no clue where he is. As Samira went to go get her mother, who was nearby at their grandmother's home, her little brother called Banafsha for us. She came out of a little room in the backyard, used for the wintertime. It holds what is called a ""sandalee,"" a table heated by coal that is used by the more impoverished in Afghanistan to stay warm in the torturously cold winter. Banafsha looked drained, her eyes heavy with burden. I heard a baby crying from the room she just left, which had to be her little brother Ajmal. If it was true that she was not begging anymore I knew she was still carrying the weight of her family on her tiny shoulders. She was wearing a denim jacket and new dress. The family told me that the organization that has promised to help has been there twice so far, bringing Banafsha clothes and some cooking supplies for the family. They said they were grateful for the help Banafsha was getting but there were still difficulties. Banafsha was quiet and didn't talk much, but she had her rare moments when a smile would creep out. Those moments were like a glimmer of light in a dark room to me. The entire family had that same smile, but it was Banafsha's and her mother's that were the most infrequent. As we were about to leave, I asked about their health and the mother said everything was fine except for something on Banafsha's arm. She pulled up her daughter's sleeve and showed us a thick forming rash. Banafsha told us it kept growing and it was itchy. Charlie pulled out his still camera and took a picture of it. He planned on showing it to a medical friend in the city for treatment. I did not want to say goodbye, but I also did not want to intrude anymore than we had. That day, seeing them, re-energized me in a way that I could not explain. In Afghanistan, you see a lot of misery, in the city of Kabul alone your heart sinks at every turn. The poverty, the destruction, the hopelessness and the loss of dignity for survival, is everywhere. You are grateful for what you have and how lucky you are, but you know it is not fair. Those feelings continue to weigh on your heart and mind, and they can add up. Some times you are strong about it, other times you feel weak. And as much as it pains you, you know you are lucky to see their lives, you know you have benefited from these people and from this place -- in ways you may never understand why.","Abawi meets Banafsha while doing a story about a school for street kids .

"(CNN) -- The wife of slain Colorado prisons chief Tom Clements told CNN Thursday that she refuses to be angry over the news that the parolee believed to have killed her husband was released from prison four years early because of a clerical error. Court officials admitted this week that an error allowed 28-year-old Evan Ebel -- the man authorities have linked to Clements' killing last month -- to be released in January. ""Much like the incident itself, I could become enraged. For the rest of my days, I could be angry that someone made a mistake and didn't capture what a judge conveyed,"" Lisa Clements told CNN's Anderson Cooper in her first interview since the March 19 shooting. ""But it won't bring Tom back, and then my life is in that and my ability to be a good mother to my children. So I choose not to make it a focus."" The error dates back to 2008 when Ebel pleaded guilty to punching a prison guard in the face while serving an eight-year sentence for armed robbery and menacing. A judge ordered him to serve another four years consecutively, but a court clerk entered the sentence as concurrent, according to documents and court officials. 2 men questioned as Colorado manhunt continues . Authorities believe Ebel rang the doorbell of Clements home and opened fire when Clements opened the front door. Lisa Clements said she and her daughters, Rachel and Sarah, are praying for ""our ability to forgive."" ""I think it's not perhaps a point in time thing. I think it's something we grow into,"" she said. Fighting back tears, Clements' wife and two daughters described a loving family man who was more than just his job description. Associate of suspected Colorado killer arrested . ""I see him as my dad. He was my hero. He intervened in my life so many times, and he really changed my path. I just want people to know that, that he's my dad,"" Sarah Clements said. His daughter, Rachel, said: ""I would like people to see how he lived his life, and that is so much more important than how he died. He lived his life with such passion and compassion for other people."" Clements and his wife met at age 19 while both were studying sociology. Lisa Clements said she was drawn to her husband because of his compassion, his desire to help people. ""At a very early age, that was very interesting to me,"" she said. The family told CNN that they are trying to move beyond the actions that led to Clements' killing. That's due in part to stories Clements shared with them. Texas DA, wife remembered at memorial service . Often, the prisons chief met with victims of crime. Many told him how their lives had been ruined by violence, and they were unable to forgive the perpetrator. But some of the victims told Clements they had to move past it, they had to live their lives. ""It would just be the ultimate tragedy, if Tom's life were this horrific end and my life was destroyed by it,"" Lisa Clements said. She has taken comfort from a passage from scripture that says ""when darkness overtakes the godly, light comes bursting through."" ""That horrific night, and the sound of that doorbell and all that happened was just unmentionable darkness,"" she said. ""I trust that people will see light coming through, that they will see a man lived a good life and people's lives were impacted by that.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The one-star general almost yells when asked to talk about the infamous Abu Ghraib photos showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees. An Iraqi detainee grips a fence at Camp Cropper, one of the few U.S. detention centers remaining in Iraq. ""If we had had a company commander doing what he was supposed to be doing, a battalion commander doing what he was supposed to be doing ...,"" Brig. Gen. David Quantock said. He carried on -- growing more and more angry. So the next obvious question was, ""It makes you angry?"" ""It does make me angry,"" he said. ""Because I think we lost a lot of American lives because of those photos."" And there it is -- the issue of detainee abuse and what the U.S. military struggles with, and has struggled with, since the release of those photos in 2004, some of which showed naked prisoners being humiliated, stacked in piles or subjected to mock torture. Quantock, the head of detainee operations in Iraq, is echoing a debate raging in Washington. Another round of photos allegedly showing further abuse of prisoners was to be released by the end of this month. But President Obama asked that the photos be held back. Obama said he believed the release of the pictures could put American lives in danger. That is Catch-22 situation No. 1: on one hand transparency; on the other, the safety of U.S. troops. Quantock agreed with his commander in chief. ""The jihadists have used those pictures. And it has spurred some of the violence,"" he said. Walking through Camp Cropper -- one of the last remaining U.S. detention centers in Iraq -- it is clear the damaging photos have forced the United States to become more transparent in its dealings with prisoners. Detainees are now checked before and after interrogations to ensure the guards have not abused them. Officers who walk the catwalk, the long metal walkway that surrounds the sprawling yard housing the detainees, have more oversight. These institutional checks reduce the possibility that abuse could reach the same scale as it did in Abu Ghraib in 2003. The camp itself has a strange feeling to it. Visitors are told to put on sunglasses before entering some of the holding areas. Many of the detainees spit and even throw their own fecal matter at the guards, officials said. Inmates in American detention with arrest warrants against them will be turned over to Iraqi authorities under the terms of the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement. All others will be released. But the United States has signed the international treaty against torture, which compels a nation to keep suspects detained rather than send them to another country if that other country might ill-treat them. ""Iraqi detention facilities are not good; they are not like American facilities,"" said a woman who had just visited her detainee husband at Camp Cropper. ""There is a lot of witness testimony from detainees who suffered maltreatment in Iraqi detention facilities."" A U.N. report examining the second half of 2008 agreed, saying that detention centers run by Iraqis are using torture and physical abuse to extract confessions. The lingering questions about Iraqi detention facilities create Catch-22 situation No. 2. The United States very much wants not only to get out of Iraq, but to get out of the detainee operation business. But it has a legal bar to satisfy. For its part, the U.S. military said it is inspecting and monitoring nine of the Iraqi facilities where its detainees will go. Iraqi government authorities maintain that they are treating all prisoners in accordance with international law. But when the United States pulls its last troops form Iraq, the monitoring is likely to stop. Nongovernmental organizations have been denied access, and CNN recently has not been allowed into any Iraqi prison.","U.S. head of detainee operations in Iraq is angered by Abu Ghraib photos .

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon has revolutionized warfare during the past decade, making unmanned aerial vehicles, known as UAVs, a staple of modern combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. A USAF technician at Creech Air Force Base, checks Hellfire missile attachments on a Predator. Remotely-controlled drones, such as the Predator and the Reaper, have allowed the U.S. military to spy on and attack enemy combatants without putting their own forces at risk, thereby making UAVs a must-have. ""The real advantage of unmanned aerial systems is they allow you to project power without projecting vulnerability,"" says USAF Lt. Gen. David Deptula at the Pentagon.   But as USAF commanders try to provide enough pilots to take charge of drones, many are considering another aspect of the warfare revolution -- the psychological impact on those controlling the vehicles. As Dr. Kory Cornum, a USAF colonel, explains: ""Whereas we have thousands of years of data on what it's like to go to war really, we only have a few years of data on what it's like to go to war virtually. And so we don't have really enough data."" Pilots are now dealing with something never experienced before -- a rapid transition from intense combat to home comfort, often in less than an hour. Some describe it as a version of post-traumatic stress disorder, often more associated with soldiers directly in harm's way. Peter Singer, an adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama's campaign team and author of ""Wired for War,"" described one encounter with a frustrated non-commissioned officer. ""She actually banged the table, saying: 'No one is paying attention to this issue of PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] among my men and women, no one's paying attention to it,"" Singer says. ""And she talked about a scene where they were flying a drone above a set of U.S. soldiers that were killed and the drone was unarmed at the time and they couldn't do anything about it. They just circled above and they watched U.S. soldiers die in front of them.""  Watch the debate about the impact of UAVs on pilots » . USAF fighter pilots like Major Morgan Andrews remotely control drones from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. Less than an hour after targeting he'll be back in suburban Las Vegas, his drive home more physically dangerous than the combat mission he has just undertaken. Commanders at Creech say that if there is stress, it comes from relentless around-the-clock shift work. Andrews says that like any good pilot he has learned to compartmentalize his life, using his commute to and from work to transition.

I just kind of go through it and usually, by the time I get home, I've sorted it all through my mind and stick it away in a file and go on with life."" For Andrews, fighting from Nevada more than outweighs the drawbacks of long overseas deployments, allowing him to enjoy life at home with his family and friends. Cornum adds that the drive home is more of a blessing than anyone realized. ""It does give you some amount of time, as opposed to if you lived on base and you could literally walk out of war and into your house,"" he says. ""I don't know if 30 minutes is enough. But it gives you time to decompress."" But conducting remote warfare, as Cornum explains, brings with it stress that vary from those usually experienced by troops. ""The big difference is that when you are actually deployed, you are with all your battle buddies who are experiencing the thing 24/7. Whereas when you go home, you go home to your family, to your neighbors, who are not in the battle all the time. And that's good and bad.""","Robotic warfare allows pilots to control armed vehicles without risk to themselves .

"(CNN) -- Some might say that Scott Schreck ruined his family's vacation, but he also redeemed himself. The father's wrong turn got his family lost in the Florida Everglades, but his outdoor skills helped steer rescuers to their location. The Schreck family -- Scott, Carrie and their three young boys -- spent a night in the swampy wilderness Thursday in an ecosystem home to alligators, snakes and mosquitoes. The five passengers had set out that day for a tour in the Everglades in a borrowed airboat, but a wrong turn placed them in an unplanned adventure. The airboat became stuck in vegetation and couldn't be turned around. ""This is the first time I've been out here, so obviously I'm a novice on this body of water. Not the thing to do,"" Schreck told CNN affiliate WPLG. Earlier, the Seville, Ohio, family had enjoyed a fun time fishing for bass and taking photos of alligators. Once they got stuck, leisure time turned to survival time. The avid outdoorsman hacked down some cypress trees to make a lean-to. ""We had a whole bunch of life jackets. (We) put it on top to keep the rain off,"" Schreck said. It was a rainy and cold night, and the family -- who were wearing only T-shirts and shorts -- huddled close for warmth. ""It was kinda cold and wet, we didn't really go to sleep at all, and there were lots of mosquitoes,"" 9-year-old Luke Schreck told WPLG. ""I was kind of scared. I didn't know when we were going to get out."" His brothers are 7 and 3 years old. When the Schrecks did not return from their trip on Thursday, concerned family members called the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Numerous local agencies aided in the search with airboats and aerial observation. The dense vegetation and camouflage airboat that the Schrecks used made the rescue difficult, officials said. ""It's like looking for a needle in a haystack,"" Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokesman Lt. Arnold Piedrahita Jr. told WPLG. In addition to building the shelter, the Schrecks fired a flare into the night, and in the morning used air horns and whistles to make noise that ultimately led to their rescue. ""We weren't able to see them, we were only able to hear them,"" Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino told the affiliate. The family was examined and released from a local hospital. The next order of business, Luke Schreck said, was to get some sleep. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","The Schreck family went on an airboat tour of the Everglades .

"(CNN) -- In September of 2006, President Bush announced that 14 suspected terrorists who were being held in CIA custody had been transferred to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Alleged 9/11 planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was held in secret and moved to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The men were to be tried before military tribunals. U.S. officials have said the suspects are linked to terrorist plots -- both successful and thwarted. Those terror plots include the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali, the September 11, 2001, attacks, the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen and the 1998 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania. During a news conference acknowledging the transfer of these prisoners, Bush told reporters what set them apart from other U.S. captives. ""These are dangerous men with unparalleled knowledge about terrorist networks and their plans for new attacks,"" said Bush. He said ""questioning the detainees in this program has given us information that has saved innocent lives by helping us stop new attacks -- here in the United States and across the world.""  Bush said the prisoners would be questioned at the Guantanamo prison ""subject to the new U.S. Army Field Manual"" and ""they will continue to be treated with the humanity that they denied others."" ""I want to be absolutely clear with our people, and the world: The United States does not torture,"" said Bush. ""It's against our laws, and it's against our values. I have not authorized it -- and I will not authorize it."" Although President Obama has promised to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, prisoners there still face military tribunals. One of the 14 men has been moved from Guantanamo to U.S. soil and is being tried in federal court.","In '06, suspected terrorists in CIA custody moved from secret prisons to Gitmo .

"HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- Four Chinese nationals of Uyghur ethnicity who had been held at the U.S. military's Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility have been resettled in Bermuda, officials said Thursday. Attorney General Eric Holder says the U.S. is ""extremely grateful to the government of Bermuda."" ""Above all, this was a humanitarian act,"" Bermudan Premier Ewart Brown told CNN in an interview at his Cabinet office in Hamilton, Bermuda. ""We don't see it as quid pro quo."" The four were twice cleared for release -- once by the Bush administration and again this year, according to a Justice Department statement. They were among 17 Uyghur detainees at the facility set up to hold terror suspects. The four were flown by private plane Wednesday night from Cuba to Bermuda and were accompanied by U.S. and Bermudan representatives as well as their attorneys, according to Susan Baker Manning, part of the men's legal team. President Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility, raising questions of what will happen to the more than 200 remaining detainees. A political backlash against bringing any of the detainees to the United States has increased the focus on sending them to other countries. Brown said he read an article on the issue of the Guantanamo Bay detainees' fates in The Washington Post while he was in Washington for a White House meeting in May. He said he decided to put an offer to the U.S. government ""on the table."" He said Bermuda, a British colony, told London of its intentions, but not until late in the process. Britain must approve the transfer for it to be permanent, Brown said, adding that he believes the issue may raise tension between Bermuda and Britain. The issue is controversial because of China's opposition to the Uyghurs being sent to any country but China. Uyghurs are a Muslim minority from the Xinjiang province of far-west China. The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement. They left Afghanistan after U.S. bombings began in the area in October 2001 and were apprehended in Pakistan, the statement said.  Watch concerns about resettling the Uyghur detainees » . ""According to available information, these individuals did not travel to Afghanistan with the intent to take any hostile action against the United States,"" the statement said. Manning said the 17 were picked up as a matter of circumstance and never had terrorist training. They left China because they did not agree with the government, she told CNN. However, China alleges the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement -- a group the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization -- that operates in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang. China on Thursday urged the United States to hand over all 17 of the Uyghurs instead of sending them elsewhere. The Chinese statement followed an offer by Palau, a Pacific island nation, to accept the Uyghur detainees. The Xinjiang region of 20 million people is largely populated by ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities who have traditionally opposed Beijing's rule and clamored for greater autonomy. A senior U.S. administration official told CNN the State Department is working on a final agreement with Palau to settle the matter of the 13 remaining Uyghur detainees. Issues to be worked out include how to transfer the Uyghurs to Palau and how much money the United States would give the men for resettlement, the official said. The official said the average in such cases is $100,000 per person. The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities. China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured. Palau said it will take in the ethnic Uyghur detainees for humanitarian reasons and because of the ""special relationship"" between Palau and the United States. Palau, with a population of about 20,000, is about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) southeast of Manila in the Philippines and about 4,600 miles (7,400 kilometers) west of Hawaii. It has received nearly $900 million in U.S. aid since independence in 1994, according to congressional auditors, and depends on Washington for its defense. In 2006, five other Uyghur detainees were transferred to Albania, according to the Justice Department, which said it has no reports they took part in any post-resettlement criminal behavior or terrorist activities. Since 2002, more than 540 detainees have departed Guantanamo for other countries, including Albania, Algeria, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, France, Great Britain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom and Yemen, the Justice Department said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday said his claim that enhanced interrogation techniques -- including waterboarding -- produced critical post-9/11 information was supported by a pair of intelligence reports released last week. Former VP Dick Cheney says enhanced interrogation techniques persuaded subjects ""to cooperate."" ""The enhanced interrogation techniques were absolutely essential in saving thousands of American lives,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" However, the two dossiers that were declassified at Cheney's request do not disclose what kinds of techniques were used to elicit the intelligence. The only method occasionally cited by the reports is a routine one -- using information from one detainee to gain details from another. The two reports surfaced as the latest ammunition in the debate over whether the use of controversial interrogation techniques like stress positions, wall slamming, and waterboarding -- considered torture by critics -- helped prevent terrorist attacks. Cheney said the reports prove that two top al Qaeda suspects, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Zubayda, ""were uncooperative at first."" But ""the application of enhanced interrogation techniques, specifically waterboarding -- especially in the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- is what really persuaded him he needed to cooperate,"" Cheney said . A U.S. government official with knowledge of the interrogation program told CNN that while the chronology is not spelled out in the two reports, Mohammed's information became ""more voluminous and accurate"" after he was exposed to waterboarding 183 times. The official declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the subject. Zubaydah also talked more after being subjected to waterboarding, according to a third document -- a 2004 CIA inspector general's report that was released last week. ""It is not possible to say definitively that the waterboard is the reason for Abu Zubaydah's increased production,"" says the report, ""or if another factor, such as the length of detention, was the catalyst. Since the use of the waterboard, however, Abu Zubaydah has appeared to be cooperative."" It also says that before his waterboarding, Mohammed provided little information. But the report is cautious on whether the enhanced interrogation techniques, or EITs, approved by the Bush administration helped the interrogation program get results. ""There is no doubt the program has been effective,"" the 2004 report says. ""Measuring the effect of the EITs, however, is a more subjective process and not without some concern."" The CIA report also does not say whether the techniques -- which have since been banned -- were the only way to get the detainees to talk. ""The effectiveness of particular interrogation techniques in eliciting information that might not otherwise have been obtained cannot be so easily measured,"" it says. And one of Zubydah's interrogators, former FBI special agent Ali Soufan, told a Senate hearing in May that waterboarding him was unnecessary. Any useful information interrogators got from him either was or could have been produced without ""enhanced"" techniques, he said. Soufan said Zubaydah stopped talking after CIA contractors took over and began using harsh techniques, which he testified were ""ineffective, slow and unreliable, and harmful to our efforts to defeat al Qaeda."" Zubaydah was subjected to waterboarding 83 times in August 2002, according to Bush administration documents released in April; Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times in March 2003, according to the documents. U.S. authorities prosecuted Japanese officers who used waterboarding against American prisoners in World War II. But Bush administration lawyers argued the tactic did not violate U.S. laws against torture as long as interrogators had no intent to cause ""severe pain."" Cheney said in May that the interrogations were used only on ""hardened terrorists"" after other efforts failed -- and ""in a few cases, that information could be gained only through tough interrogations."" And there was also time pressure, the U.S. official with knowledge of the interrogation program told CNN. ""Time was deemed to be of essence. There was fear of a pending attack"" in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. ""Could you have gotten the information some other way? We'll never know,"" said Peter Bergen, CNN terrorism analyst, who doubts the information divulged after waterboarding saved American lives. ""Did it really avert imminent terrorist attacks, according to these documents? No,"" he said. ""Khalid Sheikh Mohammed certainly revealed a lot of information after being waterboarded ... but it turns out these plots were just talk."" But Cheney said enhanced interrogations contributed to most of the successful arrests of al Qaeda members. ""I think they were directly responsible for the fact that for eight years we had no further mass casualty attacks against the United States,"" he said Sunday. CNN's Pam Benson and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Cheney says reports support claim that enhanced interrogation produced critical info .

"HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- The Obama administration's agreement with Bermuda to settle four Uyghurs from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was causing a rift Friday between the United States and its strongest ally, Britain. Bermuda's premier, Ewart Brown, calls accepting the four Uyghurs from Guantanamo Bay ""a humanitarian act."" Also Friday, the U.S. Justice Department announced five other Guantanamo detainees -- one from Iraq and one from Chad and three from Saudi Arabia -- had been transferred to their home countries. Iraqi national Jawad Jabber Sadkhan was sent to Iraq on Thursday night, and Chadian national Mohammed El Gharani went to Chad early Friday, the department said. The Saudi men are expected to be taken to a re-education center where previous Guantanamo detainees have been held, one U.S. official said.  Watch rare interview with the ex-detainees » . The men were identified as Khalid Saad Mohammed, Abdalaziz Kareem Salem al Noofayaee and Ahmed Zaid Salim Zuhair. The transfer of the prisoners brings to 10 the number of prisoners who have been removed from the U.S. military prison in recent days, as the Obama administration attempts to move toward closure of the facility by January. A UK official familiar with the agreement on the Uyghurs but not authorized to speak publicly told CNN the United States informed the British government of the agreement ""shortly before the deal was concluded."" The official said, ""We feel we should have been consulted"" before the deal was struck between the United States and the British ""overseas territory."" A U.S. official, on background, said the British feel blindsided. Bermuda's government said Thursday the four had been resettled in Bermuda. ""Above all, this was a humanitarian act,"" Bermudian Premier Ewart Brown said. Bermuda's opposition party has called for a no-confidence vote in the House of Assembly, which could lead to Brown's ouster. The vote was tabled until next week. On the issue of the Uyghurs, the British official said that by law Bermuda decides many day-to-day issues,  and ""it seems to have been a decision Bermudian authorities made based on their immigration responsibility."" However, the British government is responsible for decisions on defense and foreign policy. Bermuda ""should have consulted the UK government,"" he said. With the Uyghurs already in Bermuda without travel documents, the UK is helping the Bermudian government carry out a security assessment, he said. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said, ""We understand that there are some concerns about some of the details of the resettlement, and we're confident that we can work these things through with the government of the UK."" ""I don't think we bypassed anyone,"" Kelly added. The four were twice cleared for release -- once by the Bush administration and again this year, according to a U.S. Justice Department statement. They were among 17 Uyghur detainees at the facility set up to hold terror suspects. The four flew by private plane Wednesday night from Cuba to Bermuda, accompanied by U.S. and Bermudian representatives as well as their attorneys, according to Susan Baker Manning, part of the men's legal team. The men, who are staying in an apartment, were free to roam about the island. They can't leave the country because they have no passports. President Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility, raising questions of what will happen to the more than 200 remaining detainees. A political backlash against bringing detainees to the United States has increased the focus on sending them to other countries. The Justice Department on Friday said the two detainees from Chad and Iraq were approved for transfer after the Guantanamo Review Task Force looked at their cases. A federal court also ordered the U.S. government in January to take all necessary and appropriate steps to facilitate the Chadian national's release. ""As our review of detainees continues, the support of the international community is critical to the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and the security of our country,"" said Matthew Olsen, executive director of the task force. ""We are grateful for the cooperation of the governments of Iraq and Chad and for their assistance on the successful transfer of these individuals."" Since 2002, more than 540 detainees have departed Guantanamo for other countries, including Albania, Algeria, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, France, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom and Yemen, the Justice Department said.

"(CNN) -- Roger Ebert was seldom at a loss for words. His debates with Gene Siskel, his longtime co-host on a succession of movie-review television shows, sometimes seemed to start before the introduction and often appeared to continue well after the credits rolled. He wrote reviews, columns, interviews and articles, an astonishing collection of work that spanned more than four decades with the Chicago Sun-Times, freelance contributions for magazines such as Esquire, CD-ROMs (Ebert's movie guide was one of the sources for the popular Cinemania) and rogerebert.com. He hosted festivals for underappreciated films. He gave running travelogues from Cannes and Toronto. He tweeted, Facebooked, corresponded with film lovers and held court with words long after his physical voice was silenced by cancer a decade ago. Ebert lost his battle with cancer Thursday. He was 70. What a voice he had: firm, plain, brooking no claptrap and telling you exactly what he thought, a throwback, he said, to his newspaper reporter days. (Chicago, then and now, was full of such cheerily blunt personalities: Mike Royko, Irv Kupcinet, Studs Terkel -- perhaps to be expected in the birthplace of ""The Front Page."") Opinion: Ebert's sheer love of life . Above all, he was easy to relate to. Like many of his readers, I didn't always agree with Ebert, but I could understand his viewpoint. He understood movies were these complex machines of directors and actors and special effects guys and studio suits holding bags of money, machines that -- when they worked -- were magical, like dreams. And when they didn't, he could be a compassionate man, more forgiving than many other critics. Unless he felt as if the filmmakers had betrayed the arrangement between them and the audience. Then, watch out, because he would say what many of us might want to. When Vincent Gallo, the writer-director of the Ebert-panned ""The Brown Bunny,"" called Ebert a ""fat pig with the physique of a slave trader,"" Ebert retorted, ""One day I will be thin, but Vincent Gallo will always be the director of 'The Brown Bunny.' "" He titled one of his books ""I Hated, Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie"" (a line from his review of ""North,"" a Rob Reiner misfire) and another ""Your Movie Sucks"" (the closing phrase to an open letter he wrote actor Rob Schneider). However, Ebert was as fast -- if not faster -- to give praise. He and Siskel panned the 1987 Christopher Reeve movie ""Street Smart,"" but both highlighted the performance of a then-little known actor named Morgan Freeman, who played a pimp. Freeman was nominated for an Oscar, with Siskel and Ebert's praise probably playing a key role, since the film came and went quickly. And when Gallo recut ""The Brown Bunny,"" Ebert went to see it again -- and this time, he gave it a coveted ""thumbs-up."" ""The film's form and purpose now emerge from the miasma of the original cut, and are quietly, sadly, effective. It is said that editing is the soul of the cinema; in the case of 'The Brown Bunny,' it is its salvation,"" he wrote. Opinion: What the Internet owes to Roger Ebert . Thumbs-up . The fact that such controversies could make headlines emphasizes the importance of Roger Ebert to the movies, especially now that we live in a pop culture where everybody's a critic. There had been film critics on TV before Siskel and Ebert -- Judith Crist and Gene Shalit among them -- and film criticism had existed since the dawn of the medium. But it was generally taken seriously only by cinephiles, the folks who followed The New Yorker's Pauline Kael or The Village Voice's Andrew Sarris. Siskel and Ebert made it approachable. Both were Midwesterners, a notable point at a time when most film criticism came from the coasts. And, through their TV show, the two approached film criticism the way movie fans, freshly released from a weekend showing at the cineplex, might talk about what they just saw. ""They turned talking about cinema into an American pastime,"" the Detroit Free Press' Julie Hinds wrote in tribute. Their success wasn't guaranteed. The pair -- forever immortalized as ""The Bald One"" (Siskel) and ""The Fat One"" (Ebert) -- worked for rival Chicago newspapers and were regularly at each other's throats before being paired on a review show, ""Opening Soon at a Theater Near You,"" in 1976. ""Professionally speaking, their daily aim was to bludgeon each other via newsprint, their medium/blunt object of choice,"" wrote Josh Schollmeyer in his wonderful Siskel-and-Ebert oral history, ""Enemies, A Love Story."" Siskel had great contacts; Ebert had a Pulitzer Prize, the first ever awarded a movie critic. Ebert kept us entertained 'At the movies' Their chemistry, however, was undeniable. And as ""Opening"" turned into ""Sneak Previews"" turned into ""At the Movies"" turned into ""Siskel & Ebert and the Movies,"" the two became equal parts knockabout vaudeville team -- frequently guesting on Johnny Carson and David Letterman's late-night shows, where their debates were very obviously unscripted -- and influential movie critics, willing to showcase all variety of new releases in a pre-Internet age when middle America wasn't besieged by all manner of movie minutiae and clips weren't a click away. They were, in a word, refreshing -- especially for those of us, like me, who grew up far from the film centers of New York and Los Angeles. Where else could you get a sense of movies that might never come to your town? Where else could you take part, even from your living room, in the debate between two guys who really knew their stuff, and were entertaining as hell to boot? The show's format was frequently copied, but Siskel and Ebert were the undisputed kings of the genre -- triumphant to the point where they trademarked their ""thumbs-up"" summary judgment. By the end, the two men had become almost like brothers -- competitive, yes, but also fiercely protective of each other. Siskel died in 1999, but reading Ebert's 2011 memoir, ""Life Itself,"" you'd think he was still around to needle his fellow critic. Remembering Ebert: Tweets pour in . The balcony is closed . Ebert changed with the times. He adapted to the Internet quickly, and though he continued with the TV show -- which moved from public TV to syndication in the 1980s -- it was obvious that the new medium was the right place for him. (Ebert finally left the show in 2008, though guest hosts had been filling in since 2006; it was canceled in 2010.) ""We don't sit down every Saturday night at 6:30 p.m. and wait for a show to come on television,"" television executive Mary Kellogg said in ""Enemies."" ""People want instant gratification; they want to read or see his review the moment they decide to go to a certain movie."" Ebert himself approved. ""I think that the Internet has provided an enormous boost to film criticism by giving people an opportunity to self-publish or to find sites that are friendly,"" he said. There were controversies here and there. Ebert was criticized for reviewing a film he'd only seen a portion of. Some of his readers believed he'd gone soft; just in the last few months, he gave at least three (out of four) stars to such panned films as ""Taken 2"" (21 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and ""Stand Up Guys"" (36 percent). But nobody denied his impact. He was widely quoted and widely recognized, perhaps the most famous film critic in the world. Ebert in his own words . These days, when pop culture runs through the very capillaries of the Internet, it's easy to knock film critics. Who are they to rain on our entertainment parade? Can't we just enjoy the view provided by ""Transformers 3"" without having to think about it? Ebert, as the top of the heap, probably heard his name associated with these thoughts more than most. What made him special was both his joy in the medium, and his unabashed enthusiasm in asking for something more. Go ahead and love movies, but give them some thought, too. He conveyed all this through his words -- his vital, incisive, energetic, determined words. He said it best himself. ""However you came to know me, I'm glad you did and thank you for being the best readers any film critic could ask for,"" he wrote in his last column, ""A Leave of Presence,"" published Tuesday. ""Thank you for going on this journey with me. I'll see you at the movies."" Lights down, please.","At a time when critics mostly hailed from the coasts, he was a Midwesterner people related to .

"(CNN) -- Rutgers men's assistant basketball coach Jimmy Martelli resigned the same day his boss was fired after ESPN broadcast a lengthy video of players being physically and verbally abused, the university told CNN on Thursday. Rutgers gave no reason for Martelli's resignation Wednesday. The outcry over the treatment of the players arose after ESPN on Tuesday showed footage of head coach Mike Rice shoving and berating players. ESPN reported Thursday that Martelli also was involved, in a handful of instances where he shoved players and at least one instance where he called a player ""a f**king fa**ot."" The network posted a different video on its website that showed Martelli getting physical with players and an interview with Eric Murdock, a former director of player development for the Scarlet Knights, who said Martelli was known as ""Baby Rice."" Martelli, son of longtime St. Joseph's coach Phil Martelli, joined the Rutgers staff in May 2010 after three seasons as an assistant under Rice at Robert Morris, which twice made the NCAA tournament. In a statement obtained by CNN, Martelli said, ""I am sickened that as an assistant coach I contributed in any way to an unacceptable culture. Wednesday I resigned from Rutgers and I hope that coaches on all levels will learn something important from these events. For my actions, I am deeply sorry and I apologize to the players from the bottom of my heart."" The news comes the same day Rutgers revealed the university will pay Rice a $100,000 longevity bonus, according to a university spokesman. Rice said after he was fired that ""there's no explanation for what's on those videos because there's no excuse for it,"" according to CNN affiliate WABC. ""I can't say anything right now except I'm sorry, and there will never be a time where I'm going to use any of that as an excuse or will there be any excuse,"" he said, according to the station. ""I've let so many people down, my players, my administration, Rutgers University, the fans, my family -- who's sitting in their house, just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them."" The video, which ESPN said features excerpts of practice sessions shot between 2010 and 2012, initially had earned Rice a three-game suspension, a $75,000 fine and a ticket to anger management classes. ""You f**king fairy ... you're a f**king fa**ot,"" Rice appears to say during one session depicted on the video, which also shows him shoving and throwing basketballs at players. Under pressure from incensed state officials to take stronger action, Athletic Director Tim Pernetti said Wednesday that he had made a mistake in favoring suspension. ""I am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice,"" Pernetti said in a written statement. ""Dismissal and corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong. Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community."" According to CNN affiliate WCBS, Pernetti said he had talked to Martelli about the video. ""Jimmy was spoken to about the matter,"" Pernetti told reporters Tuesday. ""We dealt with that. Certainly the tape focused on Mike, but it brought some other things to light that we dealt with at the same time that we dealt with Mike.""

"SHANGHAI, China (CNN)  -- If it weren't for the Internet, Murong Xuecun might still be working as a sales manager at a car company in the southern Chinese city of Chengdu. That is what he was doing when he started writing his first novel on his office's online bulletin board system back in 2001. The Internet is increasingly being seen in China as a tool for literary empowerment, analysts say. Week by week when he got home from work, Murong would post new pieces to a story that painted a bleak yet honest picture of modern urban life in the city where he lived. It contained tales about sex, love, gambling and drugs and became so popular that it soon appeared on numerous other online forums. Today the 35-year-old is considered one of the most famous authors to have emerged in contemporary China. His debut work, ""Leave Me Alone: A novel of Chengdu,"" has been read by millions of Chinese ""netizens"" -- steady Internet users -- and adapted for film and television and translated into German, French and English. He also is viewed as a pioneer of what has become nothing short of a literary renaissance online in the country, particularly among young Chinese writers. This is a constituency that has struggled to find a platform for their work in a publishing industry that is viewed as conservative as it often faces state censorship. Instead of remaining silent, a new generation of authors has found its voice on the Web. ""It is a very big revolution,"" said Yang Hengjun, a political espionage novelist who published his first work online. ""When you write something on the Internet that you can't do in reality and you cause a change, that is revolutionary."" The past decade has seen the blossoming of countless literary Web sites and online forums hosting stories from thousands of aspiring authors. Their work is read by millions of Internet users, leading some to assert that in the future all writing, even reading, in China will take place in cyberspace. ""It's an inevitable trend due to the rapid development of the Internet and conceptual change of people,"" said Hou Xiaoqiang, head of Shanda Literature, a division of Shanghai-based Shanda Interactive Entertainment, the largest online entertainment provider in China. ""Ordinary people have started to realize the world ought to be dominated by them, rather than some media or elite,"" Hou added. ""Online authors are breaking the rules and using totally fresh concepts."" Shanda Literature operates three of China's biggest literary portals, including Qidian, one of the most popular. Collectively, the Web sites receive more than 200 million daily page views and have published nearly 30 billion Chinese characters, according to Shanda Literature's company data. Shanda generates revenues through online advertising and by charging readers small amounts to access popular stories or works from famous authors who have been contracted to write. However, the company is increasingly trying to earn money by licensing online novels to film studios, music producers, game developers and book publishers while protecting the intellectual property rights of its authors. Shanda owns the rights to more than 200,000 works and has already sold a number of licenses to other entertainment companies, including a popular ""Tomb Raider"" novel that is being adapted for film by Hong Kong director Johnnie To Kei-Fung. ""Literature is the starting point of all means of entertainment,"" Hou told CNN. ""It can provide numerous blueprints for games, music, movies and dramas. A lack of good stories is the main reason of the underdevelopment of entertainment [in China]."" Many of China's usually young and often female cyber-writers are posting their work online with the hope that, like Murong's novels, their stories will be read by millions, ultimately becoming books or movies and turning the authors into celebrities. The online Chinese literary scene is, in some ways, like a TV reality show. Bookstores now have sections devoted to Internet novels published as paperbacks, while a number of other influential writers have emerged from the Web over the years, including Annie Baobei, whose books about love and loneliness in Chinese cities have sold more than a million copies. ""In America, people have the American dream. In China, people have the online dream,"" said Dai Yingniao, a college junior who says almost all of her friends read online fantasy novels about time travel, romance or some mixture of the two. These genres are mostly read by ordinary girls who find life boring, said Dai, noting her roommate especially fancies a novel from the Qidian Web site called ""The Legend of Little Beauty."" ""I prefer real literature rather than imaginary works,"" added the 20-year-old. She then described a cyber-novel she is planning to write about a princess who lives during the Qing Dynasty. After leaving her home in Beijing, the princess returns to find she no longer recognizes her family or the society she had lived in a few years before. ""I just want to convey my opinions about today's life,"" Dai said. ""Sometimes euphemism is more powerful."" Today it is more accepted for Chinese publishers to take risks with voices emerging online, many now printing stories that simply would not have been possible a decade ago. Publishing houses often peruse Web sites for talent whose writing can be brought to readers who are not logged on. ""Publishers can come in and say there are readers for this, and this is the demographic and if we want to hit young adults, then this is a great voice,"" said Jo Lusby, the manager of Penguin China. ""[The literary Web sites] are now a very natural part of the publishing scene in China. It is really a convergence of print and online writing."" Yet despite what has been a gradual commercialization and subsequent opening up of the Chinese publishing industry during the past few years, many of the writers who are able to self-publish with freedom online find they still can face substantial censorship when their works are adapted for offline audiences. ""Offline publishing is still tightly controlled and not easy to change,"" said Yang Hengjun, whose spy novels are banned in the country. ""Any Internet novel is largely edited when it goes to publishing."" In the long run, however, Yang said he believes the freedom of literary expression on the Internet will spur even further liberalization in the Chinese publishing industry. ""It is a good thing and it is a promising thing,"" said Yang. ""Nowadays for more and more people if they want to express themselves, they can go online.""","China now has the most Internet users in the world .

"(CNN) -- A suspended Roman Catholic priest pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal drug charge, the U.S. Attorney's Office for Connecticut announced. The Rev. Kevin Wallin, 61, of Waterbury, Connecticut, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute crystal methamphetamine. With the plea, he admitted that he received and distributed 1.7 kilograms of the drug, U.S. Attorney David B. Fein said in a statement. Wallin was arrested January 3 after an investigation that involved wiretaps, confidential sources and an undercover officer, Fein's announcement said. A search of Wallin's apartment found meth, drug paraphernalia and drug packaging materials, said Thomas Carson, Fein's spokesman. Wallin sold meth to the undercover officer six times between September and January, Fein said. According to an affidavit that accompanied his indictment in January, Wallin received shipments of meth from two people in California, Kristen Laschober and Chad McCluskey, with the understanding that Wallin would pay them with earnings generated by distributing the drug to his customers and other dealers. Wallin allegedly got Kenneth Devries, a neighbor in his apartment building, to receive packages and distribute the drug when he was unable to do it himself. Authorities said they believe Wallin also distributed the drug to alleged dealer Michael Nelson of Manchester. Laschober, McCluskey, Devries and Nelson were all arrested in January and are awaiting trial. Authorities are still investigating the possibility that others are involved, Carson said. Wallin faced a maximum term of life in prison and a fine of up to $10 million on seven counts, but his plea agreement calls for a prison sentence of 11 to 14 years. Judge Alfred Covello has scheduled sentencing for June 25 at the United States Court House in Hartford. CNN made several attempts to contact Fein, federal public defender Kelly Barrett and Diocese of Bridgeport spokesman Brian Wallace for comments, but calls were not returned.","The Rev.

"New York (CNN) -- A police officer accused of a cannibalism plot spent hours online with a man who was kicked off a fetish website because his fantasies were too dark and real, testimony Wednesday revealed. On the third day of Gilberto Valle's federal trial, prosecutors introduced e-mails and chats between Valle and a 35-year-old Pakistani man who re-registered on the website under the name ""Throat Slitter."" Valle, 28, is charged with conspiracy to kidnap a woman. The six-year New York Police Department veteran also is charged with accessing a federal database on at least one occasion, allegedly to get information on one of his alleged targets. Prosecutors argue Valle was ""deadly serious"" about online plans to allegedly kidnap, cook and eat women. None of Valle's alleged targets was ever victimized. Defense attorneys argue their client's conduct was fantasy role-playing. Prosecutors: NYPD officer was 'deadly serious' FBI agent Corey Walsh read electronic conversations that ran through most of 2012, until Valle's arrest in October. In them, Valle allegedly talks to his friend, a self-described butcher who used the online name ""Alisherkhan,"" about bringing a 25-year-old American woman to Rawalpindi or Lahore, where Alisherkhan promises, ""I will make a good meal for you."" The Pakistani man even says he will buy special knives for the occasion and asks Valle whether he will ""participate in the slaughter process with me?"" According to Walsh, Valle says, ""I would actually love to cook a girl alive over an open fire."" Then, referring to his wife, who discovered the fetish and alerted authorities, Valle says, ""I've had other girls I want to kill more..."" In May, Valle notifies his chat buddy he has picked out a girl, someone he has thought about for eight years. Alisherkhan prods Valle to ""send details from drugs to dismembering"" but then questions Valle's seriousness. The officer reassures him, saying he will cook the woman at 160 degrees and that ""she will absolutely suffer,"" according to testimony. In later conversations, the two men allegedly talk about plans for sexually assaulting the alleged target. Prosecutors say the conversations confirm their kidnapping conspiracy. Man accused of offering money to cop . During opening statements, Valle's lawyer, Julia L. Gatto, described the conversations as ""pure fiction,"" telling jurors, ""Gil is guilty of having bizarre thoughts and foolishly sharing them on an Internet with others ...There's no crime here, just very disturbing, shocking thoughts."" Valle, in one e-mail chat to another person, wrote, ""No matter what I say, it's make believe ... I just have a world in my mind and in that world I am kidnapping women and selling them to people interested in buying."" On cross-examination, agent Walsh acknowledged that contrary to his e-mail claims, Valle had no chloroform, ropes or large oven in which to cook his alleged targets. And while Valle had bragged of stuffing a woman in a suitcase and putting her in the back of his car, FBI agents never swabbed Valle's vehicle for DNA, nor did they conduct any surveillance during the one-month investigation, according to testimony. Criminal database records were introduced into evidence with the names of several of Valle's alleged targets. Defense attorneys pointed out that none of the names were listed with home or other addresses.

"(CNN) -- A flight labeled the ""final"" certification test of an improved battery system for the grounded Boeing 787 Dreamliner was ""straightforward"" and ""uneventful,"" the airplane maker said Friday. The test was an important one for Boeing, which has billions of dollars riding on the success of the new airliner. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and similar regulators worldwide grounded the Dreamliner in January after two battery-related fires damaged 787s in Boston and Japan. No one was hurt in the fires. In March the FAA approved a Boeing certification plan to fix the 787's problematic lithium-ion battery system and prove the new design is safe. Friday's nearly two-hour flight was the final certification test of that plan. Boeing announces changes to Dreamliner battery system . Boeing ""will now gather and analyze the data and submit the required materials to the FAA,"" the company said in a news release. It said it expects the material to be delivered in a matter of days. The flight left Paine Field in Everett, Washington, at 10:39 a.m. with a crew of 11, including two FAA representatives, Boeing said, and it returned at 12:28 p.m. ""The crew reported that the certification demonstration plan was straightforward and the flight was uneventful,"" Boeing's news release said. ""The purpose of the flight was to demonstrate that the new battery system performs as intended during normal and non-normal flight conditions."" At the time the planes were grounded, 50 787s were flying worldwide.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- If 2011 was the year that South by Southwest Interactive grew up, 2012 may be when it decides it wants to don a suit and enter the corporate world -- or run off and join the Peace Corps. The history of the funky, Austin-based festival suggests it may try to do both. Since its start as the multimedia portion of the SXSW Film Festival in 1994, the event -- which runs Friday through Tuesday -- has its roots in community-driven tech creativity. But in the last five years, the festival has grown bigger and more commercial. Riding the explosion of interest in social-media services and mobile technology, the fest has a reputation for hosting some of the biggest names in tech and helping launch some influential start-ups. In 2007, a tiny service nobody had heard of called Twitter used the fest as a launching ground, installing big screens around the Austin Convention Center with a stream of short messages on display called ""tweets."" In 2008, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was a disastrous keynote guest for a Q&A that was derailed by a disgruntled audience unhappy with interviewer Sarah Lacy's softball questions. Both events were turning points for SXSW Interactive -- known to festival veterans as ""South By"" -- which at the time was still recovering from some lean years after the dot-com bust. Twitter's ascension meant many more start-ups began trying to use the festival, which is filled with influential early adopters, as a launching pad for their products. And the Zuckerberg keynote was notable for the attention it brought to SXSWi as a place where crazy, unpredictable things can happen. Huge growth . Over the last two years, the mix of hungry entrepreneurs, social-media mavens and SXSW's traditional attendees -- techies, designers and those interested in the societal impact of technology -- have shared an uneasy peace as SXSW Interactive has exploded in popularity. From 2009 to 2010, SXSW Interactive's attendance jumped from nearly 11,000 to just under 15,000. Last year, the fest saw another spike, to nearly 20,000 attendees. The festival says it doesn't expect a growth rate of 30-40% for 2012 as in previous years. But based on pre-registration numbers, attendance will likely increase again over last year. All those extra bodies stuffing panel rooms and downtown parties at the festival have marked a shift in the culture of South by Southwest, and prompted a lot of soul searching by festival organizers. They're tasked with deciding what the future of Interactive will be in the face of more people, more programming and more interest in what is the festival's hot new tech. Hugh Forrest, the SXSW Interactive director who has headed up the fest since it began, acknowledges that he and his staff are working hard to balance what he calls ""start-up mania"" with more community-focused parts of the event. ""Start-ups are hot. For better or for worse, we've been lucky enough to become a center for a lot of that stuff. It's one of the things that South By is built on and that's good,"" Forrest said. ""One of the tensions we faced this year is we've got lots and lots of the start-up stuff and that's very exciting, but at the same time, it's not completely what we're about."" Business vs. community good . The tension between what's good for the online world (and the world at large) and what products can make money is at the heart of a lot of the festival's official programming. Some people increasingly see SXSWi as a place where fledgling start-ups go to strike it rich. There's a ""Start-up Village"" area, an ""American Idol""-styled start-up competition called ""Accelerator,"" and lots of panels, parties and expo floor space devoted to them. But the start-ups remain counter-balanced by less business oriented parts of the festival. And there's still an emphasis on socially conscious creativity. The keynote speakers this year include humorist Baratunde Thurston, ""cyber anthropologist"" Amber Case, Code for America founder Jennifer Pahlka and futurist Ray Kurzweil. High-profile CEOs like Zuckerberg, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh or Twitter co-founder Evan Williams -- all past keynote speakers -- are nowhere to be found on this year's roster. For the first time, the festival will give out a Hall of Fame award at its Interactive Awards ceremony. Web pioneer Jeffrey Zellman is the first inductee. SXSWi also has expanded its Dewey Winburne Community Service Award to include national and international winners, instead of just local recipients. Last year Interactive got attention for a community effort that was completely unplanned and that didn't spring from the fest itself: After earthquakes and tsunamis devastated Japan on the opening day of the festival, attendees launched ""SXSW4Japan,"" which raised funds for relief efforts. The 2011 festival also attracted the attention of Apple, which opened a pop-up store in downtown Austin to accommodate crowds clamoring for its just-launched iPad 2. (Apple says it has no such plans this year.) 2012's slate . SXSW is big enough now to encompass almost every conceivable tech perspective. With more than 2,600 speakers and hundreds of topics, there's plenty of room for discussion about everything from the future of health care and the increasing role of technology in government change to good app design and the role of social media in Occupy Wall Street-style protests. Celebrity panelists like TV foodie Anthony Bourdain, media titan Barry Diller, filmmaker Joss Whedon, filmmaker and comic-book geek Kevin Smith, actor Rainn Wilson and ""Top Chef"" star Tom Colicchio will share the bill with lesser-known web designers, bloggers and founders of tiny companies who made a new app they swear you just have to try. This week also will find Dave Morin of Path talking about ""why happiness is the new currency,"" Gawker's Nick Denton weighing in on the failure of online comments and a panel of Web producers pondering the question, ""Is aggregation theft?"" Like most events with growing pains, SXSWi is full of contradictions. It's trying very hard to be both sprawling and intimate, continually plugged-in but also right there in person. It's a cutting-edge gathering that hates pretension. It's a mash of bodies with their heads in the Cloud, all looking to be dazzled by some new digital jewel. Like any ambitious 19-year-old, SXSW Interactive is restless, driven and hard to pigeonhole. The festival may be unsure where it will end up, but it's convinced it knows how to get there.","SXSW Interactive evolves from small, community-driven event into a huge industry happening .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government reports a 9% increase in motor vehicle traffic fatalities for the first half of 2012, the largest jump during the first six months of any previous year since data was first collected in 1975. A statistical projection from January through June estimates 16,290 people died in vehicular crashes this year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The previous highest increase during the first half of the year was 6.4% in 1979. In releasing the report, the administration said, ""While it is too soon to speculate on the contributing factors or potential implications of any increase on our roadways, it should be noted that the historic downward trend in traffic fatalities in the past several years... means any comparison will be to an unprecedented low baseline figure."" The government pointed out fatalities during the first half of the year have declined by about 27% from the recent high in 2006 (20,500 fatalities) to the first half of 2011 (14,950 fatalities.) The American Automobile Association called this year's numbers ""alarming."" ""This news is very disturbing,"" Lon Anderson, spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic, said in a statement. ""We have worked decades to reduce fatalities in America... but this is a serious shot across the bow, a warning that as we drive more, our roads may not be as safe as we thought they were."" Anderson cites an improved economy with more cars, trucks and traffic on the roads as one explanation for the rise. ""Another likely contributing factor to these fatalities is the continued deterioration of highways and deferral of needed maintenance and improvements by federal and state governments,"" he said. Data from the Federal Highway Administration showed vehicle miles traveled in the first six months of 2012 increased by 15.6 billion miles, a 1.1% increase from 2011.","Spike is the highest since record keeping began in 1975 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- To this day, Linda Haywood recalls the shame she once felt for her great-uncle. Jack Johnson was convicted of transporting a white woman across state lines for ""immoral purposes."" ""I could see from the expression on my mother's face that it pained her to tell me about him,"" she recalled, ""but it wasn't just her. The shame was there for all the members of my family."" Haywood's great-uncle, Jack Johnson, shocked the nation in 1908 by becoming the first African-American world heavyweight champion. Yet the boxer was arrested not long afterward for taking a white woman across state lines for ""immoral"" purposes. That case fell apart and the woman later became his wife, but then investigators charged him with a similar offense involving a woman he had dated years earlier. An all-white jury's decision to convict him in that case has come to be widely viewed as a symbol of racial injustice. Now Haywood is working with Sen. John McCain and others to try to clear her great-uncle's name. McCain wants the Senate to pass a resolution urging President Obama to grant Johnson a presidential pardon. It would represent a final vindication for Haywood, a 53-year-old seamstress in Chicago who now views her great-uncle with pride. Her parents didn't tell her until she was 12 that she was related to Johnson, even though she saw his photo at school during lessons on black history. ""I remember seeing his picture on the wall of my sixth-grade classroom in Chicago in 1966,"" Haywood said in a voice tinged with sadness. ""It was up there next to pictures of Sojourner Truth and George Washington Carver as part of a black history week my teacher put together. I didn't have the first clue who the man was. My parents didn't want me to know."" Her parents, she said, were trying to protect her from a legacy of racial injustice at a time when the country had yet to emerge from the long shadow of segregation. Haywood was stunned when she learned her great-uncle's story. Less than five years after winning the heavyweight title, Johnson was convicted for violating the Mann Act, which outlawed the transportation of women across state lines for ""immoral"" purposes. Johnson was black and the woman was white -- enough to get even a champion imprisoned in early 20th century America. Justice Department lawyers decried it as a ""crime against nature"" for him to have a sexual relationship with a white woman. Judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis, later to become the first commissioner of Major League Baseball, set Johnson's bail at $30,000 -- the equivalent of more than $660,000 today. When a bail bondsman showed up, Landis jailed him, too, according to an account that filmmaker Ken Burns relays in his documentary, ""Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson."" An all-white jury convicted Johnson in less than two hours. ""Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but ... it was his misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the intermarriage of whites and blacks,"" one of the prosecutors later said. Johnson's real crime, in the eyes of many, was committed three years earlier, when he successfully defended his boxing title against Jim Jeffries, a white boxer who came to be called the ""Great White Hope"" because many white fans saw him as the best chance to wrest back a boxing title from the African-American champ. Jeffries, a former heavyweight champion, had come out of retirement intending to reclaim a title that many Americans believed Johnson had no right to in the first place. Johnson beat Jeffries on July 4, 1910, before a stunned, almost entirely white crowd in Reno, Nevada. Race riots followed. More than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Most victims were black. So when they ""couldn't beat him in the ring, the white power establishment decided to beat him in the courts,"" Burns said in his documentary. Johnson fled to Europe in 1913 while free on appeal. But after years of fights overseas -- including the eventual loss of his title in Havana, Cuba, in 1915 -- Johnson came home. He turned himself over to U.S. authorities at the Mexican border in 1920 and served ten months in prison. He died in a car wreck in 1946. ""Back then, if you were black and you were told that you did something wrong, you really had no recourse,"" said Haywood. ""You just accepted what was done because black people were basically powerless and voiceless. Jack may have been a rich boxer, but he couldn't fight the system."" Today, in a very different America, Haywood's family is seeking justice. They've teamed up with Burns, McCain and Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, to urge the nation's first African-American president to grant Johnson a rare posthumous pardon. McCain and King introduced resolutions calling for a presidential pardon in 2005 and last year. The House passed it, but the Senate did not. The White House declined to comment when asked Obama's views on a possible pardon for Johnson. McCain, who says he made a mistake by once voting against a federal holiday for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., sees the pardon as a way to right an old wrong. ""The Jack Johnson case is an ignominious stain on our nation's history,"" he said on the Senate floor this month, while introducing a new version of the resolution. ""Rectifying this injustice is long overdue. [The resolution recognizes] the unjustness of what transpired, and sheds light on the achievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice. Johnson ... deserved much better than a racially motivated conviction."" King, himself a former boxer, said in a written statement that Johnson was a trailblazer who became ""a victim of the times."" For Haywood, the proposed pardon is also personal. It's about wiping the slate clean for future generations of her family. ""My mother used to say Jack was defiant,"" she remembered. ""No disrespect, momma, but he was being his own man. And I'm so proud of him. To think -- of all the families in the world, God gave him to us."" Haywood has made sure her four children know the story of the country's first black heavyweight champion. ""They love him,"" she said. ""Especially my oldest son. He was a bit of a pugilist in high school. He got into his fair share of scraps. I think we know where he got that trait."" Haywood says she'll go to Washington if Obama issues a pardon. With a bit of laughter, she promises to give a gracious, eloquent speech thanking him. With or without a pardon, she emphasizes, the stigma and the shame are gone. Today, Johnson's family feels only pride.","Heavyweight champ Jack Johnson was arrested around 1908 .

"(CNN) -- Some athletes respond to a proverbial kick up the backside, but Rory McIlroy seems to have found inspiration from the prick of a cactus thorn. The Northern Irishman canceled a humanitarian trip to Haiti to play in this week's Texas Open, hoping to rediscover his form ahead of next week's Masters. The two-time major winner added San Antonio to his Augusta buildup after registering just one top-10 finish since signing a lucrative deal with Nike in January which could be worth as much as $250 million, and losing the top ranking to Tiger Woods. While Thursday's first-round 72 left him five strokes off the lead, McIlroy roared back with a five-under-par 67 that left him two off the halfway pace. The world No. 2 had a mixed opening few holes, and he dropped his second shot of Friday's second round following a close encounter with a flower of the desert on the ninth fairway. ""I shouldn't have been there anyways, so I guess it was deserved, getting a -- whatever it was -- off the cactus,"" McIlroy said on the PGA Tour website. The 23-year-old responded with a birdie at 11, and three more at the last three holes to end the day tied for fifth and in sight of pacesetter Billy Horschel. ""I definitely feel like I made the right decision to come here, and even if I hadn't been in this position and have been a few shots back I'd still feel the same way,"" McIlroy said. ""I haven't really been in contention this year. So it will be nice to get into the mix."" While his shotmaking has been erratic at times, McIlroy's long game is in fine shape. He managed to get to the green in two at the par-five eighth and 18th -- the latter after a 325-yard tee shot -- though he missed eagle putts at both. ""I think that shows where my game is,"" McIlroy said. ""Those two par-fives are probably the toughest to hit in two with how small the greens are. It shows that my ball-striking is there. If I can keep hitting shots like that into par-fives, I'll be doing OK."" McIlroy tied for 45th at last week's Houston Open, where Horschel was joint second behind D.A. Points. The American closed with two birdies to sign for a 68 and take a handy lead over compatriots Daniel Summerhays (69) and Charley Hoffman (67) as well as Australia's Steven Bowditch (69). Two-time major winner John Daly missed the halfway cut by one shot after following up his 76 with 70, finishing birdie-bogey-birdie.","Rory McIlroy's form improves after an encounter with a cactus at the Texas Open .

"(CNN) -- Two Catholic priests accused of wrongdoing have been declared unfit for service by the Philadelphia archdiocese and will no longer be allowed to minister. Joseph J. Gallagher, 78, and Mark S. Gaspar, 43, are two of the 26 priests who were suspended by the archdiocese after a 2011 grand jury investigation into the archdiocese's handling of child sex abuse allegations. They were placed on administrative leave while the church looked into allegations of abuse and misconduct. Archbishop Charles J. Chaput said the investigations of Gallagher and Gaspar found substantiated violations of the ""Standards of Ministerial Behavior and Boundaries,"" an archdiocese guide for behavior, including interaction with children and youths. The violations were not explained. ""After reviewing all the facts, as well as recommendations from competent external authorities, I made the decisions I feel are right and just,"" Chaput said in a statement released Sunday. Gallagher retired in 2006 from the Church of St. Richard of Chichester in Philadelphia. Gaspar was a priest at Our Lady of Charity Church in Brookhaven, Pennsylvania, when he was suspended in 2011. There has been no public response from either man. They will have the right to appeal to the Vatican. Gallagher is the priest at the center of a wrongful-death suit filed against the archdiocese by the family of Daniel Neill, who killed himself in 2009 after his allegations were deemed not credible by church officials. According to the 2007 grand jury report, Neill reported that Gallagher repeatedly fondled him when he was a minor and served as an altar boy in Bristol, Pennsylvania. ""This is too little too late to help our clients whose son committed suicide, having been abused by Gallagher,"" said attorney Marci Hamilton, who represents the Neill family. ""But it is good news for parents who can at least now know that Gallagher and Gaspar should not be near children."" Of the 26 priests who were suspended in 2011, nine have been found unsuitable for the ministry and eight have been found suitable. One priest has been arrested and one died before a full investigation could be conducted. Seven cases are still outstanding. With nearly 1.5 million members, the Philadelphia archdiocese is one of the largest in the nation. Philly priest gets 3 to 6 years in abuse case .

"(CNN) -- As Spain struggles with its economic problems, business owners such as Manuel Rodriguez are hoping the country's new conservative government will push through pre-election promises for corporate tax breaks and cutting red tape. Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy won last month's election after telling voters the economy was his priority. Manuel Rodriguez, who heads a century-old family business, Guitarras Manuel Rodriguez and Sons, says he hopes the new leader is aggressive in implementing economic reforms. ""We need very drastic changes in Europe,"" Rodriguez says. His business, which manufactures Spanish classical guitars, has survived Spain's recent economic pain while other competitors have had to close. Rodriguez believes his chances of surviving the tough climate are being dented by the country's high business taxes and rigid labor laws. His company has a joint venture in China to make lower-priced guitars -- a deal which has helped increase sales globally by 10% this year. However, his experience within the country leads him to ask: ""How can you compete with people in China working 60 hours a week and we are working 37 hours?"" The business retains its premium guitars production in Spain, but now with fewer workers. In just a few years the workforce has dropped from 60 staff to 25. Guitarras Manuel Rodriguez and Sons has not hired a new full-time employee in six years. Rodriguez wants to hire again -- Spain has 21.5% unemployment, with 45% among youth -- but says the country's corporate regulations need to be overhauled to enable this. ""We need more freedom, [the regulations are] too tight,"" says Rodriguez. CNN's Emily Smith contributed to this story.","Spanish business owners hope the new government will push through corporate tax breaks and cut red tape .

"(CNN) -- Illegal sales practices by CVS Pharmacy Inc. allowed criminals to make mass purchases of a component used in the manufacturer of methamphetamine, said federal prosecutors, who announced a settlement Thursday that will cost the company $77.6 million and bring new controls. The company's improper sales of pseudoephedrine, an ingredient found in cold and sinus medicines, led directly to an increase in methamphetamine production in California, said the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, California. CVS is the biggest operator of retail pharmacies in the United States. As part of the agreement, CVS -- which blamed the sales on ""the flawed implementation of an electronic monitoring system"" --  has agreed to pay $75 million in civil penalties and to forfeit the $2.6 million in profits the company earned from the sales, prosecutors said in a news release. ""This case shows what happens when companies fail to follow their ethical and legal responsibilities,"" said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. ""CVS knew it had a duty to prevent methamphetamine trafficking, but it failed to take steps to control the sale of a regulated drug used by methamphetamine cooks as an essential ingredient for their poisonous stew."" The company will not face criminal charges; instead it will implement a compliance and ethics program over the next three years, prosecutors said. CVS changed its sales practices only after it became aware of the government's investigation, officials said. Authorities found thousands of violations of a 2005 act which, among other things, limits the amount of pseudoephedrine a customer can purchase in a single day. Prosecutors said the violations occurred in California, Nevada  and ""likely"" 23 other states where ""CVS failed to implement appropriate safeguards."" In 2007, after Mexico banned the sale of pseudoephedrine, Los Angeles County experienced an epidemic of ""smurfing"", a practice in which individuals make multiple purchases of items containing pseudoephedrine with the aim of getting large amounts for use in meth production, the statement said. CVS, unlike other retailers, failed to prevent the practice, prosecutors allege. ""Smurfers inundated CVS stores in Los Angeles and Orange County, and later stores in the Las Vegas [Nevada] area, to purchase cough and cold remedies, sometimes cleaning out store shelves,"" authorities said. CVS pledged to prevent such sales in the future. ""While this lapse occurred in 2007 and 2008 and has been addressed, it was an unacceptable breach of the company's policies and was totally inconsistent with our values,"" said Thomas M. Ryan, chairman and CEO of  CVS Caremark. ""CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its support of the measures taken by the federal government and the states to prevent drug abuse."" CVS has strengthened internal controls and compliance measures, Ryan said in a written statement.","NEW: Company says it will institute new controls .

"(CNN) -- Merle Haggard is celebrating his 75th birthday Friday. After he blows out the candles on his cake, he'll climb aboard his tour bus to begin a cross-country journey from Northern California to Nashville, where he'll headline a show Wednesday at the Ryman Auditorium. It's the perfect venue to showcase the country music icon's latest album, ""Working in Tennessee."" Released last fall, the disc is chock-full of new songs written by Haggard, with a little help from his wife, Theresa, and daughter Jenessa. Son Ben plays guitar and joins his dad and family friend Willie Nelson for a remake of Haggard's 1969 classic, ""Working Man Blues."" Two more children -- ""from the first litter,"" as the entertainer puts it -- are part of Haggard's road crew. While most 75-year-olds are retired or cutting back on their schedules, the Country Music Hall of Famer shows no signs of slowing down despite hospitalizations in January for double pneumonia, three stomach ulcers, eight polyps in his colon and diverticulitis in his esophagus. In 2008, he beat lung cancer. Haggard calls himself a walking miracle and credits God for keeping him healthy. He spent his 21st birthday in San Quentin State Prison for attempted robbery. He'll celebrate this birthday surrounded by family and friends at his home in Palo Cedro, California. For the remainder of April, he'll travel around the country, playing new songs and old such hits like ""Mama Tried"" and ""Okie From Muskogee."" In a rare and unflinching interview with CNN, the man critics have dubbed ""Poet of the Common Man"" sounds off on religion, poverty, politics, health and family. ""The thing I hope I have in common with the people out there is honesty,"" he says. ""I am not going to lie to the public or to anybody else. I got a pact with myself on that."" CNN: Can we talk about your album ""Working in Tennessee""? Merle Haggard: I'm excited about it. There is a lot of interest. And I'm out here trying to promote it. CNN: You don't give many interviews. Haggard: Well, they're worth more when you do 'em. CNN: The album is kind of a family affair. Haggard: It is. Theresa (his wife of 18 years) is involved, and both of the younger children. Benny (19) is playing guitar throughout the album. The family aspect adds some appeal to it. CNN: Ben can sure play the guitar for someone so young. Haggard: His mother knew more about it earlier than I did. She kept telling me that he could play if I would listen. One day he showed up and he knew how to play. I never watched him learn. He plays like an adult. Professional. He's on thunder. CNN: Is he very much like you? Haggard: He is much wiser than his father. CNN: You were raising some hell when you were his age. Haggard: Yeah. He hopefully won't have to do that. He has left that up to his father, I think. He has really got some words of wisdom every time you listen to him. He's a fantastic boy. CNN: There's a song on this album that keeps sticking with me called ""What I Hate."" Haggard: There's a lot of things I hate. It gave me a chance to vent what irritates me and also to turn around and say what I love. It is an interesting song. I like it best of all on the album. CNN: Tell us the first couple of lines. Haggard: (Sings) ""What I hate is a statesman speaking out of both sides of his mouth."" That's the first line. CNN: Do you think there's a lot of that going on? Haggard: Well, going into this election year, I would bet on it. (Laughs) CNN: Have you been keeping track of what's been going on in the presidential race? Haggard: I think an ex-convict has got a real good chance. I probably oughta run! At least all of my past is aboveboard, and they won't have to spend a lot of money to run a make on me! I think Obama will probably win the next race. CNN: (President Barack) Obama has certainly had his share of challenges in his administration. How do you think he's done so far? Haggard: I don't think it makes much difference who the president is. I think there was a big ball rolling before he came into the picture. He kind of did what I do. I didn't do anything. He hasn't done anything that I can see that's made any real difference. I think he is a fine gentleman, and they treated us real well when we were up there at the Kennedy Center (Haggard was a Kennedy Center honoree in 2010), and I am not going to badmouth him. I think he has the next four years wrapped up. He has done some good. He got Osama bin Laden. That is a real big plus. Now on the home front, it is kind of fiddling while Rome burns. We are in trouble economically. I don't think we can blame it all on one black man. I think we spent 50 years getting ourselves in trouble, and it may take a long time to get ourselves out of it. It is going to take more years than I got left. CNN: Why do you think things have gotten so contentious? Haggard: When we left the gold standard, when we left the silver standard, when we started issuing notes and papers and trying to give everybody everything. America has had a helping hand in every part of the world. I think they are bringing those troops home because they can't afford it. Look at Germany. They've had no army to support. Who are all the Europeans going to borrow this money from? They're going to Germany. CNN: You've lived through some tough times. Your family made a home out of a boxcar, and your dad passed away when you were 9. Haggard: My father was a creative human being. He didn't have much formal education, but he was able to do things with his hands. He built everything inside of that boxcar and made a home out of it. Built a cement step out front and a walkway out to the driveway. It looked just like a regular home. CNN: Did you think you were a poor child growing up? Haggard: No. I was very well taken care of. We were poor, and when I could realize, I could see how poor we were. We lived paycheck to paycheck, and dad worked for the Santa Fe Railroad. I think he made in excess of 45 cents an hour. Just barely. And he got 10 hours a day. I remember him coming home one day and saying they were going to cut the hours down to nine hours a day, and they were going to pay us the same money. That won't work. That was the beginning of the big union influence in America. CNN: When you hit success, what did that mean to you? Haggard: I am smart enough to know that I have been gifted and have had a better than average shot at everything. I have been blessed many times. I walk a blessed man's path. I believe in the heavenly Father, and if he is not there, then there is somebody disguising himself and answering my prayers. I am a deeply religious man, and I believe that if you give it half a shot, that he will help you. And he certainly has me. CNN: What are you praying for these days? Haggard: Peace, harmony, health and the family. I pray for the children, and I pray over the food we eat. You know, our food's been contaminated. It's hard to find good water. We pray over that. And we say a prayer every now and then when we're fixing to make a record. You probably wouldn't call us religious people if you saw us with a camera. You might not see what we're doing. Sometimes there is a prayer being mumbled under our breath. That is the way it is if someone had a reality show on us. Might be interesting. CNN: Is it a good time in your life? Haggard: I am real fortunate. I am going to be 75, and I am able to walk around. I ain't got no artificial hips. I got a bunch of false teeth in my mouth. But considering all where I have been with everything, and what I have been through, I am in real good condition. CNN: What are you going to do for your 75th birthday? Haggard: Take a big breath! (Laughs) What's it going to be like for the next three-quarters of a century? It'd be our luck they may extend the lifespan for another 150 years, you know.","Critics have dubbed Merle Haggard the ""Poet of the Common Man""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- In one spot, a moderate Republican congressman is portrayed as a demon sheep -- a threat to the Republican flock. In another ad, a candidate for governor declares to viewers, ""I'm one tough nerd!"" And, of course, there's the now-infamous ""I am not a witch"" spot. These are among the most talked-about campaign commercials and videos of this political season. And they're all brought to you by Republican producer Fred Davis. His secret to a winning ad? ""To me, it has to stand out. And you have to talk about it,"" an excited Davis said. ""It has to be different."" Standing out seems to be a way of life for the ad man. Take his office: It's a three-story house in the Hollywood Hills, where he is surrounded by Los Angeles liberals. His place is filled with odd artifacts, including a two-headed calf perched next to a trove of awards. Davis did Sen. John McCain's media work in the 2008 campaign, which included the Republican National Convention. Connect the dots, and, yes, he helped introduce Sarah Palin to the nation. This year, he helped McCain pull through a hard-fought primary with a commercial that featured the candidate walking along the U.S.-Mexican border, telling a sheriff it's time to ""build the danged fence."" Davis also produced the memorable Ben Quayle spot in which the former vice president's baby-faced son -- who is running for Congress in Arizona -- looked into the camera and declared, ""Barack Obama is the worst president in history."" But the ad that will probably be talked about for years to come is the first spot for Delaware senatorial candidate Christine O'Donnell. The relative unknown hadn't aired a single commercial and was being parodied on late-night TV for saying, years ago, that she dabbled in witchcraft. Davis decided that rather than ignore the controversy, O'Donnell should take on the comics and critics directly. In her first commercial out of the gate, O'Donnell announced to viewers, ""I am not a witch. I am you."" ""My goal was to give people the same impression of Christine O'Donnell that I had the first second that I met her,"" Davis said. ""She didn't sound crazy. She didn't sound like a witch. She didn't sound like any of those things, and I wanted the rest of the world to hear that as well."" The commercial itself was parodied on late-night television. O'Donnell recently said she regretted revisiting the issue because it renewed the controversy. Though these days, critics are no longer calling O'Donnell a witch. Davis does not shy away from controversy. He thinks he'll be best known for a video that went viral after it aired during the California Republican convention. The video, for GOP senatorial candidate Carly Fiorina, featured her Republican opponent -- a moderate -- as a wolf dressed as a sheep, with devilish, glowing red eyes. Playing to primary voters' desire for ideological purity, the spot declared Tom Campbell a RINO: Republican in Name Only. Campbell lost that primary. ""Demon sheep. You wouldn't be here if it weren't for the demon sheep. I am quite certain. Demon sheep was a nothing. I never in a million years would have guessed it would [have] happened,"" Davis recounted. He says he got the idea when Fiorina's campaign manager said he wanted to convince voters that Tom Campbell wasn't the fiscal expert he claimed to be. Davis recalled, ""I'm thinking sheep. And I'm thinking, what is it? Wolf in sheep's clothing! And one thing led to another, and it was a very cheap little video. I didn't think five people would ever see it. And millions have seen it, and the rest of my life I will be introduced as the demon sheep guy."" Like many of his ideas, he says, that one just came to him. He adds that often, his best ideas come in the middle of the night. ""I sleep with a legal pad every night. I am very exciting,"" he deadpanned. Davis, who also makes non-political ads, is not getting much sleep in the final days of the campaigns. His relatively small company of about a dozen full-time staff has offices in Los Angeles; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Washington. He is working simultaneously this cycle for about eight campaigns and is helping on others through the Republican Governors Association and a couple of third-party groups. Davis strives to make a personal connection between the candidate and the audience. ""You know what I try to do? I try to really like my clients. And if I really like them, I try to think. You mentioned Carly [Fiorina]. What is it I like about Carly? Well, she's fun, she's positive, she's up, she's chipper, and so I try to impart those feelings about her,"" he said. ""The pieces I like, I figured, if I come to like them, I can help somebody else find those same characteristics, and maybe they'll like them too. So it's not always 100 percent issue-based."" He knows his work doesn't sit well with all viewers. ""I get criticized every day of my life for something,"" he said with a laugh. Does he ever worry that his work goes too far outside the box? ""That does cross my mind. Most people must think that it does not. And that I'll do anything to get attention."" In his analysis, America is generally divided into two halves, or boxes: the Republican half and the ""dim half."" ""If you do something really well for this box, this box is going to hate it. If you do something really well for this box, this box is going to hate it,"" he summarized. ""So I expect, anticipate and enjoy and look forward to enormous criticism over something like demon sheep, because that helps me know that it's probably doing its job with this box where I am trying to do it. If I do something and the wrong box is energized, then that's a problem. And I have to fix it."" But that hasn't happened yet. ""No, not yet. Maybe today.""","Fred Davis has produced some of Republicans' most memorable TV spots .

"(CNN) -- Kenya's most critical and complex election in its 50th year since independence kicks off on March 4, next Monday. Critical because it'll be the first real road test of the new Western-style liberal constitution promulgated in August 2010 in the aftermath of Kenya's near-death experience after the controversial 2007 elections that resulted in a convulsion of violence that saw over 1,000 killed and at one point over 600,000 displaced. Critical as well because, crucially, two of the leading contenders, Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto of the Jubilee Coalition are defendants before the International Criminal Court (ICC) accused of crimes against humanity. They deny the charges, and will both run in the election. Rather unfortunately, an election many had hoped would be about the new constitution and resolving the underlying issues that made the last election so toxic, has ended up, thus far, defined by the ICC and the tribal mobilization this has enabled. Read this: Can mobiles help stop Kenya election violence? It is a complex election as well because Kenya is implementing a devolved 47-county system of government via these polls -- electing governors, senators, county representatives and other officials to a brand new federated structure of government -- an election that will be, per capita, the most expensive in the world. Still, Kenyans -- especially the rural poor -- are enthusiastic about devolution as it promises greater accountability on the part of one of the continent's most durable, sophisticated, well resourced, corrupt and ruthless elites. While much attention has focused on the close and potentially troublesome presidential election the real action may actually turn out to be at the county level that is totally new. Kenyans are coming to terms with the fact that what ""normal"" means is about to change forever. All these factors, combined with reports of continuing ethnic balkanization in informal settlements, threats and arming for both defensive and offensive violence, have served to create an atmosphere of high anxiety preceding the polls. The anxiety is in part because the country is trying to move so many big governance boulders at the same time informed by the violence that took place last time. Peace-building activities (prayers, concerts, roadshows, talk shows, plays, films etc.) have been legion, competing for overloaded national political bandwidth during this hectic electioneering period. It all reveals a country that terrified itself out of its own wits as a result of the sheer barbarity and speed of the meltdown in 2008. Read this: Kenyan DJs go without food for peaceful elections . That said, barring some catastrophic blunder by the nascent Independent Election and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) that shall be conducting the election, which pollsters predict will be so close between the two leading candidates, Kenyatta and Odinga that a run-off is likely, Kenyan elections are usually smooth affairs. Trouble usually comes afterwards. A second round is an innovation to Kenyans and much will transpire between the first and second rounds if there isn't a clear winner on March 4. The ICC has destabilized Kenya's politics but introduced a new measure of elite accountability, raising the cost of elite-driven violence to a level that has meant the tribal vitriol of previous electioneering hasn't been in such evidence this time around. Going by remarks of the ICC's president, the Kenyan case has clearly challenged the ICC too. Indeed, the future of the institution as a credible agent of change on the continent is dependent on how the Kenyan process plays out. However, regardless of the outcome, it is likely that a sizeable chunk of the Kenyan population will vote for ICC indictees with all the implications that has for the rule of law, Kenya's posture with regard to international standards of human rights and good governance, and for the country's standing within the African continent and global community. It will also hopefully lead to a good dose of national introspection. Indeed, it seemed to dawn on the business community and middle class (roughly 10% of the 14.3 million registered voters) only in the past month the terrible implications of ""getting this one wrong."" At a time when there has been considerable excitement about Africa's economic prospects, underpinned by deepening democratic culture in places like Ghana and Kenya, if Kenya falters in this transition it is not unlikely that the implications will be a review of the African renaissance that has at times caused excessive hyperventilating by hedge fund managers in the West as the world's latest ""emerging market"" emerges. What's clear, however, is that for Kenya the emergence will be bumpy and even bloody at times. But emerge it shall. According to the U.N. OCHA, between January last year and the start of this year, for example, almost 500 Kenyans (including dozens of police) have been killed in a worrying trend of the normalization of violence, and 112,000 citizens have been displaced. Read this: Can tech revolutionize African elections? Lots of unfinished business lingers from the last convulsion of violence and underlies it. Tribalism, historical grievances with regard to land, corruption, drug trafficking, money laundering and impunity among the elite in general have served to hold back the most globalized, diverse, industrious, economically innovative and dynamic country on the eastern side of the African continent. But most Kenyans, if not all their leaders, have a great will to make a success out of a transition that will lay the foundation for a stable, peaceful and prosperous future for the next generations. The need for a peaceful transition is particularly powerful in the collective imagination. There is an understanding that change won't come overnight, however, for while the new constitution has changed the forest, as a local saying goes, the monkeys have remained the same. All the leading presidential contenders are part of the old elite. That said, the constitution includes a raft of institutions and checks and balances that are also unprecedented. Secondly, Kenya has never had a younger, healthier, better educated, more globally connected and tech-savvy population in its entire history -- 75% of Kenyans are below 30 years of age. Indeed, there are five million first-time voters between the ages of 18 and 25. Kenyans are acutely aware that the conduct of the upcoming polls and the implementation of the new constitution, our handling of the ICC cases, will impact not only our future but the way Africa, and the world, views Africa. Honor means we have to get it right, despite the apparent odds. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of John Githongo.","John Githongo: Kenya is holding its most complex election since independence .

"(CNN) -- The secretary of Health and Human Services overruled Wednesday a Food and Drug Administration recommendation that would have made the emergency contraceptive pill Plan B One-Step available over the counter to girls younger than 17. In February, Teva Woman's Health Inc, the drug maker, had asked the FDA to make the drug available without prescription to all sexually active girls and women. At the time, FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said that, after reviewing all relevant data, ""Plan B One Step is safe and effective and should be approved for non-prescription use for all females of child-bearing potential."" But HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius overruled that recommendation. ""Because I do not believe enough data were presented to support the application ... I have directed FDA to issue a complete response letter denying the supplemental new drug application,"" she said in a statement. In July 2009, Plan B was approved for use without a prescription for females aged 17 and older, but girls under 17 needed a prescription. Emergency contraceptives prevent a pregnancy by preventing a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. They are intended for use within 72 hours after sex, but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. Proponents say requiring a prescription can delay access to the drug. Wednesday's decision was criticized by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which counts more than 8,000 members. ""We are very disappointed that Secretary Sebelius opted to insert herself into what should be a scientific decision made by the experts at FDA,"" said the group's president, Dolores J. Lamb. ""The data are clear that emergency contraception can be safely used by adolescent women without requiring a prescription. Sadly, it appears that once again our leaders are putting political expediency ahead of reproductive health."" But Dr. Lisa Flowers, associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Emory University's School of Medicine, said Sebelius' decision ""might be the right thing to do until we get a really good system by which we can educate young kids about prevention of pregnancy and understanding the risks of getting involved in sexual intercourse, and what are the outcomes."" Flowers suggested the FDA consider allowing over-the-counter access for girls under the age of 17 if they are accompanied by a parent to the drugstore.","NEW: ""We are very disappointed,"" says the head of a reproductive medicine group .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York nanny who allegedly stabbed to death two children in her care has been ruled emotionally fit to stand trial, prosecutors said on Friday.

They were found by their mother fatally stabbed in the bathroom of their Upper West Side apartment. Ortega has pleaded not guilty. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro said at a hearing on Friday that two psychiatrists had interviewed Ortega and determined she was capable of participating in her defense, according to a spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Ortega's attorney, Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg, plans to contest the findings, the spokesman said. Calls to Leer-Greenberg were not immediately returned to CNN. Ortega appeared at the proceeding but did not speak. A Spanish interpreter was provided for her. A native of the Dominican Republic, Ortega has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 10 years.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced new U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's oil Tuesday as well as banks in China and Iraq, warning that Tehran faces ""growing consequences"" for refusing to answer international questions about its nuclear program. Obama said China's Bank of Kunlun and the Elaf Islamic Bank in Iraq ""facilitated transactions worth millions of dollars"" for Iranian banks already under sanctions. ""By cutting off these financial institutions from the United States, today's action makes it clear that we will expose any financial institution, no matter where they are located, that allows the increasingly desperate Iranian regime to retain access to the international financial system,"" Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. On a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said the purpose of additional sanctions was to ""affect Iran's calculus"" to get Tehran to negotiate seriously over its disputed nuclear program. The United States will continue to ""look for ways to increase the impact"" of sanctions on Iran, Rhodes said. ""It's only going to get worse for the Iranian government,"" he said. Opinion: Romney on Iran is just like Obama . The sanctions announced Tuesday come on the heels of a complete European Union embargo on the purchase of Iranian petroleum that took effect at the beginning of the month, and the imposition of U.S. sanctions that cut off the U.S. financial system from any entity that facilitates the purchase of Iranian oil through the Central Bank of Iran. The United States recently granted exceptions to those sanctions to all major importers of Iranian oil based on evidence that those countries had significantly reduced their purchase of Iranian petroleum. Countries granted exceptions must demonstrate every 180 days their continued reduction of such purchases in order to avoid U.S. sanctions. The International Energy Association has said that exports of Iranian oil have dropped from a rate of 2.5 million barrels a day in 2011 to below 1.5 million barrels a day in June. On the same call Tuesday, Robert Einhorn, special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control at the State Department, said the drop represented a decline of 40% to 50%, and approximately $9 billion per quarter in lost revenue for Iran. The value of Iran's currency, the rial, has also dropped some 38% in value since international sanctions began to take effect the Obama administration said. In Tuesday's action, Obama issued an executive order against Iranian energy and petrochemical sectors in an effort to prevent the establishment of payment mechanisms that would allow the circumvention of existing sanctions. In addition to formal transactions of Iranian oil conducted through banks and other financial institutions, the new sanctions seek to punish purchases done through informal means or barter that have sought to go around existing sanctions targeting transactions through Iran's Central Bank. The executive order also broadens U.S. sanctions on any person or entity engaged in the purchase or acquisition from Iran's petrochemical industry, its second largest export industry behind oil. The petrochemical industry itself generates approximately $9 billion a year in foreign revenue for the Iranian government. The executive order also authorizes the Treasury Department to take actions that prevent Iran from getting access to U.S. dollars and precious metals, such as gold, in an effort to arrest the decline of its currency. ""These and other provisions send a clear signal to Iran that the Obama administration is determined to increase the pressure until Iranian leaders negotiate seriously"" over their nuclear program with the United States and its international partners, Einhorn said on the call. In announcing the action against the two banks, the Treasury Department said the sanctions were part of a wider effort to expose and isolate Iranian financial institutions connected to Iran's support for terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. ""Imposing sanctions on Kunlun and Elaf underscores Treasury's commitment to use all the tools at its disposal to intensify financial pressure against Iran while protecting the U.S. financial system from illicit activity,"" Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in a written statement. ""Any bank, anywhere, that seeks to provide a financial lifeline to Iran's designated financial institutions should know that it will be held accountable and its activity will be exposed."" On the call with reporters, Cohen said the ""collateral benefit"" of the sanctions is that Iran is finding it increasingly difficult to make payments in the international financial system, which in turn make it more difficult to procure materials for the nuclear program. The sanctions on Kunlun and Elaf would have a ""chilling effect"" on the willingness of other international financial institutions from doing business with Iranian banks Cohen said. Peres: Iran in 'open war' with Israel . Tuesday's actions from the administration come at the same time that negotiators in the House and Senate reached an agreement on even greater sanctions on Iran's energy and financial sectors. It is possible both chambers could vote on the measures later this week before the August recess. Rhodes told reporters the administration is reviewing the text of the legislation, but was ""quite optimistic"" the administration would ""continue to work in lock step with Congress"" on sanctions with Iran. Moments after the adminsitration made its announcement, an influential member of Congress made clear there was still work ahead. ""This legislation and today's executive action are important steps in the right direction, but not the final word on Iran sanctions,"" Rep. Howard Berman, D-California, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a written statement. ""Unless Iran agrees to end its weapons program, we must continue to pursue even tougher measures that would result in crippling sanctions on the Iranian regime."" In Tuesday's statement, Obama said Washington ""remains committed to a diplomatic solution, but the onus is on Iran to abide by its international obligations."" ""If the Iranian government continues its defiance, there should be no doubt that the United States and our partners will continue to impose increasing consequences,"" he said.

"Almaty, Kazakhstan (CNN) -- Representatives from six world powers and Iran wrapped up an inconclusive day at the negotiating table Friday in Kazakhstan after attempting to break the deadlock over Iran's controversial nuclear program. When negotiators from the six-nation diplomatic bloc last sat down with Iran's envoy in the Kazakh city of Almaty in February, they delivered what they characterized as a ""fair and balanced offer"" to defuse tensions over the Iranian nuclear program. ""We are waiting to see how Iran responds to the proposal we put on the table,"" Michael Mann, a European Union spokesman, told journalists shortly after negotiations resumed on Friday. By the end of the day, however, at least one Western diplomat expressed disappointment on the day's progress. ""We had a long and substantial discussion on the issues, but we remain a long way apart on the substance,"" said a Western diplomat, on condition of anonymity. Instead of delivering the ""concrete response"" Western governments had expected, Iran announced it is making its own proposal to the negotiating parties. Iran's deputy chief negotiator said the offer is based on a previous PowerPoint presentation that the Iranian delegation submitted during a round of talks in Moscow in June 2012. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran proposed a practical method to implement the Moscow plan in a smaller scale,"" Ali Baghery said in a statement issued to journalists Friday. The offer, he said, was aimed at establishing ""a new bedrock of cooperation."" Questions fly around any plan to attack Iran . Details of last February's offer from the six countries represented across the negotiating table from Iran have not yet been made public. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton described the offer as a ""very clear and concise proposal"" for confidence-building measures. Last month, technical experts from Iran and the so-called ""P5+1"" countries, which consist of the United States, France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia, met for more than 12 hours in Istanbul to discuss the proposal. Painful sanctions . The P5+1 governments are demanding that Iran come clean about its nuclear program, which they suspect includes covert development of nuclear weapons. Iran consistently denies those charges, arguing it is only enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors for peaceful civilian energy needs. But those arguments have failed to prevent Western governments from imposing draconian sanctions that are crippling the Iranian economy. Oil exports have plummeted over the past several years, as has the value of Iran's currency. Washington has vowed it will continue to put pressure on Tehran. ""As long as Iran does not take concrete steps to address the concerns of the international community about its nuclear program, the dual-track process continues. And that pressure only will increase if Iran does not begin to take concrete steps and concrete actions,"" said a senior U.S. administration official in a telephone briefing to journalists this week. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Lost revenue, foreign investment . Iran argues that as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, development of nuclear technology is an inalienable right. On the eve of the talks in Kazakhstan, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, repeated this position in a speech given at a university in Almaty. ""It is the right of the Iranian people to peaceful nuclear energy and most importantly to enrichment,"" Jalili said. A report recently published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace concluded that sanctions are unlikely to force Tehran to give up its nuclear program. The report, titled ""Iran's Nuclear Odyssey,"" highlighted the fact that Tehran's quest for a nuclear program has been going on for more than half a century, beginning under the rule of the pro-American shah, Reza Pahlavi, and continuing under the revolutionary Islamic republic that overthrew him. ""The program's cost -- measured in lost foreign investment and oil revenue -- has been well over $100 billion,"" Carnegie said. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We remain a long way apart on the substance,"" a Western diplomat says .

"(Parenting.com) -- We are pretty new to the youth sports world—my son is five—and I've already seen crazy parents and coaches and kids who are being pushed against their will. I just pray that my kid continues to have awesome coaches who understand what it's all about and how to keep things in age-appropriate perspective. Alex has his first soccer game on Saturday and his coach (who he's had for the past two seasons) wrote this in his first email: . ""My coaching philosophy is simple. We will win every game. Losing is not an option. Losing sucks! So start the kids on a raw steak diet and I will see all of you Monday at 5:15 for our first practice."" He was obviously poking fun at the youth sports culture we live in where kids start playing younger and get ultra competitive way too soon. And I loved it. And I honestly can't wait for the game this weekend. It's so great to see my kid having so much fun and playing well and getting such joy and confidence from his team and his coach. The thing is, a good coach can be the most amazing mentor to young kids, someone whose words they'll remember forever. But a bad coach—even one bad coach—can be beyond damaging and completely ruin a sport for a young person, and shake their confidence in irreparable ways. By now you've probably heard about the Rutgers men's basketball coach and how he was fired today after videos surfaced of him physically and verbally abusing his team over the past three years. I've watched the video a few times—it's the second most disturbing basketball video I've seen this week (the first would be Kevin Ware's horrific leg break). Parenting.com: Are kids' sports too competitive? The coach, Mike Rice, is seen kicking players, throwing balls at them (even at their heads!), pushing them and screaming terrible gay slurs. It's insane and hard to watch. The dude seems like a total nutcase who should seek help immediately and I can't believe the athletic director didn't do more when he first learned of this behavior last year (actually, of course I can believe it as we all know how effed up these big programs can be—hello, Penn State). And I can't even imagine what else those poor boys endured. That's the thing that gets me most now that I'm a mom: These are boys. Some of them fresh out of high school, their first time on their own and this is the kind of person they have looking out for them? Shaping them as men who will grow up to—guess what?—probably not play basketball. (The NCAA is the first to acknowledge the statistical unlikelihood of their players going pro.) Parenting.com: Competitive sports ... For toddlers? And I can only imagine what their parents must think seeing this video now. They probably invited this man into their homes for recruiting visits and trusted him with their impressionable boys, trusted him to mold them and inspire them and look out for them. It's infuriating. Now don't get me wrong, I know that coaching on this level is not about blowing sunshine up your team's butt. Rutgers is a big-time Division I program and this man's job is to get as many wins as possible. Coaches yell, they get frustrated, they may even freak out occasionally. I think athletes know this and certainly college athletes have been around long enough to understand that every coach has a different style and some are yellers. But -- and I can't believe this needs to be said -- throwing balls at a kid's head and calling him a ""fairy"" and worse is just plain unacceptable. I played Division I volleyball at The University of Tennessee and I can tell you it wasn't all clapping and positive reinforcement. Hardly. In all honesty, we had an emotionally abusive coach who was ultimately fired, but that's another story for another time. The point is, I get that it's tough, I get that it's not black and white. Parenting.com: 1 in 50: Real faces of autism . But I also get that there should be a line. And perhaps when you find yourself heaving a basketball at a kid's head, that line has been crossed. I have long been dubious of big-time college sports and what it does to the self-esteem and psyches of young people. And what, in the end, is the payoff for such a huge sacrifice (when you play D-I sports in a big program, it is pretty much all you do)? My experience—which was pretty awful and lasted only one year and is still something I rarely talk about—has influenced my feelings on this a lot. That's not to say I don't want my kids playing or that I don't believe in sports. Before college I was a die-hard athlete and loved every second of the sports culture. And I had some great coaches. I also had some so-so ones. And I saw plenty of the politicking that goes on, which is another icky reality we as parents need to be aware of. But I persevered. I love sports and I know how good they are for our kids. I wrote a story for Parenting's April issue -- ""The Risks and Rewards of Youth Sports"" -- that discusses all of this and more. We are in a brave new world and anyone whose kids play or will play should read it. Yes, youth sports are fantastic for our kids. But there are risks and other factors to consider. Including who are the people we trust to coach our children. Are they trained? Are they positive? Are they too focused on winning? Do they know what to do in case of injury? Are they ... abusive? I'm fascinated and frightened by all of it and I just hope I can maintain my convictions to never take any of it too seriously as my kids get older. A bad coach can change a person. And as a mother to kids who will likely be playing plenty of sports, stories like this Rutgers debacle stay with me and make me think. Parenting.com: Finding the best sports team for your child . Sure this is the college level which, when it comes to basketball, may as well be pro. But we hand over our kids—our little kids—to coaches all the time. Who knows what's going on at practice when we're not there? If your kid is anything like mine he's probably not giving you the blow-by-blow you want. So maybe it's not be a bad idea to ask the coach what his or her philosophy is before leaving the field next time. Would love to know what you guys think of this story. How did you react? What would you do if it was your son getting pegged in the head? Are you dubious of youth sports and the competitive nature? Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!!

"(CNN) -- The Chinese city of Wuhan produced Asia's first grand slam singles champion in Li Na and now the region is to be rewarded with its own WTA Tour event for 2014. Li made history by winning the 2011 French Open, and the world No. 6's hometown fans will have the chance to see their hero up close when the premier women's tennis circuit visits Wuhan -- a city of 10 million people in western China -- in September next year. ""It's a special city for me,"" the 30-year-old Li told the WTA Tour's official website. ""I was born there and grew up there. ""If my good friends on the Tour come to Wuhan, I will show how good the food they have is. And maybe they'll eat it first and then won't be able to move on the court!"" However, the Wuhan event is bad news for the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan, celebrating its 30th edition this year, which will exit the calendar to make room for what will be a fifth Chinese tournament in 2014. The WTA also announced Thursday the total prize fund available on the Tour outside of the four grand slams has risen to $58.7 million in 2013 from $53.3 million in 2012. With the 2014 soccer World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games to be staged in Brazil , the South American's growing sporting prominence has been recognized with the addition of a second Brazilian tournament in Florianopolis for 2014, adding to an event which will debut in Rio de Janiero this year. ""We are excited by the growth of women's professional tennis, particularly in key markets like China and Brazil,"" WTA chairwoman and CEO Stacey Allaster said in a statement highlighting the growing importance of the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). ""Development in the BRIC markets, led by China, has been a strategic priority for the past several years,"" added Allaster. ""We look forward to continued strengthening of our global brand, developing our sport, and building our fan base worldwide."" The 2013 calendar sees the circuit return to Poland -- home of world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska -- for the first time since 2010. Events in Katowice and Krakow will contribute to a total of 54 events in 33 countries in 2013. Meanwhile back on court, Radwanska continued her preparations for next week's Australian Open by reaching the final of the Sydney International event. In a semifinal battle between two women who had enjoyed perfect starts to 2013, Radwanska blotted Li's record with a 6-3 6-4 victory on Thursday. Radwanska, seeded fourth for the year's first grand slam, continued a run which led her to victory at another warmup event in Auckland, New Zealand last week. Sixth seed Li, who came into the Sydney tournament off the back of victory in Shenzhen, China, made Wimbledon runnerup Radwanska work for her triumph, saving an incredible seven match points before finally being beaten after one hour and 32 minutes. ""It was kind of like deja vu from the Auckland final -- there I think I also had seven or eight match points before I won,"" said the 23-year-old Radwanska after her win over an opponent who had beaten her on three occasions last year. ""My nerves were good, though,"" added the Pole. ""I had lost a couple of times against her last year, so I just went on the court pretty relaxed. The wind was a little bit difficult, especially in the first set -- a lot of framing. But the second set went much better."" Radwanska will face the tournament's surprise package Dominika Cibulkova in the final after the Czech world No. 15 beat German second seed Angelique Kerber 6-2 4-6 6-3. Cibulkova has also registered victories over 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and 2012 French Open finalist Sara Errani at the Sydney event.","The WTA Tour will hold a 2014 tournament in Li Na's hometown of Wuhan, China .

"(CNN) -- Suspected members of al Qaeda's Yemen wing ambushed an army vehicle on Friday and killed at least five soldiers, a government official told CNN. The incident took place in Marib province, in the western section of the country. Three other soldiers were injured in the ambush, conducted by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP. Yemen's government is unpopular among many citizens, and it has been facing a lot of street opposition in recent months, but it has been a U.S. ally in the fight against militants -- most prominently AQAP. In December, John Brennan, the administration's top counterterrorism adviser, said AQAP posed a greater threat to Americans than the bin Laden group based in Pakistan. Speaking at a forum at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he said AQAP was ""increasingly active"" in reaching out to find terrorist recruits, even in the United States. One of the key figures in the group is Anwar Al-Awlaki, the American-born radical Muslim cleric who moved to Yemen and has become a key figure in AQAP. A U.S. drone strike recently attempted but failed to kill al-Awlaki. This came after the U.S. military swooped into a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan on May 2, and killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Al-Awlaki has been linked to the suspect in the Fort Hood massacre of 13 people in 2009, as well as the suspect in the 2009 Christmas Day ""underwear bombing"" attempt in which a man allegedly tried to detonate an explosive device sewn into his underwear as his flight headed toward Detroit.

"(CNN) -- The task of replacing seven-time MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi at Ducati has been handed to his fellow Italian Andrea Dovizioso. Legendary rider Rossi will return to former team Yamaha Factory Racing on a two-year deal at the start of the 2013 season, a move which will see him reunited with fellow title winner and rival Jorge Lorenzo. Dovizioso, currently riding for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 satellite outfit, is fourth in the standings after 11 rounds of the 2012 season, 46 points ahead of Rossi. The 26-year-old will spend his sixth season in the elite division of motorbike racing at the Italian team, alongside American 2006 champion Nicky Hayden. ""It is with great pleasure that I welcome Andrea, as we marshal our best efforts in confronting the MotoGP World Championship,"" Ducati president Gabriele Del Torchio said of the 26-year-old on MotoGP's official website. ""Along with Nicky Hayden, with whom we have renewed a working agreement, we are confident that we will be able to proceed with our development program, to compete, and to obtain the results and rewards that will repay our efforts and the faith that our partners, sponsors and fans have never failed to demonstrate."" Dovizioso finished the 2011 championship in third position and will hope for better results at Ducati than Rossi achieved -- the 33-year-old has recorded just two podium finishes in 28 races. Ducati will be without Hayden for this weekend's Czech Grand Prix after he picked up a hand injury during a qualifying crash at the last race in Indianapolis, meaning Rossi will be the team's sole rider at Brno. Reigning world champion Casey Stoner, third in the 2012 riders' standings, will not race this weekend after a crash in the U.S. left the Australian with a fractured bone in his right ankle and torn ligaments. Despite picking up the injuries in qualifying ahead of the race, Stoner was still able to compete in the grand prix and register a fourth-place finish. Stoner will now fly from the Czech Republic to his homeland after doctors recommended he undergo surgery. ""It was always feeling like it was going to be this decision anyway,"" explained Stoner, who will retire at the end of the season. ""I was recommended by everyone not to race on Sunday in Indianapolis, so I didn't expect the situation to be better here. ""It's definitely disappointing; it's not what we wanted, especially in my last season ... In the later part of the season you never know what could have happened, but we'll keep pushing. ""I don't regret it [racing at Indianapolis]. I've never really followed people's orders with things like that in the past. But now, if another accident was to happen it would be huge damage. It's just frustrating to thing what we could have done without this injury.""","Andrea Dovizioso will replace the legendary Valentino Rossi at Ducati in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams stayed on course to become the first woman to win the Miami Masters six times but only just, after surviving a major scare against Dominika Cibulkova. At one point, the 13th seed from Slovakia led 6-2, 4-1 and seemed to have one foot in the quarterfinals until Williams, 31, displayed the fighting qualities that have made her one of the greats of the game. The world No. 1 rallied to win 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 and so book her place in the last eight, where she will take on China's Li Na, the fifth seed. ""I just thought to myself, 'Well, I've been down worse. It's nothing new. Just keep fighting',"" Williams -- whose five crowns are equaled only by Steffi Graf -- told reporters in Key Biscayne. ""I never give up. It doesn't matter whether it's in life or on the tennis court -- I keep fighting."" ""I was playing a really good opponent who plays really well. She's a good fighter and a great player,"" added the American, who is seeking her first Miami title to add to those won in 2002-2004 and 2007-2008. Unfortunately for Cibulkova however, the defeat marked the second year in a row where the 23-year-old has led the world's best by a significant distance in Miami only to fail to make it over the finish line. In 2012, the right-hander led Victoria Azarenka 6-1, 5-2 before succumbing to defeat. Meanwhile, Na was unconvincing as she made 39 unforced errors in a straight sets defeat of Spanish teenager Garbine Muguruza (7-6, 6-2). Playing her first tournament since injuring her ankle at January's Australian Open, Na let both a 5-1 lead in the first set -- and then a 6-1 lead in the tie break -- slip before dismissing the 19-year-old who had knocked out Caroline Wozniacki and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Defending champion Agnieszka Radwanska also had trouble making it through as the fourth seed recovered from losing the first set before seeing off the challenge of rising talent Sloane Stephens with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-0 win. Next up for the Pole is Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens, who saw off Croatia's Ajla Tomljanovic 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 to continue her best start to a season -- as she reached her fourth quarterfinal of the year. In the men's section, second seed Andy Murray saw off the challenge of Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets (7-6, 6-3) after the Bulgarian also let a decent lead slip. The 21-year-old had the chance to win the first set when serving at 5-3 but three double faults handed the Scot a lifeline. It is the second time in as many tournaments that Dimitrov has cracked when serving for a set against a top-ranked player, having served four double faults when leading world No. 1 Novak Djokovic 5-3 at Indian Wells earlier this month. Murray will face Italy's Andrea Seppi in the quarterfinals.","Serena Williams rallies from 2-6, 1-4 down to beat Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia .

"Washington (CNN) -- Her voice was halting, but not weak. Two years after being shot in the head by a gunman at a political event, former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords appeared at the first congressional hearing since last month's Connecticut school massacre to urge Congress to act now on gun violence. ""Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something,"" Giffords said in a rare public appearance Wednesday, reading a statement that acknowledged her injuries made it difficult to speak. ""It will be hard, but the time is now,"" she told the packed hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Teen who performed at Obama inaugural events shot dead in Chicago . The panel also heard from voices on both sides of the gun control issue in the nearly four-hour hearing that illustrated the deep political and ideological divisions over a longstanding issue. National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre blamed the government for failing to enforce existing gun laws and said new restrictions, including background checks, won't stop criminals from using weapons in violent crime. ""Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals, nor do we believe that government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families,"" he said. Democratic senators led by California's Dianne Feinstein, who is proposing a ban on semi-automatic rifles and ammunition magazines exceeding 10 rounds, argued that restricting access to such firepower and expanding background checks to as many gun sales as possible will help. Giffords' husband, retired astronaut and naval aviator Mark Kelly, called for a ""careful and civil conversation"" on new gun limits and a broad new acceptance of society's responsibility to keep firearms from dangerous people. ""Our rights are paramount. But our responsibilities are serious,"" he said. ""And as a nation, we are not taking responsibility for the gun rights our founding fathers have conferred upon us."" Opinion: Gun makers, help keep weapons out of criminals' hands . Sen. Patrick Leahy, the committee's Democratic chairman from Vermont, called for stronger background checks and a crackdown on so-called straw purchases, in which people who can pass background checks buy weapons for others. Leahy has proposed a measure to increase penalties for straw purchasers. However, Leahy avoided endorsing an expanded ban on the assault-style weapons called for by President Barack Obama and Feinstein. ""Second Amendment rights are the foundation on which our discussion rests. They are not at risk,"" Leahy said. ""But lives are at risk when responsible people fail to stand up for laws that will keep guns out of the hands of those who will use them to commit mass murder. I ask that we focus our discussion on additional statutory measures to better protect our children and all Americans."" The hearing came a few weeks after Obama announced legislative proposals aimed at curbing gun violence following the December 14 shootings that left 20 children and six adults dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. The shooter, Adam Lanza, also killed his mother and himself. How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . Obama's proposals include a ban on popular semi-automatic rifles that mimic assault weapons, a limit of 10 rounds per magazine, and universal background checks for anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale. Guns sold through private sales currently avoid background checks -- the so-called gun show loophole. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said at Wednesday's hearing that he is in talks with colleagues -- including several who are ranked highly by the NRA -- on possible legislation to expand background checks on private gun sales. Sources close to both Schumer and Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma told CNN the two were in serious discussions about co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen background checks. The NRA, which is the public face of the powerful gun lobby, opposes many government limits on gun ownership as a violation of the constitutional right to bear arms. LaPierre insisted Wednesday that the current background check system doesn't work, so expanding it would only create an unmanageable government bureaucracy instead of reducing gun crime in the country. Quick draw: How the NRA's LaPierre keeps his enemies guessing . ""The fact is the law right now is a failure, the way it's working,"" he said. ""The fact is that you have 76,000-some people that have been denied under the present law. Only 44 were prosecuted. You're letting them go. They're walking the streets."" Instead, he called for better enforcement of all existing gun laws and creating ""an immediate blanket of security around our children"" by putting armed guards at all the nation's schools. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney called LaPierre's statistic an intentional diversion ""from another issue that is part of this, which is the need for broader and universal background checks."" ""This is being pushed as a reason not to do something that the overwhelming majority of the American people support,"" Carney said, later adding that ""the skepticism you're hearing"" comes from those ""who don't want to do anything on this issue."" During the hearing, an exchange between LaPierre and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, showed the deeply held positions on each side. After LaPierre complained that expanded background checks would only burden law-abiding citizens and said they make no sense because criminals ignore the system, Durbin commented that the NRA official missed the point. Obama's gun violence measures: Would they work? ""The criminals won't go to purchase the guns because there will be a background check,"" Durbin said. ""We'll stop them from the original purchase. You missed that point completely. And I think it's basic."" LaPierre responded that it was Durbin who failed to understand, adding as Leahy banged his gavel for order that ""if you are not prosecuting them, you are not even stopping them."" He and other opponents of more gun control also depicted extreme scenarios of Americans under threat in their homes and at schools to make the case for access to semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. ""We all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane don't abide by the law,"" LaPierre said. Another witness, Gayle Trotter of the Independent Women's Forum, repeatedly described scenes of women at home with their children needing weapons that would be banned under Feinstein's proposal to fight off bigger, stronger male attackers. ""An assault weapon in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon and the peace of mind that a woman has as she's facing three, four, five violent attackers, intruders in her home with her children screaming in the background, the peace of mind that she has knowing that she has a scary looking gun gives her more courage when she's fighting hard and violent criminals,"" Trotter said. ""If we ban these types of assault weapons, you are putting women at a great disadvantage."" Other witnesses and senators who support tougher regulations countered that the constitutional right to bear arms can be limited, for example, by the existing ban on private citizens possessing grenade launchers and other military weaponry. Why would someone own a military-style rifle? ""I think most people believe that, sure, we could have guards at schools,"" Feinstein said, making a reference to the Columbine, Colorado, school massacre in 1999 in which two students killed 13 people before shooting themselves. ""I'm well aware that at Columbine there was a deputy sheriff who was armed who actually took a shot but couldn't hit the shooter there. The question comes, what do you do about the malls then? What do you do about our movie theaters? What do you do about businesses. We can't have a totally armed society."" The police chief of Baltimore County in Maryland, James Johnson, endorsed what he called the holistic approach urged by Obama to create a system that reduces access to guns for people who shouldn't have them. ""The best way to stop a bad guy from getting a gun in the first place is a good background check,"" said Johnson, the chairman of the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence. However, Denver University law professor David Kopel said the Supreme Court made clear in a Washington, D.C., case that gun controls could not include weapons used commonly by law-abiding citizens, such as the top-selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that Feinstein's legislation would ban. NRA chief: Obama makes 'mockery' of American freedoms . The hearing showed agreement in concept on some issues, such as strengthening mental health screening.

The NRA's membership has spiked by 500,000 people since the Newtown shooting, bringing its number to more than 4.5 million, the group said Wednesday.

On Tuesday, Kelly said that despite the Tucson, Arizona, shooting that wounded his wife and killed six others, he and Giffords still support the Second Amendment, which guarantees Americans the right to possess firearms. ""But we really need to do something about the safety of our kids and our communities. It's gotten really out of hand,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Wheeling around the skies above the ferry boats and cargo ships, seagulls are as a familiar sight above the Bosphorus as the commuters and containers on it. Their enduring presence on Istanbul's busy waterway will soon be further cemented with the construction of a new transport hub designed to look like the seabird in flight. Perched on the western shores of the Bosphorus, the Kabatas Seagull Transportation Hub will enable new and improved connections for ferries, trains, buses and some small ships, says Ali Ulvi Altan, director of major projects for Hakan Kiran Architecture. Infographic: Historic hub where east meets west . ""Today this area carries around 60,000 passengers per day ... when [the hub is completed it will carry] around 90,000 persons per day by our estimates,"" Altan said. The seagull was a natural choice for the design, says Altan, because the bird is the symbol of the Bosphorus. The Istanbul-based architects will be assisted by Dutch engineering company, Royal HaskoningDHV who will be providing geotechnical, environmental and maritime expertise. In addition to its iconic design, the project will incorporate green features such as rainwater collection and a renewable energy facility. Work on the building is due to start next year, Altan says, and should be completed by 2015/16.","A new seagull-shaped transport hub is to built on the banks of the Bosphorus .

"(CNN) -- Military intervention in Mali has been swift -- it took only a few months for foreign forces to step in to start helping the population. Yet 10 years ago, the conflict in Darfur began. Many Darfuris are still waiting for the international community to help stop the bloodshed and ethnic cleansing. Civilians are still being systematically targeted, raped and killed and a recent upsurge in state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses is particularly worrying. Yet the response from the international community is to look the other way. Watch video: Warning of new Sudan disaster . Why the rush to help Mali while Darfur has suffered for a decade? Quite simply, the answer is fear. As British Prime Minister David Cameron claimed this January, all of North Africa is becoming a ""magnet"" for jihadists from other countries. The West is worried about the possibility of an Islamist-aligned state, one that could offer a base to jihadist groups, allowing them to promote and export its extremist ideology -- a new Afghanistan, just when the international community's intervention there is set to wind down. But the international community already confronts a similar reality in Sudan -- it just fails to truly understand the ugly nature of President Omar al-Bashir's regime. You only have to take a look at the friends he keeps, including Iran -- designated by the U.S. government as a sponsor of international terrorism. And let's not forget Sudan's long history of harboring global terrorists. In the early 1990s this included international terrorist ""most wanted, Osama bin Laden. Even today, analysts think elements of al Qaeda and other international jihadists still linger in Sudan, and at the beginning of this year, an al Qaeda student wing was established at Khartoum University. Domestically, the Sudanese government promotes a violent, extreme form of Sharia law. At the very least this means anyone who fails to live by their strict and extreme interpretation of Islamism is castigated with public floggings and jail sentences. Moderate Muslims who signed the New Dawn Charter in January -- separating religion from state -- were labeled non-believers and infidels. At worst, Khartoum's attempt to establish a racially pure Islamic state involves waging war against its own unarmed civilians, systematically and with impunity. In Darfur this has lasted a decade. The U.N. estimates that 300,000 Darfuris have died since 2003, but it hasn't bothered to estimate casualty numbers since 2008. With fighting continuing to this day, the number is likely to be far higher. However, since these human-rights violations occur in a media vacuum the world assumes ""Darfur is over."" It isn't -- and won't be until the international community stops applying a lesser standard to Darfuris than to others who have needed its help. That's why a coalition of Darfuri organizations, like the Darfur Union and NGOs like Waging Peace -- which campaigns against genocide and human rights abuses in Sudan -- are launching a new campaign, Darfur10, to bring this war-torn region back onto the international agenda. Taking action need not require lengthy international negotiations. Let's just start by finally implementing the numerous U.N. resolutions against Sudan since 2004. Targeted smart sanctions against the personal finances of the architects of Darfur's genocide would help. As would travel bans for high-ranking officials, stocking up on luxury goods from Paris. And no-fly zones would stop the government's Antonovs from bombing Darfuri citizens. But addressing the underlying cause of Sudan's troubles means ensuring al-Bashir and others in his regime are brought to the International Criminal Court to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Media outlets are already publishing retrospectives on Darfur, 10 years on. But for the inhabitants of this blighted land, we are still staring the conflict in the face -- every day. It's time to take action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hussain Begira .","10 years after conflict began, Darfuris still waiting for end to bloodshed, says Hussain Begira .

"(CNN) -- If rumors that Cristiano Ronaldo might be dropped for Real Madrid's trip to Valencia were a ploy from coach Jose Mourinho to inspire his fellow Portuguese to greater heights, it was an unquestionable success. The two were reported to have had a frank exchange of views after Real's midweek win over Valencia in the Spanish Cup, leading to stories that Ronaldo would be asked to sit on the substitutes bench. But he wasn't. He started and demonstrated why he is lauded as one of the world's best players by helping himself to two goals and an assist as Real won 5-0 to claw back a little ground on runaway leaders Barcelona. The damage was done in the first half, as Real raced into a five-goal lead inside the opening 45 minutes. Argentina international Gonzalo Higuain opened the scoring on nine minutes as he polished off a swift Real counter attack from fellow countryman Angel Di Maria's cutback. Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves had to save twice from Germany midfielder Sami Khedira before Ronaldo made headway down the left and crossed for Di Maria to tap into an empty net. A minute later it was 3-0 as Mesut Ozil released Ronaldo and he fired home at the near post to effectively end the contest. Ronaldo grabbed his second and Real's fourth on 41 minutes when he again finished off a pass from Ozil and the German playmaker was the provider on the stroke of halftime as he sent Di Maria away to grab his second. Valencia improved after the break and tested Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas -- recently dropped by Mourinho -- several times but Real held firm. Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid maintained their seven point lead over their city rivals in second with a comfortable 2-0 win over Levante, though their star striker Falcao limped off with injury. Adrian and Koke grabbed the goals for Atletico, who remain eight points behind Barcelona. Osasuna beat Deportivo La Coruna 2-1 while goals from Javi Guerra and Óscar González helped Real Valladolid to a 2-0 victory over Real Zaragoza. In Italy, Inter stayed fourth in the Serie A table after a 1-1 draw away at AS Roma before news broke that their Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder had agreed to join Turkish club Galatasaray. City neighbors AC Milan beat Bologna 2-1 at the San Siro while Fiorentina and Napoli drew 1-1. In France big-spending Paris St-Germain won 1-0 away at Bordeaux to move top of Ligue 1 thanks to their Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Stade Rennes and Nice were also winners on Sunday. In Germany, Nurnberg drew 1-1 with Hamburg while Augsburg won 3-2 away at Fortuna Düsseldorf.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Real Madrid thrash Valencia 5-0 in La Liga .

"(CNN) -- David Ferrer will aim to become the first Spaniard to win the Miami Masters after beating Germany's Tommy Haas in an absorbing semifinal on Friday. The trophy has proved beyond the reach of three of his compatriots in the past, with Rafael Nadal having failed on three occasions (2005, 2008, 2011) to add to previous failures by Carlos Moya (2003) and Sergi Bruguera (1997). The third seed, who celebrates his 31st birthday on Tuesday, will play either Andy Murray or Richard Gasquet in Sunday's final after recovering from a break down in the third set to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. The world No. 5 finally ended a fine championships for Haas who, at 34, was bidding to become the oldest man to reach the final since Jimmy Connors in 1988. The German, who slayed world No. 1 and defending champion Novak Djovokic in the quarterfinals, took his fine form into the clash as he powered his way to the first set in Key Biscayne. Losing the opener only served to focus Ferrer's concentration however and he broke Haas in the sixth game of the second before repeating the feat to take the set 6-2. When Haas broke in the first and third games of the third set, the German seemed to have regained the initiative only for Ferrer to find his way back into the match through his trademark resilience. 2013 has started in superb fashion for the Spaniard, who can win his third title of the year on Sunday -- with the Australian Open semifinalist having already triumphed in Auckland and Buenos Aires. Ferrer is into his fifth ATP World Tour Masters 1000 final although his only success came last November when beating Poland's Jerzy Janowicz in Paris. While no Spanish male has ever lifted the title in Key Biscayne, the ladies' trophy has previously been claimed by Spain -- with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario beating Gabriela Sabatini in 1992, before defending her crown against Steffi Graf the following year.","David Ferrer ends run of Germany's Tommy Haas with 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory in semifinal .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to airline alliances, there is safety and profitability in numbers -- even more so as the industry tries to stave off the worst effects of the Great Recession and sluggish recovery, where we have seen mergers and code share agreements. All the major European airlines are part of one of the three big alliances. There is Star (the biggest) based around Lufthansa and United Airlines; Skyteam based around Air France/KLM and Delta; and Oneworld based around BA and American Airlines. Alliances are a key part of the aviation industry. According to Oneworld CEO Bruce Ashby, 86% of the revenue from travel between the world's top 100 cities business is booked with alliances. ""Passengers who travel for business are heavily invested in alliances carriers,"" he says. Oneworld has marked a milestone in airline alliance history with its newest member Qatar Airways being the first Gulf carrier to join an alliance. Competition between the ""Big Three"" (Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways) is rife and now that Qatar has made this bold step to join Oneworld, the impact of Gulf carriers on the industry and the relationships they choose to forge are being followed more closely than ever before, to see how airlines and alliances will respond. See also: Gulf hubs become travel hotspots . ""As more airlines are aligned and more consolidation occurs, alliances actually end up competing for members in some ways,"" said Bruce Ashby, CEO of the Oneworld alliance. ""Now that more and more airlines belong, the tension between them has grown."" For other Gulf carriers, a cosy codeshare with different alliances is as far as they'll go. Emirates has codeshare agreements with Oneworld carrier Qantas and, most recently, with Star Alliance member TAP Portugal. Skyteam welcomes Air France's partnership with Etihad and Air Berlin, where Etihad owns 29% of the German airline. ""Gulf carriers and their hubs are well-positioned geographically for a number of major traffic flows, both within the Gulf region itself and between other continents"" said Michael Wisburn, CEO of Skyteam. ""These Gulf carriers have developed substantial capacity with high transfer capabilities, making these airlines and their hubs relevant players in aviation today, both in terms of industry developments and possible further consolidation,"" he added. Although Etihad has not joined an alliance, Skyteam member Air France says it's a case of ""if you can't beat'em, join'em."" ""When you see geographically the way the world is built, Gulf carriers bring significant improvement to the alliances,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, president and CEO of Air France in an exclusive interview with CNN -- his first international television appearance since being appointed. Watch video: Etihad rejects airline alliances . When asked about doing business with Air Berlin -- which is a member of a rival alliance Oneworld -- Juniac candidly said: ""In the future if our ties with Etihad and Air Berlin become closer, Air Berlin will have to make a decision about which alliance they want to belong to. The decision is in their hands."" Air Berlin, Germany's second largest carrier after Lufthansa, has only been a member of Oneworld since March last year and if it were ever to leave, the alliance wouldn't let it go quietly. ""We would regret it very deeply if Air Berlin left Oneworld,"" says Ashby. ""We like Air Berlin and they add a lot of value to us and we think we add a lot of value to them, by the way. ""It would be easier if we had exclusive clubs and we said 'if you join my club you can't use any other club,' but this is the airline business and it's completely impractical. We would be sad to see them leave. I would definitely put up a fight if I thought it were necessary."" Watch video: 'Gulf Three' shake up global aviation . Star Alliance is monitoring this relationship closely, especially because its chief member, Lufthansa, is the only major European airline that hasn't teamed up with a Gulf carrier. Even so, Star Alliance says it doesn't feel left out or threatened. ""We're the only global alliance that flies to all of the countries in the Middle East and we really have no aspirations to have one of the carriers in the Gulf join our alliance,"" says Mark Schwab, CEO for Star Alliance, which has 27 members. He adds: ""Fifteen years of Star Alliance, 21,900 flights a day, 192 countries, 1,330 cities we fly to -- we have Turkish Airlines in the vicinity, also EgyptAir, so we're not feeling any kind of commercial pressure."" And for airlines like south-east Asia's Royal Brunei, which are too small for it to be worth their while joining an alliance, the best way to compete is not to compete. ""I think you have to cut your cloth in this industry,"" says Royal Brunei deputy chairman Dermot Mannion. ""The Gulf carriers have put a lot of capacity into the region over the last five-six years and that's had an impact on all the airlines, especially the kangaroo traffic between the UK, Australia and New Zealand. ""We've cut capacity, we closed routes to Brisbane, Perth and Auckland. We are backing off competing against the Gulf carriers and focusing on what we do best -- ASEAN. That way we can happily co-exist with the Gulf carriers."" According to the International Air transport Association, airlines were expected to return a profit of $6.7 billion at the end of 2012, only slightly improving to $8.4 billion in 2013. Adding capacity and connecting continents, Gulf carriers will continue to play a crucial role in helping airlines and alliances expand their networks, filling their geographical gaps.

"(CNN) -- Victoria Azarenka has been forced to withdraw from the Dubai Open for the second successive year after suffering an injured heel. Azarenka, who surrendered the World No.1 spot Monday to Serena Williams, was hoping to build on her title win at the Qatar Open where she defeated the U.S. star. The Belorussian would have regained the No.1 ranking had she won the tournament, but Williams is set to remain at the summit until the Indian Wells tournament next month. ""I'm very disappointed, but I have to listen to my body,"" Azarenka told reporters. ""The injury happened last week when I played a lot of tennis, so going on to a new tournament is just too much. The heel kept getting worse, and I needed to re-evaluate. ""Sometimes the schedule is just too difficult. Unfortunately you can't know when you plan it in November what will happen in February. ""I didn't want to continue taking painkillers because sometimes it's better to feel the pain. so that you can control the injury. Otherwise it can cause something which is much worse. ""This is just a warning that I have to take care of myself."" Azarenka, who has a 14-0 record this year, revealed that the physical demands of the schedule has become a growing concern since she won the Australian Open last month. ""I never realised before just how much it takes out of you,"" she said. ""Physically and mentally it just drains you out - and then you realise."" Meanwhile, Williams, who is the oldest woman to ever hold top spot in the rankings, is the big favorite for the $2 million tournament. And the 31-year-old says she's feeling in rude health going into the competition. She told reporters: ""I was really, really, really, really sick last week and physically I just wasn't at my best, considering I couldn't train, and I didn't practice. ""I practised only one or two days before playing because I had the ankle problems. ""But I didn't want to not show up and not play. So at least if I could show up and play my way into shape I would be able to compete and that's what I did. ""I feel so much better this week already.

"(CNN) -- Cubans used to have to clear numerous hurdles to leave their island. But that is to change in a few days, much to the joy of people like Ernesto Garcia. ""It completely surprised us,"" the Havana resident said of Cuba's new travel policy, announced last fall and set to take effect Monday. ""This great news is taking away a load our shoulders."" So does this mean all Cubans can pack their bags, destined for wherever? Not necessarily. After weeks in which passport applications surged and just days before the new policy takes affect, Cuba this week ""began to increase the information about the update announced last October,"" according to a story from the state-run Prensa Latina News Agency. Specifically, the Labor and Social Security Ministry defined categories of Cubans whose travel would be restricted. They include those who may be ""criminally prosecuted, are subject to military service or (are denied) for reasons of defense and national security."" ""Also on the list are citizens who have obligations with the state or are not authorized under rules designed to preserve the skilled workforce and protect official information,"" read the Presna Latina story. It's not clear, exactly, how sweeping these restrictions will be or why they were announced this week. Col. Lambert Fraga, deputy chief of Cuba's immigration department, explained the government would exercise its prerogative ""to protect the scientific, professional and technical fields, as well as key athletes who help the socio-economic development of the country."" Such restrictions are necessary, Fraga told Prensa Latina, ""to defend the supreme interests of society."" And even with them, the Cuban official said he expected ""most applications will have a positive response."" When announced October 16, the new policy promised to make things easier for would-be Cuban travelers. They'd no longer need an exit permit or an invitation letter from someone in the country they were heading, nor would they have to pay about $200 to process paperwork, state media reported. With a parent or legal guardian's permission, children under 18 would now be able to travel abroad. They would be able to be off the island as long as 24 months -- not 11, as was previously the case -- and remain a Cuban citizen. This gives people a chance to obtain and keep longer better-paying jobs outside Cuba, where the average monthly income works out to about $20 U.S. Instead, they'd only need a valid passport and an entry visa for the country where they were headed. But while Cuba won't grant exit visas any longer, it appears the country can deny passports. A story Friday in the state-run Granma newspaper criticized what it called the U.S. ""hostile policy toward Cuba"" that contributed to ""brain drain,"" claiming many Cuban doctors and other professionals had emigrated at their home nation's expense. Illeana Sorolla, head of the University of Havana's Center for the Study of International Immigration, called out Washington's preference for ""more skilled people,"" while Granma also said U.S. immigration policies favor activists or others who advocate change in Cuba. The U.S. State Department weighed in Friday, with spokeswoman Victoria Nuland noting Cuban citizens still need a valid U.S. visa or entry authorization to legally get into the United States, whatever Cuba's policy is. At the same time, she insisted all Cubans -- whatever their skill set or background -- should have the same right to travel. ""The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that every individual has the right to leave any country, including his/her own, and the right to return,"" Nuland said. ""The United States welcomes any reforms that allow Cubans to depart from and return to their country freely."" CNN's Adriana Hauser contributed to this report.","Cuba says its residents won't need exit permit or invitation from another country .
The new policy, which takes effect Monday, also does away with fees that can run to $200 .

"London (CNN) -- Margaret Thatcher was ""an extraordinary leader and an extraordinary woman,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a special session of Parliament Wednesday. He led tributes to Britain's only female prime minister two days after her death at age 87 from a stroke. Meanwhile, Thatcher's son Mark said that although his mother had been ""blessed with a long life and a very full one,"" the family's loss is still difficult to bear. The family is ""enormously proud"" and grateful that Queen Elizabeth II will attend her funeral next week, he said. The lawmakers have been called back early from recess for the special parliamentary session to honor Margaret Thatcher's memory. Thatcher led the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 and was prime minister for 11 years. Cameron told lawmakers it is important not to underestimate the ""thickness of the glass ceiling"" she faced at that time. Her achievement in breaking through it to become a member of Parliament, then a minister and then prime minister was remarkable, he said. He also praised her leadership in the Falklands War in 1982, when Britain repelled an Argentinian invasion of the disputed Falkland Islands, also known as the Malvinas. While prime minister, Thatcher lived under ""direct personal threat"" from the Irish Republican Army, Cameron added. He paid tribute to her courage as he recalled that she lost two parliamentary colleagues to IRA terrorism, and was ""inches away from death"" in a 1984 IRA bomb attack on a Brighton hotel where lawmakers were staying during a Conservative Party conference. The funeral with military honors planned for next Wednesday will be a ""fitting"" tribute, Cameron said. ""She made the political weather, she made history, and let this be her epitaph: She made Britain great again,"" he concluded. Praise and criticism from the opposition . Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher's achievements but at the same time pointed out he disagreed with many of her decisions. ""Whatever your view of her, Margaret Thatcher was a unique and towering figure,"" he said, and a ""prime minister who defined her age."" She was right to see that the British economy needed to change, to encourage aspiration and to defend the Falkland Islands when Argentina invaded, he said. But it would be dishonest not to say that she was wrong on other things, he said. These include calling Nelson Mandela's African National Congress a terrorist organization, passing legislation that made it illegal to ""promote"" homosexuality in schools, and her treatment of Britain's coal miners when she took on the trades unions. Many in mining communities felt ""angry and abandoned,"" he said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, of the Liberal Democrat party, kept his remarks brief -- pointing out that Thatcher's legacy still provokes strong feelings in many people in his northern England constituency. But whatever your views of her policies, he said, ""it's impossible to deny the indelible imprint Margaret Thatcher made both on the nation and the wider world."" She was a towering figure ""not as written in the history books but still in the prime of her political life,"" he said. The comments from those outside her party reflect the fact that Thatcher was a highly polarizing leader, whose influence on British politics is still felt more than 20 years after she left office. There were noticeably more empty seats on the opposition side of the chamber in the House of Commons. But many on both sides of the house laughed, sometimes fondly and sometimes ruefully, as lawmakers recounted anecdotes about their own interactions with Thatcher. She earned the nickname ""the Iron Lady"" for her personal and political toughness in office. The session in the House of Commons is expected to last several hours. The House of Lords, where Thatcher served after she was ennobled to Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven following her departure from office, is also holding a session in her honor. Former Conservative leader Michael Howard, now Lord Howard, defended her approach to decision-making, seen by many as divisive. ""If she had waited for consensus, nothing would ever have happened,"" he said. ""She saw what needed to be done and she did it, with clarity, with courage and with compassion."" Very few people have made a contribution to the nation on the scale of that of Thatcher, he said, and ""the light of her legacy will shine as a beacon down the generations."" Lord Norman Tebbit, a former chairman of the Conservative Party and a Cabinet minister under Thatcher, recalled her kindness to him and his wife after they were badly injured in the Brighton bombing. Working for her was made easier by the firmness of her convictions, he added. The last time both houses of Parliament were recalled during a recess was in summer 2011, when London and other cities were rocked by riots and looting. Divided opinion . A towering figure in postwar British and global politics, Thatcher is remembered in the world for her Cold War-era friendships with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as well as her role in shaping Britain's place in Europe and the short, sharp war she waged with Argentina over the disputed Falkland Islands. At home, she divides opinion. Many Britons blame her for creating soaring unemployment, when she reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to business and took on the unions. Her battle with striking coal miners won her few friends in mining communities in northern England and Wales. But supporters believe the tough reforms she pushed through transformed the British economy and gave many working people new freedoms. Preparations are already under way for a funeral to be held next Wednesday at St. Paul's Cathedral. With full military honors, it will rival those given to Diana, Princess of Wales and the Queen Mother. The queen, accompanied by husband Prince Philip, will be among the high-profile guests. What do you think about the loss of Britain's 'Iron lady'? Tell us . However, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, who's expecting their first child, will not attend the funeral, nor will Prince Harry, Prince Charles or his wife, Camilla, Buckingham Palace said. The announcement that Thatcher would receive a ""ceremonial"" style funeral, one step down from the state funeral usually reserved for the monarch, has prompted heated debate in the United Kingdom. While some supporters want her to be given a state funeral, others have questioned whether she merits a send-off on par with that of Diana's. Opinion: Why Thatcher was the 'Iron Lady' The service, which will be televised, will be followed by a private cremation, Cameron's office said Tuesday. Crowds are expected to line the streets between the Palace of Westminster -- where her coffin will lie on the eve of the funeral -- and St. Paul's Cathedral. On the day of the funeral, the coffin will travel by hearse from Westminster to a Royal Air Force chapel, where it will be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the King's Troop Royal Artillery. From there, it will be taken in procession to St. Paul's Cathedral along a route lined by servicemen and women from the army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Thatcher's family and friends will wait inside the cathedral with many who worked with her in government and elsewhere. The funeral is being organized in line with the wishes of her family, Downing Street said. They include her twin children, Mark and Carol.

"(CNN) -- Airport layovers can be the most gruesome leg of a journey. But airports are increasingly getting wise to the needs of their passengers, offering a range of amenities from swimming pools to yoga studios and even a golf course. Last year, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport decided it wanted to become ""the healthiest airport in the country, if not the world,"" according to spokeswoman Cynthia Vega. They started by ensuring every one of their restaurants had a low-fat, ""healthy heart"" option. Next, they introduced a 700-meter walking path and opened a yoga studio free for passengers to use. ""You know what it's like being trapped in the airport. You can only eat so much food or read so many magazines,"" says Vega. ""There is an inherent stress that goes along with traveling. This is a good way to shake it off."" Increasingly, airports are becoming more and more defined by their amenities. Hong Kong International is known by many golfers for its nine-hole course, visitors to Seoul can take a spin on the ice skating rink at Incheon Airport, while travelers can take in an art exhibit or a classical piano lesson while on layover in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. Read more: Airport dating: Love at first flight? Arguably, Singapore's Changi Airport spearheaded the trend back in the mid-1990s, when it introduced a rooftop swimming pool and free internet terminals. In recent years, Changi has continued to innovate, implementing a 24-hour complimentary movie theater, free gaming rooms as well as foot massage and napping stations. Two of their more off-beat recent additions include the world's largest kinetic sculpture and an indoor slide. ""Passengers' demands have changed considerably over the years,"" notes Ivan Tan, a spokesman for Changi. ""The airport is no longer an inconsequential stop along the way, but a destination on its own."" Though the modern airport is often compared to a shopping mall, Curtis Fentress, the architect who designed Incheon Airport and is currently overseeing the $1.5 billion modernization of Los Angeles Airport, finds it would be more accurate to view it as a mini city. ""While it's true there is more shopping than ever in today's airports, there's also more dining, more entertainment, and more culture,"" he says. ""For those who travel constantly, airports are the new hometown."" Delta Airlines have been particularly keen to upgrade the airport experience at their terminals. To date, they've invested $1.2 billion in their new terminal at New York's JFK airport (set to open in May), and $160 million to spruce up their LaGuardia presence. According to Gail Grimmett, the senior vice president for Delta in New York, their aim is to make traveling more comfortable, but also, to provide a taste of the city beyond the airport walls. To accomplish this, Delta threw out all the fast food outlets that are often de rigueur, and replaced them with restaurants helmed by the New York City culinary elite, including alumni from such notable city venues as Balthazar, Morimoto and the Brooklyn Brewery. ""We wanted to provide a true New York experience,"" she explains. Read more: A new generation of airport hotels . The airline has also been a leader in using technology to upgrade the passenger experience. At both their LaGuardia and JFK terminals, Delta has introduced iPads at departure gates and in a handful of restaurants. Passengers can use the devices to read the paper, or order food and retail goods directly to their seats. ""When you walk through the airport, the whole vibe is different,"" notes Grimmett. ""Even on days when it's raining, or flights are delayed, there's such a sense of serenity, because we've given people what they want while their waiting: good food, a comfortable place to sit, and the ability to plug in and do work."" Grimmett notes that since adding these features, Delta's customer satisfaction scores ""have skyrocketed."" Of course, it was only a matter of time before other airports followed suit. Dallas Fort Worth was one of the first airports to create a mobile app that can help users find a parking space, check out the nearest concessions, and use GPS to map the closest stores and food outlets. ""We're a really user-friendly airport, which is a challenge, given we're huge; we're the size of Manhattan,"" says Vega. The upgraded experience is just as beneficial for the airports, whose income is increasingly made up of cash pulled in from retail, food and any other source not directly related to flight. Fentress figures that within a few years, ""the majority of airport revenue will be non-aeronautical.""

"(CNN) -- A campaign rally for Ecuador's president turned deadly Monday night when a man stabbed and killed two people, state media reported. At least four others were injured at the event that President Rafael Correa was expected to arrive at moments later, the state news agency ANDES said. ANDES posted a video showing a man apparently stabbing victims at random in a crowd of more than 100 people in the northern province of Esmeraldas. Some in the crowd tried to stop the attacker, but he ran away. Correa called the attack against his supporters from the Alianza Pais movement a tragedy. Interior Minister Jose Serrano said a suspect has been detained. ""The national police proceeded to capture the suspect of these events. (But) we can not say, absolutely, that the person who is detained at this moment is the author of the unfortunate event,"" Serrano told reporters. On his Twitter account, the president described the video as ""really chilling."" He sent a message of ""solidarity to the families of the victims."" ANDES reported that the president suspended ""all political acts"" and returned to the city of Esmeraldas.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Muslim-Christian sectarian violence intensified in Egypt this weekend, spurring an emergency meeting of the Cabinet and public exhortations from Coptic Christians for international protection. At least 12 people were killed and 232 others were wounded in sectarian clashes outside a Cairo church, according to state TV. Officials said violence began over rumors that a Christian woman who converted to Islam was being held at the church against her will. Prime Minister Essam Sharaf postponed a trip to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates to discuss the church attack and hold the emergency meeting, according to EgyNews, Egypt's official news agency. A small group of Coptic Christians gathering near the U.S. Embassy in Cairo on Sunday called for international protection of Egypt's Christian community and condemned the government for not doing more to protect them. Reporter's Notebook: Mere steps ahead of an angry Cairo mob . Small groups composed of Christians and Muslims engaged in heated debate sectarian tensions mounted, but they were peaceful. Soldiers stood in a line across the road to prevent protesters from approaching the U.S. embassy. In the Cairo neighborhood of Maspiro, violence erupted when several hundred people, predominantly Christian but also Muslims, demonstrated in favor of national unity in front of the TV building. Stones were hurled and people threw bricks from rooftops on predominantly Christian protesters. Some people were injured. Chants could be heard of ""with our souls and blood we will sacrifice ourselves for the cross."" Military riot police with red helmets and clubs separated mutually hostile crowds. Problems between Egypt's Muslim majority and its Coptic Christian minority have been on the rise in recent months, with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups. Tensions flared after a recently-published U.S. government report on international religious freedom detailed the hostility targeting the minority Copts in the predominantly Muslim society. During clashes on Saturday, witnesses said an armed group of Muslims marched on Saint Mena Coptic Orthodox Church, one of the oldest churches in Egypt. Witnesses said Muslims and Christians exchanged gunfire, sending people running for cover. ""With my own eyes I saw three people killed and dozens injured,"" said Mina Adel, a Christian resident. ""There's no security here. There's a big problem. People attacked us, and we have to protect ourselves."" There were conflicting reports about who attacked the church. Some witnesses said the group was made up of Muslim fundamentalists, known as Salafists. Others, including Interior Ministry spokesman Alla Mahmoud, said it was angry Muslims from a nearby mosque. Mahmoud said the clashes were sparked by reports of a Christian woman who married a Muslim man and was allegedly being held inside the church. Military, special forces and riot police were called in to try to break up the violence, firing warning shots in the air, according to witnesses. At the same time, at the nearby Coptic Church of the Holy Virgin, firefighters responded to a blaze that witnesses said appeared to have been started by the members of the same group that attacked the other church. Hundreds of residents in the working class neighborhood of Imbaba stood outside as the church burned and two men were seen jumping from a window of the building, according to witnesses. Across the street, residents standing outside the Al Wehda mosque blamed ""thugs"" for the violence. ""It was thugs who burned the church, not Salafists (fundamentalists),"" said Jamal El Banan. ""We never had such sedition before the revolution."" Tensions were high in the neighborhood following the clashes, with soldiers firing shots into the air overnight to break up the crowd, witnesses said. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman, based in Cairo, described the crowd as ""very hostile,"" saying he was forced to leave the neighborhood after his vehicle was targeted with rocks. A Coptic church in the town of Alexandria was bombed on New Year's Day, killing 23 people -- the deadliest attack on Christians in Egypt in recent times. Ten days later, a gunman killed a Christian man and wounded five others on a train in Egypt. In November, a group with ties to al Qaeda in Iraq announced that all Christians in the Middle East would be ""legitimate targets,"" as the group's deadline for Egypt's Coptic church to release alleged Muslim female prisoners expired. The group's claim that the Coptic Church in Egypt is holding female prisoners is based on widespread rumors of Coptic women in Egypt converting to Islam and being detained by the church in an attempt to compel or persuade them to return to their original faith. About 9% of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion split with other Christians in the 5th century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan federal agency, last month added Egypt to a list of countries named as the worst violators of religious freedom. ""The Egyptian government engaged in and tolerated religious freedom violations before and after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down on February 11, 2001,"" the commissioners wrote in the report. They cited violence toward religious minorities in Egypt including Coptic Christians and non-majority Muslim groups. ""Since February 11, religious freedom conditions have not improved and attacks targeting religious minorities have continued,"" the report said. The group said Egypt was put on the list of ""Countries of Particular Concern"" for ""a number of very specific reasons but one that was a particular concern to the commissioners was the issue of impunity,"" commission chair Leonard Leo told reporters at a Washington news conference about the report. One benchmark the commission looked at for Egypt, Leo said, was the trial following the Naga Hammadi shootings, which involved a massacre on the day Coptic Christians celebrate their Christmas Eve services. ""That, for us, was a very important signal the impunity issue was getting worse and not better. When you combine that with other conditions that have existed, particularly various elements of state sponsored repression, we believe there was sufficient grounds for triggering the (International Religious Freedom) act standard, which is a systematic, egregious violations of the freedom of religion,"" Leo said. Elizabeth Prodromou, a vice-chair of the commission, said the group noted ""both a qualitative, as well as a quantitative, deterioration in religious freedom issues in Egypt."" ""In particular, we saw a dramatic uptick in targeted religious violence, primarily against the Coptic Orthodox community, but also against the Roman Catholic community and other Christian communities,"" she said. The commission recommended that the U.S. military direct some of the ""existing military assistance"" to protecting Coptic Christians and other religious minorities, in addition to diplomatic efforts to pressure the new government with reform measures.

"(CNN) -- Nasser Al-Attiyah has called time on the defense of his Dakar Rally title, pulling out of the 2012 race after problems with his car. The Qatari quit the annual race across South America after his temperamental Hummer broke down on the ninth stage between Antofagasta and Iquique in Chile. Al-Attiyah has endured a litany of problems with his vehicle since the start of the race on New Year's Day and threw in the towel after 174km of the ninth stage having made three unscheduled stops. American Bobby Gordon didn't have any such problems as he claimed his first stage win in the 2012 race to further close the gap on overall leader Stephane Peterhansel. Gordon cuts Peterhansel's lead in stage eight . The Frenchman -- a six-time motorbike and three-time car champion in the Dakar -- finished a minute and 38 seconds behind Gordon, with Spain's Nani Roma third. With four days remaining in the race Gordon, a NASCAR veteran, trails Peterhansel by nearly six minutes in the overall standings. He said: ""We had a couple of big scary moments. For us, we've got to make time. We're in a different position to him (Peterhansel). He has to conserve his time and I've got to make it. ""We've got four days left, four real days of racing left and the Hummer's strong. I can't believe he could catch us there, because we were going crazy. So he's a madman; if he beats us, he's a madman. Madder than me!"" In the motorbike classification, Cyril Despres won stage nine to return to the top of the overall standings in his seesaw battle with Spain's Mark Como. The Frenchman, who got stuck in a patch of mud for ten minutes during stage eight, bounced back to triumph in the 606km stretch with Como coming in second. Despres now leads Como by two minutes 28 seconds in the overall standings. He told the Dakar Rally's official website: ""After a difficult day yesterday when you start to doubt, I had to get back to winning ways. ""It's very competitive. Like any top level sportsman, if you don't like confrontation or squeezing the last ounces of strength out of yourself, then you're not ready for a fight. But, as for me, I'm up for it.""","Nasser Al-Attiyah pulls out of the 2012 Dakar Rally with car trouble .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy says he's not listening to any of his critics in the buildup to the Masters, as the world No. 2 reflects on his troubled start to 2013. The Northern Irishman missed the cut at January's Abu Dhabi Golf Championship after announcing a deal with sponsor Nike which could see him earn as much as $250 million. McIlroy followed that by walking off the course at the Honda Classic a month ago before apologizing, having struggled to produce his best golf with a new set of clubs. That stuttering start to the season prompted the 23-year-old to change his schedule -- pulling out of a charity event -- to unexpectedly play this week in the Valero Texas Open, citing the need for more practice ahead of the year's first major at Augusta. ""No one knows what I'm trying to do more than me,"" he told CNN's Living Golf in an exclusive interview. ""There was a lot of hype at the start of the year obviously with the switch to Nike, coming off the back of such a great year last year. It's nice now everything's settled down a bit. ""I know what I'm doing. And I know what I'm working on the course. Of course you see some things sometimes, but you try just to block it out and try, I guess, to have faith in what you're doing."" McIlroy was intending to be in Haiti this week as part of his role as a UNICEF ambassador, but the two-time major winner took the advice of his caddy J.P. Fitzgerald and traveled to San Antonio to play more competitive golf ahead of the Masters. ""I decided after my second round in Houston last week,"" explained McIlroy. Blog: Putting key to Tiger's revival . ""My caddy mentioned it to me and I took a moment to think about it. And I thought it was the best thing to get ready for the Masters."" McIlroy's play was patchy at Houston, and he laughed as he recalls hitting the ball in the water 10 times. But he was also the longest driver in the PGA Tour tournament, and the seventh best putter. He finished tied for 45th, 12 shots adrift of winner D.A. Points. Resurgent Woods . McIlroy, who won the 2011 U.S. Open and the 2012 PGA Championship, readily admits such play will not be good enough to prosper this year -- especially given the form of a certain player who has just knocked him off the top of the world rankings. ""Tiger's played great golf this year,"" said McIlroy of his new Nike stablemate and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods. ""It was coming. You could see last year he was getting very close. He won three times last year as well. ""He's been putting very well, which is a big key, and if he putts like that for the rest of the season he's going to be very difficult to beat."" After Texas, for which McIlroy made the deadline to enter by just half an hour, he heads to Augusta -- where he will seek to win his first coveted green jacket. At the 2011 Masters, McIlroy missed out on the first major win of his career as he threw away a four-shot lead in the fourth and final round. ""It's still the same,"" he said. ""It might not be quite the same as the first time I went down but you still get a special feeling, a special excitement when you drive down Magnolia Lane. It's just a different atmosphere to anything in golf."" His excitement will be more than matched by golf fans should the Masters turn into a showdown between McIlroy and a resurgent Woods.","Rory McIlroy is paying no attention to his critics heading into the Masters .

"(CNN) -- Rebels in the Central African Republic -- who took over numerous towns and threatened to overrun the capital -- will be part of a unity government under that nation's embattled president, a government spokesman said Friday. The apparent deal would appear to end violence that began last month, when the Seleka rebel coalition launched an offensive as they demanded President Francois Bozize step down after accusing him of reneging on a peace deal. As the insurgency advanced in the nation's north and neared the capital of Bangui, Bozize urged the international community, including the United States and France, to help fend off the rebellion. He also engaged in peace negotiations, including those this week involving the Seleka and opposition party leaders in Gabon's capital, Libreville. These talks ended Friday with an agreement to form a ""government of national unity"" headed by Bozize, said Jules Gauthier Ngbapo, a spokesman for the Central African Republic's decentralization and territorial administration ministry. ""Seleka rebels and ... opposition (party) leaders agreed to select the prime minister,"" said Ngbapo, who added that there will be new legislative elections in a year. Bozize, the soon-to-be named prime minister and Cabinet members cannot run in the next election, said Margaret Vogt, a special representative of the U.N. secretary-general. The rebels want 400 South African troops deployed to the Central African Republic to ""withdraw progressively,"" Ngbapo said. South African President Jacob Zuma announced Sunday that his nation's troops would ""assist with capacity building"" of the Central African Republic's military, which was then fighting a still vibrant insurgency. The new government and the other changes were expected imminently. A cease-fire -- expanding on one that Ngbapo, earlier Friday, said would be in effect for a week -- goes into effect ""within 72 hours"" of the parties signing the deal, said Vogt. ""We are hopeful that the agreements that have been signed today in Libreville will contain the immediate flare-up and will calm the situation ... and enable us to recalibrate the disarmament process,"" Vogt said from New York, where the United Nations is based. At the same time, the U.N. official warned the lack of introspection -- and corrective action -- regarding why past agreements weren't fully implemented ""may lead to another meltdown a few years down the line."" This sentiment was echoed by the office of European Union foreign affairs representative Catherine Ashton. ""Such an agreement is the first step out of the crisis,"" Ashton's office said. ""To be sustainable, the normalization and stabilization of the country in the longer term requires the underlying causes of the outbreak of recurrent conflicts in the Central African Republic to be addressed in a consensual way by all stakeholders."" The deal comes after fits and starts in the peace process in recent weeks, which were marked by fighting interspersed by indications both sides were open to dialogue. For instance, Ngbapo said rebel fighters attacked two towns last Saturday -- a few days before their leaders were set to join Bozize, as well as the presidents of Gabon, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea and the Republic of Congo, in Libreville. CNN was unable to confirm government claims about the occupation of the towns. As the government scrambled to put down the rebellion, UNICEF representative Souleymane Diabate said ""reliable sources"" had told his U.N. agency ""that children are newly being recruited"" by rebel groups and pro-government militias. Armed groups were forcing people younger than 18 to fight, carry supplies and serve as sex slaves, the agency said last Friday. About 300,000 children have been affected by the rebellion, including family separation, sexual violence, displacement and lack of access to education and health facilities, the agency said. CNN's Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Central African Republic rebels launched an offensive last month, upset at their president .

"(CNN) -- It's a question most of us seem to have pondered at some point: When should stores start on the Christmas season? For one Canadian drugstore chain, the first week in November is too soon, at least for the sounds of the season. Shoppers Drug Mart pulled Christmas music from its almost 1,200 stores across Canada at midnight Friday after hearing complaints from customers that they weren't quite ready for the season to be jolly. ""Hi everyone, due to recent complaints around the Christmas music being played in stores we want to advise you that as of midnight EST tonight, all Christmas music will be suspended until further notice. We do take customer feedback to heart, and it does lead to change,"" the chain announced on its Facebook page. Read more: When spouses clash over Christmas . The posting has drawn more than 7,300 ""likes"" and almost 6,000 comments as of Monday morning, the majority of them positive. ""I'm so pleased with Shoppers' decision,"" writes Nathalie Prezeau. ""I wanted time to digest my Halloween candies before starting to think about the plum pudding."" Some customers said they'll give Shoppers Drug Mart more of their business. ""This is awesome. Christmas has been rammed down consumer's throats earlier and earlier each year. I will be shopping at your store more often to avoid it!"" wrote Lori Anne Stoute. James MacFarlane said Christmas music in stores makes him fell ""like being trapped in an endless jukebox."" ""Thank you!"" MacFarlane wrote. ""It turns me off of even going into stores over the holiday season knowing it's endless Christmas music everywhere. Having two months of it is insane."" Read more: 5 great European cities for Christmas markets . The sanity of the chain's employees was on the minds of some who commented. Wayne Gerand Martin said hearing the sounds of the season eight hours a day ""would drive me nuts. It would take the Christmas spirit out of the employees."" ""Your employees probably are thanking you too -- having to listen to Christmas music for 2 months is just too long,"" wrote Janet Williams. But not everyone is happy with the delay of the Christmas music. ""This is silly to stop Christmas music. The Christmas season is way too short and it stops immediately after Christmas. Play on,"" wrote Kathryn Lawlor Haynes Gibson. Another took her dissent a bit further. ""What a disappointment to take something so joyful and degrade it with negativity,"" wrote Trisha Trudell. ""Take the commercialism aside, Christmas is the most wonderful time of year to show love and equality and be giving and kind. What's so wrong with sharing in this early."" So guess who won't be getting Trudell's holiday business this year, or any year? ""Depending on how (S)hoppers handles this situation going forward will determine if I will ever continue to shop at shoppers drug mart again,"" she wrote. One customer said more power to Trudell and those like her. ""Go ahead and boycott the company, though. Shorter line ups AND not having to deal with Christmas music 7 freaking weeks before the day,.... BONUS!!!"" Cassandra Nadeau wrote. So when is the right time for Christmas music in stores? Many of those commenting on Facebook said retailers should wait until after Remembrance Day, Canada's equivalent of Veterans Day in the U.S., which Canada will mark on November 11 or 12, depending on the province. ""The Respect for those Veterans during Veteran's week and Remembrance day should not have to be in competition with Rudolph and Frosty,"" wrote Tanya Murray. While the chain is not giving a definitive date when Christmas music will return, it's certainly not forsaking the season. Check the chain's website and the first thing you'll see is an offer to sign up to win a $2,000 holiday shopping spree. Offer expires December 3. Plenty of time to shop before Christmas.","When should stores start on the Christmas season?

"(CNN) -- Kenyan legislators voted to give themselves send-off bonuses of $110,000 each, despite the president's veto of their earlier attempt at another hefty payoff. Members of parliament approved the retirement package in a late-night vote this week, this time adding extra perks such as diplomatic passports, a state funeral and VIP access to the nation's airports. In addition to their perks, they included a bonus for President Mwai Kibaki, who is not running for re-election in March. Read more: Kenyan DJs go six days without food to promote peaceful elections . Kibaki blocked their earlier attempt to award themselves bonuses in October, calling it unconstitutional and unaffordable. The nation's parliament members are among the highest paid on the continent. An average Kenyan makes about $1,800 annually, and would have to work for more than 60 years to earn the bonus amount. The proposal has sparked an outcry among citizens, who demanded that the president block the bill's passage. ""I'm disgusted,"" said Warothe Kiru, a blogger who lives in the capital of Nairobi. ""They really don't care. The thing that's making it worse is what's happening in Tana,"" he said. In the same news reports about women being attacked with machetes, ""you're seeing ... MPs getting bonuses."" In recent months, retaliatory attacks between rival tribes have raged in Tana River District, leaving more than 100 people dead. Read more: Renewed violence kills 19 in southeast Kenya . Protesters plan to take to the streets Wednesday to demand that the president veto the bonus bill -- again. In October, when the first bill passed in another late-night vote, throngs gathered outside parliament offices and hollered ""thieves"" as lawmakers dashed into their offices. The president vetoed that bill hours after the protests. Read more: Kenyan lawmakers vote for bonus of $120,000 each at taxpayer expense .

"(CNN) -- Under the baking hot skies of the Persian Gulf the region's travel hubs are showing they're not just places to change planes -- they're destinations in their own right. The Gulf's ""Big Three"" carriers -- Dubai-based Emirates, Abu Dhabi's Etihad, and Doha-based Qatar Airways -- have grown dramatically over the last decade, opening new routes and competing with the biggest names in aviation. Conveniently placed between east and west, the Gulf's geographic location has been a major factor in these industry-reshaping developments. Anywhere in the world is one stop from the Gulf. Add to this the investment in state-of-the-art airports and vast new plane fleets, as well as the acquisition of stakes in some of Europe's biggest airlines which have ruptured traditional airline alliances, and it is clear why more and more commercial traffic is making a pit-stop in the region. Watch video: 'Gulf Three' shake up global aviation . But the ""Big Three"" are keen to stress that Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Dubai are more than just strategically located landing strips in the desert. Each is a thriving commercial and cultural destination with plenty to offer travelers passing through the region. Dubai . Literally built out of the sand, Dubai set out on its meteoric rise into the global community in the early 1970s. In just three decades it grew from a humble fishing and trading dock into a world-renowned tax-free business haven. With artificial islands, gaudy luxury hotels and colossal skyscrapers, modern Dubai is nothing if not spectacular. And according to Emirates president Tim Clarke, Dubai is more than just a transfer hub. ""Dubai is such a great place to live and work, have your family, have education, health, etc. The lifestyle is very good,"" Clarke told CNN's Richard Quest. ""Remember, we have nearly 80,000 hotel rooms here, which is a lot more than most large cities in the world today,"" he added. Watch video: Emirates shakes up aviation industry . Top attraction: Any traveler will struggle to miss the world's largest building, the Burj Khalifa, which is more than 2,700 feet tall and offers the perfect vantage point to view the city's ever expanding skyline. Where to stay: Dubai may have a huge number of hotels but few are more impressive than the sail-shaped Burj Al Arab, which offers jacuzzis in every suite, an army of trained butlers and guest access to a fleet of chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce cars. Abu Dhabi . Like Dubai, downtown Abu Dhabi has its fair share of large mirror-and-glass buildings that stretch high into the sky. Unlike its upstart neighbor, however, the emirate is eager to emphasize its cultural and traditional heritage alongside its shiny modern facade. A number of important Islamic and historical sites are dotted across Abu Dhabi, whilst plans are in place to open branches of major museums such as the Louvre and Guggenheim by 2017. See also: The desert gem stepping out of Dubai's shadow . Top attraction: The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is one of the biggest in the world. Spread over 22,000 square meters it can accommodate a staggering 41,000 worshipers. Abu Dhabi's close proximity to the desert means even short-stay travelers can take a trip out onto its sun-drenched dunes. Where to stay: Built in 2005, the Emirates Palace Hotel is located on a private beach. Despite its youth, the 114 domes that grace the opulent hotel evoke traditional Arabian architecture. Doha . Unlike Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the Qatari capital of Doha has less experience when it comes to welcoming foreign tourists and travelers. This situation will change dramatically in the coming years as the tiny nation prepares to host the football extravaganza of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A detailed plan is already in place to develop tourism in Qatar, although the CEO of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, is keen for the country to maintain its cultural integrity. ""We don't want to be a mass-tourism destination, we want to be very selective,"" he told Quest. ""We have a lot of culture in this country, the people's mindset is different. We want to respect that mindset ... and grow our tourism in a way that does not dispute the cultural fabric of my country."" Watch video: A new chapter for Qatar Airways?

"(CNN) -- How did Shannon Reynolds make it through several layers of security unquestioned and end up on the tarmac at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport? That's what Delta Air Lines, the Transportation Security Administration and the Atlanta Police Department are trying to figure out. Around 5 a.m. on February 23, Reynolds was simply trying to park at an off-site parking lot in time to catch a flight on Spirit Airlines, she told CNN. She didn't notice she was pulling into a Delta employee parking lot, where she said she was waved through two security checkpoints and allowed to park. Wearing a sundress and carrying her suitcase, she got on a Delta employee shuttle without being asked for identification. None of the employees on board was wearing a uniform, she said, so she said she didn't realize it was for employees only. ""When I got to the airport, I looked around and I realized this is not where I was supposed to be. It was the tarmac with a big airplane sitting there,"" Reynolds said. Reynolds alerted the shuttle driver, but she was still allowed to get out of the bus onto the tarmac. A ramp agent used his badge to take her up the stairs into the airport passenger area. ""Here I was sitting in the middle of the C Terminal without having to go through security or do anything,"" Reynolds said. The airport employee who let her into the secure area told her to go downstairs and go through security as she normally would, Reynolds said. Inside the terminal someone finally stopped her and asked for her identification. That started the investigation into how she had made it so far without being checked. (In a police report on the incident, the ramp agent she followed into the concourse said he assumed she was an employee because of all the checkpoints she had to pass.) ""Airports are responsible for implementing security programs that restrict access to secure areas,"" said TSA spokesman David Castelveter in a statement. ""TSA is conducting an investigation to determine how an individual without proper credentials accessed the secure area of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport via an airline employee parking lot."" Delta is re-emphasizing the checking of employee identification at Delta employee parking lots, according to the airline. ""We have taken aggressive action with our security vendors at the parking lot to emphasize that all security procedures, especially verification of credentials, are strictly adhered to,"" said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant in a statement. The police report states that Reynolds ""was transported back to her vehicle and allowed to move her car"" from the parking lot, noting that the delay caused her to miss her 6:30 a.m. flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, then on to Costa Rica. Reynolds told CNN she was able to catch a later flight to Costa Rica, from where she recently returned.","A traveler trying to make an early-morning flight accidentally parked in a Delta employee lot .

"(CNN) -- A woman watching the Dakar Rally in Argentina died Saturday after a vehicle in the event went off the track, striking her and other fans, race organizers said. Sonia Natalia Gallardo died Saturday afternoon at a hospital in Cordoba, Argentina, race organizers said in a statement on the event's Web site. The others who were hit were being treated for ""slight injuries,"" the statement said. The incident, which involved German driver Mirco Schultis and Swiss partner Ulrich Leardi, occurred in the race's first stage, from Buenos Aires to Cordoba, the organizers said. Schultis and Leardi were driving in a 4x4 Desert Warrior truck, according to the Web site. Tomas Fragueiro, a photojournalist with Argentina's La Voz del Interior, witnessed the accident and told CNN that he helped police and medical teams take care of the victims. ""I was in the internal zone of the 30-kilometer curve where most reporters were standing,"" said Fragueiro in a telephone interview. ""Security did not include the security tapes required in most races and [Gallardo] was standing outside a safety zone,"" he said. Race officials offered their condolences to the victim's family and called for organizers and authorities to ""exercise the greatest care and keep within special 'spectator zones.' "" Established in 1978, the Dakar race is an intrepid, off-the-beaten-path rally that involves modified vehicles. Known for its strenuous itineraries, the race first took place from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal, and later moved to other regions of the world. This year's Dakar race is in South America for the first time. The race spans from Argentina to Chile from January 1 to 17.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida man who admitted to the near-fatal beating of his two-year-old son while teaching him how to box remained behind bars Thursday, facing felony charges. Lee Willie Dejesus, 23, of Homestead, appeared in court Wednesday night wearing a green protective vest reserved for those on suicide watch, reported CNN affiliate WFOR. A judge denied him bail. Dejesus' son was on life support Thursday, said Ed Griffith, spokesman for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office. Griffith said it was his understanding that the child was being kept on life support so his organs could be donated. Dejesus is charged with aggravated child abuse with great harm, a first-degree felony, and aggravated child neglect with great harm, a second-degree felony. Griffith said once prosecutors are notified the child has been taken off life support and pronounced dead, they are poised to file first-degree murder charges against Dejesus. Miami-Dade police said Dejesus was watching the child while his mother was at work Monday night. He told police that he put on boxing gloves and struck the child about 15 times on his face, head, torso and shoulders over a period of 15 minutes, punching him so hard at one point that the boy fell off the bed and struck his head on the tile floor. The child was rushed to Children's Hospital where he underwent surgery for bleeding on the brain. A criminal complaint alleges that Dejesus waited to call for medical help for as long as an hour after the boy became unresponsive. He eventually called 911 after the boy's lips became blue, according to the complaint. Dejesus initially told police that the boy was beaten by a babysitter before admitting he was responsible, the complaint says.

"(CNN) -- Stephane Peterhansel has clinched a remarkable 10th Dakar Rally victory after safely finishing Sunday's 29km special stage to the Peruvian capital Lima. The Frenchman only had to avoid mechanical trouble to seal his fourth car triumph, having also won the race six times in the motorcycle category. And the Mini driver achieved that aim, coming home 10th on the day, three minutes and 12 seconds behind stage winner Robby Gordon in his Hummer. Does Dakar Rally damage a delicate environment? That result ensured Peterhansel covered the 8,400km-long race from Mar Del Plata in Argentina in a combined time of 38 hours, 54 minutes and 46 seconds. Team-mate Nani Roma was 41:56 back in second place with South African Toyota driver Ginel De Villiers third at 1.13:25. Peterhansel told the official Dakar website: ""When you think how hard it is to win a Dakar Rally, it's incredible that I have been able to win 10 of them. ""It's been a long time, I've been waiting for five years to win again! To take the victory in South America is a huge relief, it ranks among my best triumphs."" He added: ""My finest victory will always be my first win in the motorcycle category, but this one has something special to it. ""I was starting to doubt myself, to think I was growing too old for this, that I'd lost it or that I wasn't made for South America -- and in the end everything turned out fine!"" Meanwhile, it proved a French double delight with Cyril Despres claiming the motorcycle category after also completing the final stage unscathed. Despres was presented victory on Saturday when rival Marc Coma took a wrong turn and he cemented his fourth title after the final stage was won by Dutchman Pal Ullevalseter. The KTM rider came home 53:20 ahead of Coma, with Yamaha rider Helder Rodrigues of Portugal in third place at 1.11:17. Despres said: ""I always pay attention to detail. I like doing my homework and, in my job, when things go OK you end up winning. ""This is without doubt the toughest Dakar I've ever raced in. All victories are beautiful, but this one is special because it came down to the wire and was decided at the last minute."" He continued: ""I've done 85 or 90 rallies throughout my life, and this one was the one where I had to fight the hardest. Today will leave its mark on me.""","Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel wins the Dakar Rally, his 10th success in the race .

"(CNN) -- The mother of ""Modern Family"" star Ariel Winter is denying allegations that she abused the 14-year-old actress. ""It's all untrue, it's all untrue,"" Chris Workman told People about allegations in a court document relating to guardianship of Winter. Winter, whose real name is Ariel W. Workman, stars as Alex Dunphy in the ABC comedy series. Last month, a Los Angeles judge ordered the young actress be placed in temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. ""It's most unfortunate that the matter has become an interest of the press,"" said Michael Kretzmer, Gray's attorney. ""Ariel's best interest is what we're concerned about, and that's what we'll work for in future court proceedings."" Kretzmer declined to offer further details about the case. The lawyer filed a petition on behalf of Gray on October 3, alleging Winter was the victim of ongoing physical abuse, insults about her weight, deprivation of food and attempts to ""sexualize"" a minor. Guardianship with Gray was necessary to protect Winter from further abuse, Kretzmer said in the document. A judge ruled that Chris Workman have no contact with Winter until a November 20 hearing on the matter. CNN was unable to reach Chris Workman for comment Thursday. But the mother told People, ""I have my doctor's letter that my daughter's never been abused. ... I have stylists' letters that she's never been abused."" ABC and personal representatives for Winter declined to comment. Kretzmer also contended in the court document that guardianship was necessary because Chris Workman receives checks for Winter's work on ""Modern Family"" and has control of a related financial account. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Young actress on ""Modern Family"" is under temporary guardianship .

"(Rolling Stone) -- The digital archivist who restored the singles catalogs of the Smiths, Joy Division and New Order in a series of blog projects is being strongly discouraged from starting a similar project collecting R.E.M.'s earliest work. In a blog post on the nascent R.E.M.cycle site, the blogger known as Analog Loyalist explained that Universal, the record company that owns the band's IRS Records catalog, issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice for an R.E.M. post on the writer's sister site The Power of Independent Trucking featuring a restored version of the band's first cassette demo, with early renditions of ""Radio Free Europe,"" ""Sitting Still"" and ""White Tornado."" ""Tell me, what role does the IFPI (of which Universal is obviously a member) have to do with unreleased material recorded when the band had no record contract?,"" Analog Loyalist writes, referring to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. ""These were demos freely given away by the band. On low-fi C45 cassettes. And the IFPI thinks it's their business how?"" The blogger is now reconsidering the wisdom of pursuing the project. ""So you can see why I'm very hesitant to move forward with this blog, only because I don't want to see my efforts as a writer/archivist/engineer wasted,"" he writes. The site would in fact be a very labor-intensive process. As explained in the sidebar for the R.E.M., Smiths and Joy Division/New Order sites, the tracks used are ""taken from the best/earliest possible sources to avoid modern mastering techniques which crush the dynamics,"" and the artwork is ""scanned at the highest possible resolution and the type was reset when possible using the original fonts."" All works featured in these projects are from out-of-print sources, and some tracks have never been commercially released or reissued. See the full story at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- My kids -- 4, 6 and 8 -- love the movie ""Wreck It Ralph."" It's about a video game character that desperately wants to win a medal. Meanwhile, at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is reviewing a new policy that awards medals to drone operators who might think they're in a video game. Predatory drones have changed the art of war. As to the question of whether it's been a change for the good or the bad, that coin is still in the air. This much we know: This is not your father's brand of warfare. That was more up-close and personal. When your dad served in Vietnam -- let alone, when your grandfather fought in World War II -- they took the fight to the enemy, and they had to step into the theater of war to do it. Soldiers exchanged gunfire. Sometimes, they even engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Fighter pilots were shot down. Those captured by the enemy became prisoners of war. And in recognition of such acts of valor, the military gives out medals -- the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Silver Star and Medal of Honor. That's how it has always worked. In defense of your country, you put yourself at risk of death or at least great personal harm. And your country shows its gratitude by giving you a medal. When you receive this kind of commendation, you are assured that your service has been exemplary and your sacrifice significant. Now things are different. Oh, the military still awards plenty of the traditional medals -- the old school way. Yet under a policy approved by Hagel's predecessor, Leon Panetta, on his way out the door, military officials are also preparing to offer something called ""The Distinguished Warfare Medal."" It recognizes ""extraordinary direct impacts on combat operations."" But -- and here's the important part -- it has no ""geographic limitation."" So if you kill an insurgent in Afghanistan, you don't really have to be physically present in Afghanistan. You don't even have to be in that part of the world. You can be sipping coffee and checking your e-mail thousands of miles away in a control room in Virginia. You press a few buttons and eliminate a few people. Then, at the end of your shift, you wrap up and drive to your kid's soccer game. It's all in a day's work. When it was announced that drone operators would now be eligible for medals, lawmakers and veterans groups raised concerns that the medal would eclipse those typically given for bravery in battle. They don't want the medal scrapped. They just want it downgraded and put in its proper place in the pecking order. Those objections are fair. But concerns like that are not likely to resonate with most Americans who -- let's face it -- can't tell one medal from another. Critics are right to be angry. But they're upset about the wrong thing. These special medals are really a bad idea, and the reasons for that have less to do with the pecking order among medals and more to do with the detached way that drone operators carry out their remote-control missions. First, these high-tech cowboys are never in harm's way. You simply can't compare what they do from behind a desk with what others do on the battlefield. Second, the whole concept is morbid. We know that innocent civilians have died in drone strikes in Pakistan. Sooner or later, the criteria for this medal may become: ""How many kills do you have?"" The more kills, the more likely you are to get a medal. Lastly, handing out rewards and incentives for drone strikes only reinforces the fantasy of war as a video game, where you do well when you advance. We have enough of that already among a young generation of soldiers that grew up playing video games. We shouldn't encourage more of it. Pentagon officials are expected, in the next month, to decide the fate of the medal for drone operators. Heading up the review will be Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. He could make the award less prestigious, raise the qualifications, do away with it or just leave things the way they are. Here's the way forward. Dempsey shouldn't bother downgrading the medal, so the other medals don't get jealous. He should just recommend that it be scrapped altogether. While there are those who want to turn war into a video game, someone needs to have the decency to pull the plug. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","A policy is under review that would make it feasible to award medals to drone operators .

"(CNN) -- Fending off elimination for the third straight game, the San Francisco Giants thrashed the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night to earn the right to battle for their second World Series title in three years. The Giants beat the Cardinals 9-0 Monday in a game that lacked the drama of some of the other games during the highly competitive series. San Francisco had been on the brink since last Thursday, when St. Louis jumped to a three games to one advantage in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series. But San Francisco has been on a roll since -- beating the Cardinals twice by five-run margins, before finishing off the reigning champs in convincing fashion Monday at AT&T Park, the northern California team's home. With the victory, the Giants earned the right to face the Detroit Tigers in the World Series, which begins Wednesday. The Tigers handily swept the New York Yankees last week to become American League titlists and earn their shot at baseball's top prize. On Monday night, San Francisco used the same formula that's worked for them so well in recent days: timely hitting and exceptional pitching. Matt Cain was stellar on the mound, pitching 5 and 2/3 scoreless innings to start the game. He even helped his cause at the plate with a run-scoring single in the second inning. The next frame, the Giants exploded for five runs to build a comfortable 7-0 lead. They never looked back, fending off a St. Louis rally in the sixth inning and tacking on more runs in the seventh and eighth innings. Monday's win also marked the second furious comeback the Giants had completed during the postseason. The team was able to come back from a 2-0 deficit and win a best-of-five series against the Cincinati Reds earlier in the playoffs. ""They didn't want to go home. They kept believing,"" said Giants manager Bruce Bochy . Giants catcher Buster Posey said it is the team's attitude that helps them beat the odds. ""It is a lot of want and a lot of will power,"" Posey told reporters. ""You have to believe you can do it."" The Giants easily finished the regular season atop the National League West with a 94-68 record, tied with Atlanta for fourth best in the league. Detroit, meanwhile, had an 88-74 mark in pulling past the Chicago White Sox in the final month to earn a ticket to the playoffs. That said, while their record is inferior, the Tigers feature two of the biggest weapons in baseball in pitcher and 2011 American League MVP Justin Verlander and this year's Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera.","St. Louis led the National League series 3-1 just a few days ago .

"(CNN) -- Do you want to understand why President Obama is visiting Israel so early in his second term? Think of two words: Management and legacy. And they go together. Right now in the cruel and unforgiving foreign policy world in which America is trapped, Barack Obama stands to be the American president on whose watch two catastrophes loom: Bomb Iran or see Iran with a bomb, and the demise of the two-state solution. Israel figures centrally in both issues. If the president is to manage these issues effectively, he needs to find a way to work with Benjamin Netanyahu and the new Israeli government. That effort begins this week. Since the state of Israel was created in 1948, only four American presidents have visited the country while in office (Nixon, Carter, Clinton and Bush 43). And only one -- Jimmy Carter -- achieved a truly significant result by brokering the terms of an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty that was signed at the White House in March 1979. So a visit by an American president can be important; but it is rare. The logic behind Obama's visit, however, is not to hammer out immediate results or to achieve a breakthrough in a box. Obama is already an historic president -- but he is not yet a great one. If he were to achieve that status, it would probably be through big pieces of domestic agenda such as health care, immigration reform, gun control, and of course, economic recovery. He's unlikely to get there by chasing windmills abroad like Syria or Israeli-Palestinian peace. Israeli president: No doubt Obama has Israel's back . Still, he can't forget about the world, least of all the broken, angry and dysfunctional Middle East that could cause him more headaches and undermine his domestic agendas if left unattended. The Iranian nuclear issue could rattle regional stability, send markets plunging and oil prices rising. Obama needs a new approach. Trying to repair his relationship with Netanyahu is smart politics. If the president wants to regain control of the House in 2014 and take an issue away from the Republicans in the process, he needs to remove the image that somehow he's against Netanyahu and doesn't care emotionally about Israel. An early trip to Israel that allows him a chance to connect is just what the doctor ordered. The president spent most of his first term unsure of whether to pander to Bibi or pressure him. Now, he can test to see if he and Netanyahu can get on the same page. Will it work? Israel, of course, isn't the only actor in these stories. There are Iranians and Palestinians, too. But working with Netanyahu may give the president the time he needs to pursue diplomacy with Iran and perhaps a deal with the Palestinians. The Israeli election has weakened Netanyahu and brought in new coalition partners who may well want to improve relations with a U.S. president. Netanyahu knows that his political career can't last forever. At the moment, he's being challenged by two newcomers -- Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett. Both are remarkably popular. Netanyahu's best chance in regaining momentum is to shift the conversations to Iran and foreign policy where he's strongest. And for this, paradoxically, he needs Obama's help. The U.S., Israel and the art of relationship maintenance . Moreover, next year Netanyahu will have served longer than any other prime minister in Israel's history. He may be thinking about his legacy and avoiding the charge that he was a do-nothing leader. Again, the U.S. is the key; and Bibi can't afford to alienate Obama. What makes all of this potentially realistic -- and not a fantasy -- is that the deals on the table are not transformational ones where weak and constrained leaders need to push for impossible goals or make decisions beyond their capacities. No grand bargains or conflict-ending agreements are possible now with the mullahs or between Israelis and Palestinians. There's not enough confidence, too little trust, too much domestic politics and too many gaps on the big issues. But smaller deals may be possible. For example, the two leaders can pursue an interim approach that caps Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief which would give Iran and the international community a way out of the current choices -- bomb or allow Teheran to get the bomb. On the Palestinian issue, the Israelis and Palestinians can quietly explore with the U.S. and with one another how much common ground they may have on the core final status issues while trying to improve the interim situation through security cooperation, loosening up of economic restrictions, and international support for Palestinian institutions. Israeli minister says she hopes U.S. helps restart peace talks . None of these strategies are perfect, but they are starters. And so smartly and rightly, President Obama is going to Israel early (when there are no expectations) and with a view toward giving himself time to reshape his relationship with Netanyahu, building one with the Israeli public, and testing the proposition that he can try to develop some consensus in Israel. Fighting off and on over the past four years clearly hasn't worked. Maybe trying to cooperate over the next four just might. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","President Obama is visiting Israel, will meet with Benjamin Netanyahu .
Aaron David Miller: Obama's attempt to repair relationship with Netanyahu is smart .
He says Netanyahu is mindful of his legacy to avoid being seen as a do-nothing leader .

"(CNN) -- Football Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld suspensions for four current and former New Orleans Saints players accused of taking part in a three-year ""bounty"" program, but he reduced the terms for two former team members, the NFL announced Tuesday. Former Saints defensive lineman Scott Fujita's three-game suspension was cut to one game, while the eight-game penalty given to Anthony Hargrove was cut to seven. But the two who remain with the Saints -- Will Smith and Jonathan Vilma -- saw no change to their suspensions, the league announced. NFL officials have concluded all four helped lead a program that offered bonuses to Saints players who inflicted injuries on opponents over a three-year period. Goodell found the program ""represented conduct detrimental to the league and professional football."" ""Our investigation disclosed nearly two dozen players who either contributed to, or received money from, the pool operated by the Saints' defense. The four disciplined players either were involved in specific bounties on an opposing player, contributed substantially to the bounty program, engaged in payments that violated League rules or were untruthful when the program was initially investigated,"" Goodell said. Louisiana police: No state laws broken in New Orleans Saints wiretapping case . The NFL already has penalized the Saints and members of its coaching staff of the program, which operated from 2009-2011. The NFL Players Association, the player's union, said it would ""thoroughly"" review Goodell's decision ""and review all options to protect our players' rights with vigilance."" ""For more than six months, the NFL has ignored the facts, abused the process outlined in our collective bargaining agreement and failed to produce evidence that the players intended to injure anyone, ever. The only evidence that exists is the League's gross violation of fair due process, transparency and impartiality during this process."" But in letters to the players, parts of which were released by the NFL, Goodell wrote that he believes all four deserved suspensions. Vilma, a Saints defensive captain, drew the longest suspension of the four. He was ordered to sit out a full season and is currently on the Saints' injured reserve list. In a letter announcing his decision, Goodell said he's convinced Vilma pledged $10,000 to any teammate who could hurt then-Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre ""to an extent that he would not be able to continue playing"" in the 2009 National Conference playoffs. ""I recognize that you and some of your teammates have denied that you made such a pledge or claim not to recall your doing so, but I am persuaded, based on the entirety of the record before me, that you did so,"" Goodell wrote. ""And I find that such a pledge or any similar incentive is conduct detrimental."" Goodell said Smith, who has been on the field for the Saints this season, acknowledged that he approved of the program but denied ""that anyone intended to inflict injury on any opposing player."" NFL commissioner Goodell announces anti-bounty steps . ""Even in the face of repeated appeals to 'crank up the John Deere tractor and cart the guy off,' you and others now claim that the objective was instead merely to 'knock the wind out' of your opponents, requiring them to leave the game for only a play or two,"" he wrote. ""From the standpoint of player safety, fair competition and the integrity of the game, the issues with which I am concerned today, this kind of after-the-fact explanation is little more than wordplay that, in my judgment as Commissioner, offers no basis on which to excuse conduct that does not belong in professional football."" As for Fujita, now with the Cleveland Browns, Goodell said he had no evidence that the player had contributed to the bounty pool, but knew about it and didn't speak out against it. ""Your failure to act contributed to allowing this program to remain in place not only during the 2009 season, but for two additional seasons after that,"" Goodeel wrote. Meanwhile, Hargrove is now a free agent and will be credited with the five regular-season games he has missed so far -- leaving him to sit out two games once he's signed to another team. Goodell wrote that Hargrove tried to mislead investigators and block the NFL probe into the Saints and made several statements that were ""not credible"" during a mid-September meeting. Saints general manager said he did not eavesdrop . CNN's David Close contributed to this report.","NFL commissioner hits four over ""conduct detrimental to the league""

"(CNN) -- The long-running conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has claimed hundreds of sexual violence victims in the past two months as women and girls continue to be prime targets of retaliation between rival militias along the country's porous borders, according to aid agencies. At least 657 cases of sexual violence involving women and girls were documented in September and October during mass expulsions from Angola to Congo, according to UNICEF. UNICEF, which compiled the case information over the past two months with help from aid agencies on both sides of the border, said women, girls and possibly men were sexually victimized as about 6,621 Congolese nationals were expelled from Angola. ""Many cases of VS [sexual violence] are reported, including torture,"" according to a UNICEF document obtained by CNN on Saturday. A UNICEF spokesman in Kinshasa, DRC, said there have been 35 confirmed rapes so far as victims undergo medical evaluations in makeshift shelters set up by international aid organizations. The U.N. plans to send a special mission, comprised of representatives from a variety of aid agencies, to the area next week to talk to community leaders, doctors and humanitarian organizations about the allegations, the spokesman said. The Angolan deportations of more Congolese nationals were announced in August 2001, the report said. These mass-expulsions are making civilians more vulnerable to such attacks, the spokesman said. Relations between the DRC and Angola -- once an ally -- have been strained. More than 10,200 Congolese nationals were deported from Angola in January and February of 2010. Several incidents of human rights abuse and sexual violence were reported associated with these expulsions as well, according to the United Nations. Warring insurgent groups, such as the Ugandan-based Lords Resistance Army (LRA) and the Hutu-backed militia known as FDLR, operating in the eastern DRC are a main source for instability in the region, the agency said. Rape has become a weapon of war in the Congolese conflict. The United Nations has named the Democratic Republic of Congo the ""rape capital of the world,"" with 15,000 women raped in eastern Congo last year. The attacks occurred in parts of the country where armed rebel groups moved into areas considered to be pro-government but lacking in army or police protection, according to the U.N. Often dubbed the Great African war, analysts say the conflict in the DRC -- considered Africa's oldest and deadliest war -- has cost the lives of nearly five million people. Nine African nations were involved in the conflict that spilled over from the 1996 Rwandan genocide. CNN's Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","657 cases of sexual violence and 35 rapes were documented over the past two months .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's lawyer accuses prosecutors of leaking details of her case to TMZ, which he says resulted in ""an inaccurate report"" about where the actress will go for rehab. Mark Heller, who is himself being investigated for alleged witness tampering in Lohan's probation violation case, called for an investigation of the Santa Monica and Los Angeles city attorneys. ""It's horrible, because Lindsay Lohan or any defendant should be able to feel that their privacy is being protected,"" Heller told CNN on Wednesday after TMZ reported Lohan would check into the Seafield Center in Westhampton Beach, New York, for her court-mandated 90 days of substance abuse rehabilitation next month. ""It impacts the integrity of the legal system in California,"" said Heller, a New York lawyer. That information was included in a ""personal and confidential"" e-mail he sent to the two prosecutors, Heller said. ""Since I'm the only one who communicated that, it more or less would have to be that one of the two prosecutors would be their source,"" he said. ""A source tells me it may result in the launch of a major investigation in California to ascertain where all these leaks and breaches of confidentiality are emanating from,"" Heller said. A spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney declined to comment, and the Santa Monica prosecutor was in court and unavailable to respond. ""Think how it impacts the facility, and the people in the facility who go to the facility to get treatment and, lo and behold, 100 paparazzi show up at the front gate and impair the privacy,"" he said. Lohan, 26, was ordered to spend 90 days in rehab as an alternative to 90 days in jail for her ""no contest"" pleas to lying to police about a car crash, reckless driving and violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction. ""It shocks me that I learn about what's going on in this case from the Internet more quickly than I do from the prosecutors,"" Heller said. ""These Internet facilities are running amok, and they are violating rights and they are perverting our judicial system."" ""Lindsay Lohan is the victim,"" he said. ""She should be afforded some sort of privacy."" Santa Monica police are investigating Heller for suspicion of asking Lohan's personal assistant, who was in the car with the actress when she was involved in a car crash last June, to lie in his testimony by saying he had control of the Porsche when it crashed into a dump truck, a source close to the investigation told CNN last month. The Santa Monica city attorney asked the city's police to investigate, according to the source, who asked not to be identified since the source is not authorized to discuss it with news media. ""I can sum it up in one word: ridiculous,"" Heller said when asked for a comment last month. ""What can I tell you?"" Lohan, just ahead of the premiere of ""Scary Movie 5,"" in which she appears with Charlie Sheen, paid a visit to David Letterman's CBS show Tuesday. ""We never thought we'd see you again, honestly, because of the jokes and stuff,"" Letterman told her. ""But you have enough spine, enough sense of yourself, enough poise to come out here and talk to me."" Lohan joked with Letterman about her criminal history, but also got serious about her upcoming rehab stay. ""I think this is an opportunity for me to focus on what I love in life,"" she said. ""I don't think it's a bad thing, I think it's a blessing."" Lohan tears up talking to Letterman .","Mark Heller: TMZ source ""would have to be"" one of the two prosecutors .

"(CNN) -- An unusual exhibition is confusing and amusing tourists and locals in central Copenhagen this month. Strange signs from around the world can be seen in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""Signspotting"" is a collection of more than 100 signs found by travelers around the world and recreated by travel writer Doug Lansky. ""I wanted it to look as if we'd stolen the sign or someone with a professional camera had taken a really good picture of it,"" he told CNN.  See pictures from Signspotting in Copenhagen. » . Lansky started his collection almost 17 years ago, encouraged by friends who found his photos of strange signs more compelling than his treasured holiday snaps. As a travel columnist for the Chicago Tribune, he set about collecting photos of as many bizarre signs as he could. Interest in the project became so big that he eventually used them to replace the column itself. Signspotting Weekly was taken up by six papers, and before he knew it people began to send him pictures of signs they'd seen, eventually enough to fill a floor-to-ceiling cabinet. The photos filled two volumes of Signspotting books for Lonely Planet. Lansky chose the best for the first exhibition in Stockholm last year. ""I felt bad I hadn't seen them. I knew I wasn't going to go around the world to track it down so I thought I'd do it this way,"" he said. Creating the exhibition took hours of painstaking work to digitally enlarge the photos so they looked like the real thing. ""When most of these people sent these signs in they were on a postcard-sized photo and the actual sign was about the size of a postage stamp. To blow them up to this size was tricky,"" he said. The photos were then mounted onto real signs on metal poles standing in concrete bases. The free exhibition opened in Copenhagen, Denmark last week and will move to Arhus, Denmark on July 1st. Lansky is currently building a second exhibition for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August.","Doug Lansky has been collecting photos of amusing signs for 17 years .

"(CNN) -- On October 16, 1962, President John F. Kennedy confirmed the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, thus beginning one of the most dangerous moments in modern history -- the Cuban missile crisis. For the next 13 days, the United States and the Soviet Union would come frighteningly close to all-out nuclear war. Fifty years later, a new interactive multimedia documentary provides viewers with an unflinching look inside the critical event. ""Clouds Over Cuba"" gives audiences a front-row seat to what could have been a catastrophe. Working closely with the John F. Kennedy Library, filmmakers were given unprecedented access to letters, memos, documents and imagery, which viewers can engage with as the documentary plays. Additionally, special real-time alerts can be set up to notify a viewer's mobile devices to mirror the critical events of the 13-day crisis. And, perhaps its boldest feature, the site also offers a terrifying companion film which imagines what might have been, had the worst not been avoided half a century ago. In an interview with CNN, actor Matthew Modine, who narrates the film, explains his involvement with the project, talks about his admiration for Kennedy, and shares what a successful 30-year marriage can teach a man about the delicate art of diplomacy and negotiation. CNN: Let's talk about ""Clouds Over Cuba."" Matthew Modine: OK, so this is an important documentary, because it enlightens a contemporary audience about the events that took place in the White House on the brink of a nuclear disaster between two superpowers. There's information that so many millions of Americans are not aware of that took place between President Kennedy and (Soviet Premier Nikita) Khrushchev. It's incredible to think how close we came to a nuclear holocaust. CNN:  It gives me chills to think about. Now, 50 years later, I understand you and the filmmakers were given unprecedented access by the JFK Library to make this documentary. Is that right? Modine: It is. A few years ago, I had the pleasure of reading a book about President Kennedy and his experiences as the captain of the PT-109 during the Second World War. And even if half the stuff in the book was an exaggeration, the 50% that's remaining makes me think that John Fitzgerald Kennedy was an absolute stud. And so now I have the honor of participating in this new John F. Kennedy documentary about the Cuban missile crisis. And intelligence and courage that he demonstrated against all odds is amazing. All of his advisers wanted him to engage Russia in a nuclear war, and he refused to take that route. He wanted to keep an open door policy and a conversation, a dialogue, with Khrushchev to avoid our two nations from going to war. It was through intelligence and negotiation that war was avoided. It just makes me love him and admire him all the more. CNN: In addition to the documentary and interactive materials like presidential memos, photos and expert testimony, tell me about this ""what if"" scenario people can check out. Modine: Yeah, absolutely. It's just terrifying. They hired actors to play the parts from the ""what if"" scenario, and when I first sat down to watch that part of the story, I was thinking, ""Jeez, I don't remember reading about that. I don't remember Americans getting hit by a nuclear bomb from Cuba. I don't remember the nuclear bomb being dropped on Cuba."" It's so well-performed and written and filmed that you'll think that you missed something about history. CNN: Is there a plan for giving this to schools? Modine: The JFK Library wants to share it with as many people as possible, not just at the library, but online and on television. So, it depends on who becomes the next president of the United States. If Mitt Romney gets his way, there won't be any more public broadcasting. And this is an example of why PBS is important -- because it can bring these kinds of stories to the American people, to help educate us and help us learn why peaceful negotiation is more beneficial than hawkish behavior. CNN: You've been married since 1980. I bet you know a few tricks about peaceful negotiation. Modine: I think I could teach John F. Kennedy a thing or two about the art of negotiation! (laughter) Love and marriage are complicated things. Fortunately, I was very good friends with my wife before I fell in love with her. Love is something that is forever changing and metamorphosing. And what you hope, and occasionally get lucky, is you have a partner who you can grow with and not grow apart from. I've been very fortunate that the journey I've been on with Cari Modine has been beautiful. CNN: That's very nice to hear. I know a lot of your ""Full Metal Jacket"" fans would love to hear that they are breathing new life into that film. Is there any chance of a remake or new chapter? Modine: No, Stanley Kubrick wouldn't have it. Stanley Kubrick is no longer with us, but the fortunate thing is that you don't need to remake the film. The unfortunate thing is that ""Full Metal Jacket"" is timeless, because we're still solving our differences with military might, rather that the lessons we learned from men like John F. Kennedy and the art of peaceful negotiations and diplomacy.","A new documentary provides viewers with a look at the Cuban missile crisis .

"(CNN) -- China's status a business superpower is transferring to the sporting world -- and its golfing ambitions took another step towards the big leagues on Sunday. Organizers of the HSBC Champions tournament announced that it has been upgraded to a full U.S. PGA Tour event, and will become part of the schedule for the prestigious end-of-season FedEx Cup playoffs. The tournament, which is already one of the four World Golf Championship events played each year, will boost its prize fund from $7 million this year to $8.5 million. Next year it will return to the Sheshan International Golf Club in Shanghai, where it was held for from 2005-2011 before going to Mission Hills in Shenzen for this week's staging -- which was won by Englishman Ian Poulter on Sunday. ""This is not so much a renewal as a rebirth -- it's a new dawn for HSBC Champions and for Asian golf which is now right at the top table of world golf,"" said Giles Morgan, head of sponsorship for the British multinational bank. ""When we first came to China in 2005, our ambition was to create a world-class international golf tournament in an emerging market. Eight years on and the HSBC Champions, complete with full FedExCup points and an increased prize fund, is up there with the very best, and today's announcement represents a major step forward for golf in China. ""Our involvement in golf at this elite level is underpinned by our continuing sponsorship of youth development and grassroots programs, including the HSBC China Junior Open."" Chinese soccer clubs have recently been investing large amounts in foreign players and coaches, but golf has been steadily developing in the country for the past decade -- especially with the sport returning to the Olympics in 2016. ""We hope the event will continue to play an important role to help grow the game of golf and improve the competition level of China,"" said General Zhang Xiaoning, executive vice-president and secretary of the country's golf association. China's development is already showing, with 14-year-old Guan Tian-Lang poised to make more history next year when he becomes the youngest player to start at the prestigious Masters Tournament in April. He qualified by winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship on Sunday, having already been the youngest player to line up at a European Tour event at this year's China Open. The HSBC Champions tournament had previously been co-sanctioned by the Asian and European Tours, and has been won by top golfers such as Phil Mickelson, Y.E. Yang, Martin Kaymer and Sergio Garcia. Poulter became the first Englishman to win two WGC events as he followed up his 2010 success at the Accenture Match Play by coming from behind to snatch the title on Sunday. The world No. 26, a hero of the European team's Ryder Cup victory in September, went into the final round four shots off the lead but fired a superb seven-under-par 65 to win by two and claim the $1.2 million first prize. ""I've already spent the check last week. I'm not going to tell you what it is until it arrives and I've got it home safe and sound, but yes, it was a vehicle, and yes, it was very expensive,"" he told reporters, having also finished fourth at the lucrative BMW Masters in Shanghai last weekend. ""I definitely think it is a part continuation of The Ryder Cup. I played great and I felt like I holed putts at the right time, which I did."" It was Poulter's 12th European Tour win and lifted him up to fourth in the Race To Dubai standings ahead of next week's Singapore Open -- where world No. 1 Rory McIlroy will return to action. The PGA Championship winner took the risk of skipping the HSBC Champions in order to rest, but remains on course to add the European Tour money list crown to his PGA Tour title after closest challenger Peter Hanson could finish only 24th equal with third-placed Justin Rose on Sunday. The Northern Irishman has a lead of more than â‚¬800,000 ($1 million) with three tournaments to play before the $8 million finale in Dubai at the end of this month. Poulter's second successive 65 left him clear of U.S. Ryder Cup rival Jason Dufner, who also surged up the leaderboard with a 64, Mickelson (68), South Africa's British Open champion veteran Ernie Els (67) and another American, Scott Piercy (65). Lee Westwood and Louis Oosthuizen had held a three-shot lead after Saturday's third round, but ended up tied for sixth on 18 under -- three behind Poulter -- after slumping to 72s. Former world No. 1 Westwood again fell short on the big stage -- he has never won a major, and this was his 41st attempt to win a WGC title. Oosthuizen won his first major at the 2010 British Open, and like that tournament the South African held a five-shot lead at the halfway stage here, but the world No. 11 was unable to add to his two titles this year. First-round leader Adam Scott of Australia tied for ninth with defending champion Kaymer of Germany.","Chinese golf tournament to become major part of U.S. PGA Tour next season .

"(CNN) -- The Rolling Stones performed an impromptu, warm-up gig at a small Paris club on Thursday night. The band tweeted about the secret show just hours before they took the stage at La Trabendo, writing that 350 tickets were up for grabs at â‚¬15 a pop. According to a press release, 600 fans were in attendance to see Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood. The Stones kicked off the intimate show with ""Route 66,"" before launching into ""It's Only Rock and Roll."" ""I can't believe we're all still standing up, you'd think by now one or two of us would be sitting down, but we're not,"" Jagger told the crowd. Mixed in with the classics was the recently released ""Doom and Gloom,"" the band's first new song together in seven years. They recorded the track in Paris and shot a video with Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, Jagger tweeted Wednesday. Closing their set with ""Midnight Rambler,"" they returned for an encore playing both ""Jumping Jack Flash"" and ""Brown Sugar."" The Rolling Stones are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year with four arena shows; they'll perform at London's O2 arena on November 25 and 29 before taking the stage at the Newark Prudential Center on December 13 and 15.

"(CNN) -- If you love ""Casablanca,"" here's your chance to play it again, and again, and again. One of the two pianos featured in the 1942 classic film starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman will be auctioned tomorrow in New York by Sotheby's. While Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) will always have Paris, you could walk away with Sam's iconic upright, especially if money is no object. ""The estimated price for the piano is $800,000 to $1.2 million,"" said David Redden, Vice Chairman at Sotheby's. ""But I don't want to speculate and scare people from bidding."" Redden is no stranger to this famous Hollywood prop. He first auctioned it off back in 1988. ""It was sold to a Japanese man and now it's come back to us,"" Redden told CNN. ""He paid $154,000 for it."" Any fan of the romantic film knows the piano played a central part in the flashback sequence at La Belle Aurore, where Rick and Ilsa listen to Sam sing ""As Time Goes By."" Dooley Wilson, the actor who portrayed Sam, was a trumpeter, not a pianist, according to Redden. ""He is sort of miming the fingering. But someone else is playing nearby and he was following the real player,"" Redden said. The piano, which only has 58 keys, also stands out for its diminutive size and distinct hue. ""Seeing the piano in real life you end up with a couple of things,"" said Redden. ""It's quite colorful, green and distressed yellow. And you don't realize how small it is, so small in fact Bogart and Bergman sort of tower over it."" ""It's called a studio piano and would have been wheeled around from person to person as the pianist played a favorite song. It can travel around quite easily."" The piano had no significant value in the golden age of moviemaking, Redden added. ""It would be re-used again and again,"" he said. The market for Hollywood memorabilia has exploded in recent years. The white ""subway"" dress Marilyn Monroe wore in 1955's ""The Seven Year Itch"" sold for a record $5.6 million in 2011. The blue gingham dress Judy Garland wore as Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"" was auctioned last month for $480,000. Could the Casablanca piano fetch more than Dorothy's dress? Redden believes it will. ""The piano is a star of the film,"" he said, ""the music is so emotive, so moving and the piano really becomes a symbol of the love story between Bogart and Bergman.""","One of the two pianos in ""Casablanca"" will be auctioned at Sotheby's Friday .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3 struck southern Mexico on Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake's epicenter was about 17 miles (27 kilometers) from Ometepec, Guerrero. It was about 7.6 miles (12 kilometers) deep, the USGS said. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Officials described the quake as an aftershock of the 7.4-magnitude temblor which struck in the same area on March 20, damaging hundreds of homes. There have been 280 aftershocks since that quake, Mexico's National Seismological Survey reported. Residents felt Monday's quake in Mexico City, hundreds of miles from the epicenter. There were no initial reports of major damage in the capital, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter. The USGS describes Mexico as one of the most seismically active areas of the world.

"(EW.com) -- ""Hello, Brooklyn!"" Barbra Streisand called out to her hometown's swanky new Barclay's Center early on in her three-plus hour concert. The last time she did a solo show in Brooklyn, she told the cheering crowd, was when she was 8 and singing on a stoop on Pulaski Street. Remember that, she asked her brother who was in the audience? (In case you're wondering, he scored good seats, not great.) She looked singularly Streisandly, in a shiny black number that had enough sheer to show off those famous legs. ""You like the dress?"" she asked the crowd. ""Good! Donna Karan!"" She complimented a member of the audience who must have been wearing a souvenir shirt. ""Did you buy it in the shop?"" she asked. ""It's cheaper online."" In other words, not much new material to be had tonight. But who wanted it? Certainly not concertgoers Katie Couric (who spent the intermission on her cell phone trying to find her friend's seat), Michael Strahan, or Jill Zarin (clad in a very Stevie Nicks-meets-Pucci ensemble). Despite waking up with a cold (""I'm drinking chicken soup"" she told the crowd of what she was sipping in her mug that sat next to â€” of course â€” a vase of roses), Streisand impressively powered through ""Enough is Enough,"" ""Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered,"" and ""Don't Rain on My Parade."" Sometimes her voice sounded strained, but more often the rasp worked for her. Her tribute to composer Marvin Hamlisch, who recently passed away, managed to be extremely touching, even as she read scripted lines off a teleprompter. She honored him with a mashup of ""The Way We Were"" and the completely awesome and underappreciated theme to Ice Castles. Who knew Marvin Hamlisch wrote that? Also, look out for the roses, Lexie! When Barbra wasn't singing or sipping chicken soup, there were other people to keep our ears busy. A lot of other people. First, Il Volo came out to remind us that Il Divo doesn't have the monopoly on young Italian tenors. Then hottie trumpet player Chris Botti came out and jammed with the drummer. Finally, Streisand's son Jason Gould showed up for some awkward banter (""She likes to touch my hair,"" he told the audience) and a solo song. Yes, Jason Gould got to sing a solo song to thousands of people, though I'm not entirely sure he'd make it through Hollywood week on American Idol. ""I am so proud of him,"" beamed his mama. Fans got to ask questions and we now know that Barbra likes smooth and all natural peanut butter, instead of chunky and chemical-filled. Other than that, she repeated her already-used ""I hope no one tells [Mitt Romney] how to get to Sesame Street or Pennsylvania Avenue"" line. She also told the crowd she doesn't sing Yiddish songs.

"(CNN) -- It would be easy for someone with Norah Jones' commercial and critical success to keep making albums that sound the same. In this millennium, where platinum (million-copy-selling) CDs are increasingly rare, each of her first four solo efforts has reached that lofty sales level, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Jones' 2002 debut, ""Come Away with Me,"" reigns as a diamond (10 million copies) selling album, a feat that may not be revisited often these days, with CD sales lagging. Jones' newest CD, ""Little Broken Hearts,"" debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Top 200 chart last month, making the singer five for five when it comes to her albums reaching the top three. But Jones hasn't played it safe in recent years, taking serious stylistic detours. Billboard named her its jazz artist of the decade for 2000 to 2009. But she has a history of diverse collaborations, including some with decidely non-jazz artists including the Foo Fighters, Willie Nelson and OutKast. In 2012, Jones has released an album with her country-tinged side project, the Little Willies, and her latest solo effort is a collaboration with a man best known for his hip-hop beats, Brian ""Danger Mouse"" Burton. ""I definitely don't make music based on other people's opinions or expectations, because I think that would be kind of weird,"" she said, adding, ""I definitely don't want to make the same album over and over, and I don't think I have. And I think if you do know everything I do, it makes a lot more sense. If you just know my first couple of albums, absolutely, it seems a little different."" Jones said ""Little Broken Hearts"" is a natural progression from her last few albums and from her work on Burton's ""Rome"" project last year. Jones said she and Burton enjoyed working together so much, she wanted to continue that relationship. ""I asked him if he wanted to produce some songs for me that I already had written for my last album, because I was looking for sort of a different sound, and I loved working with him on the 'Rome' album,"" she said. ""I knew that he had a whole different arsenal of sounds from what I was used to using. ""He said he'd love to work together, but he'd rather -- the way he works best, I think, is by being there from the start of the writing process,"" Jones continued. ""So, that's just totally different, because usually, I go in with songs already finished. And on this record, I went in with nothing, and we just wrote together, which was pretty fun, pretty different from how I've ever worked."" Jones said she and Burton wrote the songs organically, picking up instruments and jamming. ""Sometimes, I would play bass, which I don't even play,"" she said. ""But it sounded good, because he was playing drums and needed something to lock into the groove. Sometimes, I'd play guitar, or he would play guitar, and we'd both switch around on guitar and keyboards. "" Many reviews of ""Little Broken Hearts"" have focused on the angry, wistful lyrics and vocals that seem to depict a difficult breakup. Pointed songs such as ""She's 22"" and ""Miriam"" give the album emotional heft. But Jones says people may be reading too much into the album. ""It's just about sort of human interactions, which we all kind of go through. I mean, that's not really what we went into the studio trying to do,"" she said. ""It always feels good to write a song about an experience if you're feeling it. But, it also was a lot of storytelling, you know -- a lot of writing interesting stories together. And once we got going, we sort of felt like there was a theme, so we just kind of kept going (down) that path. "" Now, Jones and her band are meandering through three North American tour legs and two European legs through the end of October. They have been playing most of the new album at the earliest shows on this tour, and Jones says fans have been responding positively.

"(EW.com) -- Most of the muckraking Hollywood movies we think of as classic tend to sketch their dramas inside very clean and satisfying moral lines. ""Norma Rae"" was about a feisty union organizer fighting for basic workers' rights, ""All the President's Men"" was about two fearless newspaper reporters bringing down a corrupt president, and ""Erin Brockovich"" was about a heroic ordinary woman battling corporate malfeasance. ""Won't Back Down,"" a drama about the quasi-disaster that is today's American public education system, would very much like to be a ""Norma Rae""-style lump-in-the-throat rabble rouser, and to a good degree it succeeds. Yet the movie — to its credit — never denies the murky complexity of what's gone wrong in our schools. The moral lines here are by no means clean or easy to read. The film rightly pins our educational malaise on a great many diverse causes, from students mired in videogames to bad teachers to overly stodgy curriculum to good teachers who have sunk, over the years, into a kind of grinding hopelessness that just about anyone in their position might share. The movie is set in Pittsburgh, where Jamie, a financially strapped single mother played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (she works as a bartender as well as an auto-lot secretary), learns that her dyslexic daughter, Malia (Emily Alyn Lind), has been stuck in a dead-end classroom at John Adams, one of the lowest-rated schools in the city. After failing to win a coveted spot in a school lottery (a heartbreaking scene that sets the film's tone of hope teetering on rickety opportunities for success), Jamie decides to mount a fight to improve the school she's stuck with. But it's not because she gives a damn about being a ''crusader.'' She's acting out of a sheer, desperate, practical desire to get her daughter a decent education. She teams up with a gifted but morosely worn-down veteran teacher at John Adams, Nona (Viola Davis), who is trying to dig herself out of her own hole of apathy. And together, these two ignite a local movement to re-launch the school with a new, progressive program. They have to jump through a nightmarish array of bureaucratic hoops, which the film portrays in agonizing detail. They also have to take on the teachers' union, represented by Holly Hunter as a manipulative idealist who doesn't realize how much her own cherished orthodoxies have, over the years, become part of the problem. ""Won't Back Down"" has already attracted its share of heat from the nation's teachers' unions, so let me say up front that the movie doesn't demonize the union so much as it recognizes the point that director Davis Guggenheim made powerfully in his 2010 documentary Waiting for ''Superman'': that what the union now stands for — among other things, many of them good — is a lack of change. And ""Won't Back Down"" says that whatever your feelings about the subject, lack of change cannot be the answer to our public-education crisis. Trying to cram an informational exposé and a vintage inspirational awards-bait weeper into one movie, ""Won't Back Down"" is awkward at times, yet it's also passionate in a surprisingly smart way. It makes a genuine drama out of impossible issues. It is also, for the most part, very nicely acted. Gyllenhaal brings perhaps a bit too much movie-star-as-working-class-mom radiance to her role, yet she also makes you feel the agony of what Jamie is up against: the terror that her daughter is going to be doomed from grade school on. Marianne Jean-Baptiste, as the chief Pittsburgh school administrator, does an incisive and witty turn as an ice-cold bureaucrat who still has a trace of fire in her belly, and Viola Davis, in a brilliantly felt and thought-out performance, makes Nona by turns contained, furious, depressed, and stubbornly on point. Davis goes way beyond noble-educator sanctimony to show you the tug-of-war between devotion and despair that now defines too many of our teachers. ""Won't Back Down"" digs into such a complicated, no-easy-solution subject that I doubt the film will attract a very big audience, despite its genuine rouser of a climactic scene set at a school-board meeting. Yet it actually goes a step further than many of Hollywood's topical dramas by leaving you with something real. B+ . See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- A sprinkler system was turned off for more than an hour during a fire that devastated a California mall, a report says. The huge blaze occurred at the Westfield Galleria in Roseville, California, on October 21. Roseville police and fire officials released a report Friday about the blaze, which began when a man walked into a video game store and announced he had a weapon and was carrying a backpack that smelled of kerosene. The man was later identified as 23-year-old Alexander Piggee. Roseville police and fire departments rushed to the scene, but both stalled in entering the mall because of the possibility the suspect may have had a bomb, the report said. The report also said a maintenance worker at the mall shut off the sprinkler system in the section of the mall where the fire started for 71 minutes. It was unclear who told the maintenance worker to shut off the sprinklers. The maintenance worker said a police officer or sheriff's deputy told him to shut down the system, but no police officers or sheriff's deputies were on the scene at the time, according to the report. When questioned, the maintenance worker changed his story, saying that a UPS worker relayed a request from authorities to shut off the sprinkler system, according to the report. But the worker could not recall who started the request. It took a full day before the fire was knocked down. Two firefighters were injured during the blaze. The mall, about 18 miles northwest of Sacramento, was evacuated during the incident, and it remained closed after the suspect was arrested. No bomb has been recovered from the mall. The damage was so severe that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency at the time. The governor's order suspended one-week waiting period for store employees who seek unemployment benefits in Placer County.","Report: Sprinklers shut off for 71 minutes during fire at Roseville, California, mall .

"(CNN) -- A leader of the defeated Tamil Tiger rebel group has been arrested in Bangkok, Thailand, state television in Sri Lanka reported Thursday.

It also reported the arrest, citing the Sri Lankan government information department. The Sri Lankan military defeated the Tamil Tigers this year. The rebel group is formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. It fought a 25-year war seeking an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka. At least 70,000 were killed. Remnants of the battered Tamil Tiger group decided in July that Padmanathan would ""lead us into the next steps of our freedom struggle,"" according to a published account. That happened after the Sri Lankan military killed the group's long-time leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, in the final days of a bloody offensive that ended the war.","Selvarasa Padmanathan was""self-appointed leader Tamil Tigers""

"(CNN) -- Kerry Washington knows you have been waiting. The star of the hit ABC series ""Scandal"" is fully aware that there is a legion of ""gladiators in suits"" (as fans call themselves) eagerly awaiting the return of the series. She, too, is pretty excited to be back playing Washington, D.C. insider and crisis management expert Olivia Pope. Pope is a ""fixer"" who formerly worked for her lover, Republican President Fitzgerald Grant. When told that there are many women who try to emulate both Pope's sense of fashion and take-charge personality, Washington laughs. ""I do, too,"" she said. The series ended its first season with the revelation that the character Quinn Perkins, an employee of Pope's (and played by Katie Lowes), was not actually Quinn Perkins. Perkins calls Pope after she is jailed for the murder of her boyfriend, a reporter who was digging into the secrets of President Grant's administration. Did we mention that said president also happens to be in love with Pope? Season 2 answers the ""Who is Quinn"" question in the first episode, but Washington said there will be plenty of other surprises and mystery this season that even she isn't sure about. ""Every week is a surprise,"" she said. ""It's kind of ridiculous because we don't get an outline of the season, so the same way when [fans] watch it week to week and we live tweet with them and they are shocked, we feel that way when we read [the scripts] week to week. It's shocker after shocker and it's great."" While last season focused more on ""realizing no one is who you think they are,"" Washington said the new season will be more about ""how those secrets complicate other people's lives."" ""It's about how those secrets impact those around them, either because they know or they don't know,"" she said. ""Things get very complicated."" Not that Washington can be called on to unravel too much before the show's premiere Thursday night. The actress said there is no way she is trying to run afoul of series creator Shonda Rhimes by revealing plot lines. Washington is more comfortable talking about the other star of ""Scandal,"" Olivia Pope's stylish wardrobe. The actress said it's exciting that fans have gotten so into Pope's pantsuits and handbags, because she and costume designer Lyn Paolo have worked really diligently on Pope's look. ""We've always been on the same page in terms of her style,"" Washington said. ""A big part of that was this is a woman who used to work for the establishment, but now she works for herself. We wanted the clothes to be really elegant, smart and tailored in a D.C. aesthetic, but we also wanted to be more fashion forward and use more European designers, because she does work for herself and she has global clientele."" Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Scandal' Washington said Pope also doesn't shy away from her femininity and certainly not her sexuality, which has resulted in some steamy scenes with President Grant. The actress said she is loving the fact that not many eyebrows have been raised by the fact that a black female character on a television show is involved in a torrid romance with a white male character. ""I think the big deal is that it's not a big deal, and I think that's cool,"" Washington said. ""What I love is that the conversation is not 'Oh this is such a big deal,' but 'Oh how interesting that this is part of the full picture of who they are.'"" The actress said that it's fun for her to play ""inside the Beltway"" in a series that is not at all like the current political landscape. Washington is herself very politically aware, and spoke at the recent Democratic National Convention. Her interest in politics stems, she said, from her parents - especially her mother, a retired professor whose dinner parties exposed a young Washington to activism early on. ""As a kid, there would be dinners where her colleagues would be talking about a woman's right to choose, affirmative action and redistricting,"" Washington recalled. ""I grew up talking about these issues and knowing that politics were not separate from us as people."" Washington's next big project is the eagerly awaited Quentin Tarantino film ""Django Unchained."" The movie is set before the Civil War and Washington plays a slave whose husband (played by Jamie Foxx) seeks to rescue her from a brutal master on a Mississippi plantation. The project not only reunited Washington and Foxx, who appeared together in the Ray Charles bio-pic ""Ray,"" but it also gave the actress an opportunity to delve into a role that she said was challenging artistically and emotionally taxing. It was a part Washington said she's not sure she would have been able to portray were it not for having the balance of the Olivia Pope role on ""Scandal."" ""There would be days that would be so hard for me that Jamie Foxx would turn to me and say, 'How are you doing, Olivia,"" she said. ""It was to remind me that [the role as Broomhilda the slave] was not just it. I feel very blessed that at this point in my career I am able to play both of these women, because we have a full range of experience and identity and history. It's exciting to not just be defined by one section as to who we are as women and people of color.""","""Scandal"" returns for season 2 on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Pucks will fly as soon as next weekend if National Hockey League players ratify a collective bargaining agreement that won a seal of approval Wednesday from the league's board of governors. League officials hope for a truncated 48-game regular season to start January 19 if the 700 NHL athletes approve the pact. They are expected to complete voting by Saturday. The deal, reached Sunday with the NHL Players' Association, may end the three-month lockout and could salvage the second half of the season and the Stanley Cup playoffs. Jeremy Jacobs, owner of the Boston Bruins and chairman of the National Hockey League Board of Governors, announced ratification of the deal by the body. ""This great game has been gone for far too long, and for that we are truly sorry,"" Jacobs said in a statement. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said Sunday the ""basic framework"" of a deal was agreed upon after a 16-hour negotiating session at a Manhattan hotel. The NHL scrapped its preseason and all games through the end of 2012 after its contract with the players expired on September 15, with no agreement between the two sides. There were 526 games, nearly 43% of the season, scheduled from the start of the regular season on October 11 through December 30, the NHL said. Sports Illustrated has tracked the intricacies of the talks and flashpoint issues, and argued that the NHL is ""in dire need"" of a new way of handling labor relations. A similar labor dispute canceled the entire 2004-05 NHL season.","League's board of governors OKs deal; now players will vote .

"(CNN) -- Denied a proper buildup to the Australian Open for the second year in a row, Maria Sharapova has taken out her injury frustrations on some of the host country's most promising young male tennis players. The planet's highest-paid female athlete will line up in Melbourne for the 10th time next week, confident she has overcome the neck problem that ruled her out of the Brisbane International earlier this month. The world No. 2, who was hampered by an ankle injury before going on to lose last year's final, will play 105th-ranked fellow Russian Olga Puchkova in her opening match. ""I would have loved to come in with a few matches, but sometimes circumstances don't allow that,"" she told reporters on Saturday, having earlier presented the global launch of her new candy line ""Sugarpova."" ""To me I'd rather be going on to the court knowing that I'm healthy. Yes, I might be a little bit rusty, but I'll work my way through it. I'm experienced enough to know the adjustments I have to make in those types of circumstances. I went to Brisbane. I certainly would have loved to step on court and play those matches."" Instead the 25-year-old, who won the season's opening grand slam in 2008, got into shape with matches against male opposition. ""I think one of them got a wildcard in the main draw,"" Sharapova said. ""One of them was really on top and then I got really mad. I think he had eight set-points and I ended up winning the set. ""I'm not going to tell who it is -- too embarrassed. I don't think he slept well after that one. ""Another one, I think it was Luke Saville, we didn't actually finish. The set took too long."" Defending champion Victoria Azarenka and third-ranked Serena Williams will be among Sharapova's main opposition as she seeks to win her fifth grand slam title, having completed the set at last year's French Open. Olympic champion Williams has won the last two grand slams, at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, and beat Sharapova in the final of the season-ending WTA Championships in Turkey. The American, who has won the Australian Open five times, downplayed suggestions that she could win all four grand slams this year and take her total to 19 -- which would put the 31-year-old equal third on the alltime list. ""That's an incredible goal. It hasn't been done since the '80s,"" said Williams, who will start against 106th-ranked Romanian Edina Gallovits-Hall in top form following her title in Brisbane. ""I don't know if I can do it. Maybe someone else can. We'll see."" Azarenka pulled out of her Brisbane semi against Williams after needing toe surgery to fix a botched pedicure, but she is hoping to build on the self-belief she gained from winning her maiden grand slam 12 months ago. ""It definitely helped to bring a lot of inner confidence in myself, knowing that I can do it,"" said the 23-year-old, who will play 54th-ranked Romanian Monica Niculescu. ""That feeling that I had was incredible. Since then, I want to feel it again. This is what motivates me even more every day. It's amazing, when you achieve your dream, your goal, how much more motivated you are after that."" Fourth-ranked Agnieszka Radwanska sent out a warning to the top three by thrashing Dominika Cibulkova 6-0 6-0 in Friday's final of the Sydney International. It was the first ""double bagel"" in a WTA Tour final since 2006 as Cibulkova was unable to repeat the form that had eliminated top-10 players Petra Kvitova, Sara Errani and Angelique Kerber earlier in the tournament. Radwanska is now unbeaten in nine matches in 2013, with the Pole having also won the event in Auckland, New Zealand last weekend -- her 11th WTA Tour title. Meanwhile, Bernard Tomic boosted his hopes of a strong performance in his home grand slam by winning the men's title in Sydney -- his first on the ATP Tour. The 20-year-old, who had a disappointing 2012 season, will return to the top 50 following Saturday's 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 victory over 36th-ranked South African Kevin Anderson. He also beat world No. 1 Novak Djokovic as he won all three singles matches at the Hopman Cup mxed teams warmup event in Perth earlier this month. ""Now that I know what it feels like to win a tournament and it's the best feeling in the world,"" Tomic said. ""I'm looking forward to Melbourne. I feel unstoppable."" Veteran Australian Lleyton Hewitt is also in form ahead of Melbourne, having won the Kooyong Classic exhibition. The former world No. 1 beat world No. 7 Juan Martin del Potro on Saturday, having earlier defeated sixth-ranked Tomas Berdych and No. 15 Milos Raonic. Now back up to 82nd in the rankings after falling out of the top 200, the 2005 Australian Open runner-up will play ninth-ranked Janko Tipsarevic in his opening match. ""I'm extremely happy with how I'm hitting the ball at the moment, and a lot of the pressure's on him,"" Hewitt said of the Serbian, who has suffered wrist problems since winning the Chennai Open in India this month.","Maria Sharapova says she is fit for the start of the Australian Open next week .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Bob Dylan describes ""Tempest,"" his 35th studio album (out September 11th), as a record where ""anything goes and you just gotta believe it will make sense."" But it isn't the record he set out to make. ""I wanted to make something more religious,"" he says. ""I just didn't have enough [religious songs]. Intentionally, specifically religious songs is what I wanted to do. That takes a lot more concentration to pull that off 10 times with the same thread -- than it does with a record like I ended up with."" The ""anything goes"" album he ended up with is full of big stories, big endings and transfixing effect. The disc was recorded in Jackson Browne's studio in L.A. with Dylan's touring band -- bassist Tony Garnier, drummer George G. Receli, steel guitarist Donnie Herron, and guitarists Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball -- as well as David Hidalgo on guitar, violin and accordion. ""Tin Angel"" is a devastating tale of a man in search of his lost love; the doleful ""Soon After Midnight"" seems to be about love (but maybe it's revenge); the vengeful ""Pay in Blood"" has Dylan darkly repeating, ""I pay in blood, but not my own."" Tenderness finally seals Tempest, in ""Roll On, John,"" Dylan's heartfelt tribute to his friend John Lennon. The title track is a nearly 14-minute depiction of the Titanic disaster. Numerous folk and gospel songs gave accounts of the event, including the Carter Family's ""The Titanic,"" which Dylan drew from. ""I was just fooling with that one night,"" he says. ""I liked that melody -- I liked it a lot. 'Maybe I'm gonna appropriate this melody.' But where would I go with it?"" Elements of Dylan's vision of the Titanic are familiar -- historical figures, the inescapable finality. But it's not all grounded in fact: The ship's decks are places of madness (""Brother rose up against brother. They fought and slaughtered each other""), and even Leonardo DiCaprio appears. (""Yeah, Leo,"" says Dylan. ""I don't think the song would be the same without him. Or the movie."") ""People are going to say, 'Well, it's not very truthful,' "" says Dylan. ""But a songwriter doesn't care about what's truthful. What he cares about is what should've happened, what could've happened. That's its own kind of truth. It's like people who read Shakespeare plays, but they never see a Shakespeare play. I think they just use his name."" Dylan's mention of Shakespeare raises a question. The playwright's final work was called ""The Tempest,"" and some have already asked: Is Dylan's ""Tempest"" intended as a last work by the now 71-year-old artist? Dylan is dismissive of the suggestion. ""Shakespeare's last play was called 'The Tempest.' It wasn't called just plain 'Tempest.' The name of my record is just plain 'Tempest.' It's two different titles."" This story is from the August 16th, 2012 issue of Rolling Stone. See full story at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- In 2005, Brian Baker was one of the rising stars of American tennis. Aged just 20, he recorded a shock win over world No. 9 Gaston Gaudio at the U.S. Open. Despite being beaten in the second round, the future looked bright for the Tennessee native. However, it was to be his last match at a grand slam tournament for seven years as a nightmare series of injuries and operations threatened to end his promising career. ""I was the No. 2-ranked junior in the world,"" Baker told CNN's Open Court. ""I was hoping to start off with a bang on the ATP Tour and have a successful career, whether top 50, top 10 or top 20."" Instead, he had to have five surgeries in four years. And until recently, his only involvement in tennis was playing on the low-ranking Challenger Tour and coaching his college team. Roddick exits early at French Open . As well as elbow and hernia injuries, the root of Baker's fitness problems lie with a hip condition which has troubled him since he was a boy. ""Femoroacetabular Impingement is a developmental condition that has to do with the way his hip formed when he was probably nine or 10 years old,"" Doctor Thomas Byrd told CNN. ""There's an overgrowth around the socket where the femoral head grows out, sort of like the front end of your car being a little out of alignment. It leads to some uneven wear inside the hip. ""What's remarkable to me he was able to reach such an elite status in the first place. He was spending as much time battling his hips as he was his opponent."" But now Baker is back on the big stage, having made a remarkable comeback. On Wednesday, the 27-year-old will play in the second round of a grand slam for the second time in his career. Learn more about Baker's next French Open opponent . Having been awarded a wildcard entry to the French Open after winning a Challenger tournament in April, Baker reached his first ATP Tour final at a warmup event in Nice last weekend. He lost that match, but won his opener at Roland Garros on Monday against the man who beat him in New York in 2005, Belgium's world No. 77 Xavier Malisse. Baker next faces a much tougher test against French 11th seed Gilles Simon, but his family are just glad to see him back out on the court enjoying himself. ""I was just so happy for him because that's what he'd worked all this time to go back for,"" said his father Steve. ""Now that he's done that we hope to have a good time in Paris. ""We've watched him play in grand slam matches before; it's not the first time. I always thought I would one day go to see him play in Roland Garros."" The famous clay-court venue holds special memories for Baker, who reached the 2003 French Open boys' final before losing to Switzerland's Stanislaw Wawrinka -- who has since enjoyed a steady career and is ranked 21st in the world. While players such as Marcos Baghdatis and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga -- both of whom he beat during that Roland Garros run -- were winning titles and climbing the rankings, Baker was trying to rescue his fading career. ""I think Marcus beat me a couple of times, but I got the better of him a few more times,"" Baker told CNN. ""That was right when I was coming back from my first hip surgery. ""I had no idea I was going to have four more surgeries ... I can't remember who he beat, (David) Nalbandian and somebody else. It definitely gave me some motivation -- maybe if I come back I could have some good results."" Baker's return gained real momentum in Nice. Before losing to defending champion Nicolas Almagro in the final, he scored notable wins over former junior rival and world No. 14 Gael Monfils and Russia's former No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko, a 21-time title winner on the ATP Tour. ""Every time you go onto court you want to win,"" Baker told the ATP Tour's official website after his final defeat. ""I am a competitor, I hate losing. But, when you look at the week as a whole, it has been an unbelievable week. ""I hoped to qualify at the start of the week and win a match or two before going to Roland Garros. I obviously did much better. ""I think even in the qualifying, I felt as if I was playing pretty well. I won my three matches easily and knew I was playing good tennis."" Baker's compatriot John Isner, ranked 11th in the world, is pleased to see his former junior rival back competing at the highest level. ""We are virtually the exact same age,"" Isner told CNN. ""We were born days apart in and played in the juniors, he was hands down one of the best players in the country. ""He definitely deserves it and he has worked really hard. And he hasn't let all of these obstacles discourage him. ""He is still doing what he loves and that is playing tennis -- and he is doing very well. You know, without more injuries and if he can stay healthy, I can see him in the top 100.""","Brian Baker is playing in his first grand slam event since the 2005 U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- A New Hampshire teenager accused of killing a woman and severely injuring her daughter during a brutal home invasion was found guilty Tuesday of first degree murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Steven Spader sat emotionless as the verdict was read in the trial for the gruesome murder of Kimberly Cates in Mont Vernon, New Hampshire, last year. Spader, 19, was convicted of breaking into Cates' home and hacking her to death with a machete, while his friend, 19-year-old Christopher Gribble, repeatedly stabbed her 11-year-old daughter Jaimie as she tried to defend her mother. ""I could go on for days about the depth of your depravity,"" said Judge Gillian Abramson. ""It is sufficient to say, you belong in a cage."" A medical examiner determined Cates, a 42-year-old nurse, had died from ""multiple sharp injuries to the head, torso, left arm, and left leg."" The victim's daughter sustained serious knife injuries that required hours of surgery. Cates' husband, who was away on business at the time of the attack, addressed the court in a prepared statement. ""Kim and I had dreams, hopes, aspirations... now shattered,"" he said. ""With one phone call on a Sunday morning, all those dreams were lost."" His daughter, Jaimie, did not testify. Three co-defendants brokered plea deals, pleading guilty to associated charges while testifying against Spader. Gribble is expected to stand trial in February.","Three co-defendants broker a plea agreement .

"(Rolling Stone) -- An impossibly high-pitched ""aaahh"" ascended from a churchy organ vamp, proclaiming D'Angelo's arrival on the biggest stage he has played since his legendary Voodoo tour. Clad in rugged boots, leather vest and trademark tanktop (all black), he appeared with a perfect confidence and poise that belied his recently broken 12-year hiatus from the stage. His performance at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans has been anticipated as D'Angelo's American comeback, but the reclusive R&B polymath has been unfolding a cautious return. It began this January with a short European club tour, which confirmed that he hadn't lost an ounce of mojo. He also added a batch of new songs to his repertoire. The Essence show was the first U.S. gig on the books, but he warmed up to his big night by jamming covers with ""co-pilot"" ?uestlove at Bonnaroo, playing a new song on TV for the BET Awards, and running through a full set -- a dress rehearsal of sorts -- on the 4th of July at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. So come Essence Fest, D'Angelo and his band of virtuoso studio pros (including Pino Palladino on bass and Chris ""Daddy"" Dave on the drums) were locked in tight. They articulated every breathy, rhythmic nuance from D'Angelo's distinctive palate. One song instantly became another when D'Angelo clutched his fist -- classic stage magic he picked up from his idols, or ""yodas,"" as he calls them. The frequent falsetto yelps -- ""good God!"" -- suggested the night's yoda du jour was James Brown, although his side-by-side guitar solos with Jesse Johnson (from the Time) found D playing at Prince as well. D'Angelo coolly picked along to ""Playa Playa"" on guitar and sang a breezy take on Roberta Flack's ""Feel Like Makin' Love,"" embellished by the lush harmonies of his powerhouse backup vocalists. A new song known as ""Ain't That Easy"" followed, featuring a chunky bass riff that gave way to some of D's most accessible melodies. He's so comfortable playing the new material that it's easy to hear the songs as centerpieces of future shows. He ditched the guitar for ""Devil's Pie,"" which freed up his body to muscularly saunter about the stage and viciously headbang with dynamo vocalist Kendra Foster. A sturdy ""Chicken Grease"" led into the gentle ""Really Love,"" an unreleased song that ?uestlove leaked on Australian radio back in 2007, which featured D's high-flying, taught falsetto accompanied by smooth guitar licks. The 70-minute festival set was brief for D's shows, so many of the grooves were abbreviated. Yet one song that got completely deconstructed and jammed back together was ""S**t, Damn, Motherf***er."" The pleading opening verse was the band's most intense, raw moment. As the song revved up, D and his singers stalked around the stage in a frenzy, resulting in some toppled drums. Despite the spike in energy onstage, much of the crowd remained politely subdued. D'Angelo's set came between Trey Songz and Charlie Wilson, both of whom quickly had the mostly female, mostly adult Essence attendees on their feet. After Songz' saccharine crooning, D'Angelo sounded downright unruly, almost abrasive. R&B is a nebulous descriptor, but D'Angelo's funk and soul abstractions highlighted how his approach to the genre is distinct from the festival's other acts. Still, he has one undeniable number, and it successfully ensnared the audience. Solo on piano, he abruptly banged out the opening chord to ""Untitled (How Does It Feel),"" and the energy in the Superdome immediately focused into a deafening flurry of screams. He stopped playing, stood up, shook his head, then flashed a cheeky grin. In perfect time, he gracefully returned to his infamous mega-hit, played beautifully and stripped bare. ""Untitled"" provided the crowd nostalgic pleasure that doubled as a gateway into the richness of D'Angelo's prodigious talents, if maybe a few songs too late. A well-timed ""Lady"" broke the slow jam spell, and he closed out with his superb new funk thumper, ""Sugah Daddy."" He rode his new groove until the show's close, screaming, wailing, and frantically conducting the band's final notes. As the heir-apparent to practically every iconic soul singer, the pressure to finish his third studio album and get back on the road has been markedly high, but his solid performance on the big stage proves he has yet to flinch. The comeback will continue later this summer when D'Angelo tours with Mary J. Blige, Essence's Saturday headliner. Just before D's set, Blige commented on the upcoming tour to Rolling Stone, saying ""I felt like it would be refreshing and fun for people to see him and Mary J. Blige on the road together."" Their tour will make 20 stops in August. See full story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","R & B singer D'Angelo returned to the stage at Essence Fest after a 12-year hiatus .

"(CNN) -- Tim Burton's most enjoyable movie in a long time, ""Frankenweenie"" suggests this improbable blockbuster director is at his best when he's playing to an audience of one: himself. It's never hard to spot Burton's signature: the baroque ghoulish visuals, macabre humor and topsy-turvy morality are always front and center. Johnny Depp is usually in there somewhere too. But lately Burton has seemed more like a stylist or a decorator than a director. Though his recent movies retain his signature style and visual panache, they seem to lack compelling characters and stories. ""Frankenweenie"" is different. There's a direct emotional connection. This time it's personal. It's also perfectly scaled. John August's witty screenplay is based on a short film Burton came up with nearly 30 years ago, the story of a boy who plays Frankenstein to try to revive his dead dog. The running time has stretched by more than 80 minutes, but that's still the essence of the new film, a lustrous black and white 3D stop-motion animation that doubles as a love letter to old horror movies and a classic boy-and-his-dog story. Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) is an introverted youngster, but also an ingenious kid who likes to make monster movies starring his best friend, Sparky. Encouraged by his dad to get out and play some ball with the other kids, Victor enjoys an unexpected moment of glory when he hits a home run. But triumph turns to tragedy when Sparky chases the ball into the street and is struck and killed by a car. And that would be that, except that Victor's new teacher, Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) inspires him to think big for the science fair; and then there are the electrical storms that are a peculiarity to this otherwise normal small town. Reveling in the expressionist, shadowy style of early sound films, Burton doesn't quite match James Whale's 1930 original ""Frankenstein"" in the resurrection scene, but he does have a lot of fun crafting a contemporary echo chamber in which Victor's classmates are shrunken clones of old Universal creature feature stalwarts. One kid is a gap-toothed, hunchbacked Ygor; another is a sinisterly cerebral Asian; then there's the weird girl who thinks her kitty's litter carries evil portent. Creepy as the kids are, the parents are worse, transforming into a lynch mob when their little darlings start taking too much interest in science. (They do have a point though: When several assignments get out of hand, the town's parade turns is crashed by a group of rampaging monsters.) But Victor is a fine hero, immediately a more sympathetic figure than his famous namesake, and the patched-up Sparky has personality -- and limbs -- to spare. In fact, bits keeping dropping off, and when he takes a drink, he leaks a little, but it's nothing Victor can't fix. After ""Paranorman,"" ""Hotel Transylvania"" and ""Frankenweenie"" it appears Hollywood has pretty much got the family horror category covered. More sensitive children may find the gothic pet cemetery upsetting and freak out at the violent climax. Burton's film should appeal most to mom and dad, anyone with a soft spot for Boris Karloff, and twisted teens looking for ideas to reanimate their own science projects. Just add relish.","A boy who loses his dog brings him back in ""Frankenweenie""

"(CNN) -- Season three of AMC's wildly popular zombie-apocalypse drama, ""The Walking Dead,"" wrapped its midseason finale on Sunday night. Fans will have to wait until February for new episodes, but the last eight weeks have been fruitful ones, with introductions to new characters such as Michonne (Danai Gurira) and The Governor (David Morrissey) as well as goodbyes for a few mainstays such as Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton). Along with a healthy dose of weekly zombie slayings, this season has also raised new questions about where the show's heading, mainly with The Governor introducing a cryptic desire to research the reasons behind the zombie apocalypse. CNN spoke with ""The Walking Dead"" showrunner Glen Mazzara about the themes and motivations prevalent in season three, what to expect in the second half and the joys of writing while listening to Prince. CNN: We're at the halfway point in season three. What's the difference in storytelling and the visuals compared with season two? Glen Mazzara: We're swinging for the fences every week. We have a very accelerated pace of storytelling, where we're trying to pack as much story into every episode, and yet, spending a lot of time developing our characters. We're not afraid to have quiet scenes that have a lot of heart in them. We've really found a nice balance having those quiet, heartfelt scenes, mixed with moments of pure terror and action. It's important for us to realize that these are desperate characters, living in a frantic world. No place is safe; that's something that's really important. For example, in the episode in which Lori died, we wanted to make sure that prison never feels safe. If you look at it in the first four episodes, they have three major battles with zombies at the prison. That's something that our audience responds to: that our characters are always on the knife's edge. CNN: Speaking of the knife's edge, Michonne and The Governor were two highly anticipated characters at the start of this season. How do these actors bring these characters to life? Mazzara: Danai was raised at some point in Africa. She comes from a cultural experience where there was a lot of war and very, very strong female survivors. That's something she's used as a model for Michonne -- the strength of the women who suffered great abuses yet carried on. She has a strength and an aggressiveness but also a grace. That is unique. We haven't seen that character to that extent on TV. I'm really proud of the work that she's doing. David Morrissey is an incredibly talented actor who is just interested in finding new layers and nuance to this character. He and I talked about what was driving The Governor, what his agenda was, and how that begins to unravel. He gives it a tremendous amount of thought to every scene. I've learned a lot about acting from just watching his work. CNN: The Governor's interest in trying to control this new world and adapt is very different from Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his crew. Mazzara: He expects to be the victor. Because the victor writes history. And The Governor wants history to be written about him. CNN: The fight scene between The Governor and Michonne in episode eight (""Made to Suffer"") is pretty brutal. Mazzara: Part of the experience of watching ""The Walking Dead"" is that you're leaning in; anything is possible. In that particular scene, The Governor could kill Michonne; Michonne could kill The Governor. It could go any way. The idea that Andrea (Laurie Holden) walks in and the two women enter this spell of which so much is being said without dialogue is just a well-done scene. CNN: Episode eight also saw the introduction of another new character, Tyreese (Chad Coleman), who's probably best known for his role on ""The Wire."" Did he audition, or did you all seek him out? Mazzara: He was someone we had in mind. He was very interested in coming in and auditioning. One of our main directors is Ernest Dickerson, and he directed a number of (""The Wires"" episodes). He said, ""If you could get Chad, that would be great."" So Chad felt like a friend of the family, and he came in and we chatted. He's just having a great time and is excited about being a part of the show. Tyreese is a good man who is faced with the same horrible situations that Rick has faced, but he may not have that darkness within him to make the same choices. CNN: Human-on-human violence in this season seems much more prevalent versus the first two seasons. Do the actors have a different take on killing other actors versus zombies? Mazzara: You'd have to ask the actors. I'd say in the conversation that I've had with the actors -- it's very interesting to see themselves as a part of that group and everyone else is a threat or the other. The actors come in, and I guess it's the way that they are directed or it's written. ... They are very connected to their characters and their characters' associations. For example, episode seven (""When the Dead Come Knocking"") was the first time Rick had met Michonne. It was very interesting because Andrew had notes on that script that were like, ""Why would I trust that woman? Why would I let her into the prison?"" He was really living his character. He said, ""Rick would never trust this woman."" You could see that there's a lot of work that the actors do on their own characters, and we as writers listen and incorporate those dynamics into the scripts. It's an incredibly collaborative process. The way that the show's been written in the third season is that the characters become more comfortable with killing because they are so used to killing the dehumanized walkers. So it's easy for them to extrapolate that another threat can be dehumanized. Pay close attention to the language The Governor is using when he refers to Rick and his group and also in the back half of the season, how Rick and his group refer to Woodbury. The audience has all this information. The audience knows that the people of Woodbury are decent people being misled by The Governor. The audience knows that Rick and his group are a bunch of good-hearted survivors, but yet it's very possible for The Governor to portray them as blood-thirsty murderers to the people of Woodbury because that's what they were. This question of humanity and dehumanization is right at the heart of the third season. CNN: What's in store for the rest of season three? Mazzara: All of the pieces are up and running: Woodbury, the prison, The Governor, Michonne, the reintroduction of Merle. Everyone is now onstage. Now it will be interesting to see all of the shifting alliances and all the dynamics. We don't slow down the pace, and we continue to have very high stakes. But we'll see a lot more nuanced character drama and some real interesting personal dilemmas for these characters. CNN: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe your Twitter (account) said you were writing the final episode of season three while listening to Prince. Mazzara: That is true. I got into a Prince groove. I was listening to a lot of Prince. What's great about Prince is -- first of all, he's a musical genius. But he plays so many different types of music: R&B and funk, and I have some stuff where he's playing jazz. Listening to Prince is listening to a lot of different types of eclectic music. CNN: I love the idea that you can get into the head space of writing a very dark episode, and something like ""Let's Go Crazy"" is on in the background at some point. Mazzara: Maybe. I don't know if it was ever officially released, but he has a song called ""The Undertaker"" that's really great to write to.","""Anything is possible,"" showrunner Glen Mazzara says of ""The Walking Dead""

"(EW.com) -- As the title character of Steven Spielberg's solemnly transfixing ""Lincoln,"" Daniel Day-Lewis is tall and elegantly stooped, with thatchy gray-black hair, sunken cheeks, and a grin that tugs at the corners of his mouth whenever he tries to win someone over by telling them a good story (which is often). Day-Lewis looks so much like the photographs of Abraham Lincoln that you don't have to squint, even a bit, to buy that it's him. He nails Lincoln's thousand-yard stare — a gaze directed at once inward (at the whir of his own mental machinery) and outward (at the cosmic hum of history). Day-Lewis' performance has a beautiful gravitas, yet there's nothing too severe about it. He gives Lincoln a surprisingly plainspoken, reedy high voice that retains the courtly cadences of the South. That voice — from everything we know, it's quite accurate — makes Lincoln sound like Will Rogers as a professor of human nature. This Lincoln lives deep inside his own unruly-haired head, yet he loves the people around him, even the ignorant (and racist) common folk, who repay the favor by loving him back. And that's where he draws his political force. Photos: 'Lincoln' extras pose for portraits . ""Lincoln,"" which Spielberg has directed from a lyrical, ingeniously structured screenplay by Tony Kushner, is one of the most authentic biographical dramas I've ever seen. But that doesn't mean it's a stiff-jointed history lesson. The movie is grand and immersive. It plugs us into the final months of Lincoln's presidency with a purity that makes us feel transported as though by time machine. (Kushner is the husband of EW columnist Mark Harris.) Most of the film unfolds in January 1865, shortly after Lincoln's reelection, when he knows that the North is going to win the Civil War. The real battle for him now is the fight against slavery. Three commissioners from the Confederacy head up to Washington City, and Lincoln is confident that he could have their surrender within a week. But before that can happen, he is driven to pass the 13th Amendment, which would outlaw slavery. The Democrats hate the amendment, and even Lincoln's liberal Republican comrades want him to delay the vote. Only Lincoln grasps the stakes: that once the Civil War is over, the amendment won't pass — it will be blocked by the Southern states. Winning the war could prove a Pyrrhic victory. Only by threading the amendment through the eye of a legislative needle can he alter the course of history. Lincoln features a great deal of incendiary speech-making on the floor of the House of Representatives, and Kushner's script, which is based in part on the Doris Kearns Goodwin book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, has a lot of fun weaving insults of astonishing brazenness into oratory that lays bare the issues in all their gripping moral complexity. Spielberg, denying himself visual fireworks, frames the action with a kind of stately tension. He thrillingly demythologizes Lincoln by placing us inside Lincoln's experience — shut up by himself (or with his querulous cabinet) in the drab meeting rooms of the White House, or in his bedroom with the ambitious, haunted Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field), who still blames Abe for the death of their son Willie. Field's performance is shattering — in a few furious scenes, she redefines this First Lady as a woman whose supposed madness reflected a humane fervor as sterling as her husband's. As the congressional fight rages on, ""Lincoln"" orchestrates it all. He seduces, cajoles, begs, and tyrannizes. He offers patronage jobs — bribes — to the Democratic congressmen who support slavery. He courts but also tamps down the influence of Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), the abolitionist who's so possessed by the cause that he might alienate any congressman on the fence. And through it all, Lincoln must delay the war's end — without breaking the people's faith. The Lincoln we see here is that rare movie creature, a heroic thinker. He has the serpentine intellect of a master lawyer, infused with a poet's passion. ""Lincoln"" brilliantly dramatizes the delicacy of politics, along with the raw brutality of it. All that's pushing the amendment forward is Abe Lincoln's will, his ability to do anything — even flirt with impeachable deceptions — to fulfill his vision of justice. And that's why he spends the movie alone in spirit. When he bangs his hand on the table, roaring at his lobbyists to procure him the votes he needs because he's ''clothed in immense power,'' we're seeing the birth of the presidency as we know it — a force that can shape the consciousness of the world. Lincoln is a stirring paradox, a dream of history as it might truly have happened. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- After England's shock victory over top-ranked New Zealand on Saturday, rugby fans were delighting in the prospect that the two nations might be drawn together for the 2015 World Cup. However, such a meeting will not happen before the knockout stages of the tournament after hosts England came out of the hat with Australia and Six Nations champions Wales and two qualifiers in Group A on Monday. The All Blacks, who won the World Cup on home soil last year for the first time since its inaugural staging in 1987, will line up against Argentina, Tonga and a qualifier from Europe and Africa in Group C. The Kiwis were top of the four seeds along with South Africa, Australia and last year's runners-up France. The French will take on Ireland, Italy and qualifiers from Europe and the Americas in Group D while the Springboks -- champions in 2007 -- will play Samoa, Scotland and teams from the Asia and Americas playoffs. England unexpectedly halted New Zealand's 20-match unbeaten run with a 38-21 win at Twickenham, having lost narrowly to South Africa and Australia in the traditional end-of-season tour matches by southern hemisphere sides. Following that upset result, 2003 World Cup-winning coach Clive Woodward said his country would be the team that all others hoped to avoid at Monday's draw in London. Present coach Stuart Lancaster hopes his young England team can continue to develop and peak in time to survive in the toughest group of the 2015 World Cup -- only two teams go through from each pool. It will be the first time that England and Wales have met in the group stage. ""It is definitely a pretty tough pool. To win the World Cup you have to win big games and I have got a huge amount of respect for what Wales have done recently,"" Lancaster told the English RFU website. ""We know their squad pretty well, it is a young side and a lot of them will still be around in 2015. Australia have just beaten us and if you look at the age and profile of their squad, they have got some young lads as well. We will look forward to it."" Lancaster took over the coaching role from Martin Johnson, who was unable to emulate his 2003 World Cup success as a player when the England team traveled Down Under last year. Hampered by off-field controversies, the English failed to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1999, when they were hosts. ""Twelve months ago I went out to New Zealand for two weeks and got a little sample of what it is like and the impact on that country,"" Lancaster said. ""We have seen what the Olympic Games did for our country and the next big sporting event is the 2015 Rugby World Cup. By that time everybody is going to be revved up and it's going to be a big party."" Meanwhile, New Zealand's Dan Carter has been named as the International Rugby Board's world player of the year for the second time. The fly-half has bounced back from the disappointment of missing most of the 2011 World Cup due to injury by inspiring the All Blacks to a perfect record of six wins in the inaugural Rugby Championship -- which featured the Tri-Nations teams plus Argentina -- and victory in the Bledisloe Cup series against Australia for the 10th year in a row. The 30-year-old extended his world record points-scoring tally to 1,385 from 94 Tests despite a below-par performance against England. Carter headed off his captain Richie McCaw, a three-time winner, England's Owen Farrell -- who scored 17 points on Saturday -- and France fly-half Frederic Michalak. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen followed his predecessor Graham Henry by keeping that award in New Zealand's ownership, while the Kiwis were also named best team for the third year in a row.","All Blacks drawn with Argentina and Tonga in draw for 2015 Rugby World Cup .

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""I got nowhere to go ever since I came back,"" Chris Cornell growls over a warped-alloy guitar charge on ""Been Away Too Long,"" the lead single from the first Soundgarden album since 1996. He's singing about Seattle, about coming home after years away and feeling out of place in his own hometown. He's also talking about a sound: the grunge his band helped define, and which once dominated rock's mainstream. Now, there isn't much of a rock mainstream left to dominate; big, heavy, high-protein bands like Soundgarden are all but extinct. Which is exactly why ""King Animal"" is a weirdly cool beast to encounter in 2012 -- like running into a mastodon in a Melvins T-shirt. The band's sound manages to be as ageless as it is anachronistic. Soundgarden were the crusty hard-rock true believers amid alt-rock's self-appointed revolutionaries: If Nirvana wanted to shred your world and Pearl Jam strove to redeem it, Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, bassist Ben Shepherd and drummer Matt Cameron wanted to take you out in the woods with a six-pack and headbang to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. King Animal shows they haven't forgotten how to stomp out the jams: Thayil is still a warlock guitar conjurer of the first order, and Cornell rolls around his multi-octave vocal range like some kind of backwoods metal-Mariah. The album follows their root sound down all kinds of mossy paths -- from the South Asia-meets-New Orleans blues burn of ""Black Saturday"" to ""A Thousand Days Before,"" a snake-hipped meditation on the impermanence of life. Naturally, its centerpiece moment is its heaviest: ""Blood on the Valley Floor,"" where sumptuously evil riffs fall like redwoods as Cornell spools out images of war as mindless decadence. ""The blood dries while we spill,"" he sings. ""Endless summer."" Peter Travers Ranks All 24 James Bond Movies . It's a quintessentially Soundgarden moment: overpowering but self-loathing. What made them ""grunge"" and not just a new kind of old metal was their dire, brutal despair. The band's greatest songs -- miasmic punishers like ""Black Hole Sun"" or ""Fell on Black Days,"" from their 1994 watershed, Superunknown -- undercut massive music with lyrics about helplessness and depression. Being Seattle in the Nineties, that helplessness suggested drug abuse. But ""King Animal"" was recorded by sober dudes in their forties -- the hymnlike ""Bones of Birds"" is about the challenges of parenting, and ""Halfway There"" is a matter-of-fact take on class stagnation: ""Something to eat?/I would say you're doing better than most, though maybe not as well as some,"" Cornell observes. The Best Aerosmith Songs of All Time . That line could describe Cornell's years post-Soundgarden: supergroup success with Tom Morello in Audioslave, then a decade wandering the post-alt-rock solo wilderness, complete with a Timbaland-produced electro-rock puzzler (2009's Scream). After years of failed reinvention, the guy on King Animal sounds content to be himself. ""Don't know where I'm going/I just keep on rowing,"" he moans like a mantra, awash in black swirls of industrial-strength murk on the album's closing track. It's that old-time sludge that carries him home. Review: Neil Young and Crazy Horse .

"(CNN) -- A New York State Supreme Court justice dismissed Friday a defamation lawsuit against Syracuse University and its longtime head basketball coach, Jim Boeheim. The suit was filed in December by two former ball boys for the basketball team, who have accused Bernie Fine, a former assistant coach, of repeated sexual abuse when they were children. Boeheim initially supported Fine, a longtime friend and colleague, accusing Mike Lang and his stepbrother, Bobby Davis, of fabricating their accusations of Fine's alleged misconduct. The coach later apologized for his comments. Justice Brian DeJoseph of the Onondaga County Supreme Court ruled Friday that the initial statements made to media outlets by Boeheim ""were likely to be an opinion -- a biased, passionate, and defensive point of view of a basketball coach -- rather than objective fact. Thus, plaintiff's defamation claim against Boeheim fails as a matter of law."" Kevin Quinn, Syracuse's senior vice president for public affairs, said the university is ""gratified"" by the decision. Gloria Allred, an attorney for Lang and Davis, vowed to appeal. ""It is difficult enough for victims of childhood sexual abuse to come forward. This decision sends the message that you can attack the alleged victim and call him a liar with impunity. It makes it even harder for victims to come forward,"" she said in a statement. Fine was fired from Syracuse in November after the allegations surfaced. He has not been charged with a crime and has maintained his innocence. CNN's Andy Rose contributed to this report.","NEW: Plaintiffs' attorney vows to appeal the decision .

"(CNN) -- Kim Jong Il's passing closes a sad and tragic chapter for the people of North Korea. His 17-year reign will be remembered as a dark period in their history characterized by great suffering and steady and dangerous provocations to the outside world. Though North Korea is an extremely opaque country, we can have some confidence that a transition plan established over a year ago is now being implemented. Public pronouncements from Pyongyang indicate 29-year-old Kim Jong Un has assumed leadership, and preparations are under way for a public funeral for Kim Jong Il, with Kim Jong Un presiding. Even the launch of a short-range missile off North Korea's east coast around the time of Kim's death can be seen as ""North Korean normalcy."" Thus, this is not a time to hyperventilate; rather, we must take a deep breath and give sober-minded examination to the actions we can take to improve the situation on the Korean Peninsula and strengthen our own security. As a former ambassador in the region who worked on North Korea security issues, I am keenly aware that this delicate situation presents immediate risks but also long-term opportunities. The United States should do the following: . We must establish and maintain close channels of communications with our allies to ensure our activities going forward are aligned. First and foremost, we must be in complete lock-step with the South Korean government in Seoul. We also need very close cooperation with Tokyo. We should establish close consultations with other parties with influence in North Korea, including Russia and primarily China. While our interests often diverge, we share with Beijing an aversion to instability and chaos on the Korean Peninsula. At a minimum, we need quality channels of communication with China to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations. For example, if China were to mobilize forces to close her border with North Korea to prevent a massive influx of refugees, it would be important that no one misread those steps as Chinese preparations for sending forces across the border. An immediate priority relates to North Korea's nuclear weapons program. We need solid intelligence to monitor any potential rogue activities or any moves to proliferate, and we must have credible plans to address such activities alongside our allies. Over time, we should work with allies and others to encourage the new regime in Pyongyang to make the wise decision to give up nuclear weapons permanently. We must also monitor Pyongyang's missiles. While North Korea's new leader may continue to flex his muscles with a series of short range missile tests, we cannot forget that North Korea is suspected to have longer range variants of the Taepo Dong missile that may be able to reach Hawaii and Alaska with conventional payloads. And we know the North Koreans have flown a two stage missile over our ally Japan as far back as 1998. Our Aegis ships and those of Japan need to be on alert for the unlikely, but very dangerous possibility, of a missile strike. As we look further ahead, we must note that April 2012 will mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung (Kim Jong Il's father). Our intelligence analysts were already predicting the occasion would likely mean a range of provocative actions from Pyongyang to mark the birth of their country's father and to extract payoffs from the outside world. Now we must add into the dangerous mix the probability that Kim Jong Un will encourage some activities to show his strength and demonstrate that he's firmly in charge. The key going forward will be to help protect our allies and our interests but not to overact to the North Korean regime's predictable pattern of behavior. Looking out over an even longer horizon, we should see Kim's passing as the best opportunity in decades for the people of North Korea to move toward political reform. Whether by supporting Seoul's North-South dialogue, working with Kim Jong Un if he shows any interest in opening-up (not much is known about him, but we do know he had some exposure to the West during his school years) or interacting directly with the people of North Korea, we should seize opportunities to encourage meaningful reform. We should be reminded that after Mao Zedong's death in China in 1976, it took only two years for Deng Xiaoping to launch China's opening to the outside world in 1978. Given the magnitude of these events, wise stewardship of our country and military is essential if we are to take advantage of this opportunity to help forge a more stable situation on the Korean Peninsula. The unpredictable events unfolding in North Korea and across the world should serve as a reminder that we need a president with hands-on foreign policy experience. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jon Huntsman.","Jon Huntsman: Death of Kim Jong Il could lead to more instability .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Pakistani man living in Virginia was sentenced Friday to 12 years in prison for providing material support to the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Jubair Ahmad pleaded guilty in December to making a propaganda video for the group, which included images and a prayer given by the group's leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed. The video also showed ""scenes where atrocities have been inflicted on Muslims, followed by the activities of the mujahideen conducting attacks in Kashmir,"" according to the Justice Department. Recently, the United States announced a $10 million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Saeed, a Pakistani who is suspected of masterminding the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India. which killed 166 people. Ahmad admitted to communicating with someone in Pakistan named Talha Saeed -- Saeed's son -- who asked Ahmad to make the video. Ahmad said he asked Talha Saeed if he wanted to include an image from the Mumbai attacks, but he vetoed that idea. Ahmad uploaded his finished video onto a YouTube account in September 2010. According to court documents, Ahmad, now 24, attended Lashkar-e-Tayyiba training camps as a teenager. In 2007, Ahmad got a visa and he and his family moved from Pakistan to the United States. He has been living in the United States legally, but has not become a citizen. At sentencing, prosecutors said Ahmad conspired to recruit others and to raise money for Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, also know as LeT. The government said Ahmad ""expressed his intention to return to Pakistan to complete the LeT commando training course and be launched on a martyrdom mission."" Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which means army of the pure, is the military wing of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a radical Muslim organization that aims to bring about Islamist rule in parts of India and Pakistan. The United States labeled Lashkar-e-Tayyiba a ""foreign terrorist organization"" in December 2001, and under pressure from Washington, Pakistan banned the group in 2002. However, it continues to function freely. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis ordered that once Ahmad completes his prison term, he will be turned over to immigration officials for removal proceedings. ""Mr. Ahmad directly supported the mission of a designated terrorist organization through his creation of online propaganda, fundraising and recruitment efforts,"" said FBI Assistant Director James McJunkin, who heads the Washington, D.C., field office. ""He is now being held accountable for those actions.""","Jubair Ahmad, 24, pleaded guilty in December to creating a propaganda video .

"Paris (CNN) -- Nicolas Sarkozy may be breathing a bit easier after authorities on Thursday decided not to pursue a formal investigation against the former French president, but rather to treat him as what officials described as a ""witness-under-caution."" The phrase is a technical term that essentially allows a French magistrate to continue to call the former leader to the witness stand in the case over whether L'Oreal cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt and her staff illegally helped him during his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy still faces the possibility of criminal charges stemming from allegedly illicit campaign donations. Read more: Attorney: Sarkozy's home, offices raided .

"(CNN) -- ""I only ever really wanted a break/I've been away for too long,"" Chris Cornell sings on the new Soundgarden album, ""King Animal,"" out November 13. It's the band's first all-new album since 1996's ""Down On the Upside"" and its breakup in 1997, so the lyric feels more like a status report. ""Is it a statement?"" Cornell asked with a laugh. ""Or is it more of a coincidence? Probably more of a coincidence. But it does seem obvious, doesn't it?"" Although Nirvana imploded with Kurt Cobain's death in 1994 and Pearl Jam kept trucking through the 2000s -- celebrating its 20th anniversary last year -- Soundgarden predates both grunge pioneers, even though the band found mainstream popularity only in those bands' wake, hitting a commercial peak in 1994 with the album ""Superunknown."" ""We formed in 1984, eight years before the world knew what Seattle was,"" Cornell said. ""I'm just waiting for the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame to call up and say, 'Here's your induction.' We can do it for the 30th anniversary, I suppose."" Soundgarden's breakup wasn't anything unusual, Cornell said. No one died; no one stole someone's wife. ""No one lost an arm,"" he said. ""It was just time for a break."" Now, after he's explored a different avenue of music with his three solo albums, some Temple of the Dog reunions and Audioslave, the revamped Soundgarden has a new focus, aided by Cornell's sobriety. (He went into rehab after Audioslave's first tour.) Reminded of a post-Soundgarden party where he was spotted double-fisting champagne bottles, the singer laughed. ""Not just one. I needed more than one."" There is one lyrical reference to Soundgarden's time away from the rock arena, but you won't find any other explicit mentions of the band's breakup or of bygone fame on ""King Animal,"" which Cornell said would be ""inappropriate."" ""If this were an Eminem record, he would rap about what it all means, what he thinks about the last record, what he's doing now, and we don't do that,"" Cornell said. ""That's a different culture, to talk about you and then you talk about you some more and then when you're done, how you're selling so many records. I get that, but it's a little strange."" Even though the rock world has changed since the '90s, Cornell says nothing has changed for Soundgarden during the band's time away, which ended in 2010 with some studio sessions, a compilation album (""Telephantasm"") and, most recently, a song on ""The Avengers"" soundtrack (""Live to Rise""). ""I guess if anything, we've reverted back to the way we operated as an indie band,"" Cornell said. ""We acted like free agents. And we can do that now, like we did then, because the music business has changed so much."" Lamenting the loss of importance of music videos and rock radio play, Cornell acknowledged that it wouldn't be quite so easy for a new band to just put out an album and expect any fanfare. Then again, when Soundgarden started out as an indie band -- before becoming the first grunge group to sign to a major label, one year before Nirvana did -- success was based on ""touring in a van and playing little clubs all over the U.S., Canada and Europe, again and again."" (It's a fact that may be acknowledged on the track ""Been Away Too Long"": ""You can walk a million miles and get nowhere."") ""It wouldn't be the same environment if we were just starting out now,"" Cornell said. ""We're an established, well-known band and pioneers of a benchmark cultural shift in rock and pop music, so we have that (in our favor). But all the differences with video play and rock radio networks shrinking keeps you honest, and in a sense, it's healthier and better for fans."" More than ever, Cornell said, Soundgarden wanted to make an album that was consistent with the aesthetic values he developed from listening to bands as a teenager. ""When I was 16 years old and somebody I trusted recommended an album, I would have to go and find it,"" he recalled. ""And oftentimes, those albums weren't easy to find. You might search for a year for it, and then you might have to save up to buy it. And then, if I took it home and didn't love it on the first listen, I would listen to it again and again, because I wanted to like it. I put considerable energy into it."" Likewise, ""King Animal"" can mean different things to different people on subsequent listens. ""It becomes your projection,"" Cornell said. ""Your life is an opera, and this can be the soundtrack of your life."" Listen to ""King Animal"" after Superstorm Sandy in New York, for instance, and someone might sense a storm raging in Cornell's wailings and the band's arrangements and complicated time signatures, how the mood darkens and saddens as each song progresses, drawing the listener deeper into tracks such as ""Bones of Birds,"" the ode to nature ""Taree,"" the water-logged ""Rowing"" and the comfort-seeking ""Black Saturday"" (""I was thirsty, and you gave me water/I was crying, I remember you gave me your shoulder""). Cornell offers minimal explanation for these songs, because he wants fans to come up with their own meanings. ""If I write a song and put it out there, it's not mine anymore,"" he said. ""It takes on a life of its own, and when you listen to it, it becomes your song. And over the course of generations, those meanings will change. I might have created it, but I have no control over how it evolves. But without being able to define what each fan wants, we have to look at it as, Do we like this? We have to please each other, because if we like it, Soundgarden fans will love it. And I think the hardcore fans are going to feel like we brought it. I'm more confident of that now than with any other album.""","Soundgarden's new album, ""King Animal,"" is out November 13 .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- One man died and another was injured after they set themselves on fire Tuesday in Egypt, the latest in a string of self-immolations in restive North Africa, officials told CNN. Ahmed Hashem Sayed set himself on fire in Alexandria and died from his burns, said Dr. Salama Abdel-Menem, Alexandria's health director. Local media reports that Sayed was unemployed. Mohammed Farouq Mohammed, a lawyer, set himself ablaze in Cairo, but is now in stable condition with 5% of his body burned. Dr. Mohameed Yousuf, head of Cairo's Mouneiriya hospital, said the victim will be leaving the hospital within days. Mohammed burned himself in front of the parliament building because his ex-wife refused to allow him to see his daughters, a security source and a medical source at the hospital told CNN. The popular protests in Tunisia that have caused upheaval in the government were sparked by Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate, setting himself on fire in protest. He later died. Now, reports are coming in from other countries in the region -- including Algeria and Mauritania -- that other people are turning to self-immolation, even though it is too soon to know how many of the incidents were sparked by political and social grievances. The Cairo-based Al-Azhar mosque and university, the most respected Sunni Muslim institution in the world, addressed the issue on Tuesday. Spokesman Mohammed Refaa Tahtawi said, ""Islam clearly and broadly forbids committing suicides for any reason and does not permit its followers to kill oneself as an expression of discontent, protest or anger."" In an interview with Egyptian's state-run MENA agency, Tahtawi said al-Azhar doesn't comment on specific cases of people who torch themselves ""because they may be suffering from a mental or psychological condition that forced them to do so, therefore we cannot judge them and we pray for God to forgive them."" Abdo Abelmonem Gafr, a baker from a town outside Cairo, set himself on fire outside the parliament building on Monday, an Interior Ministry official said. Gafr has burns to his face but is alive and not badly hurt, ministry spokesman Alla Mahmood said. In Algeria, security officials said Sunday that three people set themselves on fire. Riots and demonstrations have erupted in Algeria in recent days. News reports out of Mauritania say a man set himself on fire Monday in front of the presidential palace. The reports identify the man as Yacoub Dahoud, who posted a Facebook message praising Bouazizi and vowing, ""We will never forget you."" Mauritanian media said Dahoud started a Facebook group called ""Stop the corruption and tyranny in Mauritania."" In a statement on the page, Dahoud wrote, ""Isn't it the time for the Mauritanian people to choose their freedom?"" Blake Hounshell of the foreignpolicy.com blog, wrote on Monday that the attempts are a ""shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy."" Bouazizi had set himself ablaze outside a government building in the Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. The cart was his only means of income. Buddhist monks famously took to self-immolation in protest against the Vietnam War. ""Of all the dramatic photographs to come out of the Vietnam War, the first to shock the world was of a Buddhist monk in flames,"" journalist Tim Larimer wrote for Time magazine in 1999. At Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 2001, five people lit themselves on fire in front of a CNN crew. One died. A police report identified them as members of the banned Falun Gong movement. But Falun Gong denied any connection to that incident, saying what transpired had ""nothing to do with Falun Gong practitioners.""

Vonn is 167 points behind leader Tina Maze of Slovenia, who followed up her Friday with with second place ahead of another U.S. skier, Julia Mancuso, on a course shortened due to poor visibility. It was Vonn's 57th World Cup race victory, the second best tally in women's alpine racing, and her 20th in a discipline that she has dominated for the past four years. She is now third overall, four points behind Germany's Maria Hofl-Riesch, as she battles back after her early season was hit by a serious stomach ailment that put her in hospital. Last year Vonn won her fourth World Cup title ahead of Maze and Hofl-Riesch. ""I was really disappointed yesterday after the super-combined and I knew there were some who could go really fast in super-G like Tina and Julia,"" Vonn, who won all three races at Lake Louise in Canada last weekend, told reporters. ""I am just happy to get another win. I lost three races when I was ill in mid-November and I have had to battle my way back.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Reality for TLC's T-Boz has been a challenge, starting at age 7, when she was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. ""I was told I wouldn't live past 30, I would be disabled my whole life and I would never become a mother,"" T-Boz, a member of one of the most successful girl groups ever, told CNN. ""My daughter is Chase. She's 12. I've traveled the world in one of the best groups ever. I'm 42."" Reality called again five years ago when doctors found a brain tumor, which left her partially blind and deaf. ""But after losing my sight, hearing, balance and speech, yes, I'm returning,"" said T-Boz, whose real name is Tionne Watkins. ""I had to take three years to heal and fight for everything that I wanted back. T-Boz is sharing the lessons learned from hard reality in a reality TV show that premieres Tuesday night, coincidentally on a network with the same name as her group -- TLC. ""It's about 20 years later, me coming back from the brain tumor and doing things I want to do,"" she said. ""You'll hear about all that in the show, my real-life struggles, being a single mother. I don't care how much money you have in the world. It's not about that. It's all about time. I'm in charge of raising a young woman one day, to be a mother and hopefully a wife. All of that. As you know, being a parent, that's probably the hardest job ever"" ""Totally T-Boz"" is real -- especially compared with most shows, she said: ""They're fake as all get-out, right? I'm real."" Her experience with reality TV includes being fired by Donald Trump on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2009. ""If I'm not the chick you want, because you don't want that, then they'll probably censure me,"" she said. ""That's fine, but I'm staying me, because I'm happy and I've always been happy in my skin."" Like other entertainers who disappear from the spotlight for a while, T-Boz never stopped working while she focused on raising her daughter and fighting for her health. ""I get a lot of 'Oh, you've been gone,'"" she said. ""I wasn't gone. Just because you didn't see me doesn't mean I wasn't working and collecting checks. I just wasn't singing and doing videos. I do a lot of other things, like I said, like writing scripts and stuff like that. I write for other artists."" When a doctor told her that her headaches were caused by a tumor, ""I said 'Say huh? Say huh?"" she said. The diagnosis triggered a string of emotions, but never anger, she said. ""I had that fight,"" she said. ""I want to live. I didn't have time to die."" The hardest time was not knowing if the tumor was cancerous and if it would kill her, she said. She began a desperate search for doctors she trusted who did not look at her ""just like I was a dollar sign,"" she said. ""They're like, 'You know, sickle cell can cause complications because it will turn on your body, your heart and lungs. You could just die, have a stroke,"" she said. ""I was like, Jesus, Lord, what's going on?"" Some doctors told her removing her tumor through surgery would be too complicated. ""It's just like they wanted to still keep the tumor in my head, and maybe burn some of your cells and you may not remember something."" ""In my gut, I know if I had stayed in Atlanta, and let them touch me, I wouldn't be here,"" she said. ""I wasn't going to make it through those surgeries. I was going to die. And I felt that."" She chose a Los Angeles doctor to oversee her treatment and brain surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ""I said, 'I know this is him in my heart,"" she said. ""I packed up my stuff and my family and I came here."" But she had to make a decision. ""I had to give the order of what I wanted to be saved,"" she said. ""So I said my face first, because you couldn't look at me and tell I'm deaf or blind. My hearing second, because I still want to hear and sing and have my speech. And then my balance. So they took my balance completely from the right."" But after three years of physical therapy to teach her brain how to compensate for the loss of balance, ""mostly everything else is back. I can hear and see and I can speak,"" she said. ""So I am blessed."" When you meet her now, it's hard now to tell anything was ever wrong with T-Boz. ""I still have a crooked smile and just certain things I deal with, but I'll take all of that to be back here and be Chase's mother,"" she said. Predictions of her lifespan are still pessimistic, but her optimism rejects them. ""Now they're saying 45, and I plan to be talking to y'all at 56,"" she said. ""I'd rather take over the disease than let it take over me. Let's put it that way."" T-Boz has a lot left to do. This year is the 20th anniversary of when she teamed with Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes and Rozonda ""Chilli"" Thomas as TLC. VH1 is producing a bio-pic about them, which means T-Boz is back in the studio working on the soundtrack. ""It's going to be hard to see who can dance like us,"" she said. ""I don't even think I could do me again. Could I do T-Boz again the way I did it?""

"New York (CNN) -- They never got to run their race because of Superstorm Sandy, but ING New York City Marathon entrants can now at least recoup their entry fee, organizers of the marquee 26-mile test of human endurance said Thursday. Citing ""extraordinary circumstances,"" the New York Road Runners organization is offering runners the option of getting a full refund of their entry fee. Entry fees for the canceled 2012 race varied from $216 for members of the New York Road Runners and $255 for non-members to $347 for runners from outside the United States. The refund offer exclude an $11 processing fee, race organizers said. Race organizers also offered two other options -- a guaranteed place in the always-crowded field for the New York Marathon one year during the next three years, or guaranteed entry into the NYC Half Marathon in March. But in those cases, runners would not get back their fees for this year's race and they would have to pay fees for whichever future race they chose. Runners vented frustrations about the latter two options on the marathon's Facebook page, complaining that they unfairly created a one-race-for-two-fees deal. Meanwhile, John Shostrom,captain of the Brooklyn Road Runners, told CNN the offers by marathon organizers gave runners ""a decent range of options to choose from."" The situation is ""really good for people who are leaning toward option one (refund of 2012 entry fee)."" Shostrom, a copy editor for Sports Illustrated, said Thursday. But the other two options make for ""an income maximizer for the Road Runners in terms of all those people who feel like they really have to do another race ... it's a way of getting double payment for one actual race."" Whichever options runners choose, a considerable total amount of money is involved. For the 2011 New York City Marathon, more than 47,000 runners paid their fees and pounded the pavements on a 26.2-mile course that snaked through all five of the city's boroughs. The 2012 marathon, scheduled for November 4,was canceled for the first time in its history so as not to draw resources and attention away from the response to Superstorm Sandy, which had blasted the New York and New Jersey areas only days before. By the scheduled race day, many areas were still without electricity and thousands of people were in need of aid. Just as the cancellation marked a first for the marathon in its 42-year history, race organizers pointed out that the refund offer also was a first. ""We started with the premise that despite (organizers') no-refund policy, we needed to be able to offer runners that choice. Beyond that, we wanted to make sure they had as full options to run again as possible,"" Mary Wittenberg, president and CEO of New York Road Runners told CNN in an e-mail. Wittenberg said while race organizers would have liked to have offered waived entry fees for other events, ""we couldn't do that protect our other races and running programs."" Runners have until January 25 to choose an option.","The New York City Marathon was canceled in the wake of Superstorm Sandy .

"(CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande restated his country's support for debt-stricken Greece Saturday, but stressed that it must live up to its reform commitments. Hollande spoke alongside Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras in Paris, following the first meeting between the two leaders since their respective elections this summer. Hollande said there was ""no question"" that Greece should remain in the eurozone, the 17-nation single currency area, and that two-and-a-half years of speculation over its potential exit should end. But, he said, Greece has to meet its reform targets. ""Greece must stay in the eurozone and then again demonstrate credibility in its program, as well as the will of its leaders to get through this process and to make sure it is bearable for its people,"" he said. Hollande also recognized the efforts already made by Greece, whose people have had to endure painful austerity measures and five years of recession. Samaras, elected three months ago, is on a two-day visit to Germany and France as he seeks to negotiate some breathing room for his debt-burdened government. The meeting with Hollande had been a chance to discuss ""the big threats, the big challenges but also the common prospects that Europe is facing,"" Samaras said. He reiterated his government's resolve to take the steps needed to keep Greece afloat. ""There are those who are speculating that Greece will not make it. I am here to reassure the French president that Greece is, today, determined to make it. And will make it,"" he said. ""It will do what it takes to get out of the crisis and will remain, as the French president also said, in the eurozone and once again find its rightful role in Europe."" Success by Greece will help show that Europe can ""overcome its problems and, united, go forward,"" he said. Samaras agreed that structural reforms were needed but stressed too the importance of development, saying that without it the economy would struggle to recover from recession. He added that the Greeks are a proud people, who ""don't like to borrow and depend on borrowed money,"" a point he also made after his talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Friday. Greece's international lenders, known as the troika, are due to complete a report on the country's finances next month, on which rests Athens' continued access to international bailout funds. Greece has been at the center of Europe's long-running debt crisis, which is now threatening to envelop Spain and Italy and has shaken the global financial system. Even after a historic restructuring in March, Greece is still struggling to cope with a punishing debt load as its economy remains mired in a years-long recession. Many investors and economists believe there is at least a 50% chance that Greece will leave the currency union, or be forced out, this year. However, speaking Friday in Berlin, Merkel said she was ""absolutely convinced"" that Samaras and his partners in Greece's coalition government were doing everything they could to solve the nation's economic problems. The chancellor said twice that she wanted Greece to remain a member of the euro currency union. But she also argued that the euro crisis stemmed from a lack of trust, which she said must be rebuilt. ""I have made clear today that we absolutely expect from Greece that the promises which were made will also be kept, and implemented,"" said Merkel. ""That actions will follow their promises."" Greece is widely believed to have gone off-track with its program following the political turmoil of this year's elections, which left the nation without a fully functioning government for weeks. However, Samaras and his coalition partners have reportedly identified the roughly â‚¬11 billion in additional budget cuts that it needs to secure the latest installment of bailout money. Troika officials are set to return to Athens in early September to complete their review. That means eurozone finance ministers will probably not make a decision on Greece's bailout money until they meet on October 8. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Pierre Meilhan, Christine Theodorou and journalist Elinda Labopoulou contributed to this report.","Francois Hollande says Greece must ""demonstrate credibility"" in its commitment to reform .

"(CNN) -- You may not have noticed it because of that helmet he had to wear while free-falling into the history books, but Felix Baumgartner is kind of hot. Yes, yes, we know that sounds incredibly superficial, but these things are important when considering who should be cast to play Baumgartner in a movie about his record-breaking leap. Because honestly, you know someone, somewhere, is already trying to figure out how to turn it into a film. And we want to offer an assist. Here are just a few of the Hollywood hunks who come to mind: . David Beckham - You can kind of see it, right? Rugged jaw line, stubble, the hard athletic body from hours of training for a death-defying feat. And a vocal coach could be brought in to help Beckham learn an Austrian accent. Channing Tatum - Four words for you: ""Magic Mike in space."" Need we say more? And in the interest of creative license, the ""Step It Up"" star could land on his feet after the jump and break into a celebratory dance. Alex Pettyfer - Speaking of ""Magic Mike,"" Tatum's co-star in that film could also make an interesting daredevil. And in an interview he reportedly said he is a ""fan of fear"" -- and Baumgartner's feat was definitely a scary one. Michael Pitt - There was a huge outcry when Pitt's character was killed off in HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" so we know he has a fan base. He's also a pretty intense actor and could probably pull this one off with ease. Jonathan Rhys Meyers - The actor has been missed since his star turn in the now ended Showtime series ""The Tudors."" He has range, having convincingly portrayed everyone from King Henry VIII to the king of rock and roll, Elvis, so why not? Sam Rockwell - He plays a lunatic in ""Seven Psychopaths"" and we'd like to see him get a break from often playing the heavy. He's had smaller roles in films like ""The Green Mile"" and ""Iron Man 2,"" and a lead would be nice. Ryan Reynolds - Because he is Ryan Reynolds, and any opportunity to have more of Ryan Reynolds we will take. Who would you throw into the mix as a possible Baumgartner? Sound off below.","Felix Baumgartner broke a world record Sunday when he jumped from 24 miles above the Earth .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Questlove remembers the moment he called D'Angelo and asked him to make his first U.S. concert appearance in 12 years on June 9th, for the drummer's late-night Super Jam at Bonnaroo. ""I said, 'It will be a whole night doing what we used to do at Electric Lady in the Nineties,'"" Questlove tells Rolling Stone. ""'Playing the Funkadelic catalog and seeing what we get, the Prince catalog, Hendrix, the Meters.' He said, 'Go ahead.' And once he said, 'Go ahead,' I was like, 'I got you now.'"" During the live jam session, D'Angelo surprised the crowd by grooving with Funkadelic singer Kendra Foster during a funky cover of the Beatles' ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window"" and shredding guitar on Jimi Hendrix's ""Power of Soul."" ""He's elated,"" Questlove says. ""He was just amazed. I wanted him to see how loved he really is because he really doesn't get it. He seriously doesn't watch television. He's not on a computer at all. He's still listening to vinyl, cassettes and a Discman."" The Roots drummer hopes the appearance will convince D'Angelo to finally release his first LP since 2000's ""Voodoo."" Questlove says roughly 30 tracks have been recorded over the last few years, with many sessions taking place at Electric Lady in New York, where the singer cut Voodoo. ""He is about to take a radical 180 turn with this record,"" says Questlove. ""It's going to throw people off the same way that Prince's Dirty Mind threw his R&B fanbase off. In the past few years, he's discovered Bowie and Zeppelin, the Beatles, Pet Sounds, Captain Beefheart and Zappa. ""My whole reasoning for doing [Bonnaroo],"" Questlove says, ""was to show him who his real audience is."" On the upcoming album, fans will also hear a new side of the singer: as a guitarist. ""I saw a guitar in the studio, and I was like, 'What the hell's this?'"" Questlove remembers. ""One night, when he didn't know I was watching, he took a dinner break from recording. Suddenly, I heard [Funkadelic's] 'Maggot Brain' playing. I realized he was in the studio room matching it note-for-note. For the last 12 years, he's been strumming the guitar ... He is so painfully shy about it. I think in his head, if he doesn't surpass Eddie Hazel, Santana, James Blood Ulmer and Frank Zappa as an axeman, he doesn't want to share it with the world."" D'Angelo has also been creating his own keyboard sounds for the album. ""He's very particular about his patches,"" Questlove adds. ""I've never heard these sounds before. He'll take an ordinary sound and he'll filter it through a guitar processor. He'll take that particular sound and put some wave envelope noise on it, and he'll put it back in the keyboard, and that's his sound. There's a song we worked on called 'The Charade.' There's this symphonic trombone sound, which normally would be a cheesy sound Swizz Beatz uses. But he'll take that sound and then put it through a guitar filter and put it back in the keyboard and then put it through another filter. It's totally unique."" Fans should expect to hear some of the new songs during an appearance at New Orleans Essence Festival on July 6th. Questlove says the goal is to release the LP around August. ""Nothing is official --- it is year 12,"" he laughs. ""I'm just hoping that this was enough fire to really make him do that. Because we spoke the day after [Bonnaroo] and he said, 'I'm so happy.' I said, 'Now you just turn in your damn record. Just finish. Just turn it in. Let your children go already."" See the full story at RollingStone.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two influential U.S. senators introduced a resolution Tuesday expressing support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya -- part of an effort to counter rising pressure in the House of Representatives to withdraw backing for the mission. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner proposed two resolutions on the Libya mission that could come up for votes on Thursday. One would be the same as the Senate resolution introduced Tuesday, and the other would limit U.S. involvement in the mission to a noncombat role while allowing many of the same functions being performed now by U.S. forces to continue. The House proposal seeking a noncombat role reflects frustration in Congress over what Boehner and others call President Barack Obama's failure to get necessary congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution for engaging U.S. forces in the Libya military campaign. ""If the Commander-in-Chief believes that intervention in Libya is important for our national security, he has a responsibility to make a case for it -- clearly and publicly -- and seek authorization,"" Boehner said in a statement announcing the two proposed House resolutions. ""In the three months since military action in Libya began, none of this has occurred. The American people deserve to have their voice heard in this debate, and Congress has a responsibility to hold the White House accountable."" The Senate resolution, introduced by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry and Arizona Republican John McCain, authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops. ""I believe the president did the right thing by intervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster,"" McCain said.  ""I believe we will find a strong, bipartisan majority that is in favor of authorizing our current military operations in Libya and seeing this mission through to success."" Kerry added, ""By supporting this resolution, we tell Arabs young and old that the United States is willing to make tough decisions and spend our tax dollars to help ensure your freedom."" The allied military effort, which already has formal U.N. support, was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the North African country's longtime ruler, Moammar Gadhafi. Western leaders have made clear, however, that they believe the mission cannot be successfully completed without Gadhafi's ouster. The Obama administration has already promised not to use U.S. ground troops, but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting. An unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war Democrats and conservative Republicans worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance. One of the House resolutions under consideration will be the same as the McCain-Kerry proposal that supports the current limited U.S. role in the mission, Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. A House GOP leadership source said the measure is expected to be defeated. The second House resolution would remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Libya, except for those engaged in nonhostile actions including search and rescue; aerial refueling; operational planning; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and noncombat missions. While the resolution would be nonbinding, its approval by the House would signal strong opposition to Obama's decision to commit U.S. forces without seeking authorization from Congress. A House leadership aide said the second resolution is aimed at U.S. military drones and any other combat role by U.S. forces in Libya, and is likely to pass in the Republican-controlled chamber. House Republicans will meet Wednesday to further discuss the issue, and GOP leaders were not ruling out possible changes or additions to the resolutions. Critics contend the 1973 War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities. The combined 90-day period ended Sunday. Support for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by Gadhafi's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes.  NATO officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition. The White House argues the president didn't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and haven't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities. Obama, however, personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, according to a Saturday report in The New York Times. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses. Reid said Tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the McCain-Kerry resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the Senate floor. He indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week. McConnell, meanwhile, told reporters that ""we all anticipate that there will be some kind of Libya debate in the Senate in the near future."" McCain has expressed anger that the White House didn't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war. The senator, who ran against Obama in 2008, contends a resolution of support would have passed easily when NATO first intervened. ""The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive,"" McCain said Tuesday. ""The unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full-scale revolt ... that is occurring in the House of Representatives."" The House is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week, and liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission. However, that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the House returns from its Fourth of July recess. To prevent a similar resolution from Kucinich from passing earlier, Boehner pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send Congress information justifying the U.S. strategy in Libya. Obama responded with a 32-page report arguing in part that he has not violated the War Powers Resolution. Even if the Republican-controlled House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission, it is unlikely the Senate would do the same. ""The president's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya, but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down,"" conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Obama ""needs to step up his game with Libya, but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi,"" Graham argued. In March, the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no-fly zone over Libya. Some Republicans, however, have now expressed opposition to that effort, citing growing concerns about its cost. In its report on the mission, the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $800 million. It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $1.1 billion. Questions about the war's financial and other costs have also been raised in the United Kingdom, which has played a leading role in the NATO effort. British Prime Minister David Cameron insists that Britain's military involvement in the North African country can continue ""as long as we need."" CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Dan Lothian, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: The House may consider a resolution limiting U.S. role to noncombat activities .

"(CNN) -- U.S. star Mikaela Shiffrin produced a stunning slalom run to claim her first ever World Cup race victory at Are, Sweden on Thursday. The 17-year-old clocked the fastest aggregate time over two legs to see off home favorite Frida Hansdotter and championship leader Tina Maze of Slovenia. The teenager, racing in the absence of leading American Lindsey Vonn, finished with a combined time of one minute 45.36 seconds to stun her opponents. Shiffrin, who came home 00.29 seconds ahead of Hansdotter, had trailed after the first leg before roaring back to claim top spot. ""I'll need for some time to be able to take this in,"" Shiffrin, who did not finish Wednesday's giant slalom, told reporters. ""I really enjoyed myself out there. I just tried to fly and sometimes it is easier like that. I will need to calm myself down before the next race at Semmering.""

Right now I just need to calm down and regroup."" Maze, who was forced to settle for third place, was more than happy with her performance as she continued to dominate the overall standings. She said: ""The second leg was very fast and I am happy with that performance before Christmas and a little break that I feel I need. I gave everything I had today and it worked out well."" Maze sits top of the overall table on 919 points with Germany's Maria Hofl-Riesch second with 532 points and Kathrin Zettel of Austria third on 466 points.

"Beijing (CNN) -- You can see them each night on street corners or public squares of Beijing, hundreds of Chinese couples ballroom dancing to music blaring from makeshift speakers. Some have this down to a fine art, twirling and sweeping across the pavement. This is entertainment for the armies of migrant workers who have flocked to China's cities over the past 20 years on the promise of a better life. For so many of them the dream has come true. China's breakneck economic growth -- inspired by former leader Deng Xiaoping's call ""to get rich is glorious"" -- has turned one time peasant farmers into factory hands, construction workers, sales people and shop assistants. Some have indeed become rich starting companies or riding the property boom. For the Communist Party, the country's unelected supreme leaders, this is the source of their legitimacy and authority: keep the engines of growth turning, and the people busy and prosperous. It has worked, so far. But strains are appearing. The gap between rich and poor is widening and the economy itself is weakening. The growth figures for the latest quarter are at 7.4 %, the slowest in three years. China's GDP growth slides to 7.4% . As the party prepares for its leadership change in November, it is also faced with reforming an economy that can longer rely on cheap labor, high exports and big investment. It needs to switch to domestic consumption - no easy task, according to some analysts. ""It will take generation to get to remodel that growth formula. It is easier said than done, to make sure that people feel that they are safe to spend,"" says Victor Chu, chairman of First Eastern Investment Group. Chu has faith in China's leaders -- they have more tools in their box than the rest of the world, he says. Other big thinkers in the world of business agree. Faced with the potential of a ""hard landing"" of plummeting growth, many foresee a ""soft landing"" -- a controlled slowdown leading to more quality growth. ""The last 10 years developed a very good track record of economic management,"" says John Quelch, dean of the China Europe International Business School. ""Obviously there are global challenges affecting the China growth path. China needs to rebalance towards domestic consumption, but I'm pretty confident that the quality of the management in Beijing, financially speaking, is very very good."" As the world's second biggest economy -- and many economists predict that one day, not far away, China is destined to overtake the United States at number one -- what happens here is now felt around the world. It's become a hot button issue during the U.S election campaign. Candidates Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have used the presidential debates to try to ""out-tough"" each other on China. China is accused of not playing fair, keeping its currency low to gain an export advantage and taking American jobs. If elected, Governor Romney says he would declare China a ""currency manipulator"" on the first day of his presidency. President Obama says he's lodged successful cases against China at the World Trade Organization. U.S. debate: Tough talk on China . China's Foreign Ministry has hit back, saying that U.S politicians need to treat China fairly and that trade should be a win-win. Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP, does a lot of business in China. He says the rest of the world can't blame Beijing for its ills. ""We have mismanaged our economy, not the Chinese,"" Sorrell says. ""Look back in the history, we've been here before, early 19th Century, China and India were 40-50% of worldwide GNP. They are going be again ... the only question is when."" But economists point out China's leaders should be under no illusions about the task ahead. The gap between rich and poor is widening, and poor Chinese complain that the opportunities are drying up. Then there are questions about social cohesion, the rule of law and human rights. In many ways China's incoming rulers are in a race against time. Reform the economy before the people turn against the Party. ""The whole legitimacy of this one party rule depends on the ability to deliver. And in the last 30 years, hundreds of million have been brought above the poverty line. So going forward is going to be challenging, but the only way they can survive is to deliver,"" warns Victor Chu. Tonight the ball room dancers will be back on the streets, but the question remains what will become of them if the music stops.","China's explosive growth is slowing as economy expands at lowest level in three years .

"(Financial Times) -- Idan Ofer, Israel's richest man, is relocating to London in a move likely to inflame debate about unfettered wealth and inequality in his country. Mr Ofer, 57, who has an estimated net worth of $6.5bn, is making the move for what an associate said were personal reasons. His mother lives in London and his son recently left the Israeli army and plans to study abroad, possibly in the UK. ""There are a number of family reasons which mean it makes sense for him to spend more time in London than he has previously and make that more of a base,"" a person close to the Israeli billionaire told the Financial Times on Monday. Through Quantum Pacific Group, Mr Ofer is controlling shareholder in Israel Corp, the country's largest holding company, which has interests in turn in container shipping, automotive, energy, and the fertiliser company Israel Chemicals. Potash Corp of Canada hopes to acquire the latter in what would be the biggest business deal in Israeli history. Like Israel's other ""tycoons"", he has suffered a beating from the Israeli media and in public opinion since the 2011 social protests, when hundreds of thousands of middle-class citizens demonstrated against high living costs and an economy largely controlled by a few rich family conglomerates. In January's election, new politicians such as Yair Lapid, finance minister, rose to power on promises to help the middle class at a time when Israel needs to cut spending and raise taxes to close a growing budget deficit. Shelly Yachimovich, leader of the left-wing Labour party, singled out Mr Ofer for criticism in her campaign. The Israeli business magnate has long owned property and spent some of his time in London. If he were to qualify for non-domicile tax status, income from his offshore companies will not count towards his tax bill in the UK. Associates pointed out that Mr Ofer had longstanding personal and business ties in Britain. The family shipping business, co-owned with his brother Eyal -- who is based in Monaco -- runs the largest fleet of British-flagged ships in the world, and there is a wing at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich named after their father Sammy. This year has seen wealthy foreigners including Andrei Borodin, the Russian bank chairman, and executives from LVMH and Dassault Systems relocate to London. On the Forbes list of billionaires, Mr Ofer ranks number 182, with an estimated net worth of $6.5bn.

"Los Angeles  (CNN) -- Actor Wesley Snipes said he was nervous about going to jail on Thursday, but was hopeful that his prayers would be answered. ""We still have prayers out there. We still believe in miracles. So don't send me up the river yet,"" Snipes said in an interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Tuesday night. The 48-year-old actor will report to McKean Federal Correctional Institution in Lewis Run, Pennsylvania, Thursday to begin serving a three-year sentence for failing to file tax returns. Snipes' attorney said he is appealing Snipes' misdemeanor convictions for not filing tax returns in 1999, 2000 and 2001. Snipes was acquitted of felony charges. The actor conceded he was uneasy about losing his freedom if his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court fails. ""I think any man would be nervous if his liberty is at stake,"" Snipes said. ""I'm disappointed that the system seems not to be working for me in this situation."" Prosecutors said Snipes earned $40 million since 1999 but had filed no returns and had been involved in a tax resisters group. Snipes disputed such involvement and said that the failure to file was his advisers' fault. ""This is another thing that has been misreported: It has been framed that I was a conspirator and that I was an architect in a scheme by an organization that has been characterized as tax protesters,"" Snipes said. ""The press hasn't reported that I was a client of people who I trusted [who] had knowledge and expertise in the areas of tax law that would protect my interests."" Snipes is best known for his roles in the ""Blade"" action films, the comedy film ""White Men Can't Jump"" and the drama ""Jungle Fever."" Last February, a jury convicted Snipes on the misdemeanor charges, but he was acquitted of more serious felony charges of tax fraud and conspiracy. Jurors accepted his argument that he was innocently duped by errant tax advisers. Defense attorneys in court documents suggested that to sentence Snipes harshly would be to disregard the jury's verdict. But prosecutors, in their sentencing recommendation, said the jurors' decision ""has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a 'victory' for Snipes. The troubling implication of such coverage for the millions of average citizens who are aware of this case is that the rich and famous Wesley Snipes has 'gotten away with it.' In the end the criminal conduct of Snipes must not be seen in such a light."" Snipes suggested he was unfairly singled out by prosecutors. ""It does seem to be rather unusual and rather bizarre when you had a prosecutor come into the sentencing and say that this is the biggest tax trial in the history of the IRS,"" Snipes said. ""I think there is a certain amount of selectivity going on here."" Snipes indicated he was disturbed by some public comments that he was receiving ""just punishment."" ""It's been presented as though I'm worthy of this punishment,"" Snipes said. ""I've been a law-abiding citizen ever since I grew up in the Bronx, New York."" One juror, Frank Tuttle, gave Larry King Live a written statement that three other jurors had made up their mind that Snipes was guilty before the trial began. The jury's verdict was a compromise between those jurors who thought Snipes was guilty and those who didn't, Tuttle said in the statement. ""That's when a deal was made to find him guilty on the failure to file taxes and not guilty on the federal tax evasion charges,"" Tuttle said in the statement. ""We did not think he would go to jail."" Snipes' attorney, Daniel R. Meachum, said neither he nor Snipes had any involvement in preparing that juror's statement to Larry King Live, saying the show's producers obtained it on their own. ""We on the defense team never suggested that the media reach out to any of the jurors,"" Meachum said. Snipes contended that some media accounts of his trial have distorted public perceptions. ""There have been some egregious and very malicious efforts to report the facts of this case,"" Snipes said. ""I was never charged with tax evasion. I've never been a tax protester."" Snipes said he has paid his taxes. ""They claimed that there was a certain number that was owed and that number has been all over that place. The press has escalated it and changed it a number of times. But we think we are fully complaint with what was owed,"" Snipes said. ""Not did I pay but my position is that I always paid.""","Wesley Snipes was convicted of misdemeanors for not filing tax returns for 3 years .

"(CNN) -- Brandi Fernandez, interim district attorney for Kaufman County, is a very capable and competent prosecutor, one of the Texas county's top elected officials says. Fernandez, who was the top assistant before Mike McLelland and his wife were slain in their home, has worked for the department for the past nine years. County Judge Bruce Wood called her a very capable attorney. Fernandez has earned a reputation as a tough opponent for defense lawyers. ""She definitely knows what she's doing,"" Wade Gent, a criminal defense attorney from Kaufman told CNN Dallas affiliate WFAA. ""For the most part, she's by the book, no-nonsense and will do the job. I have no doubt she is capable of handling the pressure; Brandi is very experienced, very dedicated."" Another defense attorney told the Dallas Morning News that Fernandez was a ""beast."" ""She strikes fear in some people's hearts,"" Eric Smenner told the paper, adding that she was tougher to negotiate plea deals with than other prosecutors, but that compromise wasn't impossible. Fernandez, 42, was the lead prosecutor in a case against a member of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, the Kaufman Herald reported in August. James Patrick Crawford was found guilty on six charges in connection with what the paper called a gang-related shooting in 2011. She has worked at the DA's office since 2004, according to a bio released by the agency. She was picked by the late McLelland to be the first assistant district attorney when he took office in 2010, a post she also held from 2004 to 2006. Before that, Fernandez was an assistant district attorney for the 106th Judicial District Attorney's Office in north Texas. Fernandez graduated from Texas Tech University School of Law in 1996. She was a member of the board of barristers and national mock trial team. She will serve as interim DA until Gov. Rick Perry picks a successor.","Brandi Fernandez has worked for Kaufman County for nine years .

"(CNN) -- More than 28,000 people have died in drug violence in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006 and stepped up the fight against organized crime, the nation's intelligence and national security director said Tuesday. In addition, said Guillermo Valdes Castellanos, Mexican authorities and drug gang members have been engaged in 963 gun battles in that time period, or about one per day. The large number of confrontations show that the government is taking the fight to the drug cartels, which previously operated with impunity, Valdes said. Calderon said in April that more than 22,700 people had died in drug violence since he took office. The Mexican attorney general's office said a few weeks ago the death toll for the same time period stood at 24,826. ""Calderon and party probably never thought it would get this high,"" said Samuel Logan, founding director of Southern Pulse Networked Intelligence, an online information network focused on Latin America. ""The acceleration year to year is an indication that things are likely to get worse before they get better. We are still on that footing."" Still, Logan cautioned that 90 percent to 95 percent on the fatalities are ""bad guy versus bad guy."" The latest tallies were revealed at a summit Calderon held Tuesday called ""Dialog for Security, Evaluation and Strengthening."" The president and other high functionaries, academics and security experts met in Mexico City and sat around a large table, calmly discussing the bloody struggle for control of the nation. They painted it as a matter of regaining control and rooting out corruption. Around the same time, firefights broke out in Reynosa, a city in the border state of Tamaulipas. Residents there sat around their computers and posted comments on Twitter about the violence outside their doors. ""Shootouts, chases & several blocked highways in Reynosa,"" wrote Sergio Chapa, a reporter at KGBT-TV in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, who covers the border region. Said a Twitter user who identified herself as DianaOlga, ""Reynosa is in chaos at this moment there is no nextel, the streets are closed you can only hear the bullets."" Another person noted that his father had been shot and he was leaving for Reynosa first thing in the morning. Many residents posted photos of blocked roads or people taking refuge during a gun battle. Tamaulipas has seen some of the most violent atrocities since January, when the Gulf and Zetas cartels went to war. The Zetas used to be the armed enforcers for the Gulf Cartel but broke away over a gang member assassination and other matters. Scared residents weren't the only ones tweeting about the violence Tuesday. The city government also took to the web to warn citizens. ""Blockades on 20th Street, Soriana Blvd., Morelos, Gemelos Bridge, Libramiento Chedraui. Take precautions until new information,"" the city government said. About a half-hour earlier the Reynosa government had posted a tweet that said, "" RISKY SITUATION continues in VARIOUS POINTS IN THE CITY. It is convenient to PROTECT YOURSELF. Blockades to be confirmed."" Earlier Tuesday, an explosive device blew up at an open air market in the city, causing damage to structures but no casualties. At his summit Tuesday, Calderon said the violence could persist ""for a while among us."" That wasn't welcome news to any Mexicans. But neither was it particularly surprising, especially to those in battleground areas. While the politicians talked in Mexico City, a twitterer who goes by the name of AnnyGirl1 summed up her day. ""A sad case, when I thought that things were calming in Reynosa, we woke up to a grenade attack and then 12 hours later a shootout.""","The new tallies were revealed at a summit called by President Felipe Calderon .

"(CNN) --   Some athletes earn the right to be considered a sporting legend. Few, in truth, are truly deserving of such an honor. But there can be no quarrel over the greatness of Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie who, in a career spanning 16 years, has redefined the art of long-distance running. Haile Gebrselassie during the epic 10,000 meter final at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. It is regularly described as one of the greatest track races of all time. Born in the rural town of Asela in the central province of Arsi, Haile Gebrselassie was seven years old when the Ethiopian Miruts Yifter triumphed in the 10,000 meters final at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Listening to the victory on the family radio the feat implanted not only a desire to run, but also a belief that it was possible for Ethiopian athletes to succeed at the highest level. Gebrselassie soon took up running. Poor transport services in Ethiopia necessitated that he regularly run 10 kilometers to school and back with his books tucked under his left arm. When he began to run competitively -- he won his first 1500 meter race at primary school when he was eight years old -- he ran with a crooked arm, as if the books were still there. But the bent arm didn't hinder him and it has remained a distinctive feature of his running style ever since. Spurred on by his physical education teacher, Gebrselassie started training after school. Extra sessions running around his father's farm soon reaped rewards as he began to win not only local but regional races. When he was 15 years old, he and his brother joined an athletics club in Addis Ababa and tried to make the national team. The young Gebrselassie's devotion to running initially annoyed his father, who implored his son to forge a career as a doctor or a teacher, but he kept up his training schedule and the more he practiced, the faster he got. In 1992, the same year he met his future wife Alem, a 19 year-old Gebrselassie won the 5,000 and 10,000 meter finals at the World Junior Athletic Championships. The following season his senior career would take off in spectacular fashion. At the World Athletics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany he claimed the 10,000 meter title. The following year he broke his first world record -- 5,000 meters at a meet in Hengelo, Holland -- surpassing the time set by the Moroccan Said Aouita seven years earlier. 1995 produced further extraordinary success. Not only did Gebrselassie retain his World 10,000 meter crown -- he would eventually win four -- but he clocked three world records in just 71 days. Still only 23 years old, his fledgling career reached its pinnacle when he won the 10,000 meter Olympic gold at Atlanta in 1996. In doing so, Gebrselassie had emulated his boyhood hero Miruts Yifter. The next four years saw Gebrselassie go unbeaten over 5,000 and 10,000 meters, smash records indoors and out -- taking his career world record tally to 15 -- and star in the 1999 Disney movie ""Endurance"" which chronicled his life. His triumph over his great rival, Kenyan Paul Tergat at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 is perhaps his most famous race. Gebrselassie -- who had spent the weeks prior to the games struggling with an Achilles tendon injury -- piped Tergat on the line by 0.09 seconds to retain his 10,000 meter Olympic title in dramatic fashion. The victory secured him national hero status at home in Ethiopia, and hundreds of thousands of fans cheered him through the streets of Addis Ababa in a homecoming parade. His attempts to win an unprecedented third Olympic title in Athens in 2004 were dashed by a recurrence of the Achilles tendon injury. Any sense of personal disappointment -- it is difficult to tell as Gebrselassie has always worn a smile in triumph or defeat -- was replaced with elation as his protégé and countryman Kenenisa Bekele took the gold medal. The previous year Gebrselassie had finished runner-up to Bekele in the World Championship 10,000 meters in Paris. Gebrselassie soon turned his attentions away from the track and began to focus on road running, in particular the half-marathon and the marathon. In 2006, he duly added the half-marathon world record to his collection and in September 2007 he broke the marathon world record in Berlin to register his 25th world record mark. Now 34 years old, his body shows no signs of fatigue -- physical or mental -- and he retains a hunger to achieve. Whatever happens in the future, his performances merit a permanent place in the pantheon of truly great sportsmen. Off the track, Gebrselassie has maintained his links with Ethiopia, choosing to live and work in Addis Ababa. He remains committed to promoting the Ethiopian cause, not always through charity -- although he lends his vigorous support to numerous projects -- but by repeating the mantra of reward through hard work. There can be few better role models for sport and life than he.","Inspired to start running after watching the 1980 Moscow Olympics .

"Augusta, Georgia (CNN) -- I'm a Masters rookie. My assignment here this week as part of CNN's coverage team marks the first time I've been to the tournament or Augusta National Golf Club. I don't know what I really expected when I got this assignment, but it sure wasn't what I found. Augusta is Orlando. That's what keeps going through my mind. Orlando for golf freaks. Florida in Georgia. Golf World, anyone? Arriving off Interstate 20 onto International Drive -- I mean Washington Road, which leads to Augusta National -- the first thing to catch my eye was the ticket brokers, some with just tents, others with tents set up outside their motorhomes. The only thing that seemed to be missing was the mandatory 90-minute timeshare presentation, but maybe that was being offered somewhere. Along the road, the restaurants and bars are jammed, and hawkers try to push traffic inside -- even the person dressed up as a Subway sandwich. Traffic is Orlando-like, too. It inches along and genteel Southern hospitality doesn't extend to the road. It can take forever for someone to let you make a turn across traffic. The entrance to Augusta could really be any Orlando theme park. In the mornings, the multiple lines are long as people get their passes checked and check in any bags. No backpacks in Augusta National. That means you have to get stuff inside. Disney perfected this, to great profit. Augusta National has it nailed too, but at least they don't nail you with the prices. Four dollars for a sandwich, chips and a Coke is nothing to complain about. Like Orlando's theme parks, they will get your last dollar at the souvenir stand -- they call it the golf shop at Augusta National -- and a Masters 2012 cap will set you back $24 and a polo shirt $65. But the lines are long and the patrons are leaving with large, clear plastic bags jammed with goods bearing the Masters logo. Before souvenirs though, should come the show, which is, of course, world class. These are the world's best golfers. But like the Shamu show at Sea World, the place is always jammed -- and when you think about it, the whale doesn't really do all that many tricks considering the time you waited. It was kind of like that watching the star of the Masters, Tiger Woods, on Thursday. I followed him on his back nine, about two and a half hours' worth of show. Woods hit 37 shots during that time. Of course, though I was there on each hole, I didn't see them all. The crowds were just massive, and I'm not tall enough to see over many folks. I did get within 20 yards of Woods twice, kind of in his splash zone, you could say. On the 18th hole, his tee shot did go directly over my head and get stuck under a bush. At Sea World, I would have needed the rainsuit. Another theme park show moment happened Wednesday when Woods, Mark O'Meara and Sean O'Hair came to play the 16th during their practice round. It's tradition on the hole that during practice rounds, after taking their tee shot on the par-3, players try to get balls onto the green by skipping them across the pond between the tee and the green. Most do it alone, I'm thinking magicians during Disney World's Main Street parade. But Woods, O'Meara and O'Hair lined up across the pond's edge and hit their skip balls in unison. It was like when the dolphins all do the same leap at the same time at Sea World. It did elicit the same kind of ""that's cool"" laugh from the crowd. But, in the end, golf's royalty saved this from being just like a trip to Orlando for me. During Wednesday's Par 3 tournament, I got to see Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer play two holes together. I had goosebumps (chicken skin, for some of you) and moist eyes. Player and Palmer each even made birdies. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, in Orlando that could compare to that.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In comments that were broadcast over the weekend, Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele called Rush Limbaugh's rhetoric ""incendiary"" and ""ugly"" and insisted that he is in charge of the GOP. ""Rush will say what Rush has to say; we'll do what we have to do,"" RNC Chairman Michael Steele has said. On Monday, however, after a blistering response from the conservative talk-radio kingpin, Steele told the online journal Politico that he ""was maybe a little bit inarticulate."" ""There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership,"" Steele said. He added, ""There are those out there who want to look at what he's saying as incendiary and divisive and ugly. That's what I was trying to say. It didn't come out that way."" Steele's original remarks came from an interview on CNN's ""D.L. Hughley Breaks the News."" The interview was recorded Thursday. It aired Saturday. The comments came as Democrats, including White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, have tried to paint Limbaugh -- who has said he wants to see the Obama administration ""fail"" -- as the effective head of the opposition party. Steele rejected the idea, insisting ""I'm the de facto leader of the Republican Party."" ""Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh's whole thing is entertainment,"" Steele told CNN. ""Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly."" iReport.com: Limbaugh and Steele show divisions in GOP . Limbaugh fired back on his radio show Monday, saying the Republican chairman appears to be supporting President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He said Steele appears ""obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds."" ""I frankly am stunned that the chairman of the Republican National Committee endorses such an agenda,"" Limbaugh said. ""I have to conclude that he does, because he attacks me for wanting it to fail."" But Monday night Steele told Politico he didn't intend to go after Limbaugh. ""My intent was not to go after Rush -- I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh,"" Steele told Politico in a telephone interview. ""I was maybe a little bit inarticulate ... There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership.""  Watch CNN's Roland Martin and panel discuss the situation » . Steele told Politico he tried to call Limbaugh after the show on Monday and said he hoped he would be able to talk to the radio host soon. ""I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking,"" Steele told Politico. ""I'm not going to engage these guys and sit back and provide them the popcorn for a fight between me and Rush Limbaugh."" And in a written statement issued to CNN, Steele said, ""To the extent that my remarks helped the Democrats in Washington to take the focus, even for one minute, off of their irresponsible expansion of government, I truly apologize."" ""I respect Rush Limbaugh, he is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice,"" Steele said. ""I'm sure that he and I will agree most of the time, but will probably disagree some as well, which is fine."" Steele's Democratic counterpart, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, said he was ""briefly encouraged"" by Steele's ""courageous"" remarks. ""However, Chairman Steele's reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party, its politics and its obstruction of President Obama's agenda in Washington,"" Kaine said in a written statement. Watch Steele, Hughley talk politics » . Limbaugh brought a cheering crowd to its feet several times as he called on fellow conservatives to take back the country. He used his self-described ""first national address,"" which ran more than an hour longer than his allotted 20 minutes, to accuse President Obama of inspiring fear in Americans in order to push a liberal agenda of ""big government."" Limbaugh also addressed comments he made earlier this year in which he said he hoped Obama failed. ""What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and re-form this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation?"" he said. But a top Republican in Congress disagreed. ""I don't think anyone wants anything to fail right now,"" House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""We have such challenges. What we need to do is we need to put forth solutions to the problems that real families are facing today."" RNC spokesman Alex Conant on Monday did not directly address Steele's comments about Limbaugh but pointed out the back-and-forth between the White House and the conservative radio host. ""Rahm Emanuel and the Democrats know they lose an argument with the Republican Party on substance, so they are building straw men to attack and distract,"" he said. ""The feud between radio host Rush and Rahm makes great political theater, but it is a sideshow to the important work going on in Washington. ""RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,"" Conant said.","NEW: Kaine says Steele's apology shows Limbaugh is leading GOP force .

"(CNN) -- Mitchell Johnson was in danger of becoming the forgotten man of Australian cricket. Shunned by the selectors after an alarming loss of form, he spent a year out of the Test team as he struggled to overcome a foot injury. But the 31-year-old is back with a bang, having terrorized Sri Lanka's batsmen to help the home side clinch a 2-0 series win in Melbourne on Friday. The left-arm paceman was named man of the match after claiming six wickets and scoring 92 not out as the tourists crumbled to defeat by an innings and 201 runs -- Sri Lanka's third worst reverse in the five-day game. Johnson, only playing because of injuries to other bowlers, followed up his four-wicket haul from Sri Lanka's first-innings 156 with a fiery spell that earned two more scalps and ended the tour of key batsman Kumar Sangakkara, who had scored 27. Sangakkara, who on the opening day joined the elite club of players to have scored 10,000 Test runs, needs surgery on a broken finger after being hit on the gloves by Johnson -- who also gave wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene a hairline thumb fracture in the first innings. Neither Jayawardene nor bowler Chanaka Welegedara were able to bat due to injuries, and Sri Lanka collapsed to 103-7 all out in 24.2 overs. Two wickets fell in Johnson's opening over of the innings, one of them a run out. ""The plan through this Test match was to get up their batters and unfortunately for them they got a few injuries out of it,"" said Johnson, who passed the milestone of 200 wickets in his 49th Test. ""I think that intimidation factor definitely worked out there today. We found a bit of a weakness with them with the short ball ... They obviously didn't handle it as well as they would have liked."" It marked a minor career resurrection for Johnson, who was Australia's main strike bowler until his form fell apart during the 2010-11 Ashes series against England. ""In the time I've had off I've been able to reflect on a lot of things. I had probably got to the stage where I listened to a lot of outside influences -- that doesn't affect me anymore. I'm just happy with how I've come back, and making the most of the opportunities I get,"" he said. ""It's not every day you get to play for your country, and I'm pretty proud of the fact I've played 49 Tests now. You've just got to look to the future and, if you get picked, go out there and make the most of it. That's what I'm doing ... and playing with a smile on my face. ""I've always been happy playing for Australia, it just got to the point where I was feeling the pressure. It happens in professional sports, you can feel the pressure and start to believe in things that are said or outside influences, and it just got to that point for me. ""I've moved past that. I'm 31, I've been around the game for a long time now and I think I've matured in that I have belief in myself and just go out there and play my game and do the best job I can."" Despite his heroics, Johnson is not guaranteed of starting the third Test in Sydney from January 3-7. Mitchell Starc is expected to return after being rested, while debutant Jackson Bird made a strong impression as an opening bowler, taking two wickets in each innings. ""His control with the new ball is an area that I think we've been looking for,"" captain Michael Clarke said. ""The one thing I really like about Jackson is you know what you're going to get. ""He bowled into the breeze the whole game and did a fantastic job for us. I think Birdy played a huge part in Mitch's success in the first innings, and it allows a bowler like Mitch to be able to attack."" Australia will be without key all-rounder Shane Watson, who has a calf injury, meaning Glenn Maxwell has the chance to make his Test debut after previous appearances in limited-overs internationals. Meanwhile, India leveled the Twenty20 series against Pakistan with an 11-run victory in the second match at Ahmedabad on Friday. The home side put on 192-5 after batting first, with Yuvraj Singh smashing 72 off 36 balls, sending seven deliveries over the boundary ropes. Pakistan could not follow up Tuesday's five-wicket win in Bangalore, finishing on 181-7 after 20 overs. Ashok Dinda took 3-36 from his four overs. It is the first bilateral series between the neighboring countries in five years. The three-match one-day series will start on Sunday.","Mitchell Johnson inspires Australia to innings victory over Sri Lanka in Melbourne .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- More Japanese factories and businesses in China shuttered Tuesday as an East China Sea island dispute threatens to drag relations between Asia's two largest economies to their lowest point since World War II. Meanwhile, Baidu -- China's most popular search engine -- waded into the dispute by showing a cartoon image of the Chinese flag over the disputed island on its homepage. Clicking on the image revealed a page headlined ""Diaoyu Island is China's!"" The page had an interactive feature asking web users to place a virtual flag on a map of the islands. By 2:30 p.m. China time, nearly 2.7 million people had planted virtual flags, according to the site. Baidu is a public Chinese company traded on Nasdaq, and also operates a Japanese language search engine. However, the image was not posted to its Japanese website.

Nissan, Mazda, Honda and Toyota suspended operations at some of their Chinese automotive plants, as have electronics makers Canon and Panasonic. Nearly 200 7-11 stores in Beijing and Chengdu, owned by Japanese company Seven & I Holdings, as well as 13 Ito Yokado supermarkets will be closed through Wednesday ""to maintain the safety of employees,"" company spokesperson Katsuhiko Shimizu said. Fears are high that demonstrations Tuesday -- the anniversary of Japan's 1931 invasion of China -- may repeat scenes of violence which saw a Panasonic factory lit on fire, Japanese restaurants and department stores ransacked and Japanese cars smashed and overturned. Meanwhile, a Japanese Coast Guard official told CNN Tuesday that a Chinese fisheries patrol boat has entered the disputed waters and a Japanese vessel will attempt to warn the ship away. Tensions in the dispute, a perennial source of nationalistic anger on both sides of the East China Sea, rose on September 10 after Japanese government agreed to buy the uninhabited islands from its private Japanese owners. China claims historical ownership of the island chain, while Tokyo maintains it has been in Japanese hands since 1895. The islands â€” known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyu in China -- were administered by the U.S. occupation force after World War II. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. The islands sit among popular fishing waters and are also believed to be rich in oil resources. Ownership of the chain would allow exclusive commercial rights in the seas surrounding the islands. China's fishing moratorium in the East China Sea ended on Sunday, raising concern that as more Chinese trawlers enter the area, so raises the likelihood of conflict. China's Ministry of Agriculture issued a statement saying the ""surrounding waters of Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islets are traditional fishing grounds for generations of Chinese fishermen,"" Beijing's CNTV reported Monday. Last Friday, China's state-run agency reported that six Chinese maritime surveillance ships entered the island chain and began patrols and ""law enforcement,"" China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Sales of Japanese car brands in China were down 2% compared to a year ago, China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said last week. Meanwhile, sales of foreign brands from Germany, the U.S., South Korea and France were up 25%, 19%, 12% and 4% respectively. Anti-Japanese protests in China on symbolic anniversary .

"(CNN) -- On the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, CNN asked users to share their stories of heroes from that fateful day and how they were being remembered. Sarah Glasgow of Easton, Pennsylvania, sent this photo of a 9/11 memorial made up of flags and shoes. Below is a selection of those responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Joshua Miller of Peoria, Illinois I would like to remember Patrick ""Joe"" Driscoll today. He lost his life aboard United Airlines Flight 93 on the morning of September 11, 2001. He was traveling with his friend, Billy Cashman, from New Jersey to California for a hiking trip. Joe was a man in his 70s who had had heart bypass surgery and hip replacement surgery. These physical setbacks didn't stop a feisty guy from New York City. He went on to live an active life. He was a fighter who had a gentle side. He adored his grandchildren, his children, and his wife. Joe is greatly missed. So many of us are so very proud of him. To ease my grief over the losses we all share from that terrible day, I often think of the passage from the gospel of John: ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."" Thank you, Joe. You did just that. Jennifer Brower of Alexandria, Virginia Ray Downey, the most decorated firefighter in the history of New York City, a tireless soldier in the battle for the safety and security of the people of the United States, and an amazing father and grandfather, died in the command post in New York City on September 11, 2001. I had the honor of getting to know Ray through our work on the Gilmore Commission. My daughter is named after him, and he is a constant source of inspiration whenever I am scared to do things. I do not know whether he was scared, but it certainly never stopped him. Anne-Marie Canter of San Francisco, California I had three heroes on that day. Two of them were firemen walking up the stairs of the North Tower as we were all walking down and out. We had been backed up on the stairwells and some people were starting to panic but when the two firemen came up and told us all to carry on walking, we would get out and they just walked up the stairs past us. They had such brave, courageous faces and their voices were so confident. They carried on up the stairs and we all felt much better and continued our way down. We all got out but I don't think they did and I will never forget those brave faces and the hope their strong voices gave us. My other hero is my friend Debbie -- she walked down next to me all the way and kept cheerful and even managed to make me smile when she made a joke about what a mess our mascara must be -- it sounds silly but at that point we all had no idea what was going on outside but we needed to distract ourselves from some of the smells and sounds in the stairwell and seeing someone so calm made me feel a lot calmer. We all are so much stronger than we think, and our actions have such an impact on those around us. Jennifer Taylor of Upland, California I believe that those of us who have continued on with our lives, continued to travel, work, pray, love and care for one another and stand by our way of life are heroes! I believe all of those who lost their lives that day would have wanted no less. We will never forget you, not one of you!!! Theju Mudda of Bangalore, India My deep condolences to the innocent people who got killed in the 9/11 event. The event should be remembered as Heroes Day --- for the people who sacrificed their lives trying to save other lives and for the people who gave their lives for no mistake of theirs. God bless their families! Emory Baird of Brodnax, Virginia A quick game of shuffleboard [was] interrupted by an intercom announcement declaring one of the Trade Center towers had been hit by a stray plane. Completely oblivious to what was happening, I continued my game. As a result of the events and disappointment in myself over my reaction, I am now a state certified firefighter. I can only pray for the courage you all showed. A special thanks to FDNY, we haven't forgotten you. From Company 2 to you, thank you. You set the example for the world. Gil Gonzales of Houston, Texas My heartfelt prayers go out to the families of all who died on 9/11. May God help them overcome their grief. Christina Joseph of Chicago, Illinois As a person who was there in NYC watching the monuments of my city fall down, I can only remember the compassion. The firefighters who came from all over the United States to help, to offer support and just to be there. The many doors of religious organizations that were open day and nights to offer solace. One such church was on Park Avenue near Grand Central and it had a sign that just said ""come in and sit"" and it did not matter who you were, where you came from, we all needed each other. We still do. Daniel S. Martin of Manchester, Connecticut My younger brother who is an American Airlines pilot flew on 9/11/01 from Boston's Logan to NYC's Kennedy and finally San Diego. He left Boston around 6 or 6:30 a.m., landed in NYC, took off no problem and headed to the West Coast around 8:30 or so. ... Unfortunately, we all know the rest of the story. ... He was ordered to land in Indiana, which he did, arriving safely (knees shaking!) with his crew, passengers and aircraft. ... He's my hero. Benedict Albensi of Winnipeg, Manitoba I am an American who lives and works in Winnipeg as a medical professor. I have been flying the American flag in my neighborhood all week as a tribute to those heroes and other victims who lost their lives on 9/11. Last July here in Winnipeg, someone put a Nazi swastika on my car's American flag sticker. So now I fly the U.S. flag a lot more than I used to. It is not trendy to be an American in many foreign countries right now. Living in a foreign country I find myself having to advocate why the USA is still the greatest country in the world. It is a tough sell these days. As Americans we have to let the world know that America has problems but we are not ""the"" problem. J.E. Seaman of Huntington, New York We never mention nearly often enough the flight attendants on all the planes, but especially AA Flight 11. Talk about guts, they identified the hijackers before the first plane hit. Talk about professionals! Talk about the courageous! Matt Williams of Katy, Texas I will be honoring the many victims and heroes of that day by wearing a 9/11 pin that was given to me by an Army buddy of mine. This will be the fourth year that I will wear it. I wear it only September 11. Natasha Jenkins of Ottawa, Kansas I was a senior in high school, sitting in a college prep class, early on the morning of September 11, 2001. I remember my English teacher hustling into the room to share the news about the first tower being hit just as our class was starting. Unknowing, I made a silly comment to the English teacher about something random and I'll never forget the look she gave me. Once we had the TV tuned in to CNN, I felt as though my innocence and naive nature had been forever changed. This year, I will remember the fallen with my own students, as this is my first year of teaching. I plan on discussing the event, the aftermath, and the memories with my sophomore world history students. Tim of Dothan, Alabama ""Heroes""? A media term we sometimes use for comfort. Perhaps it's easier to reconcile the deaths of 3,000 of our fellow Americans if we refer to them as heroes -- it implies that they died for a noble reason. Perhaps it's less traumatic to lose a loved one if we can justify calling them a ""hero."" But the sad fact is, many of those we lost, including my brother, simply got up that morning to face another (supposed) mundane day on the job. It's been six years, and the word ""hero"" still brings no comfort, no reconciliation. Justin Wright of Salt Lake City, Utah I remember it as clear as day. You don't ever forget images like what I saw on the television that morning or throughout the remainder of that particular day. The mere fact that United Airlines Flight 93 didn't make it to its target is a simple testimony to the spirit and dogged fight that there is in the people of this country. I think of those who gave their lives. ... May God bless all those on 9/11/01 who went before us. Laura Keefner of Great Barrington, Massachusetts My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of 9/11 and their families and our country. That horrific day lives in my mind and I will never forget. A flag hangs outside my house every day, and I hope the rest of America displays the flag this day and every day. This is your country, and people flock here every day because of all the USA has to offer. I am proud to be an American and I wish the country could go back to the days after 9/11 when we were so united and proud of our country. Now there is so much bickering between political parties and the American people. God bless all the victims of 9/11, all policemen, emergency workers, firefighters and our military. They are my true heroes. Michael White of London, England When the planes flew into the World Trade Center, I just could not believe it. Afterwards, I was contracted to expand the fiber optics at the morgue to accommodate the newly installed trailers for identification of the dead. I watched as our fallen firefighters and police officers' remains were brought in for identification. I don't think I will ever forget the heroes who gave their lives for others.

"(CNN) -- To contemplate Michael Jordan turning 50 on Sunday is to witness one's youth floating out with the tide, the water as merciless in its mission as Jordan was in his prime. He is in the sweet spot of the old ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch featuring Mike Myers, ""Middle Aged Man,"" about a guy who was older and wiser, and who obsessed about people looking at his gut. Jordan has been laid low these days because the team he owns, the Charlotte Bobcats, are one of the NBA's worst, and because he has been terrible at building a franchise. There is no doubt some schadenfreude at work here, with those who couldn't defeat Jordan as rival players or executives, or those who covered the league and watched the deferential treatment Jordan and the Bulls received. They now delight in burying him. What a bunch of morons. The end game: How sports stars battle through retirement . We all led comfortable lives because of Jordan: Me, all the sycophantic TV guys and writers in Chicago, everyone who worked at NBC in the '90s, everyone who played against him and who wrote about him. That doesn't mean you canonize the guy; it means you acknowledge that his excellence contributed directly to your well being, like the NASCAR driver who thanks the guys who designed the car. The NBA in the time of Jordan was at its zenith as a cultural force and a ratings behemoth, capable of drawing in what television people call ""casual viewers,"" who didn't know a pick and roll from a pimento roll, but who nonetheless turned on Jordan and the Chicago Bulls when they were winning championships. Athletes tend to get watered down with time, their rough edges rubbed out by biographers and historians who often fail to apply the rigorous discipline of their craft to sports, so much do they want to remain fans. Mickey Mantle's alcoholism was never front and center until it had almost killed him. God, I hope that never happens with Jordan. There are those who were appalled by his Hall of Fame speech, in which he sneered at those who had ever doubted him. I thought it was great. He finally showed everyone who he really was. There has been far too much hagiography written about Jordan, both in the past and now, far too much hero worship for a man who was, at his core, not an especially empathic person. That is not written pejoratively, for almost all the great athletes in any sport were singularly driven individuals who didn't play well with others. Do you hear stories of Tiger Woods yukking it up in clubhouses with his opponents? Bleacher Report: Jordan's unofficial guide to NBA success . Magic Johnson and Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas were each reviled by at least a few teammates for their brutal verbal takedowns of lesser players --and almost everyone in their respective locker rooms were lesser players. Jordan was merely the ultimate example of that ruthlessness, that desire to win that mutated into obsession. He finally won a title when he was surrounded by teammates who endured as much as they enjoyed, who could take his relentless prodding and testing and fight back, either verbally or on the court. Make no mistake -- many of them made millions of dollars and became Hall of Fame credible playing next to him. Jordan's Bulls came to town, won the game, took over the fans, took your pride, took your girl, took everything that wasn't nailed down. But it came with a price. But I liked that about Jordan. He was the best player I ever saw, the most determined, the toughest mentally, the most confident, the least insecure. His will was second to none. He took everyone on, and ultimately beat them. That is the Jordan that is worth remembering, no matter what he winds up doing in Charlotte: Young and handsome and dynamic and so willing to cut out your heart and show it to you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Aldridge.","Basketball great Michael Jordan turns 50 on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Margaret Thatcher is best known for her domestic economic policy changes, from lifting exchange controls and slashing marginal tax rates, to privatizing state-run industries and bringing the labor unions back under the rule of law. She also ushered in an era of contracting out which saw local city services soar in quality while costs plunged, and she gave tenants of public housing units a legal right to buy at deeply discounted prices. She changed the landscape. Millions bought their own homes and many more millions started buying shares for the first time. Self-employment became a real vogue and a venture capital industry emerged and grew like Topsy. Over 11 and a half years in power she became an international icon, regularly facing down terrorists and military dictators, from the Iran Embassy siege through the Falkland Islands war, to the bomb happy IRA who nearly got her scalp one fall in the infamous Brighton bomb. European Union bureaucrats in Brussels trembled at her approach and the regular tongue lashings. The noun handbag became a verb as in ""to be handbagged,"" namely hit over the head with a fashion accessory that was rumored to contain a brick. The inside joke was: Rome wasn't built in a day but then Margaret wasn't foreman on that job. Used Thatcher handbags went for thousands at fundraising auctions. It was all a bit of an exaggeration, as she did worry a great deal about some of her more radical policies. Her policy of privatizing the commanding heights of the economy which had been nationalized by the socialists (1945-1951) turned rotten tax-guzzling behomeths into nimble world-class tax-paying companies. This started a worldwide trend which continues to this day. She worked closely throughout his two terms with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. They had met twice in the mid 1970s, both times a one hour appointment which ended up going beyond three hours. It was husband Denis Thatcher who first spotted Reagan's talents when he spoke at a London business dinner, and sped to their Flood St, Chelsea, home to tell his wife that this man was really right up her street. She started with Jimmy Carter in the White House (he complained that he could not get a word in edgeways with her) and ended with the first Bush, notably with her famous advice on Kuwait: ""Don't go wobbly on me, George."" But it was Reagan with whom she really solidified the transatlantic bridge. They fell out only once when she roasted him for not alerting her to the invasion of Grenada. He put her on speakerphone in the Oval Office and let her blast away, before telling her that he had been warned not to alert her because her Foreign Office leaked so badly. He could not risk American lives just for the sake of briefing a friend, however close. It was of course the steadfastness of the president, the pope, and the prime minister which brought down that wall and destroyed the evil empire without a shot being fired. She was the first leader to visit Reagan after he won power and the last to visit him as his second term ended. When she did not share his passion for horse riding Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II took care of matters. Margaret, or Lady T as we all called her after her elevation to the Upper House, loved America. She had toured coast to coast, north to south. She went twice in the late 1960s, firstly as a guest of the State Department -- which openly touted her as a future prime minister -- and secondly as a lecturer for the U.S. branch of the English Speaking Union. It was said by her Downing Street staff that the second she set foot in America there was a new spring in her step and she lost ten years. Thatcher loved it when the communists in Moscow early on labeled her the Iron Lady. They thought it was an insult, but she turned it into a compliment and went on to melt the Iron Curtain. She and Reagan never believed a word of Soviet propaganda. As early as 1950, when she first stood for parliament in her early 20s, she said that as long as we stick to principle we have nothing to fear from Russian communism. What an astonishing prediction from an astonishing woman. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Blundell .","European Union bureaucrats in Brussels trembled at her approach and the regular tongue lashings, writes Blundell .

"(CNN) -- CNN has triumphed at the 2012 Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) Awards, winning two accolades in the breaking news and multiplatform categories in San Antonio, Texas Wednesday. The IRE Awards, which recognize the most outstanding watchdog journalism of the year, announced CNN's coverage of the U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi as the winner of the ""Investigations Triggered By Breaking News"" category. Jeff Zucker, President of CNN Worldwide, described the award-winning pieces as ""powerful and provocative acts of journalism."" Read the IRE winners announcement . The judging panel highlighted CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon's ""courageous reporting"" in Benghazi, saying it ""provided valuable context about the milieu in which the consulate attack occurred."" Judges commented that: ""CNN correspondent Arwa Damon and photojournalist Sarmad Qaseera arrived quickly in Benghazi to find valuable clues in the wide-open but looted and burned ruins of the consulate. Damon's stories refuted reports that the attack on the consulate was part of larger anti-American demonstrations throughout the Middle East."" WATCH: What Damon saw in U.S. Consulate . The judges said Damon provided insight into the mind of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the September attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi. Her coverage examined conditions in Libya leading up to the attack and revealed Stevens' concerns over what he called the security threats in the city and a rise in Islamic extremism. Judges also praised the CNN Digital investigation ""Slavery's Last Stronghold,"" which explored oppression in Mauritania. Awarding the investigation the ""Multiplatform -- Large"" award, they said it upheld ""the highest ideals of journalism."" CNN digital reporters John D. Sutter and Edythe McNamee exposed the lack of prosecution for slavery and continued oppression of citizens in Mauritania, which was the last in the world to outlaw the practice. These accolades mark the first time CNN has been crowned in multiple categories at the IRE Awards in the same year. In February, CNN won ""News Channel of the Year"" at the Royal Television Society Awards in London, while last November, the international news network was also honored with three awards for its outstanding storytelling efforts at the Foreign Press Association Media awards.","CNN has been awarded two Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) awards .

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League will become the first domestic championship in the world to use goal-line technology (GLT), it was confirmed on Thursday. At a meeting of the Premier League's 20 chairmen in London, the historic decision to use goal-line technology for the start of the 2013-2014 season was approved. It means the system provided by British-based firm Hawk-Eye, chosen ahead of German company GoalControl, will be in place for the curtain-raising Community Shield on 10-11 August. ""Football is fundamentally a simple game; whichever side scores most goals wins,"" said Chief Executive Richard Scudamore on the Premier League's official website. ""So, when one is scored, or indeed not scored, and we have the ability through technology to definitively know whether the ball crossed the line we should absolutely use it. ""Fans, players and managers exhort, strain and stress respectively for their teams to score or prevent goals being scored, so we as administrators should do all that we can to ensure the correct decisions are being made."" Scuadmore said that the fact that Hawk-Eye used cameras was a 'critical' factor in selecting the technology, since it can be replayed by broadcasters -- with the Premier League also exploring whether replays can be played on big screens inside stadiums. ""It is essential that fans see the system in action to know that it is working,"" he added. Hawk-Eye's system uses seven cameras to track the movement of the ball and sends a signal -- within a second -- to watches worn by match officials when a goal is scored. FIFA had long opposed the use of the technology until a valid England goal was disallowed at the 2010 World Cup, prompting president Sepp Blatter to alter his stance on the issue. Fabio Capello was at the helm on that occasion but current England manager Roy Hodgson believes the introduction of GLT represents a watershed moment in the history of football. ""It's probably one of those moments that will go down with the changes to the offside rule and the back-pass rule, which most of us at the time were very skeptical about, but which we've now taken to our hearts because we appreciate it,"" he said. First trialled by FIFA at last year's Club World Cup in Japan, GLT will be used at July's Confederations Cup and next year's World Cup in Brazil, with Germany company GoalControl set to provide the technology on both occasions. Overlooked by FIFA for those tournaments, Hawk-Eye -- which already provides ball-tracking systems for tennis and cricket -- will install its technology in 20 Premier League grounds and at Wembley, which will host August's Community Shield. England is the first of Europe's major leagues to announce plans to introduce GLT with Germany's Bundesliga saying last month it had no plans to use the technology until 2015 at the earliest. While the head of Italy's Serie A said this week that he saw no need to use GLT, a leading Spanish official said he hopes to adopt the system within three years. ""We are not going to be as quick as the Premier League but we are in favor of the system,"" said Francisco Roca Perez. ""I expect that in two or three years we will be able to do something like this, either with technology that we buy or that we create ourselves."" In a separate development, the Premier League has ratified controls that oblige clubs to restrict losses to a limit of $162 million over a three-year period. The move has been made to put a break on clubs' spending, with many suffering economic concerns in recent times. According to the most recently-published accounts, defending champions Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Aston Villa have all reported losses in excess of $162m over the last three years. The Premier League says clubs that break the rules could face a points deduction.","Premier League sanctions use of goal-line technology for 2013-2014 season .
