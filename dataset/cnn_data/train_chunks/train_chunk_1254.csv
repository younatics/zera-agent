Ms Barrymore's final post on her Facebook page was a quote she shared from Mystera Magazine . Freckles: A photograph of Jessica as a child, which she posted on her Facebook page . In a cryptic last message on her profile page on July 28, Ms Barrymore shared a post from Mystera Magazine that said: 'Life doesn't always introduce you to the people you want to meet. 'Sometimes,life puts you in touch with the people you need to meet to Help You, to Hurt You, to Guide You, to Leave You, to Love You, and to gradually Strengthen You into the Person You Were Meant to Become.' Jessica’s posts on Facebook also give an insight into her life as a spiritual person. Five days ago she posted a prayer from a book with the title: ‘I forgive and I am forgiven.’. It read: 'The moment I forgive I am receptive to divine forgiveness. This is the promise of the wisest sages and a spiritual truth I live every day'. There are quotes from Nelson Mandela, Mother Theresa and Aristotle which show she took a philosophical approach to life. One of Hollywood's most famous child stars, Drew Barrymore had a well-documented battle with drugs and alcohol in her teenage years and has often spoken about her strained family life. In her autobiography Little Girl Lost, published when she was 14, Drew wrote, ‘I had my first drink at age nine, began smoking marijuana at ten and at 12 took up cocaine.’ By 13 she was in rehab and following a suicide attempt and a further stint in rehab, at 15 she successfully petitioned for emancipation from her parents. Her father John was an alcoholic and abandoned Drew and her mother when she was a baby and was in and out of jail on drugs charges before he died of cancer. And her mother Jaid, who struggled as an actress, took her to nightclubs when she was just eight, and to auditions before she was a year old. Drew has described the relationship as 'my greatest battle'. And the Barrymore's relationship with substance abuse doesn't end there. Drew's grandfather, the legendary actor John Barrymore, died from alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver aged 60.

"Stephen King might never have made it as a best-selling author and Carrie would never have existed if it hadn’t been for his wife, Tabby. The new Hollywood movie, Carrie, which is the third silver-screened adaption of King’s horror story, was released on Friday, October 18, starring Julianne Moore and Chloë Grace Moretz. But 40 years ago, when King wrote the first three pages of Carrie in 1973, he immediately crumpled them up and threw them in the dustbin. Scroll down for video... Believed in him: Stephen King, right, says his wife Tabby, left, saved Carrie from the dustbin. Carrie launched his career as a best-selling author . Discarded: The horror story, Carrie, by Stephen King, almost did not make it past three pages . He was disappointed in himself and felt he couldn’t write from a woman’s perspective, according to Mental Floss. The whole story disgusted him, too. Carrie White, the main character, was an annoying, ready-made victim and he felt the plot was already moving too slowly. ‘I couldn’t see wasting two weeks, maybe even a month, creating a novella I didn’t like and wouldn’t be able to sell,’ King wrote in his memoir, On Writing. ‘So I threw it away … After all, who wanted to read a book about a poor girl with menstrual problems?’ The next day, his wife Tabby found the . three crinkled balls of paper and when King came home from work, she . told him, ‘You’ve got something here. I really think you do'. First attempt: In the early 70s King felt Carrie White, the main character, was an annoying, ready-made victim when he first wrote the book . Over the next few weeks, Tabby guided . her husband through the world of women, giving tips on how to mold the . characters and the famous shower scene. Nine months later the final draft was finished. This . was at a time when King was a poor man. He and Tabby lived in a trailer . and drove a rusty Buick held together by baling wire and duct tape. Tabby . worked second-shift at Dunkin’ Donuts while King taught English at . Hampden Academy, a private high school in eastern Maine. To scrape by, King worked summers at an industrial laundry and moonlighted as a janitor and gas pump attendant. Barely scraping by: King worked summers at an industrial laundry and moonlighted as a janitor and gas pump attendant while he was writing Carrie in the early 70s . He modelled the character of Carrie on two of the loneliest girls he remembered from high school. One was a timid epileptic with a voice that always gurgled with phlegm. Her fundamentalist mother kept a life-size crucifix in the living room, and it was clear to King that the thought of it followed her down the halls. The second girl was a loner who wore the same outfit every day, which drew cruel taunts. By the time King wrote Carrie, both of those girls were dead. The first died alone after a seizure. The second suffered from postpartum depression and, one day, aimed a rifle at her stomach and pulled the trigger. The final draft was turned down for 30 publishers, but one, the editor at Doubleday Publishing, Bill Thompson, offered him a $2,500 advance to publish the book. Instant: Stephen King was catapulted to fame with the book Carrie in 1973 and has written many books since . King used the advance to buy a shiny Ford Pinto and moved his family out of the trailer and into a dumpy four-room apartment in Bangor, Maine. They suddenly had money for groceries and could even afford a telephone. He hoped that fat royalty checks would keep replenishing his bank account, but Carrie only sold 13,000 copies as a hardback, which convinced him to grudgingly sign a new teaching contract for the 1974 school year. But soon after, one phone call changed everything. It was Bill Thompson again. ‘Are you sitting down?’ he asked. King was home alone, standing in the doorway between his kitchen and living room. ‘Do I need to? he said. ‘You might,’ Thompson said. ‘The paperback rights to Carrie went to Signet Books for $400,000 ... 200K of it is yours. Congratulations, Stephen.’ Break-through: The paperback rights to Carrie were given to Signet Books for $400,000 in 1973 at a time when King was a poor teacher with almost no money . Successful: King is now the 19th best-selling author of all time . Carrie sold over 1 million copies in its first year as a paperback despite a mixed critical response. The New York Times was impressed, considering it was a first novel, while Library Journal called it ‘terribly overdone.’ Falling somewhere in the middle, the critic at the Wilson Library Journal said, ‘It’s pure trash, but I loved it.’ The book-buying public was more enthusiastic - Carrie was a hit. The novel struck a sympathetic chord with teens and adults who knew what it was like to be an outsider. In 1975, it was adapted into a profitable feature film, which sparked a sequel a decade later. The second version: Actress Emily Bergl in the 1998 film adaption of Carrie . New version: The new film adaption of Carrie, starring Chloë Grace Moretz, pictured, was released on October 18 . The story about Carrie struck a sympathetic chord with teens and adults who knew what it was like to be an outsider . King modelled the character of Carrie on two of the loneliest girls he remembered from high school. The new movie came out on Friday . Now the 19th best-selling author of all time, King won the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2003 and was invited to speak at the National Book Awards. When he spoke, he didn’t talk about writing or success or money. He talked about the woman who rescued Carrie from the trash and insisted he keep going - Tabby. ‘If my wife had suggested to me even with love and kindness and gentleness ... that the time had come to put my dreams away and support my family, I would have done that with no complaint,’ said King at the awards ceremony. But the thought never crossed her mind. And if you open any edition of Carrie, you’ll read the same dedication: ‘This is for Tabby, who got me into it—and then bailed me out of it.’","Stephen King wrote Carrie in 1973 but threw away the first three pages because he didn't like it .

"Lassana Diarra has been forced to formally deny claims that he had become an Islamic warrior fighting in Syria. The 29-year-old, who patrolled midfield for Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth, said he had never set foot in the war-torn country. Eric Dupond-Moretti, a lawyer for the France international, said Paris-born Diarra 'denies in the most formal, the most categoric, the most absolute fashion that he has gone to Syria'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the claims that Lassana Diarra is fighting in Syria . Strenuous: Former Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth midfielder . Lassana Diara (right) has been forced to deny rumours circulating on . Twitter that he is a jihadist fighting in Syria . Rumour: In a video posted on an extremist website on . Saturday, a man claimed to be of a former Arsenal footballer now fighting . in Syria, sparking Twitter talk that it was the defensive midfielder . Diarra is now playing for Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia. Dupond-Moretti said: 'He has never set foot in Syria. It's absurd. He is not a jihadist, he is a footballer with Lokomotiv Moscow.' There were social media rumours that Diarra had gone to Syria, where a civil war is now into a fourth year and has cost more than 150,000 lives. Mr Dupond-Moretti said Diarra was expected to turn out for his Russian team in a league game on Sunday. After winning the FA Cup with Pompey in 2008, Diarra joined Real Madrid and was a member of the squad that won the Spanish championship in 2010. Hundreds of young Muslim Frenchmen are currently fighting jihad in Syria, mainly for Al Qaeda forces. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has warned that all those who return home will create a huge security risk. Earlier this year two teenage French boys ran away from school to travel to Syria to join the war there, before being arrested in Turkey. The footage, which appeared at the weekend and is apparently shot in Syria, shows the man calling on Muslims in the West to travel to the war-torn region and fight with radical militants. The man, whose face is hidden by a balaclava and is seen clutching a AK47 rifle, is identified as Abu Isa al-Andalus. Strong denial: A lawyer for the French international says he has never even set foot in Syria . Claim: The man's face is covered during the video, in which he clutches an AK47 assault rifle . According to FiSyria.com, the site that posted the video, the man moved to London from his native country to play for Arsenal after growing up alongside a world-famous footballer. It claims the man was radicalised in the capital two years ago before 'leaving everything' to join the al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He later adds: 'We have conquered . many cities and we are now implementing the Sharia. We have areas where . the kaffirs (non-Muslims) are paying us the tax. 'If we stay in the kaffir countries we have to pay (taxes) to them. Do you want to be humiliated by this? Think about it. 'If you have family in these (Western) countries it's a must for you to put your children in the kaffir schools. ""Who is going to teach your children?"" It's going to maybe be a gay, maybe a drug dealer, maybe a paedophile. 'It's very important for you to protect your children. Allah says they are the worst of creatures.' The Russian-based website does not confirm the man's previous identity on the page, which shows two videos each roughly four-minutes long. Wrong man: A spokesman for Arsenal say they have no record . of a past player called Abu Isa al-Andalus, although it is thought the . man may have changed his identity . Text next to the video reads: 'He... played for Arsenal in London, and [then] left football, money and the European way of life to make the path of Allah.' Senior security officials have said that at least 250 British-based 'extremist tourists' have gone to Syria to train and fight. Director General of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) Charles Farr said earlier this year that the war in the country now presents 'the biggest challenge' since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Mr Farr said: 'Syria is different from any other counter-terrorism challenge that we have faced since 9/11, because of the number of terrorist groups now engaged in the fighting, their size and scale, the number of people from this country who are joining them, ease of travel, availability of weapons and the intensity of the conflict.'","Extremist appeared in video claiming to be the former Arsenal player .

"The boss of the NSA has denied claims the agency routinely eavesdrops on the phone calls of Americans, insisting that fewer than 60 'U.S. persons' were currently being targeted worldwide. General Keith Alexander said the agency only targets the communications of nationals 'with a probable cause' after obtaining a court order. He was speaking to CBS television's 60 Minutes after granting the station unprecedented access to its secretive HQ in a belated damage-limitation exercise in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks. On the defence: NSA chief General Keith Alexander tells CBS's 60 Minutes that the agency is only spying on fewer than '60 U.S. persons' as he denies claims it routinely listened into phone calls . Preserving their reputation: 60 Minutes was granted unprecedented access to its secretive HQ in a belated damage-limitation exercise in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks . 'NSA can only target the communications of a US person with a probable cause finding under specific court order,' he said, referring to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 'Today, we have less than 60 authorisations on specific persons to do that.' Alexander challenged the view that the NSA was engaged in listening to the content of phone calls, but acknowledged that basic information of more than 300million phone records were collected. He said: 'There's no reason that we would listen to the phone calls of Americans. There’s no intelligence value in that. 'There's no reason that we'd want to read their email. There is no intelligence value in that.' Alexander's second-in command, Rick Ledgett, later told the program that Snowden had effectively stolen the 'keys to the kingdom' when he swiped more than 1.5 million top secret files. Damaging: Another NSA chief, Rick Ledgett (pictured), told the program that Snowden had effectively stolen the 'keys to the kingdom' when he swiped more than 1.5 million top secret files . Worried: Ledgett said of particular concern was Snowden's theft of around 31,000 documents the NSA official described as an 'exhaustive list of the requirements that have been levied against the NSA' Ledgett, who heads the NSA taskforce in . charge of assessing the impact of Snowden's leaks, said the contractor . possessed a 'roadmap' of the US intelligence community's strengths and . weaknesses. He said of particular concern was Snowden's theft of around 31,000 documents the NSA official described as an 'exhaustive list of the requirements that have been levied against the National Security Agency.' 'What that gives is, what topics we're interested in, where our gaps are,' said Ledgett. 'Additional information about US capabilities and US gaps is provided as part of that.' The information could potentially offer a rival nation a 'roadmap of what we know, what we don't know, and give them - implicitly - a way to protect their information from the US intelligence community's view,' the NSA official added. 'It is the keys to the kingdom.' Secretive operations: The NSA has made dozens of changes in its operations and computer networks to prevent the emergence of another Snowden . Ledgett said he would be open to the possibility of an amnesty for Snowden, who remains exiled in Russia, if he agreed to stop further leaks of classified information. 'My personal view is, yes, it's worth having a conversation about' a possible deal, said Ledgett. Snowden has been charged with espionage by US authorities for divulging reams of secret files. The former NSA contractor has insisted he spilled secrets to spark public debate and expose the NSA's far-reaching surveillance. But Alexander rejected the idea of any amnesty for Snowden. 'This is analogous to a hostage-taker taking 50 people hostage, shooting 10 and then say 'You give me full amnesty and I'll let the other 40 go,' Alexander told 60 Minutes. In all, Ledgett says Snowden is likely to still be in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents as he waits in asylum in Russia. Top secret: A room known as the black chamber where the NSA's codebreakers operate . Meanwhile, the NSA has made dozens of changes in its operations and computer networks to prevent the emergence of another Snowden, including potential disciplinary action, a top NSA official said on Friday, as a White House review panel recommended restraints on NSA spying. In the more than hour-long interview with Reuters, Ledgett acknowledged the agency had done a poor job in its initial public response to revelations of vast NSA monitoring of phone and Internet data; pledged more transparency; and said he was deeply worried about highly classified documents not yet public that are among the 1.7 million Snowden is believed to have accessed. He also stoutly defended the NSA's mission of tracking terrorist plots and other threats, and said its recruiting of young codebreakers, linguists and computer geeks has not been affected by the Snowden affair - even as internal morale has been. 'Any time you trust people, there is always a chance that someone will betray you,' he said. The NSA is taking 41 specific technical . measures to control data by tagging and tracking it, to supervise agency . networks with controls on activity, and to increase oversight of . individuals. The NSA's HQ in Fort Meade, Maryland: Ledgett said Snowden's documents could potentially give rival nations a 'roadmap' showing them how to  protect their information from the US intelligence community's view . Measures include requiring two-person . control of every place where someone could access data and enhancing the . security process that people go through and requiring more frequent . screenings of systems administrative access, Ledgett said. After . months of sometimes blistering criticism in the news media and by . Congress and foreign governments, the publicity-averse NSA is now . mounting an effort to tell its side of the Snowden story. Ledgett, . a 36-year intelligence veteran who reportedly is in line to be the . agency's deputy director, joked that doing media interviews was 'a . complete out-of-body experience for me.' He . spoke to Reuters on the same day that the White House said it had . decided to maintain the practice of having a single individual head both . the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, which conducts cyberwarfare - an . outcome the NSA leadership favored. Separately, . news reports late Thursday said an outside review panel appointed by . the White House has recommended changes in a program disclosed by . Snowden that collects basic data on Americans' phone calls - known as . metadata. Bargaining Chip: Authorities say Snowden still has 1.5 million classified documents in his possession . The panel reportedly said the data should be held by an organization other than the NSA and stricter rules should be enforced for searching the databanks. Ledgett declined to discuss the . panel's specific recommendations. But he seemed to acknowledge that . tighter guidelines for NSA eavesdropping were in the offing, saying that . what is technologically possible 'has gotten ahead of policy.' Snowden, . who is living under asylum in Russia, disclosed a vast U.S. eavesdropping apparatus that includes the phone metadata program; NSA . querying of Internet communications via major companies such as Google . Inc and Facebook Inc; and widespread tapping of international . communication networks. Ledgett made no apologies for what many see as overly aggressive NSA monitoring. He . noted that the U.S. government's intelligence taskings to the agency . run to 36,000 pages, and said its activities take place within a 'box' of U.S. laws and policies.'We'll color in every square . millimeter of that box,' he said, implying the NSA will use its legal . authorities to the fullest extent possible. The . NSA's internal review has determined about 98 percent of the scope of . the material that Snowden had accessed, and officials have found no . evidence that he had help either within the NSA or from adversary spy . agencies. Ledgett said . that when Snowden was downloading the documents, NSA was ahead of other . intelligence agencies in installing 'insider threat' software that . President Barack Obama ordered in the wake of an earlier leak scandal . involving the group WikiLeaks. But installation of the software, which might have stopped Snowden, was not complete. 'Snowden hit at a really opportune time. For him - not for us,' he said. Ledgett said that most of the Snowden material released publicly so far has been about NSA programs and partnerships with foreign countries and companies, rather than intelligence reports and 'requirements.' The latter refers to U.S. government taskings to the NSA to answer questions about specific targets. That last category is what keeps him up at night. 'Those make me nervous because they reveal what we know and what we don't know and they are almost a roadmap for adversaries.' No one at the NSA has yet lost their job over the Snowden crisis, including at the Hawaii site where he worked. Ledgett said three people are under review for potential disciplinary action, but declined further comment.","Gen Keith Alexander says NSA does not routinely eavesdrop on US citizens .

Cllr Dean can be heard on the voicemail asking Cllr Morrison 'what the hell he was playing at' after apparently telling a local paper he may step down after just one term in office. He then continues his tirade, repeatedly swearing, before shouting: 'You have really p***** on your chips this time mate'. Cllr Morrison, who became the city’s youngest elected councillor when he won an election aged 18 in 2011, was suspended shortly afterwards by the Labour party following complaints about his behaviour by fellow council member Wavertree MP Luciana Berger. He claimed he was the victim of a 'witch-hunt' and wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband slamming Miss Berger as a 'privately-educated MP from London who has come to Liverpool to make my life a misery'. He also complained to the city mayor . that he wasn't happy that Cllr Dean was looking into Miss Berger's . complaints because of the voicemail. Cllr Morrison resigned from his post last month and has now uploaded the clip to Youtube and Facebook with the message: 'Just been clearing up my little desktop and found this voicemail I recorded. 'One for those know-it-alls who like to paint their own little picture about why I left the Labour Party.' Embarrassing: Cllr Jake Morrison resigned from Liverpool City Council, pictured, and released the footage online to show what life in local politics is like . Cllr Morrison said he chose to release the tape now, more than three months after the phonecall, because: 'As time goes on, I’m getting criticised – people don’t know half the picture that went on and this is something I decided to do to quite clearly outline the way I was treated and something needs to be done about it. 'I just wanted to show people the way I was treated... it’s aggressive, it’s nasty, it was bullying as far as I’m concerned. 'The chief whip’s role is not just about punishing people, it’s about supporting people. Cllr Dean has been around in politics for 20 years, that’s how he speaks to someone who has been in it for two. 'He seems to think he’s the Malcolm Tucker of local politics.' Cllr Alan Dean admitted he left the voicemail. He added: 'It’s quite obvious that I left the voicemail message, I don’t deny that, I don’t retract anything I say in it. 'I was very angry at the time for what he had done and the way he behaved after all the support he got.' Cllr Dean also denied that the tape reflected his typical style as party whip and claimed Cllr Morrison had 'stabbed us in the back'. He added: 'I think people can draw their own conclusions from the fact of the date it was sent and the date it was published and that’s taken so long if he was so offended about it why has he published it so long [after]. I believe he’s got an ulterior motive in doing so.'","Liverpool City Council's Labour chief whip Alan Dean left a foul-mouthed rant on cllr Jake Morrison's answerphone after hearing he wished to resign .

"Autumn Pollard, a student in Arkansas, was not expecting a grand proposal from a star football player in front of her entire school this week. But during her high school's pep rally, where she usually takes center stage to dance with the mascot, the junior was asked to her first ever prom in an unforgettable moment that left her in tears. The 19-year-old, who was born with a genetic disorder called Noonan syndrome which causes abnormal growth to parts of the body,  said the proposal was a dream come true and that she looks forward to the memories. Scroll down for video . Autumn Pollard, a student in Arkansas, was not expecting a grand proposal from star football player, Cope Robinson, in front of her entire school this week . During her high school's pep rally, where she usually takes center stage to dance with the mascot, the junior was asked to her first ever prom in an unforgettable moment that left her in tears . Her disorder was confirmed by Harvard in 2004 and she is only 4ft tall and weighs 57lb, according to ABC News. In the heart-warming moment captured on video, Autumn was dancing in front of her classmates in the gymnasium filled with Corning High School students. The mascot turned her around and she was surprised by a group of fellow students holding signs that spelled out the word 'prom' - with an arrow pointing to Cope Robinson, who had purple flowers in his hand, according to KAIT. Autumn, who was born with a genetic disorder called Noonan syndrome which causes abnormal growth to parts of the body, was unaware that she was being set up for a proposal to prom . The mascot turned her around where she was met with a group of fellow students holding signs that spelled out the word 'prom' - with an arrow pointing to Cope . With purple flowers in hand, the sophomore knelt down and asked Autumn to prom . Surprised by the proposal, Autumn said yes as her eyes filled with tears and she hugged Cope. She said she is excited for the memories . As the sophomore knelt down on one knee with everyone in the room shouting Autumn's name, he asked her to prom, and the surprised, teary-eyed teen said yes. Cope, 16, said he knew she wanted to go to the prom with him as they attend the same church. He said: 'Me, my sister Kandra Leonard and friend Marry-Ann Grubb set it up to go down at our last pep rally. 'The best part was seeing how happy she was. I'm looking forward to giving her the best prom possible.' In an emotional moment, Autumn is embraced by friends and family after the exciting ordeal . Her mother said she was not expecting the proposal to prom to happen and that she cried once it did . As she looks forward to April 18, the date of the prom, she said she is looking forward to spending time with her date . Autumn's mother, Suzanne Pollard, who was present during the touching moment said she was not aware of what was taking place, and that once it happened they cried. As the teen is excited for a fun night with Cope on April 18, Autumn said she is looking forward to shopping for a prom dress and spending time with her date. Cope hopes that people will see the video of him asking her to prom and that it will inspire people to be kind to others. Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that is usually diagnosed at birth. Some cases can go undiagnosed until a child gets older. The three most common of the syndrome are unusual facial features, short stature and heart defects present at birth. It is mostly uncommon and there is an estimated 1 in 2,500 children who are born with it - the disorder affects both sexes and all ethnic groups. The severity of the features of the disorder range from mild to life-threatening. Noonan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation that occurs when the normal instructions that are carried in certain genes are scrambled - meaning some of the body’s processes do not work as normal. There currently is no cure for the treatment. Source: National Health Service .","Autumn Pollard, 19, from Arkansas has Noonan syndrome - which causes abnormal growths to parts of the body .

"The BBC has accused supporters of Scottish independence of launching a lobbying campaign against presenter Andrew Marr about a live TV clash with Alex Salmond. Messages posted online accused Mr Marr of being a ‘paid Tory employee’, an ‘establishment puppet’ and a ‘racist wee s****’. Pro-independence supporters also took to Twitter to encourage people to complain to the BBC, after Mr Marr told the First Minister it would be ‘quite hard’ for Scotland to rejoin the European Union. Clash: Sparks flew after BBC host Andrew Marr told First Minister Alex Salmond it would be 'quite hard' for an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU . On Sunday, senior Nationalists demanded ‘answers’ from the broadcaster and suggested editorial guidelines may have been breached, while one MP claimed Marr could face ‘consequences’. During his Sunday morning show on BBC One, Mr Marr said of an independent Scotland’s membership of the EU: ‘I think it would be quite hard to get back in, I have to say.’ Mr Salmond immediately hit back during the interview, and demanded to know: ‘Is that an individual expression or is that an expression of the BBC?’ Glasgow-born Mr Marr insisted he was commenting having recently interviewed Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president. Mr Barroso said it would be ‘extremely difficult, if not impossible’ for an independent Scotland to join the EU, highlighting the Spanish government’s refusal to recognise Kosovo’s declaration of independence. Now the BBC has revealed it has found evidence of an organised lobbying campaign against Mr Marr. The broadcaster declined to publish . the number of complaints it has received about the interview after being . approached by the Mail. A . spokeswoman said: ‘In this case, there is evidence of lobbying on the . issue and we have a policy that we do not issue complaints figures when . there is evidence of lobbying.' A discussion on the Scottish National Party’s Facebook page about the interview saw several personal attacks on Mr Marr. One user wrote: ‘Andrew Marr must be a paid Tory employee?’ Another said: ‘I used to like Andrew Marr but its clear he's become just another establishment puppet.’ Better Together campaigners who oppose Scottish independence today held an event to mark six months until the independence referendum . Voters go to the polls on September 18 to decide the fate of the 300-year-old union . Opponents of independence have faced increased attacks from nationalists online . Another message said: ‘Andrew Marr's interview with Salmond was a biased disgrace. Shame on him and his biased BBC. Will be interesting to see the grovelling they embark upon when we are Independant #YES’ A message posted later stated: ‘That was a shocking interview today! Marr should hang his head in shame. Expressing his opinion in such an off hand way then back tracking trying to cover his statement. He made it plain and clear, not to mention it was factually incorrect! He should be hammered for it.’ On Twitter Mr Marr was accused of a ‘cock up’ for showing ‘personal bias’. Harry Fowler wrote: ‘Getting his arse handed to him by Salmond…must try harder Mr Marr, a lot f***ing harder.’ Mr Marr was also branded a 'self-important little weasel' and a 'racist wee s****' in comments on . pro-independence online forum, the Telegraph reported. Others said they had complained to the BBC, and posted links to the official complaints page to encourage others to do the same. Nationalist MSP Stewart Maxwell MSP, convener of the Scottish Parliament’s culture committee, said: ‘There are questions for the BBC to answer over their coverage of this issue.’ Pete Wishart MP, the party’s broadcasting spokesman, wrote on Twitter: ‘Thought Alex [Salmond] was very restrained in the face of all that nonsense. Think there'll be consequences for Marr, though.’ A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Andrew himself made it clear on air that he had not been intending to express a personal opinion or that of the BBC, but was simply putting forward an argument from President Barroso who, as European Commission President, has an integral insight within the debate. The BBC's coverage of the Scottish referendum debate has been fair and balanced and we will continue to report on the story without fear or favour.’","Presenter branded 'Tory employee' and 'establishment puppet' after clash .

"A young father has hit the jackpot after digging up two giant gold nuggets worth nearly $200,000. The natural pieces of treasure were discovered on a private property in Tarnagulla, near Bendigo, north of Melbourne and have a combined weight of nearly 140 ounces. Ray Swinnerton, Vice President of the Bendigo Prospecting Club, said he had met the lucky prospector, who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, and not surprisingly was 'overjoyed'. Scroll down for video . The 65 ounce nugget of Tarnagulla gold, one of two found by a young father on his private property, is worth almost $90,000 . The second  nugget was 72 ounces and has a street value of more than $100,000 . Ray Swinnerton, Vice President of the Bendigo Prospecting Club, said the young father was overjoyed about his discovery . ‘He was thrilled when he found it, as you can imagine. He makes a living from this stuff, so a find like that is very exciting,' Mr Swinnerton said. ‘He didn't want to be named until he had sold them off. He’s fairly young and it’s obviously a fair bit of money we’re talking about. ‘It was very unusual. Most of the finds are smaller than a fingernail, so this one is pretty special.' Mr Swinnerton added that gold mining was more of a hobby for most people. ‘Most of us don’t do this for the money. Gold detecting is very expensive,' he said. 'The detector alone is about $7000. I suppose it’s like fishing, in that it’s usually cheaper to go and buy your fish than the costs of catching the fish. We mostly do this for the experience, so a find like that is the bonus of a lifetime.' Selling the gold can also be difficult because a licence is needed to sell to overseas buyers. ‘I believe he has sold one of the nuggets and is preparing to sell the other. To sell gold overseas you need to get a licence which is very difficult to obtain, so it can take a while to sell them within Australia, as there are more affluent people overseas,‘ Mr Swinnerton said.

Kate’s sister Pippa, who writes an accompanying blog called The Party Times, is also taking a risk with a piece entitled Celebrate The Games And Support Team GB which provides links to many of the items on sale. And although the firm is careful to avoid the most blatant breach of the stringent code – mentioning the actual word ‘Olympics’ – if you put Olympics into Party Pieces’ own search engine it takes you to their Celebrate The Games page, which could still be grounds for action.

It sells party bags, fancy dress costumes and games for children’s birthday parties and special occasions from Christmas to Chinese New Year. The firm attracted unwelcome publicity in March 2010 when it published an interview with Kate – then an employee – discussing her tips for the perfect party, alongside a photo. It was swiftly removed after critics pointed out that she had just won damages from a photographic agency for breach of privacy. The website also raised eyebrows with its princess-themed section, though it pre-dates the engagement. Mrs Middleton, 57, a former air hostess, set up Party Pieces in 1987. Her husband, a former British Airways flight dispatcher, helps to run it. Kate worked as a photographer and web designer for the firm for three years until Christmas. Her sister Pippa runs Party Times, an online magazine for her parents’ company which featured in a newspaper magazine two weeks before the engagement. And her brother James, 23, promotes his cake-making business on the website. The finances of Party Pieces are unclear because it trades as a partnership rather than being registered as a company, which would entail lodging accounts with Companies House. But it is thought to have made millions of pounds for the family. And it is not the first time that the Middletons have been accused of unofficially cashing in on events - and their daughters royal connections. In the build up to the Royal Wedding they produced a range of themed items including corgi cake toppers and plastic hats emblazoned with Union Flags. They even launched a pack of Britannia scratch cards on British trivia. And they were accused by Britain's Got Talent of illegally carrying its logo on their website.","It is a criminal offence to capitalise .

"Jack Wilshere is on the hunt for a new agent right now and in the discussions he has had so far he is said to be making certain demands. He wants to know how much money he will make beyond his playing contract at Arsenal:   endorsement deals and such like. And he wants an assurance that any agreement comes with a job for his older brother, Tom, having secured him a position with his previous management company. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Freestyle with Jack Wilshere . Jack's shame: Former Arsenal masseur Kieran Hunt pours champagne into Wilshere's mouth in Las Vegas . Controversy: The England midfielder was seen smoking a cigar and cigarettes given to him by his brother . It’s Tom in the photograph that appeared on the back page of the Daily Mail earlier this week; Tom who appears to be holding a cigarette to his sublimely gifted sibling’s mouth as they enjoy themselves at a pool party in Las Vegas. Never mind that it was only a few days before pre-season training resumed at Arsenal. Never mind that competition for places in the Gunners midfield has rarely appeared more intense. It’s only a cigarette, or a cigar (he was photographed smoking one of those, too), or another cocktail. Their dad, Andy, was there in Las Vegas, so perhaps we shouldn’t blame Tom. This might sound like an over-reaction and a bit unfair. For a start, Wilshere is not exactly alone when it comes to elite athletes who enjoy an occasional puff when they spend most of their lives striving for physical perfection. Stagnated: There are worries about the Arsenal player's progress over the past few years . Return: Wilshere is set to join up with Arsenal for pre-season next week, after his Vegas holiday . More worrying in Wilshere’s case is the fact that this is not the first time it has happened and that the 22-year-old midfielder has failed to act after the first incident — when he expressed remorse having been photographed smoking last October — by making sure he does not find himself in the same position again. It might not have mattered quite so much had Wilshere been reflecting on a marvellous season at Arsenal and a brilliant World Cup. But he wasn’t. He was reflecting on a mediocre, injury-troubled season amid accusations that his career has stood still these past couple of years. Paul Scholes said as much on TV and this week his view was echoed by former Arsenal manager George Graham. Glory: Wilshere won his first silverware for Arsenal last season but faces competition for his place . One club man: the midfielder has been with Arsenal since he was a boy but they fear he is not progressing . ‘His career has not gone anywhere in the last 18 months,’ said Graham before suggesting this latest controversy demanded a dressing down from current Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. And when Wilshere’s own family see no harm in smoking and drinking and there is no agent, at least not at the moment, to pull him into line, it is Wenger’s responsibility to tackle a footballer in danger of wasting his considerable talent. The evidence would suggest he is capable of squandering the gifts he was blessed with and what we  actually have here is yet another great English footballing talent whose career is undermined by  personality flaws. Look at Paul Gascoigne. Look, even, at Wayne Rooney. Potential that, for different reasons, is never quite realised. Mentor: It will be down to Arsene Wenger to take responsibility for Wilshere's personal development . Unimpressive: The youngster had a difficult World Cup, as England crashed out in the Group Stage . Some would consider that to be harsh and not just in the case of the sometimes brilliant Rooney. Only recently, senior FA officials were pleased to report how Wilshere had come of age during England’s brief stay in Brazil this summer. He was said to have been the model professional, applying himself with maturity even when he knew he was excluded from Roy Hodgson’s starting line-up for the opening two group games. His colleagues at Arsenal would also report how dedicated Wilshere was in returning to fitness last summer after finally recovering from a troublesome ankle injury. But in private some of those colleagues have also questioned whether he respects the athletic talent he possesses as much as he should. Lost Vegas: How Wilshere appeared on the back page of the Daily Mail . Plied with champagne: Kieran Hunt (middle row, right (circled)) poured bubbly down Wilshere's neck in Vegas . Whether he is as professional as he needs to be when the modern game places such huge physical demands on the players. Arsenal coaching staff, who regard him as a likeable ‘cheeky chappie’, do not feel his game has progressed in the way it should over the past year and it is acknowledged that this season will be an acid test. There is little doubt he does not respect the position he has as a sporting role model, however  inappropriate it might seem to burden a young man with such responsibility. ‘It’s either arrogance or stupidity but he just doesn’t get it,’ remarked one observer. This week officials at the Emirates Stadium were said to be deeply disappointed by his behaviour. It has not escaped the attention of the same agents he has been courting that he might not appreciate the role he needs to play in securing endorsement deals. Potential: Rooney, like Wilshere, broke onto the scene, and into the England team, at a young age . Struggles: Rooney has never quite lived up to the incredible expectations put upon him . Right now he has lucrative  contracts with Nike and Pepsi but blue-chip brands are unlikely to come running after seeing the images from Las Vegas this week. The detail of Wilshere’s ‘boys’ trip’ is unlikely to impress them, either.  Organised, apparently, around a friend’s stag party at the MGM Grand hotel on the main Las Vegas strip, the trip became more of an England footballer affair when Wilshere discovered Joe Hart and James Milner were also going to be there with friends. They threw a ‘wet and wild’ party, with Wilshere said to have had champagne poured down his throat by former Arsenal masseur Kieran Hunt — a la Gazza and the ‘dentist’s chair’ in Hong Kong in 1996. Wilshere is thought to have hired a whole floor of the hotel, with a pool, and guests were asked to surrender their phones so pictures could not be taken: a strategy that did not exactly pay off. Perhaps Wilshere’s father, a 49-year-old former builder who is fiercely protective of his family, saw no harm in his son letting off a bit of steam. Back on track: The Gunners midfielder posted this more serene picture on Instagram after the controversy . Wasted talent: Paul Gascoigne succumbed to alcohol as he failed to reach his potential . Precedent: Gascoigne mocked his critics by imitating the infamous 'dentists chair' while celebrating a goal . But when Wilshere already has something of a track record for trouble, maybe he would have been  better advising against a  hedonistic hotspot such as  Las Vegas. As far back as August 2010, Wilshere was getting into scrapes. He sparked a nightclub brawl by telling a girl to ditch her boyfriend because he and his friends had ‘more money’. Kimberley Plested broke an elbow when she fell trying to protect boyfriend Dan Farnon as Wilshere’s friends attacked them. The PA, celebrating her 21st birthday at the Amika club in Kensington, said Wilshere kept telling her to join his party before a crude sexual remark sparked a fight. Plested needed metal pins inserted in her arm and Wilshere, who claimed to be the peacemaker in the incident, was given a police caution for common assault while Adam Mardell and Duane Brailsford each pleaded guilty to affray. Caution: Wilshere was in trouble in 2010 for an incident which saw Kimberley Plested break an elbow . Time to shine: With Arsenal's summer spending Wilshere needs to start performing to justify his place . Brailsford, who left Farnon with a gashed eye, also admitted assault. The following March, Wilshere hurled insults at taxi driver Brian Spencer, 64, after realising he was a Tottenham fan. ‘Wilshere’s behaviour is the worst I’ve ever seen in all my time as a cabbie,’ said Spencer. ‘No one deserves to be spat at just because of the team they support. 'He was behaving appallingly, but when he noticed my Spurs hat it got a lot worse. He suddenly started calling me every name under the sun. ‘He walked straight up to me and said, “You’re f*****g taking us”, as he pointed to my cab. When I told him he was too drunk he got even more aggressive and started  screaming at me that I should take him and his mates.’ In that instance Wilshere accepted another police caution and apologised for his behaviour. Wilshere, who now has a young family of his own — a girlfriend and two children — is from a tough, working-class background. During his formative years he would attend Arsenal’s academy in Hale End and the coaches who worked with him remember what a wonderful young player he was: head and shoulders above other kids his age. He would often play with youngsters two years above his age group. Fan favourite: The Gunners star is still very popular with the club's fans despite a disappointing season . Pain: Injuries have blighted the young star's early career but he should be fit for the new season . At that stage he did everything right, focusing on football. The only negative was that his coaches did not think he would be captain material because he wanted the ball too much and was too involved in the game to be able to organise other things. But they knew as long ago as when he was 13 that he was destined to become an Arsenal player — and an England international. One of his early coaches believes Wilshere has lost his innocence about only wanting to play football and feels he has been caught up too much in stuff away from the game. However, the coach claims every talented young player goes through that period and that Wilshere needs to realise what is important. On one wall at Hale End a photograph has pride of place. It is a teenage Wilshere staring in awe at Diego Maradona. One only hopes he admires Maradona more for his genius than his own, hell-raising behaviour — and recognises that before Maradona’s fall he enjoyed quite a rise.","Ex-Arsenal masseur plied him with champagne .

"The man who predicted the 1987 stock market crash and the recent global economic recession believes the worst crash in decades will take place later in the next 12 months. Dr Marc Faber, a Swiss investor and the author of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report, said the cause of the crash would be overvaluing of companies within the internet and biotechnology sectors – thought to include the $400billion valuation of Google, and the $100billion valuation of Facebook. He also said the market was also beginning to wake up to the idea that the U.S. Federal Reserve is a ‘clueless organisation’ – something he says is starting to affect confidence levels in investors. Cost: Dr Marc Faber said the cause of the ''87-type crash' he is predicting would be wild overvaluing of companies within the internet and biotechnology sectors . Speaking to CNBC last night, Dr Faber said: ‘I think it's very likely that we're seeing, in the next 12 months, an '87-type of crash’… and I suspect It will be even worse.’ His comments came as the Nasdaq suffered its biggest drop in two-and-a-half years after another sharp selloff in biotechnology businesses - including Gilead Sciences and TripAdvisor. The Nasdaq biotechnology index shed 5.6 per cent of its value - its biggest one-day drop since August 2011 - increasing investor anxiety about a broader pullback in technology businesses. Speaking of overvaluations in the technology sector, Dr Faber told CNBC's Futures Now programme: 'I think there are some groups of stocks that are highly vulnerable because they're in cuckoo land in terms of valuations.' 'They have no earnings. They're valued at price-to-sales. And this is not a good metric in the long run,' he added. High values: In August last year the social network Facebook was valued at a staggering $100billion . Fall: Dr Faber's comments came as the Nasdaq suffered its biggest drop in two-and-a-half years after another sharp selloff in biotechnology businesses - including Gilead Sciences and TripAdvisor . Dr Faber said overvaluations would not be the only cause of the ''87-type of crash' he is predicting, adding that the U.S. Federal Reserve would have to shoulder just as much blame. 'I believe that the market is slowly waking up to the fact that the Federal Reserve is a clueless organization...They have no idea what they're doing. And so the confidence level of investors is diminishing, in my view ' Dr Faber said. He said that as investors come to terms with the Federal Reserve's failings, the market will experience a decline by 20 or 30 per cent. Despite Dr Faber's track record for predicting economic crises, there are many that disagree with his conclusion that 'now is not a good time to buy stocks'. Just last week Bill Miller - the legendary stockpicker and chairman and chief investment officer at Legg Mason Capital Management - said the conditions for a bad market 'simply do not exist'. Dr Faber also made a prediction last August that a stock market crash was imminent, but S&P 500 stock prices have remained around 9 per cent high since that announcement.","Dr Marc Faber, a Swiss investor, says an '87-type crash' is coming .

"Strikes by Home Office staff at Britain's borders aimed at paralysing airports during London 2012 are not justifiable or right, David Cameron has said. The Prime Minister today waded into the row after thousands of immigration staff voted to walk out over jobs, pay and other issues. Members of the Public and Commercial Services Union could go on strike within a week, it was announced last night. Concerns: Fears of travel chaos during the Olympics have been raised after thousands of staff at the Home Office - including airport immigration workers - voted to go on strike . Mr Cameron, who is in Kabul, Afghanistan, said this morning: 'There was a 20 per cent turn out and a very narrow margin.' He added that strike action should not take place, adding: 'I do not think it would be right, I do not think it would be justifiable.' Union sources said the strike would be . timed to cause ‘maximum pain’. Critics accused union bosses of ‘deeply . unpatriotic’ behaviour. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said 57% of its members had backed a campaign of action in protest at 'cuts'. While 16,000 PCS members in the Home Office were balloted, with a 57% vote for strikes and 75% majority for other forms of action, the turnout was just 20%. Barely . 11 per cent of PCS union members at the Home Office voted in favour of . the walkout in protest over cuts to jobs and pay freezes. That amounts . to just 1,800 people out of 16,000 potential voters. Anger: The Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said ministers have known about issues concerning members of his union but have chosen not to act . Dominic . Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘For Mark Serwotka [PCS . general secretary] to threaten to target the Olympics when just 11 per . cent of his own members back a strike is self-indulgent, reckless and . deeply unpatriotic. ‘There . is no credible basis for this vindictive strike action – a militant . minority led by a union head-banger should not be allowed to paralyse . the Games.’ Most Olympic athletes, who were given dedicated fast track immigration lanes, are expected to be here by the end of this week. But next week ports and airports are braced for the main influx of Games visitors from overseas. Heathrow is expecting to handle around 120,000 arrivals each day next week. Union bosses will meet tomorrow to set . dates for one or more days of strikes during the summer and autumn. Any . strike before the opening ceremony on July 27 would be hugely . disruptive. A union source said: ‘We will target . those areas which will cause maximum pain for the employer but minimise . the impact for our employees taking long periods of strike action. They . have made the dispute about the Olympics with the way they have gone . about using temporary staff so they can staff all the desks during the . Games.’ A walkout within the coming months . could also hit hundreds of thousands of families heading overseas for . their summer holiday. Many schools break up on Friday. Worrying: It is thought any strike just before the opening ceremony of the Olympics on July 27 could have a big impact on people travelling to the UK to watch the event . PCS members make up around 5,000 out of 8,000 Border Force staff who check passports at ports and airports. Ministers have pledged that every immigration post at Heathrow will be manned during the busy summer period to combat the huge queues and delays seen at the airport this spring. But this promise will be extremely difficult to meet if thousands of PCS members walk out. The strike will also affect staff in the Passport Agency, Criminal Records Bureau and the main Home Office. Immigration Minister Damian Green said: . 'I call on the union to call off this . irresponsible proposed strike. A decision to strike is completely . unacceptable and we believe the public will have no sympathy with the . union's decision. 'Only about 1 in 10 PCS members voted . for strike action. The union leadership has no authority to call . disruptive strikes on that basis and should think again. 'The security of the UK border is of . the utmost importance and we will use our trained pool of contingency . staff to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union . action. 'Any action that disrupts the Olympics will be completely unacceptable and the public will not support it.' Some 16,000 PCS members in the Home Office were balloted, and turnout was just 20 per cent, meaning some 3,200 voted. Of those, just 57 per cent voted in favour of strikes, or around 1,830 people. Three quarters of those who did vote backed other forms of industrial action, such as working to rule and refusing to work overtime. Mr Serwotka claimed ministers were undermining the Home Office’s ability to provide ‘vital public services’. He said: ‘Ministers have known about these issues for a very long time but have chosen not to act. ‘We believe they have acted recklessly and irresponsibly in cutting so many jobs and, in the case of the UK Border Agency, they have simply tried to paper over the cracks by deploying severely undertrained staff at our borders. ‘If these issues are not resolved, they threaten to seriously undermine the Home Office’s ability to provide vital public services.' London bus workers have voted to accept an offer of an Olympics bonus, ending the threat of another strike. The Unite union said workers will get £577 in recognition of the 'massive increase' in workload over the Games. Thousands of bus workers went on strike last month and were threatening further walkouts. In workplace ballots held yesterday 71 per cent voted to accept the offer. The bus workers will get a payment of £27.50 each time they complete a . duty over the 29 days of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The . average number of duties workers will complete will be 21, meaning most . workers will get a £577 award. Peter Kavanagh, Unite's regional secretary for London, said: 'After . almost a year-long campaign, bus workers finally have a fair deal which . recognises their contribution to keeping London moving over the . Olympics.'","David Cameron says only 20% of the Public and Commercial Services union turned out for vote so strike lacks credibility .

"A baby born in the North West of England will live on average two years less than a child born in the South East, new Government figures have revealed. The figures give a snapshot of life in Britain today and reveal the divisions between life-expectancy rates for people living in different areas of Britain. Following the release of the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, while people may not live as long, a typical house in the North West costs around half as much as a property 200 miles to the south. A nation of contrasts: London has a younger population and generates more income than the North East . People in the North West of England live on average two years less than those in the South East . Friends relax in the Oxfordshire sunshine . The Independent also highlighted the economic unbalance of London in comparison to the rest of the country. London currently generates one fifth of the country's output. The capital also has the greatest amount of young people, with a median age of 34, compared to the national average of 40. England's South West is clearly the retirement hotspot of the country, with an average age of 42.9 years. The worst place to live in terms of unemployment is the North-East of England where 10.3 per cent of the population are out of work. This compares to the national average unemployment rate, which stands at 7.3 per cent. But the area with the greatest number of unqualified adults is the West Midlands at 13.9 per cent. House prices are still on the rise according to the figures, with Yorkshire and Humber being the only area that recorded a drop of 0.2 per cent. But overall crime estimated by the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) in the year ending June 2013 fell 7 percent  compared with the previous year. This figure, which is an estimate is the lowest since the survey began in 1981. The number of crimes recorded by the police in the year to June 2013 fell by percent.","London has the greatest number of young people with a median age of 34 .

"Glad to be alive: Performance poet Benjamin Zephaniah was just 45 minutes from death after suffering acute appendicitis . Lying on a hospital trolley,  his stomach gripped by spasmodic episodes of searing pain, Benjamin Zephaniah expected the journey to the operating theatre to be his last. Diagnosed with appendicitis and warned of the possibility that he could be suffering from septicaemia (blood poisoning), the poet and writer knew the outcome looked bleak. ‘I just remember lying there thinking I could die here. But strangely, I didn’t mind for myself,’  he says. ‘I told myself I’d had a good life. ‘But then I kept thinking of my poor mum, who used to be a nurse and still volunteers as a hospital visitor in Birmingham. 'I’m one of eight brothers and sisters  and we’re so close. What would she do? This would break her heart.’ Fortunately, no one had to break such calamitous news to Mrs Zephaniah – even though doctors later told her 53-year-old son that he had been 45 minutes from death because of the advanced stage of his condition. But speaking for the first time about nearly losing his life, Benjamin – known to a new generation through his role  in BBC series Peaky Blinders – does dwell on the irony that his non-drinking, non-smoking, exercise-loving vegan lifestyle gave him no protection from appendicitis, which randomly affects six in every 100 people in the UK. What’s more, unlike Sir Elton John, who last year had his appendix out after two weeks of serious pain, he was given no advance warning. The day of the trauma – March 22, 2012 – started like any other. Benjamin, professor of poetry at Brunel University in West London, had been lecturing students on novel writing when he felt a ‘little pop’ in his stomach. ‘I didn’t think anything of it,’ says Benjamin, who broke into the literary world while performing dub poetry alongside stand-up comedians and punk bands in 1980s London. ‘However, over the next few hours I started to feel slightly nauseous and I had a vague stitch in my right-hand side. I thought maybe it had just been a long day. 'Then as the pains started to get a little worse, I thought I had some kind of food poisoning since it reminded me of how I felt when I once ate an out-of-date can of pineapples.’ Back in his hotel room – his home is in Lincolnshire – he tried to sleep off the now escalating pain and sickness. Get it out: How an appendix is removed during an operation . ‘By about 6.30am, the pain was so bad that I was almost hallucinating. Somehow, I reached for the phone to call reception for help, but as I picked up the receiver I couldn’t speak. The receptionist must have heard me panting down the phone and raced upstairs. When I didn’t answer the door, he got someone to kick it down.’ He was rushed to Hillingdon Hospital and recalls a young doctor smiling over him. ‘She looked about 17, and the first thing she said was, “I’ve just read one of your novels.” I think she was trying to calm me down as she then told me I had suspected appendicitis and they needed to get me on the operating table – fast.’ The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch connected to the large intestine which sits in the lower right side of the stomach. An evolutionary throwback, it is ‘absolutely useless’, says surgeon Sanjay Agrawal of Homerton University Hospital in London and BMI London Independent Hospital. However, if it becomes inflamed it must be removed urgently. Left untreated, the appendix can become abscessed, then gangrenous and burst, releasing poison into the abdomen, causing peritonitis – inflammation of the lining of the abdomen – which can spread rapidly to the rest of the body. Appendicitis is most common in people aged ten to 19 but can happen at any age, and it remains the most common reason for emergency surgery. Appendicitis: If the appendix becomes inflamed it needs to be removed immediately . Agrawal says: ‘Appendicitis is usually triggered by a blockage at the entrance of the appendix which can then become inflamed. 'It can happen to anyone – there isn’t anything that makes one person more or less vulnerable.’ Sometimes, he says, the condition can be overlooked in its early stages, possibly confused with gastroenteritis, gallstones, or a urinary tract infection. 'There is only one treatment – removing the appendix, either through keyhole or open surgery. ‘It can take from 20 minutes to three hours depending on what the surgeon finds – such as a lot of infection,’ says Agrawal. ‘I have done one through open surgery in 12 minutes.’ Benjamin was told his operation would begin with keyhole surgery but if the appendix burst they would need to open him up to reach infected areas. With keyhole surgery, three small incisions are made – one near the belly button, one about 1in long in the lower right of the stomach, and then a tiny incision in the middle of the bikini line. A camera is placed through one incision to assess the state of the appendix. Then it is carefully removed through the port on the right side of the stomach. Benjamin recalls: ‘I didn’t care how they did it. I wasn’t in a place to make decisions. Anyway, they gave me morphine and it all started to get a bit surreal. I remember the anaesthetist being this rather prim but kindly Miss Marple character while the theatre nurse was  a guy from Trinidad who kept up an optimistic patois, saying things like, “Tell me a poem, man.” ’ Although the appendix had ruptured, it had not burst. However, Benjamin was told it had been a close call. ‘It was almost ready to burst. My surgeon told me that had I waited another 45 minutes for help, I’d have been a dead man. Those words still play round and round my head – how close I was to not making it. ‘When I came round, I just thought, wow, I’m still here. What was incredible was that there were three of my students by my bed. They’d bought me fruit and Caribbean patties. I was so touched. The head of my department phoned and I burst into tears. I was glad to be alive.’ Benjamin spent two days in hospital, and then two weeks in Brunel recuperating before returning home. ‘Putting my key in the door was an emotional moment,’ he says. ‘At one point there was a chance I’d never come back. I also couldn’t help thinking how great the NHS had been. They cured me, and not one person asked me to write a cheque.’ Now fully recovered, the only manifestation of his ordeal are three small but fading scars. He continues to practise tai chi and yoga and always starts the day with an hour of aerobic exercise, such as cycling. He breakfasts on muesli and fruit and then eats nothing until about 6pm, when he enjoys a tasty vegan dish such as butter bean stew. Benjamin says: ‘I never took life for granted, but what this has taught me  is that if I have the slightest twinge of inspiration, then I go for it. Everyone should feel this way. ‘Don’t wait until you’re challenged to do the same.’","Benjamin Zephaniah is a teetotal, super-fit, non-smoking vegan .

"To the trained eye, this 'penguin' is clearly a machine - but that hasn't stopped it fooling and infiltrating a large group of notoriously shy emperor penguins. Biologists are using the penguin rover to approach the group and learn more about their feeding habits, health, and interactions. And it is so convincing, penguins in the group were spotted talking to it, as if it was a potential mate for their chicks. Scroll down for video . Scientists have created a remote control rover (pictured), disguised as an emperor penguin chick. The device was designed to snuggle up to shy penguins and track their health. The baby penguin robotic spy lets scientists check heart rate, stress levels and other penguin parameters . Emperor penguins are difficult to study because they are shy and easily intimidated. When researchers approach, these penguins typically back away and the stress of the encounter causes their heart rates to increase. Emperors are the largest species of penguins, and an average bird grows to almost 4ft (1.1 metres) tall. LIke all penguins, the animals can't fly. Emperors live on the Antarctic ice and have developed so-called cooperative behaviours to handle the harsh winds and low temperatures. For example, the birds huddle together to protect themselves from the wind and conserve energy. Individuals take turns moving into the centre of the group, before moving to the outside when it has warmed up. Females lay a single egg before leaving the male to look after it as she goes hunting. At sea, emperor penguins can dive to 1,850 feet (565 meters) for krill and other fish - and can stay underwater for more than 20 minutes. Mothers can be away for up to two months, and when they return they regurgitate the food into the newly hatched chicks' mouths. The males then go hunting. To monitor the birds' health, without causing them unnecessary stress, a group of scientists and filmmakers, led by Yvon Le Maho from the University of Strasbourg in France, created the remote-controlled rover, disguised as a chick. The penguins themselves were fitted with heart-rate loggers. The experiment took place in Adelie Land, Antarctica - the same place where the 2005 documentary 'March of the Penguins' was filmed. After sending the rover into the group, researchers watched from a distance of 650 feet (198 metres) away. The first disguised version of the rover, made of fiberglass, scared the real birds, Professor Le Maho said. In total, the researchers experimented with five more versions of the rover before finding a design that worked. The rover is covered in grey fur, has black arms and a black-and-white painted face, plus a black beak. It is fitted with cameras and sensors that connect to the researchers' computers. The penguins didn't scamper away and even sang to it with 'a very special song like a trumpet,' Professor Le Maho said. Professor Le Maho suggested that the adult penguins were trying to find a mate for their chicks and they were listening for a response, but researchers didn't program the rover to make a sound.

Researcher Yvon Le Maho (pictured) tried five versions of robotic penguins during tests . 'They were very disappointed when there was no answer,' he said. 'Next time we will have a rover playing songs.' At other times, the rover crowded in with a group of chicks, acting as 'a spy in the huddle,' Professor Le Maho continued. Researchers worry that just by coming close to some shy animals they change their behavior and can taint the results of their studies. A number of rovers are being used, and a similar model was seen in the BBC series Spy In The Huddle. Professor Le Maho also used a rover without any animal disguise to spy on king penguins and elephant seals, because those animals don't flee strangers. The king penguins attacked the small rover with their beaks, unless it stayed still, but even that allowed the device to get close enough to get readings. The large  elephant seals didn't budge when the rover zipped by and around them. In the future, the researchers plan to use a more autonomous robot to spy on the emperor penguins. The idea is to use devices on the rover to read signals from radio tags on the birds. The study is published in the journal Nature Methods. Experts also used a rover without any disguise to spy on king penguins and elephant seals. The undisguised rover is shown approaching an incubating king penguin (top left), that has been fitted with a heart rate (HR) logger.

"A pregnant Congresswoman who has been told by doctors not to travel has been refused permission to vote by proxy by Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi - who herself accused reporters of sexism for asking about her future. Illinois Democrat Rep. Tammy Duckworth is in the final weeks of her pregnancy. A double amputee Iraq war veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter came under fire, the 46-year-old had asked for the ability to stay in Illinois to vote. But despite her doctor's orders, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other bigwigs killed a proposal Thursday that would have let her participate remotely. Hours earlier, Pelosi loudly questioned the motives of a female reporter who asked her whether the Dems' Nov. 4 drubbing might lead her to step down from her leadership post. 'As a woman, is there a message here?' the 74-year-old Californian asked. 'When was the day that any of you said to Mitch McConnell, when they lost the Senate three times in a row … ""Aren't you getting a little old Mitch? Shouldn't you step aside?"" Have any of you ever asked him that question?' On the other side of the Capitol, another reporter was asking Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who is of the same gender as McConnell, whether he would step down after his party lost nine seats. Scroll down for video . WAR ON WOMEN?: Rep. Tammy Duckworth won't be allowed to participate in House Democratic leadership elections next week . 'AS A WOMAN ...': Nancy Pelosi spearheaded a move to deny a pregnant colleague a proxy vote in party elections just hours after playing her feminism card when a reporter asked her if she would give up her own leadership post . Duckworth wrote to House Democrats: 'I write to request your assistance regarding upcoming votes for our Caucus. As you are aware, I am in the final weeks of my pregnancy, and have been instructed by my physician not to travel. As a result, I will not be attending the upcoming Caucus meetings in person.' 'I would like to request a proxy vote on the upcoming leadership and ranking member elections that will come before the Caucus in the coming weeks.' Duckworth's fellow Illinoisan Jan Schakowsky made a motion to grant the request but Pelosi and Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who co-chairs the Democratic Steering and Police Committee, objected, according to National Journal. When Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin made a similar request for a proxy vote so she could attend a funeral on Tuesday, the room turned against Duckworth. DeLauro spokeswoman Sara Leonardo told National Journal that her boss 'does not want to set a precedent. There are many meritorious situations where the argument could be made for a waiver, including Congresswoman Duckworth's. The question is, how do you choose?.' There may be an ulterior motive behind Pelosi's opposition to a pregnant colleague being allowed to bend the rules, however: The ranking minority slot in the House Energy Committee is up for grabs with the retirement of congressional lifer Henry Waxman, and Pelosi knows how tight the vote will be. She is backing Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, while Minority Whip Steny Hoyer wants New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone to win the post. Duckworth is in the Pallone camp. One senior aide told National Journal that House Democrats are playing favorites. NO FAVORS: Rep. Gwen Moore (left) also wanted a proxy vote while she attended a funeral, but rules maven Rep. Rosa DeLauro (right) argued against it . Hours before denying Duckworth a vote, Pelosi lectured a reporter for questioning her future leadership – insisting she never would have challenged a male lawmaker . Proxy-proxy battle: Anna Eshoo (left) and Frank Pallone (right) are battling for a key committee post – and Pelosi and Duckworth are on opposite sides of the squabble . Three members whose re-election contests are still up in the air are being allowed to vote, even though ballot-counting is still underway and they might not keep their seats. 'But here you have a woman, a decorated war veteran who is undergoing a high-risk pregnancy, and they can't suspend the rules,' the staffer said. There is no precedent for House Democrats allowing proxy votes in a leadership election, but Senate Democrats have permitted it at least once. Louisiana Sen. Russell Long was permitted to vote in the Senate Majority Whip election in 1971 from his deathbed, choosing West Virginian Robert Byrd over Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy as he suffered from lung disease. Byrd, who ultimately won, mistakenly thought it would be a close race, and argued for Long to have a vote.","Minority leader killed request from pregnant war hero Tammy Duckworth to cast party leadership votes remotely since doctor says she can't travel .

"Lucky to be alive: Lee Cowden, with daughters Ruby (left) and Molly (left),  lives to tell of her ordeal . The weekend had been perfect: the sun had shone and the charming cottage they had rented in rural Norfolk had provided a much-needed break after months of gruelling IVF treatment. Coming home, however, the roads were so choked with holiday traffic, Lee Cowden and her husband Iain had decided to take a scenic detour, making the journey to Surrey much longer than expected. So when Lee, then 26, walked through the front door she went straight to bed. But instead of drifting off to sleep, the music therapist suddenly found herself feeling breathless as a strange tingling sensation began shooting down her left arm. Within a few moments, an excruciating pain gripped her left shoulder. ‘I kept gasping,’ says Lee. ‘Iain and I were terrified. I had no idea what was happening and Iain ran to call an ambulance.’ Within hours, Lee, who doesn’t smoke or drink, was in intensive care in St George’s Hospital in London, having suffered a major heart attack caused by a blood clot. She says: ‘I remember lying there, strapped to monitors, thinking “How did I get here, what am I doing here?”’ The doctors had no idea what had caused it — Lee had never suffered any cardiac problems before. It was only two days later, when she mentioned she was in the middle of IVF treatment, having already had three failed cycles, that the penny dropped. ‘They told me blood clots are a potential complication of IVF drugs,’ she says. ‘Sitting in the car for hours had caused a blood clot, which had moved to my heart. ‘I was horrified. The IVF had been bad enough but now, all I could think was what chance did I have of conceiving after a heart attack? I just couldn’t stop crying. ‘I couldn’t understand why no one had told me this could happen. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have spent hours sitting in a car.’ The news got worse: the attack had caused a small hole in her heart, which had to be surgically repaired. Doctors advised Lee to wait another nine months before having any more fertility treatment, to avoid putting her body under more strain. ‘It was a desperate time,’ says Lee, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. ‘It seemed the very treatment that was supposed to help me achieve my dream was cruelly taking it away from me.’ Lee had needed IVF because she suffered from polycystic ovary syndrome, which made it difficult to get pregnant naturally. ‘I was never told that by having IVF I was putting my health at risk,’ she says. ‘In fact, when nothing happened after the first two cycles, the doctors simply doubled the dosage of fertility drugs.’ Lee’s story sits uneasily with the much-peddled notion that IVF is a safe way to have a baby. Instead, stories like hers raise the terrifying question of whether some IVF clinics are cynically capitalising on women’s desire for a baby, without paying due care to their health. Scroll down for video . Miracle: Lee with newborn baby Molly, who she finally gave birth to after she was left with a hole in her heart as a result of several rounds of IVF treatment . The drive for high success rates — and reassuring statistics to ‘sell’ to prospective clients — raises fears that some clinics are reckless in their willingness to pump drugs into their patients. Around 45,000 IVF cycles are performed in the UK every year to help the one in six couples who suffer from infertility. It’s free on the NHS in some areas, but private clinics charge around £5,000 for a single treatment. The process usually involves injecting stimulating drugs for two weeks so that the woman’s ovaries produce as many eggs as possible — usually 20 to 30. These are then fertilised before being implanted into the womb. It’s thought that the more eggs that can be harvested in a single procedure, the better: any spare embryos can be frozen for use at a later date. ""Blood specialists warned us there was a risk but nobody told us that IVF could be life-threatening"" Peter Draper . Yet it seems not all women are warned of the serious risks — including death — that can result. Last year, a Swedish study found women who get pregnant through IVF are almost twice as likely to develop potentially fatal blood clots because of the drugs used. Deep vein thrombosis happens to four women per 1,000 who get pregnant through IVF. The risks are very real. In 2012, Emma Draper, 26, from Dagenham in Essex, died from a massive stroke, triggered by a clot, just weeks after getting pregnant through IVF. She was already receiving treatment for a condition called anti-phospholipid syndrome, which makes the blood prone to clotting, but her family say she wasn’t aware her IVF could prove fatal as it can also increase the risk. Her husband Peter said: ‘Blood specialists warned us there was a risk of clotting from changing Emma’s medication, but nobody told us that IVF could be life-threatening.’ Regardless of how they conceive, all women are more prone to clots in pregnancy as the blood tends to coagulate more easily. However, IVF carries an extra risk because it can result in ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) which again raises the chance of a clot. OHSS is caused by the body over-reacting to the drugs used to stimulate the production of eggs. It’s surprisingly common, affecting women after around one in ten cycles of IVF drugs. Tragic: Emma Draper, pictured with husband Peter, died of a stroke just after getting pregnant through IVF . ‘The problem with over-stimulating the ovaries is that this, in turn, produces larger amounts of the hormone oestrogen,’ explains Leila Hanna, consultant gynaecologist and medical director of Chelsfield Park Hospital in Orpington, Kent. ‘Increased amounts of oestrogen can make the blood thicken and could cause it to clot. ‘Certain women are particularly vulnerable to OHSS such as those who suffer with polycystic ovary syndrome, and those under 35.’ And OHSS can also lead to other complications. Katie Preston, who needed IVF because of her husband Matthew’s low sperm count, was 15 weeks pregnant when she began suffering agonising pains in her left side. ‘I felt like a knife twisting inside me,’ says the 27-year-old, from Birmingham. ‘All I could think was “please save my baby and make this stop”. I felt I’d done the hard part by getting pregnant. We were absolutely desperate to have a family — I couldn’t lose my baby now.’ Agonising: Katie Preston, 27, suffered painful ovarian torsion after undergoing rounds of IVF treatment . She was rushed into hospital one Sunday and diagnosed with ovarian torsion, where heavy doses of IVF drugs cause cysts to develop on an ovary and twist it out of position. Surgeons immediately removed Katie’s left ovary and fallopian tube but she had to wait an agonising 24 hours before discovering if the baby had survived as the scan clinic was closed for the weekend. ‘I was utterly overwhelmed when I discovered the baby was OK,’ she says, ‘but the rest of the pregnancy was awful. I could hardly stand up for about five weeks because of the surgery.’ Thankfully, baby Ethan was born healthy after a three-hour labour. ‘I felt absolutely overwhelmed with love for him. I’ve never felt such happiness,’ says Katie. ‘I couldn’t stop looking at him in wonder and thinking “It’s over, I’m finally a mum”,’ she says. ‘All that hurt and frustration and misery just melted away and all my husband could say was “My son, my son”.’ But consultant gynaecologist Professor Geeta Nargund believes many women are suffering unnecessarily and don’t need to be given huge amounts of drugs. Relief: Katie couldn't believe it when she gave birth to  Ethan though she had to have her left ovary removed . She practises ‘natural’ IVF at the Create Fertility Clinic, and doesn’t try to boost egg production with drugs, instead harvesting the eggs that a woman produces naturally. If that doesn’t work, they use a low-dose stimulant for just a few days to produce between two and seven eggs, not the usual 20 to 30. She says: ‘By not stimulating the ovaries, we get the strongest eggs, the ones chosen by the body as most suitable for fertilisation. ‘By looking at the quality of a woman’s eggs, not the quantity, we can give her the greatest chance of success while minimising the risks.’ Following her horrific experience with IVF, Lee Cowden eventually gave birth to a healthy baby, Molly, who’s now seven, after undergoing ‘natural’ treatment, along with low doses of fertility drugs. ‘Even now I struggle to find the words to describe that moment,’ she says. ‘I never, ever imagined that I’d hold my own baby in my arms. And then she was here.’ Incredibly, 16 months later, Lee discovered she was pregnant again, this time thanks to Mother Nature. It seems her ovaries were naturally stimulated by Molly’s arrival and started working normally. Her second daughter, Ruby, is now five. But despite this, Lee remains angered by how little information is given to some women about the possible health risks of IVF. ‘When you have IVF, it’s all-consuming, you can’t think about anything else,’ she says. ‘The sheer volume of drugs you take is massive — I had horrible mood swings and I remember once dropping a vial of one of the drugs on the floor by accident and going crazy. ‘The stress on my relationship was massive. And then I had a heart attack, which nearly killed me. ‘Yet Molly is the proof that women don’t need to be pumped with heavy doses of these drugs and doctors shouldn’t take such a cavalier attitude as they seem to do now. ‘They have to rethink their methods. No woman should be allowed to die just because she’s desperate for a baby.’","After intense treatment Lee Cowden's relaxing break turned into a nightmare .

"Last week I endured of hellish day of work pressures, domestic distractions and a banging headache. It reached a crescendo when I served my family a burnt dinner, which my children pulled faces at and pushed around their plates before asking to be excused from the table. Having finally cleared away the dishes, I knew only a long soak in a frothy bath could offer any hope of respite. As I poured bubble bath into the warm water and stripped off my clothes, I breathed deeply and instantly felt more relaxed. harsh critic: Angela with her daughter Sophie, ten . Yet my peace was shattered when my ten-year-old daughter, Sophie, marched into the bathroom with the unapologetic authority of a conquering army. ‘Mummy, I forgot to tell you I need a packed lunch tomorrow and . . . oh.’ The runaway narrative suddenly screeched to a halt, as she stopped to survey my unclothed form. Irritated by her unflinching perusal of my birthday suit, I quickly stepped into the bath and slid under the foam. But judging by her creased brow and steely glare, my daughter’s mind had moved beyond thoughts of whether she should have cheese or peanut butter in her sandwiches. And though I sensed I was inviting disaster, I couldn’t help myself. ‘What is it?’ I rasped, trying to cap my irritation. ‘What are you looking at?’ ‘You, Mummy. You just look . . . err .. .’ Holding my breath, I waited for the killer adjective. Looked what? Cold? Annoyed? Psychotic? But it was worse. Oh, much, much worse. ‘Sorry Mummy, but you look so, err, floppy’ Floppy? Floppy? If ever there was a word a naked woman wants to have expunged from the English language, then floppy has to be it. That is unless we’re talking sagging sofas or old straw hats. Certainly, it should be illegal to use as part of a little girl’s forensic analysis of her mother’s body — especially when her mother’s chest is on the larger side. But looking down at the pendulous breasts just peeking out from the foamy bubbles, I silently conceded that Sophie had a point. It’s just that she is the only person brave — and cheeky — enough to vocalise the harsh truth about my mid-life body. At that very moment I decided there was only one thing for it; I would never let my daughter see my naked body again. Whenever there is discussion about parental nudity, the focus understandably rests on the father/daughter, mother/son dynamic, since it is bound up with a child’s burgeoning sexuality. Indeed my husband Martin began covering up whenever Sophie was around about five years ago. And by the time Sophie’s three brothers, now 21, 19 and 15, had reached the age of two, I was always at least partially clothed around them. As nature intended: Angela thought her nakedness would help Sophie understand her own development . However, with Sophie things always felt different. After all, she was a girl, she was born with the same bits as me. My nakedness was, I felt, a natural way for her to come to understand her own physical development. It was also a way to counter the many damaging influences young women are subjected to. I wanted her to learn that to be beautiful you do not need to be slender to the point of emaciation. And I wanted her to understand that nudity is not always sexual. So I didn’t mind her seeing me as nature intended. She’d bound into my room in the morning and sit chattering to me while I got dressed, and trail after me into the bathroom when I went to have a shower in the evening, wittering away about her day as I washed. For the past few years, we’ve taken a winter holiday at a lovely hotel on the Red Sea. The bedroom has a sunken Jacuzzi on its balcony, and each night, Sophie and I would fill this expansive tub with lashings of bubbles, strip naked and bathe under the stars, chatting about the day’s events. I felt totally at ease being undressed in front of her, and she never passed comment on my body. But in recent months, I’ve noticed that Sophie has become more critical in her appraisal of my naked form. Brutally candid in the way that only children are, she sees, and therefore she comments. Partly because she is getting older and more aware of her own body. And partly because she soaks up the body-conscious, over-sexualised imagery of fashion and pop music like a little sponge. Not from Sophie will you ever receive the kindly reassurance that as adults we expect from a close friend. Instead, she delivers her unvarnished appraisal about the way I look whether I’ve got clothes on or not. Only 10 per cent of British women feel confident naked, according to a recent survey . I don’t mind comments about the colour of my shoes or whether a dress looks ‘lumpy’ (I remind myself this comes from a pint-sized fashionista who thinks a One Direction ra-ra skirt is the height of couture). However her views on my naked form are much more hurtful. Why? Because she is vocalising the gloomy thoughts which roll on a loop through the back of my mind about the saggy, blubbery body which has taken the place of my once-lithe physique. Candour: It's important to feel comfortable in one's own skin, says Angela . In short, the truth hurts. Don’t get me wrong. Sophie is never motivated by spite. Sophie is an affectionate little girl, who constantly tells me how much she loves me. But being affectionate and honest are not, for Sophie, diametrically opposed. She has yet to learn the art of lying which is perfected by most adult women. She is yet to understand that it is almost de rigueur to continually offer false reassurance to fellow females. Recently I caught her casting a practised eye over my naked body as I squeezed myself into a bikini. I heard the sigh of despair through her pursed little lips before she blurted: ‘Mummy, please tell me you’re not going to wear that. It’s just too . . . young.’ Ouch. What did she mean, I demanded? She fought to articulate her thoughts, saying there was just too much, floppy — that word again! — flesh on show for someone ‘of my age’. Of course I want my daughter to be able to form and express opinions, but I wish she didn’t have such a knack for putting a verbal knife through my heart. Yet, there is also redemption. Too many young girls are vulnerable to body issues. Especially when one survey recently revealed that a generation of adolescent girls could fail to fulfil their professional potential because they are suffering from low self-esteem about their appearance. Or that one in four females aged between 11 and 17 are weighed down by pressure to conform to an ‘ideal notion’ of how they should look, another survey suggested. So what Sophie’s candour has allowed me to do is turn this notion on its head, gifting it back in messages about how I don’t care what she thinks of my body, that it’s important to feel comfortable in one’s own skin, and not listen to what others say about appearance. And I’ll keep peddling those messages. I just won’t let my daughter see me naked before we have such a discussion.","When Sophie saw her mother Angela naked, she described her as 'floppy'

"Apple was hailed for pioneering a 'listening revolution' as it celebrated a decade of iTunes today. The music store, which started out more than a decade ago with 200,000 songs, reached its 25 billionth download earlier this year. Since its launch on April 28 2003, iTunes has accrued a catalogue of more than 35 million songs and has around 435 million active account-holders across the world. Adele's Someone Like You is the most downloaded song in the UK, selling more than 1.46 million copies. Run, by Leona Lewis, was the first song to top the UK charts on downloads alone. 1.

Pocket-lint, it would take more than 140,000 years to listen to every . single music download available through the famous store. Gennaro Castaldo, of HMV, said the . music store - along with the iPod - had 'undoubtedly' played a major . part in changing the way consumers discover and listen to music. 'Between them, they've helped to reshape . the music landscape. ""In the process creating a commercially viable . model for digital technology in much the same way the gramophone did for . recordings some 100 years ago,"" he said. ""The challenge for Apple now is that . digital consumers appear to be moving away from owned downloads to . streaming, and there are now a growing number of competitors all looking . to challenge their market dominance. 'Demand for physical product also . remains surprisingly resilient and there's even been a mini-resurgence . for formats like vinyl as some fans look for a more authentic music . experience.' Cameron . Farrelly, a music specialist at the advertising agency pd3, said: 'Over . the past 10 years iTunes has drastically changed the way we share, . purchase and consume music.' Apple iTunes officially launched on 28 April 2003. This screen grab is how the original software looked ten years ago. In the ten years since it launched, iTunes has been through various changes. This is the current version, iTunes 11, which launched in November 2012. The first generation iPod was launched in October 2001. It came in 5GB and 10GB models and had a mechanical scroll wheel. 'It has given us unrestricted and portable access to music's extensive back catalogue and taught the masses the art of a perfect playlist. iTunes have pioneered a listening revolution.' Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services, said the company took 'great pride' in exposing music fans to new and emerging artists. He said: 'When Apple introduced the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003, we thought if consumers had a great, legal way to download music they would embrace it - did they ever. 'Apple was floored, as were the labels, when customers bought over one million songs during the first week. 'And now, 10 years later, we continue to be amazed by how much customers love the iTunes Store with more than 25 billion songs sold.' The iTunes store is now available in 119 countries around the world. Besides its vast collection of music tracks, it holds more than 190,000 episodes of television programmes and more than 45,000 films. Geoff Taylor, CEO of the UK's music industry body BPI, said: 'iTunes was the application that persuaded music fans to pay for music in the digital environment. 'Its simplicity and its integration with the iPod, and the ease with which you can manage your music library was critical in giving consumers confidence in digital music. 2003 . 1.

'I think we can credit iTunes with the resurgence of the singles market, which was in the doldrums in the early 2000s but has now hit a record high. 'Apple deserves a lot of credit for bringing vitality into the digital music market.' Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience album is the fastest-selling album of all time. It sold 580,000 copies worldwide when it was released in March 2013. Data from the first Digital Music Index (DMI), published last September by Musicmetric, the London and LA-based trend analysis firm, showed that where retailers like iTunes and legal music streaming services like Spotify were available, piracy was reduced. Gregory Mead, CEO of Semetric, which owns Musicmetric, said: 'There’s no doubt that iTunes changed the game not just for music, but for retailing films, books and apps. It caught the crest of a wave just as the music industry sought a solution to file-sharing. Our data shows that piracy is still a major problem with billions of songs shared each year. But the good news is that retailers like iTunes and 7Digital along with streaming services like Spotify and Deezer can help reduce piracy. Streaming is becoming increasing popular but we don’t see it eating into sales. 'What it does do is prove that demand for music continues to grow and having more ways to market your product can only be a positive thing.","It would take 140,000 years to listen to all the 35m songs in the iTunes library .

"Out late shoveling snow one night, former Nova Scotia lawmaker Charlie Parker spotted a dark object that seemed out of place in the storm. The strange mass struggling through the snow appeared to Parker to be a seal, but when he approached it, he found a 73-year-old man in mittens and a hat with ear flaps in need of assistance. 'On behalf of all seals, I'd like to thank him for his interest,' Gerald Whitman told the BBC. 'If he hadn't been as strong as he was, I think we still would be there.' Scroll down for video . Local hero: Former Nova Scotia lawmaker Charlie Parker thought he saw a seal struggling through a snow storm, which turned out to be Gerald Whitman attempting to escape a disabled car . 'I made a wrong turn somewhere' driving to the hospital for dialysis, Whitman said, and ended up becoming trapped in the snow. Deciding to brave the elements rather than wait in the disabled car, he squirmed out of the passenger door and started walking towards a home in the distance. The snow was deep. Whitman's arthritic knees began to feel the toll of the weather and forced him to sit down to rest. When he tried to stand again, his knees wouldn't let him, so he decided to crawl towards help, contemplating 'what would happen if he fell asleep.' After an hour straining against the snow, Whitman felt he couldn't go any farther. 'I made peace with the Lord and said ""If it be your will, so be it."" And I just stopped,' Whitman said. 'Apparently it wasn't his will.' Not a seal: Whitman was on his way to the hospital when his car got stuck and went out in search of help in mittens and a cap with flaps . Rescue: Parker was shoveling the driveway to make way for his son, who was returning from a night shift in the storm . It was just at that moment Whitman says Parker appeared, on an aborted seal rescue mission, and helped him to safety. Parker, who was out shoveling for his son returning from a night shift, took Whitman into his home, spooning coffee into his mouth because his hands couldn't hold a mug, according to the CBC. A plow was dispatched to clear a path for an ambulance, which took 45 minutes to make it through the storm to pick up Whitman, who was shaking uncontrollably. 'I'm sure I didn't do anything different than anyone else would have,' Parker said.","Gerald Whitman, 73, was on his way to dialysis treatment when his car got stuck in the snow .

"A three-time U.S. Olympian who was publicity exposed on Thursday as an elite $600-an-hour escort has revealed that her husband knew about her double life and tried to put an end to it. Suzy . Favor-Hamilton, a 44-year-old married mother of three, has been working . with one of Las Vegas' top agencies to book 'dates' across cities . including Las Vegas, Chicago and Houston. Despite . using the name 'Kelly Lundy' as she advertised her services through . Haley Heston's Private Collection, her double life has been revealed . after she told clients about her real identity, believing there was an . unwritten rule they would not speak out. Scroll down for video . Double-life: Suzy Favor-Hamilton, a three-time U.S. Olympian, has reportedly been working as an escort at cities throughout the country for a year. Right, she runs in the 1,500 meters at the 2000 Sydney Olympics . Showing her assets: On her escort profile, Favor-Hamilton explained that discretion was extremely important to her and would blur her fave as a result, but that didn't stop her from showing off her body . Expensive taste: She wrote on her profile that she likes Herve Leger dresses, Christian Louboutin shoes, and Agent Provocateur shoes . But now at least one of these clients has contacted The Smoking Gun, which in turn has revealed the details of Favor-Hamilton's clandestine career, which she now calls a 'huge mistake.' Soon after the story appeared online, . instantly sparking a furor in the media, Favor-Hamilton took to Twitter . to offer her 3,183 followers her side of the story. In one missive, the 44-year-old . mother explained that she was initially drawn to escorting . ‘because it provided many coping mechanisms for me when I was going . through a very challenging time with my marriage and my life. ‘It provided an escape from a life that I was struggling in. It was a double life,’ she wrote. Going public: Favor-Hamilton took to Twitter, writing a series of posts in which she revealed that her husband knew about her double life, and that her decision to become an escort was fueled by depression . In another, Favor-Hamilton wrote that . the reasons behind her decision to turn to a life of prostitution, while . seemingly irrational now, ‘made sense at the time’ and were closely . related to depression. ‘As crazy as I know it seems, I never . thought I would be exposed, therefore never hurting anybody,’ she said . in one Twitter post. The Olympian has refused to be . labelled a victim, insisting that she knew what she was doing and taking . full responsibility for her actions. She told The Smoking Gun that her . husband was the only one who knew about her moonlighting as a prostitute . in cities across the country. Profile: She reportedly worked under the name 'Kylie' and uploaded provocative pictures (as seen) to her profile on an escort agency website. The profile claims she is bisexual and charges $600 an hour . ‘He tried, he tried to get me to stop. He wasn't supportive of this at all,’ Favor Hamilton noted. The 44-year-old has revealed that she is currently seeking psychological help for her problem. ‘I fully intend to make amends and get . back to being a good mother, wife, daughter, and friend,’ she concluded . in her most recent post. Favor-Hamilton entered the public eye competing as a middle distance runner in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Olympics. She went on to record a Nike TV advert, a swimsuit calendar and carry out Disney promo work. She now works as a motivational speaker and runs a successful realty company in Madison, Wisconsin with her husband Mark, whom she met at college. They have a seven-year-old daughter. But last December, she began working . with Haley Heston's agency to escape this routine life, she told the . Smoking Gun when it caught up with her. It is not clear how she was . introduced to the agency, but she wrote on the website: 'I met Haley . with the idea of fulfilling a fantasy and only doing it for the short . term. Betrayal: Favor-Hamilton is married to her college sweetheart, Mark, who tried to make her stop the escort work, she said. They also have a seven-year-old daughter together, right . 'Well, after my first date, I was . hooked, and have been doing my best to visit Las Vegas as often as my . schedule allows (I run my own business in my real world life).' She featured in numerous provocative . photographs on her online profile on the website - yet always had her . face obscured or hidden from the camera. She explained: 'Discretion . is EXTREMELY important to me, hence you will only see blurred photos of . my face on this site. I know this is not ideal, but I hope you . understand that it is essential for me.' Favor . Hamilton also described herself on the profile - which has now been . removed - as a 'workout fanatic' who enjoyed skiing, biking, hiking, . running marathons and traveling. She wrote that she was bisexual so happy to carry out services with couples. 'Working with couples requires special . skill and I pride myself in my ability to make a woman feel comfortable . and not threatened in any way,' she wrote. 'A date with me will NEVER . feel rushed.' She listed her rates as $600 for an hour, $1,000 for two hours, $4,000 for 12 hours and $6,000 for 24 hours, according to the page seen by the Smoking Gun. And clients are happy with her services, allowing her to be named as The Erotic Review's third-ranked 'provider' in Las Vegas earlier this month. In one July 2012 review, a client . wrote: 'She is worth every penny. I will go bankrupt before I stop . seeing her. I hope no one else goes to see her, because I want her all . to myself.' Prostitution is illegal in all of the . cities where Favor-Hamilton has had 'dates' arranged by Haley Heston. But she said that she had never considered the legal ramifications of her . work. Tumble: At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, she famously fell during the 1500m final, losing out on a medal . Loss: She said she became frustrated during the race that she could not win a medal in her brother's memory. Her brother Dan, pictured, committed suicide the year before the 2000 Olympics . As well as legal problems, she may also . face a backlash from her other employers if they learn that she . apparently fitted the 'dates' around her demanding work schedule. Comfortable life: She now works at a realty firm with her husband, Mark . At the end of August, Haley Heston said 'Kelly' would . be able to work in Orange County California. On . September 1, she appeared at the Disney Exhibit Hall to speak to runners . ahead of the Disneyland Half Marathon the next day, which she ran with her husband. And in another example, the service . said she would be in Vegas between November 29 and December 5. She ran . the December 2 Rock n' Roll Marathon along the Strip. After being tracked down to a hotel in Las Vegas, Favor Hamilton eventually admitted she was 'Kelly', and while she called the role 'exciting' she acknowledged she had made an error in judgment. 'I take full responsibility for my . mistakes,' she said, the Smoking Gun reported. 'I'm not the victim and I'm not going that route. I'm owning up to what I did. I would not blame anybody . except myself.' She added: 'Everybody in this world makes mistakes. I . made a huge mistake. Huge.' On Thursday, she tweeted: 'I do not expect people to understand, but the reasons for doing this made sense to me at the time and were very much related to depression. 'I cannot emphasize enough how sorry I am to anyone I have hurt as a result of my actions and greatly appreciate the support from family and those closest to me. I fully intend to make amends and get back to being a good mother, wife, daughter, and friend.' Public eye: Favor Hamilton, pictured at a Stiletto Dash at The Palazzo in Las Vegas last December, said she only planned to work with the agency short term but 'got hooked' after her first date . Brazen: Favor-Hamilton (second left at the event) said she started working as an escort to escape her routine . She said that she had not second . guessed telling clients about her real identity and called herself 'too . trusting'. She said she expected all clients to honor a silence code.

"Olympic chairman Sebastian Coe denies that he helped Greek Olympic Committee president Spyros Capralos obtain extra top-priced tickets . Senior Olympics officials and agents were accused yesterday of selling thousands of premium tickets for the Games on the black market. Representatives of countries including Saudi Arabia, China, Serbia, Lithuania, and Greece have been caught trying to trade the coveted tickets at inflated prices. They had been allocated by the Games’ organisers and were meant to be sold at face value to the public in their own countries. But officials held back premium seats intended for their public – including the 100m men’s finals and the opening ceremony - so they could sell them for up to 10 times the market price abroad. Yesterday the International Olympic Committee launched an investigation into how so many of the national Olympic committees became involved in corrupt ticket practices. The Mail has also learned that two members of the IOC itself are being investigated over the matter. A source at the IOC said they were ‘seriously concerned’ about the allegations and would now consider a complete overhaul of the system, which allowed 204 participating nations to assign their own ticketing agents, almost unchecked. An estimated 1.2million of the original 8.8million London 2012 tickets were given to foreign committees. Spyros Capralos who is named in the allegations, hands over the Olympic Flame to Princess Anne last month . The NOCs are banned from selling tickets to customers from outside their country or to anyone planning to resell them. In addition, they must not sell them for more than 20 per cent above face value. Undercover reporters from the Sunday . Times discovered 15 corrupt ticket agents – responsible for 54 countries . – willing to sell thousands of sought-after tickets at huge mark-ups. Yesterday Sir Menzies Campbell, the . former Liberal Democrat leader who is on the Olympic Board told the BBC . the ticket selling was a ‘thorough disgrace’. Final countdown: Finishing touches are being applied to the venues in Stratford . Scandal: A number of country's officials have been accused of irregularities . ‘The sanctions [for offending . countries] should be not just that the tickets get  cancelled for this . Olympic Games but that tickets are not awarded on future occasions,’ he . said. A source at the IOC admitted its system appeared to have ‘failed’ and would have to be reviewed before the next Games. The revelations will enrage thousands of Olympics fans in the UK who have struggled to buy any tickets. Britain’s Olympics organiser Locog . has been heavily criticised for the handling of its ticket sales, after . its website and flawed ballot system left many Britons empty-handed. However, some foreign Olympics committees had been given far more tickets than they could feasibly sell. In April, it emerged that tickets for . sought-after events such as beach volleyball and basketball were still . available over-the-counter in Spanish shops – but no one wanted them – . while people here scrabbled for tickets to see even the little-known . sports. The IOC held an emergency meeting of . its executive board on Friday and has asked its ethics commission to . investigate the claims as a matter of urgency. In one case, Sunday Times staff, . posing as envoys of a Middle Eastern ticket tout, were offered 1,500 . tickets by Serbia’s ticket agency, Big Blue Tourism for £80,000 in cash. In another, a Lithuanian seller, Baltic Clipper, admitted tickets had been withheld from their own people ‘on purpose’.","Spyros Capralos, a top Greek official, said he had pulled strings with Sebastian Coe to obtain more top-priced tickets .

"Carlton Cole insists a shouting match with Sam Allardyce has eased the tension over his failed move from West Ham to West Brom. Calamity struck on deadline day when, at 10.55pm, Allardyce was forced to call the striker at West Brom's training ground to tell him his move was off because a bid to sign Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor as a replacement had collapsed. Having missed out on a two-and-a-half-year £5million contract at West Brom, Cole has confirmed he tore into his manager on the phone, but subsequent talks have cooled the situation. Carlton Cole was livid when a deadline day move to West Brom fell through at 10.55pm . By a quirk of timing, Cole is likely to face West Brom in the FA Cup fifth round, having made his first start since November 22 in the 0-0 draw at Southampton on Wednesday. The 31-year-old, whose West Ham deal expires in four months, said: 'Mark Noble and Kevin Nolan said to me it would be something else if I could score the winner at West Brom for West Ham given what went on in the transfer window. 'I was upset at the time because I wasn't playing here as much as I wanted to. 'So when a team shows interest in you and offers you game time and it doesn't come off you might react this way. West Ham striker Cole had words with manager Sam Allardyce but has now moved on . 'The manager has talked to me since that and we have moved on from there. It wasn't personal and these things happen in football. 'I just have to get on with it and be professional and wait for my chance to come to start and it did against Southampton.' Cole added: 'I was over there and the deal didn't go through. 'The gaffer kept faith in me obviously by starting me against Southampton when I didn't expect it. I want to try to put a solid performance in. 'He knows what he gets from me and that's probably what Tony Pulis saw as well.' West Ham striker Andy Carroll hobbles away from Southampton on Wednesday night . Cole's prospects of starting at the Hawthorns have been increased by the latest injury to Andy Carroll. The striker had a scan on his left knee on Thursday after being hurt in the draw at Southampton. Having injured the same knee against Liverpool at the end of January. Allardyce fears Carroll will be out for more than two weeks, but will not find out categorically until he receives the scan results on Friday. Noble and Nolan are expected to be fit for the West Brom clash after missing out in midweek through illness and a foot injury respectively.","Carlton Cole was lined up for move from West Ham to West Brom .

"A doctor infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone who arrived in the United States on Saturday critically ill from the deadly virus is believed to be the worst-affected  patient  to ever be treated in the country. The University of Nebraska Medical Center said that Dr. Martin Salia, a legal US resident who lives in Maryland, had 'safely arrived' in Omaha after a flight from Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. He was taken by ambulance to the center's biocontainment unit, where he will be kept in isolation to avoid infecting others. Dr. Salia is a general surgeon who had been working at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown. Patients, including mothers who hours earlier had given birth, fled the 60-bed Nebraska hospital after news of the Ebola case emerged, United Methodist News reported. Scroll down for video . Touch down: Health workers in protective suits transport Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon working in West Africa who had been diagnosed with Ebola, from a jet that brought him from Sierra Leone to a waiting ambulance that will take him to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday . 'Sicker than an other patient': Dr. Salia, 44, who lives in Maryland and is believed to have several children, is critically ill after contracting Ebola . Arrival: Dr. Salia left landed in Nebraska from Freetown, Sierra Leone, on Saturday amid high security . Transport: The driver of the ambulance carrying Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon working in Sierra Leone who had been diagnosed with Ebola, gives a thumbs-up sign as he heads  to the Nebraska Medical Center . Treatment: Dr. Martin Salia is placed on a stretcher upon his arrival at the Nebraska Medical Center Biocontainment Unit in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday November 15, 2014 . Dr. Salia is the third Ebola patient to be treated by the UNMC, one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients. Both of the previous patients survived. He had traveled back to his home country to treat Ebola patients at Freetown's Connaught Hospital amid a devastating outbreak when he became infected. He came down with symptoms of the virus on November 6 but test results were negative. Dr. Salia then tested positive on Monday. Five other doctors in Sierra Leone have contracted Ebola — and all have died. His evacuation was facilitated by the US government at the request of his wife, an American citizen who agreed to reimburse all expenses, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. 'Just as we have done in previous cases, every precaution is being taken to ensure the evacuation is completed safely and securely, that critical care is provided en route, and that strict isolation is maintained,' Psaki said. Doctors have said they were told that Salia is 'critically ill'. They said his exact condition would be evaluated when he arrives, but that he is 'possibly sicker than the first patients successfully treated in the United States'. Wife: Isatu Salia, seen here with her husband, described him as 'caring' and 'hardworking'. She will now travel to Nebraska to be with him . Scene: The UNMC in Omaha is one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients . 'We immediately started preparing the unit and notifying staff members of this possibility,' biocontainment unit medical director Phil Smith said in a statement. 'We've obviously been through this a couple of times before so we know what to expect.' Dr. Salia is believed to be the father of at least two sons. CNN reported that he has several children. There are currently no cases of Ebola in the United States, where nine people have been treated for the killer virus. Dr. Salia is the tenth. Only one - Liberian-born Thomas Eric Duncan - has died from the disease on US soil. The cases are part of the deadliest Ebola outbreak ever, which has killed more than 5,100 people in West Africa and infected nearly 15,000 in total, mostly in hardest hit Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Epidemic: . Health workers prepare to carry the body of an Ebola virus victim in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, as the country tried to combat the Ebola virus disease outbreak . Ebola outbreak in West Africa . Health workers from the Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society Burial Team 7 place a body in a grave at King Tom cemetary in Freetown on November 12, 2014. Dr. Martin Salia arrived in the U.S. from Freetown on Saturday . Despite some hopeful signs - Liberia has lifted its state of emergency and the DR Congo announced the end of its own, unrelated, outbreak of Ebola - the recent deaths of three people in Mali have fueled fears of a new African hotspot. There is no known cure for Ebola, one of the deadliest known pathogens, but trials for several possible treatments were announced this week in West Africa and Canada. The disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids. Salia received his surgical training from a group called the Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons, which seeks to train African doctors on a level comparable to training they would receive in the U.S., said Richard Toupin, of Auburn, Indiana, a fellow medical missionary. 'He is one of the best-trained surgeons in his country,' Toupin said. 'He is a very competent surgeon.' Dr Salia (pictured, second right, with his wife and sons) was born in Sierre Leone, but is a permanent resident of the U.S. who lives in Maryland with his family . Sons: The medic, who has at least two sons, including Hinwaii (left) and Maada (right), came down with symptoms of Ebola on November 6. Tests results on Monday were positive, according to the official . Bruce Steffes, executive director of PAACS, said Salia graduated from the surgical training program in 2008. The training includes a requirement to practice in Africa for four years after completion. As a result, Steffes said, Salia was free to practice anywhere he wanted, but elected to stay in Sierra Leone, where the need for surgeons is immense. 'People like Martin are just absolutely dedicated, highly trained ... and doing their best in absolutely horrifying conditions,' Steffes said. Jeff Bleijerveld, director of global ministries for the United Brethren in Christ church, said he last talked to Salia in February 2013, when they met to discuss planning for a hospital in the southern part of Sierra Leone. He recalled watching Salia perform a hernia surgery on a young boy, assisted by a handyman who was not actually a doctor. He recalled Salia leading the surgical team in prayer before the operation. The United Brethren played an early role in Salia's medical training. 'He's a quiet leader,' Bleijerveld said. 'Our people still have a real affection for him.'","Dr. Martin Salia, 44,  is undergoing treatment at the the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha .

"HIV self-testing kits could soon be for sale in the UK. A change in UK law means that from Sunday it will be legal to sell the home testing kits. However, it is unlikely that any will be seen on the shelves until late this year or early next year. From Sunday it will be legal to sell HIV self-testing kits in the UK. Image shows the HIV virus in human tissue . This is because none have currently been approved for sale in the UK or the EU. Currently, people can take HIV tests at home but they have to send a saliva, or blood, sample to a lab which will give them their results after the sample has been analysed. The change in the law means people will be able to buy tests that give them an immediate result that they can read themselves. The tests work by analysing saliva samples that people take with a swab and are easily read from the test kits by people with no medical knowledge or training. The law was changed in an attempt to ensure more people who are HIV positive are diagnosed and that they are diagnosed early. This is important because about 25 per cent of HIV positive people in the UK do not know they are HIV positive and these are the people most likely to pass on the infection. It is also important to ensure people are diagnosed as early as possible to make treatment as effective as it can be. Michael Brady, Medical Director at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘We welcome this change in the law, which will give people another choice about how and where they test for HIV. Currently, if people want to be tested for HIV they have to go to a doctor or a nurse. Alternatively they can take a blood or saliva sample at home and send it to a lab for analysis . ‘The success of our HIV postal testing scheme has shown that many people who have never tested before, or who have been putting off a visit to the clinic, are willing to test at home. ‘With HIV transmission in the UK largely driven by the 22,000 people who remain undiagnosed, anything that provides them with another option to test and access effective treatment is welcome. ‘It is vital that HIV self-testing kits offer high quality information, including how to obtain practical and emotional support and how to quickly access specialist HIV services. ‘We will be working closely with manufacturers to ensure that any kit that comes to market meets the very best standards of patient information.’","From Sunday it will be legal to sell HIV self-testing kits in the UK .

"For any student, the pressure of university finals is bad enough - but for Louise Sinnott, 22, the stress was exacerbated by having to rush to the loo up to 20 times a day as she suffered a flare-up of her Crohn's disease. 'I couldn't do anything or plan anything because I needed to be close to a loo all the time. Which, as well as being hugely inconvenient and unpleasant, is also horribly embarrassing,' she recalls.'I left my student flat and went home to my mum's house to lock myself away until the attack had died down.' Crohn's is an autoimmune condition affecting the bowel that is caused when the immune system triggers the release of a protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, which kills the 'good bacteria' in the gut. Scroll down for video . Worrying: There has been a 300 per cent rise in the number of 16 to 29-year-olds receiving treatment in England for Crohn's in the past ten years. Sufferer Bethany Townsend (pictured) recently highlighted the issue by proudly posing with her colostomy bag . Mrs Townsend still suffers with Crohn's disease and hopes for a cure. Since getting the colostomy bags (pictured) she has had a stem cell transplant but caught MRSA, which almost killed her . Support: Rochelle Haisley, pictured, said she has had an 'ileostomy bag for years now' This leads . to inflammation and, in turn, diarrhoea, stomach pain, weight loss - . because of poor digestion of food - and extreme tiredness. Around 115,000 people in the UK have Crohn's, with most diagnosed between their mid-teens and late 20s. But . new figures suggest that its incidence is rising dramatically - there . has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of 16 to 29-year-olds . receiving treatment in England for Crohn's in the past ten years, . according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Crohn's . is a chronic, often debilitating condition and many patients end up . needing surgery to remove part of their bowel. Last week, the Mail . reported on Crohn's sufferer Bethany Townsend, who became an internet . sensation by posting a photograph of herself in a bikini, exposing the . colostomy bags she has to wear because of the condition. Bethany, 23, . a make-up artist who was diagnosed when she was three, said she posted . the picture to help others in her position feel more comfortable in . their own skin. So why are more and more young people like Bethany and Louise succumbing to Crohn's disease? In the sun: Katie Ashton shared this selfie in a message of support for a fellow sufferer . The . condition has a strong genetic link - 'a person with a first-degree . relative, such as a parent, with Crohn's has a one in ten chance of . developing it,' says Alastair Forbes, professor of medicine at Norwich . Medical School. It may be that a genetic predisposition is . exacerbated by poor diet, suggests Dr Sally Mitton, a consultant . gastroenterologist at St George's Hospital in South-West London. 'If you . have a lot of junk food it makes it more likely that you will develop . Crohn's.' Crohn's is a chronic, often debilitating condition and many patients end up needing surgery. File picture . Certain foods could make the gut 'go into overdrive', . causing inflammation as it tries to process them, says Janindra . Warusavitarne, a consultant colorectal surgeon at St Mark's Hospital, . Harrow. 'It could be that certain foods cause a change in the types of . bugs living in the gut - we're only speculating, but this may well be . processed foods.' Ironically, many Crohn's sufferers prefer sweet, . processed foods because these are less likely to cause diarrhoea than . high-fibre foods such as bran cereals. But diet alone can't be to . blame, as many patients who develop Crohn's eat healthily. Another . potential trigger is smoking, which can double the risk by reducing . blood supply to the gut. One theory is that it is linked to the . over-prescription of antibiotics, particularly in childhood and the . teenage years, which may kill off 'good' gut bacteria. Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system. Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury or irritation and can cause redness, swelling and pain. Crohn's . disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease . (IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis. Crohn's . is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition. Sufferers . will have periods of good health, remission, as well as times when . their symptoms flare up or relapse. There is currently no cure for the disease, but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms. The . cause of Crohn's disease is not well understood. Experts believe the . condition is, in part, inherited, while an abnormal reaction of the . immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to . contribute. Viruses, bacteria, diet, smoking and stress have . all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definitive . evidence that any one of these is a cause of Crohn's. Crohn's . causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the . body's ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a . healthy way. Symptoms include: . Abdominal pain and diarrhoea . Tiredness and fatigue . Feeling generally unwell . Mouth ulcers . Loss of appetite and weight loss . Anaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells . It's estimated around 250,000 people suffer from the condition in the . UK. It can start in any age, but usually appears for the first time . between the ages of 10 and 40. The disease can cause complications . including perforations. They happen when a severe blockage ruptures the . bowel, making a hole. The contents of the bowel can leak through and . form an abscess. It causes pain and a fever.Source: Crohn's and Colitis UK . Whatever the . cause, there is no cure. Treatments such as steroids can reduce . inflammation and immunosuppressant drugs help to control flare-ups. Avoiding stress and taking exercise can help, too, but about 60 per cent . of patients eventually need surgery. The condition can improve with . age - so if symptoms are controlled and you get an early diagnosis you . may avoid the need for surgery, says Professor Forbes. 'Unfortunately . that doesn't always happen, as often the disease is confused with . irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),' says Mr Warusavitarne. 'In the early . stages Crohn's symptoms can be quite subtle.' In cases such as . Bethany Townsend's, when a lot of damaged intestine has been removed, a . colostomy bag may well be the only option. The surgery is designed . to temporarily divert waste away from the inflamed colon into a bag to . allow the colon to heal - the end of the small intestine is disconnected . from the colon and rerouted through a hole, known as a stoma, in the . abdomen. An external bag is attached to the opening to collect the . waste. Once inflammation in the colon has settled down, a second . operation is performed to close the stoma and reattach the small . intestine to the colon. In Bethany Townsend's case, the bags have not worked and doctors are considering other options, even a bowel transplant. 'But . I'm still really hopeful and after everything I've been through I know . I'm a strong person,' Bethany says. 'I'm looking forward to chasing my . goals.' The mystery for Louise Sinnott is why she developed Crohn's . in the first place, as she ate healthily and there is no family history . of the condition. She wonders if a stomach bug she caught on holiday in . Madeira in 2011, when she was 19, may have triggered it. Mr . Warusavitarne says the disease can be triggered in this way. 'When gut . bacteria are exposed to a stomach bug or perhaps a new type of food, . they can be radically altered in people with a genetic predisposition to . Crohn's, with an increase in harmful bacteria and fewer beneficial . bacteria.' Louise's GP initially diagnosed IBS. Like Crohn's this . causes stomach cramps, bloating and diarrhoea, though only Crohn's . causes weight loss and persistent diarrhoea. Crohn's sufferers may also . have a 'lump' in their abdomen. But over the next few months Louise's . symptoms worsened and she was sent back to hospital in February 2013 . for a colonoscopy, where the lining of the bowel is examined using a . tiny camera. This confirmed she had Crohn's. 'It was such a relief to know what it was,' says Louise, who is about  to start work as an environmental business adviser. After . three months on steroids she was put on a daily anti-inflammatory drug, . Pentasa. She is likely to have to take this for life. Louise is now . careful about what she eats, limits her alcohol intake  and has begun . exercising. 'I've got no choice but to live with Crohn's,' she says.

"A man who was one of Britain's fattest teenagers lost 17st by working out - but now says the NHS won't remove his excess skin because his muscles mean he's still 'too heavy'. Jacob Horner, 20, weighed an astonishing 28st when he was 16 and he was so fat his ribs began to ache. At his peak, Mr Horner was a massive 5st bigger than Nathan Hewitt - who weighed 23st at 15 and was hailed another of the UK's fattest teenagers. Jacob Horner (pictured when he was 17 and weighed 28st) piled on the pounds on a diet of takeaways and junk food to become one of Britain's fattest teenagers . Mr Horner than started dieting and exercising and lost 17st meaning he weighed a healthy 11st . Determined to turn his life around, Mr Horner began going to the gym and shed an incredible 17st. He dropped to 11st and then put another 2st on by doing weight training and becoming very muscular. But Mr Horner claims he has now been denied surgery to remove his excess skin three times because his muscular frame is so heavy he is classified as overweight. Mr Horner said: ‘Because of my fitness regime I still have a BMI over 25 - the limit for what's considered “healthy” - because of muscle weight. ‘I'm being penalised now because I'm too fit, so I've had to start shedding muscle weight now to get the operation. ‘It's wreaked havoc on my confidence, I should be enjoying my weight loss but instead I feel paranoid about the excess skin I still have.’ As a result of his weight loss, Mr Horner has been left with folds of unsightly excess skin on his stomach . The Doncaster Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it does not have any clinical data about Mr Horner to be able to make a decision on his individual case . However, Mr Horner says the NHS will not pay for him to have surgery to remove his excess skin because he is so muscular that his BMI still classifies him as overweight . Mr Horner, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, ballooned after a diet of takeaways and five years sitting in his room playing on the Xbox. But after realising it was time to change, he went on a diet and started going to the gym. Mr Horner, who lives at home with his mother Sharon and is currently looking for work, has lost so much weight that he now carries folds of excess skin which he is desperate to get removed. His waist size has shrunk from 58ins to 30ins and he has gone from needing a 4XL T-shirt to a medium, but said the whole situation is making him feel down. He said: ‘I was overweight from a baby. It got the point where my ribs and bones were beginning to ache and I just thought enough was enough. ‘I tried the Cambridge Diet [a low calorie diet made up of branded shakes, bars, soups and porridge] for a couple of years but it started to make me ill. Since then I've eaten nothing but brown rice, porridge and chicken for two years. Mr Horner says the excess skin is making him depressed and that it is preventing him enjoying his weight loss . Mr Horner is now trying to lose some of his muscle so that he weighs less and can have the surgery . ‘Before that, I was eating typical junk food, lots of crisps and Indian takeaways. My bones were hurting and it ached just to bend down to tie my laces. ‘It took a lot of willpower, but I became driven from day one after seeing results overnight. Also, I just really wanted to prove others wrong and do something beneficial for myself. It's good to have goals. ‘I started going to the gym to lose weight and just loved it. Now I go five times a week and put everything else second. ‘Although, I have had to stop going so much to lose muscle weight to get this operation.’ His mother Sharon said: ‘He has worked so hard at the gym and is so disappointed. He's only 20 so hasn’t had a life yet. ‘He wanted to lose weight for his own health. ‘He’s so depressed because he has worked . so hard, he hardly dare go out. It’s painful and his clothes pinch. I . think the whole thing is really unfair.’ Mr Horner (pictured before his weight loss) has shrunk from a 58ins to 30ins waist and he has gone from needing a 4XL T-shirt to wearing a medium . Mr Horner added: ‘I've been staying in a lot since losing my weight. The skin has affected my confidence and made it hard for me to get a job. ‘There was even an occasion on a rare night out where a girl saw my excess skin and laughed and ran away. It's really hurtful.’ The Doncaster Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it does not have any clinical data about Mr Horner to be able to make a decision on his individual case. A spokesman added: ‘We can commission surgery but it will depend on the individual's circumstances. ‘We would advise that he goes to see his GP as there is funding available to pay for surgery following extreme weight loss but there are criteria to meet. ‘He needs to discuss his situation and that would be the best starting point.’ A spokesperson explained that the Clinical Commissioning Group does not usually pay for this type of surgery but that it can be considered in exceptional circumstances. He said that the extremity of Mr Horner's weight loss means that he could, potentially, qualify but that he would have to maintain a steady weight for two years before he would be considered for surgery.","Jacob Horner, now 20, ballooned to a huge 28st by the age of just 16 .

"When the police come knocking at a suspected drug den, you wouldn't necessarily expect them to leave a polite calling card. But that is exactly what happened when officers left a light-hearted note informing the occupant of a property they had raided that they had 'no cannabis left' after 72 plants were discovered. Officers from Greater Manchester Police kicked down the door of the house in Worsley, Salford, during the raid, but found nobody was in the property. They then altered a printed note saying 'unfortunately you were not at home', to leave the polite message. Police officers left this light-hearted note at a house following a drugs raid in which 72 cannabis plants were discovered . A photo of the note was then posted on the GMP Salford West Twitter feed along with the message: 'We’ve kicked in a door in Worsley, got 72 cannabis plants, nobody home. Left a note. GMP, keeping you in the loop.' The tweet proved popular among Twitter users who had by this morning re-tweeted it 759 times. The force, including GMP Salford West, has an active social media presence, but it has not always been as well-received as yesterday's post. Last month, an officer behind the feed got into hot water by advising people being ‘harassed’ on Facebook to close their accounts. Officers found more than 72 cannabis plants during the raid at the house in Worsley, Salford (file picture) It caused a storm among some tweeters, who said it appeared to blame victims for bullying and harassment. The tweet was later deleted and an apology - which said that ‘bullying and harassment is, of course, serious’ - was posted.

"It is a far cry from the bulky, balloon-like spacesuits worn by today's astronauts. In the future, we may simply don a suit that automatically shrinks itself to become a 'second skin' to protect us from space. The skintight, pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut, but would give her much more freedom to move during planetary exploration. Scroll down for video . The spacesuit of the future? The MIT 'second skin' suit is made from a smart material that contracts to hug the skin, yet creates a safe, pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut, but would give her much more freedom to move during planetary exploration. For future astronauts, the process of suiting up is set to be much simpler. Instead of climbing into a conventional, bulky, gas-pressurized suit, an astronaut may don a lightweight, stretchy garment, lined with tiny, muscle-like coils (below). They would then plug in to a spacecraft's power supply, triggering the coils to contract and essentially shrink-wrap the garment around the body. The skintight, pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut, but would give much more freedom to move during planetary exploration. For future astronauts, the process of suiting up may go something like this: Instead of climbing into a conventional, bulky, gas-pressurized suit, an astronaut may don a lightweight, stretchy garment, lined with tiny, musclelike coils. They would then plug in to a spacecraft's power supply, triggering the coils to contract and essentially shrink-wrap the garment around her body. The skintight, pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut, but would give her much more freedom to move during planetary exploration. To take the suit off, astronauts would only have to apply modest force, returning the suit to its looser form. Now MIT researchers are one step closer to engineering such an active, 'second-skin' spacesuit. Dava Newman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering systems at MIT, and her colleagues have engineered active compression garments that incorporate small, springlike coils that contract in response to heat. The coils are made from a shape-memory alloy (SMA) — a type of material that 'remembers' an engineered shape and, when bent or deformed, can spring back to this shape when heated. The smart suit in action: An original active tourniquet design, combining shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators with 3-D printed structures (the cream-colored plastic) and passive fabric (the white strip). The team incorporated the coils in a tourniquet-like cuff, and applied a current to generate heat. At a certain trigger temperature, the coils contract to their 'remembered' form, such as a fully coiled spring, tightening the cuff in the process. In subsequent tests, the group found that the pressure produced by the coils equaled that required to fully support an astronaut in space. 'With conventional spacesuits, you're essentially in a balloon of gas that's providing you with the necessary one-third of an atmosphere [of pressure,] to keep you alive in the vacuum of space,' says Newman, who has worked for the past decade to design a form-fitting, flexible spacesuit of the future. 'We want to achieve that same pressurization, but through mechanical counterpressure — applying the pressure directly to the skin, thus avoiding the gas pressure altogether. 'We combine passive elastics with active materials. … Ultimately, the big advantage is mobility, and a very lightweight suit for planetary exploration.' The shape changing material: Two shape memory alloy (SMA) coil actuators, shown in their stretched and contracted states. Current spacesuits are extremely bulky and difficult to put on and move in . The coil design was conceived by Bradley Holschuh, a postdoc in Newman's lab. The researchers rigged an array of coils to an elastic cuff, attaching each coil to a small thread linked to the cuff. They then attached leads to the coils' opposite ends and applied a voltage, generating heat. Between 60 and 160 C, the coils contracted, pulling the attached threads, and tightening the cuff. 'These are basically self-closing buckles,' Holschuh says. 'Once you put the suit on, you can run a current through all these little features, and the suit will shrink-wrap you, and pull closed.' The group's designs and active materials may be used for other purposes, such as in athletic wear or military uniforms. 'You could use this as a tourniquet system if someone is bleeding out on the battlefield,' Holschuh says. 'If your suit happens to have sensors, it could tourniquet you in the event of injury without you even having to think about it.' 'An integrated suit is exciting to think about to enhance human performance,' Newman adds. 'We're trying to keep our astronauts alive, safe, and mobile, but these designs are not just for use in space.'","MIT suit automatically shrinks itself to become a 'second skin'

"Two G4S security guards who were due to protect footballers during the Olympic Games have been arrested on suspicion of being illegal immigrants. The men, who are believed to be from Pakistan, had secured jobs with the under-fire firm to work at the City of Coventry stadium, which is due to host 12 matches. Officers swooped on the venue after their alleged bogus status is said to have been revealed in an accreditation check by G4S, which has been criticised after failing to provide enough staff for the Games. Worrying: Two G4S security guards who were due to protect footballers during the Olympic Games at the  City of Coventry stadium, pictured, have been arrested on suspicion of being illegal immigrants .

"Uncomfortable topic: Director Amy Berg attends New York premiere of her controversial documentary An Open Secret about child sex abuse in Hollywood . A controversial documentary that allegedly links X-Men director Bryan Singer to a gang of Hollywood pedophiles got its first – and possibly only – viewing in New York last night. An Open Secret contains the astonishing revelation that a major child star was sexually abused by X-Men actor Brian Peck but refused to speak out for fear of wrecking his career. Whilst there is no suggestion that Singer was involved in the abuse of the unnamed actor, Oscar-nominated director Amy Berg admitted she had yet to find any company willing to distribute the disturbing 100-minute film. Stopping short of saying that Hollywood was protecting its own, Ms Berg confessed that even small movie festivals had refused to show An Open Secret. ‘We have this one screening. Maybe we will get distribution but it is not very likely,’ she said. ‘But people will talk about it.’ The documentary – discredited after one of the major accusers filed, then dropped lawsuits against Singer and three other men -- finally aired at the Doc New York festival before 400 people in a quarter-empty Chelsea theater. Singer, 49, gets several mentions in the film. He is shown in archive footage discussing X-Men and his inspirations, yet only once does his young male accuser Mark Egan allege impropriety. Former child actor Egan filed lawsuits against Singer, TV executive Garth Ancier, Broadway producer Gary Goddard and ex Disney honcho David Neuman in California and Hawaii earlier this year alleging wide-scale sexual abuse, only to dramatically drop the action a few months later. Egan is one of the major voices in the documentary and claims Singer, who vehemently denies the allegations, was one of the big players at drug-fueled male-only parties. Scroll down for video . Emotions running high: Evan Henzi, 21, who had accused talent manager Marty Weiss of grooming him for sex abuse, wept throughout the movie . Photo-op: Amy Berg, second from right, poses with (L to R) Paula Dorn, Anne Henry, Evan Henzi and Anita Henzi at DOC NYC at the SVA Theater Friday . He alleges he and other young boys were urged to get naked in a hot tub with Singer and his middle-aged entertainment industry friends. Amy Berg refused to cut Egan, who also sued another group of Hollywood players 10 years ago alleging similar abuse, from her documentary. ‘He puts Bryan Singer at the party,’ she told MailOnline. ‘He talks about him being at the party.’ Asked about 31-year-old Egan’s rocky history filing, then dropping, lawsuits, she snapped: ‘I met him two years ago and I am not changing my film.’ Berg, 44, uncovered large-scale sex abuse in the Catholic Church for her Oscar-nominated 2006 documentary Deliver Us From Evil. The initial premise of An Open Secret was to follow the lives of five aspiring child stars whose innocence was destroyed by predatory older males in Hollywood. Now adults, they tell how a network of Hollywood agents and managers including Bob Villard, who represented Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey McGuire when they were children, abused them. Villard was later convicted of selling images of young boys on eBay. Hollywood's wall of silence: Berg (center) said she has been having trouble finding a distributor for her film . Changing the culture: Anne Henry (right) started the organization BizParentz to help families of child actors navigate the pitfalls of Hollywood . Berg’s film revolves around an early web TV company called Digital Entertainment Network and its owners Marc Collins-Rector, Chad Shackley and Brock Pierce. Major Hollywood players including Singer, David Geffen and Arianna Huffington’s gay ex-husband Michael invested $150million into the company, according to the documentary. Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce threw lavish parties where young boys were encouraged to drink and take drugs before mandatory skinny-dipping sessions in the swimming pool and hot-tub. Naming names: Actor Brian Peck (left), who had a role in Bryan Singer's (right) X-Men, is named in the documentary as one of the major abusers. The boys claimed Collins-Rector, who later fled to Spain before being jailed for child abuse, hinted he could have people ‘eliminated’ and would derail the careers of anyone who spoke out. Egan, who filed lawsuits against the DEN owners a decade ago, did not attend the New York screening but two other accusers, Evan Henzi and Joey Coleman, did. Henzi, 21, cried throughout the film and fought back tears when he told MailOnline how talent manager Marty Weiss had groomed him for abuse. Coleman, who appeared in Growing Pains, confronts one of his alleged abusers Michael Harrah, a Screen Actors Guild child rep, in the documentary. X-Men and Return of the Living Dead star Peck, a close friend of Charlie Sheen, is named in the documentary as one of the major abusers. Accuser: Michael Egan III, pictured in April after he filed lawsuits against four Hollywood figures, appears in the film and recounts the alleged abuse he witnessed at pool parties hosted by internet company bosses . Lawsuit: Egan, pictured left as a boy, accused X-Men director Bryan Singer, right, of abuse but later dropped the lawsuits after it emerged he had given inconsistent stories. Singer has always denied the abuse . Change of heart: Egan filed a lawsuit against ex Disney executive David Neuman (pictured), but later dropped it . Anne Henry, who set up BizParentz to help families navigate the pitfalls of Hollywood, claims that a major child star filed charges against 50-year-old Peck anonymously. ‘People don’t want this out,’ she said. ’Brian Peck moved to Nickelodeon. He befriended a pretty major child actor, who filed charges against him. ‘Peck pleaded guilty. The victim was anonymous so he was able to continue to work. ‘The kid who wants to speak out would have to give up their career. Named: The film also looks at accusations that Marc Collins-Rector, an internet company owner, pictured, hosted pool parties for men and young boys . ‘Peck is still working on kids shows and he has been convicted.’ Henry slammed the handful of convictions as ‘the tip of the iceberg,’ questioning how Peck could continue to work with children. Diff’rent Strokes star Todd Bridges also talks in the documentary about abuse he suffered as a child star and Corey Feldman is seen in archive footage discussing his own experiences at the hands of older Hollywood men. The documentary also flashes up a clip of Home Alone star Macauley Culkin discussing his career with David Letterman. Perhaps the most disturbing story in the documentary involves Mark Ryan, an aspiring model from Cincinnati, Ohio, who turned to drink after being abused in Hollywood. His parents, Fred and Jane, appear throughout the film, initially proudly showing off Mark’s high school sports photos and modeling shots. Then as the film progresses, they talk about how he returned from Hollywood withdrawn and broken. After attempting to give up booze cold-turkey, he suffered an alcohol-withdrawal seizure and is now confined to a wheelchair, unable to speak or feed himself. His friend Egan is seen visiting him at the nursing home, where he needs 24/7 medical care. And his father is in tears as he recounts finding legal papers in Mark’s bedroom recounting the sexual abuse he suffered in Hollywood. Some filmgoers who saw Friday’s screening believe if Berg had concentrated on Mark’s story she would probably have had another award-winning documentary on her hands. Instead, An Open Secret has become tangled up in Egan’s allegations against Singer, whose girlfriend, Michelle Clunie, is expecting their first baby. Familiar faces: Diff’rent Strokes star Todd Bridges (left) also talks in the documentary about abuse he suffered as a child star and Corey Feldman (right) is seen in archive footage discussing his own experiences . Accused: Marty Weiss, a talent agent, pleaded no contest in 2012 to two counts of committing lewd acts . His lawyer Martin Singer, who is not related to the Usual Suspects director, told MailOnline: ‘My client and his representatives have not seen the movie. ‘It’s disappointing and sad that Amy Berg would rely on the word of Michael Egan, a proven liar, who recently was admonished by a federal judge for lying in court. ‘Egan continues to lie about our client. He has no credibility at all and can hardly be considered a reliable source for Berg’s so-called documentary.’","An Open Secret, by Oscar-nominated documentarian Amy Berg, debuted at the DOC NYC festival Friday .

"Freed: Terry Borgia, 63, is set to be released from prison following three mistrials over her grandson's murder . A grandmother is on the verge of being freed from prison today, three years after she was accused of drowning her four-year-old grandson in the bath. Terry Borgia, 63, has been in jail since January 2010 for the first-degree murder of  DeAngelo Tobia at her apartment in Clinton Township, Detroit. There have been three mistrials in Borgia's case - the latest this month when proceedings ended in a hung jury. They unanimously agreed that she was not guilty of first-degree murder but jurors could not reach an agreement on lesser charges. The judge at Macomb County Circuit Court said on Thursday he would release the grandmother if a supporter came up with $5,000 bond. Her attorney Mark Haddad told the Detroit Free Press: 'I’m almost tempted to do it myself. 'This is an odd case and it’s a deserving lady.' Haddad argued at trial that Terry Borgia is covering for another daughter Tonina Borgia who has mental health problems. Tonina was in the apartment when the four-year-old died but no charges have been brought against her. Mrs Borgia's second daughter and mother of DeAngelo, Amelia Alkasmikha, does not want her mother released and is fighting to find out what happened to her son. Killed: DeAngelo (pictured) was found dead and his mother Amelia Alkasmikha wants her mother to remain in jail for the crime . On her release, Borgia will live with her third daughter Vicki but is not allowed to be in the presence of her grandchildren. Vicki Borgia said she is desperate to help her mother adjust to life outside of jail and has no concern about her children being around her. Verge of release: The judge at Macomb County Court said the grandmother would be released if a supporter could put up the $5,000 bond . At her first trial in February 2010, . Borgia pleaded no contest to first-degree murder. It was declared a . mistrial after police statements were found to be invalid in court. At her second trial, Borgia's daughter Tonina was declared unfit to be a witness after mental health issues and being arrested. Proceedings ended in a hung jury. Borgia's next pre-trial date is set for January 24 where she may face lesser charges.","Terry Borgia, 63, jailed in January 2010 for murder of DeAngelo Tobia ."
"The ultra-bronzed woman dubbed Tanning Mom - following claims that she took her then five-year-old daughter into a tanning booth - has big sunbathing plans now that the criminal case against her has been dropped. Patricia Krentcil, 44, a mother-of-five from Nutley, New Jersey, told NBC News that she wants to go 'somewhere . hot so I can fry like a bacon and come back and say, ''Ha! Ha! You can't . arrest me for lying in the sun.'' She also revealed that she has been working on a tanning lotion line, titled Real Tan Mom Healthy Glow, in a bid to pay back the thousands in legal bills she owes. Scroll down for video . Tanning Mom Patricia Krentcil appeared on This Morning via webcam to defend herself and her tanning habits . Mrs . Krentcil was arrested last April and charged with second-degree child endangerment for allegedly bringing her young daughter into a tanning booth. The girl, who has fair skin and red hair, told a school nurse she had 'gone tanning with mommy' when staff at her school asked her about burns on her skin. However a jury in Newark, New Jersey did not indict her in the end. Moving . on from the dropped charges last week, Mrs Krentcil is now looking at ways to cash in on her notoriety, and along with her tanning lotion line she is working on a book and launching herself as a comedian. 'My love of tanning started when I was about 23... Everyone has some form of addictions and I liked to tan' Following the reports in the press she was dubbed the world's worst mother in the U.S. and today Mrs Krentcil appeared on This Morning to defend herself. 'My love of tanning started when I was about 23. Everyone has some form of addictions and I liked to tan - but I never put Anna in the room. 'But I'm not tanning anymore and I was thinking how stupid it really is,' she said from a studio in New York. Speaking about the accusations that she took her red-haired daughter in the tanning booth following burns on her pale skin, Mrs Krentcil  said: 'It's not a booth, its a room like what I'm sitting in right now with a tanning table - but she was never in the booth, I don't know how many times I have to say it.' Patricia vehemently denied taking her daughter tanning when speaking to Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby . The New Jersey mother was arrested for child endangerment after she took her five year old daughter to a tanning salon . The saga surrounding Mrs Krentcil began when her fair-skinned, red-haired daughter Anna's teacher noticed serious burns . on the then five-year-old's body . Explaining the burns she said: 'She had a half a day, she's out in the pool and she's a redhead and had just a little bit of sunburn on her back and if she would have been in a tanning booth it would have been her whole body.' She added: 'I was set up in this whole mess - its not true. When you ask about justice over here, I don't think there isn't any - there are liars and its very upsetting. 'If we go to court, I have witnesses. This is a big misunderstanding on everyone's part - I know exactly what happened, there's a camera in the place, the owners know I didn't do that. Living hell: Patricia Krentcil, pictured left, said her life had become 'a living hell' since she was arrested for allegedly taking her six-year-old daughter, right, to a salon last April . In the spotlight: The tanning addict made headlines last year after being accused of taking her then five-year-old daughter to a tanning booth . 'It's very frustrating. We just want to be left alone. I didn't do it - there's evidence that I didn't do it, and if they proceed on with it, so will I.' After a month abstaining from her sunbed habit, the New Jersey mother revealed a lighter new look in an issue of In Touch last month. Although the 44-year-old says most people think she looks better less bronzed she said she felt 'weird and pale.' On the show today, speaking about her love of tanning beds, she said: 'I haven't been there in six months.' Tanning Mom has made quite a name for herself because of her brash behaviour. She was recently kicked off the stage . during an alcohol-fuelled appearance at a New York drag show, where . witnesses claim she shouted expletives at the audience, kicked over her . wine glass, and even tried to 'attack' the drag queen hosting the event. Her tanning days have taken a toll and she is barely recognisable compared to a fresh-faced photo of her in her twenties . Her latest look is a far cry from a fresh-faced twenty year old shown in a series of monochrome shots taken in her twenties. The cleavage-baring swimwear photos are thought to have been snapped as she tried to break into the world of glamour modelling. The shots serve as evidence of how the 44-year-old's excessive tanning habit has affected her skin over the past two decades.","''Tanning Mom' can't wait to go sunbathing now her court case is over .

"A rigorous walk could hold the key to slowing the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s in later life. A natural chemical produced by the body during exercise could one day be given as an injection to inhibit the diseases, researchers say. The protein, called FNDC5, is produced by muscular exertion and is released into the bloodstream as a hormone called irisin. A rigorous walk could hold the key to slowing the onset of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's in later life . They hope to use it to keep the neurons in the human brain healthy while also making new ones. ‘What is exciting is that a natural substance can be given in the bloodstream that can mimic some of the effects of endurance exercise on the brain,’ said professor Bruce Spiegelman, from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ‘Our results indicate that FNDC5/irisin has the ability to control a very important neuro-protective pathway in the brain.’ In the study, laboratory mice regularly ran on a wheel for 30 days. The exercise spurred a rise in the FNDC5 protein. That in turn increased a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic protein (BDNF) in a part of the brain involved in learning and memory. A natural chemical produced by the body during exercise could one day be given as an injection to inhibit the diseases, researchers say . They used a harmless virus to deliver the protein to mice through the bloodstream, in hopes the FNDC5 could reach the brain and raise BDNF production. Seven days later, they examined the mouse brains and observed a significant increase in BDNF in the hippocampus area of the brain. Professor Spiegelman says more research is needed and the next step is to develop a stable form of irisin.","Walking could hold key to slowing onset of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's .

"Brendan Rodgers has revealed that Raheem Sterling has been offered a 'wonderful deal' to remain at Liverpool. But the England international has yet to agree terms after talks stalled for a number of months and Rodgers said the club would not be held to ransom over his future. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel and Dominic King, who have been following the negotiations closely, answer all the burning questions on the Sterling situation. Raheem Sterling's contract negotiations at Liverpool continue to drag on, despite the club offering the England international a 'wonderful deal' in the words of manager Brendan Rodgers . WILL STERLING STAY AT LIVERPOOL OR MOVE TO PASTURES NEW? Sami Mokbel: My gut feeling is that he'll sign a new contract at Liverpool. Despite the long-winded contract talks, there's certainly a willingness from Sterling to stay. He's enjoying his football and enjoys being a key first-team member. There's no guarantees of that anywhere else. But it's also key to remember that Sterling, having tasted it for the first time this season, is keen to continue playing in the Champions League. It's viewed as a key part in his overall development as a player. How long will he accept being out of Europe's premier club competition? Sterling in action during Saturday's Merseyside derby draw with Everton at Goodison Park . Dominic King: The first thing to point out is that Sterling is happy at Liverpool. He has become an important member of the team and has thrived under Brendan Rodgers' guidance. Sterling has also given no indication that he wants to leave. Plenty of clubs would want to sign one of the top young players in Europe but Liverpool have absolutely no appetite to sell. There is no prospect of him moving anywhere soon. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to tie Sterling down to a long-term deal at the club . WHY ARE THESE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS TAKING THIS AMOUNT OF TIME? Sami Mokbel: Contract negotiations for top players are always long, drawn-out affairs. Look at Eden Hazard, for example. Talks over a new contract at Chelsea started months before Sterling's and there's still no confirmation of his commitment. Brendan Rodgers has identified Sterling as one of the premier young players in Europe. Sterling's advisors are only right to bide their time over ensuring they secure the best possible deal for their client. Sterling celebrates after scoring in Liverpool's 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal at Anfield last season . Dominic King: Liverpool have put together a package that Rodgers described as a 'wonderful deal'. It will see his wages go from their current £35,000 per week basic to, with incentives and bonuses, a figure that could get close to £100,000 per week. Sterling's advisors are playing hard and are looking to secure the absolute maximum for their client. At the moment they have reached deadlock. Sterling is set for a bright future for both club and country - he is a central part of Roy Hodgson's plans . ARE LIVERPOOL FANS GETTING FRUSTRATED? Sami Mokbel: Probably. It's the uncertainty that will keep them agitated. Liverpool fans, traditionally, aren't used to losing their top players. In Sterling they are faced with that very prospect. The landscape of English and European football has changed, however, as Liverpool are no longer the pinnacle. Other clubs are now viewed as being more prestigious. Supporters must accept that. Rodgers and Sterling embrace on the touchline during Liverpool's win at Norwich City last season . Dominic King: Yes, they want the situation sorted out - that much was obvious from Steven Gerrard's comments ahead of the Merseyside derby - but they are more frustrated with the stories that have come out. The noise around the situation needs to be turned down. There is no sense, though, that they are frustrated with Sterling as individual. He is not the one doing the negotiating. Sterling cracks a smile in training at Melwood last week as Liverpool prepared for the derby with Everton . WHAT ARE STERLING'S ALTERNATIVES TO ANFIELD IF NEGOTIATIONS FALL DOWN? Sami Mokbel: In short, the elite of European football. There'll be no shortage of high-profile takers should Sterling's time at Anfield come to an end. Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are monitoring the situation closely. Sportsmail understands that Manchester City and Chelsea have sat up and taken notice of the contract impasse. Sterling celebrates scoring in Liverpool's FA Cup win over Bolton Wanderers last week . Dominic King: That question is hypothetical at the minute. Liverpool are not looking to sell the player, Sterling does not want to leave and there are still another four months of the season remaining, so where would he go at this moment? Of course plenty of clubs would be interested in signing Sterling but would Liverpool do business with one of their rivals in the Barclays Premier League? That would be highly unlikely. Would a move abroad suit him at just 20 years of age? Again that is open to debate.","Raheem Sterling is yet to sign a new long-term contract with Liverpool .

"Following the capture of Mexico's richest and most dangerous drug lord on Saturday, questions are now being asked about the whereabouts of his 24-year-old beauty queen third wife who gave birth to two of his children in 2011. Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was nabbed in a U.S.-backed raid on a resort condo in Mazatlan, after his former bodyguards pointed Mexican officials to the elusive kingpin's compound of seven homes in the Pacific coast town of Culiacan. It seems Guzman - who is worth an estimated $1billion - was getting tired of living the safe life after 12 years in hiding, and let down his guard to enjoy his wealth in the resort town popular with American tourists. Scroll down for video . Powerful: Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines at a navy hanger in Mexico City, Mexico, after finally being captured Saturday following years on the run . Guzman was caught with an unidentified woman, but his young wife and former-beauty queen Emma Coronel was unaccounted for. Coronel is either Guzman's third or fourth wife and they were married in 2011 when she was just 18-years-old. She caught his eye after winning the Miss Coffee and Guava beauty contest. Coronel, who is the daughter of one of Guzman's top deputies, Ines Coronel Barreas, was last seen re-entering Mexico in August 2011. The then 22-year-old had just given birth to Guzman's twin daughters at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, north of Los Angeles, California. Mom: Guzman married Coronel when she was just 18-years-old. In 2011, when she was 22, Coronel gave birth to Guzman's twin daughters in a hospital in LA county . Where is she: Guzman's wife and former beauty queen Emma Coronel was not accounted for in news of the raid . Because Coronel is both an American and Mexican citizen - she is allowed to travel freely between the two countries. With . the DEA and U.S. Marshals Service reported to have been 'heavily . involved' in Guzman’s capture, U.S. politicians are now calling for him . to be extradited to the U.S., to face drug trafficking charges here. U.S. Rep Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland . Security, argues that extradition will help insure that Guzman remains . behind bars, since he has twice escaped from Mexican prisons through . bribery. That last time Guzman escaped, he was about to be sent to the U.S. 'My . sense in talking with Homeland Security officials and others last night . is that we were able to penetrate his circle, get people within the . organization to cooperate,' said McCaul. The noose started tightening around Guzman earlier this month. Federal . forces began sweeping through Culiacan, capital of the Pacific coast . state of Sinaloa - closing streets, raiding houses, seizing automatic . weapons, drugs and money, and arresting a series of men Mexican . officials carefully described to reporters as top officials for Zambada. Guzman's downfall began last week when several of his Sinaloa cartel henchmen were arrested by Mexican authorities. On . February 13, a man known as '19,' whom officials called the new chief . of assassins for Ismael Zambada, one of Guzman's top henchmen, was . arrested with two other men on the highway to the coastal resort city of . Mazatlan. Drug lord: Joaquin 'El Chapa' Guzman is led into a military helicopter following his arrest on Saturday . Most wanted: Guzman is one of the most wanted men in the world and is considered the 'Osama bin Laden of the drug war' Four days . later, a man described as a member of the Sinaloa cartel's upper ranks . was seized along with 4,000 hollowed-out cucumbers and bananas stuffed . with cocaine. In the . middle of this week, a 43-year-old known by the nickname '20' and . described as Zambada's chief of security, was arrested transporting more . cocaine-stuffed produce. By the middle of the week at least 10 Sinaloa henchmen had been seized. A . U.S. law enforcement official said on Saturday that at least some were . actually security for Guzman, and authorities used them to obtain . information that helped lead to the head of the cartel. Agents . learned that Guzman, 56, had started coming down from his isolated . mountain hideouts to enjoy the comforts of Culiacan and Mazatlan, said . Michael S. Vigil, a former senior DEA official who was briefed on the . operation. 'That was a fatal error,' Vigil said. Escape: Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 by hiding in a laundry bin. Authorities believe he had inside help . Across the border: Coronel returned to Mexico legally after giving birth to her twins . Working . on the information gleaned from Guzman's bodyguards, Mexican marines . swarmed the house of Guzman's ex-wife but struggled to batter down the . steel-reinforced door, according to Mexican authorities and former U.S. law-enforcement officials briefed on the operation. As . the marines forced their way in, Guzman fled through a secret door . beneath a bathtub down a corrugated steel ladder into a network of . tunnels and sewer canals that connect to six other houses in Culiacan, . the officials said. Guzman . fled south to Mazatlan. On his heels, a team of U.S. Drug Enforcement . Administration agents set up a base of operations with Mexican marines . in the city, according to the current U.S. law-enforcement official. Early . on Saturday morning, Guzman's reign came to an end without a shot . fired. Marines closed the beachside road in front of the Miramar . condominiums, a 10-story, pearl-colored building with white balconies . overlooking the Pacific and a small pool in front. Smashing . down the door of an austerely decorated fourth-floor condo, they seized . the country's most-wanted man at 6:40am, a few minutes after the sun . rose. A neighbor who declined to identify himself for fear of retaliation said the apartment had only been occupied for two days. An . employee of the building's cleaning staff said that clothes were strewn . across the floor and bed in the condo, and humble domestic appliances - . a microwave, a floor fan, a flat-screen TV on a small table - were left . inside. Raid: Clothes and toiletries are scattered across a bed where Guzman was found with an unidentified woman . Dawn raid: A pancake left in a frying pan can be seen on the stove of the condominium where Guzman was arrested . Trapped: Marines broke into the seaside home in a complex where apartments are rented for about $1,200 a month . Photos of the . apartment published by a local newspaper showed cheap and unglamorous . furnishings. Inside the condo, the photos showed little food or liquor: . just a couple of dozen eggs on a shelf. A bag from a low-end supermarket . lay on the floor. Mexican . officials said that Guzman was detained along with a man they . identified as Carlos Manuel Hoo Ramirez. It's still unclear what role . Ramirez may have played in the cartel. A . U.S. law-enforcement official with direct knowledge of the killing of . Zambada's main lieutenant in November described it as part of a . concerted binational effort to decapitate the Sinaloa cartel. The . organization became the focus of U.S. and Mexican attention after a . string of arrests and slaying of the heads of other cartels, most . notably the seizure of brutal Zetas cartel head Miguel Angel Trevino . Morales in July. 'Who . are the only big fish left in the country? We can't just twiddle our . thumbs,' said the official who was not authorized to speak to . journalists and spoke on condition of anonymity. 'Now we focus on the biggest elephant in the room. It's by virtue of default.' Got him: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was arrested in an early morning raid in the resort town of Mazatlan . Guzman's . arrest appears certain to all but quash U.S. concerns that Pena Nieto's . administration has been reducing cooperation with U.S. law-enforcement, . a hallmark of his predecessor Felipe Calderon's six-year term. 'This . shows that cooperation is working, and that it's discreet and based on . intelligence-gathering,' said Raul Benitez, a security expert at . Mexico's National Autonomous University. 'This is, without a doubt, the most important success of Pena Nieto's administration.' By early afternoon, Guzman was marched across the tarmac of the Mexican marines' hanger at the Mexico City airport. The . man who eluded Mexican authorities for more than a decade looked pudgy, . bowed and middle-aged in a white button-down shirt and beltless black . jeans. Indictments: Guzman faces federal indictments in the U.S. for drug-trafficking charges . After his 2001 . escape in a laundry truck from a prison he came to control through . bribery, Guzman was rumored to live everywhere from Argentina to . Mexico's 'Golden Triangle,' a mountainous, marijuana-growing region . straddling the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. The Sinaloa Cartel grew deadlier and more powerful, taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the U.S. border. Guzman . was hit with multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the U.S. as his drug empire stretched throughout North America and extended . branches into Europe and Australia. Guzman's . play for power against local cartels caused a bloodbath in Tijuana and . made Ciudad Juarez one of the deadliest cities in the world. In . 2013, he was named 'Public Enemy No. 1' by the Chicago Crime . Commission, only the second person to get that distinction after U.S. prohibition-era crime boss Al Capone. Extradition: It's unclear when - or if - Guzman will be extradited to the U.S., where he faces federal charges over drug trafficking allegations . Paradise: Guzman was arrested at a hotel in the resort city of Mazatlan, Sinaloa . Number one: Guzman is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion and has been named public enemy number one by multiple law enforcement agencies . He . appeared in only a handful of photos during his years on the run, . staring straight into the camera of an anonymous photographer and . defiantly brandishing an automatic rifle. On . Saturday, as he was walked before the press, his hands were cuffed . behind him and a masked marine pushed down his head with a black-gloved . hand, as if to make clear that Guzman is now under state control. Guzman . said nothing, and looked subdued as he reappeared before the world for a . few seconds before disappearing into the cargo bay of a helicopter . waiting to take him to prison.","Mexico's richest and most dangerous drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was captured on Saturday .

"Shaun White pulled out of the Olympic slopestyle contest Wednesday after being dinged up on a course that riders are criticizing as unduly harsh. White issued a statement, saying that after much deliberation, he has decided to forgo the new high-speed, obstacle-filled snowboarding event and concentrate on snagging a third straight gold on the halfpipe next week. 'With the practice runs I have taken, even after course modifications and watching fellow athletes get hurt, the potential risk of injury is a bit too much for me to gamble my other Olympics goals on,' White said in a statement. Scroll Down for Video . Too treacherous? Snowboarding Olympic gold medalist and favorite to win the Sochi games Shaun White has withdrawn from the slopestyle event after he and others characterized the course as a little too dangerous . White, who was among the favorites in the new Olympic event, jammed his left wrist during practice Tuesday and when he came off the slopestyle course, he called it 'a little intimidating.' The announcement comes despite White's claims that his wrist injury was a non-issue. 'It's one of those things that it's going to be annoying, but I don't think it will affect my performance,' White told USA Today after the injury. Slopestyle is a speed-packed trip down the mountain, filled with rails, bumps and, most notably, steeply angled jumps that allow riders to flip two, sometimes three times, before landing. White hurt his wrist on one of the takeoff ramps, which one top rider, Canadian Mark McMorris, said were built 'kind of obnoxiously tall.' White, 27, has been dealing with a number of nagging injuries during a winter in which he was one of the few riders trying to compete in both events. The wrist added to a list that includes his shoulder and ankle, both injured during qualifying events for the U.S. team. Slippery slope: Here, White takes a jump during a slopestyle training session at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia, prior to the 2014 Winter Olympics . Not the only one: White is one of several snowboarders who've been injured practicing on Sochi's slopestyle course, including a Norwegian medal contender who broke his collarbone Monday . His focus will now solely be on next Tuesday's contest in the halfpipe, which is essentially a hollowed-out ice shell with 22-foot sidewalls. There is danger there, but unlike slopestyle, it's based mostly on the types of tricks the riders try and not the setup of the pipe. In a news conference about an hour before he gave first word of his decision to the Today show, White was asked whether halfpipe was more important to him. 'For me, I definitely feel the halfpipe carries a bit more weight, a bit more pressure. I guess that's fair enough to say,' he said. He deemed his jammed wrist as nothing serious and said reports about it were overblown. But he said there remained serious issues with the slopestyle course. 'There are definitely concerns about the course,' he said. 'It's been interesting to see how it's developed and changed over the past couple days. The big question is, if it will continue to change. Because every day, they have riders meetings and they give feedback. Sometimes there's changes, sometimes there's not.' Sebastion Toutant of Canada's team said the slopestyle course felt like 'jumping out of a building,' according to Today.com. Finland's Roope Tonteri agreed, calling the course 'pretty sketchy.' 'I just don't want to get injured. It's not a really fun course to ride,' Tonteri said. Dangerous: Norway's Torstein Horgmo was stretchered off the mountain Monday after injuring after breaking his collarbone on the very course White has decided not to vie for gold on .","The snowboarder wants to focus on a third straight halfpipe Olympic gold .

"As early as late 600s Japan there have been 'female entertainers' hosting gatherings, pouring sake and offering company to men. Known as 'saburuko' - translated as 'serving girls' - some of these women sold sexual services, while others simply hosted high-class occasions. And around 794 the culture of the geisha began to emerge: women who men would visit for romantic and sexual pleasure. Traditional geisha - heavily made-up, immaculately dressed and coquettish entertainers - emerged in 18th century Japan, and these women did not officially sell sex - that being the preserve of a different group of female entertainers known as Oiran. But this stunning collection of photographs of geisha during the second half of the 20th century shows how the ancient Japanese art found its place in a more modern world full of businessmen, beer and steam baths. Scroll down for video . A group of geisha girls being instructed by their teacher, circa 1955 .

Others show geisha giggling coquettishly while hosting businessmen over sushi suppers, giggling and pouring sake. In a third photo a geisha is seen walking home in her platform flip-flops at the end of her shift, glancing back at the camera past a row of umbrellas being dried out in an alleyway. The female entertainers are also pictured learning to play the samisen, a traditional Japanese stringed instrument, pouring beer into the mouths of 1950s businessmen while they relax in steam baths, giving men massages by trampling all over their bodies, and getting ready for work in beautiful patterned kimonos and high flip-flops.

Enclosed pleasure quarters known as . yūkaku were built in the 16th century in Japan, outside of which prostitution was . be illegal, and within which yūjo (play women) would be classified and . licensed. The highest yūjo class was the geisha's predecessor, called oiran, a combination of actress and . prostitute, who performed erotic dances as part of a new art known as kabuku. The talented courtesans entertained clients by dancing, singing, and playing . music, while some specialised as poets or calligraphers. Group of geishas washing and dressing, circa 1880 . Japanese geisha dancing and playing music in 1901 . Near the turn of the eighteenth century those who specialised in 'entertaining' emerged as geisha, and many of these were men. The first woman known to have . called herself geisha was a Fukagawa prostitute, a skilled singer and shamisen-player named Kikuya, in about 1750. Geisha who worked within the pleasure quarters were forbidden to sell sex as it was the preserve of the oiran - though prostitution was legal up until the . 1900s, so it was practiced in many quarters throughout Japan.

The officer, who was the force’s Olympics security poster girl in 2012, learned she will face no further action over claims linked to a dispute with her ex-husband. Last night, she said: ‘I’m appalled and disgusted that the police put me through 13 months of hell simply because I stood up to the Met Police and challenged the discrimination at work. ‘As a working officer, I know these allegations would not normally have been investigated in this way and for this long. 'I was punished for challenging them and they tried to smear me. Lessons need to be learned by the police, and quickly.’ Sussex Police had investigated a string of incidents which allegedly took place in 2012-2013. But the Crown Prosecution Service found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges of perverting the course of  justice and harassment. A claim of common assault was not pursued as the alleged incident took place more than two years ago and there is a six-month limit on the offence. A further claim that PC Howard possessed an indecent image of a child was dropped as the photograph was of her daughter. This month, the elite officer was awarded £37,000 for suffering appalling treatment in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group. Judges found PC Howard was targeted for almost a year by a senior officer while working in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group. The decision to end the inquiry is unlikely to be the final chapter in an ongoing acrimonious dispute between PC Howard and the force. The officer, the force's poster girl for the 2012 Olympic Games, right, claims the inquiry into her arrests only went on for so long because she successfully challenged the force over racism and sexual discrimination . She has accused the force of trying to ‘smear’ her by releasing details of her arrest at the hands of The Met and neighbouring Sussex. Senior officers are still considering whether to bring a misconduct case against her, something which could yet end her police career. Earlier this week the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced it will investigate the force over its handling of internal complaints. The tribunal found officers routinely deleted references to discrimination from reports, including one relating to PC Howard. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: ‘We have advised Sussex Police that no further criminal action should be taken.’","Carol Howard, 35, won race and sex discrimination case against Met in July .

"Juventus head coach Massimiliano Allegri has revealed he plans to deploy Paul Pogba in a more advanced role this season. The French midfielder has mainly been used in an orthodox central role since joining Juve two years ago but Allegri wants to push him further forward to utilise his attacking talents better. 'I will try to use Pogba more in attack,' Allegri said in Indonesia on the Italian club's pre-season tour. Pressing matters: Allegri and Pogba talk to the media in Indonesia on Tuesday . Middle man: Pogba is considered to be among the best midfielder in world football . 'He is one of the best young players in the world, with enormous technical and physical qualities. Having said that, there is also still plenty of room for improvement.' Pogba joined Juventus from Manchester United two years ago and has scored 14 goals in 88 games in Italy, establishing himself as one of the best midfielders in Europe. He has been consistently linked with a move back to United or to Chelsea, while his team-mate and fellow midfielder Arturo Vidal has also been targeted by the Old Trafford club. Staying put: Allegri also insisted that Vidal (centre) would not be leaving Juventus this summer . But Allegri - who took over at Juve after Antonio Conte resigned last month - was quick to dismiss any suggestions that either of the pair may leave this summer. He said: 'Vidal and Pogba are delighted to be here and I am delighted to coach them.'","Paul Pogba is about to start his third season at Juventus .

"A Facebook page has been created for users to report incidents of 'Islamophobia' and anti-Muslim sentiments as the Muslim community fears backlash after the counter-terror raids that took place on Thursday morning. 'Islamophobia Register Australia'  was created on Facebook just two days before Australia experienced the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history. The operation saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's north-west and in three Brisbane suburbs. Scroll down for video . The Facebook page, Islamophobia Register Australia', joined on Tuesday September 16 and has over 1,500 followers . The operation saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's north-west and in three Brisbane suburbs . Members of the Sydney Muslim community prayed prior to a rally in Lakemba, Sydney on Thursday after an overnight counter-terrorism raid took place across western Sydney . Following the raids, stories of police brutality against women and children emerged  which prompted the Islamic political party Hizb-ut-Tahrir to organise  protests defending their rights as Islamic Australians. It appears the Facebook page is run by members of the Muslim community who have reacted to the counter-terror raids and fear for innocent Islamic people who face mistreatment in Australia. The page calls on Muslims to safely air reports of discrimination. 'Please take time to send us reports of any Islamophobic incidents either by submitting a private message via this page or by sending us an email to islamophobiaregister@gmail.com.' It publicly shares reports  made by Facebook users. The page describes seven incidents of 'Islamophobia' which include women dressed in hijabs verbally abused in the streets of Sydney, a woman claiming a man tried to run her over as she crossed the road, and a Senior cleric and member of the Australian National Imams Council detained for over two and a half hours at Sydney airport. The page also claims it has received hate mail, reinforcing the need for the forum's existence. The Facebook page provides information for victims of 'Islamophobia' seeking legal information . To date, we have had reports of: . - a mosque being defaced in Queensland . - a Senior cleric and member of the Australian National Imams Council detained for over 2.5 hours at Sydney airport without having his flight re-booked or reimbursed for costs incurred . - direct threats issued against the Grand Mufti of Australia, Lakemba Mosque and Auburn Mosque from anonymous members of the Australian Defence League . - women in hijab verbally abused in the streets of Sydney, at shopping centres and whilst driving . - One woman in particular claimed that a man almost ran her over as she tried to cross a school crossing outside her daughter's school in the Inner West of Sydney . - countless examples of social media vitriol targeting Muslims . The page has unfortunately also attracted a lot of hate mail, bigotry and vitriol which perhaps ironically proves why such a register is required in the first place. Victims of 'Islamophobia' are provided with support information that is posted to the page. It offers contact details for counselling and free legal consultations. 'Were you directly or indirectly affected by the current issues affecting our community, or even feeling overwhelmed by it all? 'Mission of Hope's crisis intervention centre at Hayat House is hosting a CRISIS CENTRE DROP-IN FOR INDIVIDUALS / FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT POLICE RAIDS IN OUR COMMUNITY,' a post on the page reads. The page has only existed for six days but has already attracted over 1,500 followers. Daily Mail Australia contacted the 'Islamophobia Register Australia' for comment. Facebook user Jason Dickeson responded to Daily Mail Australia's comment on the page expressing backlash against the purpose of the page. He believes the page is biased and deletes comments made by non-Muslim Australians who have been threatened by Muslims. 'You should be asking them why they have taken down the posts of people that have had Muslims threatening them in the streets. 'Can we come to your legal service and get advice from you when they have threatened other people for no reason other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time? 'Can the lady from yesterday get advice about the Muslim lady making a throat slitting gesture towards her for no reason?', Mr Dickeson posted on Sunday. But four hours before Mr Dickeson's comment,  Facebook page posted a comment insisting 'all unrelated posts that include profanities and/or are offensive will be deleted from the page'. To submit a report to the Facebook page a person must provide their full name, street address, email address and phone number.

"MSNBC anchor Mara Schiavocampo had a rocky experience trying to sign up for Obamacare as the insurance marketplaces opened up to a rocky start Tuesday. The long anticipated rollout came despite the government shutdown and the snags are expected to contribute to a slow start to enrollment and give increased ammo to Obama's Republican foes. At least 25 of the 36 federally-run, state-specific marketplace sites posted error messages soon after open enrollment began at 8am, so Schiavocampo was far from alone. Waiting: Mara Schiavocampo ran into difficulties as she tried to sign up for the newly launched health-care exchanges. She gave up trying to sign up for a plan after 15 minutes online and about 20 minutes on the phone . Schiavocampo described her experience in real time as she created an account at HealthCare.gov. She created a username and password and at first the process was typical. 'Pretty much like it would be for any other website,' she said. After she created her account, Schiavocampo moved on to step two in the process, where she entered her and her family's information. It was at step three, when the anchor would have chosen from among Obamacare plans, when she hit a snag. Glitches: Heavy Internet traffic and system problems plagued the launch of the new health insurance exchanges Tuesday morning . 'I keep getting this error page,' she said, 'It won't let me progress.' After two phone calls and a combined 35 minutes trying to enroll in Obamacare, Schiavocampo gave up. 'If I were signing up for myself, this is where my patience would be exhausted,' she said. The website was showing signs of trouble handling the volume of consumers on October 1, the first day of the . six-month open enrollment period. Federal officials are aware of the website problems and say they are working to address it as quickly as possible. U.S. Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters . says officials ""have built a dynamic system and are prepared to make adjustments . as needed and improve the consumer experience."" The site for Maryland, which is running its own exchange, . displays a message saying 'We open at 12:00 noon on October 1st.' Other callers to the federal call center where consumers can get . help by telephone have reported long wait times. The federal government also announced delays for small business and Spanish-language signups. System down: Screenshot of the HHS website for the Obamacare exchanges . The biggest expansion of society's . safety net since Medicare is now in the hands of consumers, and most of . their concerns don't revolve around ideology and policy details. People want to know if they can afford . the premiums, if the coverage will be solid, where the bureaucratic . pitfalls are and if new federal and state websites will really demystify . shopping for health insurance. Full answers may take months. Open for business: Obamacare's online insurance marketplace, pictured, went live at midnight. You can find it at www.healthcare.gov/marketplace . People who don't have access to job-based health insurance can start shopping right away for subsidized private policies. Or they can wait to sign up as late as December 15 and still get coverage by January 1. Consumers also could run into problems getting their right subsidy amounts. People with complicated tax returns and extended families living under the same roof could find they need personal assistance to work out the issues. Referrals to state Medicaid programs might go smoothly in some states, not so well in others. 'As this unveils, it is going to be very clear that everything can't be done on a computer,' Christine Ferguson, director of Rhode Island's marketplace, said in an interview prior to the launch. 'But by Day 60 to 120, and the year after that, it's going to get a lot more user-friendly and effective.' Message: Obama recorded a video message for U.S. military personnel in which he avoided blaming the GOP, saying only that 'Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility' Eventually, at least half the nation's nearly 50 million uninsured people are expected to get coverage through the Affordable Care Act, either through subsidized private plans sold in the new markets or an expanded version of Medicaid in states accepting it for low-income adults. Immigrants in the country illegally will be the largest group remaining uninsured. People who do have access to employer-based plans will also see changes. Starting January 1, virtually all Americans will have a legal obligation to carry health insurance or face fines. Passing up the company medical plan in exchange for a bigger paycheck may no longer be an option. But employees who lose their jobs, entrepreneurs starting their own businesses and people in between school and work could have an easier time getting coverage. Also as of January 1, a pre-existing medical condition will no longer be a barrier to getting health insurance. A partial government shutdown, driven by Republican opponents of increasing the federal role in health care, will not stop what they call 'Obamacare.' Core provisions and benefits are shielded from annual budget battles. If other government services are shut down, the health care overhaul can largely keep going - much like Social Security and Medicare. 'Shutdown or no shutdown we're ready to go,' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Monday. Federally operated markets in 36 states open at 8 a.m. Eastern time. The remaining states are running their own markets. Shutdown: John Boehner, pictured, and President Obama squared off in a proverbial sparring match that ended up in a government shutdown on Monday night . Polls show the country remains divided over the law, with opponents outnumbering supporters. Nonetheless, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey released over the weekend found 56 percent of Americans disapproved cutting off funding to expand coverage for the uninsured, as congressional Republicans have done. The poll also found people in a fog about what the law means for them. Nearly three-fourths of the uninsured were unaware of the new insurance markets opening to serve them. In states not expanding Medicaid, millions of uninsured people below the federal poverty level will likely be shut out of coverage. That's the case in Texas and Florida - both of which have large uninsured populations - and in many, but not all, Republican-led states. It's because under the law, people below the poverty line - an individual making $11,490, a family of four $23,550 - can only get the new coverage through expanded Medicaid. And the Supreme Court gave states the right to opt out. The other arm of 'Obamacare's' coverage expansion - subsidized private insurance through the new markets - is mainly geared to uninsured people in the middle class. The administration is hoping to sign up 7 million the first year. Young, healthy adults are prime customers, since they'll help offset the cost of caring for sicker people sure to sign up once insurers can no longer reject them. Kevin Maass of Fairfax, Virginia, has been uninsured for more than a year, since he turned 26 and could no longer stay on his parents' insurance. He's got a background in statistics that he hopes to apply to criminology, but he's been working temporary jobs while looking for permanent employment in law enforcement. 'Not having health insurance has made me a little bit more cautious,' said Maass. 'I like to snowboard, but it's given me second thoughts. Heaven forbid I should break my wrist or my arm.' Maass thinks he might be able to afford $100 to $200 a month for insurance. Early indications are that he'll find plenty of options. However, plans with the lowest premiums will have high deductibles and copayments, which means sizable out-of-pocket costs if he gets sick or has an accident. Nonetheless, Maass says he's definitely planning to check out the health insurance market. 'My parents have been pushing for me to get health insurance,' he said. 'I might as well at least get something rather than pay (a fine) to not have anything.'","Mara Schiavocampo called a helpline and was left on hold for 20 minutes before giving up .

"New federal Ebola response squads - likened to public health SWAT teams - have been prepared and are on standby to rush to any U.S. city where new Ebola cases are identified, CDC officials announced on Wednesday. The CDC Ebola Response Teams (CERTS) will consist of 10-20 people who can be sent to any hospital with a new case of Ebola is lab-confirmed, or even before confirmation, if health officials believe a person is very likely to be infected. The brief for the second set of teams - Fast Assessment and Support Teams (FAST) - is to help prepare hospitals in cities deemed most likely to see future Ebola cases. Three teams have already been sent out to New York, Chicago and Washington. New federal Ebola response squads - likened to public health SWAT teams - have been prepared and are on standby to rush to any U.S. city where new Ebola cases are identified, CDC officials announced on Wednesday. The teams are 'ready to go - boom - if we have another case of Ebola,' said Dr. Jordan Tappero, one of the leaders of CDC's Ebola response effort. The government has been criticized for its handling of the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian, came down with Ebola symptoms last month, a few days after arriving in Dallas from West Africa. He was admitted to a Dallas hospital in late September and died on October 8. Duncan's illness and death created public fear as health officials had to track down and monitor scores of people he came in contact with. Ebola coordinator Ron Klain listens to President Barack Obama speak to the media about the government's Ebola response in the Oval Office: President Obama last week announced the need for Ebola rapid response teams that he had likened to SWAT teams . No one in the community has been infected, but two nurses who cared for him were. Since then, CDC officials have admitted that they should have sent more people to Dallas when Duncan's case first surfaced - particularly infection control specialists, who could have provided better guidance to the hospital. President Barack Obama had first announced a push for a faster federal reaction last week. 'We want a rapid response team, a SWAT team essentially, from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible, hopefully within 24 hours, so that they are taking the local hospital step by step though what needs to be done,' he said. The CDC has developed two sets of teams, identified by the acronyms CERT and FAST: . CERT teams . The CERTs - for CDC Ebola Response Teams - are the squads Obama was talking about. They are to be made up of 10 to 20 people each, who can be sent to a hospital right after a new case of Ebola is lab-confirmed, or even before confirmation, if health officials believe a person is very likely to be infected. They are drawn from a list of roughly 100 CDC workers and others, scattered across the country. No CERT team has been deployed yet but the 20 or so people at the top of the list are on standby, with bags packed. FAST teams . Three FAST teams were assembled last week. These are smaller, preparatory teams: FAST stands for Facility Assessment and Support Teams. They're involved in checking out hospitals that have volunteered to handle Ebola cases, making sure they are ready to handle everything from the first encounter with a patient to the disposal of Ebola-infected medical waste. Hospitals . The government is trying to identify up to 20 hospitals around the country that are designated Ebola referral centers. An emphasis has been on reviewing hospitals in the five cities with airports where all travelers from West Africa are now being funneled. The FAST teams have already been sent to three of them - New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The other two cities are Atlanta and Newark. The government hopes to release a list of primary Ebola hospitals in those five cities this week, CDC officials said. Federal, state or local officials have already named some hospitals. CDC officials confirmed that one is Emory University Hospital in Atlanta - which already has been treating Ebola patients. In Chicago, local health officials this week said four leading hospitals have agreed to handle Ebola patients - Rush University Medical Center, the University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. New York state officials have said they have designated eight hospitals to handle patients diagnosed with Ebola:  New York City's Bellevue Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, Montefiore Hospital Center; North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System; Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse; University of Rochester Medical Center, and Stony Brook University Hospital on Long Island. Other teams . On Sunday, the Pentagon said it's building a 30-person medical support team that could go to help civilian hospitals deal with a future appearance of Ebola. The team is to include 20 critical care nurses, five doctors trained in infectious disease, and five trainers in infectious disease protocols. The military team has a different orientation - they'll be there to provide medical care if a hospital needs more hands. The CERT teams are not there to care for patients. They would be involved in testing, coordinating communications with the public, ensuring that hospital workers are properly protected, and helping to track down people an infected person was in contact with, explained Dr. John T. Brooks, the CDC official overseeing the teams. The CDC also has teams in Ohio and Texas working on Ebola, Brooks said. They are not FAST or CERT teams. They were sent to help officials in those states to help track and prepare for potential cases related to Duncan or to a nurse who treated him and traveled to the Cleveland area.","President Obama last week announced the need for Ebola rapid response teams that he had likened to SWAT teams .

"Anthony Elonis (pictured) was sentenced to four years in prison, after posting violent lyrics about murdering his ex-wife to Facebook . Anthony Elonis claimed he was just kidding when he posted a series of graphically violent rap lyrics on Facebook about killing his estranged wife, shooting up a kindergarten class and attacking an FBI agent. But his wife didn't see it that way. Neither did a federal jury. Elonis, who's from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was convicted of violating a federal law that makes it a crime to threaten another person. In a far-reaching case that probes the limits of free speech over the Internet, the Supreme Court on Monday was to consider whether Elonis' Facebook posts, and others like it, deserve protection under the First Amendment. Elonis argues that his lyrics were simply a crude and spontaneous form of expression that should not be considered threatening if he did not really mean it. The government says it does not matter what Elonis intended, and that the true test of a threat is whether his words make a reasonable person feel threatened. One post about his wife said, 'There's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you. I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts.' The case has drawn widespread attention from free-speech advocates who say comments on Facebook, Twitter and other social media can be hasty, impulsive and easily misinterpreted. They point out that a message on Facebook intended for a small group could be taken out of context when viewed by a wider audience. 'A statute that proscribes speech without regard to the speaker's intended meaning runs the risk of punishing protected First Amendment expression simply because it is crudely or zealously expressed,' said a brief from the American Liberties Union and other groups. But so far, most lower courts have rejected that view, ruling that a 'true threat' depends on how an objective person perceives the message. Scroll down for video . The U.S. Supreme Court will review Elonis' case on Monday. The high court in Washington, DC pictured above on November 18, 2014 . For more than four decades, the Supreme Court has said that 'true threats' to harm another person are not protected speech under the First Amendment. But the court has been careful to distinguish threats from protected speech such as 'political hyperbole' or 'unpleasantly sharp attacks.' Elonis claims he was depressed and that his online posts under the pseudonym 'Tone Dougie' were a way to vent his frustration after his wife left him and he lost his job working at an amusement park. His lawyers say the posts were heavily influenced by rap star Eminem, who has also fantasized in songs about killing his ex-wife. But Elonis' wife testified that the comments made her fear for her life. After she obtained a protective order against him, Elonis wrote a lengthy post mocking court proceedings: 'Did you know that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife?' A female FBI agent later visited Elonis at home to ask him about the postings. Elonis took to Facebook again: 'Little agent lady stood so close, took all the strength I had not to turn the bitch ghost. Pull my knife, flick my wrist and slit her throat.' Elonis was convicted of making threats of violence and sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison. A federal appeals court rejected his claim that his comments were protected by the First Amendment. Elonis claims he was just kidding when he wrote the lyrics and that they should be protected by the First Amendment to free speech . The Obama administration says requiring proof that a speaker intended to be threatening would undermine the law's protective purpose. In its brief to the court, the Justice Department argued that no matter what someone believes about his comments, it does not lessen the fear and anxiety they might cause for other people. 'The First Amendment does not require that a person be permitted to inflict those harms based on an unreasonable subjective belief that his words do not mean what they say,' government lawyers said. The National Center for Victims of Crime, which submitted a brief supporting the government, said judging threats based on the speaker's intent would make stalking crimes even more difficult to prosecute. 'Victims of stalking are financially, emotionally and socially burdened by the crime regardless of the subjective intent of the speaker,' the organization said. The case is Elonis v. United States, 13-983.","Anthony Elonis was sentenced to four years in prison after penning 'threatening' rap lyrics against ex-wife and posting them to Facebook .

But if the reports of one terrified walker are to be believed, the residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells could have a giant Bigfoot-like creature in their midst. A man walking in the woods beside the town's common claims to have spotted an 8ft tall beast with demonic red eyes and long arms. According to The Sun, the ape-like creature, which looked like America's legendary Bigfoot, roared at the walker, who immediately ran off in fear. Over the past six months there have been a number of sightings of a mysterious beast. Locals in the Kent town have mixed opinions about the claims - with some believing it could be a joker wearing a fancy dress costume. Sightings in the town go back decades. The Kentish Apeman was first spotted on the town's common during World War Two 70 years ago. A man called 'Graham S' told a story of how an elderly couple saw it in 1942. Writing for the community website Tunbridge Wells People, he said: 'They were siting on a bench when they became aware of a shuffling noise behind them. 'Upon turning around they saw a tall, ape-like creature with eyes that were burning red moving slowly towards them. They both fled - terrified.'

Two years ago, her social anxiety got so bad she stopped answering questions at school and after her work suffered she began seeing a counsellor. She says she became self-conscious at a very young age which developed into a fear of public speaking, even to the point where she struggled to ask for a ticket at the cinema. Emma said: ‘I wouldn't leave the house without putting on a full face of makeup and I even panicked at answering my phone. ‘When a teacher asked me a question in class I used to go bright red and start shaking all over. ‘When I would go to the cinema I even found it hard to ask for a ticket.

"It sounds like a dessert, is as small as a credit card, and could inspire the next Mark Zuckerberg. The creators of the £22 Raspberry Pi computer, which launched yesterday, hope it will encourage children to design their own apps. But the first task for the next generation of Zuckerbergs and Bill Gateses could be to build a new website for the product, after the current page crashed under the weight of demand. The tiny £22 Raspberry Pi computer includes a wi-fi connection to access the internet, can connect to other gadgets such as cameras, and is even capable of running basic 3D games . Technology teach in.jpg . The gadget looks rather odd next to . sleek modern offerings such as the iPad, and appears to have more in . common with the crystal radio sets of the 1950s. Pugh.jpg . However, the machine is a . fully-fledged computer and can be connected to a monitor, keyboard and . mouse, as well as speakers and printers. Robert Mullins, co-founder of the . Cambridge-based Raspberry Pi Foundation, said: ‘The primary goal was to . build a low-cost computer that every child could own, and one where . programming was the natural thing to do with it.’ The launch follows criticism of technology teaching in the UK. Typically, this has focused on how to use a computer, rather than how to create hardware or software. Last August the chairman of Google, . Eric Schmidt, said the lack of proper computer science lessons in . schools was hindering Britain’s chances of success in the ‘digital media . economy’. His call for the UK to reignite . children’s passion for science, engineering and maths was seized upon by . Education Secretary Michael  Gove, who wants computer teaching to place . greater emphasis on skills such as programming. In a recent speech, Mr . Gove said ‘initiatives like the Raspberry Pi scheme will give children . the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of programming’. He added that the gadget was ‘a great example of the cutting edge of education technology happening right here in the UK’. Another of the Pi’s creators, Eben . Upton, said academics and technology experts decided to pursue the . project after seeing the number of computer science students fall. ‘It has been six years in the making,’ he said. ‘The number of things that had to go right for this to happen . is enormous. I couldn’t be more pleased.’ In the long term, Dr Upton hopes the device will help create an additional 1,000 computer engineers in the UK each year. The foundation had intended to build . the device in Britain. However, after finding that it would not be able . to do this and keep the price at £22, it opted to use factories in . China. The organisation has formed a . partnership with two UK distributors, Premier Farnell and RS Components, . which should be able to increase production quickly to meet demand. Dr Upton said the popularity of the Pi . – and the resulting pressure on its website – were positive signs. ‘We . didn’t realise how successful this was going to be,’ he said. ‘Now we . can concentrate on teaching people to program.’","Credit-card sized wi-fi gizmo designed to teach programming skills .

"The frontline RAF Tornado squadron spearheading Britain’s air strikes on jihadist fighters in Iraq was saved from government defence cuts last night – for at least a year. In a surprise visit to Cyprus, David Cameron announced that 102-year old No II Squadron, which had been due to be disbanded in April, would be reprieved. Two more Tornado GR4 fighter bombers were also being sent to Cyprus as the UK intensified operations against Islamic State targets in Iraq. With six Tornados flying daily sorties focused on IS fighters and their military hardware, the Prime Minister told air crews and troops at the giant RAF base at Akrotiri in Cyprus: ‘We want to make sure that we can keep up this tempo in the days ahead.’ Scroll down for video . Flying visit: David Cameron has announced that two more RAF Tornado bombers will join the campaign against Islamic State militants as he made a surprise visit to the Cyprus base the planes are flying from . Vow: The Prime Minister, arriving at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, also promised that the squadron which has spearheaded Britain’s air strikes on jihadist fighters would be saved from government defence cuts for a year . Mr Cameron visited Cyprus as Turkey’s parliament approved a motion that gives its government new powers to launch military incursions into Iraq and Syria and to allow foreign forces to use its territory for possible operations against the Islamic State group. Its parliament voted 298-98 in favour of the motion which sets the legal framework for any Turkish military involvement, and for the potential use of Turkish bases by foreign troops. Mr Cameron said he had visited Cyprus to hear directly from service men and women about ‘their operations, the challenges they face and what support they need.’ He announced the two additional Tornados being sent to the base and confirmed: ‘We will also extend the lifetime of Number Two Squadron for a further year to April 2016 to ensure we can sustain this effort in the months ahead.’ But critics of the cuts that have seen RAF fast jet squadrons reduced from 33 at the time of the first Gulf War to seven, said the original decision to axe II Squadron had been ‘disgraceful’ and the U-turn was a sign of the chaos within Ministry of Defence planning. Reprieve: Mr Cameron said that the 102-year old squadron, which was due to be disbanded in March, would be reprieved until April 2016 as the UK intensified operations against Islamic State targets . Meeting: Mr Cameron meets pilots, engineers and logistic support staff in front of a Tornado GR4 at RAF Akrotiri . The Tornados, which are more than 30 years old, were to have been replaced by state of the art Typhoons but incredibly they cannot match the weapons capability currently of the older plane – a capability needed for what Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has warned could be a three years operation against IS. Missions over Iraq require the RAF to attack small mobile targets such as trucks and even motorcycles and the Tornado, carrying the Brimstone missile, is suited to this while it will take three years before the Typhoon is fully operational with it. Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, said : ‘This illustrates the chaos in Ministry of Defence planning. ‘The RAF has been squeezed and squeezed and squeezed and now they have found we have reached the bottom of the barrel.’ He added : ‘If II (AC) Squadron is going to be spared, it makes sense. It would have been utter folly to get rid of the unit at a time when tasking is increasing by leaps and bounds. ‘Even though it will have a knock-on effect and create a bit of turmoil, for instance air crews will have already been told their new postings, this is a sensible course of action. ‘The Typhoons don’t have the capabilities to carry out the same role. To suggest they do is pie-in-the-sky. Flying high: The Tornado aircraft was also due to be withdrawn from service next year, but its operational lifespan will now be extended until 2016 . Grateful: Mr Cameron said he wanted to thank the armed forces for the work they were doing to 'defeat these barbaric Isil terrorists' Air Chief Marshall Sir Michael Graydon, the former head of the RAF, said: ‘The decision to cut the Tornado squadron was pretty disgraceful so I’m delighted if this has been reversed. It is the most sensible thing I’ve heard in a long time. ‘With Tornados, doing commitments in Afghanistan, Iraq and against jihadists in Nigeria, it just didn’t add up to cut one of the squadrons. It would have really put Britain’s ability to sustain operations at risk. ‘The cuts were not done on any sensible or logical basis. It was a case of the Government saying, “Let’s take a risk on what capabilities we’ll need” and that risk has caught up with us.’ Last week, Air Chief Marshall Sir Michael : ‘The lack of combat aircraft is a major weakness.’ The UK only has three Tornado squadrons – two assigned to Afghanistan – and II Squadron, from RAF Marham, Norfolk, have played a pivotal role in the UK’s contribution to the US-led coalition’s operations against IS. Mr Cameron was forced to delay scrapping two Tornado squadrons at the time of the air campaign over Libya in 2011. The two-seater Tornado carries a variety of fire power that includes Paveway 500lb, 1,000lb and 2,000lb bombs to target small compounds, Storm Shadow bunker busters and supersonic Brimstone missiles that can hit moving targets such as enemy fighters in cars or on motorbikes. Pressure: The Prime Minister said RAF jets had taken part in a dozen sorties, and had carried out strikes on four of those missions - hitting eight targets and helping push back Islamic State militants . It currently forms the backbone of the RAF’s ground attack capability so it is seen as ‘ideal’ for operations against IS. IS is said to be stopping large convoys of motorbikes, reducing the number of checkpoints and banning fighters from using Twitter because it could identify locations, exposing them to attack by the Tornado. Operating from the giant RAF Akrotiri, the Tornados have been hunting down moving IS targets over northern Iraq having switched from its earlier reconnaissance and surveillance operations.. Defence chiefs had planned II Squadron would be reformed with Typhoon aircraft and based in RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland. The squadron dates back to 1912 and has a proud history that includes supporting troops in the trenches in World War 1, overflying the D-Day beaches at low level, both Gulf Wars, the Balkans, Libya and Afghanistan. It is expected to take another three years before the Typhoon has been cleared to fire Brimstone and all the full weapons payload that the Tornado, which is due to leave service in 2019, can currently deliver. Britain currently has just seven combat-capable air squadrons, compared to 15 for the French air force.","Prime Minister makes a surprise visit to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus .

"The strongest indication yet that Apple's new iPhone 5S will have a fingerprint scanner has been discovered by an app developer. A string of code discovered in the latest beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software implies that either the iPhone 5S or iPhone 6 could come with a fingerprint scanner. The code describes a user touching the Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 'recognition is complete'. A folder called Biometric Kit was also found. A string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software, pictured, gives the strongest indication to date that either the iPhone 5S or the iPhone 6 could have a fingerprint scanner . A folder called Biometric Kit, pictured, was also found and the feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone, or to authorise payments in the App Store and prevent people from stealing your phone, reading your messages or obtaining personal data . Rumours about a fingerprint scanner emerged before the . iPhone 5 was released in September last year. Apple had purchased security company . AuthenTec, which analysts claimed was because it wanted the firm's . expertise in biometric technologies. The iPhone 5 did not include the . technology, though, and this lead people to speculate that the next . model - dubbed iPhone 5S - or later versions, such as iPhone 6, would . include the feature. In April this year, rumours surfaced that the next iPhone model could be delayed because of this technology. A supply chain source in Taiwan told Reuters Apple was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with . the fingerprint sensor, and this may be causing production problems. Earlier this month a Chinese source claimed the date could even be pushed back to October. The feature could be for security reasons . to unlock the phone, or to authorise payments in the App Store and . prevent people from stealing your phone, reading your messages or . obtaining personal data. The screenshots were tweeted by developer Hamza Sood. Rumours about a fingerprint scanner being introduced to an upcoming Apple handset first emerged before the iPhone 5 was released in September last year. Apple had purchased security company AuthenTec, which analysts claimed was because Apple wanted the firm's expertise in NFC (near field communication) and biometric secutiry technologies. The iPhone 5 did not include the feature, though, and this led people to speculate that the next model - dubbed iPhone 5S - or later versions, such as iPhone 6, would include the feature. In April this year, rumours surfaced that the next iPhone model could be delayed because of this technology. A supply chain source in Taiwan told Reuters that Apple was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with . the fingerprint sensor, and this may be causing production problems. Then in May, PayPal's chief information security officer Michael Barrett claimed fingerprint scanners could spell the end of modern-day passwords and the technology would become more popular once Apple introduces it to one of its products.

A supply chain source in Taiwan told Reuters that Apple was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with the fingerprint sensor, and this may be causing production problems . Motorola already uses fingerprint sensors on its Atrix 4G model, released in in 2011 and this feature is used in place of a password or PIN lock. Some laptops, including the Lenovo ThinkPad T430 comes with a fingerprint reader built-in. Other handsets, including Samsung's Galaxy S3 and S4, that run Android additionally have the option of enabling Face Unlock - a feature that uses facial recognition to unlock the phone. An update to the feature recently added a 'Live' element that required a person to blink, to prove they were real and it wasn't a photo being held up to the camera. Commenting on the news, Andy Kemshall, co-founder and technical director at SecurEnvoy said: 'Biometric authentication is not yet near the level it needs to be for the majority of consumer facing organisations to implement it in their products. 'Fingerprint scanning, eyeball scanning, voice and face recognition are all at least a decade away from being reliable enough to use as authentication methods. 'Using technology already owned by the individual, rather than a body part, such as SMS authentication through mobile phones, is a more secure and cost effective method for organisations creating new products. 'It has a 99.9 per cent reliability rate if passcodes are preloaded and is far less prone to faults so less risk of unwanted users trying to access an individual’s details.'

This feature is used in place of a password or PIN lock . Various rumours have suggested that the new iPhone will be released on 6 September, 10 September and even October. The name has not been confirmed, but it has been dubbed the iPhone 5S following suit with Apple's iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S release schedule. Other features expected in the next Apple model include a faster A7 processor, improved Siri voice recognition, including Siri in the Car, as well as an improved camera. A larger iPhone 6 is then expected in 2014, and Apple is also rumoured to be working on a budget model. This cheaper handset is expected to come in different colours and be made of plastic. It could cost as little as £63. YouTube user DetroitBORG recently posted video that appears to be the first hands-on look at this rumoured plastic casing.

"U.S. President Barack Obama was personally informed of phone tapping against German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which may have begun as early as 2002, according to German media. As the damaging espionage scandal widened, Bild am Sonntag newspaper quoted U.S. intelligence sources as saying that National Security Agency chief Keith Alexander had briefed Obama on the operation against Merkel in 2010. 'Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue,' the newspaper quoted a high-ranking NSA official as saying. Scroll down for video . Unhappy: Merkel suggested at an EU gathering that she was not placated by talks with President Obama . News weekly Der Spiegel reported that leaked NSA documents showed that Merkel's phone had appeared on a list of spying targets since 2002, and was still under surveillance weeks before Obama visited Berlin in June. As a sense of betrayal spread in many world capitals allegedly targeted by the NSA, European leaders are calling for a new deal with Washington on intelligence gathering that would maintain an essential alliance while keeping the fight against terrorism on track. Germany will send its own spy chiefs to Washington soon to demand answers. Meanwhile several thousand protesters gathered in Washington Saturday to push for new U.S. legislation to curb the NSA's activities. Swiss president Ueli Maurer warned that the scandal risked 'undermining confidence between states'. 'We don't know if we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg or if other governments are acting in the same ruthless manner,' he told the Schweiz am Sonntag weekly. Anger: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and Brazil's Dilma Rousseff (right) have both voiced concerns over the NSA's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners . Merkel confronted Obama with the snooping allegations in a phone call on Wednesday saying that such spying would be a 'breach of trust' between international partners. The suspicion also prompted Berlin to summon the U.S. ambassador - a highly unusual move between the close allies. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported without citing its sources that Obama had told Merkel during their call that he had been unaware of any spying against her. Der Spiegel said he told her that if he had been informed of the operation he would have stopped it at once. Other media reports said that Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice had also told German officials the president knew nothing of the spying. Merkel's office declined to comment on what he told her during their conversation. The White House has said it is not . monitoring Merkel's phone calls and will not do so in future, but it has . refused to say whether it did previously. Bild . am Sonntag said that Obama wanted to be informed in detail about . Merkel, who has played a decisive role in the eurozone debt crisis and . is widely seen as Europe's most powerful leader. Demands: Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, . left, speaks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, right, yesterday during a . round-table meeting at an European Union summit in Brussels . Under fire: President Barack Obama, standing next to Vice President Joe Biden, speaks in the White House yesterday . German Chancellor Angela Merkel checking her mobile phone in May 2012 . As a result, the report said, the NSA stepped up its surveillance of her communications, targeting not only the mobile phone she uses to conduct business for her conservative Christian Democratic Union party but also her encrypted official device. Merkel only acquired the latter handset over the summer. Bild said U.S. intelligence specialists were then able to monitor the content of her conversations as well as text messages, which Merkel sends by the dozen each day to key associates. Only the specially secured land line in her office was out of the reach of the NSA, which sent the intelligence gathered straight to the White House bypassing the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, according to the report. Bild and Spiegel described a hive of spy activity on the fourth floor of the US embassy in central Berlin, a stone's throw from the government quarter, from which the United States kept tabs on Merkel and other German officials. Spiegel cited a classified 2010 document indicating that U.S. intelligence had 80 high-tech surveillance offices worldwide in cities including Paris, Madrid, Rome, Prague, Geneva and Frankfurt. If the spying against Merkel began in 2002, it would mean the United States under then president George W. Bush targeted her while she was still the country's chief opposition leader, three years before she became chancellor. Bild said Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder was also in the NSA's sights because of his vocal opposition to the US invasion of Iraq and close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. As anger simmered in Berlin, Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich sharpened his tone. 'Surveillance is a crime and those responsible must be brought to justice,' he told Bild. A poll for the newspaper found that 76 percent of Germans believe Obama should apologise for the alleged spying on Merkel, and 60 percent said the scandal had damaged German-U.S. ties. The scandal derived from documents acquired from U.S. fugitive defence contractor Edward Snowden by Spiegel. The Social Democrats' chief whip Thomas Oppermann told Bild that German MPs would now like to question Snowden. 'Snowden's accounts seem credible while the U.S. government apparently lied to us about this matter.'","Obama was personally informed the U.S. was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel, German media reports .

"The Frenchman murdered alongside three members of a British-Iraqi family in the Alps had been involved in a 'bitter dispute' over a million pounds plus inheritance, it emerged today. Sylvain Mollier, 45, was the lone cyclist whose dead body was found lying next to a BMW saloon close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France, on September 5th. He was shot seven times, while the other victims were shot twice: Said Al-Hilli, a 50-year-old engineer from Claygate, Surrey, was killed inside the car with his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila, 74. Murder scene: Investigators examine the car in which Said Al-Hilli was killed along with with his wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74 . Now it has emerged that Mr Mollier was involved in family arguments caused by having a baby with a wealthy heiress sixteen years his junior. Claire Schutz, the 29-year-old who shared a home with Mr Mollier, gave birth to Louis, their first child together, in June. Just a few months before she gave birth, Claire was given a hugely lucrative business by her parents, making her a millionaire. Court documents from October 2011 confirm the handover of the Schutz-Morange Pharmacy, in Grignon, near Annecy, which is valued at a minimum £1.1million. The couple had been living together for around a year by this time and Claire would have been pregnant with Louis, yet she describes herself as a 'a spinster not signed up to a civil partnership'. Despite this, Mr Mollier started to receive large amounts of cash from Claire — a development which did not go down well with her side of the family. Just . before his death, Mr Mollier had also won the legal right to take three . years off from the factory where he worked to look after Louis, and his . two teenage sons from his first marriage. The Schutz family have been receiving advice from controversial politician Pierre Morange, left.  Saad Al-Hilli, 50, right, was shot twice by the gunman, but cyclist Sylvain Mollier was shot seven times . Mollier was riding a new £4,000 racing bike on the day he was murdered. Ironically, Mollier was following a cycling route suggested to him by Thierry Schutz when he was killed, although police sources say he had deviated from that route into the forest lay-by. 'Sylvain's relationship with Claire was of growing concern to her side of the family and especially her parents,' said a senior figure on the Grignon local council, where Thierry Schutz served as a councillor for two years. 'Sylvain came from a down-to-earth family . but had growing claims on Claire's fortune. This was something Claire's . family was not happy about. 'They were particularly concerned . about Sylvain's spending. There was a bitter dispute over what was going . on and this got worse when Sylvain took three years off to effectively . live off Claire's money.' Speaking . about the handover of the pharmacy, Mollier's brother Christophe told . The Sunday Times: 'Sylvain had been through a difficult divorce and had a . lot of financial commitments so naturally was very happy with the . development. However, there were serious frictions between the Molliers . and Claire Schutz's family.' Claire Schutz, 29, who lived with Mr Mollier, gave birth to Louis, their first child together, just four months before the Frenchman was killed near Lake Annecy, pictured . The Schutz family, who now refuse to speak about the murders, have been receiving advice from Pierre Morange, the brother of Genevieve Morange. A political ally of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, he is the MP and town mayor for Chambourcy, near Paris. Morange found himself drawn into another high-profile murder case five years ago when Christian Marichal, the chief of police in Chambourcy, was found stabbed to death at his home. The murder came shortly after both men had been accused of corruption, allegations they both denied. A year later, Morange, who said he feared for his life after Marichal's murder, was granted a special permit to carry a handgun. Mr Morange declined to comment on the latest killings. Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor leading the investigation, confirmed he was aware of the tensions between the families, but added 'they were not something I particularly wanted to make public. The family is entitled to their private life.' The Al-Hillis' two daughters survived the attack — the youngest, Zeena, 4, by hiding beneath her mother's body; the eldest, Zainab, 7, despite injuries from being shot in the shoulder and 'pistol whipped'.","Sylvain Mollier was shot a total of seven times; other victims were shot twice .

"From skyscrapers and bridges to markets and houses, modern buildings can transform the skyline and mood of a city. And in order to create new landmarks and public forums, structural engineers have to marry cutting-edge architectural design and making a building stand up. Now, some of the best new structures around the world – from a new Apple store in Istanbul to a bridge modelled on a Maori fishhook – have been shortlisted for The Structural Awards 2014. Some of the best new structures around the world - from a new Apple store in Istanbul to a bridge modelled on a Maori fishhook - have been shortlisted for The Structural Awards 2014. This is the new Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London . The prestigious competition, run by The Institution of Structural Engineers in London, celebrates innovative designs and materials in all types of buildings and structures. Shortlisted structures include everything from wood-clad eco houses to metallic futuristic market places, shops that look like glass cuboids, bridges with opening parts and a bulbous stock exchange that appears to defy gravity. Certain projects, such as a footbridge in the Rocky Mountains, Canada, had not only to fit into a beautiful location, but to add to the landscape.

The judges of the competition noted that not only is it practical, but it ‘respects the beautiful natural setting’. Some projects shoehorned incredibly modern features such as dramatic metal staircases, into classical older buildings. There are only five elements to this new Apple 'lantern' building - four sheets of glass and a single panel of metal. The only thing holding them together is silicone.'Only engineering excellence and attention to detail can produce a result of such simplicity and purity of expression,' the judges said . The Lower Hatea Crossing (pictured) is part of a plan to reduce traffic congestion around the city of Whangarei, New Zealand. The architectural appearance was inspired by a traditional Maori fish hook.The judges said: 'The client aspired for the bridge to be a public landmark that would reflect the art and culture of the Maori people. The innovative design of the bridge has delivered that aspiration.' And other shortlisted entries pushed the boundaries when it came to the use of materials. Engineers from Arup designed the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in Shenzhen, China. It has a 836ft (255metre) high tower that supports a three storey ‘podium’ 118ft (36 metres) above ground level. The effect is dramatic and also includes a glass façade that changes appearance in different lighting conditions. Entries came from New Zealand, Turkey, China, Germany, Canada, as well as many from the UK and the winners will be announced in London on November 14, 2014. The 738ft (255metre) high tower of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China supports a large three-storey podium 118ft (36metre) above ground level. A textured all-glass facade enables the building to sparkle and change appearance according to the lighting conditions . Red Bridge House is set within a remote area of ancient woodland in East Sussex. The vision was to create a bespoke three-storey residential structure, worthy of its unique setting. The judges said: 'Elegant design and detailing combine to give this daringly-conceived project a light, open feeling. The outcome is a delightful residence' Slipstream (pictured) is a giant sculpture in the new Heathrow Terminal 2 building, expressing the movement of a stunt plane flying through the entrance space. It is the longest permanent sculpture in Europe, made from around 32,000 unique parts. The judges said: 'It is a great example of creative art and engineering coming together.' ‘We hold the Structural Awards each year to recognise outstanding work by structural engineers and to raise awareness about the vital global role they play creating innovative design solutions,’ said Martin Powell, Chief Executive of The Institution of Structural Engineers. ‘From skyscraper and bridge construction to heritage and home projects, the awards showcase the full range of chartered structural engineers’ abilities - as trusted professionals, problem solvers, and the guardians of public safety.’ A new market building (pictured) built on a site surrounded by some of Barcelona's busiest transport lanes. The roof was assembled at ground level and jacked up into position . The new bridge at Schönebeck, Germany, (pictured) is the largest cable-stayed bridge in the region, constructed to relieve the City of Schönebeck from a considerable increase of through traffic.  The judges were impressed by the elegant simplicity of the bridge, which has been thoughtfully detailed to fit perfectly into the surrounding landscape . The Kew House project  (pictured) brings a refreshingly different and highly-engineered approach to the archetypal problem of creating attractive, useable space on a tightly-constrained site, the judges said .","Winners of The Structural Awards 2014 will be announced in London on November 14 .

"Weather experts have been baffled by a black ring which appeared in the sky above Leamington Spa on Friday evening. Schoolgirl Georgina Heap was playing tennis with her mother Jo Heap when she looked up at the sky near Warwick castle and saw a mysterious black ring. She photographed the circle on her iPhone but so far, no one can explain the origin of the strange black mark. Scroll down for video . Georgina Heap, 16, took the photograph on her iPhone on Friday evening. The ring was seen in the sky above Leamington Spa, near Warwick castle . The ring remained in the sky for around three minutes before disappearing completely. The circle resembles a giant smoke ring but Warwickshire Fire and Rescue service said that there had been no reports of fire at the time of the sighting. The Met Office said that the ring did not appear to be weather-related. Nick Pope, an expert on UFOs and a previous government adviser on unexplained phenomena, said he believed the circle to be 'organic'. He said: 'It's a truly bizarre image. It looks like a smoke ring, but I can't see where it could have come from. 'Other alternatives would include some sort of unusual meteorological phenomenon. 'One . other possibility is that the shape is made up of millions of bees or . other insects, but I've never heard of insects behaving in this way . before, so if this is the explanation, it's a real-life X-File.'

"It is a spectacular sight: a Spitfire, the famed RAF warplane which won the Battle of Britain, swooping in mid-air. Alongside it, another iconic British military aircraft - the revolutionary harrier jump jet that helped defeat Argentina in the Falklands War in 1982. And nearby two fearsome, and notorious, weapons used by Nazi Germany to bring death and destruction to the streets of London and the south-east during the last days of the Second World War – the V-1 ‘doodlebug’ flying bomb and the V-2 rocket.

It was one of many used to mark temporary graves during the war, which saw millions killed . The military hardware, used to devastating effect in conflicts during the last 100 years, are the centrepieces of the Imperial War Museum after a £40million transformation. Along with a T-34 tank and a Reuters news agency Land Rover destroyed by rocket fire in Gaza, there are nine objects suspended or positioned in the dramatic new central atrium to correspond with displays on different floors. The museum, which puts the stories of human conflict at its heart, tells the history of the last century of war. Tomorrow the Duke of Cambridge will reopen London’s Imperial War Museum and unveil its spectacular new First World War Galleries, supported by the Daily Mail and the generosity of its army of readers. Prince William will be accompanied by Viscount Rothermere, the publisher of the Mail and the chairman of the IWM Foundation. It will reopen to the public on Saturday. The museum, which has been completely closed for the last six months, has been overhauled to coincide with the centenary of the Great War, which left almost a million British soldiers dead. A young girl is silhouetted against a First World War image of the inside of a make-shift trench on the frontline at the 'World War Galleries' exhibit. The new exhibit coincides with the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict . Barely a family up and down the country was untouched by tragedy during the conflict of 1914-18, when men left their homes for the horror of the trenches to defeat Kaiser Wilhelm II's troops. The new First World War galleries are three times the size of the old ones and house 1,300 objects, including weapons and uniforms. They will explain why and how men from across the globe marched off to war – millions never returning. But many visitors will find the small, personal objects most moving, for instance diaries, letters and the wallet of a soldier killed in battle which holds faded photos of his wife and children. Visitors to the newly refurbished Imperial War Museum can look at exhibits such as these which show the different uniforms, including a British uniform, left, and a French uniform, right, worn by servicemen during the conflict. Diane Lees, Director-General of IWM, hopes the experience will help visitors learn 'the terrible strain the war placed on people and communities' Multimedia displays capture the vast tragedy of the Battle of the Somme, which saw 20,000 British soldiers killed in one day. Visitors can walk into a ‘trench’ with images of life on the frontline beamed onto walls surrounding them – taking them on a journey back 100 years. But the museum will also tell the story of warfare over the last century – including the Second World War, the Falklands and the so-called ‘War on Terror’ which began at the beginning of the 21st Century. Hundreds of new objects have been added to the displays including the including a piece of the World Trade Center destroyed in the 9/11 terror attacks, a Desert Hawk drone and the suitcase of a Jewish couple who died in Auschwitz. Director-general Diane Lees said: ‘The atrium will have a major ‘wow’ factor. It’s a beautiful space, really cathedral-like. ‘Each of the objects on display will give a voice to the people who created them, used them or cared for them and reveal stories not only of destruction, suffering and loss, but also endurance, innovation, duty and devotion, comradeship and love.’ Imperial War Museum staff look over one of the new exhibits - a First World War officer's glove, which was shrunk by poison gas.

A young woman looks at an audio visual display in the new First World War Gallery. The aim of the new permanent display is to tell the story of the conflict through the eyes of people in Britain and its empire . The museum was founded in 1917, as the war still raged, to preserve the stories of those who fought and died. Records show that the largest personal donations were £1,000 from Lord Rothermere, co-founder of the Daily Mail, and £500 from the soap magnate Sir William Lever. The first Lord Rothermere, who lost two of his three sons in the Great War, donated the museum site to the nation in 1930.

"An 85-year-old U.S. tourist detained in North Korea for six weeks for alleged 'war crimes' has landed back in San Francisco after catching a flight from Beijing. North Korean state media said Saturday that Merrill Newman, a war veteran, was released because he had apologized for his alleged crimes during the Korean War and because of his age and medical condition. Speaking after arriving at San Francisco International Airport, Mr Newman said he was glad to be back home and thanked U.S. and Swedish diplomats who worked to secure his release. 'I'd like to thank the Swedish Embassy  and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. It was a great homecoming! I'm tired, pleased to be with my family. Thank you for all the support we've had.' Scroll down for video . Great to be back home: 85 year-old retired U.S. veteran, Merrill E. Newman, who was detained for over a month in North Korea, smiles as he arrives at San Francisco International Airport . Happy just to be with you:Newman was deported after being detained over his role in special forces operations in the Korean War six decades ago . Beaming:  Merrill Newman walked past a cavalcade of reporters. He said it felt good to be back home and was looking forward to seeing his family and getting some rest . U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who is . traveling in Seoul, welcomed the release and said he talked by phone . with Newman in Beijing, offering him a ride home on Air Force Two. Biden . said Newman declined because of a direct flight to his home state of . California, which he took later Saturday. Newman's . son, Jeffrey, said he spoke briefly with his father from Beijing and . that he was 'in excellent spirits and eager to be reunited with his . family.' 'As you can . imagine this has been a very difficult ordeal for us as a family, and . particularly for him,' he said in a statement read outside his home in . Pasadena, adding that they will say more about this unusual journey . after Newman has rested. Back with his family: Merrill Newman speaks beside his wife Lee after arriving at San Francisco Newman was detained in North Korea late October at the end of a 10-day trip to North Korea . Together again: Merrill Newman, left, walks beside his wife Lee and son Jeffrey after arriving back home. His trip to North Korea came six decades after he oversaw a group of South Korean wartime guerrillas during the 1950-53 war . The smiles say it all: 'It's been a great homecoming', said Mr Newman, who was wearing a blue sport coat and khakis. He thanked the U.S. and Swedish diplomats who had helped secure his release . He's free!: Veteran U.S. soldier Merrill Newman (C), who was detained for over a month in North Korea, arrives Saturday at Beijing airport . Last . month, Newman read from an awkwardly worded alleged confession that . apologized for, among other things, killing North Koreans during the . war. They were his first words since being taken off a plane October 26 by . North Korean authorities while preparing to leave the country after a . 10-day tour. Analysts questioned whether the statement was coerced, and . former South Korean guerrillas who had worked with Newman and fought . behind enemy lines during the war disputed some of the details. Newman's . detention highlights the extreme sensitivity with which Pyongyang views . the 1950-53 war, which ended without a formal peace treaty, leaving the . Korean Peninsula sill technically in a state of war. The conflict is a . regular focus of North Korean propaganda and media, which accuse . Pyongyang's wartime enemies Washington and Seoul of carrying on the . fighting by continuing to push for the North's overthrow. Propaganda reel: Newman reading a written apology for his alleged crimes both as a tourist and during his participation in the Korean War, while under detention . 'In . the United States, we revealingly refer to the Korean War as the . `forgotten war.' Most Americans do not realize that memory of the war's . violence is at the foundation of North Korean national identity,' said . Christine Hong, an Asia specialist at the University of California at . Santa Cruz who has twice visited North Korea. Tension . remains on the Korean Peninsula, though Pyongyang's angry rhetoric . against the U.S. and South Korea has toned down compared with its . torrent of springtime threats to launch nuclear strikes and restart . nuclear bomb fuel production. State . Department spokeswoman Marie Harf urged Pyongyang to pardon 'as a . humanitarian gesture' another American, Kenneth Bae, who has been held . in the North for more than a year. Members . of the former South Korean guerrilla group said in an interview last . week with The Associated Press that Newman was their adviser. Some have . expressed surprise that Newman would take the risk of visiting North . Korea given his association with their group, which is still remembered . with keen hatred in the North. Others were amazed Pyongyang still . considered Newman a threat. 'Why . did North Korea make such a big fuss?' Park Chan-wu, a former guerrilla . who worked with Newman during the war, said Saturday. 'It's been 60 . years since he worked as our adviser.' The . televised statement read last month by Newman said he was attempting to . meet surviving guerrilla fighters he had trained during the conflict so . he could reconnect them with their wartime colleagues living in South . Korea, and that he had criticized the North during his recent trip. Back in the day: Merrill Edward Newman (bottom row, 4th L) poses for a group photo with some members of the Kuwol Guerrilla Unit (top row) in this photo taken September 1953 . Newman's . political value had 'expired' for North Korea, said Chang Yong Seok, a . senior researcher at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and . Unification Studies. Newman's written apology and the TV broadcast were . enough for Pyongyang to show outsiders that it has maintained its . dignity - something the proud country views as paramount, said Chang. There was relief in Newman's home state of California. 'He's . a genuine and generous man, and we're all so relieved that he's coming . home,' said Dan Haifley, executive director of O'Neill Sea Odyssey, an . ocean exploration program in Santa Cruz that the Newmans have supported. Jeffrey . Newman has previously said that his father, an avid traveler and . retired finance executive from California, had always wanted to return . to the country where he fought during the Korean War. Before . Newman, North Korea detained at least six Americans since 2009. Five of . them have been either released or deported after prominent Americans . like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter travelled to . Pyongyang.

"A filmmaker has created a nailbiting video of a group of daredevils attempting to tightrope walk between two hot-air balloons. Filmmaker Sébastien Montaz-Rosset shot the exploits of a group of French adventurers who call themselves Skyliners as they attempted the death-defying feat. The group strung up a line between two hot-air balloons then launched them high into the skies before attempting to walk across the tightrope. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Motley crew: The Skyliners prepare for their latest adventure . Lift-off: The two balloons, joined by a tightrope, begin to rise . Basket case: The French daredevils take the balloons higher and higher . None of the walkers managed to make it all the way across the line before falling. Many were wearing small cameras on their heads to capture first-person footage of the exhilarating stunt. None of the footage shows the tightrope walkers drifting to the ground on parachutes, but presumably that's what the tiny packs on their backs contain. Three's a crowd: A third balloon of observers watches the two joined ones . High rise: The first tightroper edges out into the open air . Fine line: The rope looks slack and the walker has difficulty keeping his balance as he is buffeted by the wind . Skyliners describe themselves as 'a group of flying Frenchies,' whose passions are 'highlining, basejumping, mountaineering and much more.'Montaz-Rosset, whose childhood in the French Alps fueled his passion for the outdoors and sports, has been following and filming the group for several years and recently released a film about them.Entitled, I Believe I Can Fly (Flight of the Frenchies) is about Skyliners Tancrède and Julien who pioneered 'highlining,' a vertiginous combination of climbing, slackline and tightrope walking. The fall: The walker loses his balance, holding the rope briefly before falling to the ground . Vertigo: A camera on this walker's head shows exactly what he can see . Wobbly: It's incredible the Skyliners can take any steps at all . Free falling: The walker loses his balance and falls to the cheers of his team . While none of the Skyliners were successful in their first hot-air balloon tightroping bid, the crew intend to make another attempt within days.THe hot-air balloon is the oldest successful human-carrying flight technology.

"A U.S. Marine is presumed lost at sea after bailing out from a MV-22 Osprey plane after it lost power over the Persian Gulf on Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced today . The tilt-rotor aircraft - which can take off and land like a helicopter, but fly like a fixed-wig plane - had just taken off from the amphibious assault ship U.S.S. Makin Island when it suddenly lost power. Two crew members bailed out, but the pilot stayed on board and was able to save the $70million aircraft and land it again on the deck of the ship. Numerous ships from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Navy's Fifth Fleet scoured the area in search of the crew members. An MV-22 Osprey plane (like the one pictured right) lost power while taking off from the U.S.S. Makin Island assault ship (pictured) on Wednesday (stock image) One Marine was rescued and is recovering aboard a Navy ship. The other was not found. The service member has not been identified. The Makin Island - which can carry Harrier jets, an assortment of helicopters, up to 22 Osprey planes and nearly 2,000 Marines - is currently stationed in Bahrain to support military operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Bahrain is home to the Navy's Fifth Fleet. The San Diego-based warship left for the Middle East on July 25. It carried elements of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which is also based in San Diego. The MV-22 (like the one pictured here) is a title-rotor aircraft capable of taking off and landing like a helicopter, but can fly like an airplane . The V-22 is a small, fast transport plane that is able to fly and maneuver like an airplane, but can take off and land on ship decks and makeshift landing pads like a helicopter. Each plane can carry up to 36 troops or a small, specially designed fighting Growler vehicle. Its $35billion development, long delayed and far over-budget, came at the cost of several deadly crashes. More recently, though, the aircraft has had a slightly better record. Two crashes in 2012, however, raised questions. One on a training exercise in Morocco killed two Marines. In another, the aircraft flipped over at a Florida air base and injured all five aboard.","Two Marines bailed out of V-22 when it lost power as it was taking off from the USS Makin Island in the Persian Gulf Wednesday .

"Using moves that would make any rock climber jealous, these death-defying goats expertly make their way up an almost vertical dam.

Head for heights: These incredible pictures show the moment a herd of sure-footed mountain goats climbed up an almost vertical dam in search of salt . Determined: Photographer Paolo Seimandi, 34, captured the stunning moment a herd of alpine ibexes climbed up a dam in Gran Paradiso National Park in Northern Italy . The gravity-defying goats typically live in very steep and rocky terrain at altitudes of up to to 4,600m and have no fear of falling whether climbing up or down the dam wall. In the past the alpine ibex was just restricted to the Gran Paradiso National Park and the Maurienne Valley in the French Alps, but in recent years they have been spotted in Germany, Switzerland and Austria as well as Bulgaria and Slovenia. For most of the year, males and females occupy different habitats - females tend to stick to steep terrain and males use lowland meadows. But when snow appears both sexes, which are strictly herbivorous, move to steep rocky slopes to avoid the snow.

"The homeless preacher who kidnapped 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart in 2002 and repeatedly raped her before she was found nine months later has been beaten in prison, it has been reported. Brian David Mitchell, 59, is serving a life sentence without parole in Tuscon, Arizona for the kidnapping of Smart, whom he snatched from her Salt Lake City home at knife point. A prison source has now revealed that Mitchell was attacked by a fellow inmate at the high security lock-up as other prisoners watched and chanted: 'This is for Elizabeth Smart!' The source told the National Enquirer that Mitchell was targeted due to his crime against a child, as well as his arrogance and religious preaching. Scroll down for video . Targeted: Brian David Mitchell, pictured in 2004, has reportedly been beaten by a fellow inmate who grew tired of his arrogance. He is serving a life sentence for kidnapping Elizabeth Smart in 2002 . 'He had a target on his back because . the other inmates hate child molesters,' the source told the Enquirer. 'Even murderers look down on . them as the lowest of the low.' The source said that the inmate . knocked Mitchell to the ground and punched and kicked him 'for several . minutes' while the kidnapper simply curled up and yelled for him to stop. He suffered a swollen eye, bloody lip and cuts and bruises in the attack, and has since been moved to another section of the prison that is made up mostly of sexual offenders. The reports come as Mitchell's former . stepdaughter takes on a fight of her own; she said she is struggling to . get his belongings - including clothes and writings - back from the Salt . Lake City police. Victim: Elizabeth Smart was just 14 when she was kidnapped from her home at knife point. She was held against her will and repeatedly raped until a cyclist recognized her in 2003 and alerted police . Moving on: Smart, now 25, works as a correspondent for NBC and married Matthew Gilmour, pictured, last year . One . officer recently told her that the belongings were given to Mitchell's . niece, but Rebecca Woodridge said her stepfather does not have one, and now . fears the items could be sold for a profit. 'I'll . keep trying until I die,' Woodridge told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'I . won’t give up. I’m not the type to quit, and I don’t give up. But I'm tired, and it’s frustrating.' Woodridge said she maintains regular contact with her former stepfather, who sexually abused her when she was a child. She spoke to him on the phone recently, she said. 'He said he's doing good,' she said. 'That the Lord has been good to him.' Woodridge has long supported her former . stepfather, claiming after his conviction that he had not received a . fair trial and should have been tried out of the state. Battle: Mitchell's former stepdaughter Rebecca Woodridge, pictured after he was convicted in 2010, said she is now fighting the Salt Lake City police to get his belongings back . Outside the court she said she believed he was insane, adding: 'I think he should have been found not guilty and been sent somewhere to find the reason that he does the things he does.' The prosecution had claimed that he was faking his mental illness. Smart was just 14 when she was snatched by Mitchell, a married homeless preacher, and taken to the woods, where he forced her to become his 'second wife'. Since her rescue, Smart, now 25, has spoken out about her ordeal and her almost daily rapes at the hands of her sick captor. 'I remember lying on the floor of that . tent feeling so worthless, crushed. I just didn't feel that I could ever . be worth anything,' she said at a function in April. Through the years: This compilation of images of Brian David Mitchell was released by Smart's family in 2003 when he was wanted for questioning in connection with their daughter's kidnapping . The only thing that helped her stay sane was the memory of her mother's love, she said. 'Because . I found something worth living for, I was able to decide that no matter . what happened, I would survive,' Smart said. 'No matter what I had to . face, I would do it as long as it was within my power. Somehow, I would . see my family again.' Smart was rescued after nine months when a cyclist saw her in Sandy, Utah - about 20 miles from her family's home - with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, and alerted authorities. Police took the kidnappers into custody and Smart was reunited with her parents. As well as touring the country to speak about her ordeal, she is now a contributor to NBC. She married Matthew Gilmour in Hawaii last year.","Brian David Mitchell 'targeted by a fellow inmate in Tuscon, Arizona who was fed up of his arrogance and his religious preaching'

"They say dogs are man's best friend. Now one enterprising clairvoyant has gone one step further - making her dogs her business partners. Linda Lancashire, a grandmother from Derbyshire, says her two poodles can sniff out health, money and relationship problems - before relaying their findings to her. The 59-year-old, who says she counts politicians and Paralympians among her clients, has run her clairvoyant business from her bungalow, named Broomsticks, for more than 40 years and says she has a very long but secret list of celebrity clients. Man's best friend: Linda Lancashire, a psychic grandmother who has read tarot cards for everyone from politicians to paralympians, has a little help from her poodles- who she claims are psychic . Linda, from Heanor, Derbyshire, bought twin apricot poodles Hilda and Tallulah three years ago after she was left heartbroken by the death of her loyal airedale, Stanley Rupert. The dogs, which are known as 'The Lulas', sit in on her sessions and paw her and stand up on their hind legs to relay to Linda personal details about her clients. Linda uses tarot cards, her crystal ball, and now her canine companions to help her pick up her clients' energy and assist them in matters of love, money and health. When in a session, Hilda will touch the person on the arm for example if it is a health problem. And if it is a relationship issue, Tallulah won't leave Linda alone. Linda said: 'As Tallulah and Hilda were growing up they were always sat in my office and when clients were sitting in front of me, ""The Lulas"" would start pawing me and they wouldn't leave me alone. Psychic poodles: She claims her four-legged friends, Hilda and Tallulah, can sniff out her clients health, money and relationship problems . Canine companions: The dogs, which are known as The Lullahs sit in on her sessions and paw her and stand up on their hind legs to relay to Linda personal details about her clients . 'Tallulah can detect relationship issues and will say ""mummy listen to me, this lady is not happy"" in my mind. Hilda knows when someone has money or health problems. 'I don't know how they do it. But my clients are amazed by them and now come especially for the poodles and want them to sit on the sofa with them. 'I love them with a passion and they sleep with me on the bed under their fleecey throw.' Linda always knew that she was different from other people, but did not realise her gift until she was older. Broomsticks: Linda has run her clairvoyant business from her home, named Broomsticks, for more than 40 years . She claims she has always had a very good sixth sense and intuition and charges her clients £40 per session. Linda said: 'It's a gift that I can't describe. I don't see ghosts but I do feel, sense and smell things. 'I can feel if someone is a good person and I can smell emotions. The smells are different kinds of smells to perfumes or body lotions - they are not of this realm. 'We are all different. Some people can play piano and I can't. I am not special or anything, I am just different.' Linda's parents emigrated to the UK from Poland. She used to work as a secretary and had also worked in factories and as a cleaner, but always felt she was destined for more spiritual things. As the phone calls from clients began to flood in, Linda started to rack up some impressive celebrity visitors. She said: 'I just said to myself one day, ""I am never going to work for anyone else again because I am so different,"" so I left work and put an advert in Prediction magazine and then the rest is history.' 'I meet people from all walks of life. I see people from stage and screen and politics but I have incredible integrity - and I work confidentially.' She had always loved animals and says she prefers them to people because they love unconditionally and are very loyal. Linda's sidekick was a dog called Stanley Rupert, until he passed away in 2009. Just the three of us: Linda is single and says she prefers dogs to human because they are loyal . Tuning in: She claims her dogs can tune into people's energy and has a list of celebrity clientele . She claims dogs can tune in to a higher frequency than humans, and that is how they predict the future and uncover secrets. Although Stanley was not psychic like the poodles, Linda was certain that he had a sixth sense. Linda said: 'I have been living on my own and have been single for years out of choice. If anyone came into my life who was not good, Stanley would become ill. 'It was strange because one minute he would be sick with bile and the next he would be running around like a lunatic once he knew that I had made a sensible decision not to associate with that person. He was my barometer.' Linda was heartbroken when Stanley died of organ failure at 11 years old. Heartbreak: Linda bought the twin poodles three years ago when she was left heartbroken by the death of her loyal airedale, Stanley Rupert . She said: 'I was bereft until the Lulas arrived. Stanley had a squeaky Santa toy that he always used to chew. 'Even after he died, this Santa toy would squeak for no reason. When the Lulas arrived, it just stopped as if by magic. 'He must have stayed with me until he knew I was happy with my two new Lulas and I am convinced he brought the three of us together.' Linda said she is estranged from her family apart from her daughter Katie. Katie has two sons, Ben, four, and Finlay, three. Linda has been married twice and is good friends with Katie's father and his wife. Katie, 34, has followed in her mother's footsteps and works as a psychic but is now launching her new business as an interior designer and uses her psychic abilities to tune into the owner's vibrations and personality. Linda said: 'Katie is very gifted too and has been able to see spirits since she was little. 'She went to Hull University and studied media and went on to work on a newspaper. But it wasn't right for her. 'I always said to her that one day she would come back to her psychic gift. If you are meant to do something, the powers that be will make sure you do. 'We all have a fate to follow. It is all planned out before we are born. This earth is for learning, it is a school.'

"A beauty queen who beat the bulge and dropped four dress sizes has offered advice to others battling with their weight. Nadina Knight, 24, the newly crowned Miss Northampton, was tipping the scales at 16 stone thanks to an unhealthy diet based on fast food and alcohol before an unflattering Facebook photo persuaded her to make a change. The grim photos, taken on her 20th birthday, made her realise how much weight she had gained and a confrontation with her mother brought matters to a head. Scroll down for video . Fighting fit: Chubby Nadina (left) shed the pounds and toned up to become Miss Northampton (right) Sensible: To lose weight, Nadina adopted a healthy eating regime and took up running . Looking good: Nadina is now fighting fit and wants to tell the world how to shed the pounds without crash diets . Toned: Fit and healthy Nadina works different stomach flattening exercises into her daily 10 minute work out . Miss England 2012 finalist Nadina said: 'I was slim until about the age of 16, when I started to have control over my own diet, I put on a little bit of weight. 'Then I went to university, I had even more control over what I ate and my weight just got out of hand. 'The quantity of food and drinking I was doing was too much. 'It wasn't until my 20th birthday, when I saw pictures of myself on Facebook, and my mum mentioned it, that I realised I had put on so much. 'My mum was concerned because she is diabetic and she expressed concerns about my size.' Nadina, who has since slimmed to a petite size 8 added: 'I had been caught off guard and there was just so much of me and I think that was when I thought 'my mum is right. 'The first thing I did was search Google for healthy living tips. I didn't want to diet like so many of my friends had done, I just wanted to lose the weight in a healthy and sustainable way.' Binge drinking: Industrial quantities of booze made Nadina pile on the pounds and also affected her skin . The gym was once an alien place for the previously overwight Nadina, whose diet consisted of greasy takeaways . Having shed four dress sizes, pretty Nadina, who had previously entered the Miss England competition twice before without success, tried again and this time succeeded. This she puts down to her healthier lifestyle, which includes small changes such as having skimmed milk, wholemeal bread and cutting out fizzy drinks and alcohol. She said: 'It was nothing drastic, but I felt this was the best way. So over the next three years it gradually fell off. 'I also go to the gym about three times a week. I won't ever let myself get to that stage again.' And her Miss Northampton title isn't the only pageant title she's won since fighting off the flab. Last year, Nadina, who is of Mauritian decent, won the title of the Mauritius Publicity Queen and claimed the first prize: a six day luxury trip to the island over Christmas. Coincidentally it just so happened to be her great-grandmother's 100th birthday on Christmas Eve. Nadina said: 'She was in so much shock. She hasn't seen me for 13 years so at first she didn't even recognise me. 'It was such an amazing trip. And being able to go for six days over Christmas, when her birthday fell on Christmas Eve, was so lucky, it was fate.' Now Nadina is pursuing a singing career as well as working with Miss England. What a difference! Now plump Nadina has become healthy, slim Nadina and Miss Northampton to boot . Gym bunny: Although Nadina spends plenty of time on the treadmill, she says it doesn't have to be every day . She said: 'The whole Miss England . experience was incredible. I was with everyone for four days straight . and you really start to become a family. I enjoyed myself so much. 'I made some great friends. The rumours you hear about beauty pageants being catty aren't true, everyone was really friendly. Once you're in, you're part of it forever.' As for losing the weight, Nadina says she is more confident than she has ever been before. She said: 'It has been bizarre after losing all of the weight. I look completely different and people who knew me then don't recognise me now. 'It has given me the confidence I didn't have before, I'm happier and most importantly I'm healthier which was my main goal.' 1. Swap white for brown: 'Ditch white carbohydrates in favour of wholemeal. Think brown bread, brown pasta and brown rice. This is such an easy rule to stick to and I noticed the difference almost immediately - less bloating and more energy.' 2. Don't skip meals: 'Three meals a day and plenty of water will stop you unnecessarily snacking. Try and eat things that will keep you fuelled longer in the mornings such as porridge or muesli with skimmed milk, then try a heavy salad or chicken and vegetables for lunch. This will enable you to eat lighter for dinner and resist the urge to snack. 3. Drinks count too: 'We often forget that what we are drinking is just as important as our food diet. Cut out fizzy drinks, drink plenty of water and herbal teas. Remember, everything in moderation - even fruit juice contains lots of sugar.' 4. Have fun: 'Don't jeopardise your social life, remember you can still pick healthy options when eating out. A favourite of mine is the Arrosto salad at Prezzo, packed full of artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and chicken and do remember alcohol can heavily contribute to weight gain (this was one of my biggest downfalls when I was at my heaviest) and can have a detrimental affect on your skin, liver and overall health.' 5. Stay clear of saturated fat: 'Saturated fats are a tough one for us all. We love a croissant in the morning or cheese and crackers after dinner but these create the fatty pockets we all hate. Instead enjoy good fats in moderation and try switching your regular cooking oil for olive oil.' 6. Stay active: 'An active lifestyle will keep you in shape but even if you're busy and feel you don't have time for the gym, try home-work outs. I am a huge fan of these and there is so much you can do.' 7. 10 minute ab work-outs: 'I try to do this every day! I use a different ab exercise for every two minutes of my 10 minute work-out. Plank and side plank is always a must for me, Bicycles to work your obliques, crunches to work your upper abs, full sit ups to work everything and leg raises to work your lower abs.' 8. Keep glutes and hamstrings toned: 'Try leg lifts. On all fours, lift your legs to a 90 degree angle. Try doing sets on each leg alternating eight times on each. Keep your quads toned too - try lunges, which are easy to do at home and a great exercise for toned thighs. 9. Inner thighs and bum: 'To keep these toned I do 'Sumo' squats, which are your normal squat but with hands out in front and feet pointing outwards slightly. It's similar to the plié ballet move but with your bottom out rather than tucked in. 10. Running: 'I make excuses all the time about this one but it's so easy to go for a quick run around your local area. Even a quick 10 minute mile will get you feeling fresh and motivated and burn fat.'","Nadina Knight, 24, dropped four dress sizes to a size 8 .

"A European flight was delayed for five hours over safety concerns - after a mouse was spotted on-board. The Swiss aircraft was supposed to depart Zurich for Malaga on Monday at 12.05pm. But a member of cabin crew saw the rodent at the rear of the Airbus A320 and immediately grounded the plane for safety reasons. Passengers on board a Swiss air flight were delayed for five hours - because of a mouse . Passengers then had to wait until 5pm for a new plane to arrive to fly them to Spain. There are always fears that the rogue rodent could have gnawed through any important wires on the aircraft. The mouse was eventually caught and, after a safety check, the plane was given the all-clear and returned to flight today. A spokesperson for Swiss said: 'The aircraft was still on the ground in Zurich as a member of the cabin crew saw a mouse in the Eco-Galley in the back of the A320 aircraft. 'For evident safety reasons, Swiss grounded immediately the aircraft and proceeded to an aircraft change. Cabin crew pointed out that they had seen a mouse, and the plan was grounded . 'The passengers could fly later in the afternoon yesterday (Mon) just after 17:00 to Malaga. 'The Swiss maintenance proceeded yesterday to an in-depth check in order to find the mouse, this with success. 'Since this morning (Tuesday), the aircraft is released and back to the operations again. Such a situation happens very rarely at Swiss.' It is not the first time a plane has been grounded in Switzerland due to a mouse on board. In 2001, a rodent was spotted as an aircraft came into land after flying from the Dominican Republic. Then, two-years later, a pair of mice escaped from a container in the hold of a plane on a flight from the American city of Boston. Last year a plane supposed to travel from Heathrow to New York was grounded shortly before take-off when a mouse was spotted.","Mouse spotted scuttling around by Swiss plane cabin crew .

"Ray Rice is fighting back against the NFL one week after video of him punching his then-fiancée Janay Palmer in an Atlantic City casino elevator went public. Rice, 27, is expected to file an appeal with the help of the NFL Players' Association and an outside attorney later today, claiming he notified both the Baltimore Ravens and the NFL about his altercation back in June of this year. The running back was originally just handed down a two-game suspension as a result of his actions in July for violating the NFL personal conduct policy. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Ray Rice (above right, with now-wife Janay Rice) is expected to appeal his indefinite suspension from the NFL later today . Harsher penalty: Rice had his punishment increased from a two-game suspension after video of him punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday . Rice must file his appeal by 11:59 pm on Tuesday, three business days after NFL commissioner Roger Goodell officially notified the players' union of his indefinite suspension. Sources tell The Baltimore Sun that the football star is also considering possible legal action following his increased discipline from the league, feeling that he has been punished twice for the same offense. In his letter to the Player's Association on Friday explaining Rice's new punishment, Goodell wrote, 'This video shows a starkly different sequence of events from what you and your representatives stated when we met on June 16, and is important new information that warrants reconsideration of the discipline imposed on you in July.' The commissioner added, 'Based on this new information, I have concluded that the discipline imposed upon you in July was insufficient under all the circumstances and have determined instead to impose an indefinite suspension.' In the dark: In a letter to the Players' Association, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell claims he was unaware of the severity of the abuse prior to seeing last week's video . Support: Many fans have rallied behind Rice, who feels he is being punished twice for the same mistake . Public support: Rice and wife Janay appeared together for the first time since the incident over then weekend, attending a high school football game in New Rochelle, New York . There has been some debate however over how much Goodell knew of the situation prior to last Monday, with one anonymous New Jersey law enforcement official saying last week he personally sent a tape of the incident to an NFL executive in April. Multiple sources close to Rice also back up the story that the athlete was honest and upfront about the events that took place in that elevator last February when he met with Goodell in June. Furthermore, under Article 46, Section 4 of the NFL collective bargaining agreement, it states, 'The Commissioner and a Club will not both discipline a player for the same act or conduct. The Commissioner’s disciplinary action will preclude or supersede disciplinary action by any Club for the same act or conduct.' Prior to his suspension by the NFL Monday afternoon, Rice had his five-year, $35 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens terminated, losing $3.529 million in salary for the season. While Rice has yet to make any public statement about the appeal or possible legal action, he did make his first public appearance since this video surfaced last week, attending a high school football game with his now-wife Janay and daughter in New Rochelle, New York over the weekend. Janay has been incredibly critical of the media in the days following the release of this tape, writing last week on her private Instagram, 'I woke up this morning feeling like I had a horrible nightmare, feeling like I’m mourning the death of my closest friend. But to have to accept the fact that it’s reality is a nightmare in itself. No one knows the pain that hte [sic] media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family. To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing. To take something away from the man I love that he has worked his ass of for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific.' She continued, 'THIS IS OUR LIFE! What don’t you all get. If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take all happiness away, you’ve succeeded on so many levels. Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is! Ravensnation we love you!' Mrs. Rice also showed her support for another individual under fire from the NFL this weekend,saying on Twitter that the league has no right to tell Adrian Peterson how to discipline his child. Peterson was recently indicted on charges of child abuse for beating one of his sons with a tree branch last May.","Ray Rice is expected to appeal his indefinite suspension handed down by the NFL last week .

"Just a few short years ago, long, straight hair was everywhere you looked. From the catwalk to the red carpet and the high street, flicky locks and honeyed highlights were everywhere. Now, thanks to Rihanna and other celebrities willing to brave the chop, things have changed. From pink hair to undercuts, pixie crops, fringes and ombre, Britain's streets are awash with different colours, shapes and styles. But your choice of cut says more about you than you realise - and plays a huge role in the way you feel about yourself. Unexpressive: Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston both have haircuts that conceal their personalities . Masculine: Short haired women like Lena Dunham and Miley Cyrus are widely regarded as slightly manly . 'Hair is called a secondary sexual characteristic,' says leading trichologist Philip Kingsley. 'You can't flaunt your primary sexual characteristics in public, at least not in western society, so that's what makes your hair important from a social viewpoint. 'It's about sexuality and morale. Lots of women - and men - find that if they are not happy with their hair, then they are unhappy people.' And it's precisely because hair is a secondary sexual characteristic that long, glossy hair - which denotes youth and fertility - has been so popular for so long. As a result, short, cropped styles are widely considered masculine, according to Karin Lesnik-Oberstein, a professor of critical theory at the University of Reading and editor of The Last Tabooo: Women And Body Hair. 'Short hair is still equated with masculinity,' she revealed in an interview with the Observer Magazine. 'I have very short hair and in England, I often get mistaken for a man. That never happens to me on the continent - for instance in Germany and Holland, where a lot of these societies are more egalitarian and matriarchal.' But despite the explosion in different styles ('It's not one iconic haircut anymore,' reveals award-winning stylist, Luke Hersheson), long, glossy locks not only remain the default option for many, they're also seen as the most glamorous. Likeable: The Duchess of Cambridge and Kim Sears boast glossy wavy hair - and are liked as a result . Zany: Women who make bold colour choices such as Emilie Sande and Katy Perry are regarded as quirky . Straight - unexpressive . Bright colour - quirky . Fringe - individual . Wavy - likeable . Long - glamorous . Short - masculine . According to fashion historian Caroline Cox, the dominant trend today is for styling rather than cutting and for 'long, glamorous hair and lots of it.' It's a look that cuts across social classes and is as likely to be spotted on TOWIE stars as it is on royalty, albeit with a few crucial differences. From the Duchess of Cambridge and Kim Sears' blow-dried locks - in both cases the mark of a woman with the time and money to spend on her hair - to Kim Kardashian and Amy Childs' extravagant extensions, long hair is glamorous no matter what. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the UK is now the third-largest importer of human hair in the world, with £38m worth entering the country every year. 'It's a traditional idea of female glamour and it's kind of boring,' adds Cox. 'It's the whole pole dancer look: huge heads of artificial hair, faces that look like they've been dipped in a bucket of make-up, ultra short skirts and huge stripper heels. 'In terms of fashion and feminism, it's like ""oh my God, what was I fighting for?""' Nevertheless, long 'natural' hair that waves or curls is seen as likeable, and in Sears and the Duchess of Cambridge's case, demure. Individual: Those who plump for fringes like Michelle Obama and Sienna Miller know what they like and dislike . Colour too is changing, with blondeness - once regarded as a signifier of youth - becoming dated thanks to the large numbers of older women who wear it. 'Blondeness used to be a sign of youth,' adds Cox. 'Now because so many women post-50 are dyeing their hair blonde, it's a sign of maturity and young women are increasingly dyeing their hair in a grey tone that's almost silver or pale blue.' Ultimately, we're slowly moving away from the identikit blonde, straightened look that dominated the noughties and Hersheson, in particular, is thrilled. 'People used to embrace having the same haircut as Jennifer Aniston,' he explains. 'Now there are 20 or 30 new trends and individuality is so much more important.'","Women with wavy or curly hair are perceived as being likeable and friendly .
Those with short hair like Miley Cyrus are regarded as being masculine .
According to Phillip Kingsley, hair is a secondary sexual characteristic .

Mr Westwood, of North Shields, North Tyneside, was threatened with being cut off if he did not pay. He said: 'It was an excessive phone bill by anyone’s standards.

"Thomas Eric Duncan was one of five people who rode in a cab with an infected woman who later died . The Liberian cab driver who ferried U.S. Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan and a pregnant 19-year-old who he was helping has said that the woman was so sick she could not walk and had blood trickling out of her mouth. It is believed that Duncan contracted the deadly virus on that the taxi ride in Monrovia, Liberia, with Nathaline Williams. Ebola spreads by contact with an infected person's blood, sweat, saliva or other bodily fluids. Five people rode in Jiminez Grugbaye's cab as they searched for a hospital for Williams on September 15. Williams later died of Ebola. Her brother, who was with her in the car, died days later. Her parents, who were also in the cab, are currently hospitalized with the disease. Still, when Duncan flew out of Monrovia en route to Dallas, Texas, he claimed he had not come in contact with anyone infected with Ebola. When he showed up at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas with a fever, headache, abdominal pain and decreased urination on September 25, he again claimed he had never come in contact with anyone afflicted with the virulent virus that has already killed 3,300 in West Africa, the hospital announced on Thursday. Mr Grugbaye, the taxi driver, told an NBC News crew in Liberia that he had picked up Miss Williams  and ferried her to three hospitals and a clinic while she convulsed and moaned in the back seat. She was clearly very sick and feeble, he said. Scroll down for video . Jiminez Grugbaye says he drove the taxi that ferried Duncan and a sick pregnant woman in search of a hospital. All five people who rode in the cab have either died of Ebola or are infected with it . 'She was helpless. She, she was not able to walk by herself,' he told NBC. Mr Grubaye said he noticed a stream of blood trickling from Williams' mouth. However, her family told him that she had only bit her tongue and that she was suffering a miscarriage - not sick with Ebola. Despite Williams' dire condition, she was turned away at three hospitals and a neighborhood clinic. Ebola is ripping through the 72nd SKD Boulevard neighborhood where Duncan lived in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, spreading faster than health officials in the impoverished nation can stop its spread. Four days after Duncan's counter with Ebola-stricken Williams, he boarded a plane for Brussels, Belgium. From there, he flew on a United Airlines flight to Washington Dulles International Airport, where he was allowed into the country. Duncan then flew to Dallas, where he stayed with his girlfriend for five days while Ebola began to run its course.","Jiminez Grugbaye says Thomas Eric Duncan rode in his cab with Nathaline Williams, who later died of Ebola .

"Members of the Jedi church believe in the Force, rather than the Holy Ghost. It's a religion barely two decades old and based off a movie franchise, but there's still a lot the Jedi have in common with other religious groups. Details' Benjamin Svetkey recently attended a gathering of Jedi in Norris, Texas where he witnessed the 'knighting' of padawon learner Ally Thompson, 28, an Iraqi-war veteran from Tennessee. From the get go, Ms Thompson explains that her religion doesn't seek to turn fictional characters like Yoda or Obi-Wan Kenobi into idols. Scroll down for video . Father, son and the holy Force: Jediism is a growing religion around the world. The church began to form in the late 1990s, and is based off the league of knights from the Star Wars movie franchise . 'No we don't worship Yoda. And telekinesis is not something that we necessarily do - at least not like in the movies,' she explains. But I won't deny that the Force is very present in our teachings. Some people call it magic. Some call it Ashe. The scientific community calls it energy. But it's everywhere. You can find it in the Bible. When Moses parted the Red Sea - how did he do that? With energy. With the Force.' Jedi Knight: Kevin Trout, aka Opie MacLeod (above), is one of the preeminent Jedi church leaders. He has written five books on the religion . While the group in Texas only included fifteen men and three women, The Jedi church has been growing around the world. In England it's the seventh-largest religion with 175,000 members. There are 15,000 Jedi in the Czech republic, 9,000 in Canada and 65,000 in Australia. While many of these so-called members list the Jedi church as a joke, John Henry Phelan, who runs TempleOfTheJediOrder.org (the most trafficked Jedi church website online), estimates that there are about 5,000 real Jedi in the U.S. 'I'm talking serious, committed Jedi - not people who sign up on a website because they're curious or bored,' Mr Phelan says. One of Jediism's prominent members, Kevin Trout (known as Opie MacLeod in the community), explains how the late 90s created the perfect storm upon which to start the religion. 'With Jediism you needed a way for people to connect,' Mr Trout says, meaning the internet. 'And you needed something to reignite the imagination, which was the re-release of the first three Star Wars movies in 1997, then the release of Episode I in 1999.' While it may sound like a crazy concept, Jediism already shares a lot with mainstream religions. Like the Mormans were driven from the Midwest in their church's early years, so the Jedi are facing their own type of persecution. Trout explains that he usually keeps his Jedi beliefs hidden from women in the early stages of a relationship. 'Yeah, there's a stigma to being a Jedi. But most Jedi prefer that to the baggage other religions carry around from history. You know, like the Crusades.' And who needs women when you can move objects with your mind? COURTESY TEMPLE OF THE JEDI ORDER . The battle of good versus evil: Trout, left, is pictured fighting another with the Jedi's weapon of choice - the light-saber . 'There have been times when I've found myself on the freeway behind some horrible driver and I'll do the Jedi hand trick: ""Take the next exit, that is the exit you're looking for...""' Trout said. Jedi mind tricks aside, the group's real center revolves around an ethical system just like any other religion. Basically it all stems from a Jedi code laid out in a Star Wars role-playing guide from 1987, which states: . 'There is no emotion, there is peaceThere is no ignorance, there is knowledgeThere is no passion, there is serenityThere is no death, there is the force.' Anthropologist Matthew Kappel who wrote 'Finding the Force of the Star Wars Franchise: Fans, Merchandise, and the Critics' explains that it was the participatory nature of the book that helped start the religion, and the code's content that gave it a purpose. Mind over matter: Above, Trout is pictured competing in a Spartan Race . 'The Code is in the glossary in the back in the ""stuff you need to know"" section. But what's important about the book from an anthropological point of view, is that it's participatory. It's the first Star Wars role-playing game. Before the book, you could only see the movies. Afterward you could participate in its fictional world. And you can't have a religion without participation,' Kappel said. For members of Jediism, the point of religion is not to secure some spot in the afterlife, but to do right for humankind on earth which translates to a lot of community service time. 'With Jediism...our religious observance is found through service ot the community,' said 30-year-old Jedi Knight Andy Spaulding, who is also a member of the Kentucky National Guardsmen. 'Service is sort of what we do for prayer.'","According to a report in Details, the church based off the Star Wars franchise has grown to include thousands of members .
In the UK, Jediism is the seventh-largest religion. Experts estimate that there are 5,000 members in the U.S."
"A year ago, Landon Jones stopped eating. Overnight, the 12-year-old's appetite disappeared without warning, hours after he devoured a pizza and  bowl of ice cream. Waking up on the morning of October 14, 2013, Landon had lost all sense of hunger and thirst, The Des Moines Register reported. The once energetic youngster, who loved nothing more than going out on his bike and playing in the park with his friends and brother, stopped. He was sick and suffered dizziness almost 24 hours a day. Landon Jones, 12, from Waterloo, Iowa, lost his appetite last October. His parents Michael and Debbie have struggled to encourage him to eat every day for a year and are desperate for help to discover what is wrong with their son after tests at five different hospitals failed to offer a diagnosis . Today Landon's parents Michael and Debbie are at their wits end, desperate for help to discover what is wrong with their son. Their quest for a diagnosis has taken the family to five different cities across the US. The local pediatrician in Waterloo, Iowa, prescribed antibiotics - but still Landon would not eat or drink. Doctors in Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, and Madison were consulted. And Mr and Mrs Jones took their son to Rochester in Minnesota where experts at the world-renowned Mayo Clinic examined Landon's case. But their frustrating search has, so far, produced no answers. The National Institutes of Health in the US is now considering offering Landon an appointment - they only examine the rarest of cases each year. In the last year Landon has shed almost 36lbs, plummeting from 104lbs to 68lbs, after he started to lose around 2lbs a week last autumn. Mr and Mrs Jones have tried everything they can think of to encourage their son to eat. But the 12-year-old rarely eats more than a bite of his sandwich at lunch and a few crisps. Experts at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester say they believe Landon's may be the first case of its kind in the world . While his younger brother Bryce, nine, bounds in from school each day to play with the family's dog, lethargic Landon prefers to lie on the sofa. In the last year he has missed 65 days of school. And his parents say he hasn't run for months, forced to watch his classmates from the sidelines. Repeatedly Landon's parents urge him to take a bite to eat, take a drink. The next step, they say, is to insert a feeding tube, to help nourish Landon directly through his stomach. Mr Jones said they believe their son's illness is linked to the hypothalamus in Landon's brain, malfunctioning. The size of a flattened pea, it regulates hunger and thirst as well as body temperature, blood pressure and sleep cycles. Dr Marc Patterson, a child neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, said Landon's may be the only case of its kind in the world. Mr Jones said another possible cause of Landon's illness is treatment he received three years ago for absence seizures. The then nine-year-old would sit and stare into the distance, oblivious to the world around him. Doctors prescribed him Depakote, commonly used to treat such seizures, and was on the drug for a year. The family doctor has now questioned whether there is a link between the drug and the suppression of Landon's appetite. But Dr Patterson said the drug is typically linked to increased hunger and weight gain. Now Mr and Mrs Jones' plea is simple, they are appealing for anyone who can help to get in contact.

"'Spider': John Coffey (pictured) was at head of a traveller family which avoided paying taxes and falsely claimed benefits totalling £600,000 . Five members of a traveller family who avoided paying £500,000 in taxes and fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits were sentenced today. Husband and wife John and Brigid Coffey, and their children Michael, Mary and Helen were earning millions of pounds from two resurfacing and block paving businesses. While John and Michael Coffey deliberately laundered the money to avoid paying taxes, the female members of the family claimed thousands of pounds in benefits. This was despite the family owning valuable real estate and a number of expensive cars. John Coffey, 49, sat alongside Brigid, 51, Mary, 28, Helen 26, and Michael, 23, at Bristol Crown Court after pleading guilty to 20 tax evasion and other fraud offences between 2001 and 2008. The court heard the family, who lived in South Wales and Gloucestershire, dealt mostly in cash, with John and Michael Coffey only declaring an income of £250 a week between them. During a police interview, John Coffey claimed their money came from block paving, horses and 'general wheeling and dealing'. Judge David Ticehurst jailed John Coffey, whose tax evasion amounted to £450,000, for two years and nine months and was told he must repay the amount in full within 28 days. Michael Coffey, who avoided paying £50,000 in tax, was handed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years. He was also told he would have to repay the money. 'It’s individuals like you that give the travelling community a bad name,' Judge Ticehurst said. 'Criminal conduct like yours brings your community into disrepute and reinforces prejudice. None of us like paying taxes, but society functions on the fact that people pay money to the revenue. 'These taxes are used to fund hospitals, schools, nurses and roads. You, however, choose not to pay tax and to falsely claim benefits of which you were not entitled. 'What is overwhelmingly clear in this case is that each one of you is dishonest. There can be no excuses for your behaviour.' Lavish: The Coffey family's property portfolio included Ton Y Pill farm, which has tall gates and CCTV cameras . Conning the public purse: John Coffey (pictured, left, outside Bristol Crown Court) and his son Michael Coffey (right) laundered money from their paving and resurfacing businesses to avoid paying £500,000 in taxes . The court heard Brigid Coffey claimed £39,789 in benefits, while Helen Coffey claimed £14,544.40 and Mary Coffey a sum of £53,893.44. Brigid Coffey was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months and ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work. Helen Coffey was handed a 12-month prison sentence also suspended for 18 months. She was told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Mary Coffey was given a suspended sentence of 12 months imprisonment and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Compensation . orders were made in the amounts claimed by Brigid and Helen Coffey . while Judge Ticehurst adjourned making an order against Mary Coffey for . further representations to be made. 'Dishonest': Michael Coffey, pictured carrying a large holdall, was given a suspended prison sentence . Opening the case, Don Tait, prosecuting, said: 'All of the defendants in this case are members of the travelling community, living predominantly in South Wales and Gloucestershire. 'It is the Crown’s case that the family as a whole operated for most of their life on the fringe of society.' The family, who owned two Mercedes, an . Audi and a Mitsubishi pick-up, were able to pass almost £2million . through their 35 bank accounts by using false names and documents. In . one fraudulent house transfer, John Coffey hired two sets of solicitors . and acted the roles of both seller and purchaser simultaneously in . order to transfer property around the family in different names - making . it unclear who owned what. A . number of properties, including two farms in Peterstone Wentlooge, . Cardiff, a £500,000 house in West Drayton, Middlesex, and two houses in . Rumney, Cardiff, were registered to the family. Spared jail: Wife Brigid Coffey, who tried to conceal her identity (right) was given an 12-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming nearly £40,000 in benefits . They lived in Ton Y Pill Farm - a walled property, which boasted high gates and CCTV cameras. But the court heard it was not clear where the funds to buy the properties came from. The family also owned and used two plots at the Mount View Caravan Site in Naas Lane, Brookthorpe, near Gloucester. The properties were mostly paid for by cash or banker’s draft with no mortgages. The family ran two companies, B&B Welsh Paving and Sunset Drives and Landscapes Ltd, which provided driveway resurfacing services. Walked free: Helen Coffey (left) and her sister Mary (right) were given 12-month suspended prison sentences after fraudulently claiming £14,544.40 and £53,893.44 respectively . The latter was set up in 2006 as a front to deliberately conceal the extent of their business revenues, Mr Tait said. But investigations into the family’s bank accounts showed a vast turnover of money. 'The . family appeared to be awash with cash, invested in real estate and . vehicles, yet the female family members were claiming benefits using . subterfuge and non-declaration, said Mr Tait. The . family looked to invest in Spanish properties in the Costa del Sol and . Riviera del Sol, although they never completed on any of their plans to . buy. John Coffey was described by the judge as the 'spider' at the centre of a web of deceit. The court was told his son was just 12 years old when the family fraud began and 17 when he was first arrested in 2007. Addressing . the judge, Raymond Tully, defending Michael Coffey, said: 'It goes . almost without saying you are sentencing a son for crimes committed . together with his father at a time when he was of very tender years.' While the men avoided paying tax, the family women fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits. Unwelcome publicity: Helen Coffey, 26, makes an offensive gesture as she hides her face from photographers . The three women told authorities they had no savings or assets and claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit and money from a Social Fund Budgeting Loan. They used a variety of names and stories, on occasion claiming to be single parents who needed the money to buy clothing and footwear. Prithvijit Hoon, defending Brigid Coffey, said: 'One of the ethos of the travel community is the status of the wife being deferential towards her husband.' Christopher Quinlan, mitigating for John Coffey, said: 'Mr Coffey was running a business in respect to which work was done and money was paid. He did not declare that income in terms of tax. 'Mr Coffey is an industrious, hard-working man and the Revenue have got their money through his hard work.' The court heard £500,000 has already been restrained from the family’s bank accounts and is now subject to confiscation proceedings. In 2010 John Coffey and Michael Coffey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulently taking steps to divert money from HM Treasury or to deprive HM Treasury of money to which it was entitled. John Coffey also admitted two counts of knowingly using a false Irish driving licence. Facing justice: Mary Coffey (left) and Brigid Coffey (centre) outside Bristol Crown Court, where they were sentenced . Brigid Coffey pleaded guilty to five counts of making a false statement to obtain benefits, while mother-of-five Mary Coffey pleaded guilty to seven counts of making false statements. Helen Coffey, a mother of one, pleaded guilty in respect of an ongoing claim for income support, failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of her bank accounts with positive balances, and the fact that she was married. She also admitted making a false statement to obtain a Social Fund Budgeting Loan and two counts of providing the false name Helen Delaney to Cardiff Magistrates’ Court in October 2005 and April 2006. Officers from five police forces, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions worked together to bring the Coffeys to justice. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Shorrock, who led the investigation for Gloucestershire Police, said: 'The sentencing of the Coffey family marks the culmination of many years of work by literally hundreds of officers and officials. Covered up: Defendants John Coffey (left) and Helen Coffey (right) tried to hide their faces outside court . 'This family had been engaging in questionable financial and business activities for many years, until we collectively caught up with them.' Simon De Kayne, assistant director of criminal investigation, HM Revenue and Customs, said: 'The Coffeys blatantly evaded UK tax laws to selfishly steal around £500,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund their criminally gained lifestyles and expanding property portfolio. 'The sentencing shows HMRC, along with our partner agencies, will not only pursue and prosecute tax fraudsters but also seek to reclaim the proceeds of their crimes.' Andrew Biker, of CPS central fraud division, said: 'No income was ever declared by John Coffey to the Inland Revenue despite him working all his life in the tarmac and block paving industries. 'Even more money was made buying and selling cars and trading horses. 'The sheer number of bank accounts operated by the family and their ability to transfer significant funds between them fly in the face of their claims of illiteracy and ignorance of matters such as income tax. 'No matter how you earn money, paying tax matters. But denying the honest British public of their contribution to tax was not enough for the Coffeys who went further by setting out to take funds set aside for those who most need them. 'People can rest assured that the CPS will do all it can to deprive these criminals of their assets and put the money back where it belongs - into the public purse.'","Kingpin John Coffey, 49, avoided £450,000 in taxes between 2001 and 2008 .

"A 17-year-old boy has been named prom queen at his high school and says he's making a point about gender labeling and discrimination. Nasir Fleming won the title last week at Danbury High School in Connecticut, where he's a popular senior. He was nominated as prom king and as prom queen but decided to be considered only for queen. Fleming told the News Times newspaper for a story on Tuesday that he's been openly gay since sixth grade and has struggled with bullying. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Nasir Fleming, prom queen, and his date Amanda Datillo at the big event last week . Nasir Fleming being crowned at the prom hosted by Danbury High School in Connecticut . He said he isn't sure whether the students who submitted his name were making fun of his sexuality but decided it was a good opportunity to make a point about the importance of being who you are. 'Either way, I'm still fabulous,' he said. Fleming said students at the prom were supportive and erupted in cheers when he won. His date Amanda Datillo told reporters that Fleming was 'happy and giddy.' 'I was flabbergasted,' he told the News Times newspaper. The audience was surprised and extremely supportive. The audience was more excited than I was.' Fleming said his selection as prom queen is a step forward for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people - but he wasn't expecting to win. His date to the prom, senior Amanda Dattilo, said the honor left him truly stunned. 'Afterwards,' she said, 'he was all happy and giddy.' Danbury High's principal, Gary Bocaccio, said students nominate their classmates and anyone can be nominated for king or queen. He said he didn't know if Fleming was the school's first male prom queen. The 17-year-old senior Nasir Fleming says he is gay and has been out since the sixth grade and has struggled with bullying for much of his young life because of his sexual orientation . The students at Danbury High School cheered for Nasir who was shocked and 'giddy' after winning the award . Fleming posted a video on his Youtube account of the magical event along with a statement. 'Even though I identify as male, winning this title is a statement against transphobia,' the statement reads. 'As gay people, more or less, are becoming accepted in society, transgendered people are still discriminated against severely.' 'If I can win a title that is outside of my gender, there is no reason why a trans-person should have any problems winning titles in his/her gender. Stop the hate, start the love.' Unfortunately there were a few negative comments on his Youtube page as well after he posted the video. One commenter claimed that Fleming was 'making a mockery' of the prom tradition. Fleming said merely that he 'loves controversy' and expected backlash when posting the video but was shocked to see comments coming from adults. 'It's so upsetting when you see a 45-year-old making comments about a 17-year-old,' Fleming said. 'It's disgusting.' He said he doesn't blame kids for their negative opinions regarding his life choices and sexuality. 'I didn't blame the kids,' he said. 'It's never the kids' fault. It's the parents' fault.' 'We need to push past tolerance and start having acceptance,' he concluded.","Nasir Fleming won the title as Prom Queen last week at Danbury High School, where he's a popular senior .

"When Red Sox Legend Ted Williams passed away at at the age of 83 in July 2002, his body was quickly flown from his home of Iverness, Florida to a center in Arizona where his body was cryogenically frozen so that he could be brought back to life in the future. But that's not what the player known as 'The Kid' wanted. A new book by Ben Bradlee Jr explains how Williams' son John-Henry continually fought his father's will to be cremated. Together forever: A new book reveals how Red Sox legend Ted Williams' (right) son John-Henry (left) went against his will and had him cryogenically frozen. When John-Henry died two years later, he had the same procedure . The last time Williams amended his will was in 1996, and at that time he stated that he wanted to have his body cremated and scattered over his Florida Keys fishing grounds along with the ashes of his Dalmatian named Slugger who died in 1999. Accounts: The new book by Ben Bradlee Jr includes interviews with people closer to the elder Williams near his death, who insist he never wavered from his intention to be cremated . While John-Henry would say his father warmed to the idea of cryogenics later in life, nurses who cared for the elder Williams say he never wavered from his cremation intentions. Debbie Erb treated Williams in November 2000 when he underwent surgery at Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Florida. Erb and Williams shared a love for fishing the Florida Keys and one day she brought in pictures from one of her trips. That prompted Williams and his aid Frank Brothers to start discussing one of their fishing trips to Islamorada, and Brothers mentioned that his father had his ashes scattered there. 'Then Ted said he wanted to do what his friend did, and that is be cremated and have his ashes scattered in the Keys,' Erb said. After Williams left the hospital, he was cared for by nurse Becky Vaughn at his home in Iverness. She recalls one day when John-Henry came over and started chatting to her about cryogenics. John-Henry had been a disciple of the theoretical medicine since 1997, and spoke giddily about the prospect of life after death. 'Then John-Henry, in his Peter Pan way, said, ""Just think of it, 1,000 years from now, people could say their child could have a piece of Ted Williams."" ‘They could clone my father’s eyes, and a child could have Ted Williams’ eyesight. And they could bring him back to life and he could feel great,' he said. Sight: John-Henry spoke of the possibility of cloning his father's eyes so that people in the future could have his vision . Stop talking about that b***s***!: One nurse recalls being in a room with the father and son when the elder Williams woke up and told John-Henry to quit talking about cryogenics . 'What makes you think Ted would want that?' Ms Vaughn asked. At that moment, Williams stirred and interrupted the conversation. 'John-Henry!' Williams said. 'Stop talking about that b***s***!' Ms Vaughn asked what Williams wanted. 'In his will he doesn’t want a funeral. He wants to be cremated and sprinkled over where he used to fish in the Keys,' John-Henry responded. 'If that's what his will says, then that's what he wants,' Ms Vaugn said. 'There are ways to get around things like that,' John-Henry said. The . book also details just how John-Henry circumvented his fathers will, and . the process cryogenics scientists went through to preserve his body. Williams had never applied for cryogenics at Alcor, the facility in Arizona that carried out the procedure. But John-Henry had faxed a completed application six hours before his death with his father's signature. And . after being granted power of attorney and health proxy for his father, . John-Henry had the power to make all decisions at the end of Williams' life, despite his father's differing will. Preserved: Alcor has been cryogenically freezing 'patients' since 1976, putting their bodies and heads in Thermos-like steel tubes . While his half-sister Bobby-Jo disagreed with going against their father's wishes for cremation, John-Henry was able to secure the support of his younger sister Claudia for cryogenics. So after his death, he was packed in an ice box and quickly shipped to Alcor Life Extension Foundation, just outside Scottsdale, Arizona. Beheaded: Williams' head was severed from his body in the process of being frozen . Alcor has been freezing 'patients' since 1976. The two basic options for Alcor customers were a 'whole body' procedure which cost $120,000 and a $50,000 'neuro' procedure which just freezes the head. A third option was to freeze both the head and the body separately, and that's the process Williams went through. In cryogenics, the brain is . considered the most vital organ as it contains the memory. Granted that . medicine has progressed to the stage that people can be brought back to . life, it's assumed that the other organs can be recreated via stem cells. So Alcor scientists removed Williams' head and stored both his body and head in Thermos bottle-like tanks called 'Dewars'. His head was put in the Dewar upside and rested on a can of tuna so that it didn't sit at the bottom of the stockpot. When . John-Henry followed his father in death just two years later at the . young age of 35, after being diagnosed with leukemia, his body was . preserved the same way. Nurse Vaugn doesn't believe John-Henry exploited his father, but that he was just too caught up in his own obsession. 'I . felt he was this little boy who wanted to make his dad happy, but never . dealt in reality. A little boy in a man's body. He was going to make . people happy by cloning his dad's eyes. Who thinks like that? I think he . felt this was how they'd make their money in the future. I don't know . if he was thinking, ""Hey I can take advantage of this old guy."" I . thought it was more: ""I'm gonna do this for my dad and we'll live . forever."" It was very Peter Pan.' Never grow up: Nurse Vaugn doesn't think that . John-Henry was exploiting his father, rather he was too caught up in his . own obsession with cryogenics .","Ted Williams, aka 'The Kid', became famous as a left-fielder for the Boston Red Sox .

"The third round of the FA Youth Cup continued on Tuesday night, with Southampton, Everton and Hull City all progressing in the tournament. Southampton saw off the challenge of West Ham United at St Mary's Stadium in an exciting affair. Dan Demkiv's neat finish and a cracking 30-yard strike from Callum Slattery proved enough to down the Hammers as the Saints came from behind to triumph.

"A long-lost Disney cartoon that features a character who was the prototype for Mickey Mouse has been discovered in a British film archive. The cartoon, called Hungry Hobos, was made in 1928 but has been missing since before World War II. The black-and-white footage features Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and was drawn shortly before the character was abandoned and turned into Mickey Mouse that same year. Scroll down for video . Rediscovered: Hungry Hobos, a five-minute silent cartoon not seen since before the Second World War, has been found in a Herefordshire film archive. The short features Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (left), the prototype for Mickey Mouse . Incredibly, the five-minute silent cartoon has turned up in a vault at the Huntley Film Archives in Herefordshire, where it has sat for decades. Amanda . Huntley, who runs the company, said a colleague stumbled upon it on a . shelf and out of curiosity searched its name on Google and discovered it was a . 'lost' classic. She said: 'There are a lot of lost films out there. This was made in 1928 and has been in our collection for decades. 'We specialise in social history films and not animation. But my colleague took the film from the shelf and Googled it - I don't really know why. 'We . quickly realised it was one of the great lost films. We posted the news . on specialist web forums and everybody was very excited.' Glimpse into the past: So rare is the 83-year-old animation that archivists dared only play it once while taking photos of the playback monitor with handheld cameras . Credits: Oswald's facial features and behaviour are clearly those of Mickey Mouse . Hungry Hobos follows a starving Oswald and his friend Peg Leg Pete on . a train. They rob a chicken of her egg by squeezing the animal and cook . it by using the train's wheels. Oswald's facial features and behaviour are clearly those of Mickey Mouse - the legendary character that has endured ever since. The whereabouts of the film has for decades baffled animation experts, who believed it would never be seen again. It is now expected to fetch at least £25,000 ($39,000) when . it goes under the hammer at Bonhams' Entertainment Memorabilia auction . in Los Angeles next month. Hungry Hobos was released for general . screening on May 14, 1928, just one day before Mickey Mouse's feature . debut, Plane Crazy, had its first preview screening. The film marked a significant turning point for Walt Disney as it was the last time he had to work alongside another studio. Walt Disney made 26 films with Oswald . as the central character for Universal Pictures before taking the . character to his own studio and turning it into a rodent. Phenomenon: Mickey Mouse, pictured here as the sorcerer's apprentice in Fantasia (1940), went on to become an enduring, international sensation . Mrs Huntley said: 'It is significant because it is Disney but also because the character was the prototype of Mickey Mouse. 'Disney . developed many characters and they changed over time and Oswald has the . characteristics of Mickey Mouse - he looks similar even though he's a . rabbit. 'Disney made a series with this character and then turned him into a mouse. 'Mickey Mouse has lasted over 80 years and many generations have grown up to love him. 'How we ended up with the film I don't know. It was probably collected by my father who started the company and it has been sitting on our shelves for decades. 'We have decided to sell it because it is not really what we specialise in and we can use the money to preserve other films we have.' Stephanie Connell, from Bonhams, said: 'Hungry Hobos is an incredible find, a lost masterpiece and a cartoon with a unique and vital place in animation history.' The film comprises of a 16mm double perforated celluloid acetate positive print. It is being auctioned on December 14.

Meanwhile, in an unrelated announcement, the Vatican has given its blessing to exorcisms as a standard practise in the Catholic Church.

The association was introduced in Italy by veteran exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, to share experience as increased interest in occult practices has boosted demand for exorcisms. Fr. Francesco Bamonte, an exorcist from the Diocese of Rome told official Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano that the Holy See’s approval of the IAE 'is cause for joy... for the church as a whole.'

"A mother who claimed her three-year-old daughter was killed in a hit and run incident outside their Florida home has been charged with murder.

Yeliani was also described as being malnourished and both she and her two-year-old brother, who is now in protective custody, were covered in bruises. Arrested: Maryann Schwartz has been charged with murder over the death of her three-year-old daughter . Claims: Schwartz, pictured left in court, told police her daughter was run over and killed by an unknown vehicle . Schwartz had been arrested on Wednesday over child abuse charges relating to her son, but the first-degree murder charge in connection with Yeliani's death was added late last night. The 22-year-old had told police she didn't see her daughter get run over, but claimed that Yeliani had been hit by a vehicle at about 9.30pm on Friday. She called 911 while on her way to the hospital, and was told to pull over and wait for emergency responders. When her daughter was examined at hospital however, doctors said her body was too cold to have fitted with the mother's time frame of events. Highway patrol officers became suspicious of her story, and detectives brought in to work on the case said Yeliani had died in 'suspicious circumstances', according to an incident report seen by the Orlando Sentinel. A report by a medical examiner found the child had died from blunt-force trauma, but it was unable to confirm if the injuries came from being hit by a car. Charges: Schwartz, center, was originally arrested for child after bruises were seen on her surviving child . Schwartz's son was put into protective custody, and three children belonging to her housemate, Vanessa Morales, were put in the care of a relative after police searched the apartment the women shared. 'There were bruises on the children that concerned us and led us to think there was possible physical abuse that occurred,' Kristin Gray, of the Department for Children and Families, said. Hospital staff had contacted the sheriff's department to say Schwartz's son had 'multiple bruises on his body that were not consistent with normal child activities', Local 6 reported. Morales, who is currently allowed only supervised visits with her children, was arrested on Wednesday for unrelated charges after allegedly driving on a suspended license.","Doctors claim girl's body was too cold to have died when Maryann Schwartz said she did .

'The derbies between Villa and West Brom that I've been involved in have always been really good games with lots of goals in them and I don't think this one will be any different.

"Departed: Jo Shuter has resigned as headmistress a week after a report into her spending at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy was published . A ‘super head' who spent more than £30,000 of public funds on extravagant parties and hotel rooms, today quit after months of speculation about her conduct. A report on Jo Shuter's behaviour released last week is said to have made her position 'untenable'. The report said the former head teacher . of the year, who was honoured with a CBE in 2010, failed to ‘avoid waste . and extravagance’ and funding for the school’s 1,400 pupils, aged 11 to . 19, was ‘diverted for inappropriate purposes’. According to the Camden New Journal, Miss Shuter has resigned despite being reinstated to her post with just a written warning a week ago. The head was suspended last September from the Swiss Cottage school over allegations of financial irregularity. She today said: 'It is with sadness and regret that I . have taken the difficult decision to tender my resignation. 'My 11 years of headship have been a . source of pride and happiness.' Patrick Lees, chairman of the school's governing body, said: 'Whilst we . as the governing body have reinstated Jo, following the publication of . the EFA report last week Jo felt her position at QK had become . untenable.' Miss Shuter, of Dollis Hill, West London, spent almost £7,000 of school funds on her 50th birthday party. She blew £6,957.49 on food and alcohol, special lights, landscaping, chair covers, flowers and paying workers. Staff at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in north-west London also spent tens of thousands on taxis, flowers and luxury hotels in less than two years. Some money has now been paid back, and the cost of the party was refunded in full – a year later. Decorated: Ms Shuter, pictured here meeting Tony Blair in 2006, was honoured with a CBE in 2010 . The report by the Department for . Education’s internal audit unit says Miss Shuter, named head teacher of . the year in 2007, failed to be ‘economical’ with public funds. It . downgrades the school’s  financial self-assessment from ‘good’ to . ‘inadequate’, citing  two Government investigations between January 1, . 2011 and August 31, 2012, which found: . The report said Miss Shuter was . expected to ‘avoid waste and extravagance’ and take personal . responsibility for the ‘propriety and regularity’ of public funds. It adds: ‘Clearly those . responsibilities have not been discharged by Ms Shuter and proper . financial control has not been exercised.’ Consultancy: Ms Shuter was paid up to £15,000 for her advice by other councils while she was on school time . Turnaround: Quintin Kynaston had been failing in 2001, but Ms Shuter transformed the school, being awarded two 'Outstanding' Ofsted reports . The school has been issued a financial notice to improve –  including recovering payments. A DfE spokesman said: ‘The misuse of public money  meant for schools is completely unacceptable. ‘We are monitoring the situation closely and will take any further action necessary.’ A Metropolitan Police investigation into allegations of fraud and false accounting is ongoing.

"Nicole had become dependent on sugar . Two . years ago, I was overweight, unhappy, stressed out and moody with spots . and bad habits. And I was exhausted and often felt ill. The cause? I'd become dependent on sugar: hopelessly, chemically and emotionally dependent on it. So, . I stopped eating sugar-rich foods. That included not only the obvious . culprits, but all processed food, alcohol, anything made from refined . wheat (bread and pasta) and potatoes. Admittedly, the first week was . tough. But once your larder is restocked with nuts, oatcakes and kale . chips, you no longer miss that bar of chocolate you used to have every . afternoon. But what if your neighbour buys you a box of chocolates and then sits down with you to share them over a cup of tea? Or . what if you go to a friend's house and she's made pulled pork - a dish . that's marinated in sticky sugars - served in white bread buns with a . sweet barbecue sauce and chips? Do you tell her you can't eat it, . then munch through your emergency packet of oatcakes while everyone else . is tucking in to dinner? I've learned how to deal with these situations - and here's how you can, too. Most . of my friends know I no longer eat sugar and cater accordingly. However, if I'm invited to dinner, I never remind them or ask what . they're going to cook. I don't want to be neurotic and controlling, . so I normally eat what I'm given. It's not the end of the world if it's . not low in sugar. And home-made food is usually fine. If I'm asked beforehand if there's anything I don't eat, I say I don't have a sweet tooth, so I'm not keen on puddings. Sometimes . I take a selection of cheese with oatcakes, which the hostess can whip . out at dessert time. This ensures I have something on my plate while all . the other guests are oohing and aahing over their chocolate torte. I also bring fizzy water to drink instead of alcohol. Fruit is incredibly high in sugar, so don't overdose on it. Most of your five a day should come from vegetables. Fill your fruit bowl with avocados, lemons and limes. The . occasional helping of antioxidant-rich dark berries (blueberries and . blackberries) is OK, as these contain less sugar than other fruit. You could eat cheese with oatcakes after dinner, and most of your five a day should come from veg . Soon after I gave up sugar, I stopped at a service station to buy a snack, but there was nothing I could have! There . wasn't even plain water - only Volvic Touch Of Fruit Lemon And Lime . flavoured water, which has 27g of sugar in a 500ml bottle. That's the equivalent of 7 tsp of sugar or three Krispy  Kreme doughnuts. The . other day, I was catching a train from Victoria in London and searched . in vain for something I could eat in the station shops among all the . doughnuts, sweets, sandwiches, cupcakes and sushi (it's sugar that makes . the rice sticky). I had to go outside the station to a nearby . branch of Pret a Manger and grab a bag of  their tasty (and, at £1.50, . pricey) kale chips. The worst places for a sugar-free snack are newsagents, with their rows of chocolates, sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks. Airports aren't much better. Obviously, alcohol is out, so I drink fizzy water on the plane or spicy tomato juice. If . it's a short-haul flight, I never eat the meal that's served. Usually . it's a processed, salty, squidgy mess that isn't really worth its . calories. Instead, I stop off at a Marks & Spencer's Simply Food . outlet and buy carrot and celery batons with hummus or bags of nuts and . wasabi peas. If you'd like to indulge, go for a glass of red wine and sip it slowly . Alcohol . is full of sugar. If you must have a drink, try vodka - which is low in . sugar - with soda and a squeeze of lime for flavour. But beware! Six weeks after giving up sugar, I felt light-headed after just two sips! At a dinner party, if you'd really like to indulge, go for a glass of red wine and sip it slowly. Wine is lower in sugar than many types of beer, so it's a better choice. If you live or work in a big city . there's a lot of choice for lunch. At the canteen salad bar, a sandwich . chain, a little independent place or a health-food eatery, you're bound . to find a selection of low-sugar meals. But if you're trying to . follow a low-sugar plan in rural Derbyshire or the Pennines, you should . probably put together a packed lunch. The easiest way to do this is . to make a bit extra of what you ate the night before, then freeze it or . put it in the fridge for lunch later in the week. Otherwise, soups are great (but check the label for sugar), as are salads. If you want sandwiches, avoid processed white or brown bread and opt for breads made from spelt, rye or amaranth. And good old oatcakes can be topped with smoked salmon, hummus, avocado or beetroot. You can also take a little pot of full-fat natural yogurt into work to round off your meal. The body often misinterprets dehydration as hunger . IN . MY drawer at work, I always have oatcakes, unsalted nuts and a jar of . ground cinnamon to provide an instant flavour hit to coffee, porridge or . yogurt. Choose organic corn chips - think Doritos, but without all . the artificial flavourings. Get plain if you can, lightly salted if you . have to. Only eat snacks when you're hungry, not when you're bored. It's best to drink a glass of water first - the body often misinterprets . dehydration as hunger - and then see if you still feel hungry. Bear in mind a few key rules when eating out: . ■ . Shy away from sauces. The more gloopy the sauce, the more likely it is . to be packed with sugar. Hoisin or black bean are prime examples.■ Avoid the bread basket. If you're super hungry, have a few nuts before you go out.■ Puddings are a no-no. Have cheese or do without. Most are high in sugar. For an Indian takeaway, I order dry chicken tikka with raita (cucumber or mint yogurt). If . your local doesn't deliver brown rice, stick some on the stove when you . order and it should be ready by the time the meal arrives. At a Chinese takeaway, choose a veggie dish with as little sauce as possible. Pizzas . from big chains are often high in fat, wheat (the body converts this to . sugar faster than any other grain) and salt, so should be avoided.

STEAK HOUSES, FRENCH RESTAURANTS AND GRILLS . There's nearly always something you can eat - a grilled fillet steak with spinach or a salad, for example. FISH . MY favourite option. Order poached or grilled fish, but avoid creamy sauces. ASIAN . Stir-fries . with little or no sauce are fine, but Thai, Chinese, Indonesian and . Malaysian food tends to be sweet. Choose a dry rice dish or  sauteed . veggies. BURGER JOINTS . Cut the bun - and go easy on the ketchup and mayonnaise. JAPANESE . One . of the worst options is sushi (because of the sugary white rice), so go . for sashimi - thin slices of fish - and ask for brown rice on the side. ITALIAN . Pizza, pasta and white rice are high on the glycaemic index, which means they quickly turn to sugar inside the body. However, . many Italians do grilled meat or fish and salads. Otherwise, opt for . pasta with a light vongole (clams) sauce and get back to your low-sugar . regimen in the morning.","Nicole Mowbray stopped eating sugar-rich and processed food, and alcohol .

"He'll be nine months old tomorrow and Prince George is already getting his teeth – all three of them – into his royal duties. The infant was keen to nibble anything he could get his little hands on during a visit to Taronga Zoo in Sydney yesterday with his parents. After his attempt to grab a bilby – a native Australian marsupial – was thwarted, he settled for enthusiastically chewing a car sticker reading ‘Wild child on board’. Scroll down for video . Getting bigger by the day: George currently has three teeth showing, two at the bottom and one at the top . Show us a smile! Prince William says George is restless at night as his teeth start to push through . What a face! Prince George pulls an adorable expression whilst being carried by his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, during a visit to Sydney's Taronga Zoo in Australia . Bundle of joy: Prince George seems to be yawning whilst mother Kate proudly holds him at their zoo visit . ‘Munch, munch, munch,’ laughed Prince William, who suggested that teething George had caused his parents sleepless nights. He . said his son had been ‘wreaking havoc’ at night at Admiralty House, the . royals’ base during the Sydney leg of their tour Down Under. William, . 31, said: ‘I’ve been a bit concerned – he is destroying everything.’ Kate also described George as ‘cute and very noisy’ to well-wishers. The . zoo visit was George’s second ever public engagement and he was clearly . excited to be introduced to the bilby, one of Australia’s best-loved . and most endangered species. Not as well known as the kangaroo, bilbies . are nonetheless something of a national treasure – many Australians give . chocolate bilbies at Easter instead of bunnies or eggs. What are you looking at? Gorgeous Prince George met a bilby names after him, as William and Kate officially opened the Prince George Bilby Exhibit . Looking good! The young Royal, Prince George  has been scored 5.5 out of 10 in 'attractiveness' by Anaface, a higher number than both his father and grandfather . But . as far as the little prince was concerned, he was just a funny looking . creature with a long tail that was perfect for pulling. The . animal was originally called Boy but has been renamed after the future . king. Wriggling his arms and legs in excitement, George (the human one) squealed and gurgled when he spotted his namesake. His . parents took it in turns to hold him in their arms and to support him . standing up, restraining him as he tried to climb into the enclosure. For me? George reaches out to grab the toy bilby, a gift from the zoo . I'm bored now: After a few moments he throws it to the ground . To the rescue: Kate laughs as she picks up the cuddly toy . That's more like it! Babies tend to chew on things to lessen the pain while teething and George was keen to nibble anything he could get his little hands on during his zoo visit . ‘He’s . trying to grab his ear,’ said Kate, 32. ‘If he gets it he’ll never let . go,’ added William. As the keeper went to coax the bilby closer to . George, Kate stopped him, saying: ‘He’s got quite a strong grab . actually.’ George took a . dimmer view of a toy bilby he was presented with by the zoo, chucking it . aside – to the embarrassment of his mother, who scrambled to pick it . up. Kate was wearing a . primrose yellow broderie anglaise dress which she previously wore during . the Jubilee Tour of 2012 in the Solomon Islands, with Stuart Weitzman . Minx wedges and Kiki McDonough citrine drop earrings. George wore a striped jersey polo and matching £55 pocket shorts, both by designer Rachel Riley. And George's good looks have even been rated by a 'facial beauty analyst test.' What's this? George is fascinated by the bilby, a small marsupial . Still looks cute: Prince George scrunches up his face and still manages to look adorable . The online test, by Anaface.com, rates 'attractiveness' based on the geometry of a face, and has scored George 5.5 out of 10. If . you think the results don't quite do the Prince justice, fear not. There's no scientific evidence to support these 'findings,' though they . do at least mark young George higher than both his father and . grandfather, Prince Charles, as youngsters. William rated 5.07 in the test, whilst the Prince of Wales as a baby scored just 0.97. The test rates attractiveness by measuring 17 'key points' on the face based on symmetry and  proportion. It would seem beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. Beauty by numbers: Prince George has been rated 5.5 out of 10 by  Facial Beauty Analysis website Anaface .

"A woman beaten by a California Highway Patrol officer after walking barefoot along a freeway will receive $1.5million under a settlement reached Wednesday night. The punches thrown at Marlene Pinnock were filmed by a passing motorist, leading to the settlement as well as the decision by the officer, Daniel Andrew, to resign. CHP Commissioner Joe Farrow confirmed the settlement in an emailed statement and an attorney for Marlene Pinnock confirmed the dollar amount for The Associated Press. Scroll down for video . On tape: Motorist David Diaz recorded a video of Officer Daniel Andrew beating Marlene Pinnock after confronting her while she walked barefoot on the side of the road . 'When this incident occurred, I promised that I would look into it and vowed a swift resolution,' Farrow's statement said. 'Today, we have worked constructively to reach a settlement agreement that is satisfactory to all parties involved.' Andrew joined the CHP in 2012 and has been on paid administrative leave since the incident. Farrow says he 'has elected to resign,' though he could still be charged criminally. The CHP forwarded the results of its investigation of the incident to Los Angeles County prosecutors last month, saying he could face serious charges but none have been filed yet. The bulk of the settlement will take the form of a special needs trust for Pinnock, the CHP said. Pinnock's attorney Caree Harper said the settlement fulfilled the two elements her side was looking for. 'One of the things we wanted to make sure of was that she was provided for in a manner that accommodated her unique situation in life,' Harper said, 'and that the officer was not going to be an officer anymore and we secured those things.' Settled: Marlene Pinnock reached a settlement with California Highway Patrol and the officer agreed to resign after beating her on the side of the highway . The July 1 video of Andrew punching Pinnock was captured by a passing driver and spread widely on the internet and television. According to a search warrant made public in court documents last month, Andrew had just pulled Pinnock from oncoming traffic and she resisted by pushing him. Multiple drivers called 911 to report her walking barefoot along the side of the freeway. Andrew then straddled her on the ground as Pinnock resisted by 'kicking her legs, grabbing the officer's uniform and twisting her body,' the warrant said. Andrew 'struck her in the upper torso and head several times with a closed right fist,' the records say. The warrant said Pinnock suffered no signs of physical injury and refused medical treatment. She was placed on a psychiatric hold for two weeks. Pinnock has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been off her medication for two to three months before the altercation. In an interview with the AP last month, Pinnock said she believed the officer was trying to kill her. 'He grabbed me, he threw me down, he started beating me,' she said. 'I felt like he was trying to kill me, beat me to death.'","Marlene Pinnock suffers from bipolar disorder and had been off her medication for several months when she was spotted walking along the freeway .

"The recent spate of White House fence jumpers represents just a fraction of the total number of people who breached barricades at the White House throughout the last five years, the Secret Service says. A total of 40 people have illegally crossed into restricted areas outside the White House in fiscal years 2009 through 2014 the agency told Congress on Friday, according to The Washington Examiner. That's more than twice as many as ex-Secret Service Director Julia Pierson intimated in testimony before Congress in late September. Scroll down for video . This September 29 photo depicts an extra layer of barricades outside the White House that was set up after fence-jumper Omar Gonzalez was revealed to have forged deeper into the government building than what it was previously reported . A total of 40 people have illegally crossed into restricted areas outside the White House in fiscal years 2009 through 2014 the Secret Service reportedly told Congress on Friday . And that number doesn't include the seven people who made it into restricted areas inside the White House, including party crashing Real Housewives of D.C. stars Tareq and Michaele Salahi, the Examiner's report claims. Of the 40 barrier-jumping incidents that the Secret Service says occurred, just 10 involved individuals hopping the permanent fencing outside the White House, acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a letter on Friday. The other 30 bypassed temporary blockades surrounding the complex such as police tape or movable metal barricades. The Examiner says most of those people were under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both. Several claimed to taking a shortcut to the D.C. Metro and a handful of others were out of towners who reportedly told police they didn't realize they were breaking the law. Still the Secret Service arrests all but two of those individuals, the Examiner says. One law-breaker violated a barrier to get a 'better view of the White House.' Two scaled Treasury to 'better display their signs during an anti-war demonstration.' A more serious breach in 2010 involved a person 'rambling religious references' and having 'hallucinations' as he charged the White House, threatening to assassinate the president. On Independence Day in 2011 a man dressed up as Uncle Sam skirted a barrier at Blair House after having proclaimed at the White House earlier that day that the president owed him a significant amount of money. Also included in the Secret Service's report to Congress, according to the Examiner, is a February 2013 episode in which a mentally ill man ignored security measures and stormed the White House trying to validate the president's existence. 'He believed he was no longer a real person and felt that the president possessed the ability to reinstate him,' the report stated. Of the 40 incident, 30 bypassed temporary blockades surrounding the complex such as police tape or movable metal barricades like the ones seen here in front of the White House on September 22 . Four individuals have jumped the permanent fencing at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave this year alone. That number does not include mentally ill man, Dominic Adesanya, who assaulted two dogs on the White House lawn. Because that episode took place in October, after the end of the 2014 fiscal year, it will be counted as part of next year's stats . Just this year four people made it over the permanent barrier outside of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and onto the lawn of the White House. That includes Omar Gonzales - the man who evaded multiple security officers and ran through the government building until he was tackled by an off-duty agent - but not the  mentally ill man, Dominic Adesanya, who assaulted two dogs while attempting to make his way into the building several weeks ago. Because that episode took place in October, it will be counted as part of next year's stats. The government fiscal year ends on September 30, therefore the Secret Service report only includes incidents through that date. The other three instances this year occurred in March, July and September. Few details were released at the time about the March 30 intrusion other than to confirm that it happened and charges were being pressed against the unidentified male jumper. The Examiner says that he was stopped by a K-9 unit, however, and was subsequently treated at a hospital. The news publication says that another mentally ill man jumped the fence sometime in July in hopes of giving his musical recordings to the president. He was arrested and ordered not to return to the premises. In September two men, Gonzales, and a hardcore Pokemon fan scaled the White House fencing. The affair with Gonzales took place on September 19. The other intrusion came days prior on September 11. White House reporters who witnessed the first incident snapped photos of Secret Service tackling a man wearing a yellow hat bearing the image of Pokemon character Pikachu. He was also carrying a stuffed replica of video game character. The report obtained by the Washington Examiner and released on Monday night calls into question the congressional testimony of former Secret Service Director Pierson, who told a committee during a September 30 hearing that 16 people had jumped the fence since the fall of 2009. 'In addition to fence-jumpers, over the last five years hundreds of individuals have approached the White House perimeter, verbalizing threats to our protectees or acting in a suspicious manner,' Pierson said that the time. 'Officers and agents routinely leverage their experience and training to make decisions to either arrest or transfer these individuals to appropriate facilities for mental health evaluations.' Pierson, who resigned the following day amid intense political pressure, did not detail every incident she considered to be a true barricade breach. However, the numbers provided in her testimony do not align with the Secret Service's latest report to Congress in which the agency listed 40 cases of barrier-jumping.","That's more than twice as many as ex-Secret Service Director Julia Pierson intimated in testimony before Congress in late September .

"Visit: Martin McGuinness will sit down with Fiona Woolf, the ceremonial leader of the City of London, at a banquet in the Guildhall - just a few hundred yards from the sites of two massive attacks during the 1990s . Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness will be wined and dined by the Lord Mayor of London this week - despite the trail of devastation wrought in the Square Mile by Irish republicans. He will sit down with Fiona Woolf, the ceremonial leader of the City of London, at a banquet in the Guildhall - just a few hundred yards from the sites of two massive attacks during the 1990s. The dinner will take place half a mile from the atrocities - the Baltic Exchange in 1992 and Bishopsgate in 1993 - which caused hundreds of millions of pounds of damage and killed four people. The invitation was accepted by Mr McGuinness as controversy rages over his decision to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle with the Queen. The events are part of a four-day state visit of Irish president Michael D Higgins - the first ever by an Irish head of state - starting tomorrow (Tues). Mr McGuinness is Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister and represents Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. He first met the Queen two years ago at a jubilee event in Belfast, when he shook hands with her both in public and in private. However the former MP, who refused to sit in the House of Commons because of an oath of allegiance to the monarch, had snubbed a gala banquet in her honour at Dublin Castle during a ground-breaking trip to the Irish Republic in 2011. But he has now decided to attend a similar event at Windsor Castle next week - as well as being a guest of the Lord Mayor of London, the ceremonial head of the City of London, London’s financial district. Three major bombs exploded in the Square Mile during the Troubles, including a 1990 bomb at the Stock Exchange. Atrocity: The site of the bombing which took place at the Baltic Exchange in 1992. The picture was taken just days after the blast . Last night Lord Tebbit, who was injured in the 1984 Brighton bomb which left his wife Margaret in a wheelchair, said: ‘I imagine that most people in the City will not be unduly pleased.’ But he said that neither the Queen not the Lord Mayor had control over who was invited to these sorts of banquets - that was down to diplomats. Prince Philip’s uncle, Lord Mounbatten of Burma, was assassinated by an IRA bomb planted in his fishing boat in 1979. ‘Mr McGuinness is there on the coat tails of the Irish ambassador - it’s up to him whose company he chooses to keep,’ said the former Tory party chairman. ‘It makes it very difficult for the Palace and for the Lord Mayor. Mr McGuinness owns up to being a member of a terrorist organisation, those who suffered at the hands of the terrorists are not best pleased. ‘The Queen no choice in matter; she can hardly refuse to invite the Irish ambassador. I imagine it is difficult for her - her family has suffered at the hands of the IRA.’ He added: ‘There’s always the possibility that a member of the Real IRA will be so outraged by Mr McGuinness bowing to the Queen that they might shoot him in the back for it. We can but hope.’ Controversial visit: The invitation was accepted by Mr McGuinness as controversy rages over his decision to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle with the Queen, who he shook hands with in 2012 . In a statement, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: ‘Sinn Fein seeks a new and positive relationship between Ireland - all of Ireland - and Britain based on equality and mutual respect for the first time in our troubled history. ‘We also seek an agreed, united Ireland which accommodates those who define themselves as British. It is within this context that I can confirm that Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness will accept an invitation to attend all events as part of the state visit.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘There is a long-standing practice of not commenting on individual invitations. That said, Her Majesty is greatly looking forward to this historic state visit and welcoming all guests to Windsor Castle.’ Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘Whilst the man concerned has engaged in things in the past which have created appalling mayhem and tragedy, today we are looking at healing those rifts. ‘But would I want to sit beside him at dinner? No, I certainly would not.’ Highlights of the visit will include an address the president will make to both Houses of Parliament - another first for an Irish head of state. Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina will also visit the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.","Sinn Fein politician will sit down with Fiona Woolf at the Guildhall .

"Israel has become the world's largest Jewish population centre, overtaking America for the first time. The total Jewish population of six million in the country carries added significance, as this was the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust. Census statistics revealed that Israel's total population has reached eight million, with the surge in the Jewish community thought to have been fuelled by returning members of the diaspora. Growth: Israel's Interior Ministry said that the country's Jewish population had exceeded six million for the first time, overtaking America, which is home to 5.5million Jews . In comparison, America is home to 5.5.million Jews, with two million thought to live in New York alone. Comparatively, half a million live in France and approximately 290,000 reside in the UK. The census figures, announced during the Passover holiday, revealed that the Israel is also home to 1.6million Arabs. The minority also includes 350,000 non-Arab Christians and another group, members of which have not listed a religion. Despite the rise in Israel's Jewish population, experts said that the population of those belonging to the religious group is declining on a global scale. Before the Holocaust, the global Jewish population was estimated at 18 million, whereas now it is believed to be 13.8million. Professor Sergio Della Pergola, from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said: 'Israel has indeed experienced a growth . in the number of Jews last year, but world Jewry outside Israel did not . fare so well. The census figures, announced during the Passover holiday, revealed that the Israel is also home to 1.6million Arabs . 'On the contrary, world Jewry has experienced negative . growth.' Israeli historian Tom Segev told the Daily Telegraph: 'Six million is absolutely a symbolic number but still most Jews live outside Israel. 'But within five, seven or 10 years, you might be able to say that most Jews in the world live inside Israel and it will be legitimate to use the cliché that for the first time in 2,000 years, the Jews are in Israel. 'Then the question will be, what do you do with the Zionist ideology?' A significant part of Israel's population growth is thought to have centred on Tel Aviv. A recent report in Haaretz newspaper suggested that 80 percent of Israel’s population will live within the city's greater area bu 2025.","Total Jewish population of Israel exceeded six million according to census .

"A British photographer has given a unique glimpse into what actually makes the internet run. British artist and designer Timo Arnall was given unprecedented access to the usually secret and highly secure data centres behind many of the world's biggest online services. Spanish phone firm Telefónica's 65,700 square meter data center in Alcalá, Spain, one of the biggest in Europe. Scroll down for video . Arnall said that after being led through layers of identification and security far higher than any airport, he found the inner sanctums - the server rooms. He described them as: 'deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers. In these spaces you are buffeted by hot and cold air that blusters through everything.' Located in the town of Alcala de Henares, near Madrid, the centre includes 23 IT rooms and a built area of 65,700 square meters. Each module of the data centre will be independent, allowing new rooms to be activated without affecting the operation of the rest. Similarly, the 1,200 kW of IT power for each room can be multiplied up to fourfold without impacting the housed systems. The vast building costs €300 million according to Telefónica. The pictures were taken alongside a high definition film Timo is set to show in Barcelona on three giant screens which wrap around visitors to give them a sense of the scale of the building. The vast building costs €300 million according to Telefónica. Located in the town of Alcala de Henares, near Madrid, the centre includes 23 IT rooms and a built area of 65,700 square meters. Each module of the data centre will be independent, allowing new rooms to be activated without affecting the operation of the rest. Similarly, the 1,200 kW of IT power for each room can be multiplied up to fourfold without impacting the housed systems. 'Internet machine documents one of the largest, most secure and ‘fault-tolerant’ data-centres in the world, run by Telefonica in Alcalá, Spain,' Arnall said. 'The film explores these hidden architectures with a wide, slowly moving camera. 'The subtle changes in perspective encourage contemplative reflection on the spaces where internet data and connectivity are being managed.' Power to keep the servers running  is supplied not only through the mains, but backed up with warm caverns of lead batteries, managed by gently buzzing cabinets of relays and switches, said Arnall. Server rooms are kept cool through corridors that divide the huge space. There are fibre optic connections routed through multiple, redundant, paths across the building. In the basement, these cables connect to the wider internet through holes in rough concrete walls. Arnall said he hoped the film would allow people to see 'the loud' as a more physical object. 'In this film I wanted to look beyond the childish myth of ‘the cloud’, to investigate what the infrastructures of the internet actually look like. 'It felt important to be able to see and hear the energy that goes into powering these machines, and the associated systems for securing, cooling and maintaining them.' 'What we find, after being led through layers of identification and security far higher than any airport, are deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers,' said Arnall. Power is supplied not only through the mains, but backed up with lead batteries. In turn these are backed up in turn by rows of yellow generators so that the data centre can run indefinitely until power returns. Giant stainless steel water tanks, containing tens of thousands of litres of cool water, are positioned outside in case of fire, while the roof has a football-pitch sized array of ‘chillers’ that filter and cool the air going into the building. Rows of yellow generators with diesel storage tanks. The centre has contracts with fuel supply companies so it can run indefinitely in the even of a power failure. Walls are fitted with special mountings so racks or servers and the equipment needed to control and monitor them can be fitted. A server room waiting to be filled: Arnall said he wandered the halls for miles, and said the server rooms felt like 'entering an intensive care unit at a hospital.'","Photographer Timo Arnall given unique access to Telefónica's 65,700 square meter data center in Alcalá, Spain .

"Had the Queen been watching Italy’s defeat to Costa Rica she would have been unimpressed by Mario Balotelli. Before the game, knowing that an Italy win would boost England’s slim chances of advancing from Group D, Balotelli tweeted: ‘If we beat Costa Rica I want a kiss, obviously on the cheek, from the UK Queen.' The former Manchester City forward led the Italian line brilliantly in their 2-1 win over England on Saturday in Manaus, but he was abject against Costa Rica, fluffing two decent chances in the first half and offering little after the break.

Against Costa Rica in Recife, we saw the player that angered Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan and fell out of favour at the Etihad before being shipped back to the San Siro to play for AC Milan. Balotelli barely touched the ball in the opening 20 minutes, as Costa Rica defenders Giancarlo Gonzalez and Oscar Duarte did a fine job of reading his runs and dispossessing him whenever he looked like threatening. In the 31st minute he spurned a great chance to put Italy ahead, after racing on to a glorious first-time pass from Andrea Pirlo. Balotelli’s first touch was heavy which meant he had to stretch to try and prod a lob over Keylor Navas. The ball cleared the goalkeeper but drifted some way wide of the left-hand post.

In the 69th minute he received the first booking of the game, for pulling the shirt of Duarte after an Italy move broke down. There was no need for it, and it merely disrupted Italy’s flow as they went in search of an equaliser. Costa Rica, to their credit, were magnificent.

"The taxman is to target children with alarmist videos warning them to pay their bills when they grow up. A film depicting HM Revenue & Customs staff chasing ‘ghosts’ – unseen tax cheats who hide billions from the Treasury – will be screened to 14 to 17-year-olds from next month in new classes on personal finance and how to contribute to society. But James Daley, of the Fairer Finance consumer group, said: ‘Some personal finance education in schools is very useful, but trying to brainwash children into paying their tax isn’t the right way of going about it.’ HM Revenue & Customs is to target children with new alarmist videos warning them to pay their tax bills . The animation portrays tax inspectors as ‘ghostbusters’ hunting spooks who fail to declare money from their jobs and moonlighting workers who only pay tax on one income. After a successful chase, it ends with the tax evaders in jail. Officials are relying on greater influence in schools as well as their traditional enforcement activities to crack down on tax evasion, which represents a loss of £36billion to the UK each year. Jennie Granger, of HMRC, said: ‘Educating young people so they don’t get tempted is vital. We are very proud this film is part of the national curriculum.’ Critics suggested HMRC should focus on catching tax evaders rather than lecturing pupils. Anastasia de Waal, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘The reason people don’t pay their taxes is down to loopholes and inefficiencies. Better education will help, but there are much better ways of doing it than this.’ In its fight to narrow the tax gap, schools are set to become a new battlefront for HMRC. For the first time, financial education is now part of the compulsory National Curriculum. Introduced in September, it forms part of Citizenship classes for 11-16-year-olds and maths for 5-14-year-olds. The tax video - to be launched officially next month - will be broadcast as part of these. The film will be screened to 14 to 17-year-olds from next month in new classes on personal finance and how to contribute to society (file picture) HMRC also offers other information guides for teachers to use – mainly in paper form - to use with pupils. These include games and tests on how to understand income tax and what your National Insurance contributions are used for. Two years ago, it was criticised for a teaching module which encouraged students to shop tax dodgers to their teachers. A teaching aid asked children if they could think of any activities in their local area where tax wasn’t being paid. HMRC did not say how much the new video cost but its fight against tax fraud and evasion has already seen it spend millions setting up regional taskforces to go after industries it believes are prone to tax evasion. These now include taxi drivers, restaurants, market stall owners and even Avon ladies. Its pursuit of non-payment has also raised fears it is delving too deeply into people’s financial affairs. HMRC is currently pushing for new powers to raid the bank accounts of those it says owe it tax. The headquarters of HMRC. The government department is currently pushing for new powers to raid the bank accounts of those it says owe tax . Around 17,000 people a year would have money seized under proposed debt recovery powers - without the need for HMRC to go to court.

It claims it will always ensure its targets have at least £5,000 left over after any raid on their accounts. But experts worry not enough safeguards will be put in place to protect innocent or vulnerable households from errors that leave them out of pocket.

"This adorable set of images shows a group of playful bear cubs frolicking in the trees as their mother takes a well-earned nap. British photographer Jules Cox, 44, snapped the brown bears chasing each other up tall pine trees, completely unaware they were being watched down the lens of a camera. At just a few months old, the youngsters were already able to climb right to the top of the tallest tree in the great Kainuu wilderness, in Finland. Meanwhile an exhausted mother bear snoozed on the ground below - and from the pictures of her offspring it is plain to see why she needs the rest. Peek-a-boo: One of the bear cubs is bathed in golden light as it pokes its head out from behind a pine tree in the wilderness of Kainuu, Finland . Race you to the top! British photographer Jules Cox captured the cubs, who are just a few months old, dashing to the top of a tree . Taking a well-earned nap: While the cubs clambered up the tall trees their mother took the chance to get some  sleep . Mr Cox, who has spent four seasons with the bears, saw them racing up the trees and hanging on to branches. The photographer, from Brighton, hid in the woods so he could catch the bears in their most natural form. He said: 'It was an amazing sight to see the cubs climbing the tree. 'They have amazing climbing skills even at such a young age. 'They are utterly fearless.' The 39 stone (250kg) mother looks at ease while resting because the wilderness, which borders Russia, is a safe-haven for bears. Please let me sleep: The bears' mother is woken up as her boisterous children start play-fighting at the bottom of the trees . Look at me mum: One of the playful cubs looks down at its mother and the other bears as it hauls its way up a tree . Up close and personal: Mr Cox, from Brighton, hid in the woods all day to take the perfect pictures of the bears in their natural environment . More than 95 per cent of Kainuu is wild forest, meaning the bears have very little contact with people. Mr Cox said: 'At last light a cub climbed up a tree in shadow. 'Further up, the tree was still bathed in beautiful light. I encouraged him like something out of a bear version of Poltergeist. 'Just as the cub reached the patch of light he decided to come back down again. Only for the cub to change his mind again and shin up the tree again into the most beautiful patch of red light. 'I could have hugged the little fellow had it not been for his 250kg mother watching close by.'","British photographer captures brown bear cubs frolicking in woods in Kainuu, Finland .

'It took several hours to complete, but I‚m very happy with the result, as are the local squirrels and birds!' Mrs Baker and 10 year-old grandson Charlie sat at the window watching, as the first grey squirrel confronted the foot-high nutty Dalek. 'The animal was very nervous to start with, but soon realised one of his favourite foods was on offer‚' she said. 'Once he knew the Dalek was not going to exterminate him, he started tucking in. Pigeons, robins, thrushes and blue tits followed quickly.' Mrs Baker said she had watched Doctor Who since it began in the sixties, first with her children, then with her grandchildren.

When they got back into it against Uruguay at 1-1 we had a chance to get a point and say “right, we’re ready for the last game” and they didn’t.’ And ITV pundit Patrick Vieira said: ‘You can't say that England have played badly over the 2 games.

"New country: Doug Leguin, 60, took over a Dallas neighborhood on Monday as he attempted to secede from the nation . A 60-year-old man terrorized an expensive Dallas neighborhood as he attempted to secede from the U.S. and start his own nation called 'Dougiestan'. It's still unclear what drew Doug Leguin, of Corinth, to the upscale neighborhood where he lured police with a fake 911 call reporting a fire. Leguin proceeded to shoot at responding officers, while a nanny and 8-year-old child holed up for protection in a nearby mansion. No one was injured in the incident, and Leguin was later apprehended and charged with seven counts of aggravated assault on a public servant. He remains held on $350,000 bail at the Dallas County Jail. The incident started to unfold Tuesday afternoon when Leguin's wife called police to report her husband missing. She said he hadn't gone to work and there was an AK-47, ammunition and several propane tanks missing from their garage. Police say Leguin first tried to enter a home on the 5500 block of North 40th Place, but the nanny who answered the door refused to let him in and went to find a safe place inside the home to hide with the 8-year-old girl in her care. Outside, Leguin called police himself to report a fire in the neighborhood where he had set several traps and propane tanks. He also flipped the home's American flag upside down. Attack: Leguin first tried to enter this mansion, but was refused by the nanny who answered the door. Instead, he camped out in a wooded area where he waited for officers to arrive . Shots fired: Leguin shot at seven responding officers while the nanny and the 8-year-old child she was looking after hid in the house . Once firefighters and police arrived, Leguin changed his story and told the dispatcher that he was seceding from the U.S. and forming his own country because he was frustrated with the current government. 'I'm Dougie Doug and I just seceded from the nation,' the caller said. 'I've seceded from the nation. This is now Dougiestan right here.' 'I'm pissed off at America. America is broke. It's got a sorry government, and the people won't vote,' he continued. He also said he was upset with the Dallas Police for 'shooting the mentally handicapped'. When asked if he had been diagnosed with anything, Leguin said 'a clear mind and a full heart'. He then threatened to shoot any police officer who came forward and even shot at a propane tank which exploded. Trap: Leguin set a fire to draw firefighters and police to the neighborhood . Explosion: The gunman blew up a propane tank, but no one was injured . Damage: A bullet hole is pictured on a vehicle from the shootout . Friends say Leguin works as a chandelier installer, which may explain why he chose the rich neighborhood on Monday. He was eventually arrested when police surrounded him in a wooded area adjacent to the house. They found Leguin in possession of 750 rounds of ammunition . According to friend Lee Bamburg, Leguin is a left-leaning libertarian who has struggled with health issues recently. 'He is not anti-government, he is not anti-American, and he wants you to start thinking and to stop letting other people think for you,' Bamburg told Fox Dallas/Forth Worth. 'I think he wants you to listen and go vote.' In custody: Leguin was later arrested after police surrounded him in a wooded area adjacent to the house . Victims: A still shows what appears to be the nanny and 8-year-old girl rescued in the incident . Bamburg says Leguin, a diabetic, had developed tremors in his hands recently which may have made his job stressful. He believes Leguin didn't intend to hurt anyone in the incident since he knows how to shoot a gun and would have shot someone if he wanted to. Bamburg says Leguin probably shot at the officers to 'prolong the situation'. Neighbors in Leguin's Corinth neighborhood were also shocked to hear the news. 'He is very grandparent-like,' neighbor Tosha Price told NBC. 'Passive, softspoken.'","Doug Leguin, 60, took over a rich Dallas neighborhood Monday afternoon .

"Senate Democrats are urging President Barack Obama to hold off on an immigration announcement until after Congress passes legislation to fund the government through next year. Members of the Democratic caucus in upper chamber are worried that imminent action by the president will provoke Republicans and derail debate on a critical spending bill, which must be enacted by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shut down. Democrats in the House, on the other hand, are pressing Obama to act without further delay, after having put an executive order protecting millions of illegal immigration on the back burner for several months already until after this month's midterm elections. The White House had not given any indication of when the president will go public with his plans other than to say that it will be sometime this year, again refusing to discuss the topic today. A 10-point plan leaked last week by Fox News revealed that he may do it as soon as this Friday, however. Scroll down for video . To act on immigration or not to act on immigration, that is the question before President Barack Obama this week. Senate Democrats want the president to wait until Congress has passed a spending bill that will keep the government's doors open through next year, while hardcore immigration advocates want him to act before the Thanksgiving holiday . It also detailed immigrant populations the president should consider shielding from removal proceedings, including parents of citizen children and illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, defined as age 16 and under, before 2010. All told, up to five million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely under Obama's executive order if he takes the actions outlined. The impending declaration sent shudders through Congress, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told Reuters it would be his preference for Obama to wait until after the government's fiscal house was in order. 'The president has said he’s going to do the executive action. The question is when. It’s up to him,' Reid said. 'But I’d like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it.' Reid has since backtracked, however, saying Monday night that 'it should be done now.' Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware told The Hill on Monday that he would like to see Obama postpone his adjustments to the immigration system even beyond the end of the legislative session. 'If I were the president, what I’d say to the Congress — House, Senate, Democrat or Republican — I’m going to give you a little bit of time and in the new Congress expect you to do something,' Carper said. Rather than making vague threats to Congress about the costs of inaction, Carper told the Hill Obama should set in stone a date for Republicans in the legislative branch to come to the table with their own reforms. If they don't meet it, he said, then Obama should proceed. 'I would say not the first month, maybe the first quarter' of the new Congress, he said. The notion of continued inaction is unacceptable to influential immigration groups and their partners in the House, however. 'Waiting doesn’t make sense,' Clarissa Martínez-De-Castro, a principal at the National Council of La Raza, told The Hill. 'This is about millions of American families who’ve been waiting for a very long time for something to be done,' she said. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, center, speaks alongside US military veterans, service members and immigration reform advocates, during a Nov. 12 press conference at the U.S. Capitol urging Obama to move forward with immigration reform as soon as possible . At a press conference last week that brought together immigration reform advocates and members of Congress, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer said, 'What the president needs to do is give immediate and significant relief to those families that are going to be wrenched apart and living in fear.' 'I will be proud to support the president of the United States in acting in a big, bold manner,' he announced. Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez also said the president needs to make a 'bold' and 'generous' statement in the coming days, especially with the holiday season just around the corner. 'I've always said that the blessings of Thanksgiving should be bountiful this year for millions of immigrants that have been waiting for the Congress to act,' Gutierrez said last Thursday on MSNBC. On Monday he implied that he may have insight into the president's plans, telling the cable network that he knows for a fact that the forthcoming proclamation is 'going to be big.' 'I don't want to say more than that. I've been, as you know, we've spoken before. I said it was going to be at least five million before. And it seems that that's going to be a number that we're looking at,' he told host Alex Wagner. 'Look, I cannot tell you any more than that.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not confirm on Tuesday if the president had even received the Department of Homeland Security's recommendations yet, let alone the existence of a detailed plan. Earnest also said the president didn't have very much time to work on the issue while he was in Asia last week but he plans to study it this week now that he is back in Washington. He did concede that the White House had weighed the pros and cons of waiting until after the spending fight, and said, 'I think the fact is you could provably argue this both ways.' The Obama spokesman said Republicans are 'well aware' that the president is going to act and his 'sense' therefore is that they will try to preemptively pass legislation trying to stop him, which Earnest said was 'unwarranted.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest refused to shed light today on Obama's anticipated immigration plans. He did however confirm that the White House was debating whether or not to wait until after the spending fight had concluded . If Republicans would just pass comprehensive immigration reform, he argued, the president could 'throw away' and planned executive actions. House Speaker John Boehner has stated time and time again that he will not bring the  bill passed in the Senate more than a year ago, to the floor of the House. He instead prefers to tackle problems with the immigration system one by one. In anticipation of the Obama's executive action, Republicans in the House and Senate have indeed focused their immigration efforts on schemes to block Obama through the legislative process. Among those, according to Politico, is a plan to bring an immigration bill to the floor next year, when the GOP has a larger share of seats in both chambers, that would enhance border security while requiring Obama to enforce existing immigration laws. Another pathway under consideration is passage a short term continuing resolution that would fund the government through the first quarter of next year until Republicans officially hold a majority of seats in Congress. The House may also decide to fund every department of the government through the end of fiscal year 2015 except the Department of Homeland Security, which it would give short-term funding to as a stop gap until newly elected Republicans are seated. Conservatives in the House and Senate favor a measure that fund the government while explicitly stating that Obama cannot use any of the money appropriated through it to support activities associated with his executive order, which would essentially freeze DHS' ability to implement it. Boehner said Thursday at a press conference that 'all options on the table,' however House Republicans have since clarified that a government shut down is off limits. As Sen. Rand Paul pointed out on Monday evening on Hannity, however, using the spending bill as a vehicle to outmaneuver Obama has its limitations. Even if Republicans recruited enough of their Democratic colleagues in the Senate to pass a bill tying the president's hands on immigration will land itself at the top of Obama's veto list. Taking Obama to court may be Republicans' only realistic avenue to stop him from authorizing his own rules in the next two years before he leaves office. 'I think with regard to immigration reform, he’s doing something that Congress has not instructed him to do and in fact has instructed him otherwise, so I think the Supreme Court would strike it down,' Paul stated. 'That takes a while, but that may be the only recourse short of a new president.'","Senate Democrats are urging Obama to hold off until after Congress passes legislation to fund the government through next year .

"James Rodriguez is a major doubt for Real Madrid's Club World Cup campaign after medical tests revealed he has injured a muscle in his right leg. Real, currently on an 18-game winning streak, confirmed in a statement that Rodriguez has a grade one muscle injury in his calf. The European champions did not indicate how long they expect Rodriguez to be out but coach Carlo Ancelotti said he hoped he could have his player back in time for a possible final of the Club World Cup on December 20.

"UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon has asked U2 frontman Bono to join the fight against Ebola - by putting on a concert to raise money to battle the virus. He made the plea as it was revealed a trust fund he launched to provide fast and flexible funding for the fight against Ebola has only $100,000 (£62,000) in the bank. The fund, which is part of a $1 billion (£620 million) UN appeal for humanitarian needs in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, is intended to provide fast and flexible funding to respond to the medical emergency. Bono to the rescue! UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon (left) asked U2 frontman Bono (right) to join the fight against Ebola - by putting on a concert to raise money to battle the virus . But as it became clear its funds would do little alone to stem the spread of the killer virus, Mr Ban revealed he was considering alternative measures. 'I would welcome any initiative taken by Mr. Bono or some other leaders around the world to join this campaign to mobilize funds and mobilize awareness to take urgent action all together and to show solidarity,' Ban said. It comes as it emerged UK Prime Minister David Cameron will use an EU summit in Brussels next week to push for more funding and assistance for the poverty-stricken countries on the frontline of the Ebola outbreak. And US Secretary of State John Kerry pleaded with diplomats on Friday to rush more money and supplies to battle Ebola in West Africa, calling it 'a real test of global citizenship.' The Royal Navy medical ship RFA Argus, with a fully-equipped 100-bed hospital on board, is setting sail from Cornwall to join the humanitarian effort and is due to reach West Africa by the end of the month with 225 military personnel from a total planned UK deployment of 750. British Army medics arrived in Sierra Leone yesterday to work at a UK-supported treatment centre, which has 12 of its 92 beds set aside for healthcare workers who risk infection while treating others. The World Health Organisation has reported a total of 8,997 cases of Ebola, including 4,493 deaths up to the end of October 12, the vast majority of them in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Premier League clubs have said their doctors will closely monitor players who are returning from African Nations Cup qualifiers. Mr Ban said last night that a 'huge and urgent global response' was needed and that countries which have 'the capacity' should provide funding now.' 'I believe that it is time that those other countries who really have the capacity, provide financial support and other logistical support,' said the UN Secretary General. 'This is quite serious. We need an urgent global response and support.' Some $20 million (£12.4 million) have been pledged to Mr Ban's trust fund, but only $100,000 has actually been received. A Liberian health worker gives medication to a young Ebola patient at a treatment centre in Monrovia. Some $20 million  have been pledged to Mr Ban's trust fund, but only $100,000 has actually been received . The wider UN appeal has received $376 million (£234 million) in pledges - about 38% of the amount sought - though some countries are also providing help directly to affected countries and humanitarian agencies. Mr Ban's predecessor as secretary general Kofi Annan has said he is 'bitterly disappointed' at the scale and speed of the international community's response to the crisis. 'If the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently,' Mr Annan told BBC2's Newsnight. 'In fact when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe. 'And yet we should have known that in this interconnected world it was only a matter of time. 'I point the finger of blame at the governments with capacity ... I think there's enough blame to go around.' The British and US governments are ramping up diplomatic efforts to get more money and resources from the international community to fight Ebola . Mr Cameron has urged other European countries to introduce Ebola screening regimes at airports, warning they 'must do more' to halt the spread of the killer disease. At Thursday's Cobra meeting the Prime Minister voiced doubts about the quality of protection in place in Europe, saying other governments should emulate the checks brought in by the UK. A Downing Street spokesman said the meeting heard that the chief medical officer still regarded the risk to the UK as 'low'. UK pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline is trying to fast-track a vaccine for Ebola. But the company's head of Ebola vaccine research said it would come too late for the current epidemic. Dr Ripley Ballou told BBC Radio 4's File on Four: 'To have a vaccine that people can use, you have to have the vaccine registered and it has to be manufactured on a scale that is consistent with the intended use. 'It is going to be well into next year if not the year beyond before we have that kind of level of manufacturing and the data that is necessary ... The vaccine is going to come too late for this epidemic.' US president Barack Obama has given the go-ahead to the Pentagon to call up reserve and National Guard troops if they are needed to help fight the disease in West Africa, and said he may appoint someone specifically to head America's response to the virus. The US has faced criticism after Amber Joy Vinson, a nurse with Ebola, was allowed to board a flight from Ohio to Texas despite telling officials she had a fever. Senator Kerry said the UN has raised barely a third of the $1billion needed for Ebola, and asked diplomats attending a State Department gathering on Friday for their nations to send more cash, trucks, helicopters, hospital equipment, generators and incinerators. 'Meeting this crisis is going to require that we draw on each other's collective experience and our collective capacities,' he said. 'No one country, no individual group of nations is going to resolve this problem by themselves. This is going to take a collective,  global response, all hands on deck.'","$20 million  pledged to Ban Ki-Moon's trust fund, but only $100,000  received .

"Julie Creffield is on a quest to prove that slim doesn't necessarily mean fit - and fat doesn't always equate to being unhealthy. Weighing 15st 7lb, Julie runs 5-10km four times a week, incorporating a longer run at weekends when training for a marathon. She's set up a website, 'The Fat Girls’ Guide to Running’, to help others to start running, whatever their size. Julie, pictured after completing a marathon, now regularly runs 10k  four or more times each week . Julie set up The Fat Girls' Guide to Running website which gives tips on how to start running if you are larger . Julie spoke to MailOnline about her mission to prove you don’t have to be slim to be fit. At age 23 and weighing 20st Julie, from Stratford, was unfit and living on diet of fast food, with a very active social life which saw her binge drinking several times a week. Working on the Olympic project, Julie felt she needed to make an effort with her health. ‘A a work colleague convinced me to take part in a 3k fun run. With absolutely no training, I almost died on the way round - not only due to the unusual strain on my body, but also from pure embarrassment when a young boy shouted “Run Fatty Run” as I passed him. ‘That shocked me into taking action and regaining control over my life. The following day I signed up for the London Triathlon, which I completed just three months later in a XL wetsuit that just about fitted my size 18 body.’ Despite this, Julie admits she made little real progress over the following six years, taking part in fitness events sporadically, with her party lifestyle and unhealthy diet preventing her from making any real strides in fitness or weight loss. At first, Julie's party lifestyle and unhealthy diet prevented her from making any real strides in fitness . It was a comment by a rude spectator ('Run, fatty, run') during a 3k fun run that sparked Julie's campaign to prove bigger women can - and should - run . Julie, who gave birth to her daughter in January last year, has now changed her diet and is working with a nutritionist to make sure she gets the proper sustenance for training. However she insists weight loss is in no way a goal. ‘I rarely drink alcohol now and my diet is much more balanced. I eat more proper foods and I’ve stopped eating ‘diet’ foods. ‘I cook much more food from scratch and snack more healthy on things like fruit and nuts. ‘Now I’m a mother I didn’t want to pass on unhealthy habits to my daughter. Julie's blog about running as a larger lady received thousands of hits, so set up her website 'The Fat Girls' Guide to Running' ‘I also want to be a good role model for people. I don’t want to say you can eat literally whatever you want as long as you exercise and be healthy because that isn’t the case. ‘Obesity is a huge concern around the world, but inactivity is the big killer of our time. Many people simply think that running is something that fat women can’t or shouldn’t do at all, including some medical professionals - I am on a mission to prove otherwise.’ Julie set up The Fat Girls’ Guide to Running website which gives tips on how to start running if you are larger or a mother, as well as nutrition tips, events as well as running campaigns such as ‘Kit that Fits’ which encourages companies to make workout clothes available in larger sizes. Julie says: ‘ The blog was going on in the background telling my story and I started to get people coming to me asking for advice. ‘It was getting upwards of 10,000 hits and I started to think, this is something I am really passionate about and I could do it full time.’ The website, which advocates the Health at Every Size approach or HAES, states: ‘Being overweight in this modern world is not an easy thing what with the Medias obsession with an unachievable idea of “The Perfect Body” the pressure to be a certain size and to live a healthy lifestyle has never been stronger. Julie now runs day-long retreats for women where, as well as running, they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active . ‘But we all know that slim does not equal fit, and fat does not always equate to being unhealthy, or inactive, or lazy, or… all of those other negative connotations that it has acquired over the years. ‘HAES isn’t suggesting that everyone of every size is always healthy – a popular misconception. Instead, it focuses on helping anyone interested in being as healthy as they can be in the body they have right now. Hand in hand with this it challenges size stigma to advance equality.’ Julie hopes to continue to expand the website, and now runs day long retreats for women where, as well as running, they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active.","Julie began training after a comment from a spectator at a 3k fun run .

"The parents of an eight-year-old boy . let him die in agony from a treatable cancer because they were too busy . lying in bed taking drugs, it emerged today. Monica Hussing, 37, and William . Robinson Sr., 40, were jailed for eight years in Ohio yesterday after . pleading guilty to denying their son Willie medical treatment for . Hodgkin's lymphoma. The appalling tale of neglect unfolded as the court heard that Willie had . suffered for more than two years with pain and swollen neck glands which grew eventually to the size of a softball. But despite the boy pleading for help, his parents failed to do anything. Cuyahoga County Judge Michael Astrab compared the autopsy photo . of Willie's emaciated body to that of a concentration camp victim. Neglect: Monica Hussing, 37, and William Robinson, 40,  have been jailed . for eight years after admitting that they did not take their . son, who was suffering from a curable cancer,  to the doctor despite his pleas . Pleaded for help: Prosecutors say Willie Robinson begged his mother and father to take him to the doctor . 'If anybody, . anybody, didn't know this kid was sick, they are seriously, seriously . disturbed,' he said. Monica Hussing's sister Sheila . Slawinski wept as she told the court that her nephew had pleaded with . her shortly before he died: 'I am . so in pain ... please take me to the doctor ... the last four weeks have . been the most painful.' Miss Slawinski said: 'I told my sister. I offered to help my sister.' Hussing and Robinson had claimed that the family, who lived in Warren, could not afford medical bills. Hussing said they . tried repeatedly to get help from social services and visited a free . clinic but left when told they would have to pay $180. However, the prosecution said that despite claiming financial hardship the couple had paid $87 to have a pit bull treated for fleas. The prosecution said at . least eight family members noticed Willie's deteriorating health over a . period of more than two years and most spoke to the couple about it. One relative described the boy's swollen neck glands as the size of a softball. Miss Slawinski said: 'Twenty-nine months he suffered. Twenty-nine months they had to do something and they chose not to.' Asked outside court why her sister . hadn't taken care of Willie and hadn't enrolled him or his three siblings in . school, Miss Slawinski said it was easier for Hussing to stay in bed during . the day and do drugs. Both parents abused drugs, their attorneys . earlier told the judge. Shortly after their visit to the clinic the family moved to Cleveland, where Willie died within weeks - on March 22, 2008. Two doctors told the judge before the sentencing that no sick child would be turned away from a hospital. Needless tragedy: Willie, eight, died of Hodgkin's lymphoma which has a 96 per cent survivability rate if properly treated . Hussing and Robinson were given the maximum . prison sentence after changing their plea to guilty of attempted . involuntary manslaughter just as their trial was about to begin. They were handcuffed and taken into custody immediately. Both plan to appeal the sentence. 'I loved my son,' Robinson told the judge, occasionally wiping his eyes with a tissue. He said he was sorry. 'I tried to help my son,' Hussing said as family members in the courtroom quietly sobbed. Hussing's oldest daughter, Lillian, . 18, defended her mother in court and claimed Willie was able to do the . same things as other eight-year-olds. 'He was able to play, go outside, she said. The judge looked surprised and asked . the teenager if she would be willing to repeat her statements under oath . and possible penalty of perjury. She did. Trumbull County Children Services . said it had worked with the family to provide Willie with health care, . getting involved after receiving a phone call in July 2007. Agency officials said a case worker . visited the family at least monthly and pushed the parents to have a . medical follow-up on the child's swollen neck but they failed to do so. However, Robinson's attorney Thomas . Rein said previously that a social worker who visited the family in . January 2008 'indicated the kids were healthy and happy'. He said no one knew Willie had cancer until he died and an autopsy was performed. And Lillian Hussing said a case worker . had told the family her brother's lump looked like a swollen gland and . to hold off until they could secure financial assistance before getting . it checked. Monica Hussing, pictured with her lawyer John Luskin, is handcuffed after sentencing. She claimed she had tried to help her son . William Robinson told the court he was sorry and that he had loved his son Willlie . About two weeks after they moved to . Cleveland, she said, her brother came down with something. Her mother . treated him with cold medicine and he died within three days. She said the boy never complained about his neck. 'He played, he went outside, he wrestled, he played video games,' she said. 'He was the happiest kid you could imagine. It never seemed like he was suffering.' The emotional aftermath from their son's death led the couple to split, according to Hussing's defense attorney, John Luskin. He also said that the dog which had been treated for fleas had belonged to Hussing's parents and they had paid for the treatment. The couple's four other children under 18 were placed in the custody of a family member. Mr Luskin said Lillian, upon turning 18, decided to return to live with her mother. Lillian said her mother took a . plea bargain because of the uncertainty of a trial and fear she could . be sent to prison for a long time. Mr Rein said Robinson agreed to plead . guilty so his children could be spared any further grief and wouldn't . have to suffer by testifying. As part of the deal, the prosecution . agreed to drop four counts each against each parent, including child . endangering. Prosecutors didn't agree to a sentence recommendation. Both . Mr Luskin and Mr Rein had said they hoped the judge would consider . probation. 'There's not a day my client ... starts without shedding a tear for his son,' Mr Rein said. The coroner ruled that the boy was a victim of medical neglect and died from pneumonia due to Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a highly . treatable cancer, with as many as 95 per cent of patients in early . stages of the disease surviving for five years or more with treatment. It's one of the most common forms of cancers among children. Dr Stanton L Gerson, director of the . Case Comprehensive Cancer Center at Case Western Reserve University, . said parents should watch for glands that are swollen for more than two . or three weeks, particularly if accompanied by weight loss and nighttime . fevers .","Willie Robinson died from Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2008 after suffering for more than two years .

"'Sirloin' and 'tofu' have become code words for 'Republican' and 'Democrat' in Colorado, and a former right-wing state legislator assigned liberals the role of pressed bean curd during a conservative convention in Denver. John Andrews, president of the Colorado state Senate until 2005 and now Director of the Centennial Institute – an affiliate of Colorado Christian College – told a crowd estimated at 3,000 that speakers at the three-day session would not be permitted to talk about candidates, parties or elections. 'Republican' and 'Democrat' were four-letter words at the Western Conservative Summit, he said. Instead, attendees should talk about meat and fake meat. John Andrews, a senior official at Colorado Christian College and the director of its affiliated Centennial Institute, told thousands that no one at the Western Conservative Conference could talk about elections, candidates or political parties . For three days in Denver – and maybe longer – grilled steak and sliced bean curd have replaced elephants and donkeys as the preferred political mascots . 'I need to let you in on a secret,' Andrew said after speeches by gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez and Rep. Cory Gardner, who is running neck-and-neck with Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in his upset bid. 'You have probably noticed that as we brought out Bob Beauprez and Cory Gardner, that something was missing,' he said. 'Something was not said about them or by them about how they're spending 2014.' 'I can give you the reason why in two words: Lois Lerner.' Lerner is the former IRS official at the center of an alleged plot to target conservative nonprofits for their beliefs by subjecting them to intrusive scrutiny and years-long delays when they applied for tax-exempt status. Her office, the Exempt Organizations Division, began a push in 2010 to evaluate applications with an eye toward the possibility of partisan political activity that might disqualify groups from that special status under section 501(c) of the tax code. 'Yes, Colorado Christian University enjoys a 501(c)(3) tax status,' Anderson explained, 'and we've been advised that the summit needs to stick to issues and ideas, and principles and policies. And that at this summit, because we don't have all the candidates represented, we can't talk about anybody being a candidate.' 'So we can't talk about candidates,' he said to a mini-chorus of gasps. 'We can't talk about races. We can't talk about parties, or Republicans and Democrats.' Enter the attorneys. 'I had the code researched by the best tax lawyer in the country,' said Anderson. 'I said, ""Are we allowed to talk about sirloin and tofu?"" He said, ""Yes you are"".' Sirloin power: The Western Conservative Summit had the top trending hashtag among tweets in Denver on Friday, and the eight-most-tweeted in the United States . 'So let's just make this agreement ... If you form a mental association between ""Republican"" and ""sirloin,"" and between ""Democrat"" and ""tofu,"" and I was to say to you that every time I whiff Bob Beauprez or Cory Gardner it makes me wanna eat more sirloin and less tofu, you would know what I was talking about, right?' Anderson then introduced Jill Repella, a county commissioner running for the job of lieutenant governor. Repella, he said, was the evening's 'third helping of sirloin.' In a state known for cattlemen, the program's Friday night headliners included other cuts of meat, and no tofu. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and crowd favorite Dr. Ben Carson – who has attracted a multimillion-dollar 'draft' committee urging him to run for president – were on the butcher's cart. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin will speak Saturday .","Colorado Christian think-tank leader told political convention-goers he can't talk about candidates, parties or elections .

"The Prince of Wales became a royal postman yesterday after he agreed to deliver a well-wisher's card to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with a £10 note enclosed for his 'marvellous' first grandson. Jubilant royalist Amanda Winney, 49, popped the cash into the card in the hope Kate and William would buy a cuddly toy for their new son, and incredibly Prince Charles took it off her hands. The incident at the  Royal Welsh Show  in mid Wales, came in a whirlwind 24 hours for the prince, who was in such a hurry to see his son’s first born he raced across the country by helicopter. Happy day: Prince Charles gets warm congratulations as he meets people at the Royal Welsh Show today, including one woman who asked him to deliver a card and some cash for his first grandchild . Having a giggle: Prince Charles laughs as he views livestock in the show ring  at the Royal Wales Showground . Busy few days: The rollercoaster ride to the royal baby's birth led to Charles and Camilla, pictured today, flying to the Lindo Wing by helicopter . Gifts: A member of the public presents Prince Charles with a wonderful Welsh sheep skin rug on a walkabout where he shook hands with many who congratulated him on become a grandfather . Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son out of hospital, but they are yet to decide on a name . In Yorkshire for long-planned public . engagements, the heir to the throne flew the 240 miles from Leeds to . London before being rushed to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington in a . police convoy. Asked how his first grandchild was as he rushed out of the Lindo Wing . Prince Charles replied: ‘Marvellous, thank you very much, absolutely . wonderful,’ and revealed that the baby would be leaving by saying 'you'll see in a minute'. Today Mrs Winney weaved her way through the throng at the hugely popular Royal Welsh Show to take pole position in the crowd as the Prince passed by. She then attracted the Prince' attention with a beaming smile as she waved the card in his direction and shouted 'congratulations'. The Prince was on his way to the annual agricultural event's main show ring after being shown some prize winning cattle. But he leaned in and spoke to Mrs Winney, who had travelled up from Leominster for the day, talking with her briefly and leaving with the card. 'He took the card, it's absolutely fantastic,' an ecstatic Mrs Winney said. 'It's amazing to meet him. He shouldn't really be here what with the new baby, but duty calls in his case. 'But he took the card and said that he will pass it on, which is fantastic.' Poking fun: Camilla smiles broadly as Prince . Charles asks journalists outside St Mary's Hospital: 'Have you been . there long?' before heading up the steps to meet his first grandchild . Big visit: The proud grandparents stopped and waved to the crowd as they prepared to enter the hospital . She . said the card, inside a pale blue envelope, depicted a baby in a cradle . on the front. A crisp new £10 note was slipped inside. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are spending the day visiting the biggest agricultural show in Europe. A heavily pregnant mother-to-be who . has resisted learning the gender of her baby also attracted the . attention of the Prince of Wales today. Bethan Davies, 36, got a big surprise when a beaming Charles gave his royal approval to her approach to childbirth. 'He asked me whether I was late and I said no, that I am due on Monday,' said Mrs Davies, from Llangadog in Powys. 'He asked if I knew whether it was a girl or a boy and I said, ""No it's going to be a surprise."" 'He said that it is nice to be surprised and that they had not known either. They were surprised too.' The pair both looked in high spirits are they arrived this afternoon to visit the new baby a few hours after the Middletons . Animated: Prince Charles held his hands out as he addressed the media as he climbed out the car outside the London hospital . The mammoth four-day Royal Welsh Show, which was set up over a century ago, attracts at least 200,000 visitors annually. Based at its own purpose-built ground at Llanelwedd, Builth Wells, the event is a showcase for rural businesses and leisure activity. The royal couple will take a full tour of the event during their visit, taking in the show's main ring and its large food hall. This year the Royal Welsh is marking its half century since first moving to its permanent site in mid Wales. During their tour the royal couple will meet with farmers, members of rural charities, volunteers and local business owners. Charles, who yesterday described his first grandchild as 'marvellous' after he and Camilla visited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their new baby in hospital, will also meet an array of people who have benefited from The Prince's Countryside Fund of which he is president. The fund, set up by his Business in the Community charity, backs projects which support people who care for the countryside. At the event this year are almost 7,400 entries competing in livestock competitions and there are over 1,030 trade stands. Thrilled: Kate's parents Carole and Michael smiled broadly as they arrived at hospital to see their daughter and meet their new grandchild . Few words: Carole said the baby was 'absolutely beautiful' and that William and Kate were coping 'fabulously' Prince Charles had been beaten to the hospital by more than two . hours by the other set of grandparents, Michael and Carole Middleton. But the Palace was keen to stress there was no breach of protocol in . these modern times. While the Middletons had remained, on . tenterhooks, at their £4.8million Georgian mansion in Bucklebury, . Berkshire, all day on Monday, it was a self-imposed wait to give the new . parents some time and space together rather than as a result of any . directive imposed by the Palace. When they finally arrived in a rather battered black taxi at 3pm yesterday, their smiles lit up the street.","Prince Charles agrees to take Amanda Winney's card and cash to deliver to Kensington Palace himself .

In an interview with The Mirror Bobbi admitted, 'We had to take away all the knives, scissors, anything that was sharp.' 'He told his sister he wanted her to get a knife, and said when I was asleep that night he was going to stab me. 'She was distraught and came to tell me but I told her he couldn’t because there was nothing in the house to do it with.' J-J has had various differing diagnoses -- ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder), ODD (Oppositional Defiance Disorder) and OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). Not-so angelic: Bobbi's son J-J regularly attacks his mother and has even plotted to kill her . But whatever syndrome he may suffer from, J-J knows he's not like most other children. 'My mum would probably describe me as quite a strange child,' he says. 'Sometimes I shout at people and call . them mean names. And also I can really hurt people. Sometimes when I'm . really angry mum calls me the Incredible Hulk.' For step-father Lee, coping with J-J's outbursts is a constant battle. 'It's . horrendous. I don't think there are many kids like this. I've had so . many experiences with him. The worst one I think can of is when he . sprayed air freshener in my eyes,' he says. Video footage from Bobbi's phone aired during the documentary gives a distressing glimpse of one of J-J's rages. He launches at his mother with full force first punching and kicking her then grabbing her hair whilst screeching, 'I hate you'. Bobbi . struggles to set herself free, then restrains him in his duvet before . putting him out of the house into the garden. But then J-J starts thrashing . at the glass with a garden spade and smashing his scooter against the . patio. J-J says his mum would probably describe him as 'quite a strange child' Super strength: Bobbi refers to her son as The Incredible Hulk . 'You can't get him back down from where he's gone. It's as if something switches off in his brain and you can't say, ""Lets talk about this"",' she says. J-J's violence also flared up at school, which has led to him being expelled. 'The worst thing I've ever done is put a . teacher in hospital because I broke her wrist and put another teacher in . hospital because I almost detached her retina,' he explains. 'The school didn't handle him very well. The teachers didn't understand him very well, which made his behaviour even more challenging,' says Bobbi. Bobbi started noticing J-J's violent behavior from when he was a baby, but the aggression got gradually worse. 'The worst thing I've ever done is put a . teacher in hospital because I broke her wrist and put another teacher in . hospital because I almost detached her retina' J-J . Along with the violence, getting J-J to do the simplest tasks like put his coat or shoes is an immense challenge. On a good day it will take Bobbi two hours. After six months of being home schooled, Bobbi managed to get J-J a place at a new school. And with the help parenting practitioners Islay Downey and Angela Bates at Southampton Council she's also made progress with J-J's behaviour. Bobbi has given J-J more independence and freedom, while implementing firm house rules. J-J is still prone to outbursts but is slowly learning to control his aggression. 'J-J was a miracle baby - we never . expected to have a boy. I was told I had a genetic disorder which would . mean a boy wouldn't survive,' says Bobbi. 'I . know it sounds odd but I'm lucky that I'm the one calming him down. At . the moment, I'm the only one who can calm him down and that makes me . feel special.' Luckily for Bobbi, she has a willing partner to combat the abusive cycle. 'I just like to be me,' says J-J. 'But I'd rather be me and not kick-off. I don't really like being naughty. It doesn't make me feel good.' My Violent Child is on Channel 5 , tomorrow at 9pm .","Bobbi from Southampton suffers from child-on-parent violence .

"Hackers claim to have accessed the email accounts of more than two dozen law enforcement agencies in Texas and dumped the contents online. Anonymous, the loose-knit international hacking collective, said the data it posted came from the work and personal emails of officers, including department chiefs. The group said the information posted online included classified police documents as well as lewd and racist jokes. Down for maintenance: Anonymous hacked the website of the Texas Police Chiefs Association. Technicians are still trying to get it back online . In one email to a senior Texas police official accessed by MailOnline, it was written: 'That stupid b**** who started that stolen car chase at Yale and 610 got what she deserved  (I'll bet she was fat and black too). 'Same with that pervert that got shot by the county. F*** that guy, see ya. That all sounds like good police work to me. 'Those folks got the criminal cure. It's guaranteed, they will never commit a crime again.' Other emails contained offensive theories about Muslim inbreeding and the details of complaints of a police officer's affair with a married woman. Racist: This email found in the account of a Texas police chief contains racist and embarrassing comments . Hackers also appeared to take over the website of the Texas Police chiefs, replacing it with one that listed police departments and officials whose email accounts it claimed to have hacked. Anonymous posted a statement on the police website saying it was 'attacking Texas law enforcement' because of the arrests of Anonymous supporters and what the group sees as harassment of immigrants by authorities in the state. The statement read: 'Having a slow day behind the desk, filing papers, staring at your colleague's fine posterior? 'What have you been up to since our last visit? Don't answer that. We already know.' The group claimed to have been lurking inside law enforcement computer systems for a month, gathering information for a release inspired by the 'fighting spirit of WikiLeaks'. It added: 'While many of our comrades facing charges and in prison are innocent, there is no such thing as an innocent police officer, and we will continue to directly attack the prison industrial complex by leaking their private data, destroying their systems, and defacing their websites.' Warnings: This email appears to be a warning to let officers know that people they are linked to on Facebook will soon be arrested . Scandal: This email contains details of a complaint against an officer who has been discovered having an affair with a married woman . James McLaughlin, the executive director of the Texas Police Chiefs Association, said: 'They apparently hacked into our website and replaced it with one of their own.' He said he had no idea of the content of the allegedly hacked emails published yesterday, adding: 'All I know is what they [WikiLeaks] claim to have done.' He said the FBI and Texas Attorney . General had begun an investigation into the website hack and that they . hoped to track down those responsible. Anonymous said that most of the Texas law enforcement agencies it claimed to have hacked into were police departments in small cities or school district police agencies. About 10 of the email accounts were personal accounts of law enforcement officials. Robert Mock, one of the individuals whose personal email account was apparently breached, said he had only been made aware of the possibility yesterday. He said: 'I'm upset, as anybody would be whose account was hacked into. This wasn't my work account. Got my private information out there. I don't even know what's out there.' Anonymous listed Mr Mock as being a lieutenant with the Houston police department, but he said he had left the department about four years ago. Mr Mock said he still worked in law enforcement in the Houston area but declined to say where he was employed. In addition to his cellphone and water bills, Anonymous also posted emails of jokes that were forwarded to Mr Mock that made fun of Arabs and Muslims. Last month, Anonymous claimed it hacked into some 70 mostly rural law enforcement websites, mainly from sheriffs' offices in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Mississippi.",Hacking collective Anonymous 'inspired by WikiLeaks'
"House Speaker John Boehner refused on Thursday to rule out a government shutdown as a means to block President Barack Obama from halting deportations for millions of illegal immigrants. 'All options are on the table,' Boehner said during a press conference this afternoon, noting that Republicans in the House are still discussing their next move and have not made any definite decisions yet. 'Our goal here is to stop the president from violating his own oath of office and violating the Constitution. It's not to shut down the government,' he said when a reporter asked him to clarify the GOP's intentions. As Boehner walked away another reporter tried to get him to state on the record that he would not allow a government shut down, but the GOP leader did not respond. Today Fox News reported that Obama would implement a 10-point plan to change the immigration system as early as next Friday, leading to a renewed effort among House Republicans to use an upcoming spending debate to force Obama's hand. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaker of the House John Boehner refused to rule out a government shutdown today, telling reporters that 'all options are on the table' to stop President Barack Obama's forthcoming plans to halt deportations of millions of illegal immigrants . President Obama, pictured here speaking with staff before a speech today at the Association of South East Asian Nations-United States Summit in Myanmar, will reportedly announce his immigration plans as early as next Friday . Fox said Thursday that a source close to the White House confirmed that Obama is looking to expand his deferred action program that allows children of illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. indefinitely to include any one who came to the U.S. as a child. The sweeping order would also allow parents of both citizen children and illegal immigrant children to remain in the U.S.That portion of the directive alone could save as many as 4.5 million immigrants with U.S. born children from being removed from the country, Fox estimated. The section extending the president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could protect another 300,000. Instead of requiring that illegal immigrants applying for residency under the provision be under the age of 31 and provide proof that they arrived her before July of 2007, anyone who came to the country before January 1, 2010, when they were under the age of 16 would be eligible for DACA. A half-million immigrants and their spouses could apply for citizenship through a State Department visa program for high-tech jobs. Not all 10 sections of the president's plan would give cover to categories of illegal immigrants. One would give Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers a raise to 'increase morale,' Fox said. Another would authorize the Department of Homeland Security to 'promote' naturalization by giving a 50 percent discount to the first 10,000 applicants, excluding illegal immigrants whose incomes are 200 percent above the federal poverty level. The president will likely direct ICE to focus on deporting criminals over other illegals, as well. Obama was reportedly briefed on a draft of the plans on his way to Asia. The White House has yet to give its final seal of approval, however, the source told Fox News. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest today told reporters traveling with the president in Asia that Obama still hasn't made up his mind and would not make an announcement on immigration until after he returns to Washington, D.C. this weekend. Earnest said Obama is 'nearing a final decision,' however. If the timing laid out it the draft proposal is accurate, executive action would come weeks sooner than anticipated. While the president has said he would act before the end of the year, no directive was expected to come before lawmakers had passed legislation extending funding for the government. The current resolution expires Dec. 11, the day before the House is scheduled to recess until the end of the current Congress. Interference by Obama will most assuredly provoke conservative legislators in the House and Senate who are already itching to use the spending debate  to tie Obama's hands on immigration. Moises Herrera, his wife Mirna, and newborn son, David are pictured together last week. They are among the millions of illegal immigrants that could be spared from deportation as a result of Obama's pending actions . While Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has promised there will not be another government shut down, that doesn't mean that anti-amnesty zealots in his caucus, who have said they will use all procedural means available to stop Obama, won't give it another try. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who will likely ascend to chairman of the budget committee when Republicans become the majority party next year, has said he wants to use the budget process to bar spending on any immigration reforms ordered up by Obama without the consent of Congress. The Hill reported this morning that Sessions' strategy now has the backing of 50 members of the House, making it impossible for Republican leadership in both chambers to ignore. Conservatives in the House, led by Arizona Rep. Rep. Matt Salmon, sent a letter today to House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers and ranking member Nita Lowey asking them to include language in the budget 'to prohibit the use of funds by the administration for the implementation of current or future executive actions that would create additional work permits outside of the scope prescribed by Congress.' Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts also said in a statement today that he would support Sessions. 'I stand ready to do whatever it takes to stop amnesty by executive action or by any other means,' he said. Meanwhile, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn said she would reintroduce legislation at the top of the new legislative session 'to freeze DACA' and ban the president from using executive orders to create similar programs in the future. 'This election was a referendum on the Obama doctrine of lawlessness that is cracking the foundation of our democracy and shredding the Constitution,' the GOP lawmaker said in an op-ed for Breitbart News. 'The American people want it stopped, period.' Both McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner publicly warned Obama last week that he would 'poison the well' with Republicans by acting alone on immigration, but the Democratic president has not heeded their advice. In a press conference the day after the midterm elections and in an interview with CBS a few days later he said recommitted to issuing an executive order on immigration before the end of the calendar year. In a closed-door meeting with Republicans today, Boehner reportedly told his members that he told the president point blank last Friday that, ' ""If you proceed with executive amnesty, not only can you forget about getting immigration reform enacted during your presidency, you can also expect it to jeopardize other issues as well."" ' 'We don’t know when exactly he’ll do it or how exactly he’ll do it. But if he proceeds, we are going to fight it,' Boehner promised, according to a source in the room who spoke to Politico. At today's press conference Boehner was asked in no uncertain terms if the GOP would consider using the budget process to take a stand against Obama's planned actions, and Boehner repeatedly said that 'all options are on the table.' 'I'll just say this, we're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path,' Boehner told reporters. 'This is the wrong way to govern,' he added. 'This is exactly what the American people said on election day they didn't want.' Earlier today at his own presser McConnell had said that there would absolutely be no government shutdown or threatening by Senate Republicans to default on the national debt if Obama disobeys, however, potentially putting him at odds with his counterpart in the House. Obama is reportedly planning to allow illegal immigrants who came here as children and their parents to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely . Sen. Orrin Hatch, a former Judiciary Committee chairman, joined in last night on calls for Obama to hold his fire, writing in Politico Magazine that 'the president’s promise to act unilaterally in other areas will only short-circuit the statutory reforms we desperately need.' 'There is a viable path to meaningful immigration reform, but it does not begin with executive amnesty,' he said. Hatch pointed out that he is not against the comprehensive immigration reform measures backed by the president, and he in fact voted for them when they came before the Senate. Rather, he is against the 'increasingly broad carve-outs to the enforcement of our current immigration laws' that Obama is considering. Arguing that Obama is 'bowing to pressure from his base, and perhaps because of his own impatience,' Hatch said his the president's 'promise to make further unilateral changes to our nation’s immigration policy breeds mistrust and makes meaningful legislative reform even harder to achieve.' Progressives within the Democratic caucus have been pressuring Obama to broaden his 2012 immigration order for months, and upon their return to Washington after the most recent recess, they again took up the mantle. 'We're begging the president. Go big. These [illegal immigrants] are a plus to our nation. Mr. President, please. You said you were going to do something. Do it. Act now,' Rep. Juan Vargas of California said Wednesday. In an interview this morning on MSNBC Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez said the president needs to act in a 'bold' and 'generous' manner before the holiday season. 'I've always said that the blessings of Thanksgiving should be bountiful this year for millions of immigrants that have been waiting for the Congress to act,' Gutierrez told Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough. Gutierrez said it was Republicans who have proved the untrustworthy partner in immigration reform. 'Every time we set the menu, every time we set the table, they walked away,' he said. 'And they keep talking about this poison well. They kind of doubled down on poisoning the well.' Republicans 'really poisoned that well' during the midterm elections by claiming that Mexican immigrants were coming to take American jobs, Ebola could become an epidemic in the U.S. and ISIS could attack America. Still, Gutierrez said, he's ready to work with Republicans to pass immigration reform if they're willing to work with him. 'And we still have time to do it,' he said.","Obama is reportedly looking to expand his deferred action program  to include any one who came to the U.S. as a child .

"The search for Madeleine McCann has taken police to all corners of the globe. But now they are going back to where the tragic case began to excavate key sites in the Algarve holiday resort where she vanished seven years ago. The Met Police have been granted permission by Portuguese authorities to dig up land in Praia da Luz and they said the searches will begin within weeks. Aerial view: Specialist officers are also expected to examine three other sites in Praia da Luz after permission to dig was granted by Portuguese authorities, seven years after Maddie went missing from the area aged three . Madeleine, who would be ten on 12 May, was three when she vanished from her holiday flat on 3 May 2007 . There are serious concerns, however, . that their efforts could be blocked at any point by the Portuguese . authorities, amid continuing tensions between the forces. The . crucial development in the multi-million pound inquiry comes as sources . said it has been a ‘hugely emotional time’ for the McCanns. The seventh anniversary of Maddie’s disappearance on May 3, 2007, fell on Saturday. While . her parents, Gerry and Kate, both 45, have been briefed on the plans, . they are not travelling to the resort while work is carried out. The . cold case review into the three-year-old’s disappearance, known as . Operation Grange, has seen a team of detectives painstakingly search . through every document collected throughout the inquiry. Search site: The waste ground in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where Scotland Yard officers will join local police officers in digging as part of the investigation . Abroad: Specialist search teams will start by scouring sites across Praia da Luz - including this waste ground near the Ocean Club apartment complex . The digs are not thought to necessarily be in connection with a search for the youngster's body or remains . This land that was not fenced at the time of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is contiguous to the path where witnesses saw a man passing with a child in pyjamas in her arms the night of the disappearance . According . to local reports, one of the key search areas is a patch of wasteland . about the size of three football pitches, across the road from Ocean . Club where the McCanns were staying, as well as the tapas bar where they . were dining when Maddie disappeared. The . area, which is beside a school and has become overgrown with bushes and . strewn with rocks, used to be an open expanse but is now fenced off. In . the picture above, it is marked search area one. The . McCanns prayed for Maddie’s safe return in the nearby Church of Nossa . Senhora da Luz (Our Lady of the Light). At the time the roads . surrounding the 16th century church were being renovated, with huge . potholes sealed over just days after Maddie vanished. This will also be a . key site for excavation and is marked in the picture above as search . area two. A sign at the church yesterday informed worshippers of planned ‘maintenance works’ to the church and the surrounding area. According . to Portuguese daily Jornal de Noticias, officers will excavate a third . location closer to the beach (marked in the picture above as search area . three), as well as two patches of land in the countryside surrounding . Praia da Luz. Detectives are expected to use radar equipment to examine . the sites. The tools can detect changes in magnetic fields caused when . earth is disturbed and changes to wet soil caused by burial of a body. It is thought that mechanical diggers and other earth-moving equipment . will be brought in. Resort: Police are digging near the Ocean Club holiday apartments in the resort of Praia da Luz in Portugal, from where Madeleine McCann, then three, went missing in May 2007 . Dig: Detectives were also said to be excavating part of the beach in the area (pictured shortly after Madeleine's disappearance) Madeleine's parents Gerry, 45, and Kate McCann, 46, attended an open-air prayer service on Saturday . Metropolitan Police’s Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowler has blamed the Portuguese authorities for the lack of information being made public by Operation Grange. In an open letter dated today, the senior police officer said that despite pleas for the media to be briefed on ongoing developments in the search for Madeline McCann, Portugal’s Policia Judiciara have threatened to stop work if information is passed on. Revealing the ongoing tension between British and Portuguese police, Assistant Commissioner Rowley said he had explained to his opposite number in the Policia Judiciara that it is the Met’s preferred practice to make public as much information and context as possible, providing it does not compromise the investigation. He revealed that the reply from the Portuguese police was that they do not brief the media on an ongoing investigation, accompanied by a threat that if any information were to emerge, the work undertaken by Portugal on behalf of Scotland Yard would ‘cease until that problem dissipates’. ‘It is important you understand this and appreciate the position in which I find myself. We will not be able to provide any information concerning the activity because ultimately it could mean the work stops,’ Assistant Commissioner Rowley said. ‘We respect the Portuguese position as we would expect them to respect our position if we were carrying out work on their behalf in the UK,’ he added. Aerial . photographs are set to be taken to assess the area, while officers will . look for disturbances among rocks, any signs of excess soil and changes . in vegetation. The searches will be conducted by Portuguese police, with British detectives on site alongside them. Yesterday, . Met Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there was a constant . threat that their Portuguese colleagues could halt the work. In . an open letter to the media, he added: ‘This case has for some time . been moving towards increased action in Portugal. 'Whilst the process is . more bureaucratic and slower than we would wish, I now believe that . activity will occur in forthcoming weeks. ‘The . most important task for me is to build momentum and protect our . investigation, given the many lines of inquiry that we see are necessary . in order that we can do everything possible to solve the case. 'We do . not want to undermine our prospects of providing Mr and Mrs McCann with . answers.’ On Saturday, prayers were said for Maddie at her parents’ local church in Rothley, Leicestershire, to mark the anniversary. Mr . McCann said: ‘The Met are going back out to Portugal very soon. 'They . are chipping away and there is new evidence. 'We are going to continue . hoping we get a  happy outcome.’ Madeleine’s . 11th birthday is next Monday. The attorney general’s office in Portugal . confirmed that the Met Police have made five requests for help with . their investigation since August 2012, most recently this March. Police . have to write formally to the Portuguese judiciary every time they want . to act on information they believe needs to be investigated. A spokesman said the contents of the requests are confidential. Last . night, a source said that a few Scotland Yard officers are ‘discreetly’ on the ground in Praia da Luz, with a full team flying over in a few . days. Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed .

"This was a wedding Vienna will remember for years — however much it might want to forget it. The theme was pure Disney, with four white-plumed Lipizzan horses pulling a carriage containing the loving couple, who were separated by a mere 57 years. As guests gathered last weekend in the 1,441-room Schonbrunn Palace for the lavish reception, the bride and groom released two symbolic white doves into the air. The 24-year-old bride, former Playboy Bunny Cathy Schmitz, wore an explosion of purple and white chiffon over a jewelled strapless bustier, topped off with a white fur jacket. Scroll down for video . Highest fee: Richard Lugner reportedly pay $500,000 to have Kim Kardashian attend as his date this year . Her groom, 81-year-old Austrian billionaire Richard Lugner, wore a top hat and an expression of sadness. To be fair, he always looks like that, having had plastic surgery on his eyelids in an attempt to look like George Clooney. ‘Apart from a big age difference, everything fits,’ he said of his fifth marriage. But aside from the glorious eccentricity of his latest nuptials, the union throws up a tantalising question: will the new Mrs Lugner put a stop to the oddest and tackiest date in the international showbusiness calendar? Every year, her new husband — nicknamed ‘Concrete’ due to his roots in the building trade — famously bribes a glamorous and usually busty female celebrity to be his companion at the glittering Vienna Opera Ball. If spending an evening being whirled around the dance floor by a doddery octogenarian with virtually no English, or sipping champagne with him in his private box, doesn’t sound seductive enough, the trip also includes an obligatory tour of his local shopping mall, Lugner City. How could any girl say no? Expensive date: Sophia Loren was reportedly paid $110,000 to attend the ball as his date in 1995 . Close-up: The eccentric Lugner, pictured with Farrah Fawcett in 2001, has starred in his own TV reality show . More shocking than his gall in trying to buttonhole the cream of Hollywood pulchritude is the fact that so many stars have actually said yes. And big names to boot. Since the cheesy tradition started in 1991 with the voluptuous Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida, she was followed during the Nineties by Joan Collins, Sophia Loren, Raquel Welch, Grace Jones, Faye Dunaway and even Sarah, Duchess of York. Host with the most: Billionaire Richard Lugner with Geri Halliwell at the glittering Vienna Opera Ball . The following decade saw Jacqueline Bisset, Farrah Fawcett, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell take the Austrian’s not ungenerous schillings. Snooty Viennese society has attacked Mr Lugner as a flashy, publicity-obsessed parvenu who has brought Austria’s most prestigious social event into disrepute. There have been calls for the ‘ageing horny builder’, as one outraged grandee called him, to lose his box at the ball. However, the eccentric Lugner — who has starred in his own TV reality show, formed his own political party and has gone to other balls in drag — is not at all daunted. Neither are the stars who continue to accept his invitations — and his money. Over the years, the celebrity guests themselves have had little to say about their date with Lugner — but you can understand their reticence to discuss such shamelessly mercenary behaviour. A seasoned ball observer yesterday compared it with the A-List Hollywood stars who sneak off to Tokyo to appear in tacky Japanese commercials for which they are paid fortunes — knowing they will never be seen in the U.S. Of course, some of these world-famous women may be curious to attend the world’s most famous ball, held amid the splendour of chandeliers, gilded ceilings and marble statues in Vienna’s neo-Classical Opera House. But the chief draw is invariably financial. Lugner pays a five or six-figure sum to his guest, as well as flying her and a few hangers-on to and from Vienna by private jet, and putting her up at a suite in one of the city’s most luxurious hotels. This year, the fee reportedly rose as high as $500,000 when he paid reality TV phenomenon Kim Kardashian to attend — albeit with disastrous results, more of which later. But in celebrity-starved Austria, Lugner strives to get his money’s worth by agreeing a contract which outlines his guest’s obligations to him. 'A great dancer': Mr Lugner said that he loves it when his guests are gracious enough to dance with him. Above, the billionaire with actress Faye Dunaway, who was his date to the event in 1999 . They must accompany him to a pre-ball Press conference and spend a few hours signing autographs in his shopping mall, Lugner City. Joining him on the dance floor for the Blue Danube is not obligatory, although Mr Concrete makes it plain it would be appreciated. Many stars, it seems, don’t play ball, doing the bare minimum contractually before they can flee back to London, New York or Los Angeles. The Duchess of York, Lugner’s guest in 1997 for a reported $40,000 (a bargain compared to the $110,000 he reportedly paid for Sophia Loren two years earlier), did at least speak to the media at the ball. ‘It is wonderful to see all the men in their finery with their white ties on and listen to the excellent music,’ she told Austrian TV blandly. Open: The Duchess of York, Lugner’s guest in 1997 for a reported $40,000, did at least speak to the media . Of course, she had debts to pay off at the time and a book to promote. Still, to sweeten the deal, Lugner paid for a three-room suite at Vienna’s lavish Imperial Hotel (where Adolf Hitler used to stay) and two stretch limos to ferry her around. Of course, even when you’re showering money on stars you have to be prepared for prima donna behaviour. In 1993, Joan Collins reportedly demanded an American limousine and wanted special pencils for her autograph-signing session. She stipulated that she wouldn’t be asked to sign any books that had been written by her sister, Jackie, and also asked for a wraparound table to hide her legs. ""A real-life beast"": In 1993, Joan Collins reportedly demanded an American limousine and a specific table . Lugner refused to comment on reports he had paid the actress £57,000. ‘I never talk about money,’ he said. ‘It isn’t nice for Miss Collins to read what she is getting.’ When Sharon Stone backed out of Lugner’s invitation to attend the 1996 ball, he recruited Amazonian singer Grace Jones at the last minute. She insisted on bringing along her boyfriend, and poor Mr Lugner didn’t get a look-in. ‘He makes too much love, this boyfriend, and Grace spends a lot of time with him,’ he griped later. ‘They make love also in the Opera House behind the curtains. I mean, we didn’t see. We heard.’ He brought Amazonian singer Grace Jones with him to the ball in 1996 . Lugner rarely criticises his companions, but occasionally feels moved to speak out. Geri Halliwell, who graced the ball in 2005, was a nightmare, he claimed. ‘Geri Halliwell was the most difficult. She even refused to do interviews,’ he said two years ago. 'Joan Collins is a real-life beast, not just on TV. Grace Jones had sex — before the ball, during the ball and after the ball!’ Danish actress Brigitte Nielsen — ex-wife of Sylvester Stallone — was the ‘nicest’ guest he had ever had. He also loves it when his guests are gracious enough to dance with him. Faye Dunaway and Grace Jones were ‘great dancers’, he recalled. Standout: Danish actress Brigitte Nielsen — ex-wife of Sylvester Stallone — was the ‘nicest’ guest he had ever had . Other guests have complained of being treated like pieces of meat at the ball. Dita Von Teese, the burlesque dancer who accompanied him in 2008, complained that she was ‘trampled in a mob scene by the Press’, which was ‘very frightening’. It’s fair to say Lugner isn’t the dish he may once have been. There have been unkind sneers about the declining calibre of stars he takes to the ball nowadays. He also seems to be paying a lot more than he used to. But even trainwreck actress Lindsay Lohan didn’t manage to honour her reported $150,000 deal to attend in 2010. After missing the jet he’d laid on, she refused to take a scheduled flight or even share another private flight, and didn’t go. The following year, he withdrew his invitation to actress Bo Derek after claiming she’d demanded $25,000 more than agreed. Lugner boasted he had 20 other candidates. Given he opted for Karima El Mahroug, the teenage dancer accused of being paid for sex by Silvio Berlusconi, one can only wonder what the rest were like. After this year, those who say he is ruining the ball’s reputation have even more ammunition. After paying Kim Kardashian a small fortune to attend, Mr Lugner complained that she was ‘annoying’. She was ‘refusing to stick with the programme’ by going off to film her reality TV show at a local restaurant instead of being with him. She even refused to dance with the old boy after he’d announced at a Press conference that she would. Instead, she offered her mother as a dancing partner. The Kardashian camp told a different tale, saying Kim had fled the ball after being approached by a ‘blacked-up’ white man mimicking her now-husband, rapper Kanye West. It was also claimed that Kardashian felt Lugner was overly tactile, and asked her to dismiss her minders so they could be alone. Perhaps, given such controversy, the fact that he is newly married might bring this eccentric annual tradition to an end — or perhaps there are some female celebrities left who still think an invitation from Mr Concrete is just too good to turn down.","Austrian billionaire Richard Lugner, 81, bribes celebrities to be his date .

The Blues are currently on course in all competitions, most recently defeating Derby 3-1 to advance to the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup.

"He is famous for inhabiting his screen roles so completely that they come alive in a way few actors can match. But Robert De Niro, who actually became a New York cabbie before playing one in Taxi Driver, remains an enigma himself. The star is so notoriously sphinx-like about his private life that even co-stars have admitted they haven’t a clue what he is really like. Now, an exhaustive biography has claimed that De Niro’s obsessive secretiveness may cover more than his natural shyness. Scroll down for video . At the height of his fame his life spiralled into cocaine abuse (Pictured with Uma Thurman in Mad Dog And Glory in 1993) At the height of his fame — when he had conquered showbusiness with films such as Raging Bull and The Deer Hunter — his life spiralled into cocaine abuse and a friendship with comedian John Belushi that had tragic consequences. In De Niro: A Life, film writer Shawn Levy also reveals new details about the actor’s compulsive womanising and sometimes high-handed treatment of the black women he chose to seduce, including claims that he pressured one of them to have an abortion. He may not have appeared in a truly great film for more than 20 years, but De Niro is still spoken of with awe by movie buffs who recall his glory years in the Seventies and Eighties. This was an actor so perfectionist that he learnt a Sicilian dialect to play mobster Vito Corleone for The Godfather II, and put on 70lb and took up boxing for his Oscar-winning role as Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull. Although biographer Levy is star-struck by De Niro’s brooding performances, he admits the actor could be thin-skinned, quick-tempered and focused on his career above all else. Robert De Niro as Jake La Motta in Raging Bull (1980). He won Best Actor for the performance at the Oscars . The actor plays Travis Bickle in 1976 movie Taxi Driver - a film which also starred actress Cybill Shepherd . Socially, he was something of a cold fish. When his first marriage, to actress Diahnne Abbott, effectively ended in separation in 1979, he publicly blamed the pressures of celebrity. But Levy says that afterwards he pursued the bachelor life with ‘single-minded purpose’. According to Levy, De Niro became more publicity-averse, partly because ‘increasingly he was living a lifestyle that he was keen never to have revealed’. Raised in a bohemian home in New York’s Greenwich Village, the driven De Niro had had no time for Sixties hippy drug culture. But the following decade, along with many in Hollywood, he indulged heavily in cocaine. A shared love of the white powder lay behind his unlikely friendship with comic actor John Belushi, says Levy. The intense, bottled-up actor and the madcap comedian would regularly carouse the night away in Los Angeles and New York. In February 1982, both were staying at the Chateau Marmont hotel in LA. Belushi’s drug abuse was so severe he was snorting heroin. At 3am one morning, after a night of excess with Robin Williams — who killed himself three months ago — De Niro turned up at Belushi’s bungalow in the hotel grounds. De Niro prefered his relationships to have no strings, so he could see other women. Pictured above with Toukie Smith . There, Levy claims, he ‘let himself in, helped himself to a little bit of the cocaine displayed on a table, and left again’, saying barely a word to Belushi. When the hotel manager told him the next day that Belushi had died hours later from an accidental drug overdose, De Niro cried. The actor was even more ‘horrified’ because the tragedy had a terrible twist. Belushi had wanted to play a rock star in his next film and planned to imitate De Niro’s technique of immersing himself in a role, says Levy. This would involve him injecting himself with real heroin. After Belushi’s death, a mutual friend named Richard Bear allegedly reminded De Niro that he had heard the two actors discussing the idea only days earlier. Investigators later found the death to be due to a deadly cocktail of heroin and cocaine, called a speedball, administered by a female friend of Belushi. De Niro’s sex life was also messy in those heady years, Levy recounts. After he split from Diahnne, Hollywood gossip was that he was involved with the actress Bette Midler in the early Eighties, when she was unmarried. There were plenty more. One relationship that came back to haunt him was with Helena Springs, a stunning black singer. She recalls how De Niro followed her in his car through Los Angeles one day and asked her out for lunch. He may not have appeared in a truly great film for more than 20 years, but De Niro is still spoken of with awe by movie buffs who recall his glory years in the Seventies and Eighties . The new biography contains several accusations of De Niro (pictured left in 1990 movie Goodfellas) bullying women . De Niro prefered his relationships to have no strings, so he could see other women, and this is how his affair with Springs continued for several years. Springs has claimed she aborted her first pregnancy without telling him but, when it happened again in 1981, she said she decided she would have the child. De Niro was not happy. There followed ‘what she described as a series of ugly and intimidating conversations and encounters aimed at getting her to terminate the pregnancy’, says Levy. After she gave birth to a daughter, Nina, De Niro gave her $50,000 but refused to provide his medical history or a blood sample, fearing she would use these to extract more money. Ten years later Springs sued him for child support and De Niro did submit to a blood test, which showed he wasn’t the father. The new biography contains other accusations of De Niro bullying women. Actress Cybill Shepherd starred with him in the 1976 drama Taxi Driver and said there was ‘enormous chemistry’ between them. But when he asked her out, she turned him down. According to film director Peter Bogdanovich, Shepherd’s boyfriend at the time, De Niro then made her life hell on set. If De Niro was famously inarticulate in interviews, he had no trouble chatting up women. His ‘type’ was black, bosomy, slender-waisted and very pretty. He would often chase women in his car, accost them at public events and even see them on TV or in print, then contact them through third parties. His girlfriends in the Eighties included a Page Three girl from South London named Gillian de Terville. In the Nineties he started seeing supermodel Naomi Campbell (then barely 20 years old) after she split up with boxer Mike Tyson. They broke up several times but kept reuniting. In the 1990s he also had ‘dalliances’ with singer Whitney Houston and model Veronica Webb, and occasional dates with his co-star Uma Thurman, writes Levy. A woman who outlasted many in the actor’s attentions was a vivacious New York model named Toukie Smith. She and De Niro had twin sons together — born by surrogate — in 1995, but never married. The actor’s affections instead switched to Grace Hightower, a model and former flight attendant, and they wed in 1997. De Niro learnt a Sicilian dialect to play mobster Vito Corleone (pictured) for The Godfather II . De Niro poses with his current wife Grace Hightower who he married in 1997 . De Niro’s name continued to attract salacious headlines, though. In 1998, he was questioned by police in Paris over possible involvement in a high-class prostitution ring. One of the girls, an English porn star, told police she’d had a relationship with De Niro. He didn’t deny it, but insisted he had never paid for her company — which prosecutors accepted. Though De Niro is still married to Grace Hightower, it has been a tempestuous partnership. Some have blamed De Niro’s failure to establish stable relationships with the opposite sex on him seeing his mother do the same. She left De Niro’s father — a renowned expressionist painter, who was bisexual — after just two years’ marriage, and her son watched with dismay as she went through a string of short-lived boyfriends. He was an only child, and Levy believes it was the loneliness of those years — raised among adults with, often, no playmates — that helps to explain the secretive and guarded man he became. It may also explain why he became such a driven and brilliant actor.","In De Niro: A Life, film writer Shawn Levy offers rare insight into the actor .

"Jane Fonda’s father was cold and a bully, not to mention a shameless womaniser, but — too young to understand mental illness — his daughter always blamed the alarming behaviour of her manic depressive mother for the break-up of her parents’ marriage. The future Hollywood sex symbol, Left-wing firebrand and fitness queen felt abandoned by a mother who seemed to have time only for her little brother, Peter. When her mother — the beautiful but fragile New York socialite Frances Ford Seymour, Fonda’s second wife — was allowed home briefly from a psychiatric institution (shadowed by nurses because she was on suicide watch), she called out desperately for Jane. But the 12-year-old hid upstairs. Scroll down for video . The Hollywood sex symbol and fitness queen felt abandoned by her mother who suffered from mental illness . Frances didn’t see her daughter that day, but she did manage to distract her nurses long enough to slip a tiny razor into her pocket. A week later, on her 42nd birthday in April 1950, she shut herself in a bathroom at the hospital and used the razor to kill herself by slashing her throat from ear to ear. Unperturbed, Henry Fonda performed on Broadway that night as usual. He didn’t even give their two children the farewell letters their mother had written them, and insisted that she had died of a heart attack. Always outspoken, Jane Fonda is making headlines once more after she returned to the subject of her tragic mother at the weekend, in a speech at a fundraising event in Beverly Hills for a rape victims’ charity. Jane Fonda's father, Henry who was cold and a bully . The audience of philanthropists and activists was stunned when the 76-year-old actress revealed that her mother had killed herself after being sexually abused from the age of eight. After looking through her mother’s medical records, Jane discovered her terrible secret. She said: ‘The minute that I read that, everything fell into place.’ She didn’t say who had been responsible, but made clear it explained a lot. ‘I knew [the reason for] the promiscuity, the endless plastic surgery, the guilt, the inability to love or be intimate, and I was able to forgive her and forgive myself,’ she said. Friends say that her mother’s suicide was the single most formative event in Fonda’s multi- faceted life. In truth, however, abuse allegedly suffered by her mother during her childhood is just one of many unpleasant details in the history of the Hollywood acting dynasty. Henry Fonda was a rising star in 1936 when he met Frances on the set of a British film, Wings Of The Morning, which he was making in Denham, Buckinghamshire. After a whirlwind romance, she chivvied him into getting married. Frances was the daughter of an American industrialist whose family claimed ancestry from Henry VIII’s third wife Jane Seymour – a fact that was reflected in Jane Fonda’s full name being Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda. Jane Fonda has told friends she believes her mother was sexually abused by a piano tuner. She believe the ordeal left Frances traumatised, and turned her into a promiscuous adolescent who had nine abortions before Jane was born. Her first, much older husband, businessman George Brokaw, was a violent alcoholic who beat her savagely. As a mother of two young children, the flighty and self-absorbed Frances ignored her daughter, who she left to be brought up by nannies. Her father was no better, preferring to fly kites with the movie star Jimmy Stewart than spend time with his children. Henry with Jane's mother Frances who had nine abortions before she was born . Although he played many of cinema’s most memorable ‘heroic’ roles, in films such as 12 Angry Men and The Grapes Of Wrath, off-screen, Fonda was a useless father and unfaithful husband. Frances was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after the birth of Peter in 1940. Discovering that her husband was cheating on her with other women, Frances went to desperate lengths to regain his attention. She would walk around naked in front of him and even crawl on her hands and knees to him, begging him to talk to her. It didn’t work. Moving from Los Angeles to New York when Fonda got a role on Broadway, Frances sank further into depression — and her behaviour became ever more alarming to her young children. Terrified she was losing her looks, she would spend hours in her darkened bedroom, wearing a chin strap and eye pads to keep her skin youthful. She had plastic surgery long before it was commonplace, and once confided to Jane that if she ever put on weight, she would cut it off with a knife. She finally went over the edge in 1949 when Fonda asked for a divorce to marry his 20-year-old mistress, Susan Blanchard. Frances suffered a mental breakdown and had repeated stays in psychiatric hospitals, sometimes being confined in a straitjacket. Rather than comfort a woman who was descending into madness, her husband’s main concern was for the damage it would cause to his career if word got out his wife was in a ‘loony bin’. Weeks before being placed on suicide watch, Frances stayed with a friend in Manhattan who, one night, caught her staring wild-eyed into the mirror. Frances finally went over the edge in 1949 when her husband Henry Fonda asked for a divorce to marry his 20-year-old mistress, Susan Blanchard . ‘I wonder where the jugular vein is?’ she murmured as she caressed her throat. It was a horribly prescient remark. Jane Fonda only learned the awful truth about her mother’s suicide months later when a fellow school pupil showed her a report in a film magazine. Her brother Peter didn’t know for years. By then, having been packed off to boarding school where she had nightmares every night about her dead mother, Jane wrote to her father about her terrors. Henry returned her letters with her grammatical errors highlighted in red ink, refusing ever to discuss the suicide. Jane inherited her mother’s obsession with her looks. She became a teenage bulimic, a condition that was aggravated by her perfectionist father who would tell her she was getting fat . Jane inherited her mother’s obsession with her looks. She became a teenage bulimic, a condition that was aggravated by her perfectionist father, who would badger her continually — and unfairly — that she was getting fat. Jane has said that she was ‘made to feel I would not be loved unless I was perfect’. As she admits, her icy father instilled in her a desperate obsession with pleasing men. Described as a chameleon even by her own children, Jane radically transformed herself to suit the controlling men in her life. French film director Roger Vadim, whom she married in 1965, cemented her sex symbol image with the sci-fi film Barbarella. Jane wed French film director Roger Vadim in 1965 . Jane has described him as a ‘nicer version of my father’, which — given that Vadim was an alcoholic, gambler and compulsive philanderer — was a damning verdict on Henry. They enjoyed an image as one of the world’s most glamorous couples. However, Vadim — the ex- husband of Brigitte Bardot — had persuaded Jane to accept an open marriage. According to her, it started when he brought home a red-headed high-class call girl. Stifling her anger and jealousy, she subsequently ‘threw myself into the sex’. She duly started picking up girls for threesomes, or more. ‘I took my cues from him and threw myself into the threesome with the skill and enthusiasm of the actress I am,’ says Jane. ‘I was doing it to keep a man happy.’ But Vadim made no secret of the fact that he regarded Jane as a second-rate Bardot. His infidelity, and her growing attraction to radical politics, ended their marriage after eight years. Next, she wed Left-wing activist Tom Hayden after meeting during her fateful visit to North Vietnam in 1972. Many Americans will never forgive ‘Hanoi Jane’ for her anti-war stance. As with Vadim, Jane sacrificed herself for Hayden, who made her live in a small bungalow in California and do all the laundry by hand, because he didn’t approve of washing machines. Friends say he resented her fame, but he happily lived off the money it brought to launch his political career. After she discovered Hayden was cheating on her, she was snapped up by Ted Turner, founder of the CNN TV channel. A notorious womaniser, he forced her to give up acting and become a trophy wife. A month after their wedding, she discovered he had a mistress. But it was her new-found Christianity that finally ended their ten-year marriage when Turner left her. Jane wed Left-wing activist Tom Hayden (right) after meeting during her fateful visit to North Vietnam in 1972 . She appears finally to have found contentment with her current partner, music producer Richard Perry, with whom she has been since 2009. But still, the memory of her mother’s suicide still haunts her. As Jane confided to a friend, she was once afraid that she, too, might kill herself, but she later realised that she never would. Why? ‘Because life is too damn interesting, and I think I’m too important.’","Jane Fonda’s father was cold and a bully, as well as a shameless womaniser .

"The heirs to John D. Rockefeller's massive oil riches announced they will divest their $860million philanthropic trust from fossil fuels. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund is part of a 50-group coalition that announced plans Monday to begin selling off assets tied to fossil fuels and invest in alternative energy. The move is timed to coincide with the United Nations climate summit set to begin Tuesday and marks another step in divestment's move from the campus grassroots to institutional investors. Economics: Trustee Steven Rockefeller argues that divestment has a 'moral and economic dimension' since energy industry revenues could be affected by regulation . The New York Times reports that 180 groups have so far pledged to join the movement, ranging from charitable trusts and religious organizations to pension funds and universities. Arabella Advisors, which consults with investors looking to leverage investments in social action, estimates that the pledges could encompass $50billion in capital, with an additional $1billion coming from private investors. The movement asks members to pledge to clear their portfolios of fossil fuel companies, replacing them with investments in alternative energy. It's inspired by divestment pledges used against apartheid South Africa in the 1980s. Like the anti-apartheid divestment schemes, those divesting from fossil fuels are attempting to stir debate about the contribution fossil fuels make to climate change. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund was established in 1940 by the five sons of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who inherited the massive fortune his father made in oil as founder of the Standard Oil company. The organization has already divested from tar sands and coal, according to president Stephen Heintz, but withdrawing from the wider range of fossil fuels like oil will take longer. Patriarch: John D. Rockefeller amassed his wealth through the energy company Standard Oil, which was broken up in 1911 . Grandson: Nelson A. Rockefeller served as vice president under Gerald Ford and later as governor defined a generation of liberal Republicans . “We see this as having both a moral and economic dimension,” said trustee Steven Rockefeller, a son of Nelson A.

"A Catholic family were labelled bigots by social workers after they complained about the adoption of their children by a gay couple. The parents, of Slovak Roma origin, protested after they discovered that their two youngest boys, aged four and one, were not going to be adopted by the Roman Catholic family they had asked for. They claimed the gay adoption would humiliate the children and deprive them of their Roma heritage and Catholic faith, and said the decision amounted to ‘social engineering’. Case: A Catholic family were labelled bigots by social workers in Kent after they complained about the adoption of their children by a gay couple. Above, Kent County Council in Maidstone, which organised the adoption . Yesterday, the country’s most senior family judge upheld the adoption plan. But he criticised social workers from Kent for the way they condemned the parents because of their views. Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, said in a High Court judgment: ‘It was, in my view, unfortunate that the local authority should have referred at one stage in the proceedings to the parents’ views on homosexuality in such a way as to suggest that they are bigoted. The label is unnecessary and hurtful.’ Judge: Yesterday, the country's most senior family judge, Sir James Munby, upheld the adoption plan, but criticised the social workers for the way they condemned the parents because of their views . His criticism is understood to follow a report submitted to the court by social workers which said: ‘The attitude of the parents could be perceived as bigoted.’ The row comes at a time when social workers are under pressure from the Government to abandon rules which have meant that adopted children can be placed only with new families of the same ethnic or cultural background. The doctrine has been blamed for preventing ethnic minority children from being adopted by a stable family, because there are two few people from ethnic minorities are willing to adopt. Four children of the Roma family were taken into care last year while the family were living in a four-bedroom house in Kent arranged for them by a charity. Social workers found the children were not going to school or getting medical care, and were ‘over-chastised’, dirty and unkempt. They said the parents failed to keep one of the younger boys in a ‘smoke-free area’. Protesting against the adoption of their two youngest boys, the parents said in a statement to the High Court that the adopters ‘are a homosexual couple and as such their lifestyle goes against our Roma culture and lifestyle'. They added: 'The children will not be able to be brought up in the Catholic faith because of the conflicts between Catholicism and homosexuality.' The parents said that if when the children were older they discovered ‘the huge differences’ between the Roma culture and the couple who brought up, ‘this is likely to cause them great upset’. The parents said the adoption ‘would cause the children great psychological harm as homosexuality is not recognised in the worldwide Roma community. Having Roma children live with homosexuals or being adopted by them would be found to be humiliating’. Court: The parents, who are of Slovak Roma origin, said in a statement to the High Court (pictured) that the adopters 'are a homosexual couple and as such their lifestyle goes against our Roma culture and lifestyle' They added: ‘This is social engineering . and is a conscious and deliberate effort by Kent County Council to . transform our children from Slovak Roma children to English middle class . children.' But Sir James rejected their pleas, saying: ‘The children’s welfare needs outweigh the impact that adoption would have on their Roma identity.’ He said the future of the two boys should be finally settled by judges at the Family Court in Canterbury. A Kent County Council spokesman said: ‘We are pleased that the court has recognised that... our paramount consideration has been the children’s long-term welfare.’","Family, of Slovak Roma origin, protested against adoption of their boys .

"A sitting U.S. congressman suggested on Wednesday that the Secret Service would be better able to protect the president and his family if the White House went old school with its security measures – and installed a moat around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Tennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen made the idea part of his brainstorm in a Q-and-A session with Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy during a Capitol Hill hearing. 'Would a moat – water, six feet around, be kind of attractive and effective?' a straight-faced Cohen asked. Clancy replied that changes to the presidential mansion's perimeter fence was the main upgrade under consideration. 'Like a higher fence?' Cohen followed up. 'You're right sir, a higher fence would certainly help us,' the Secret Service director told him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A JOKE, SORT OF: One television network mocked up what 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue might look like surrounded by a ditch filled with water to deter would-be intruders . NO DRAWBRIDGE (YET): Tennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen asked during a congressional hearing if the White House needed a six-foot moat to deter deranged people from sprinting across the president's lawn and bursting into his home . Secret Service Acting Director Joseph Clancy is playing mop-up after former chief Julia Pierson's resignation, apologizing to Congress for hooker scandals, security breaches and a shooting, and explaining what policies have changed in their wake . Clancy appeared before a House Judiciary subcommittee, promising that he would root out the bad actors behind a series of scandals plaguing the storied agency that has protected every president since Grover Cleveland. Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert, on the other hand, used talk of a fence upgrade as an opportunity to slap the Obama administration's approach to securing America's southern border. Federal officials have argued that fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border would be worthless. 'I would think that if the admin's gonna being consistent,' Gohmert said, 'it's now time to remove the fence from around the White House – 'cause if it isn't good enough for our border, it shouldn't good enough for our White House.' Or else, the conservative firebrand added, Obama's policymakers should admit that 'maybe there really is some real virtue in having a fence that slows people down.' In his testimony, Clancy claimed the Secret Service conducts 'some of the best law enforcement work in the world,' but conceded that it has 'fallen short' with a series of public embarrassments that led to the resignation of former director Julia Pierson. He also told lawmakers his agency was working with the National Park Service to come up with plans for new protective barriers around the White House complex that would be aesthetically pleasing but more effective than the permanent fencing currently in place. An ashen-faced Clancy recounted a 2011 shooting, a series of fence-jumping security breaches and Secret Service agents' use of prostitutes while on overseas postings – potential security disasters for the president. He described them as 'missteps,' saying that he is 'conducting a comprehensive, bottom-to-top assessment to determine the root cause.' Clancy was named the interim chief in October after Omar Gonzalez, a knife-carrying military veteran, scaled the White House's fence. Gonzalez sprinted into the mansion itself, reaching the storied East Room before an off-duty Secret Service agent subdued him. An agent who should have been the first line of defense was busy with a personal cell phone call at the time. The negative public attention generated by that case, Clancy said Wednesday, had 'detrimental effects on workforce morale and operational security, both with potentially dire consequences.' Cohen, the moat-proposing Tennessean, found it amusing. 'This guy got further in the White House than some of my Republican colleagues have ever gotten,' he said, laughing. VIGILANT, MOSTLY: Secret Service details protect the White House, the president and the first family . Other security lapses – Clancy called them 'unacceptable' and 'simply inexcusable' – have added to the sense of crisis that has enveloped the service for most of 2014. One involved a November 2011 shooting on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. that wasn't considered an attack on the president until bullet damage and broken glass was discovered days later on the White House's upper floor. 'The delay in identifying evidence of bullet impacts on the structure of the White House is unacceptable,' a contrite Clancy said. 'As a result, the agency contemporaneously instituted a systematic process to search the exterior of the White House Complex following any reported shootings in the immediate vicinity of the property.' He also fell on his sword with respect to a security breach surrounding  Obama during a September 16 visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. As the president was whisked into an elevator to attend a briefing on the Ebola virus epidemic, an armed private security guard was allowed to join him even though the Secret Service 'advance team' had not screened him and wasn't aware he was carrying a gun. That incident 'was self-reported,' Clancy said, 'and prompted an immediate after action review within hours of the president’s departure from the area.' 'While the actions of individuals are still being evaluated,' he added, 'the Office of Protective Operations provided guidance and additional written procedures to clarify and reinforce existing policies regarding armed contractors in proximity to the President to prevent similar incidents.' Texas GOP Rep. Ted Poe told Clancy during the hearing that Secret Service cannot make, and should never have made, the mistakes that got him hauled before Congress. 'There can't be mistakes, and if there are mistakes but for some other intervening reason, bad things are gonna happen,' Poe said. 'The can be no mistakes ever. You cannot do a redo if there is a mistake of security of the president and the president's family.' LOW-TECH FENCE: Omar Gonzalez scaled the wrought-iron barrier in front of the White House on September 19 and ran all the way into the White House while carrying a knife in his pants pocket . Wednesday's command performance  marked Clancy's first scheduled tap-dance before impatient lawmakers since Obama plucked him out of retirement to succeed Pierson, whose stock seemed to plummet monthly after a much-ballyhooed start as the Secret Service's first female director. Before his retirement, Clancy had led Obama's personal protection detail, the visible-yet-invisible cadre of armed and earpiece-wearing agents trained to take a bullet for the president. Now he's in the position of arguing that the service is stretched too thin to perform its core functions with sufficient integrity. After the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, the agency was tapped to provide security screening for large public events that could been seen as juicy follow-on targets for al-Qaeda, including the 2002 Winter Olympics and the two major political parties' quadrennial nominating conventions. And in addition to the 27 people who receive full-time, 'round-the-clock protection – the Obama and Biden families, former presidents, and key current government officials – the agency provided specific protection to dignitaries on 5,700 occasions during the 12 months that ended on September 30. Those included at least 390 stops during American officials' overseas trips. House Judiciary Committee member Rep. Jason Chaffetz, right, greeted Clancy before Wednesday's hearing . Clancy said Wednesday that the Secret Service has 'fallen short' with a series of public embarrassments . Clancy said the Secret Service needs, at minimum, the 6,572 paid 'full-time equivalent' positions the White House has requested in its 2015 budget. In addition to the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign season, he noted, the agency will be expected to protect Pope Francis when he visits the U.S. next year. In stark contrast to the confrontational grilling Pierson received before a congressional committee the day before her resignation, lawmakers largely took it easy on Clancy Wednesday, noting that the breaches he was there to discuss all took place before his time at the helm. Even conservative attack dogs like House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa and Benghazi Select Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy respectfully held their tongues. 'Let the record reflect I was fair at least on [this] one occasion,' Gowdy said when his time for questioning expired. Gowdy used his allotted questing period to express his concerns that the Secret Service not only has training issues that are negatively affecting agents' ability to do their jobs correctly but also 'moral' and 'character' issues that stem from their hiring practices. The South Carolinian said he was bothered by reports of agents drinking on the job and sexually harassing female officers  – systemic problems that he said wouldn't be cured with any amount of retraining. If you need to go to training to learn to not send explicit texts,' Gowdy insisted, 'you have no business being in the Secret Service.'","Tennessee Democratic Rep.

"Finding space for all the Christmas guests is never easy – even in a mansion like the Queen’s estate at Sandringham. But then, not many families have the option of stashing their relatives in the servants’ quarters. Her Majesty has invited the largest gathering in decades to celebrate Prince George’s first Christmas, meaning her frantic staff will have to put some visitors in servants’ rooms. The Queen and Prince Philip arrived at Kings Lynn in Norfolk by train. The couple will host 30 royals at their nearby Sandringham estate for Christmas . Although even with some 30 of her nearest and dearest arriving today, the Queen still could find no room for Prince Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. The Duke of York and his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie are reportedly on the guest list, but their mother was left off. Many who did get an invitation will have to share bedrooms, move to cottages on the estate or sleep in servants’ quarters. It is quite a change from last year, when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent Christmas Day with Kate’s parents in Berkshire and Prince Harry was on duty in Afghanistan. The year before, Prince Philip was in hospital for an operation. Those likely to have servants’ rooms include the Queen’s nephew Viscount Linley, his wife Serena and their children. His sister Lady Sarah Chatto, her husband Daniel and children are also likely to be included. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with their son Prince George, spent last Christmas with her parents in Berkshire . Though sprawling by most's measures, the Sandringham estate will still struggle to house all 30 guests . They could be housed in what is known as the Bachelor Wing because it houses single male staff members, usually chefs and kitchen porters. The influx of guests could see them relegated to the footmen’s bedrooms. Off the list: Prince Andrew's former wife Sarah Ferguson was not invited . A source said: ‘Sandringham is a large house but everyone will be crammed in like sardines.  There are just so many young royals now with children and the numbers keep going up. ‘It’s great for the Queen but a nightmare to cater for.’ Sandringham House, in Norfolk, has been the private home of four generations of British monarchs since 1862. Despite being set in 600 acres of woodland, the house is small by royal standards and quarters are said to be ‘cramped’. The Queen will insist on guests joining her today. The family follow the German tradition of opening presents on Christmas Eve before donning black tie for a candlelit banquet. At 10pm, the women adjourn, leaving Prince Philip to serve port or brandy to the men. On Christmas morning, they attend St Mary Magdalene, the church on the estate, before a turkey lunch at 1pm. They watch the Queen’s Christmas message on television before playing games. Prince Philip usually organises a Boxing Day shoot.","Some 30 members of the royal family to spend Christmas at Norfolk estate .

"Businessman has offered the bounty for 'injuring or killing' the suspect . A wealthy businessman who survived an attempt on his life by an armed assassin has turned the tables on his would-be killer - by putting a £20,000 contract on the hitman's head. Multi-millionaire Vadim Chiorniy, from Odessa, the Ukraine, managed to fight off his attacker who was armed with a steel bar. Now the businessman has placed an advert offering the bounty for 'injuring or killing' the suspect. Multi-millionaire Vadim Chiorniy  - from Odessa, the Ukraine - overpowered his assassin who was armed with a steel bar. Now he has offered a contract on his attacker's head . Chiorniy - who claims the contract is 'perfectly aligned in accordance with the law' - warned the hitman in the advert: 'Look around and think about it.  How many people do you know who would sell you out for that sort of money.' The tycoon made his fortune in the post-Communist 1990s and has survived several earlier assassination attempts. In the advert he tells his would be killer that the crook who hired him will already be plotting to kill him to wipe him out as a witness. 'Perfectly legal': Mr Chiorniy claims the contract is 'perfectly aligned in accordance with the law'. In the advert he offers a £20,000 bounty for 'injuring or killing' the suspect . 'How difficult will it be for the employer to get rid of you? Quite simple. He found you, and in the same way he will find someone else to break your head with an iron pipe. 'Surrender to the police? Nice try, you can attempt that. But your problem is that your testimony against the employer has value only when you give it to the court. 'Knowing your employer, are you sure that you will survive until it gets to court?' says the ad. Chiorniy adds: 'I am not interested in you. You interest me no more than a pipe which was in your hands. 'Therefore, . I offer you a deal. This is the best deal of your life, because it . gives you a chance to stay alive. Albeit a small one, but still a . chance. 'The deal is as follows. You call the number 0**-*****7 and very clearly and in detail tell me about the customer. CCTV images of the attempted killing have now been seen all over the Ukraine and Russia. Here the attacker can be see armed with a metal bar .

Police believe that Chiorniy may have been targeted for his business deals or because of his political links as the head of the Ukrainian Union of Anarchists . 'I need all the details: when did you communicate, which telephone did you call, how did you get the money? 'Your task is to convince me that you are telling the truth. After that you can run. I will not be looking for you.' Police believe that Chiorniy may have been targeted for his business deals or because of his political links as the head of the Ukrainian Union of Anarchists.

"Between the grey, graffiti-covered walls of her cramped and dimly lit cell, there  is little to reveal the life once led by British drug mule Melissa Reid. A small, pink, child’s make-up mirror is attached to her  bunk. A Disney princess bag  full of clothes rests on top of  her mattress. But her blonde locks have been shorn back to a bob and her youthful face is marked with anguish as she battles to come to terms with the situation she is in. Speaking for the first time from inside her Peruvian prison –  nearly ten months after she and fellow mule Michaella McCollum Connolly were caught attempting to smuggle £1.5 million of cocaine out of the country – she delivers a desperate testimony to the camera. Scroll down for videos . Melissa Reid no longer sports her blonde locks after 12 months in a Peruvian prison cell . The drugs were found by police in Peru food packages contained within both women's luggage . In exclusive footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday, Melissa, 20, says: ‘A year ago today I was having the time of my life and look where I am now, look at what I’m having to put up with, look at what I’ve put myself through. ‘To anybody out there who… just watch yourself, just be careful, just don’t get yourself in a position like this.’ With bags under her eyes and pain written across her face,  the contrast she presents with  the happy blonde teenager she once was – and who made headlines around the world when she was arrested – has never been more striking. The Peru Two, as they have become known, are serving seven-year jail terms and until recently were clinging to hopes that they would  soon be transferred back to the UK to finish their sentences at home. Both Melissa Reid, left and Michaela McCollum Connolly, right, were living in Ibiza before their ill-fated trip to Peru . But their chances of that were dealt a blow last week when they were unexpectedly moved to Ancon, a prison set in a desolate desert landscape hours outside Lima. It is where Peru sends foreign prisoners to serve their time. Standing by her bunk in a dark green hoodie, Melissa talks of her despair  as she faces the sinking realisation that it may be years before she again sets foot on home soil. ‘I don’t know how long right now  it’s going to take me to get home. I’m worried and I’m scared and I’m lonely and I’ve never been in this position and I don’t know what to do. ‘I don’t know how to improve how I’m feeling. I can’t improve my living conditions so I just need to live for the day and obviously hope that this is going to improve at some point.’ In other footage, pictured right, Melissa is seen staring blankly through bars as  she does what her life now consists of, and waits. Both woman are being held in a jail high in the Peruvian desert, pictured . The last time Melissa was filmed speaking to camera was on the day of her arrest last August, when she and Michaella were paraded by authorities in front of local media. They were detained after security staff at Lima International Airport discovered 24lb of cocaine stuffed inside food packets in their suitcases as they tried to board a flight to Madrid. Before that moment, they had been living a carefree existence on the sun-drenched Spanish party island of Ibiza. Though they had not known each other then, both had been spending the summer having the time of their lives, partying into the early hours and making the most of their youth. Melissa Reid looks despondent in her Peruvian prison cell as she contemplates her sentence . Facebook pictures which emerged after their arrest showed them enthusiastically immersing themselves in the club scene or happily posing with friends on nights out.Then, in Peru, with the make-up still fresh on their faces, the pair were filmed for the news as Melissa protested their innocence and claimed they had been forced by a gang to carry the drugs against their will. Later, however, they pleaded guilty to smuggling after being warned that they faced up to 15 years behind bars if tried and found guilty. In December, they were sentenced to six years and eight months in prison. Now the women face an uncertain wait for news as their requests to be transferred back to the UK worm their way through Peru’s complicated bureaucracy. Until ten days ago, the women were being kept at the all-female Virgen de Fatima prison in central Lima, where they had been incarcerated since  last August. Michaella McCollum Connolly, left and Melissa Reid were caught trying to smuggle £1.5 million worth of cocaine from Peru . After their surprise transfer, a  week went by before Melissa was finally able to make a two-minute telephone call to her parents. Before that, she had only been able to send them a note, writing: ‘This is like another world in here and it’s so hard to put into words what we’ve been through in the past few days, but hopefully I will speak to you soon. I can’t wait until I’m in your arms.  Love, Melissa.’ Their new home, Ancon, is a much larger, newer facility. It holds almost 3,000 prisoners, both male and female. The female wing, Ancon 2, has a special section to hold 188 foreign prisoners, the majority of whom are there for drug offences. Last night, Melissa’s father Billy,  54, said: ‘It’s been a really worrying time. The starkness of where this prison is is very daunting. ‘Having had the experience of Virgen de Fatima, and having picked up some Spanish, I’m sure that will stand them in better stead than last August when they appeared at the gates of the prison not knowing what to expect. ‘But it is new, so they’ll just need to get their head down and go with the flow and get used to the system and make the best of it. We’d love to be able to be with her at this difficult time and are just counting down the days until we see her again.’ Melissa, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, and Belfast-born Michaella, are currently being held in a ‘prevention’ area along with 30 other new arrivals, including women  from Italy, Thailand, South Africa  and Spain. During the day they can mix with the other new prisoners, but from 6pm until 6am the following morning they are locked in their cell. Their possessions, mostly clothes, books and letters from home, are held in plastic holdall bags scattered across the floor of the small cell  that they are sharing with two  other women. The mules are sharing a bunk bed, with Melissa on top and Michaella below. The toilet in their cell amounts to little more than a hole in the ground. Michaela McCollum Connolly and Melissa Reid have changed considerably since their arrests twelve months ago . Human body odour fills the air and the only natural light in the dim surroundings comes from a tiny window looking out onto a patio. The women will be held in the prevention area for up to 30 days and undergo psychological evaluation before being transferred into the main prison population. Many of the female inmates arrive at the prison with drug addictions and are put on rehabilitation programmes. The mules will eventually be moved to Pavilion 3A, the section of Ancon 2 for foreign prisoners.  The pavilion has two long corridors lined with cells each holding eight prisoners. Other footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday shows the close-packed cells, the walls littered with scraps of pictures, including one bizarre image of a Union Jack overlaid with three bikini-clad women. Both girls were sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for their part in the cocaine smuggling plot . Cells are scattered with bottles of drinking water and fruit and other personal possessions are kept on window ledges, hard against the bars. Once transferred into 3A, the friends’ facilities will extend to two phones near a large television  area, and the patio, which is bare save for a few plastic chairs. The women will be allowed to take part in workshops, including cosmetics classes, sewing lessons and psychology talks. Eventually they will be given jobs inside the prison as part of a ‘resocialisation programme’, most likely cooking, sewing and making handicrafts. As they become acclimatised to life inside Ancon 2, it will not be easy for their families to see them. Visitors to the prison – which is protected by 20ft walls topped  with barbed wire – have to endure a lengthy wait before being admitted. There are two main security checkpoints – manned by armed guards  – a pat down and two more checkpoints before visitors can finally gain access to the female wing  of the jail. On regular visiting days, it can take hours to get inside because  of the numerous searches and the long distance that has to be travelled on foot. The prison’s corridors can seem never-ending. Much like the wait the young British women now face before returning home.","Scroll down for Melissa Reid's exclusive Peruvian prison diary .

"Carlo Nash, who was banned from driving at Manchester Magistrates Court today after he was caught doing 140mph on a dual carriageway . A former Manchester City goalkeeper has been banned from driving after he was caught doing 140mph on a dual carriageway and telling police 'I am just trying to get home.' Carlo Nash, who also played for Everton, Stoke City and Norwich City, appeared in court today in connection with two speeding offences and was handed a 34 week driving disqualification, although it was suspended pending an appeal by his lawyer. The 40-year-old told Manchester Magistrates Court that he is now on jobseekers allowance after retiring from professional football and is going through an expensive divorce. The court also heard how he has sold his car and is in negative equity on his mortgage. Nash was pulled over in a Mercedes Benz courtesy car in Wymondham, Norwich, doing 140mph on February 2. Three weeks earlier he had been stopped doing 88mph on January 17. Both offences took place on the same stretch of the A11 dual carriageway. The court heard that, having been through an 'acrimonious and bitter' divorce with his wife and subsequent battle to see his two daughters, aged two and four, he had driven at speed on his return journey from Cheshire where they lived with their mother. Shilpa Chauhan, prosecuting, said: 'At approximately 22.49 the officer was travelling along the A11 northbound. There was a vehicle travelling in lane one and then another vehicle in lane two in excess of 70mph. 'Travelling in lane two was a black Mercedes saloon. The Mercedes pulled away from the officer's car. 'The Mercedes travelled along the A11 at 140pm for 1.5 miles. He was driving at double the 70mph speed limit.' 'The marked police car then pulled Nash over and having been told he had been stopped due to speeding he replied ""I was just trying to get home.""' Gwyn Lewis, representing Nash, said: 'Carlo Nash is a retired footballer. He was the former goalkeeper with a number of clubs including Manchester City, Everton and most recently Norwich City and it was when he was at Norwich City that this offence was committed. 'Whilst at Norwich City unfortunately his marriage broke up and because of this it placed him in a difficult situation. The goalkeeper was at Norwich City, when the offences took place on the A11 dual carriageway in Wymondham, Norwich . 'He absolutely dotes on his two girls and if it wasn't for that fact he wanted to maintain a relationship with these girls, this would never have happened.' The court heard that following a costly divorce with his wife he had to go to court numerous times to fight for access to the girls. Mr Lewis added: 'To see the girls he had to come up to Cheshire where they were living with his former wife. It is right to say the divorce is extremely traumatic because everything was argued about.' Nash is also set to go to trial after his wife filed a Section 4 harassment case against him. Mr Lewis continued: 'It is talking about the high end of harassment and there is going to be a trial in relation to that. He absolutely denies the fact of being involved in any harassment. 'He admits both parties have not covered themselves in glory. It is an acrimonious and bitter divorce. Many court cases have been enormously expensive. He is also receiving Job Seeker's Allowance - that's how bad it's got.' 'He has fought and fought for custody of his children. 'He was travelling from Norwich to Cheshire because it had to be him who did the transfer with the children. Nash, who formerly played for Manchester City, said he drove at speed because he was just 'trying to get home' 'After one of these visits on his way back to Norwich he was going far too fast.' Nash, who has now moved back to Manchester, drives his mother's Skoda Yeti, the court was told. Mr Lewis said: 'He is in negative equity with his property. There are no savings, nothing to rely on. In order to keep his relationship going which he is desperate to do he has to pick the girls up from where they are living near Lancaster. ""His mother has to pick them up. That would not have been a problem because until recently she could drive so she could pick her son up, then the children, transfer them back to him which happens at least twice a week. 'However on September 2 her vision was tested and it was discovered that her eyesight was below the driving standard. He can no longer rely on his mum.' The court heard how Nash had to drive a 50 mile round trip to see his daughters and that any disqualification would hamper his ability to visit them . The court also heard that Nash now had to drive a 50 mile round trip to see his daughters and that any disqualification would hamper his ability to visit them . It also heard how he is now intending to do his coaching badges in November in a course at St George's Park, the national football centre. The court was told the goalkeeper already incurred nine points on his driving licence for two previous speeding offences in March 2013 in which he received an £800 fine and six points and another in 2013 in which he received a fixed penalty. The chair of the bench, Adrian Curtis, said: 'Because of the level of the 140mph offence and taking into account the circumstances in which it took place we really have no alternative but to impose a discretionary disqualification immediately. 'This speed in fact goes way off the scale of our guidelines so we feel we have no alternative to impost the discretionary disqualification for a period of 34 weeks. For the other offence it will be a concurrent disqualification of six weeks.' 'We have to take account of your very limited means. If it were not for this the financial penalty would have been a lot higher.' Nash was ordered to pay £400 in total, £210 for the speeding offences and another £170 for court costs and a £20 victim surcharge. He will pay the fine immediately however his lawyer appealed the disqualification. Speaking after the case Mr Lewis said: 'We are appealing because it is too long and unfair.'","Carlo Nash was caught doing 140mph on the A11 in Wymondham, Norwich .

"Big seller: Samsung has had nine million pre-orders for the S3 - but you may be waiting for the blue model . In the history of gadgets, none has picked up such an army of fans before launch. The Samsung Galaxy S3 has already received nine million pre-orders before launch - even with few people getting to play on Android's latest smartphone until it arrives in the UK on May 29. When the phone arrives, it will instantly become the fastest selling gadget in history, beating out the iPhone 4S's four million units sold in three days. It also tops the first iPad's two million tablets in two months, and the Microsoft Kinect system - which allows you to wave at your television via the Xbox 360 games console - which shifted 2.5 million units in 25 days. Samsung has reportedly hired 75,000 workers to keep up with the demand, with the company confident of meeting all pre-orders. The company is said to have the capacity to churn out five million phones per month - or 66 phones per worker per month. Most of the orders will have come through network carriers across the world, based on customer pre-orders, upgrades and anticipated demand. The carriers will have pre-allocated the majority of this stock to customers, with a surplus to act as a 'buffer' in case demand exceeds their supply. In the UK, Carphone Warehouse has confirmed that the S3 is the most popular phone of the year so far, with thousands of customers lined up to pick up their phone a week from today. Spokesman Graham Stapleton said: 'Pre-order demand for the new Galaxy S3 has surpassed expectations since the handset was first unveiled two weeks ago. 'The first 24 hours alone saw thousands placing their pre-order at Carphone Warehouse.' The S3's predecessor - the Galaxy S2 - took about six months to sell 10million phones, and 11 months to sell 20million. The release of the phone is likely to swell the number of Android users - although with the plethora of devices on the operating system, the increase may end up just causing a small spike. There are now in the region of 350million Android users in the world - with an estimated 900,000 to one million people picking up a new Android device each day. The software could be on one billion screens by the end of 2013, according to some estimates. Apple have not released recent figures for iOS usage - both iPhones and iPads - but in early 2011 the total was believed to be about 110million. Microsoft is notoriously quiet on the number of sales of Windows Phone 7, but it is believed to have shipped about 10 million phones since the operating system launched two years ago, giving them just a fraction - 1.3 per cent - of the market. Although, to be fair to Microsoft, they might not even need a phone version of Windows - due to patent and licensing agreements, Microsoft makes between $5 and $15 on most sales of Android phones, compared to the estimated $3 which goes into Google's pockets per handset through advertising revenue each year. Competition: The iPhone 4S is Apple's current model, while Nokia is trying hard with the Lumia WP7 phone . However Nokia is relying on Windows Phone 7, having invested heavily in the operating system as it begins to phase out the 'Symbian' OS which has powered much of the manufacturer's range of phones. Apple and Samsung between them account for 49.3 per cent of all smartphone sales worldwide - an increase on the 29 per cent the two had in early 2011. The S3 is Samsung's latest flagship phone. Despite the record pre-orders it will face substantial competition from HTC's One series of phones, and the always strong-selling iPhone range. The Samsung's most innovative feature is built-in face-tracking and voice control - allowing, Samsung claims, for a more 'natural' control system. It will also pay tribute to Samsung's expertise in screens, with a large 4.8-inch Super AMOLED screen running a resolution of 1280 x 720p - far bigger than Apple’s iPhone, and close in size to the smaller end of the tablet market. Other innovations include what Samsung claims is a 'more intelligent' lock system, that keeps the screen 'awake' when the phone’s camera senses eyes watching it, rather than turning it off. The next iPhone is not due before the Autumn, traditionally launching around October. It is rumoured to come with a four-inch screen, and may be joined by a new addition to the iRange - an iPad Mini.","S3 will be fastest selling gadget in history .

"Cristiano Ronaldo may have picked up his second consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or award earlier this month, but what will no doubt be a memorable night for the Real Madrid star is probably remembered more by others for that celebration. True to form, the world of social media picked up on his 'roar' of glory when he lifted the illustrious World Player of the Year gong, cutting him into videos with the likes of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry.

"President Barack Obama and the vacationing first family skipped the beach in Hawaii on Sunday to take in a college basketball game. The President, first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia were in attendance at the Oregon State-Akron game as part of the Diamond Head Classic tournament in Honolulu. The game held particular interest for the Obamas, as Oregon State is coached by Michelle's brother, Craig Robinson, although at times the first lady and the girls didn't look as excited to be watching the game as the president did. Scroll down for video . Happy Holidays! President Obama took the first family to see a college basketball game on Sunday, but the first lady, pictured yawning, Sasha, with her head on her knee, and Malia, second from right, seemed less than impressed by the action . The Obamas drew a standing ovation and loud cheers as they walked in to the small arena at the University of Hawaii . Can we go now? President Barack Obama and the vacationing first family skipped the beach in Hawaii on Sunday to take in a college basketball game . The president had every reason to smile as he received a much warmer welcome in his home state than he did the last time he took his family to a basketball game back in November. Then he had been greeted with boos as the family had sat down to watch Oregon State take on the University of Maryland, but in Hawaii the president is treated very much like a returning hero. The Obamas drew a standing ovation and loud cheers as they walked in to the small arena at the University of Hawaii. Fans took pictures while press photographers and videographers crowded an entrance to take pictures. Throughout the game, some fans ignored the action on the floor and watched the president instead. Sasha and Malia enjoy some hotdogs, while the president and first lady take in the action . The Obamas sat just behind the Oregon State bench, with the president sitting in between his wife and his friend Bobby Titcomb. The game held particular interest for the Obamas, as Oregon State is coached by Michelle's brother, Craig Robinson . The arena beefed up security because of the president, screening players and cheerleaders and their belongings with metal detectors in the hours before the tournament tipped off. In the past President Obama, a noted basketball fan and recreational player, has been something of a lucky charm for his brother-in-law’s team. Before Sunday he had seen them win 4-0, although on Sunday Akon beat Oregon 83:71. The Obamas sat just behind the Oregon State bench, with the president sitting in between his wife and his friend Bobby Titcomb. Every year, Obama and his family return to his birth state on the sun-scorched shores of Oahu. And every year - until now - congressional squabbling has forced the Obamas to delay their trip or cut it short. This year, Obama was cleared for an on-time departure by Congress, which defied pessimistic expectations last week by passing a bipartisan budget deal, all but ensuring the government won't shut down over the next two years. Take me to the golf course, driver! Obama covered up with a hat and sunglasses as he was taken to a local Marine Corps base for a round of golf with friends . Holiday starts now: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama disembark Air Force One after arriving at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for their family Christmas vacation on Friday, Dec. 20, 2013, in Honolulu . US President Barack Obama(2nd-L) First Lady Michelle (L) and their daughters Malia (R) and Sasha (2nd-R) disembark Air Force One at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Honolulu, Hawaii, on December 20, 2013 . It was a far cry from presaging a new . era of cooperation, to be sure, but a silver lining for Obama a day . earlier as he acknowledged a year of frustrating 'ups and downs' in an . end-of-year news conference. The president, first lady Michelle . Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia, and first dogs Sunny and Bo hopped an . overnight flight on Friday aboard Air Force One to Honolulu, where they . were whisked by motorcade to a beachside home in Kailua, a sleepy suburb . with a five-mile stretch of beach popular among windsurfers and . tourists. The next . morning Obama, typically an early riser, got a late start, staying at . the home until early afternoon, when he headed to the golf course at a . nearby Marine Corps base. Joining Obama for the round of golf were Sam . Kass, the White House chef; Marvin Nicholson, Obama's trip director; and his friend Titcomb, the White House said. Obama, . in white golf shirt, hat and sunglasses, was all smiles as he drove . past reporters accompanying him to the coastal golf course.

President Barack Obama, second from left, and first lady Michelle Obama, left, meet with various representatives of the military after disembarking from Air Force One at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam . The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers $100,000 . The president has no public events scheduled during his vacation, which is expected to last through January 5. In previous years, frequent golf outings have accompanied trips to local restaurants and other island outings. A few weeks of low-key rest and relaxation would be a welcome change of pace for Obama, who reflected on a high-stakes year of brinkmanship and health care woes as he packed his bags for Hawaii. 'The end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Obama said Friday. 'I'm sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.' Last year, Obama had to temporarily abandon his vacation to fly home amid a congressional standoff over the so-called fiscal cliff. The year before, a showdown over payroll tax cuts forced him to delay the start of his Hawaii hiatus. In 2010, it was congressional wrangling over repeal of the ban on gays in the military and other issues that delayed the trip. And in 2009, Senate deliberations over Obama's signature health care law meant that Honolulu had to wait another few days. Christmas traditions: The Obama will surely stop by Island Snow in Kailua for some shaved ice, as they did in 2010 (pictured) The Obama's will cover the cost of their accommodation, but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill . Conditions seem ripe this year for a few weeks of interrupted family time. Obama did spend part of Saturday morning conferring with top national security aides about the situation in South Sudan, where U.S. military aircraft evacuating Americans from the violence-plagued African nation came under gunfire and had to divert to Uganda. The White House said four U.S. troops were injured in that incident. Throughout his vacation Obama will continue to get regular briefings from advisers traveling with him, White House officials said. Obama and his supporters were hoping those routine updates wouldn't interfere with regular rounds of golf and family outings for shave ice, the Hawaii version of a snow cone. 'I don't want any interruptions. He deserves a vacation,' Brian Pritchett, an assistant principal visiting from Mount Vernon, New York, said as he sipped a rum-infused drink dubbed the 'Obama Mama' at a Honolulu hotel. 'He puts in too many hours to not have his vacation with his family. I know that's what I would do.'

"The government is taking action against the makers of a portable baby recliner called the Nap Nanny after five infant deaths. The Consumer Product Safety Commission filed an administrative complaint on Wednesday alleging that the new model of the Nap Nanny, called the Chill, and two earlier versions 'pose a substantial risk of injury and death to infants.' The commission is seeking an order that would require Nap Nanny maker Baby Matters LLC of Berwyn, Pennsylvania, to notify the public about what the agency deems a serious product defect. Baby danger: An administrative complaint against Nap Nanny alleging that the new model, called the Chill, and two earlier versions 'pose a substantial risk of injury and death to infants' The agency also wants the company to offer consumers a full refund. Baby Matters went out of business a month ago, according to an email from the company. On its website is a message from owner and founder Leslie Gudel that says, 'We do not believe the complaint has merit and stand behind the safety of our product when used as instructed.' She adds that 'no infant using the Nap Nanny properly has ever suffered an injury requiring medical attention.' Some of the cases involved recliners that were placed in a crib, which the company has urged parents not to do. Shuttered: Baby Matters, the company that makes Nap Nanny, went out of business a month ago at the height of the recalls . The Nap Nanny should be placed on the floor with the harness secured. The first two versions of the foam recliner were recalled in July 2010 when the agency was aware of one death and 22 reports of infants hanging out or falling over the side of the Nap Nanny even though most of the infants had been placed in the recliner's harness. Since then, the agency has learned of 4 more deaths. Four are linked to the first versions of the recliner, and one to the newer model. In all, the CPSC says it has received over 70 reports of children nearly falling out of the recliners. Hazard: Pictured here is the second generation version of the Nap Nanny. This model and the first generation have been linked to four infant deaths . The commission filed the complaint after discussions with the company broke down over a recall plan. The Nap Nanny was designed to mimic the curves of a baby car seat, elevating an infant slightly to help reduce reflux, gas, stuffiness or other problems. Five thousand Nap Nanny Generation One and 50,000 Generation Two models were sold between 2009 and early 2012. About 100,000 Chill models have been sold since January 2011.","Baby Matters, who makes Nap Nanny, shuttered a month ago amid the massive product recall .

"Guilty: Christopher Haughton tried to kill two police officers with a meat cleaver . A judge today praised police officers seriously injured by a deranged knifeman who turned a halal butchers shop into a bloodbath. Christopher Haughton, 33, seriously injured three officers and attacked the colleagues who tried to save them. Judge Peter Beaumont, the Recorder of London, said the officers showed courage, as he ordered Haughton to be detained without limit of time under the Mental Health Act. He asked for his comments to be passed on to the Metropolitan Police commissioner. Police constables Alistair Hinchliff, Thomas Harding and Andrew Robb needed surgery and months of treatment after the attack in November last year. Judge Beaumont said: 'It seems appropriate to draw to the attention of the commissioner the court’s appreciation of the very considerable courage of the three police officers. 'All three acted in a very difficult situation with very considerable courage and the public is in their debt.' He also praised Sergeant David Weir, the senior officer at the scene, who was in a police vehicle when a breeze block was thrown at the windscreen. The judge said: 'The court expresses its appreciation of the determination and skill he displayed in a situation which was in danger of unravelling out of control.' Haughton, a paranoid schizophrenic, watched the proceedings from a videolink from Broadmoor secure hospital where he is detained. In a letter, his mother Angela apologised to the officers on behalf of her family. She said Haughton had been calm and loving before becoming ill. Haughton, of Wembley, north London, was convicted at the Old Bailey this week of the attempted murders of PCs Hinchliff and Harding. He was also found guilty of assaulting six other officers, including causing grievous bodily harm to PC Robb. Haughton caused minor injuries to two female officers during an incident in October last year. Attacked: Pictured left to right are Alastair Hinchliff, Andrew Robb, John Charlton, Tom Harding and Sham Haque who were involved in the incident in a butcher's . He was allowed bail but in November he caused chaos when he launched his knife attack in Kingsbury, north London. He was heard chanting ‘God help me to kill my enemies’ moments before the attack. The police were called and when two . officers tried to speak to him, the 33-year-old, who was armed with a . ten-inch butcher’s knife, refused to calm down and bit one of them on . the arm before throwing bricks at him injuring his hand. Stabbing: The knife used by Haughton who has been detained without limit for his attack on several policeman . As . back-up arrived, Haughton made his way towards the butcher’s shop but . stopped to throw a breeze block at the patrol car’s windscreen and tins . of baked beans grabbed from a shop at pursuing officers. He . then stormed into a Halal butchers screaming 'Give me a chopper! Give . me a chopper!' before he grabbed the knife and turned on officers who . feared he may attack innocent workers or shoppers. One officer, PC Thomas Harding, tried to . pin him down with a riot shield but Haughton managed to straddle him . and repeatedly stabbed the officer who wore a stab proof vest until one . blow pierced below the protection into his bowel. As another officer, PC Alastair . Hinchliff, pushed Haughton off PC Harding, he too fell to the floor and . Haughton slashed him across the left side of his face from temple to ear . with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth. Evidence: PC Stephen Barker, seen arriving at the Old Bailey, said Christopher Haughton bit him and tore his sleeve off with his teeth . He then stabbed PC Hinchliff in the . upper and lower arm exposing the muscle and tendons of the arm as other . officers struck him with their batons with no effect. Haughton then lashed out twice cutting across PC Andre Robb’s knee. 'Despite . his continued violence' officers managed to pin him against the meat . counter but as they tried to cuff him, Haughton attempted to stab PC . Shaun Haque in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists. Edward Brown QC, prosecuting, told the court that some of the officers now found it difficult to attend incidents where a knife might be involved. Incident: Police cordoned off the scene after the stabbings in Kingsbury, north west London. Medical supplies can be seen strewn across the road . PC Harding had nine inches of . intestine removed after he was stabbed in the stomach through a shield . after being pinned on the ground. He suffered 'unspeakable pain' and thought he was going to die. PC Hinchliff, who was stabbed in the face and arm when he went to help his colleague, said he had been left with scars on his face. Mr Brown said: 'He tends to shy away from incidents when mention is made of someone carrying a knife.' Attack: As police tried to put Haughton into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck . He told the trial: 'It was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives.' Detective Inspector Keely Smith said later: 'Without the intervention of other officers at the scene who were able to eventually restrain Haughton, the outcome could have been very different.' In pre-trial legal hearings Haughton . claimed he was Jesus Christ and police were trying to stop him in his . work of urging gang members to lay down their arms. Haughton claimed he was insane and had acted in the way he did because police were trying to kill him. Haughton was also convicted of ABH on . WPC Vicky Vincent and common assault on WPC Alison Spruce just a month . before in October 2011. Police had been called to Haughton’s . bedsit in Streatham, south London, as he played loud music, brandished a . samurai sword and threatened other residents forcing them to flee. When one resident complained about the . music, Haughton pushed him down the stairs and then tried to kick in all . the bedsit doors, causing £2,500 of damage. When officers arrived he charged at . them armed with a broom and in the violent struggle officers had to use . CS spray to subdue him. However, he still managed to bite WPC . Vincent in her thigh drawing blood and only let go when another officer . whacked him on his shoulders with a baton. He then spat blood into WPC Alison Spruce’s face.","Christopher Haughton lashed out at officers with a ten-inch butcher's knife .

"Prosecutors Friday . were waiting for the results of a police investigation into the killing . of a burglar by an 80-year-old California homeowner who says he shot the . woman in the back as she fled his home and ran down an alley, the . district attorney's office said. Long Beach . resident Tom Greer, 80, told KNBC-TV that the burglar had said she was . pregnant and asked Greer not to fire, but he shot her twice in the back . anyway. An autopsy later found that Andrea Miller, 28, was not pregnant, said coroner's spokesman Ed Winter. Scroll down for video . Attack: Tom Greer said he shot a woman breaking into his home despite her claiming she was pregnant, but recent reports reveal she was not expecting a child . Gus Adams has already been charged in the death of Andrea Miller, who was breaking into Greer's home with him when the elderly resident caught the couple, resulting in Miller's death . 'Long . Beach police are still investigating,' said Sarah Ardalani, spokeswoman . for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 'It's ongoing, . and so we're waiting at this point.' Prosecutors . filed murder, burglary, robbery and weapons charges against Gus Adams, . 26, a suspected accomplice of Miller. He was being held on bail of more . than $1 million. A court appearance initially set for Friday was rescheduled for next month. The . murder charge is possible because Adams is accused of participating in a . felony that led to a death, said Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell. Police . said Friday that Adams' mother, Ruby Adams, also was involved, and she . was arrested Thursday night on suspicion of robbery. They gave no . details on her alleged role or the evidence against her. McDonnell . said the homeowner came home around 9 p.m. Tuesday and surprised Adams . and Miller, who were trying to break into a safe. They assaulted him, . breaking his collarbone, before he was able to get a handgun, the chief . said. Police said he fired shots inside and outside his house. He reportedly told KNBC on Wednesday: '[Miller] says, ""Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm going to have a baby,' and  I shot her anyway.' Greer told NBC 4 he believes he was acting in self defense. He said when . the pair saw he was armed, they allegedly ran out of the house, but . Greer told the TV station that he fired on them, hitting the woman. Break in: Greer claims Miller and Adams assaulted him when he caught them and he was acting in self-defense . He . allegedly added he had no regrets about the shooting, telling KNBC: . 'When the time comes to defend yourself, you best do something.' Under . California law, homeowners have a right to protect themselves with . deadly force inside their homes and in the immediate vicinity - such as a . patio - if they feel they are in imminent danger of great bodily injury . or death, said Lawrence Rosenthal, a former federal prosecutor who . teaches law at Chapman University. But this . case enters a gray area because Greer, by his own account, chased the . burglars and fired at them outside his home as they were fleeing, . Rosenthal said. 'The problem here is that all . this happens very fast and his legal right to use force probably ended . just a few seconds before he did use deadly force,' Rosenthal said. 'So . the question is should you charge somebody on the basis of what really . was a series of split-second decisions when he's just been robbed and . physically assaulted?' McDonnell declined to say how many shots were fired or to confirm that Miller was shot in the back. No phone listing was available for Greer and he could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press.","Autopsy reveals Andrea Miller was not carrying a baby when she was killed .

"The streets of North Korea's showcase capital were filled with runners from all over the world today for the annual Pyongyang marathon. Tens of thousands of North Koreans lined the streets to applaud, cheer and high-five the runners, who were followed by a truck blaring patriotic music. They stood and roared as North Korea's Pak Chol, who completed the men's event in two hours, 12 minutes and 26 seconds, crossed the finish line.

Tourists: Harriet Harper-Jones from London (left) and Allie Wu from Taiwan (right). The sign behind them reads 'Long Live the Shining Revolutionary Tradition of Our Party' Compatriots Kim Hye Gyong and her twin sister, Kim Hye Song, finished first and second in the women's race. The winning women's time was 2:27:04. Known officially as the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, the race was open to foreign amateurs this year for the first time. The race - held annually for 27 years - is sanctioned as a bronze-label event by the International Association of Athletics Federations. Organisers said they decided to allow foreign recreational runners because they wanted to hold a grander race as part of the series of sporting competitions, arts festivals and cultural events marking the birthday of the nation's founder, Kim Il Sung, on April 15. Much of North Korea remains off-limits to foreigners, but Pyongyang, with its broad avenues, plazas and ubiquitous monuments, is more accessible than other places in the secretive and isolated country. The opening of the race to recreational runners is in keeping with the North's ongoing effort to earn cash revenue by boosting tourism, usually with group tours to major arts performances or attractions the North wants to show off. Frontrunner: An elderly North Korean man enters Kim Il Sung Stadium at the last stretch of his run during the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon .

Twin sisters: Kim Hye Gyong (135) and Kim Hye Song (136) take a victory lap together inside Kim Il Sung Stadium after placing first and second in the women's race . Tourism agencies that specialize in North Korea said they were surprised by the large number of entries they received. 'I really wanted to do this race because of the location. The scenery was fantastic, and there were so many people watching' Jen Skym, 32, a pregnant Briton from Manchester living in Hong Kong . But they noted most were from tourists who primarily wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to see Pyongyang close up, rather than compete in the race itself. Officials said runners from 27 countries took part this year, including 225 amateurs. Though the race has long featured elite athletes from around the world, organizers decided to make it easier for fun-runners to join in by requiring only that the course be completed in four hours - so the roads could be reopened - and by also holding a half marathon and a 10km run. ‘I really wanted to do this race because of the location,’ said 10km runner Jen Skym, a 32-year-old Briton from Manchester living in Hong Kong, who is also four months pregnant. Competing: Runners take off from the starting line inside Kim Il Sung Stadium at the beginning of the Pyongyang marathon . Smiling faces: North Korean spectators watch from the roadside in central Pyongyang as runners pass by during the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon . Joy: North Korean spectators watch and cheer from the stands of Kim Il Sung Stadium as runners arrive at the finish of the marathon . ‘The scenery was fantastic, and there were so many people watching. It was good motivation to get back into running. I really enjoyed it.’ 'Usually I would imagine it's the tourists here looking out at the local people. Here, it's them looking at us. We are the show' Jacob Young, of Nova Scotia, Canada . Runners on the generally flat, full-marathon course did four loops around the centre of the city of 2.5million, starting at Kim Il Sung Stadium, moving past the Arch of Triumph, the Friendship Tower and the Kim Il Sung University area. They then crossed a bridge to the east side of the city and wound their way along the river bank to the stadium. The capacity crowd of 42,000 spectators back in the stadium were treated to football games and martial arts exhibitions while they waited for the runners to return. Earlier this year, North Korea's government announced a plan to create special trade and tourism zones across the country and unveiled its first luxury ski resort, aimed largely at luring ski enthusiasts from abroad.

But I don't think it was all that unusual. It was a good experience' Will Erskine, of Melbourne, Australia . Simple recreational sports facilities, such as outdoor basketball courts and roller skating rinks, have been popping up lately in Pyongyang and some other cities. ‘I go to international races every year, but this one just strikes me as the most unique,’ said Jacob Young, of Nova Scotia, Canada. ‘It's very novel. Usually I would imagine it's the tourists here looking out at the local people. Here, it's them looking at us.

Changes: Under the watch of young leader Kim Jong Un (pictured last Wednesday), the North has been giving sports in general a higher profile . To keep the show from getting too colourful, however, the foreign runners were instructed not to carry U.S. or Japanese flags, or wear clothing with large writing or that was deemed inappropriately attention-getting or political - though one wore blue jeans for the 10-kilometer event. Runners said they were also not allowed to carry cameras during the race, though they snapped away afterward inside the stadium. ‘Basically, we just had to wear regular running clothes,’ said Will Erskine, of Melbourne, Australia. ‘Some people might have wanted to shoot pictures the whole time.

"Apple’s Siri is set to get a makeover - and the changes could see the personal assistant app being fitted in your home. The firm recently won a patent that would see the personal assistant app interacting with sensors in different rooms of a house, tracking you as you move around, before carrying out relevant tasks. For example, if Siri knows the time and knows you’re in the front room near a TV, it could remind you to watch your favourite shows. Apple recently won a patent that could see Siri interacting with sensors in the home. For example, people who take medicine regularly could be reminded to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning, or with their main meal in the kitchen at night. An example process is pictured . The patent, details a system in which Apple’s personal assistant app Siri would be used to interact with sensors around a person’s home. For example, people who take medicine regularly could be reminded to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning. If Siri knows the time and knows a homeowner is in their the front room, it could reminder them to watch their favourite shows. Outside of the home, other examples include the assistant being used to: 'assist individuals who are . impaired in some way, including elderly people, and surgeons, whose eyes, hands and brains are . constantly busy when performing operations.' Although the patent doesn’t explicitly . say what the sensors would consist of, signals could be taken from . web-enabled devices already in the home, or bought separately. Future versions, in theory, could reverse the process and be used to control devices or the sensors using Siri. Alternatively, people who take medicine regularly could be given a nudge to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning, or with their main meal in the kitchen at night. Apple’s patent calls the home assistant an ‘active ontology’. Ontology is a term used in computer science to describe a system of 'tasks being carried out using a variety of knowledge bases.' Although the patent doesn’t explicitly say what the sensors would consist of, signals could be taken from web-enabled devices already in the home, or be bought separately. The patent, originally uncovered by Patently Apple, said the assistant would be 'in communication with a plurality of sensors distributed throughout the domain and adapted to convey observed facts relating to the user's behaviour (e.g., ‘the user is in the kitchen’; ‘the user is in the dining room’; ‘the user is in the bathroom’). Another example could be when homeowners go on holiday. Siri would begin by waking them up, or advising how long it will take them to get to the airport, based on current traffic reports. It would scan the calendar to find . flight times, and once the owner is detected near the front door using a . sensor, it would remind the homeowner to remember their passport or . other documents before they leave.

"Looking for the Easter bunny? Here’s one that’s easy to spot. Darius weighs three-and-a-half stone and measures 4ft 4in, making him the world’s biggest rabbit, according to Guinness World Records.

"A man from Birmingham who had swallowed 61 pellets of cocaine to smuggle it into Britain from Antigua sparked an emergency landing as he nearly died after one of the packs burst inside his stomach. Colmin Smith, 48, was travelling on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Antigua to London Gatwick when he fell ill after ingesting what later was discovered to be 239.39 grams of cocaine, worth £40,000 at street value. The Airbus A330 had just left Antigua when Smith informed a flight attendant about what had happened and then lost consciousness. Scroll down for video . Emergency landing: The Virgin Atlantic flight to London Gatwick from Antigua where Colmin Smith was travelling was diverted to Bermuda's L.F. Wade International Airport . After learning about the situation, the crew took action and informed passengers that the Airbus A330 was going to be diverted. The jet performed an emergency landing at Bermuda's L.F. Wade International Airport, where medics were waiting to perform emergency surgery. Smith was then rushed to the island's King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, where a life-saving operation revealed Smith had 239.9 grams of cocaine in his stomach. The drug was said to be 75 per cent pure. Appearing before magistrates on the island Smith said: ‘After I informed the flight attendant, in my mind I died, I felt the death coming. ‘I've met a lot of nice people here, I must thank god and the crew for saving my life.’ Smith admitted one charge of possession of the drug and was fined £471. Drug mule: Colmin Smith had swallowed 239.39 grams of cocaine, worth £40,000 at street value . Senior magistrate Archibald Warner told Smith he should ‘thank his lucky stars’ he was here to face charges rather than dead. Mr Warner said: ‘I guess you were lucky, there are other technical reasons why you've been charged with this, but let's put it down to luck. ‘You should thank whoever you worship, or look to, because you are really lucky. ‘You didn't come to the first heaven, but you came to Bermuda, the second heaven.’ Speaking later a senior member of the island's narcotic unit said: ‘There was no evidence that the drug was to be peddled on Bermuda's streets so he could only be charged with possession. ‘If he had been found guilty of supplying the narcotics he would have been banged up for life. ‘He is one very lucky man. He came close to losing his life, either by overdose or by life sentence. ‘We have dealt with individuals who have consumed 1.5kilos of cocaine and heroin.’ Dwayne Caines, head of communication for the Bermudan Police, added: ‘This case stands out for two reasons, the fact that, quite simply, this man should not be with us and the exorbitant cost of his medical care. He was in hospital for quite a time. ‘Anyone who chooses to be a drug mule is not only taking a huge risk with their health but in this jurisdiction, risking very substantial jail time. After appearing in court and paying the fine, Smith was deported with the help of the British Embassy.","Colmin Smith, 48, swallowed 239.39 grams of cocaine, worth £40,000 at street value before getting on a plane to London from Antigua .

"A forgotten grand altar tapestry made by injured soldiers during the First World War will return to St Paul's Cathedral after more than 70 years. The poignant piece depicting the Holy Grail was painstakingly crafted by 133 casualties who had returned from the trenches, . Blinded, crippled and shell-shocked, they were lying in hospitals around Britain and were encouraged into embroidery by medics who hoped it would distract them and help them recover. A stitch in time: When thousands of injured soldiers were sent home from the trenches of the First World War, many were so shell-shocked they could barely hold their cigarettes - but 133 contributed to this lost tapestry . Symbolic: The tapestry's five panels include the Holy Grail, representing suffering, flanked by two palm leaves . Religious: The tapestry, pictured left in use at the old high altar at St Paul's Cathedral before the Second World War when it was bombed, was stitched by 133 soldiers. One unidentified man is pictured at work on the piece . They created five individual panels, which were stitched together by the Royal School of Art Needlework a year after the war ended. The finished work, a 3m-wide tapestry of the golden grail representing suffering and two palm leaves signifying victory, was presented to St Paul's and rested on the altar for several years. But after the cathedral was bombed in the Second World War, the magnificent piece was put in a chest for safekeeping and remained there for more than seven decades. It has now been restored and will be put on display in August to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War. It will remain on show for four years, the duration of the conflict. The name of every shell-shocked soldier who worked on the altar piece was recorded in a gold-leafed book and St Paul's is hoping to track down surviving relatives. Painstaking: The tapestry gained dust in a chest for more than seven decades and has now been restored . Then and now: St Paul's today and after it was hit in an air raid during the Blitz on London in April 1941 . One of them was George Eades, who was blinded in France in 1917 but became a 'finished artiste' in embroidery at St Dunstan's Hospital for the Blind in Kensington, London. The Reverend Canon Michael Hampel, precentor of St Paul's Cathedral, said: 'The hands that clung to life in the trenches of the First World War and which lifted the bodies of dead comrades into graves came home to craft this beautiful altar frontal. 'It is a symbol of faith despite everything and a deeply moving tribute to those who did not return. 'It is our privilege at St Paul's to let it stand as a memorial to the sacrifice, courage and legacy of a world at war and we are very keen to identify some of these men and learn of their stories.' It is not known whether the work was originally commissioned by St Paul's, but the altar frontal was dedicated to the cathedral at a special service after the war had ended. The Royal School of Needlework was the main driver behind the project. The list of names, regiments and ranks, meanwhile, is being digitised so they and colourful illuminations which accompany them can be seen and searched via the cathedral website.

"Two thirds of British families say they sit down together for a family meal almost every day, yet for many there are uninvited guests at the table. On average 11.4 million tech devices such as smartphones and tablets to laptops and iPods are brought to family meals. Almost a quarter of families (22 per cent) who bring tech to the table feel they are prevented from having proper conversations with each other at meal times, seriously impacting on what should be quality time together. Almost half of mothers have resorted to forcibly removing technology from dinner by either banning or hiding it . Children and young teenagers are the worst offenders, with a third (34 per cent) of 5-to-15-year-olds regularly bringing some form of tech device to family meals. According to the new research of 2,000 parents, technology is also limiting the amount of time families spend together during meal times. For one in five (19 per cent) families dinner has become a functional and rushed occasion frequented by regular arguments. Once at the dinner table, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter (56 per cent); and messaging apps and emails (48 per cent) are the biggest distractions. The result is that conversation with nearest and dearest is killed, in favour of digital communication with friends further afield. In an attempt to combat the barrier technology creates around meal times, 16 per cent of mothers admit to actually texting or messaging their kids to get them to the dinner table. Almost half (43 per cent) of mothers are also so fed up that they have resorted to forcibly removing technology from the dinner table by either banning it, or completely hiding it. Almost a quarter of families  who bring tech to the table are prevented from having proper conversations . Three quarters of mothers (76 per cent) believe that spending meal times together is important for family bonding, but find that getting their family to the dinner table challenging (37 per cent). The effort that goes into preparing dinner, combined with a perceived lack of appetite and interest from the family, leaves two thirds of UK mothers feeling both frustrated and upset (69 per cent). Parenting expert Liz Fraser said: 'Technology has been in family homes for decades; but mobile tech means it comes with us everywhere we go - and, sadly, that often includes mealtimes. 'Previously nobody would have brought a television to the dinner table, or eaten their breakfast while on the phone in the hallway. 'Meal times are absolutely vital for family bonding, developing social skills, and sharing stories from the day. Making them a little bit different and fun are great ways to keep everyone's focus in the room and rediscover the pleasure in just spending time with each other.' A spokesperson for Mexican food brand Old El Paso, who commissioned the research, said: 'The problem of technology at the dinner table appears to be an increasing problem as our lives become more mobile. 'However, meal times are an important part of family life and should be a fun opportunity for everyone to get stuck in together.'

"Advanced health care systems mean a major Ebola epidemic in the West is unlikely according to the World Health Organisation. Dr Christopher Dye, WHO director of strategy said while the fact Ebola has spread to the West is a major concern it is unlikely to be a major problem. He said: 'The possibility that once an infection has been introduced that it spreads elsewhere, is something that everybody is going to be concerned about.' Scroll down for video . Staff from the Centers for Disease Control are training healthcare workers in how to deal with Ebola safely . In Liberia, health workers routinely sterilise each other hafter handling the bodies of Ebola victims . Speaking to BBC News, he said: 'We're confident that in North America and Western Europe where health systems are very strong, that we're unlikely to see a major outbreak in any of those places.' According to Dr Tom Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control the chance of a major Ebola outbreak in the US is incredibly low, despite the latest confirmed cases of the disease in Texas. He said: 'The United States has a strong health care system and dedicated public health professionals — all hard at work right now — to make sure this case will not threaten the community at large, or the nation. 'A person who is sick from Ebola virus disease can be cared for in U.S. hospitals when the patient is isolated in a private room with a private bathroom and contact with them is highly controlled. Every health care worker must meticulously follow every single infection control protection we recommend.' Dr Thomas Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control tried to reassure Americans that they are not at risk . US President Barack Obama said the chances of Americans contracting the virus was 'extremely low'. He has held meetings with the Centers for Disease Control at the White House to discuss the crisis and the correct response to any future Ebola cases. He said: 'First of all, what I’ve directed the CDC to do is that as soon as somebody is diagnosed with Ebola, we want a rapid response team, a SWAT team, essentially, from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible -- hopefully within 24 hours -- so that they are taking the local hospital step by step through exactly what needs to be done and making sure that all the protocols are properly observed; that the use of protective equipment is done effectively; that disposal of that protective equipment is done properly.'

"The Federal Communications Commission has voted to go forward with the proposal of new rules that could let Internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users. The controversial 'fast lane' rules has received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open Internet advocates. Outside the hearing protesters banged drums and held up signs calling for net neutrality, while at least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners. Scroll down for video . Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Tom Wheeler: The FCC has voted in favor of a proposal to reform net neutrality and could allow Internet service providers to charge for faster and higher-quality service. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability. This is being heavily criticised by net neutrality campaigners. At the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. All this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment. Although it seems like a fair model, in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money, campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition. For example, Netflix has the money to pay for better service, using the fast lanes, while smaller companies don't. This means smaller companies may have the same range of content, but because they can't stream at the same quality, they are effectively priced out of the market. To address these claims, the new rules include a 'competition test'. ISPs would need to decide if a website meets the critieria to be given priority access and that this bar must be set high enough to protect competition. The preliminary vote, in which three of agency's commissioners supported the measure and two dissented, moves the so-called 'net neutrality' rules into a formal public comment period. After the 120-day period ends, the FCC will revise the proposal and vote on a final set of rules. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said he wants the rules in place by the end of this year. 'Today we take another step in what has been a decade-long effort to protect a free and open Internet,' Wheeler, a Democrat, said before the vote. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability. But the idea of allowing priority access, even if it's regulated by the government, has received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open Internet advocates. Outside the hearing protesters banged drums and held up signs calling for net neutrality. At least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners. Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, who voted no, called the proposed rules a ""regulatory boondoggle,"" arguing that supporters of the rules haven't shown they will help consumers. And Commissioner Ajit Pai, who also voted no, said the issue would be better decided by Congress than by five unelected officials. But since the issue has fallen on the commission, he argued that a group of economists from across the country should do peer-reviewed studies and host a series of public hearings to hammer out their differences before a decision is made. 'In short, getting the future of the Internet right is more important than getting this done right now,' Pai said. Tighe Barry of CodePink (L), along with other demonstrators, protest outside the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). At least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners. A previous set of rules from 2010 was struck down by an appeals court in January after Verizon challenged them. The FCC says the rules currently proposed follow the blueprint set forth by that court decision. In addition, the commission will consider the possibility of defining Internet service providers as ""common carriers,"" like telephone companies, which are subject to greater regulation than Internet providers, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC and Wheeler have so far avoided subjecting cable and telecoms companies to Title II treatment, although Wheeler has said the option remains on the table. Netflix has found success with original . content including House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, as well as . the streaming of other TV shows and films. To stream these shows, it uses a large amount of bandwith - much more than standard text and videos on webpages, for example. Under the plans for priority lanes, Netflix would pay extra to use these lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain or improve the streaming quality and reliability. Earlier this month Netflix raised its prices in Europe, the UK and the U.S by €1, £1 and $1 respectively. Customers of Netflix, which has produced shows including House of Cards (pictured), could be charged more to stream programmes if the website chooses to pay more for a better service . This price rise applies to new customers only, while existing customers will remain on the old price for two years. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has broadened the scope of his proposed open internet rules and suggested tougher standards for internet providers who wish to create paid priority fast lanes on their networks. According to an FCC official, Wheeler made revisions after the commission received 35,000 public comments - many of them expressing outrage. Wheeler, a Democrat, also tweaked his proposal after the commission's two other Democrats expressed concern. 'The new draft clearly reflects public input the commission has received,' the FCC official said in a statement. 'The draft is explicit that the goal is to find the best approach to ensure the Internet remains open and prevent any practices that threaten it.' Netflix, which has also released Orange is the New Black, could be made to pay more to use priority fast lanes on ISP networks . Among the additions is a provision that would 'presume' it to be illegal for an internet provider to prioritise the traffic of an affiliated service - for example, it would be considered illegal if Comcast tried to give faster treatment to video streams of its subsidiary network, NBC. However, an internet service provider would be allowed to challenge that 'presumption,' the official said. In the revised proposal, Wheeler also seeks comment on the possibility of treating broadband providers as so-called 'common carriers' like telephone companies, which are subject to greater regulation than Internet providers, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC and Wheeler have so far avoided subjecting cable and telecoms companies to Title II treatment, although Wheeler has said the option remains on the table. In the new proposal, he entertains more discussion on it than his initial proposal did. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has broadened the scope of his proposed open Internet rules and suggested tougher standards for internet providers who wish to create paid priority fast lanes on their networks . The proposal also asks whether all paid-priority fast lanes should be banned outright. The previous version only asks if some paid-priority services should be banned. Wheeler has faced a torrent of criticism after the earlier proposal made it appear as if he was overhauling the principle of net neutrality, which says internet service providers should not be allowed to discriminate against web traffic depending on its source. Such discrimination could result if a phone company like AT&T slowed down traffic from phone services like Skype, or if Comcast slowed Netflix video speeds to favour its own online video service, Xfinity.

"Wracked with grief and despair, a woman weeps for the loss of her relative in the poverty-stricken slums of Monrovia. With little healthcare or education to speak of, there is nothing residents can do except watch as their loved ones succumb to the deadly Ebola virus ravaging the city. Crippled by poverty and still reeling from the effects of a devastating civil war, Liberia is ill-equipped to deal with a potential human catastrophe on this scale. Scroll down for video . Wracked with grief, a woman weeps for the loss of her relative in the poverty-stricken slums of Monrovia . Crippled by poverty and still reeling from the effects of a devastating civil war, Liberia is ill-equipped to deal with a potential human catastrophe on this scale . The latest statistics from the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) place the death toll from the Ebola virus outbreak at 4,447, with the vast majority of those fatalities in West Africa. More than half the dead have been in Liberia. The country's slum-dwelling population are some of the hardest hit by the epidemic which has sent shockwaves across West Africa and the world. WHO assistant director-general Dr. Bruce Aylward said the U.N. health agency was still focused on trying to treat Ebola patients, despite the huge demands on the broken health systems in West Africa. A Liberian boy reacts after being injured during clashes with Liberian security forces in the West Point area of Monrovia.  Residents were protesting against government's decision to quarantine the slum area .

'It would be horrifically unethical to say that we're just going to isolate people,' he said, noting that new strategies like handing out protective equipment to families and setting up very basic clinics - without much treatment - was a priority. A planned strike at Ebola treatment centers was averted as most nurses and health care workers reported for work. Many saying they could not in good conscience leave their patients unattended. Health workers have been asking for increased hazard pay. They are one of the most high-risk groups of Ebola infection, with nearly 100 of them having died in Liberia alone. Red Cross members carry dead body of Mambodou Aliyu, 35, who died from the Ebola virus in Monrovia . A Liberian ambulance team prepare transport suspected Ebola patient Francis Konneh, 70 . 'We have called for the strike action to be called off on humanitarian grounds,' said George Williams, secretary-general of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia. 'Our doors are open for negotiations at a later date...but as of now we call off the action based on numerous appeals from the Liberian people both home and the diaspora.' Lori Thicke, founder of non-profit organization Translators Without Borders, said one of the main problems containing Ebola in the West African nation is the lack of communication in the poorest areas. 'In Liberia only 20 per cent of the population speaks English,' she said. 'People at the bottom of the pyramid - such as those who live in the slums of Monrovia - are even less likely to be conversant in a European language such as English. Red Cross members sterilize each other before they pick up the dead body of Mambodou Aliyu in Monrovia . 'Ebola is spread by ignorance, and communicating with people in a foreign tongue is not getting the message across. 'Trust is another issue,' she added. 'People are not trusting these messages that arrive in a language they barely understand, leading to the widespread notion that Ebola is not real.' WHO has said that the epidemic is continuing to spread in the three worst-hit nations - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - and there could be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases a week by early December. The deadly virus has also reached Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far. Dr. Aylward said that the 70 per cent death rate of Ebola was 'a high mortality disease' in any circumstance. Previously, WHO had said the death rate was around 50 per cent.

"The U.S. economy was today boosted again as the labour market continues to firm up, with the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits falling unexpectedly last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 15,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 358,000, and the four-week moving average for new claims fell 11,000 to 366,250, the U.S. Labor Department said. The average figure, seen as a better measure of labour market trends, is now at its lowest level since April 2008. The initial claims measure is close behind, at its second-lowest level in almost four years. Getting better: People wait in line to enter a job fair employer hiring event for Safeway, in Portland, Oregon. The number of people seeking unemployment aid declined to a nearly four-year low last week . ‘It does look like with these numbers that the labour market is on a positive footing,’ New York analyst Sean Incremona said. ‘Job creation is probably going to be what keeps this recovery alive.’ ‘Things do seem to be holding up somewhat better than we had expected,’ the 4Cast expert added. The data points to building strength in the labour market. There have been two straight months of job gains above 200,000 and the jobless rate dropped to a three-year low of 8.3 per cent in January. Solid gains in employment and manufacturing are suggesting against a sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter of 2012 after a brisk 2.8 per cent annual pace in the final three months of 2011. IFR Economics analyst Vimombi Nshom said: ‘Even though claims have had bumpy readings, the average has fallen more consistently. So, less people are looking into unemployment benefits.’ Falling: Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 15,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 358,000, and the four-week moving average for new claims fell 11,000 to 366,250 . The upbeat data is raising doubts about the Federal Reserve's expectation of holding interest rates near zero at least to 2014 and reduced the odds of more bond buying to spur the U.S. recovery. 'It does look like with these numbers that the labour market is on a positive footing. Job creation is probably going to be what keeps this recovery alive' Sean Incremona, New York analyst . Last week's decline in both new applications for jobless benefits and the four-week average pushed them closer to the 350,000 mark that would signal sustained labour market strength. ‘It's great news,’ said futures analyst Frank Lesh, of Futurepath Trading in Chicago, Illinois. ‘Claims continue to look better every week, every month - the headline number is great.’ Despite the continued improvement, the labour market still has a long away to go. Almost 24million Americans are out of work or underemployed. There is no job for three in every four jobless people. One reason the jobless rate has fallen . for five straight months is many people no longer looking for work. The . government only counts people as unemployed if they are actively . searching for a job. Wall Street: U.S. stocks opened higher on Thursday after Greek leaders agreed to cost-cutting measures that should prevent the country from defaulting on its debt next month . Jacob Oubina, of RBC Capital Markets in New York, warned: ‘The seasonal volatility from around the holidays is going to disappear so we'll have a much cleaner set of numbers in the weeks ahead.’ 'It's great news. Claims continue to look better every week, every month - the headline number is great' Frank Lesh, Chicago analyst . Most economists expect growth will slow slightly in the January to March quarter, because companies won't need to rebuild their stockpiles of goods as much as they did in the winter. But some economists are increasingly optimistic that the economy will steadily expand this year, given last month's unexpectedly large job gains and other positive signs. U.S. stocks opened higher on Thursday after Greek leaders agreed to cost-cutting measures that should prevent the country from defaulting on its debt next month, before falling back later in the day.

"Nidar Singh Nihang has devoted his life to the mysterious Sikh martial art of Shastar Vidiya. Having learned his skills from an 80-year-old Indian guru, he is now seeking an apprentice to keep the ancient art alive. But he insists that any budding warrior wanting to follow in his footsteps must travel to his home - in Wolverhampton. Poised: Nidar Singh Nihang is the last surviving master of Shastar Vidiya, a Sikh martial art . Sikhism is the fifth-largest . organised religion in the world, with around 26million followers, most . of whom originated in the Punjab region of the Indian sub-continent. It . is considerably younger than any other major religion, having started . with the teachings of Guru Nanak in the late 15th century. One of Sikhism's most famous features is the kirpan, a curved dagger supposed to be carried (but rarely used) by all proponents of the religion. The importance of this weapon fits the Sikh ideal of the Sant-Sipahi or 'warrior saint'. All Sikh men are given the name Singh, meaning 'lion'. The martial art of Shastar Vidiya started with the dawn of the Sikh Empire in the 17th century, when the new religion was under attack from neighbouring Hindus and Muslims. Sikhs quickly gained a reputation for being crack warriors, particularly the Akali Nihang sect - Nihang, a name now carried by many Sikhs, means 'crocodile'. When the Sikh Empire was suppressed by the British colonisers after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in the mid-19th century, not only was Shastar Vidiya banned, but the blue turbans which marked out Akali Nihangs was also prohibited. The 45-year-old former factory worker is looking for someone to inherit both his unique knowledge and his armoury of amazing weapons. He said: 'Shastar Vidiya is a part of my history and culture and without it we lose our character. It has changed history and produced great warriors - for it to die out now would be a tragedy. 'Throughout the day, no matter what I am doing, Shastar Vidiya is always in my mind. 'I am the last known remaining master - it is my mission in life now to find a successor to carry on this great martial art. If I die with it, it is all gone.' Nidar conducts a rigorous daily routine, awakening at dawn to recite ancient mantras followed by seven hours of writing and study. After a late siesta listening to classical Indian music, the expert swordsman embarks on six hours of martial yoga and Shastar Vidiya, before mediation and sleep at 2am. The basis of Shastar Vidiya - the . 'science of weapons' - is a five-step movement: advance on the opponent, . hit his flank, deflect incoming blows, take a commanding position and . strike. It was developed by Sikhs in the 17th . century when their fledgling religion was coming under attack, but it . was forced underground when the British banned Sikhs from using arms . after the first Anglo-Sikh War. In . 1984, Nidar met Mohinder Singh, the last remaining master of Shastar . Vidiya, while working on his aunt's farm in the remote village of . Shadipur in the Indian Punjab. He said: 'The master was from the next village - he saw my physique and asked me if I wanted to learn Shastar Vidiya. 'He got me to attack him with a . stick, but before I knew it I was on the floor. I thought it might be a . fluke, but I did it over and over again and each time he threw me around . like a rag doll. 'I was awestruck because I was 17 and he was in his 80s. 'I . stayed for 11 years, milking the buffalos in the morning and spending . the remainder of the day training with my master and learning the . philosophy. 'I then returned to Wolverhampton in 1995 to marry my wife Satinderjat. 'When . my master Mohinder died later that year, I became the last Sikh warrior . - now I am looking for someone to succeed me. I will teach them here in . my home in the Midlands so they will have to travel here.' The father-of-four warrior master sits with his fearsome array of weapons next to the telly in his Wolverhampton home . Nidar gave up his day-job in a food factory in 2002 to become a full-time writer and teacher of Shastar Vidiya. He is now the ninth gurdev (teacher) of a school established in 1661, called the 'Baba Darbara Singh Shastar Vidoya Akhara'. Well-armed: Nidar's collection of weapons is full of antiques which have actually been used in battle . He lectures worldwide and teaches his pupils how to use swords, daggers and spears, most of which were used in historical battles. Nidar said: 'Ninety-five per cent of our weapons are antiques, from as far back as the 16th century - they've all been passed down through various families. 'The fighting is geared towards a lethal outcome, but it takes many years of training before students are allowed to handle a blade.' Students of the martial art achieve 'master' status, which can take decades, when they are deemed ready by living masters. He said: 'The current group of people who practise the martial art have all been taught by me - without my teaching, they would not know it and Shastar Vidiya would be on the brink of extinction. 'Although learning can last a lifetime, and more, I have become a master after fully committing myself to the martial art - at least 70 hours of training a week for almost 30 years. 'My students show promise but are only at the first rung of the ladder. After all, they haven't been training for more than seven or eight years maximum - and that's only for 10 to 15 hours a week. 'To become a master of Shastar Vidiya takes decades of dedication, often as the sole student of one master.'

"A Dutch airline boss found himself threatened with a one-way ticket to Siberia after relieving himself on a fence outside Vladimir Putin’s Sochi home. Atilay Uslu, who runs Corendon Dutch Airlines, a sponsor of the Dutch Olympic speed skating team, was returning from a night out when he found himself in need of the bathroom. Mr Uslu decided to use a fence for aim, but was soon surrounded by Russian soldiers. Atilay Uslu, chief of an airline sponsoring the Dutch speed skating team, had been out celebrating when he used Putin's fence as a bathroom . The incident took place around 2am on Sunday morning after Uslyu and a friend had been out in Sochi celebrating the success of the Dutch skaters. It emerged that the fence he was using as a ‘bathroom’ protected the villa of the Russian President in the Winter Olympics resort. ‘[They] talked of a one-way ticket to Siberia and asked me if I had not seen the security cameras or knew that it was Putin’s house,’ Mr Uslu told UPI.com. Fortunately, Mr Uslu was released after one hour in custody, having paid a £830 fine for his ‘crime’. Not impressed: The soldiers who captured Mr Uslu outside Vladimir Putin's villa 'threatened him with a one-way ticket to Siberia' Scene of the crime: Vladimir Putin's well protected luxury villa in Sochi . ‘I don’t really feel like trying to get it back,’ he said.

"The Texas hospital where two nurses were infected treating Ebola-patient Thomas Eric Duncan has apologized for the first time in their mismanaged handling of the outbreak. But it may be too little too late for the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital's nursing staff, who are threatening to stage a walk off after inadequate guidelines left them exposed to the virus for two days. The Dallas hospital's Chief Clinical Officer Dr Daniel Varga admits they 'made mistakes' when Duncan first showed up at the hospital with Ebola symptoms. He was initially sent away with antibiotics, despite telling health care workers that he had recently arrived from Liberia - one of the three countries currently battling the largest outbreak of the disease in history. 'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes. We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,' Dr Varga says in a statement to Congress, released Wednesday. Scroll down for videos . 'We are deeply sorry': Dr Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, has apologized for the first time in their handling of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan (pictured) Regrets: Dr Varga's apology comes in a letter written in Congress. Pictured above in Dallas on Wednesday . A Congressional committee had called Dr Varga to testify on Thursday, but he said he would not be able to make the meeting in person since he is busy dealing with the crisis at his hospital. While Dr Varga apologized for the initial misdiagnosis of Duncan, he says once the patient was brought back to the hospital he was 'treated with the most appropriate and available medical interventions'. When Duncan succumbed to the disease last week, the entire hospital grieved. 'It was devastating to the nurses, doctors, and team who tried so hard to save his life. We keep his family in our thoughts and prayers,' Dr Varga said. Included in the statement, is a section on 'lessons learned and steps taken' in the aftermath of Duncan's death, and the subsequent diagnosis of two nurses. Dr Varga writes that staff are now taking travel history from patients at 'first point of contact' in the emergency room. They are also taking a more 'proactive, intensive' approach to training staff on how to deal with Ebola. 'We are determined to be an agent for change across the US healthcare system by helping our peers benefit from our experience,' Dr Varga wrote. Meanwhile, representatives of the National Nurses Union told CNN they are threatening to stage a walk off after nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, contracted the disease this week. Sickened: Amber Vinson (left) and Nina Pham (right) both cared for Thomas Eric Duncan and both have been diagnosed with Ebola . 'Nurses have the right, if we're going to risk our lives caring for these patients, to have . . . optimal equipment, including Hazmat suits,' Katy Roemer said Wednesday on CNN's Erin Burnett Out Front. It's still unknown how Pham and Vinson became infected with the disease, but they were two of the . Despite suspecting that Duncan, a Liberian national, was sick with the highly contagious disease, hospital staff did not suit up to protect themselves until his diagnosis was confirmed by lab tests, the Dallas Morning News reported. The shocking revelation, culled from Duncan's medical records that were given to the Associated Press, is just the latest report of shortcomings in the protection of hospital workers who were looking after America's Ebola 'patient zero.' Combined, they paint a picture of how two nurses might have become infected with the deadly virus, despite claims that the hospital staff were the 'best in the world' and taking every precaution. Proper protection: These nurses at Bellevue Hospital in New York City demonstrated the garb needed to protect nurses treating Ebola patients during a drill . Exposed: This picture of a nurse at Presbyterian Hospital transporting a Dallas County sheriff's deputy who feared he had Ebola last week, shows that the protective garb exposes the neck below the face mask . On Tuesday, the National Nurses Union revealed that several nurses from Presbyterian Hospital had come to them with reports that, among other things: some supervisors told hospital staff that masks were not necessary when dealing with Duncan, that gloves and face masks left skin partially exposed and that Duncan was not isolated for hours after being taken to the hospital. RoseAnn DeMoro, director of the union, blasted the Centers of Disease Control for seemingly blaming the nurses for their own infections. 'Our nurses are not protected, they're not prepared to handle Ebola or any other pandemics,' she said on Tuesday. 'The protocols that should have been in place in Dallas were not in place and are not in place anywhere in the United States, as far as we can tell.' Hospital investigators are focusing on September 28 - the day Duncan was admitted - to September 30 - the day that Ebola was confirmed - as a likely window for both Ms Pham and Ms Vinson being infected, the Morning News reports. Lapses: The National Nurses Union says nurses at Texas Presbyterian Hospital have reported that protective suits left their necks exposed below the face mask . Gloves were not tapped to protective suits, exposing wrists and hands to exposure from bodily fluids . Shockingly, some supervisors reportedly told nurses that they didn't need protective masks at all . Ms DeMoro and co-director Deborah Burger revealed that nurses from Texas Presbyterian Hospital have reported several grievous lapses in protection for healthcare workers who looked after Duncan. The union, which does not represent any of the nurses at Texas Presbyterian, said the healthcare workers came to them because they believed they had no other way to report the dangerous security lapses. The startling claims include: . Ebola is a virus that spreads by touching the blood, sweat, saliva or other bodily fluids of an infected person. Even a small amount of infected fluid on the skin can cause an infection. All of the Americans who have contracted the disease, including trained healthcare workers who were in Liberia, have said they took meticulous precautions to protect themselves and have no idea how or when they became infected. The nursing union says that Thomas Eric Duncan was left in an open area of a Dallas emergency room for hours, and the nurses treating him worked for days without proper protective gear and faced constantly changing protocols. It says nurses were also forced to use medical tape to secure openings in their flimsy garments, worried that their necks and heads were exposed as they cared for a patient with explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting. They also make the frightening allegation that nurses treating Duncan were also caring for other patients in the hospital at the same time. Burger convened a conference call with reporters to relay what she said were concerns of nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Thomas Eric Duncan - the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. - died last week. RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of Nurses United, said the statement came from 'several' nurses, but she refused repeated inquiries to state how many. She said the organization had vetted the claims, and that the nurses cited were in a position to know what had occurred at the hospital. She refused to elaborate. Nurses say 'the guidelines were constantly changing' at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital - and claims hazardous waste was left to pile to the ceiling in the room that Duncan was being treated. The emergency entrance to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas. Hospital officials have said they are no longer accepting new patients at this time after a healthcare worker, who was caring for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, tested positive for the disease . Speaking at the hastily arranged press conference call on Tuesday, DeMoro and union co-director Deborah Burger alleged an unprofessional and careless approach to Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital. Ultimately, according to DeMoro and Burger, the nurses feel 'unsupported, unprepared, lied to and deserted', especially in light of CDC Director Thomas Frieden's assertion that a 'breach in protocol' led 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham to become infected. 'This nurse was being blamed for not following protocols that did not exist. ... The nurses in that hospital were very angry, and they decided to contact us,' DeMoro said. Texas Health Presbyterian spokesman Wendell Watson denied all of these allegations from the nurses union. 'We have numerous measures in place to provide a safe working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24-7 hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting,' Watson said in a written statement. Pham treated Duncan from the day he was admitted to the hospital, to when he died last Wednesday. She carefully monitored her temperature and went to the hospital on Friday when she noticed a spike. On Tuesday, her condition was upgraded from 'stable' to 'good'.","Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital's Chief Clinical Officer Dr Daniel Varga issued an apology in his statement to Congress, released Wednesday .

"Wendy Davis has reassured her supporters their campaign was not fought in vain as she conceded defeat on stage alongside her mother who almost killed her when she was a child. Davis, who broke down in tears as she gave her concession speech, had earlier called Republican Greg Abbot to congratulate him on his landslide victory. She told supporters at the Davis campaign's Forth Worth election party they must continue fighting despite a landslide victory for her Republican opponent Greg Abbot. Big loss: An emotional Wendy Davis (centre) wipes away her tears after she lost her bid to become governor of Texas. Pictured with her from left is her daughter Dru, mother Ginger Russell, sister Jennifer James, her brother Joey Russell and daughter Amber . She said: 'This wasn't just a campaign for the governor's seat, this was a fight to ensure the state belongs to you,' reported Kera News. 'The only way we will have lost tonight is if we stop fighting. I am so proud of all that we have accomplished.' Davis took to the stage flanked by her daughters and mother. Two months ago the Democrat publicly revealed her mother attempted to kill her and siblings when they were children by putting them in the trunk of her car. The 51-year-old explained her mother was battling depression after her divorce and was struggling as a young single parent with three children under the age of five. Lost in the noise of Tuesday's U.S. Senate elections is a second potential landslide, with Republicans threatening to reassert their dominance over governor's mansions in a large majority of states. The marquee matchup in Texas pitted Greg Abbott, the paraplegic state Attorney General, against state Sen. Wendy Davis, a freshly minted feminist icon known for filibustering an anti-abortion bill in pink sneakers. Abbott had pulled away in recent days, enlarging a 6-point lead to an 18-point spread in the last two weeks – since Davis ran a controversial TV ad making a wheelchair the center of attention - and ended up winning big on Tuesday, despite reports that he failed to even make the ballot in one town. Fond farewell: Davis told her supporters it was OK to be disappointed, but they should never be discouraged . Winner: Texas Attorney General and Republican Governor-elect Greg Abbott (above) waves to the crowd before his victory speech in Austin . Accusations surfaced Tuesday afternoon that in the Lone Star State's third-most populous county, Abbott's name isn't on at least one touch-screen ballot machine. Instead, an Instagram photo of a Bexar County machine shows, the Republican slot is taken by David Dewhurst, the 2012 failed GOP candidate for lieutenant governor. Logan Churchwell, communications director at the conservative True the Vote organization, told MailOnline that his group had confirmed Bexar County has received 'additional complaints' and that 'they are currently investigating how widespread the matter is.' 'Unlike voting machine calibration issues that may switch votes,' he explained, 'this appears to be a data-entry error when preparing the digital ballots.' 'I think it's a photoshopped deal but we are checking,' Bexar County Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen told the San Antonio Express-News. The image, which shows clunky block-like sections of the video template out of place, could reflect a ham-fisted Photoshop attempt, a Republican campaign consultant in Washington told MailOnline. 'Or,' he said, 'it could be that the voting machine's software is messed up. If it's pulling in candidates from two years ago, who knows what else is wrong in those computers?' The campaign operative insisted, though, that Abbott would win Tuesday. Dru Davis (left) comforts her mother Wendy (right) after her loss on Tuesday . Celebration: Abbot embraced his daughter Audrey (above) following his win . An alert Bexar County, Texas voter snapped this picture of a voting machine that omitted the name of GOP gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott, substituting 2012 failed lieutenant governor hopeful David Dewhurst instead . 'Not even the Democratic Party could buy enough votes or stuff enough ballot boxes to save Wendy Davis at this point,' he said. WOAI reporter Jocelyn Tovar posted the Instagram photo after she interviewed the woman who snapped it. It's unclear how that voter could have edited the image so fast, and without leaving the polling place. 'I don't have time for that,' the woman told her. Tovar posted a second photo on Twitter, showing the same kind of digital goof. It's also unclear how many votes for Dewhurst were recorded before the machine was taken out of service. Election officials said there's not much they can do about it, and Texas election law prohibits them from assigning his votes to Abbot. Far less Election Day controversy chased candidates in Maryland, Florida, Wisconsin and other states – 36 in all – that are choosing chief executives on Tuesday. About 14 of those races are rated as toss-ups. In 14 states overall, Democrats appear to be safely in control either because the races are runaways or because they're not contested this year. That number pales next to the 22 states that Republicans can easily count on running when the rust settles. SENDING HIM PACKING? Wisconsin Democrat Mary Burke failed to end the rule of Gov. Scott Walker, even though she got some help from Pres. Obama . Gov. Walker has attracted scorn and tens of millions of dollars in attack ads from angry labor unions, but still could  not be stopped . A second photo of the Bexar County, Texas machine showed a vote cast for Dewhurst, who isn?t running for office this year . Big surrogate: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (front) stumped last week for Maryland Republican gubernatorial hopeful Larry Hogan in a race that's now too close to call . BY A HAIR'S BREADTH? Anthony Brown (right) is Maryland's lieutenant governor, and Michelle Obama wanted him to get the top job . In Wisconsin, organized labor arch-enemy Scott Walker's lead was within the polling margin of error against Democrat Mary Burke, but he still pulled of a rather large victory in the state. Barack Obama has campaigned there for Burke personally, making her one of few politicians who welcomed the unpopular president's help. Walker is loathed on the political left for trimming the sails of the state's powerful unions, but he survived a nasty recall effort and has presided over an economic program that added jobs, cut deficits and grew the state economy dramatically. Maryland ultimately provided the upset of the night as businessman Larry Hogan defeated Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, an African-American whose failure to win the top job could be seen as a repudiation of his boss, Gov. Martin O'Maalley. O'Malley is a likely presidential candidate in 2016, and handing the governor's mansion keys to a Republican will likely hurt his standing immeasurably.","Greg Abbott was a landslide winner in Texas Tuesday evening as liberal darling Wendy Davis fizzled out .

"The mother of the British surgeon found dead in his prison cell in Damascus claims that members of the Syrian government have been taunting her about his death and cruelly stated ‘we gave you a gift… your son’s dead body’. Mrs Fatima Khan said the Syrian regime have been admitting to her privately that they had him killed – but denying it in public. Dr Abbas Khan, from London, had travelled to Syria to help treat casualties from the war but was found dead after being held for over a year. Mrs Khan told MailOnline that when she visited Damascus last year in a bid to find out how he died, a member of the Syrian government issued an astonishing provocation. Fatima Khan (centre), the mother of British doctor Abbas Khan who died at 32 in a Syrian jail in disputed circumstances, is escorted away by United Nations security guards after trying to speak with members of the Syrian regime delegation in Geneva . Fatima Khan, pictured being escorted away by friends after trying to speak with members of the Syrian regime in Geneva, claims that Assad's government has told her 'many times' that her son was put to death . Bouthayna Shabaan, a spokesperson for the regime delegation in the Geneva peace talks and President Bashar Assad’s personal representative, said: ‘Yes, we killed your son. Go back to Britain and tell your British government we killed him.’ She claims that Ms Shabaan has admitted the Syrian regime killed Dr Khan to her personally ‘many times’. A harrowing admission of guilt also allegedly came from Jawdat Ali, who works for the Syrian foreign minister deputy, Faisal Makdad. She claimed that he said Dr Khan was killed 'because his upbringing was wrong’ and then asked: ‘Why teach your son to be a humanitarian aid worker?’ According to Mrs Khan, various reasons have been given for her son's death, with another official during her visit to Damascus saying that he was killed ‘for being a terrorist’. ‘If he was a terrorist I would have killed him myself,’ said a highly emotional Mrs Khan. On Thursday she claims to have had a text message from an immigration officer in Syria that said ‘it was an honour to kill your son’. Dr Khan, an orthopaedic surgeon from Streatham, South London, had travelled to Aleppo to lend his expertise in treating those wounded in the war. However, he was arrested by the Syrians in November 2012, held for 13 months and tortured in a series of notorious prisons. Dr Khan was on the verge of being released when his family were told of his death by what the Syrian government calls suicide and they say was political murder . Family man: Dr Khan with his son Abdullah . The regime agreed to free him, but he was found hanging in his cell only four days before his release. Syrian officials claim the 32-year-old father-of-two hanged himself. But Mrs Khan said: ‘They poisoned his food then hanged him. They’re proud that they killed him. Killing doctors and humanitarian works is so easy for Assad’s regime. They shouldn’t be in power. ‘I don't feel like living anymore.’ David Cameron sent her a letter of condolence and the British government has been broadly supportive, but Mrs Khan isn’t relying on its help to get to the bottom of her son’s death. She has travelled to the Geneva peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition and confronted Assad’s delegates. On Wednesday she had to be led away by security staff after shouting at them. ‘For God's sake, why did you kill my son?,’ Fatima Khan yelled as the team walked out of their hotel. ‘He was a humanitarian worker, he wasn't a fighter. Don't you have a heart?’ Many of the delegates, she said, seem to be very uncomfortable in her presence. She said: ‘They can’t look me in the eye and have been trying to avoid me.’ Regime delegate Luna Shebl has been accused of trying to stop Mrs Khan from speaking to the press . Assad's government claims that Dr Khan's death was suicide - something that his family have rubbished . However, Luna Shebl, a member of the regime delegation, a source at Geneva said, has been deliberately aggravating and obstructing Mrs Khan. Ms Shebl has attempted to stop Mrs Khan speaking to the press, while journalists from Syrian state TV station SANA loyal to her have shouted insults. They apparently taunted her with cries of ‘your son was a killer’. Dr Khan’s family, meanwhile, believe that his body has been flushed with fluids to cover up evidence of anaesthetics in his bloodstream. Although the results of a British post-mortem examination are not yet ready, a CT scan of Dr Khan’s body has apparently shown a cut in the femoral artery in one of his thighs, suggesting fluids were injected into his body. And his family told The Mail on Sunday the Syrian authorities embalmed the 32-year-old’sDr Khan's body against their wishes before returning it to them. Dr Khan’s brother, Dr Shahnawaz Khan, 29, said he fears the embalming was a deliberate attempt by the regime to ruin any future post-mortem examinations as the process involves flushing a dead body with fluids to preserve it.","Fatima Khan said Syrian regime admitted to her they killed her son, Abbas .

"A species of fish that has a killer aim uses physics to hunt for its prey, according to scientists. Archerfish lurk under the surface of water before spitting to hit unsuspecting insects that have landed nearby, which when hit, plummet to their death to provide the fish with food. Research has shown that the animal is able to instinctively take into account light refraction and other physics principles such as the Plateau–Rayleigh instability to be one of the most accurate hunters in the natural world. The GIF above, by Vailati A, Zinnato L, Cerbino R, from the University of Milan, has been slowed down 14 times . The archerfish, a species made up of 7 fish that belong to the genus Toxotes, is able to squirt water at its prey with incredible speed and accuracy. It takes just on tenth of a second after the fish has squirted its prey to anticipate the spot an insect will fall so it is ready to gobble it down. Cleverer still is the fish’s aim, as the tiny creature takes into account the way light bends as it enters water. The archerfish is able to correct its aim to anticipate an insect’s true position, rather than the perceived one from underwater, Wired reported. Amazingly the animal also accounts for how gravity bends the jet of water’s path, as spit does not travel in a straight line, but is pulled down by Earth’s gravity. When taking aim, the archerfish takes refraction into account - the way light bends as it enters water. The archerfish is able to correct its aim to anticipate an insect's true position, rather than the perceived one from underwater . For example, if an insect is 10 centimetres above the surface of the water, the archerfish factors in a ‘spit fall’ of between zero and two centimetres, while is the insect is higher above the water at 30 centimetres, the ‘spit fall’ ranges from two to 15 centimetres. While the fish might not be aware it is solving physics problems, it is able to adjust the angle and speed of its spit to accurately catch its dinner. Strangely, the spit actually accelerates when it climbs higher, which is the opposite to what happens when a ball or bullet is fired upwards, as a combination of gravity and air resistance usually slow moving bodies down, Alberto Vailati, a professor of fluid dynamics at the University of Milan, told Wired writer and physicist, Aatish Bhatia. A group of scientists from the university looked at different trajectories of spit squirted by archerfish and discovered the spit consistently hits its insect target at a faster speed than it left the animal, according to their research, which was published in the journal PLOS One. They believe the fish manages this by spitting in a special way, to ensure that the tail end of the jet of water is moving faster than the start of the stream. The archerfish also accounts for . how gravity bends the jet of water’s path, as spit does not travel in a . straight line, but is pulled down by Earth’s gravity. It therefore aims . higher than the object it wants to hit. Strangely, its spit also . accelerates as it nears its target so the fish can hit an insect with . amplified force . This effectively squeezes the jet into a smaller space and the front end of the jet widens slightly, which physicists recognise as the Plateau–Rayleigh instability. The theory says that any stream of water has irregularities in thickness and surface tension – the tendency of water molecules to attract each other – which exaggerates the irregularities so that the stream breaks into droplets. The archerfish uses the way water 'bunches' and forms into droplets in tandem to make a powerful jet of spit. The creature ensures that the water jet does not break up into droplets by ensuring the water at the back of the stream is moving faster than the front so that when fast ‘lumps’ touch slower ones in front, they join together to make a large accelerating blob that strikes the insect with amplified force. By using this technique, the fish concentrates the energy of the stream into the front ‘blob’ to hit the insect harder than if it hunted at point-blank range. In fact, the physicists believe the technique means the animal has a striking power that is five times more than what a vertebrate muscle can generate. The fish spits in a special way to ensure that the tail end of the jet of water is moving faster than the start of the stream. This effectively squeezes the jet into a smaller space and the front end of the jet widens slightly. Physicists recognise this as the Plateau-Rayleigh instability . Archerfish are a family of fish known for their ability to hunt land-based insects and small animals by shooting them down with jets of water. The family consists of seven species in the genus Toxotes. They typically lives in waters of estuaries and mangroves but can also be found in open ocean and upstream in fresh water. The species can be found from India to the Philippines, Polynesia and Australia.They have a lower jaw that juts out and typically measure five to 10 cm long. Adult fish almost always hit their insect target on their first attempt. They can bring down insects on perches three metres above the water's surface. They have good eyesight and the ability to compensate for the refraction of light as it passes through the air-water interface when aiming for their prey. Archerfish typically spit at prey at a mean angle of about 74° from the horizontal, but can still aim accurately when spitting at angles between 45 and 110°. When an archerfish selects its prey, it rotates its eye so that the image of the prey falls on a particular portion of the eye and its lips just break the surface, squirting a jet of water at its victim. It does this using the narrow groove in the roof of its mouth. The creature presses its tongue against this groove to form a narrow channel, then contracts its gill covers to force a powerful jet of water through the channel. The resulting jet of water can be up to five metres long. The fish can alter the power of the shot for prey of different sizes.","Physicists from the University of Milan looked at the different trajectories of spit .

"A 23-year-old man died of an apparent drug overdose on Wednesday after being found unconscious in the apartment bathtub of prominent New York hotel tycoon Ian Reisner. Mr Reisner, 46, called 911 around 8.21am to report that a man needed medical attention at his apartment at 230 Central Park South in Manhattan. Paramedics rushed Sean Verdi of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to St Luke's Hospital where he was  pronounced dead at 9.03am. Sean Verdi, 23, (pictured right) died on Wednesday morning after being found unconscious in the New York apartment of prominent hotel mogul Ian Reisner, 46 (pictured left) Sean Verdi's parents said that their son met Ian Reisner at a club. Above, the Central Park South building where the 23-year-old was found unconscious on Wednesday morning in an apparent drug overdose . A police source told the New York Daily News that Verdi's death appeared to be a drug overdose while friends claimed to the News that the young man had taken cocaine and molly. The medical examiner will give an official ruling after conducting an autopsy on Thursday. Investigators also do not believe any criminality was involved. MailOnline was awaiting a response from the NYPD today. Mr Verdi's parents told the New York Post that their son met Mr Reisner at Bartini Ultra Lounge in the Hell's Kitchen district of Manhattan, where the 23-year-old worked, before he and a few other people went back to the property developer's luxury pad. His stepfather Steven Colandrea told the Post that Sean never had any problems and they were upset to find out how old Mr Reisner is. MailOnline had reached out to Mr Reisner for comment on Thursday. Last May, the 23-year-old graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey with a degree in bioengineering this summer and belonged to the Sigma Nu fraternity. The medical examiner will give an official ruling on the cause of death for Mr Verdi (pictured) after conducting an autopsy on Thursday . Mr Reisner, pictured with drag queen Sherry Vine in 2012, is one of New York City's prominent real estate developers and owns the gay hotel OUT NYC in Hell's Kitchen . Verdi's social media revealed his love of being part of a college fraternity and a number of references to partying in New York, Vermont and Florida. Reisner is the co-founder of Parkview Developers, which builds hotels and apartment buildings throughout Manhattan. He started the company in 2003 with business partner Mati Weiderpass. Together they started the gay hotel OUT NYC in Hell's Kitchen. He previously worked on Wall Street for 15 years with Salomon Brothers and then Bank of America. According to real estate blog, The Real Deal,  Reisner lives in a 4,000-sq-ft apartment which was created by combining five apartments in Southmoor House at 230 Central Park South. The duplex spreads over the 16th and 17th floors and has views of Central Park. The apartment has four bedrooms, six bathrooms and space to throw parties for 100 people. Reisner and Mr Weiderpass once turned down an offer of $15.5million in cash for the luxury home. 'Give me an excuse and I’ll throw a party,' Reisner said in the 2009 interview. Reisner was arrested on a drug-related charge earlier this year close to his family's home in Water Mill in the Hamptons. He was arrested in East Hampton in May after allegedly fleeing the scene of an accident while under the influence of drugs, the East Hampton Star reported. Local authorities charged him with misdemeanor DWI and he was released on $500 bail. Reisner (pictured left) started Parkview Developers in 2003 with business partner Mati Weiderpass (right).

"An investigation has been launched into a female officer who was assaulted when she returned from a holiday with a policeman it is alleged she had an affair with. West Midlands Police today confirmed they would be looking into the alleged affair involving PCs Mark Davis and WPC Elaine Turner but did not go into any more details. It was revealed that Mr Davis went to Turkey telling the mother of his three children that he was going on a week-long stag do. However his partner turned detective and caught him and his WPC lover when they returned home from a romantic getaway. Fellow passengers witnessed Helen McEvoy and her sister Donna asking Mr Davis if he had enjoyed the break ‘with your bit on the side’ as they ambushed him and Miss Turner at the airport. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oblivious: Mark Davis and his lover Elaine come into arrivals not knowing that they are about to be caught out by his partner Helen and her sister Donna . Scandal: PC Mark Davis with his partner of 12 years Helen McEvoy and one of their children before his affair with a fellow officer was revealed . The quartet then became involved in a fracas that sent a display of chocolate bars  flying before police intervened. The whole incident was captured on CCTV. The McEvoy sisters, who were arrested and charged with assault, received 12-month conditional discharges after magistrates accepted that Mr Davis’s partner had suffered a ‘great degree of provocation’. Outlining the ‘sad and sordid background’ to the case, Philip Haycock, defending, said Mr Davis, 29, had sent McEvoy, also 29, a flurry of loving texts saying how much he was missing her during the ‘stag week’, supposedly for a colleague. However, when a suspicious McEvoy looked up the ‘groom’ in question, she found he was still at home in Dudley, West Midlands. McEvoy then called Mr Davis, at which . point he changed his story and claimed to be ‘on his own, trying to get . his head together’. Solihull magistrates court heard that he told McEvoy he would be flying in to Gatwick, where he arranged to meet her. She . did not believe him, and instead went to Birmingham Airport on the day . he was due back. She and her sister were waiting at 1am as Mr Davis, . still wearing his holiday shorts and T-shirt, emerged with two suitcases . – and 35-year-old Miss Turner in tow.

Helen wanted to show Elaine that Mr Davis had been . playing both of them and that they were still in a relationship. ‘She tried to show the text messages, but the situation deteriorated very quickly.’ The . court heard Mr Davis had already been forgiven once before for cheating . on McEvoy with Miss Turner, a colleague of his at West Bromwich police . station. He had dismissed the incident as a one-night stand. Mr . Haycock added that his client McEvoy, a benefits adviser at Dudley . Council, believed Miss Turner had tried to make trouble for her at work . by sending a letter to her boss on police-headed paper accusing her of . harassment. ‘I would . have thought that if this was the case a complaint would have been made . to police,’ he said, adding that he was ‘concerned’ at the serving . officer’s use of official paper for the letter.

Assault: Shelves of sweets and chocolates were thrown about when the row got out of hand . VIDEO: Woman scorned? Girlfriend confronts boyfriend and secret lover... West Midlands Police’s professional standards department is investigating the matter. ‘I would have thought that anybody caught having an affair would have taken it  on the chin and would not pour salt on the wounds by pursuing a prosecution,’ Mr Haycock added. He stressed that the McEvoy sisters both accepted their behaviour was ‘not entirely appropriate’, but described his client as ‘the victim in this case even though she appears as the defendant’. McEvoy, from Dudley, admitted assaulting Miss Turner. Her older sister Donna, also of Dudley, admitted assaulting both Mr Davis and Miss Turner. Shocked: Mark Davis stands after the attack speaking to a WH Smith worker afterwards . Sentencing, magistrate Michael Martin said: ‘It’s obvious a deplorable series of events led to this incident. ‘We believe both sisters attended to determine if [Mr Davis] had been telling the truth, and not for a violent confrontation. There is a considerable amount of mitigation in this case.’ Yesterday McEvoy was not answering the door of the semi-detached property she shared with Mr Davis. Her mother told the Daily Mail that she was no longer in a relationship with the policeman, but declined to comment further. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said Mr Davis and Miss Turner would not face sanctions over their relationship, but added: ‘We can confirm an investigation is ongoing involving a female police officer.’ A spokesman for West Midlands Police refused to give details about the nature of the investigation into PC Turner, but added: 'We can confirm that an investigation is currently ongoing involving a female police officer.'

So I lost my passport, and I was grounded and I never made another trip like that,' Kerry said. As he looks back on that day in 1954, Kerry said: 'I never forgot and now it's vanished. Now, so many other countries have followed with this spirit of giving life to people's individual hopes and aspirations.' Kerry's trip to Berlin, his first as secretary of state, is part of a nine-country dash through Europe and the Middle East. He is using the visit as an opportunity to praise religious and political tolerance in the U.S. and encourage other countries to seek the same freedoms. 'In America, you have a right to be . stupid, if you want to be,' he said. 'And you have a right to be . disconnected to somebody else if you want to be. And we tolerate that - . we somehow make it through that. Left: Kerry is pictured at the age of 6, boating in Massachusetts. Right: Kerry's father, Richard Kerry was an American diplomat.

Tolerance is 'something worth fighting for,' he explained.

In an aside, Kerry also took the opportunity to heap praise on the preppy New England clothing line Vineyard Vines, which is popular on Capitol Hill and in upscale communities across the Northeast, after someone complimented him on his pink tie. After praising the company, he told the crowd where they could buy the tie online and said to laughter, 'I don't own any stock in the company.'

"Happy New Year from St Barths! The beautiful little island paradise in the French West Indies is just 50 minutes by propeller plane from Antigua (but more of that later). You'll have to forgive the late blog entry this week as high levels of partying and industrial strength hangovers have taken their toll. NYE was a big one that lasted well into Jan 1 - a beach party with the world's biggest DJ David Guetta. The flight into St Barths is not for the faint-hearted and so the luxury of private jet does help, says Spencer . My good friend Max and I had VIP tickets to the Nikki Beach party, which was mind-blowing. Right from the start we knew it was going to be one of those memorable nights that we'll talk about for years to come. We started with a few Chili-Chili Bang Bang cocktails (jalapeno-infused tequila gives this drink a bit of a kick) at the On The Rocks bar at my parent's hotel the Eden Rock, before moving over to Nikki beach by about 11pm so that we could have a good spot when midnight came in. Nikki beach is next door to our hotel on St Jean's Bay so it's literally two minutes walk away across the sand. The party was heaving with the great and the good, and it was a very beautiful crowd. We had a table right next to the DJ – you can see how close we were from the picture. And if you felt like a bit of time out, you could just walk down to the sea and have a paddle. It was an amazing night that went on to a friend's poolside party at the villa up in the hills just above. The next day was spent recovering at the Sand Bar at the Eden Rock hotel. You can see the pictures we took – they're not the best shots ever but it was the best we could do in our state of health. Spencer had a table right next to the DJ - David Guetta - you can see how close they were from this picture . Spencer and his good friend Max had VIP tickets to the Nikki Beach party, which was 'mind-blowing' If you felt like a bit of time-out from the party, you could just walk down to the sea and have a paddle . I flew out to St Barth's just after Christmas with my family up at our house in Scotland, and I was lucky to get a lift on a friend's private plane on the last leg of the journey. Doing the flight in on a propeller plane . can be a bit of a white-knuckle ride for some as incoming flights drop . steeply over the top of a mountain and onto the runway. It's not for the faint-hearted, so the luxury of private jet does help to calm the nerves. I've done it so many times now that it doesn't bother me, but it can seriously freak out nervous flyers. It's a lot easier on the return journey as you take off straight over the sea, the only problem with the away leg is that you are leaving this amazing place. The worst part of the return flight, Spencer says, is that you're leaving this incredible place . And now, sadly, it's time to pack and go back to work in storm swept Britain… but that said, I'm looking forward to new challenges in 2014. 1. Not to go back to yo-yo dieting. I've been a good boy so far and I'm still in good shape. I've kept up my fitness and thanks to the odd Forza T5 Super Strength pill here and there I've kept the snacking at bay. I want to look my best for the next series of Made In Chelsea. We start filming in a couple of weeks and it will be great to hook up with everyone again after a long break. 2.

"Downton fans were sent into a frenzy of anticipation this week, as more details about the new series were released. The forth run of the drama -  sold to over 220 territories around the world and believed to have been seen by approximately 120 million people - will begin next month. And the millions seduced by the strait-laced but stylish world of the British historical drama will soon be able to take some of that style home. If you want lips as soft as Lady Mary's, wine inspired by Lord Grantham's favorite tipple - or even walls the exact shade of grey as as Mrs. Patmore's kitchen, you're in luck as there is a new wave of merchandise set to hit stores. There will be a board game, homewares, clothes, beauty products, and even Downton wine hitting stores this year . The programme's makers have arguably been slow to exploit the commercial potential of the show's popularity through merchandising, selling little more than DVD sets, wall calendars and desk diaries. But that is all about to change. A huge range of merchandise is being rolled out to accompany the fourth season, including a board game, homewares, clothes, beauty products, and even Downton wine - all in the best possible taste, naturally. 'We haven't rushed into it,' executive producer Gareth Neame told The Associated Press this week. 'We don't want to carpet bomb the retail sector.' On October 12, British retail chain Marks & Spencer will launch its Downton Abbey beauty line in 250 stores and online. The range includes soap, nail polish, lip gloss, lotion and scented candles. The items are whimsically packaged and inscribed with quotations from the series, including the advice offered by Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess of Grantham in the first episode: 'No one wants to kiss a girl in black.' Want lips as soft as Lady Mary's? Marks and Spencer are unveiling a Downton Abbey make-up range which includes lip gloss and balm . Downton merchandising in the U.S. and Canada is handled by Knockout Licensing, which has struck deals for a jewellery range from Danbury Mint and Downton-themed Christmas ornaments from Kurt Adler - both going on sale later this year. It also has a licensing agreement with figurine manufacturer Bradford Exchange, raising fans' hopes for a range of Downton dolls - Scheming Thomas and Admirable Bates, perhaps. North American fans also can soon drink Downton Abbey wine, marketed by Wines That Rock, the California company behind Rolling Stones' 40 Licks Merlot and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon Cabernet Sauvignon. The Downton red is a French claret reminiscent of those favored by the early 20th-century British aristocracy. Cele Otnes, a professor of marketing at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says the richly detailed world of Downton Abbey is key to viewers' intense bond with the show . She likens it to Mad Men saying: 'It's not just a television program, it's really an aesthetic' - and cites reported rises in sales of cravats, waistcoats and sherry as evidence of a Downton-driven appetite for Edwardian elegance. 'It's that whole thing about presenting a lifestyle,' she said. 'We get in the house, we get inside these characters' lives. We see inside their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their kitchens. We can absorb ourselves not only in the story, which is compelling, but in the details of their lives.' No detail is too small to be cashed in on - down to the paint on the abbey walls. Mylands, the London-based paint company that supplies the show with historically accurate pigments, recently began marketing two of its Downton tones to the public - Amber Grey, the color of the downstairs kitchen overseen by cook Mrs. Patmore, and Empire Grey, which adorns Mr. Carson's butler's pantry. These are not just any greys. They are Downton greys. 'On the sets they look quite dark because they use them below stairs,' said Mylands spokeswoman Simone Barker. But in real life, 'they do look extremely chic.' Otnes hopes the products manage to remain tasteful rather than tacky. As a fan, she urges producers to 'take a page from Lord and Lady Grantham's pool of reserve"" and limit the range of merchandise, . 'I hope they don't over-market the show,' she said. Marks & Spencer is launching a Downton Abbey beauty line, including soap, nail polish, lip gloss, lotion and scented candles, on October 12. The Downton Abbey Fragranced Candle (£8.50) and the three-shade Lip Gloss collection (£9.50) The items are whimsically packaged and adorned with quotations from the series- Downton Abbey Lip Balm Duo (£5) Neame - who heads Downton production company Carnival Films, owned by NBC Universal - isn't worried. 'I don't have a nervous attitude about the idea of merchandising,' said Neame, who personally approves every item of merchandise. 'When a show is this global and this loved, I don't see any problem with offering products to hardened fans who want to extend their relationship with the show that they love. 'We are businesspeople. We are running a business, which is to create intellectual property and to monetise it. 'We sell as many DVDs as we can, and we sell the show in as many countries as we can, and you know what, by doing that we get the money on the screen and it allows me to finance other shows that we want to make and employ people. So I'm not coy about the merchandising and its purpose.' The hit ITV series has . inspired a French claret that producers say the cast would . be proud of .","A host of new products announced .

"The glamorous new lady of Longleat House has told of her regret that her father-in-law the Marquess of Bath chose to boycott her wedding two months ago. Emma McQuiston, daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon, became Britain’s first black viscountess when she wed Lord Bath’s son and heir Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth. But the eccentric Lord Bath, nicknamed the Loins of Longleat for his string of ‘wifelets’, stayed away from the nuptials after a furious  dispute over the moving of some of his famous erotic murals from the couple’s apartment within the stately home. Regret: Emma McQuiston, has spoken of her regret that her father-in-law did not attend her wedding . ‘It’s very sad he didn’t come to the . wedding and that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but . what can I do?’ Emma says in an exclusive interview with The Mail on .

"A cavalryman survivor of the Hyde Park nail bombing killed his two young children and then himself after his wife demanded a divorce, an inquest heard. Michael Pedersen, 51, saw four fellow soldiers and seven horses from the Blues and Royals killed in the infamous IRA terrorist attack in 1982. His horse at the time, Sefton, became a household name at the time because of its amazing recovery. But after struggling to cope with the the end of his 10-year marriage to wife Erica, Mr Pedersen killed their two children, Ben, seven, and Freya, six, and then killed himself. Tragic: Ben and Freya Pedersen, here pictured with their mother Erica, were killed by their father Michael, a soldier who survived an IRA bomb attack . Controlling: Michael Pedersen, left, pictured with his son Ben, who he stabbed along with six-year-old Freya . Mr Pedersen, had been described as ‘controlling’ and suspicious of his wife, who he had previously accused of having an affair, the inquest heard. He had recently complained to his doctor that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after his 21-year army career. The couple’s marriage had collapsed after an argument at a party where Mrs Pedersen claimed her husband had assaulted her. Mr Pedersen was arrested and served an injunction banning him from visiting the family home in Ashford, Middlesex. Killed: Michael Pedersen told his doctor that he had been suffering from PTSD after his time in the army . Giving evidence, Mrs Pedersen said she had suffered a broken arm and shoulder after her husband pushed her and she had fallen at the military reunion on August 25. ‘He decided to tell me I was an unfit mother. He shoved me in the back and I went flying,’ she told the inquest at Winchester. Mrs Pedersen, a 43-year-old driving instructor, said that by the summer their marriage was ‘not good at all’ and had started divorce proceedings at the time of the deaths. She said: ‘There was constant shouting, accusing me of things. He was constantly shouting but there were quite a few quite nasty outbursts,’ she added. Mr Pedersen, a lorry driver, was given a caution by police in 2004 for assaulting a man he suspected of having an affair with his wife, the inquest was told. Mrs Pedersen told the hearing that before Mr Pedersen left he ransacked the family home and took her chef’s knife - which was later used in the brutal killings. On the day of the deaths Mr Pedersen had taken the children on a pre-arranged visit to see his father Brian and the family enjoyed a trip to a lake before lunch together. Brian Pedersen said that his son had been affected by the breakdown of his marriage more than his experiences with the Army. ‘I think the thing that hurt him more than anything else was when he was told to leave his house and children and to leave Erica, who he loved in his own way. ‘I don’t think he could bear to live without all those things and for anyone to say that it was what happened in the Army that affected his judgement - that’s wrong.‘ he said. In a Facebook message a few weeks before the tragedy, Mr Pedersen wrote that he had experienced the 'worst day of my life' after splitting from his wife . Cryptic: Messages on Facebook revealed Mr Pederson's distressed state of mind . Later that day Mr Pedersen took the children to a remote country lane in Hampshire where he parked the car and brutally attacked them. The bodies were found by a dog walker, who saw Mr Pedersen’s Saab Convertible and then noticed a child’s leg at Newton Stacey, near Andover, on September 30. Ben was found with six stab wounds and a kitchen knife sticking ‘bolt upright’ in his chest. His younger sister, dressed in a pink top and patterned pink leggings, had been attacked with a larger knife, which her father then turned on himself. Both children died from stab wounds to the chest and suffered defensive wounds to their arms and hands. Mr Pedersen had stabbed himself in the chest, piercing his heart. No traces of alcohol, anti-depressants or other drugs were found in his system. Rehabilitation: Michael Pedersen of the Household Cavalry during his recovery after the IRA bomb .

Bomb survivors: Michael Pederson gets a 'kiss' from Sefton, who he was riding during the 1982 IRA bomb attack on the Queen's Cavalry at Hyde Park in London . A number of letters addressed to various people, including Mrs Pedersen and the police were discovered inside the vehicle. Mr Pedersen’s younger brother Robert told the inquest that he had been upset with his wife. But he was also ‘angry’ with police whom he felt had not listened to him after he was questioned on suspicion of assault. Speaking of Ben and Freya, Robert added: ‘He worshipped the ground they walked on’. A navy Saab is taken away from the scene in Newton Stacey, near Andover, Hampshire . A police officer guards the closed-off bridleway in Newton Stacey, near . Andover, Hampshire, where the bodies were found by a member of the . public . Several witnesses described Mr . Pedersen, who had two children from a previous marriage, as controlling and sometimes overbearing and a bully. Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short recorded that Freya and Ben had been unlawfully killed by their father. He ruled that Pedersen, who had recently moved to Chertsey, Surrey, committed suicide. ‘It seems to me this was a . pre-conceived decision because of the location chosen. It was on a . remote spot in the country where you might assume you were unlikely to . be seen or discovered,’ he said. ‘What happened is beyond . comprehension. It must have been terrifying for Ben and Freya in . particular to have realised what their father intended and then to be . attacked in the way they clearly were.’ Vicious attack: The IRA's car-mounted nail bomb detonated on South Carriage Drive as soldiers rode to the Changing of the Guard at 10.40am.

"He may not yet be able to talk, but Prince George’s body language spoke volumes at his first royal ‘meet and greet’: and every movement revealed a baby destined to be King. As an expert on body language – I’ve written 26 books on the subject – I’ve been following the royal family for over 30 years and I have been riveted by these images of George. Clearly a calm, extremely sociable and very self-confident baby, he’s not just happy to be the centre of attention - he absolutely revels in it. Scroll down for video . He may not yet be able to talk, but Prince George's body language spoke volumes at his first royal 'meet and greet' It’s such a contrast to the images 31 years ago of the William’s first tour of Australia. Although he was a month older than his son is now, his body language betrayed an underlying shyness and anxiety. He never wanted to stray far from his parents and kept checking back with them. While obviously an incredibly sweet little boy, there was an air of vulnerability and nervousness about him that you can still, at times, detect in him now. Although George is so tiny, he is already showing a very powerful personality, ready smile and very mature body language for a baby. His first duty, after the ravages of a 30 hour flight was to play nicely with a group of children he had never met before at a playgroup. George revealed himself to be a calm, extremely sociable and very self-confident baby . It would be a tall order for any baby, let alone one who - you might suppose - does not get many opportunities to mingle. None of us would have been surprised if George had bawled his eyes out or, at the very least, buried his head shyly in his mum’s neck. And who would blame Kate and William if they had looked riven with trepidation? Instead, George took everything in his stride. Unlike most of the other children, who stayed rooted on the spot, fixated on the carpet or snuggled against their parents, George never gave his a backward glance as he threw himself into his new social whirl, proving delightfully curious and eager to engage. And his relaxed, smiling parents were clearly expecting nothing less. It’s obvious from their open stance and beaming smiles that they knew he would be absolutely fine. Why? Because they have made him so – purely by being so happy and relaxed themselves . George The Bold . Despite the fact he’s among complete strangers, George is already holding court. Sitting right in the middle of the group with his feet pointing together and knees out like this implies a high degree of self-confidence and not the slightest flicker of social anxiety. George the bold - he's happy as the centre of attention, particularly making sure he's at centre of Kate's . Curious George . This is an Alpha baby in motion. George has recognised the biggest toy in the room and is going straight for it. His very intense gaze, jutting lower lip and firmly set jaw are unexpected in such a young baby - signalling real focus and determination. With his eyes on the prize, he’s not concerned with checking back with his parents: he’s off on his own, propelling himself purposefully across the floor. Curious George - he's honed in on the toy he wants and no one's going to stand in his way . Hands-on George . Said toy secured, George is now showing it off as a trophy to the other babies. Tellingly though, he’s not grabbing it protectively - nor is he crowing - he’s just eager to engage his new friends’ attention, so they can appreciate his achievement. This is a little chap who’s going to grow up knowing exactly how to get his own way, in the most charming way possible. Hands-on George - he's got his hands on the prize and is trying to get a little girl's attention, to make sure everyone knows it . Jigging George . This is such a genuinely joyful pose. Kate’s smiling, relaxed expression shows that she has absolutely no fears that George is about to get upset. She knows her boy well enough to know he will take being the centre of attention all in his stride. Bouncing baby ¿ standing and bouncing, strong and advanced for his age . Perfect Pouter . That bottom lip may be out again, but it’s George’s confident gaze and the relaxed way he’s sitting in his mother’s arms that are really telling here. Remember the way Diana habitually carried William protectively on her hip? Kate is relaxed enough to hold George in front of her - almost like she’s offering him a seat, allowing him to face the world. Perfect pouter - jutting bottom lip suggests he's going to be good at getting what he wants . Mama’s Boy . Babies love to play with their mum’s hair, and George’s gesture shows they have a playful, tactile relationship. It’s also very interesting to see that Kate holds George at eye level, yet still allows a gap between their bodies. This is a gesture of equals – Diana was a great hugger, but the less confident William would have buried his face in his mum’s neck at this point. Mama's boy - even at 8 months, he's already got an eye for Kate's mane attraction . Gorgeous George . You can’t tell who is enjoying this cuddle more. Although George is clearly content in his mother’s arms, he still has his eyes on the room, as though he is sizing up with toy he might play with next. It’s also clear that this wasn’t an emergency cuddle to soothe him: just an expression of love. Gorgeous George - going in for a cuddle, although he's not overly clingy with Kate . Fearless George . George . is after another child’s toy - typical of a budding Alpha male. At this . moment many mothers would have worried their child would do something . hideous, like whack the other child on the head with it. But Kate looks . unfazed.

"Concern: William Hague warned that Israel's plans to build 3,000 more settlements would cast doubt on their commitment to peace with the Palestinians . The Foreign Secretary William Hague today urged Israel to abandon plans to build 3,000 more settlement homes in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, warning that going ahead with the move would cast doubt on Israel's commitment to achieving peace with the Palestinians. The proposals to build the thousands of new homes were revealed yesterday, one day after the UN voted to recognise a Palestinian state. Mr Hague warned that going ahead with the plans would make a two-state solution 'difficult to achieve'. The Foreign Secretary said he was 'extremely concerned' at the plans and warned that they undermined Israel's international reputation. Mr Hague abstained at the UN General Assembly vote over Palestine's status on Thursday after President Mahmoud Abbas failed to give assurances that he would return to peace negotiations without preconditions. But Mr Hague also repeatedly made clear in calls with Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman that the UK would not support a strong reaction to the vote. Speaking today, the Foreign Secretary said: 'I am extremely concerned by reports that the Israeli cabinet plans to approve the building of 3,000 new housing units in illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. 'Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and undermine trust between the parties. If implemented, these plans would alter the situation on the ground on a scale that makes the two-state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital, increasingly difficult to achieve. Since celebration: Palestinians celebrate as the UN General Assembly agrees to recognise a Palestinian state as Israel reveals plans to build 3,000 settlement homes in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank . 'They would undermine Israel's . international reputation and create doubts about its stated commitment . to achieving peace with the Palestinians. 'The . UK strongly advises the Israeli government to reverse this decision. The window for a two-state solution is closing, and we need urgent . efforts by the parties and by the international community to achieve a . return to negotiations, not actions which will make that harder.' The Palestinians have refused to negotiate while Israeli settlement construction continues. On . Thursday the UN General Assembly agreed to recognise Palestine as a . non-member observer state allowing the country to take part in UN . debates and potentially join bodies such as the International Criminal . Court. The Palestinians are firmly opposed to the construction and say that the development will cut the West Bank in half, preventing the formation of a joining Palestinian state. Some of the units have been reported to be built between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, according to the Israeli Haaretz newspaper. Constructing communities: Israel revealed plans to build 3,000 more settlement homes and accelerating the planning process for another 1,000 (pictured is a construction site in the West Bank Jewish settlement in 2011) Opposed: The Palestinians are set against the construction, arguing that it will cut the West Bank in half, preventing the formation of a joining Palestinian state (stock picture in East Jerusalem in 2011) Jubilant: Members of the Palestinian delegation and others join Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas by applauding during a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly after the vote . Israel is also said to be accelerating the processing of planning permission for another 1,000 such housing units. Worthless: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the vote is meaningless . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin . Netanyahu called the speech by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to . the General Assembly shortly before the vote ‘defamatory and venomous,’ saying it was ‘full of mendacious propaganda’ against Israel. Netanyahu called the vote meaningless. Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, said earlier today that the UN vote was a ‘negative political theatre’ that would ‘hurt peace’. But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said this was the 'last chance to save the two-state solution' with Israel. Since the occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, some 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements. The communities are considered illegal under international law but Israel challenges this. Israel still controls the West Bank, east Jerusalem and access to Gaza, and it accused the Palestinians of bypassing negotiations with the campaign to upgrade their U.N. status. Peace talks have been conducted between Israel and the Palestinian Authority intermittently over the last 20 years but with no permanent solution. The most recent peace talks halted in January after several months of ‘proximity talks’ made no progress.

"A new study has found that men are more likely to boast about their accomplishments (illustrated with a stock image) Men are more likely to boast about their accomplishments, according to research that will come as no surprise to many women. They are also more likely to lie to cover up their deficiencies, a new study has found. Approximately seven in 10 men confessed to boasting about what they are good at, while half admitted they have claimed to be skilled in areas that they are not. The survey suggests that men’s reliance on bragging comes from a greater need to boost their own confidence and one in 10 men said they do it in a bid to win the respect of others. Psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, of Lancaster University, said men are conditioned to be more competitive than women and feel a greater need to impress. ‘The reason for men being more boastful than women stems from traditional male and female roles,’ he said. ‘In the past, men were more likely to be the main breadwinners, with a need to boast to achieve success within the competitive male dominated workplace. ‘Outside the workplace, boasting may be used by men for impressing members of the opposite sex.’ Almost half of men surveyed by thetrainline.com confessed to bragging in order to boost their confidence and 42 per cent said they have lied about their abilities to make themselves look good. Out to impress: One psychologist thinks that men are more boastful because of traditional male and female roles. In the past, when men tended to be the breadwinners, they has to boast to achieve success within the workplace and to impress the opposite sex (illustrated) Britons claim to be best at: . Britons are worst at: . In contrast, the survey found that just 37 per cent of women have misled others about their talents, while 54 per cent said they have blown their own trumpet. The study found that people are more likely to show off when they are younger. Over half of 18-24 year-olds exaggerate their skills, compared to a quarter of over 55's. The research found that men in particular struggle to admit to things they are bad at, but recognising failings is an endearing quality to others, experts said. When others confess their weaknesses, 67 per cent of people appreciate their honesty, 41 per cent have more respect for them and 15 per cent like them more. Females are more modest: The survey found that just 37 per cent of women have misled others about their talents, while 54 per cent said they have blown their own trumpet and boasted about an accomplishment (illustrated) Confirming that a great British stereotype is true – that Britons are humble and depreciating, – most people believe themselves to be rubbish at eight things and only good at five. It appears that Britons' main shortcomings as a nation are singing and dancing, with other half of respondents to the story admitting they have no talent in these areas. Around two in five people say they are good at saving money and 22 per cent at planning efficient travel routes. However, it might be fair to assume that women are better at planning day trips, as men are 27 per cent more likely to miss a train than women and 19 per cent more inclined to jump on the wrong one. They are also more likely to lose luggage and tickets. Running late: Around 20 per cent of Britons said they are best at making travel arrangements, but men were found to be 27 per cent more likely to miss a train than women (illustrated) and 19 per cent more inclined to jump on the wrong one .","New study revealed 70 per cent of British men have boasted about a talent and half have claimed to be skilled in areas that they are not .

"Uruguay may believe Luis Suarez will be fit for their first World Cup game but a three-week turnaround is pushing it for a meniscus injury. The meniscus is a piece of cartilage in the knee that acts as a cushion between the thigh and shin bones. From the sound of it, Suarez has a minor tear. Normally there are two options to heal this: remove the damaged cartilage or try to repair it. Cutting out a section is a quicker procedure than repairing it, which can take several months. Suarez is likely to have had only some cartilage removed. It can take up to six weeks for a player to recover. Once the . swelling has gone down he will work in the pool and use an Alter-G . treadmill to recover the knee movement without putting a lot of weight . on it.

"The Faroe Islands were colonised earlier than believed and it wasn't by the Vikings, a study said. 'Vikings' are pictured at a Shetland festival . The Faroe Islands were colonised much earlier than previously believed, and it wasn’t by the Vikings, a study has found. New archaeological evidence places human colonisation in the 4th to 6th centuries AD, at least 300 to 500 years earlier than when the Norse colonists arrived on the remote islands. Historians have said that the identity of the first settlers remains unknown, but they could have been hermit monks from Scotland or Ireland. The research challenges the nature, scale and timing of human settlement of the wider North Atlantic region and has implications for the colonisation of similar island groups across the world. It has long been thought that Vikings were the first settlers in the 9th Century on the windy islands, which are situated between the North Atlantic Ocean and Norwegian Sea. Archaeologists at Durham University studied a site at Á Sondum on the island of Sandoy and found an extensive windblown sand deposit . containing patches of burnt peat ash from human activity, dating human . settlement to pre-Viking times. These ash spreads contained barley grains that were burnt in domestic hearths and were then spread . by humans onto the windblown sand surface between the 4th and 6th centuries . and between the 6th and 8th centuries, a common practice identified in the North . Atlantic during this period to control wind erosion. The discovery signifies that the settlers were established on the islands and must have grown and processed barley and used peat to cook. It has long been thought that Vikings were the first settlers in the 9th Century on the windy islands, which are situated between the North Atlantic Ocean and Norwegian Sea. Pictured is Koltur Island from Streymoy Island, part of the Faroe Islands. The research, directed by Dr Mike Church from Durham University and Símun Arge from the National Museum . of the Faroe Islands, is published in the Quaternary Science Reviews. Lead author Dr Church said: 'There is now firm archaeological evidence . for the human colonisation of the Faroes by people some 300 to 500 years . before the large scale Viking colonisation of the 9th century AD, . although we don’t yet know who these people were or where they came from. 'The majority of archaeological evidence for this early colonisation is likely to have been destroyed by the major Viking invasion, explaining the lack of proof found in the Faroes for the earlier settlement. 'This also raises questions about the timing of human activity on other islands systems where similarly evidence may have been destroyed.' Dr Church told The Independent the first settlers on the islands could have been Christian hermit monks called 'anchorites' from Ireland or Scotland. The theory is supported Irish monk Dicul, who wrote in the year 825 that hermit monks from Ireland were livng on islands far north of Britain before the Vikings, although he did not explicitly name the Faroe Islands. Dr Church from Durham University said the first settlers on the islands could have been Christian hermit monks from Ireland or Scotland. He thinks the settlers would probably have lived in the sheltered bays (unlike the hilly cliffs pictured) in the same locations where the Vikings built their longhouses . Dr Church said the settlers would probably have lived in the sheltered bays found on the islands in the same locations where the Vikings built their longhouses. Consequently little evidence of the earlier settlers is likely to be found, but the archaeologists believe the anonymous people living in the bleak location in the 4th to 6th centuries AD must have been able to build boats and navigate the surrounding seas. The study said the Faroes were the first stepping . stone beyond Shetland for the dispersal of European people across the . North Atlantic that culminated on the shores of continental North . America in the 11th century AD, about 500 years before Columbus made his . famous voyage. Co-author, Mr  Arge from the National Museum of the Faroe Islands, said: 'Although . we don’t know who the people were that settled here and where they came . from, it is clear that they did prepare peat for use, by cutting, . drying and burning it which indicates they must have stayed here for . some time. 'We now have . to digest these dates of this early evidence in relation to other . sources and consider whether there may be other similar sites, elsewhere . on the islands, which may be able to provide us with further structural . archaeological evidence.'","New evidence places human .

"A couple who wed shortly after running last year's Boston Marathon have paid a touching tribute to those killed and injured in the atrocity by naming their newborn baby after the site of the double bombing. Robert and Kelli Watling from Dallas, Texas, wore trainers and their marathon medals when they married in a city park just four hours after completing the race. But just moments after the ceremony began the two bombs exploded leaving three people dead and injuring an estimated 264 others. Tribute: Marathon runners Robert Watling and Kelli Johnston, marry just hours after completing last year's Boston Marathon. Yesterday they announced the birth of a baby daughter . Despite confusion all around, the couple and their families decided to go ahead with the wedding. And yesterday they celebrated the birth of a baby girl who they have named Alexandra Copley Watling. Copley Square was the site of the finish line where the two pressure cooker bombs exploded. 'At that time, we still weren't sure who did this or why. If it was a terrorist act, we certainly weren't going to let them derail our plans,' Kelli told NECN earlier this year. The couple, who ran the Boston Marathon again this year, met at a coffee shop in 2011 and have completed many races together since . The couple had both crossed the finish line before the bombs went off 12 seconds apart on Boylston Street at around 2.50pm.on April 15th last year. The blasts claimed the lives of three people, including eight-year-old Martin Richard. Despite the scenes of carnage, the couple opted to go ahead with their low-key ceremony at 6.20pm in the park.

"From the grim-faced Edwardian woman in her patterned dress to the unsmiling visage of photographer Robert Cornelius, the world's oldest selfies are a surprisingly joyless bunch. But while modern selfies are just for fun, for the pioneering posers of the 1800s, photographic self-portraits were revolutionary. Now Mashable.com has rounded up some of the best - and the results are surprisingly impressive. Stunning: This image, which dates from 1900, shows a female photographer and her Box Brownie . Along with the woman standing beside her Kodak Box Brownie, there are group shots and even one taken outdoors in what appears to be the Alps. Other shots include a 1930s effort of a beautifully dressed woman posing with what looks like a trophy and a wonderful close-up of a tweed-suited gent taken in 1938. Like the modern selfie trend, which appeared in the wake of the social media and iPhone revolution, the vintage version was also the result of a technical innovation. The camera - and modern photography - began life in 1790 with a basic model created by the UK's Thomas Wedgwood, which, by 1826, had been developed into a device resembling modern cameras by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. Originals: Robert Cornelius in his 1839 selfie (left) and snapper Terry Fincher in an daring selfie taken in 1966 . By 1838, human beings had made their first appearance on film - an event swiftly followed by the first selfie, which was the work of American photographer Robert Cornelius and taken in 1839. But the era of the selfie didn't truly dawn until 1900, when Kodak's revolutionary Box Brownie Camera appeared on shelves. Priced at just $1 each, the cardboard device took two inch photos on 117mm roll film and sold in the millions. The Box Brownie was cheap, easy to use, and even helped to introduce the world to the concept of the snapshot. And as the image of the Edwardian woman, her Box Brownie poised at waist height, proves, it also helped to popularise the selfie. Vintage classic: A Fox Photos staff photographer captures his own image in a mirror, circa 1948 . Launched in February 1900, the Kodak Box Brownie was the first mass-produced camera. Easy to use and, at just a dollar each, cheap to buy, it revolutionised the art of photography - until then available only to a limited number of very wealthy people. Made from cardboard and in possession of a simple meniscus lens, it look tiny two-inch square photos at the push of a button. Unlike modern cameras, the viewfinder was perched on the top which meant users had to hold the device at waist height and look down. Later models included a bakelite version, the Brownie 127, of which millions were sold between 1952 and 1967. There was also a slightly more expensive spin-off model, the Beau Brownie, which used a more advanced doublet lens and were smaller than their conventional counterparts. Although the Box Brownie is no longer in production, many historical examples are still in existence and, if cared for well enough, can still create wonderful photos today.","The world's first selfie was taken in 1839 by photographer Robert Cornelius .

"The BBC has enraged Muslim staff after holding a hog roast to celebrate the Commonwealth Games - under the windows of the Arabic TV service. An entire pig was spit-roasted in the courtyard of New Broadcasting House, central London, with wafts of meat drifting up to the predominantly Muslim office. Staff in the department whose religion bans them from eating pork blasted the 'horror' at spotting the carcass on their lunch break. Scroll down for video . Anger: Muslim BBC employees have berated the Corporation for holding a hog roast in the courtyard of New Broadcasting House, where the Arabic TV service is based, to celebrate the Commonwealth Games . The event on Friday, celebrating the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, was held just days after the close of Ramadan, a month of fasting for Muslims for spiritual reflection. Sharing a photo of a scorched pig's head covered in juice, an Iranian journalist wrote: 'Horror in my lunch break at BBC New Broadcasting House.' The Corporation routinely promotes 'diversity' values, and issues all employees with a welcome pack, that includes a survey with questions about their religion, sexual orientation, financial background, and any disabilities. It is a bid to 'ensure we meet diversity targets', bosses claim. 'Horror': The carcass was roasted outside the John Peel Wing days after the end of Ramadan (file image) However, an insider berated the hog roast as 'disrespectful', claiming the hog was 'being flaunted', according to The Sun on Sunday. A BBC spokesman said: 'We have received no complaints'. The food festival set up outside the John Peel Wing, where the Arabic TV service is based on the fourth floor. The Arabic TV service is one of the Corporation's flagship channels, covering 32 countries. The team has been significantly expanded since 2008, when it officially launched.","Hog roast held outside John Peel Wing, where Arabic service is based .

"A woman in her 50s will give birth to her own children after becoming a surrogate mother for her infertile daughter. Cathy Donnelly, 58, is six months pregnant and will welcome her seventh grandchild into the world when she gives birth to her - before daughter Shannon Fischer raises the baby. Mrs Fischer and her husband Jamie had been trying for two years when they discovered they couldn’t conceive due to scarring in her uterus. So Mrs Donnelly mother of three and a grandmother of six, volunteered to be a surrogate mother for her daughter. Cathy Donnelly (red top) is six months pregnant with her own grandchild. Her daughter Shannon can't have children due to scarring on her uterus . Mrs Fischer said: 'The day I came home from my surgery mum said ""I'll do it"". She didn't hesitate.' Mrs Donnelly, from London in Ontario, Canada, said: 'I felt bad for them - I just thought what’s nine months of my life? They are going to have a child for the rest of theirs? It's not like I'm busy doing anything.' Michael Murray, specialist at the . Northern California Fertility Medical Center, says though there have . been cases of mothers acting as surrogate for their daughters before it . is typically something the medical community does not advise. He said: 'Usually it’s a close friend . or a sister that acts as the gestational carrier - women who are over . 45-years-old are not normally in good enough health. 'Pregnancy for older women is much . riskier. The most common complications are high blood pressure, . gestational diabetes and premature child birth.' But they were risks Mrs Donnelly was willing . to accept and while she admits her pregnancy hasn’t been easy, she has . had no complications so far. 'It was long process and involved a heavy dose of fertility drugs for both of us but in the end it all paid off. 'I was standing in line for a coffee when I got a call from my doctor confirming I was pregnant. I was just bawling - people must have thought someone close to me died. 'But it has been challenging. Now I’m showing I make sure people aren’t staring or looking at me because they’re probably thinking ‘look at that old lady.' Mrs Donnelly  said she did question whether she was doing the right thing and if everything would work out okay until she started to feel the baby move. Now her only concerns are about how she will feel once she has given birth. 'I don't know if I'll feel like I've lost her, I don't know how I'm going to feel,' Mrs Donnelly said. Shannon plans to name her daughter Zoey Hope Catherine after her mother. And for her the whole experience has made her cherish their mother-daughter relationship even more. She said: 'It just changes your relationship 360 degrees. We were close before but it’s just on a whole new level. I want to be like she is to my own daughter, that caring and willing to do stuff for her.'","Grandmother Cathy has already gone through the menopause, but said she had wanted to be the surrogate despite the health risks .

"A young British jihadist who appeared in a chilling ISIS recruitment video has posted photographs of the destruction caused to a Syrian army base by one of his homemade bombs. Nasser Muthana - the 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in ISIS' first professionally produced English language propaganda video - uploaded before and after images of a military building being destroyed in an ISIS-controlled area in the north of the country. The images come just a month after the young jihadist posted a message on Twitter warning that the UK government should be afraid of him returning to the country with his new bomb making skills. Scroll down for video .

Following his chilling threat to the UK, Muthana uploaded his images with the stark warning: 'Army base buildings before and after, I'm getting good with these bombs.' They were accompanied by gruesome images of the badly burned remains of what Muthana said were dead Syrian government soldiers, although there is no indication the men had been inside the building at the time of the blast. As well as posting the photographs, Muthana also said ISIS fighters would slaughter any Yazidi men they captured in northern Iraq and would enslave their women and children. 'Kuffar [non-believers] are afraid we . will slaughter Yazidis, our deen [religious path] is clear we will kill . their men, take their women and children as slaves insha Allah,' he posted on Twitter.

Formerly a prospective medical student, he was joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17, who has now spoken of his willingness to die fighting for ISIS. The Muthana brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from Yemen as a teenager, are among hundreds of young men from Britain who have flown to Syria to join the rebels. Find: Muthana claims to have found this prayer mat inside the army base. He says it offers devotion to the Prophet Mohammed's daughter and is therefore in breach of Islamic law as evidence of practicing idolatry . Friends: Reyaad Khan (left), who is also from Cardiff, appeared alongside Muthana (right) in the ISIS propaganda video, urging other young Muslims in the West to join them in jihad . Their friend Reyaad Khan, 20, also from Cardiff, said he had 'fireworks' for the U.S. if they returned to fight in Iraq. Nasser . posted the warning of his bomb-making skills on his new Twitter page . @abulmuthanna313 after deleting his previous profile last month. He was reportedly unhappy with the high levels of attention it received following his appearance in ISIS' recruitment video. Khan, who uses the Twitter handle @AbuDujanaRK, appeared alongside Muthana in the video, urging other young Muslims in the West to join them in jihad. Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana are among the British jihadists fighting with ISIS in Iraq that are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics. The extremists, who boast of ‘slaughtering’ innocent Yazidis and ‘taking their women as slaves’, are advising 15-year-olds that they are ‘not too young’ to die fighting for Allah. Asked by a British 18-year-old girl if she is too young to join, one of them replied: ‘I know sisters younger than you. I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young.’ They are informing their British ‘brothers and sisters’ every day how to make their way to Iraq, claiming they are ‘ordered’ to defy their parents and fight jihad. The British IS fighters, who refer to themselves as the ‘Baadiya Boys’ after their original base in Syria, include Khan and Muthana. The former Catholic college students have been joined on the frontline by young Muslim men and women from across the UK, including a group of five friends from Portsmouth, two of whom have already been killed.","Nasser Muthana, 20, posted images of destroyed military building on Twitter .

"Scientists have discovered a vast reservoir of water under the Earth's mantle they say could be larger than all the ocean's combined. Canadian researchers say analysis of a rare mineral points to the huge store of water deep in Earth's mantle, 400-600 kilometres (250-375 miles) beneath our feet. It echoes the hundred and fifty year old novel, 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth', in which French science-fiction forerunner Jules Verne pictured a vast sea that lay deep under our planet's surface. The evidence comes from a water-loving mineral called ringwoodite that came from the so-called transition zone sandwiched between the upper and lower layers of Earth's mantle . The new theory, backed up by seismic data suggest that water is stored in the transition zone of Earth’s mantle. It is thought to host minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite that can store water like a sponge. If water does exists in huge volumes beneath Earth's crust, it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates. The evidence comes from a water-loving mineral called ringwoodite that came from the so-called transition zone sandwiched between the upper and lower layers of Earth's mantle, they said in the journal Nature. Analysis shows that 1.5% of the rock comprises molecules of water. The find backs once-contested theories that the transition zone, or at least significant parts of it, is water-rich, the investigators said. 'This sample really provides extremely strong confirmation that there are local wet spots deep in the Earth in this area,' said Graham Pearson of Canada's University of Alberta, who led the research. 'That particular zone in the Earth, the transition zone, might have as much water as all the world's oceans put together.' Ringwoodite is named after Australian geologist Ted Ringwood, who theorised that a special mineral was bound to be created in the transition zone because of the ultra-high pressures and temperatures there. A piece of this mineral has been a long-sought goal. Where it is: Researchers say the rongwoodite reveals the Earth's transition zone could be a vast reservoir of water . It would resolve a long-running debate about whether the poorly-understood transition zone is bone-dry or water-rich. But, until now, ringwoodite has only ever been found in meteorites. Geologists had simply been unable to delve deep enough to find any sample on Earth. Good fortune, though, changed all this. In 2008, amateur gem-hunters digging in shallow river gravel in the Juina area of Mato Grasso, Brazil, came across a tiny, grubby stone called a brown diamond. Graham Pearson holds the first terrestrial sample of ringwoodite ever found - which led to the discovery . Ringwoodite is a form of the mineral peridot, believed to exist in large quantities under high pressures in the transition zone. Ringwoodite has been found in meteorites but, until now, no terrestrial sample has ever been unearthed because scientists haven’t been able to conduct fieldwork at extreme depths. It is named after Australian geologist Ted Ringwood, who theorised that a special mineral was bound to be created in the transition zone because of the ultra-high pressures and temperatures there. Measuring just three millimetres (0.12 inches) across and commercially worthless, the stone was acquired by the scientists when they were on a quest for other minerals. But the accidental acquisition turned out to be a bonanza. In its interior, they found a microscopic trace of ringwoodite -- the very first terrestrial evidence of the ultra-rare rock. 'It's so small, this inclusion, it's extremely difficult to find, never mind work on,' Pearson said in a press release, paying tribute to the diligent work of grad student John McNeill. 'It was a bit of a piece of luck, this discovery, as are many scientific discoveries.' The team theorise that the brown diamond rocketed to the surface during a volcanic eruption, hitchhiking in a stream of kimberlite, the deepest of all volcanic rocks. Years of analysis, using spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, were needed in specialised labs to confirm the find officially as ringwoodite. Scientists have debated for decades about whether the transition zone has water, and if so, how much of the precious stuff there might be. None, though, has embraced Verne's fancy of a subterranean sea with a rocky coastline dotted with forests of giant mushrooms and petrified trees. The $20 diamond that led to the discovery: Diamond sample JUc29, from Juina, Brazil, containing the hydrous ringwoodite inclusion. The rough diamond has been naturally sculptured to its unusual shape by corrosive mantle fluids during transport to the surface. Hans Keppler, a geologist at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, cautioned against extrapolating the size of the subterranean water find from a single sample of ringwoodite. And he also said the water was likely to be locked up in specific rocks, in a molecular form called hydroxyl. 'In some ways it is an ocean in Earth's interior, as visualised by Jules Verne... although not in the form of liquid water,' Keppler said in a commentary also published by Nature. The implications of the discovery are profound, Pearson suggested. Schematic partial cross section of the Earth showing the location of ringwoodite, which make up approximately 60% by volume of this part of the transition zone. The diamond containing the water-bearing ringwoodite inclusion found by originated from approximately 500 km beneath the Earth's surface, where a large mass of water may accumulate by the subduction and recycling of oceanic lithosphere, into the transition zone. If water exists in huge volumes beneath Earth's crust, it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates. 'One of the reasons the Earth is such a dynamic planet is the presence of some water in its interior. Water changes everything about the way a planet works,' said Pearson.","Believed to be 400-600 kilometres (250-375 miles) beneath our feet .

"A Chinese university student has found an interesting way of staying awake when pulling all-nighters and writing essays. Chen Tang, 20, had struggled to fit her workload into the daylight hours and together with her roommate Huang Lu, 21, sought a solution to her problem.

"A newly-discovered dinosaur species has been named after the little girl who stumbled across its remains when she was just five years old. Palaeontologists announced this week that fossilised remains found on a stretch of Isle of Wight beach in 2008 had been finally identified as a new species of flying dinosaur. The remains were discovered by Daisy Morris, who, now aged nine, has amassed a collection of fossils and animal remains so extensive it led one expert to describe her bedroom as 'resembling a natural history museum.' Daisy Morris with her collection of fossils, stuffed animals, shells and bones . An artist's impression of a crow-sized species of prehistoric flying reptile dating from 115 million years ago which was discovered by Daisy Morris, five, who is to now have the species named after her as Vectidraco daisymorrisa . She made the find on a family walk along along Atherfield Beach on the south coast of the Isle of Wight, close to their home in Whitwell. Daisy spotted the remains and realised it was a fossil, and the family took it to dinosaur expert Martin Simpson, who recognised its potential importance. For the past five years, experts Darren Naish and Gareth Dyke have painstakingly studied the fossil, focusing on even the most smallest of details, before eventually publishing their findings this week. They revealed the creature was roughly the size of a crow and was a previously unknown type of pterosaur. The family has donated the remains to the Natural History Museum. And when it came to naming the creature, the experts looked to its young finder for inspiration, officially dubbing it Vectidraco Daisymorrisae. A children's book has even been written about her as a result, called Daisy and the Wight Dragon - with the title based on the translation of Vectidraco or Dragon of the Wight. Atherfield Beach: Daisy made the find on a family walk along along the beach on the south coast of the Isle of Wight, close to their home in Whitwell. 'When I told my friends about it they said it was cool,' said Daisy, a pupil at Niton Primary School.Daisy is well known for her unusual collection. Vectidraco Daisymorrisae was roughly the size of a crow and was a previously unknown type of pterosaur. The flying reptile is from 115 million years ago in the Lower . Cretaceous period. With a pelvis length of 40 mm, the new animal would have had a total length of 350 mm, and a wingspan of 750 mm, the researchers say. The . pterosaur has now been donated to the Natural History Museum which . recently named the Isle of Wight as the 'dinosaur capital of Great . Britain'. While many girls her own age choosing to cover their wall with posters of pop stars, Daisy has dedicated her room to the study of animals and dinosaurs. Mum Sian, 44, said: 'She is fascinated by it. 'If we are in the car and we go past an animal that has died, she'll ask me to stop so we can pick it up and she can take it home. 'She'll put them under a crate in the garden and let it decompose. 'The flies lay eggs and maggots clean the skeleton, then she collects the bones. 'If your child is good at drawing or dancing and they enjoy it, then you encourage them and this is what Daisy enjoys, so her Dad and I have never said eurgh, we've tried to encourage her. 'Rather than say that's disgusting, we'd like to help her find out about things. She's fascinated and we're very proud of her.' When she was just six Daisy contacted BBC Springwatch to ask the experts how long it would take for a dead mole she had found to decompose. Daisy Morris, who aged five discovered a species of prehistoric flying reptile dating from 115 million years ago . The far-from-squeamish youngster also has the skull of bull, she keeps in the living room, and several mummified animals, including a frog and a shrew. Knowing of her unusual interest, neighbours sometimes bring round the bodies of birds their cats have killed, while friends and relatives will sometimes animals remains to her in the post to add to her collection. Martin Simpson, who himself has a collection of 50,000 specimens he hopes to soon house in a purpose-built centre on the Isle of Wight, said Daisy's discovery had been vital. 'It's likely that if she had not picked this up, it would have washed away that day and might never have been found. 'It shows how amateurs and academics can work together and make some really important discoveries. The bones found by Daisy Morris which led to the discovery of a new dinosaur . The bones found by Daisy are part of the dinosaur's pelvis . 'She is a fascinating and unique girl. 'She has an amazing collection of real and fossilised bones, shells, skulls and teeth and her bedroom now resembles a natural history museum.' 'When Daisy and her family brought the fossilised remains to me in April . 2009, I knew I was looking at something very special - and I was right. 'The . fossil turned out to be a completely new genus and species of small . pterosaur, a flying reptile from 115 million years ago in the Lower . Cretaceous period, which because of the island’s eroding coastline, . would without doubt have been washed away and destroyed if it had not . been found by Daisy. 'It just shows that, continuing a long . tradition in palaeontology, major discoveries can be made by amateurs, . often by being in the right place at the right time.' The . pterosaur has since been donated to the Natural History Museum which . recently named the Isle of Wight as the “dinosaur capital of Great . Britain'. And Daisy doesn't plan to stop any time soon. 'I just want to keep collecting things,"" she said.","Spotted on a family walk on Atherfield Beach on the south coast of the Isle of Wight .

"An American Airlines flight was delayed for 17 hours at LAX because a passenger spotted an 'Al-Quida Free Terror Nettwork' while trying to connect to the WiFi on board. The aircraft bound for London turned back to the gate after a flight attendant was shown the list of hotspots while taxiing. Passengers were then forced to get off of the plane with some having to stay in hotels overnight while waiting for the next available flight. Scroll down for video . Security concern: American Airlines flight AA136 from LAX to London was delayed for 17 hours after a passenger told a flight attendant a WiFi connection called 'Al-Quida Free Terror Nettwork' was available . The flight was supposed to take off at 8pm on Sunday night but was rescheduled to take off at 1pm today. According to ABC 7, the airline is assessing the situation and law enforcement has been notified. Kevin Simon, who lives in Orange County but is from the UK, told Mail Online that the plane was stationary for one-and-a-half hours before they returned to the gate. Passengers were told that there was a 'minor security issue' that had to be dealt with, but the pilot and crew never fully explained what was going on. He added: 'Never once did the pilot mention what the exact problem was. I only found out about the WiFi hotspot name after I got back home and googled for any clues. 'There were a few airport police on the jetway by the door as we deplaned. When I went past them, they didn't appear to have arrested anyone. 'While at the baggage carousel a few passengers were talking, and a lady who had been near the front said that she was sitting near the air marshalls, and when the event happened, both of them jumped up and got busy, with one of them stationing himself in front of the cockpit door.

"Thousands of supporters of Muslim Brotherhood have been demonstrating in Egypt today, in protest of the unseating of Mohammed Morsi, pledging to occupy a Cairo square until the ex-president is reinstated. The large crowd were waving pictures of the ousted president, chanting anti-military slogans and branding the Egyptian army chief, who let the military's removal of Morsi, a traitor. The unseating of Mr Morsi came as a result of nationwide demonstrations against the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood, which were elected into power following the 'Arab Spring'. Scroll down for video . Pro-Morsi: Egyptian supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi demonstrate against the military coup, Cairo, Egypt earlier this week . It was a bitter blow to the Brotherhood, which won a string of ballots, including Mr Morsi's election as president. One speaker at today's demonstration pledged to stay on the streets until The Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi are reinstated. ‘We are ready to stay for a month, two months, a year or even two years,’ ultraconservative Islamist Salafi cleric Safwat Hegazi told protesters. This week more than 50 pro-Morsi protesters were killed in a clash with the military. Earlier prosecutors said they will investigate allegations that Mr Morsi escaped from prison during the 2011 revolution against the rule of dictator Hosni Mubarak with help from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Occupy Cairo: Supporters of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood swore today not to budge until the elected president is reinstated to power . Chief prosecutor Hesham Barakat has received testimonies from a court in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia that will be the base for a probe into the jailbreak by Mr Morsi and more than 30 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders. The question of whether Hamas helped them escape amid the chaos surrounding the 2011 uprising has been debated in the media for months. It proved a political headache for Mr Morsi during his one-year rule as Egypt's first freely elected president. Critics in the opposition and judiciary have suggested that proof of foreign intervention on Egyptian soil could lead to treason charges. The toppled Islamist leader has been kept at an undisclosed Defence Ministry facility and no charges against him have been announced. Violence: Morsi supporters rally during a funeral of protestors killed during violent clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and the military on Monday . Hamas has denied any role in the January 29, 2011, jailbreak at Wadi el-Natroun prison north-west of Cairo. Mr Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders have said local residents helped them escape after most inmates left the jail. News of the intended investigation came a day after the authorities issued arrest warrants for the Brotherhood's spiritual leader, Mohammed Badie, and nine other Islamists accused of inciting violence after deadly clashes. The warrants drew an angry response from the Brotherhood, which said ‘dictatorship is back’ and insisted it will never work with the interim rulers. Mr Badie's whereabouts are not known, but many of the others are believed to be taking refuge near a sit-in by the group's supporters outside the Rabaah al-Adawiya Mosque in a Cairo district that is a Brotherhood stronghold.","Pro-Morsi protesters pledge to occupy Cairo square until he is reinstated .

All hands on deck: Officials carry Electronic Voting Machines towards a counting centre in Agartala . The Congress-led ruling alliance has been plagued by repeated corruption scandals, and the Congress party's 43-year-old leader, Rahul Gandhi, failed to inspire public confidence. A party or coalition needs at least 272 seats to form a government in India. If the BJP crosses the 272-mark, it would be the first time a single party has won a majority since the 1984 national election. Exit polls by at least six major Indian TV stations predicted a BJP-led coalition would win between 249 and 289 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament. By Friday afternoon, an exact picture was expected to emerge on what India's next Parliament will look like. If the results are in line with the exit polls and the early trends and the BJP and its allies win a clear majority, India's stock markets are likely to see a major upswing. Mammoth task: Election officials open an Electronic Voting Machine at a counting centre in New Delhi . Already on Friday, the Sensex stock index rose as much as 4.7 per cent on news of the BJP's strong showing. The Nehru-Gandhi family, which has ruled India for all but 10 years since the country won independence from British rule in 1947, was facing its biggest political drubbing in 10 years. The Congress party attempted to position Rahul Gandhi as a young leader capable of boosting the country's struggling economy, but most Indians see him as being out of touch with reality. His privileged background has made him appear aloof and removed from the concerns of most Indians. In comparison, Modi's campaign was seen by many as a media and marketing coup for a man whose background ties him to bloodshed in his home state of Gujarat, where communal rioting in 2002 left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims. Modi, the son of a tea seller who helped man his father's stall, is accused of doing little to stop the rampage, though he denies any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime. He managed to hammer away at Gandhi - specifically the perception that he is nothing more than a feudal prince from a family that views ruling the country as its birthright. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has defined Indian politics for nearly a century faces more than a humiliating election defeat. The landslide victory for opposition leader Narendra Modi could condemn the family to political oblivion. Often . described as a mixture of a royal family with the tragic glamour of the . Kennedys, the dynasty gave India its first prime minister, the . empire-beating barrister Jawaharlal Nehru. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson, Rajiv, both held the post subsequently, and both were assassinated. By some measures, the family was in decline long before the parliamentary election; it has not won a majority in decades. India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru (left) jokes with Mahatma Gandhi, who led India to independence in 1947 after nearly 200 years of British rule . Shy . scion Rahul Gandhi's bid to keep the Congress party in power for a . third consecutive term was called lacklustre even by allies, and his . speeches at rallies up and down the country in recent months were a far . cry from Nehru's legendary rhetoric. Compare . that with Modi's electrifying campaign, during which he repeatedly . derided Rahul, 43, and his mother Sonia for keeping India poor, and the . house of Gandhi looks vulnerable. Few would write off the clan completely. Sonia, . the power behind the prime ministerial throne occupied by Manmohan . Singh, delivered Congress its worst result to date in 1999.

"The research arm of the Pentagon announced a technological breakthrough Thursday, releasing footage that shows successful tests of self-guided .50 caliber bullets, claimed to be the first of its kind. According to a news release by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program recently conducted it's first successful live test of the bullets. The video released by the agency shows a live test-fire of the bullet, which was shot at a path pointed away from its intended target. In the more recent firing of the bullet, dated April 21, 2014, it is shown curving back towards its target, hitting the mark. Scroll Down for Video . The successful testing of EXACTO was announced by the Pentagon this week . DARPA's prototype model of EXACTO, which will increased the distance away from a target snipers can successful shoot . According to the video, EXACTO is being developed by Teledyne Scientific & Imaging, with funding from DARPA. Teledyne is a research and development firm based in Thousand Oaks, California. Teledyne was awarded a contract worth $25 million in 2010 to develop EXACTO. According to DARPA's release, 'EXACTO’s specially designed ammunition and real-time optical guidance . system help track and direct projectiles to their targets by . compensating for weather, wind, target movement and other factors that . could impede successful hits.' DARPA says that the bullet created by the project will improve the range of snipers, and improve troop safety as they will be able to shoot and neutralize a target from further away. Currently, US Snipers are expected to be able to hit a target 600 meters away, 90 per cent of the time. With the advent of EXACTO, an increased range to 2,000 meters is promised. Despite DARPA's claim that EXACTO is the first bullet of it's kind, in 2012, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin named Sandia National Laboratories, which does research and development with the US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, claimed to be developing their own self-guided bullet. Snipers will now be able to hit their targets without interference from unfavorable weather conditions . EXACTO is not the only kind of self-guiding bullet in development and funded by the US government. Another company in California is also working on a prototype for a bullet guided by lasers . Sandia's bullet uses lasers for guidance, as opposed to EXACTO's onboard computer system (the specific working of EXACTO are classified.) According to Sandia's website, additional development is needed before a full prototype or test can be performed. However, unlike EXACTO, Sandia plans to make their bullets available to law enforcement in addition to the military. According to DARPA, the next phase of the development of EXACTO is to refine the accuracy and performance of the technology.","EXACTO, a self-guided bullet tested in Spring 2014, successful in being shot pointed away from intended target and still hitting it .

This, rather unappealingly, is a scenario Chinese scientists say could be the future of space exploration. They claim mealworms are high in protein and are ideal for long space trips, and to prove it they shut three volunteers away for 105 days and placed them on a diet of just larvae and plants. Captain Xie Beizhen (centre) and crew members Wang Minjuan (right) and Dong Chen (left) of the 'Moon Palace One' pose for photos in front of the chamber for cultivating plants after living in the closed lab for 105 days on 20 May 2014 in Beijing, China . The volunteers, one man and two women, lived inside an enclosed biosphere at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. 15 October 2003 . China became the third nation to send a human into space when Yang Liwei orbited the Earth aboard Shenzhou 5. 12 October 2005 . China’s second manned mission saw two taikonauts orbit Earth for five days. 25 September 2008 . Three taikonauts travelled to space on China’s third manned mission, with Zhai Zhigang performing China’s first ever spacewalk. 16 June 2012 . Liu Wang became China’s first woman in space in June 2012, and also took part in the mission that docked with the space laboratory Tiangong-1 for the first time. 11 June 2013 . China’s most recent space mission was Shenzhou 10 almost a year ago. They have big plans in future, though, including building a fully operational space station in Earth orbit and sending humans to the moon. Known as Moon Palace One, the biosphere is 1,700 square feet (160 square metres) and has three rooms, one being living quarters and the other two greenhouses of sorts to grow plants and keep the mealworms. Technology such as fuel cells allowed the volunteers to be self-sufficient. The idea behind the study was to ascertain if eating worms for a prolonged amount of time was feasible in terms of both morale and nutrition for space missions. According to the South China Morning Post, the idea has been met with criticism in the West where critics say, despite the high protein content, having to eat mealworms would lower morale in astronauts owing to their unappealing look and taste. However, it appears the volunteers were more than happy to chow down on mealworms, suggesting they could be the meal of choice for future astronauts, known as taikonauts in China. ‘It did take them some time to adapt to the diet,’ Hu Dawei, a researcher involved in the project, told the SCMP. ‘None of them had ever tried them as food before. ‘The process was not difficult to manage. They all seemed healthy and happy throughout the experiment.’ The volunteers ate only laboratory-grown plants and insects such as mealworms (stock image shown). This was China's first manned test of the 'Moon Palace One', a 500-cubic metre (17,700 cubic feet) module that is China's first and the world's third bioregenerative life support base . Captain Xie Beizhen (front) and crew members Wang Minjuan (middle) and Dong Chen (rear) of the 'Moon Palace One' walk out of the closed lab clutching some of the plants they grew inside. It is hoped this experiment will help future space missions . Mealworms are said to be made of over 76 per cent protein, making them highly nutritious. During this experiment, however, the volunteers weren’t able to get all the nutrients they needed from those insects alone – some meals had to be supplemented with more regular foods. They also fattened up the mealworms, which can grow to the size of a finger in a month, with plants. The next stage for the research will be to add a third greenhouse to the Moon Palace One facility, which will enable a fourth volunteer to be added on a future experiment. This should also mean the next set of volunteers can be entirely self-sufficient on worms and vegetables kept in the biosphere. And ultimately it is hoped that the research could give future Chinese astronauts a suitable food source that is nourishing. ‘The United Nations has recommended mealworms for starving people in poor areas such as Africa, so we thought why can't they be used by astronauts in space,"" Dawei continued. ‘Worms may look disgusting at first glance, but they are actually the cleanest and healthiest food source.’ China's manned space programme began in 2003 and has come on leaps and bounds since then. Here, Chinese watch the launch of China's first manned space flight at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwestern province of Gansu on 15 October with China's first astronaut, Yang Liwei, on board .","Astronauts could one day be chowing down on insects on long missions .

"Only whites: Lakim Faust picked his victims according to skin color, only shooting whites, officials said . A man who shot four people near a Greenville Wal-Mart in June picked out his victims because they were white, according to several indictments handed down against him. Lakim Faust had more than 100 rounds of ammunition when he started shooting at people who were standing outside at a law firm and a shopping center in June, authorities said. A grand jury indicted Faust on 14 charges Monday, including four counts of attempted first-degree murder. Faust, who is black, picked out his victims based on their race, according to the indictments. The documents didn’t specify why Faust wanted to shoot white people, and police have not talked about why he picked out his targets. Earlier reports had indicated that Faust was  shooting 'indiscriminately.' Police said Faust’s first victim on June 21 was an insurance adjustor in the parking lot of a law firm. He then crossed a five-lane highway and shot three more people in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart, investigators said. Three of the four people wounded in the shooting suffered permanent and debilitating injuries, according to the indictments. Details of those injuries were not specified. Faust, 23, was shot by police. He recovered and is now in jail. Police seized computers and documents from Faust’s home that showed he had a plan for the attack and wanted to shoot a large number of people, investigators said.","Lakim Faust shot four people in June at a Greenville, N.C., Wal-Mart .

"Residents at housing flats in South London have criticised the building's segregated entrances policy, where one doorway is set aside for the rich and the other for its housing association tenants. London Mayor Boris Johnson recently faced calls to ban ‘poor doors’ in upmarket blocks of flats, which force people on low incomes to use different entrances. But developers in London are promising wealthy tenants they will not have to share their smart lobby entrances, courtyard gardens or secure parking with people living in flats classed as ‘affordable housing’. Scroll down for video . The entrance to the rich part of the housing development, where private tenants enter and exit .

A resident named only as Donna told the Sunday Mirror she and her family must enter the flats . through the 'poor door' - an entrance without the concierge or . 24 hour service her wealthy neighbours enjoy around the corner. She said: 'I've never felt poorer in my life because of the way we're kept apart. 'I don't want my kids thinking they deserve to be treated differently. It's humiliating and wrong.' The . practice faces being banned in New York after a backlash and has sparked . a political row in the UK with Labour condemning the covert . ‘segregation’. The housing block in Woolwich where tenants are frustrated they are being segregated from wealthier neighbours . The problem stems from rules which are supposed to stop areas becoming ghettos for the very rich. When planning permission is granted, developers are often told to set aside a set number of units for affordable housing. From the outside, there is often no way of telling the more basic homes from the hi-spec apartments aimed at the super-rich. But behind the façade, less well-off tenants are forced to enter through different doors and use separate bicycle racks, bins and post boxes. Labour’s shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds told MailOnline: ‘I am strongly against this kind of segregation. There shouldn’t be separate doors for people living in affordable housing. ‘Many of the developers that I have been to haven’t had this distinction but I am deeply concerned that it is something happening in the UK.’","Developers, forced to set aside units .

"An Ohio community was up in arms after a suspected drunk driver veered off the road into a shallow pond near a community center, marking the driver's sixth arrest for driving while impaired. The police department in Massillon, Ohio decided to use the drunken crash as a teaching moment, posting a picture of the driver’s hunter green Dodge pickup truck half submerged in water, on their Facebook page and warning area residents of the dangers of drunk driving. Police say Robert Schreckengost failed to negotiate a turn on a winding road in downtown Massillon and his truck ended up in a retention pond shortly before midnight on Saturday, behind the Massillon Recreation Center. The photo says it all: Police posted this picture of a Dodge pickup truck driven by Robert Schreckengost, who police suspect was drunk, in a shallow pond near a community center in Massillon, Ohio . A sign with an 'arrow shows the road doesn't go any further but he apparently didn't see that and he plowed right through,' Station Sgt. John DiLoreto said. 6 strikes and you're out: Robert Schreckengost was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, his sixth arrest for the offense . The 42-year-old driver, who police say smelled of alcohol, was able to exit his vehicle but fire fighters and police were called to the scene to deal with the truck. Though the man had no visible injuries, he was transported to a local hospital to be checked. Police administered a urine test but the results have not yet been released. They say that there is no evidence to suspect any illegal drugs were involved. The Massillon Police Department posted a photo of the mishap on their Facebook page on Sunday, writing to local residents, 'Another reminder of the dangers of OVI.' The posting amassed 49 likes on the social-networking website but many users wondered why the driver was still allowed on the road despite his multiple run-ins with the law. 'Why do people with more than 1 or even 2 ovi offenses still have a license to drive?' Kerri Everly wrote, with another local demanding, 'Lock him up for Pete's sake!!!' Crash: The man drove his truck into a shallow pond behind the Massillon Recreation Center, a fitness and activity center for the community. The center was closed at the time of the accident on Saturday night . 'Lucky he didn't kill anyone...with 5 previous ovi convictions this will be his 6th you can't rehabilitate this guy just do everyone including him a favor and keep him locked up,' another resident, Kevin L Carpenter, vented. Schreckengost was driving on a suspended license. After getting the all-clear from doctors after the incident, Schreckengost was transported to the Stark County Jail on a felony OVI (operating a vehicle impaired) charge, and charges of driving under suspension and operating without reasonable control. He was arraigned on Monday and has pleaded not guilty. He is being held at the Stark County Jail, on $50,000 bond and is next scheduled to appear in court on September 5. His vehicle was impounded. The Massillon Recreation Center, where the incident occurred, is a fitness and activity facility for the community of Massillon, located south of Cleveland, that has an estimated population of 32,000.

"Scotland's friendly against Nigeria in London on Wednesday night is being investigated by police after claims that attempts have been made to fix the match. National Crime Agency officers, who investigate serious and organised crime, have tipped off world governing body FIFA over possible attempts to rig the fixture. There is no suggestion of Gordon Strachan's Scotland players being involved in any potential scam. Neither is there a threat to Nigeria’s pre-World Cup warm up at Fulham’s Craven Cottage, where 10,000 Tartan Army footsoldiers are expected to be following their team. Friendly fire: Scotland, with (from left) Leigh Griffiths, Scott Brown, Charlie Mulgrew and Ikechi Anya in their ranks, trained at Harrlington on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday night's friendly against Nigeria . On the ball: Gordon Strachan will look to continue his impressive run as Scotland boss . However, SFA head of security Peter McLaughlin has been in touch with National Crime Agency for the last three days after the agency – Britain’s equivalent of the FBI – received general intelligence concerning the London clash. The SFA declined to comment but confirmed they are aware of the matter. Neither would the National Crime Agency offer a public comment. But a spokesman said: 'The NCA will from time to time provide operational detail necessary for public reassurance purposes. It does not routinely confirm or deny the existence of specific operations or provide ongoing commentary on operational activity.' Putting in a shift: Coach Stuart McCall puts Steven Naismith through his paces ahead of the Nigeria match . Up and running: Scotland have put together some decent results under Strachan's guidance . The NCA take an interest in any intelligence from gambling commission and have told FIFA they have general information from the Asian betting markets suggesting a potential scam is afoot – and hope to stop the activities in their tracks by issuing an alert. The issue is returning to the fore ahead of World Cup warm-up matches expected to be targetted by match fixers acting on behalf of illegal betting syndicates in the Far East. There have been a series of arrests following suspected attempts to fix matches in the lower English football leagues in recent months. There have also been allegations of illicit activity in cricket. FIFA have plans in place to combat the threat of match-fixing during the World Cup, which kicks off next month. Ralf Mutschke, head of security with the governing body, told the Telegraph: 'FIFA, and in particular myself, has to make the presumption that the World Cup itself is under threat and implement the maximum protection for our competition as we can. We are trying to protect the World Cup from fixing and we have set up a pretty wide range of measures to do so.'

"British soldiers saw prisoners being hooded, given electric shocks and kept in cells the size of dog kennels for prolonged periods at Camp Nama (file photo) British troops working at a secretive US detention centre in Iraq saw prisoners being given electric shocks, brutally beaten and locked in ‘kennels’, it was claimed last night. For the first time, servicemen at the notorious Camp Nama in Baghdad have spoken of how they saw Americans abuse and torture terror suspects. One captive had his false leg pulled off and was beaten around the head with it, they said. But when the troops complained about the treatment, a British Army officer said: ‘You didn’t see that – do you understand?’ The claims will fuel suspicions that military chiefs and ministers turned a blind eye to the abuse. The allegations follow the scandal over Baha Mousa, a civilian beaten to death by British troops in Iraq in 2003 and abuses at the US-run Abu Ghraib prison. At Camp Nama, two RAF squadrons and an Army Air Corps unit had guard and transport duties while SAS and SBS troops were based nearby. The joint US-UK special forces unit, code-named Task Force 121, worked to seize key insurgents.But few British personnel were allowed into the camp’s interrogation area. This included a room with every surface painted black, where the worst abuses are said to have been carried out. British forces have told how they witnessed Iraqi prisoners being tortured in a secret US detention centre in Baghdad International Airport (file photo) On the tenth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, former UK  personnel have come forward. Two SAS members told how they saw two Iraqi prisoners being tortured in an area run by Delta Force, the US special forces unit. One said: ‘They were given electric shocks from cattle prods and their heads were held under the water in the swimming pool.’ Witnesses said prisoners were held in cells the size of large dog kennels made of wire mesh and corrugated iron. Geoff Hoon, who was defence secretary at the time, insisted he had no knowledge of Camp Nama . One told The Guardian: ‘The prisoners . were taken into a hangar to be bagged and tagged, a bag put over their . heads and their hands plasticuffed behind their backs. They would be . driven to the Joint Operations Centre. They were in pretty poor shape . when they were taken out.’ 'Everyone's seen the Abu Ghraib pictures. But I've seen it with my own eyes.' Another former soldier said: 'I saw one . man having his prosthetic leg being pulled off him, and being beaten . about the head with it before he was thrown onto the truck.' Suspects were brought to the secret prison at Baghdad international airport, known as Camp Nama for questioning by both US military and civilian interrogators. Their methods were so brutal that they drew condemnation not only from a US human rights body but from a special investigator reporting to the Pentagon. The Guardian reports that Geoff Hoon, defence secretary at the time, insisted he had no knowledge of the camp or the activities carried out there. When it was pointed out to him that the British military had provided transport services and a guard force, and had helped to detain Nama’s inmates, he reportedly replied: ‘I’ve never heard of the place.’ In the same manner the MoD has repeatedly failed to address questions about ministerial approval of British operations at Camp Nama. Nor would the department say whether ministers had been made aware of concerns about human rights abuses there. There is no suggestion UK  personnel carried out any abuse but questions have been raised about what ministers knew.","Abuse took place at Camp Nama at Baghdad International Airport .

"The former Navy SEAL who wrote an inside account about the mission that killed Osama bin Laden is facing a criminal investigation for revealing classified information, reports claim. Matthew Bissonnette controversially released No Easy Day in 2012 without approval from the Department of Defense, selling thousands of copies worldwide before it was even published. Now, as he prepares to publish a sequel, his lawyer has revealed a vast proportion of the profits could be soaked up by extensive fines leveled by the Pentagon. Scroll down for video . Probe: Former Navy SEAL Matthew Bissonnette, pictured in 2012, is being investigated by the Department of Defense as he prepares to release another tell-all book. The probe centers on speeches he has made . The latest probe centers on the speeches Bissonnette has made since publishing his tell-all book under the pseudonym Mark Owen, The New York Times revealed. It comes after Bissonnette submitted a draft of his second book - No Hero: The Evolution Of A Navy SEAL - for approval from the Department of Defense, including slides and notes from his speeches. He has already apologized for failing to seek approval for his revelations in No Easy Day, and allegedly agreed to forfeit a portion of his royalties in a dispute settlement. However, another probe has been launched to investigate details disclosed at speeches across the U.S. Last year, he spoke at a golf club in Atlanta where visitors were instructed to deposit their phones at the door and were barred from taking notes. His lawyer Robert D Luskin insists the speeches were not controversial and says he  expects the investigation to be resolved 'favorably'. Bissonnette was disciplined in November 2012 for sharing classified information with the makers of the popular video game Medal of Honor: Warfighter. According to senior Navy officials, Bissonnette recruited his fellow SEALs to spend two days as paid consultants for Electronic Arts. Controversial: He was forced to apologize after publishing No Easy Day without Pentagon approval. The book, written under the pseudonym Mark Owen, was an inside account of the mission that killed Osama bin Laden . It was the investigation the military launched into Bissonnette's book  that led the authorities to discover that he had allegedly 'recruited' the 11 Navy SEALS into the video game deal. His second piece of work is a reaction to the Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty, which consulted former CIA director Leon E Panetta. The narrative conflicted with many elements of Bissonnette's telling, and in his opinion it is the SEALs' story to tell. The news comes as  the SEAL Team 6 member called 'The Shooter' - who fired the kill shot at Bin Laden - prepares to reveal his identity. He fiercely guarded in the aftermath of the May 2011 raid on Bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakisatan compound, fearing the SEAL could be targeted by al-Qaeda as retribution. But he has since retired and is apparently ready to take off his mask of anonymity to detail the events leading up to and during Operation Neptune's Spear. Fears: Officials feared the account of the mission, which the White House watched live (pictured), could reveal key details of U.S. military strategy. Bissonnette was already disciplined for liaising with a video game on it . According to a Fox News press release, the two-part special The Man Who Killed Usama Bin Laden will air Tuesday November 11 and Wednesday November 12 from 10-11pm ET. The interview will be conducted by Washington Correspondent Peter Doocy. 'Revealing his identity and speaking out publicly for the first time, the Navy SEAL, also known as “The Shooter,” will share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden,' the press release states. 'The documentary will provide an extensive, first-hand account of the mission, including the unexpected crash of one of the helicopters that night and why SEAL Team 6 feared for their lives. It will also touch upon what was taking place inside the terrorist compound while President Obama and his cabinet watched from the White House.' It's unclear whether the Shooter's identity will be protected in anyway, or if he will both appear on the camera and reveal his real name.","Matthew Bissonnette published No Easy Day unapproved in 2012 .

"President Obama urged a crowd of black American males on Sunday to stop blaming discrimination for personal failures and to strive to be better fathers and husbands . In a rare and personal commencement address at the historically black, all-male Morehouse College, Obama pointed out that 'too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices.' 'Growing up, I made a few myself,' he said. 'And I have to confess, sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. But one of the things you've learned over the last four years is that there's no longer any room for excuses.' Scroll down for video . President Obama urges Morehouse College grads to take responsibility for their communities . President Barack Obama told graduates to use the opportunities they have been given to help others less fortunate than themselves . With growing competition for jobs and . the globalization of the work force, Obama said, 'nobody is going to . give you anything you haven't earned.' 'Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination,' he added. The president also spoke about the importance of family and what it was like growing up with an absent father. He challenged graduates to 'transform the way we think about manhood.' 'My whole life, I’ve tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my . father wasn’t for my mother and me,' he said. 'I want to break that . cycle - where a father’s not at home, where a father’s not helping to . raise that son and daughter. I want to be a better father, a better . husband, a better man.' Obama's father, Barack Hussein Obama Sr., was a Kenyan governmental economist who divorced the younger Obama's mother within three years of marrying her. They met at the University of Hawaii and married in 1961, the year President Obama was born. By 1964, the elder Obama had returned to his native Kenya. Obama said he was lucky to have his mother and grandparents, who raised him, and said that under different circumstances, he could have ended up in prison or . unemployed. 'I might have been in prison. I might . have been unemployed. I might not . have been able to support a family — and that motivates me,' he said. While he urged graduates to not use race as an . excuse for their failures, he acknowledged that the 'bitter legacy' of discrimination still . exists in America. 'At some point in life as an African American you have to work twice as hard as anyone else if you want to get by,' he said.

"Amanda Knox is 'very anxious' as Italy's supreme court today hears from prosecutors appealing her acquittal of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, her lawyer said. Prosecutors on behalf of the Kercher family say that the acquittals of Knox and her former boyfriend Raffale Sollecito in 2011 should be thrown out and a new trial ordered, calling those verdicts 'contradictory and illogical'. Meredith, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was . found semi-naked with her throat cut and more than 40 wounds on her body in the bedroom of the house she . shared with Knox and two other women in Perugia in . November 2007. Raffaele Sollecito, pictured in 2009, and Amanda Knox will hear if they are to be retried for Meredith's murder . She had arrived in Italy two months earlier to spend a year studying at the University for Foreigners as part of her degree at Leeds University. On the night of her death, she had watched a DVD with three fellow British students before returning to her rented accommodation. '[Knox] is carefully paying attention to . what will come out,' her lawyer Luciano Ghirga said as he arrived at . Italy's Court of Cassation. 'This is a fundamental stage. The trial is very complex.' Ghirga and Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said they were confident the 2011 verdict clearing their clients would be upheld by the court, which will rule only on procedural issues. 'There seems to be very little criticism of the technical aspects of the trial,' said Ghirga. Bongiorno told reporters before the hearing: 'We have a verdict behind us that is so well-grounded, coherent and logical that we're very calm.' Knox and Sollecito were convicted of Miss Kercher's murder in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. They were cleared in October 2011 after a fresh hearing uncovered a bungled police investigation. Defence lawyers and experts revealed how evidence had been contaminated or poorly handled by forensic teams and that the conviction should be considered unsafe. The appeals court noted that the murder weapon was never found, said that DNA tests were faulty and added that Knox and Sollecito had no motive to kill Kercher. Yesterday Meredith’s sister Stephanie . said: ‘There are lots of questions without answers and that’s why we . are looking for the truth. Meredith Kercher had arrived in Italy only two months before she was killed to study at the University for Foreigners . Stephanie Kercher, Meredith's sister, said there were still 'unanswered questions' over her sister's death . ‘We miss Meredith terribly and nothing will bring her back. Diane Sawyer is still preparing for her interview with Amanda Knox for an ABC special, sources confirmed today. The legendary journalist will interview the Seattle student next month to promote her new book. The hour-long, pre-taped interview, will air on April 30 - the same day Knox's book, Waiting To Be Heard, is published. ‘We hope that the supreme court hearing will help to find some answers to what happened that night. ‘Meredith will never be forgotten but . it’s also important not to forget what happened, a beautiful young . girl, my little sister, taken away from us too early in a brutal manner, . with many aspects to still clarify. The court could rule later today . whether Knox, who now lives in Seattle, and Sollecito, who lives in . Bisceglie, southern Italy, will be retried or if the case will be closed . for good. A panel of judges will rule whether the Italian legal code was applied correctly and fairly in both trials. If the case is closed, they could apply for compensation for unlawful imprisonment. The hearing, held behind closed doors, will only consider paperwork and legal documents with no new witnesses giving evidence. Meredith Kercher was found dead in the Perugia cottage she shared with Knox and two Italian students . If the court does order a retrial . Knox would not have to return to Italy as there is no requirement for . defendants to be in court. Knox and Sollecito have both . maintained their innocence, though they said that smoking marijuana the . night Miss Kercher was killed had clouded their recollections. Their behaviour in the days following the death, including being pictured kissing, raised suspicion. Knox is due to be interviewed by ABC next month over her upcoming memoir . Prosecutors have alleged that Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sexual assault. A young drifter from Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, was convicted of the slaying in separate proceedings and is serving a 16-year sentence. Ms Kercher's family have resisted theories that Guede acted alone. The lawyer for the Kercher family, Francesco Maresca, was at the court today, as was Sollecito's father. The court is also hearing Knox's appeal against a slander conviction for having accused Patrick Lumumba, a local pub owner, of carrying out the killing. He was held for two weeks based on her allegations. Knox has written a book about her . imprisonment and is due to give an interview to Diane Sawyer for American TV station ABC . next month ahead of its release. Publisher HarperCollins paid a $4million advance for the memoirs . Sollecito has also written a book and has already given an interview on Italian TV about the case. He told interviewers that he and Knox were no longer a couple but they were still in touch. He visited her in the United States at the end of last year and they speak on Skype regularly. Sollecito resumed his studies in Verona and his father Francesco told reporters: 'He is calm and serene even if we are all in a state of apprehension.' During the investigation and trial, prosecutors said Knox was highly sexual and had manipulated Sollecito but her lawyers dismissed the theory.

"He's the humongous snake who, in the words of his catcher, should sign himself up for Weightwatchers. A Newcastle animal controller yesterday captured the fattest red belly black snake he had ever seen, after he was discovered lurking under an air conditioning unit at a business park in Cameron Park. 'He needs like, Weightwatchers, or something,' Geoff Delooze told Daily Mail Australia. 'Isn't he monstrous?' Scroll down for video . Enormoussssssssssssss! The red-belly black snake typically feasts on frogs, mice - and other snakes. It took Mr Delooze ten minutes to coax the venomous snake out from its adopted home at the WDS Engineering building. The snake weighed slightly less than 10kg and was around two metres long. It's rare for the serpents to grow this long and the snake catcher has never seen one of that weight. 'I've got pythons here and he's bigger than them,' said Mr Delooze, a senior reptile technician at Newcastle and Hunter Animal Control. Even a bird of prey would struggle with a reptile of this size, Mr Delooze said. He said the red belly would have feasted on frogs, mice, and no doubt, other snakes too. 'A hundred per cent (sure),' he said. 'They're cannibalistic, they'll eat whatever they can fit in their mouth.' Mothers often hunt down their own babies after they hatch. Snake sightings typically increase in the warmer months. And there is evidence the 'season' is slithering off to a speedy start. Ssssssssssssssssurprise! This snake burst from a bathroom fitting in Brisbane. 'Omg. That's not even funny': One of many remarks made by startled Facebook users after Snake Catchers Brisbane posted these pictures. A Queensland snake catching company posted these dramatic pictures of a carpet python bursting out of a bathroom light fitting earlier this week. It provoked a frightful response on their Facebook page. 'You'd wanna hope there's a toilet in that bathroom after walking in to see that - it'd be needed LOL,' Nikki Day said. 'Omg. That's not even funny. Our heat light is like that,' another user, Shara Feneck, said.","It's the biggest red belly black snake this reptile expert has ever seen .

"David Cameron has written to the parents of a 10-year-old girl who died from a brain tumour and shared his own pain at losing a child. Paula and David Holmes, of Penwortham, Lancashire, wrote letters to the Prime Minister and Health Secretary following the death of their daughter Katy, urging the Government to put more money into researching the cause of brain tumours. Today, Mrs Holmes spoke of her delight after not only receiving a letter from the Prime Minister but also a handwritten response in which he talked about the pain of losing his son Ivan, who had severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died in 2009 aged six. Shared pain: David and Paula Holmes, from Lancashire, hold the letter from David Cameron, in which he spoke of losing his son Ivan . Loss: Katy, centre, with baby Scarlet and sister Charley, 8, and from left, mother Paula, brother Craig, 19, brother Lee, 24, father David and sister Kelly, 27. She died in January after being diagnosed in October . Mr Cameron wrote: 'I am so sorry to hear of your loss. I miss my Ive every day, but at least I do sometimes now feel happy and not sad when I think of him. The point that you make about causes and medicines is a really powerful one. I will check myself that the research programmes are properly directed.' He adds: 'I know from my own experiences of losing a child how devastating it is and that the pain never truly goes away.' In their letter, the couple urged Mr Cameron to consider their arguments for greater research with his 'Dad head' rather than as PM. The Prime Minister signs off his letter: 'With love and best wishes David Cameron (with my Dad head firmly on!)' Sympathy: David and Samantha Cameron with their son Ivan in 2008 (left) and the day after his death in 2009 . Mrs Holmes, a mother of five, said: 'We are over the moon at getting this reply from David Cameron. We asked him to show us that he cared and by handwriting this letter, he has done exactly that.' Katy died in January at Derian House Children's Hospice, Chorley, after she was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour in October. She had been a healthy and happy child up until a few weeks before her diagnosis, when Mrs Holmes grew worried after her daughter stopped smiling and started complaining of headaches and blurred vision. At the time Mrs Holmes was pregnant with a baby girl, and as the aggressive cancer took hold she began to worry Katy would die before she had a chance to meet her new sister Scarlet. She took the decision to have Scarlet induced three weeks early and, despite the tumour's rapid development, Katy held on long enough to hold her newborn sibling in her arms.","PM's handwritten letter to Paula and David Holmes after they contacted him over loss of daughter Katy, 10 .
