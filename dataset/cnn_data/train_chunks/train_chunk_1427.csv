"Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio (pictured), whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child . A serial crook jailed for stealing £12,000 from a deaf couple who thought he was helping them have children via a surrogate mother in Kenya has been ordered to pay them almost £30,000. Gino Di Caprio, 53, of Rossendale, Lancashire, was ordered to pay more than £14,000 each to Sonia and Neil Musselwhite over the scam which began in June 2011. He must also pay Mr Musselwhite's mother the same amount after conning her and her son out of almost £90,000 by persuading them to invest in bogus property deals in Kenya in a separate scam. Di Caprio told the Musselwhites, who were unable to conceive, that he could arrange for them to have the baby they longed for through his contacts in Kenya. He went with the couple to a fertility clinic in Oxford and pretended to arrange for their eggs and sperm to be sent to the African country, charging them £34 for the carriage. He then took a fee of £6,000 from them for the fabricated surrogacy, before spinning a lie that the child had Down’s Syndrome. He said that the child's condition meant that they would be unable to take it, because of their own disabilities and would also lose their money. A deal for a second baby was reached but DiCaprio extracted more money by saying the child was ill and that there had been visa complications to delay its arrival. He even sent them fake pictures of the baby, called Amy, which he had actually taken from a photographer’s website. Mrs Musselwhite gave up her job in February 2013 to prepare for the child's arrival. Police later discovered this was a picture of Di Caprio's own daughter, called Ellie. After being arrested in September last year, he was jailed for three and a half years in March for four counts of confidence fraud. The scams were said to have left Mr and Mrs Musselwhite emotionally and financially devastated. A hearing to confiscate his assets was due to be held at Reading Crown Court on Friday last week, but did not go ahead because an agreement was made in advance over the amount of money Di Caprio had available to pay back his victims. Di Caprio - who is also deaf - had known Mr and Mrs Musselwhite for almost 20 years and they regarded him as a friend. Mr Musselwhite said DiCaprio attended the Oxford fertility clinic, where he appeared to speak with the receptionist, leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to Kenya . Oscar Del Fabro, prosecuting, told the court on Friday that Di Caprio would have £44,230.59 available to pay back his victims, and that would be split three ways between them. Rebecca Randall, defending, asked for the maximum time to pay because of Di Caprio’s difficulties as a deaf man making the arrangements from prison. Di Caprio was given six months to realise his assets and pay up, with a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment if he fails to do so within the deadline. During his trial in March, the court heard that he had 11 previous convictions for numerous offences dating back to 1982, including theft, forgery and making false statements. He was jailed for eight years in 1992 for robbing a jeweller while armed and for two years in 1999 for attempting to obtain property by deception.","Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted friend of 20 years Gino Di Caprio, 53 .

"He started work as the White House's 'Ebola Czar' in October. But now, Ron Klain is stepping down from the position to return to the private sector, it is reported. The 53-year-old, a former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, will apparently leave his role in the Obama administration by March 1 following a widely-criticized and very short tenure. Instead, he will return to his former job as President of Case Holdings and general counsel for former AOL chief Steve Case's venture firm, Revolution LLC, according to Fortune magazine. Scroll down for video . Stepping down: Ron Klain is stepping down as White House's 'Ebola Czar' to return to the private sector it has been reported. Above, the 53-year-old is pictured speaking at Georgetown University on December 5 . Crisis meeting: Klein (pictured, third right in the back row, two seats along from President Barack Obama, during an Ebola response meeting) will apparently leave his role in the Obama administration by March 1 . 'He has no intention of staying on in any other capacity here at the White House,' an administration official told the magazine. 'Ron will do the job for which he was appointed and return to Revolution.' Klain was tapped by the White House on October 17 to coordinate the federal response to the outbreak of the Ebola, which has so far killed more than 5,000 people, mainly in West Africa. Speaking of Klain's appointment, Mr Case said his employee 'was not eager to take on' the position, but felt it was 'an important thing to do' and understood that 'it would be for a limited period of time'. During his short tenure, Klain was widely condemned for not being visible during the peak of the outbreak of the deadly virus, leaving others, such as President Barack Obama, to face the public. Ex-AOL chief: Klain will return to his job as President of Case Holdings and general counsel for Steve Case's (above) venture firm, Revolution LLC . Indeed, only two weeks out from the midterm elections, the spread of Ebola appeared to be defying official assurances to the American public that the situation  was under control. Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, contracted the disease after treating Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who died from the virus on October 2, revealing the flaws in Ebola protocols. And in subsequent days, Congressional calls for a travel ban from the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to the U.S. only enhanced public concern toward the outbreak. Then in late October, Dr Craig Spencer made national headlines after he rode the subway, visited a Manhattan restaruant and went bowling in Brooklyn while infected with Ebola. Dr Spencer, 33, was declared virus-free and released from New York's Bellevue Hospital on November 11 following 20 days in isolation. However, while he was in hospital, poll results released by CNN revealed that many Americans felt that Klain was not doing a 'good job' to reassure the public about the Ebola outbreak. Klain was conspicuously absent from several conference calls and meetings, while Conservatives were questioning his credentials - particularly the fact that he had never handled a health crisis before. In defense, the president's spokesman claimed that Klain's position was a managerial one, and his sole responsibility was 'coordinating the whole-of-government approach.' 'He has performed very well in that task,' press secretary Josh Earnest said, adding that the fruits of his labor are 'already being felt, at the White House and across the government'. On November 17, Dr Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola in his native Sierra Leone. died in a Nebraska hospital, bringing the U.S. death toll from the virus to two. But in recent weeks, no new cases have emerged and Ebola has largely faded from the public eye. Tragic: During his short tenure, Klain was widely condemned for not being visible during the peak of the outbreak of the virus.

Cleared: Nurses Nina Pham (right), 26, and Amber Vinson (left), 29, contracted the disease after treating Mr Duncan, revealing the flaws in Ebola protocols. Both of the nurses have now been cleared of Ebola . Last week, the White House issued a progress report, saying that, under Klain’s leadership, 32 new treatment facilities were designated to deal with Ebola, according to the New York Daily News. Twenty-nine laboratories were also newly equipped to test for the disease, while increased screening measures at U.S. airports were put into place, the report said. And on Sunday, the New York State Department of Health said that there were currently no cases of Ebola in the state. 'Protecting the well-being of New Yorkers is the State’s top priority,' Governor Andrew Cuomo said. 'And we are continuing to exercise an abundance of caution when it comes to dealing with Ebola.' Fading from public view: In recent weeks, no new Ebola cases have emerged and the virus has largely faded from the public eye. Above, health workers clean out Mr Duncan's apartment in Dallas, Texas, in October . Rumors: There was speculation that Klein would stay on in the White House in another role, potentially as Counselor to the President if John Podesta (pictured) quit to run a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign . Klain's role as 'special government employee' was always meant to be temporary, according to Fortune, with such short-termers typically expected to stay on the job no longer than 130 days.

"After a spectacular four-day wedding celebration, they were hardly going to settle into married life in anything less than the lap of luxury. Fresh from their honeymoon, George Clooney and his British wife Amal Alamuddin have reportedly splashed out £10million on a stunning Grade II-listed manor house in Berkshire. The elegant nine-bedroom Georgian mansion alongside the Thames affords the pair unrivalled privacy and luxury.

And for high-flying human rights lawyer Miss Alamuddin, 36, it has the advantage of easy access to London. The couple’s near–neighbours will include illusionist Uri Geller and Home Secretary Theresa May. Clooney is thought to have become interested in the area after visiting the nearby Buckinghamshire village of Fingest while shooting scenes for his film The Monuments Men. The ivy-covered property boasts a suite of elegant reception rooms with high ceilings, book-lined walls, chandeliers and open fireplaces. The grand dining room inside the house believe to be the new home of Mr and Mrs Clooney, complete with traditional wood fireplace . If the couple need live-in staff or a gardener to maintain the perfectly manicured lawns, they will be able to house them in a separate cottage in the immaculate grounds. The house was bought at the end of last month through a privately held company. Clooney and Miss Alamuddin married in Venice last month, but they are said to have honeymooned in the local area. Last weekend they were spotted at a 500-year-old pub near their new home, setting tongues wagging.

"Five students at New Jersey's William Paterson University pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges they restrained and sexually assaulted a female student in a dorm. The five are charged with crimes including conspiracy, criminal restraint and aggravated sexual assault. The alleged attack occurred November 25 on the campus in Wayne. Jahmel Latimer of Hoboken, Darius Singleton of Jersey City, Garret Collick of Paterson, Noah Williams of Camden and Tremaine Scott of Vineland pleaded not guilty through their attorneys at a brief proceeding Tuesday. Scott was delayed until his attorney arrived.

Charged: All the suspects, including Jahmel Latimer (right) and Garret Collick (left) are face charges that include conspiracy, criminal restraint and aggravated sexual assault . Five were arraigned: Noah Williams, left, enters the courtroom with his attorney Judy Fallon before his arraignment . Bail was lowered from $200,000 to $50,000 by the Passaic County prosecutor's office. The five were being held at the county jail and appeared in court in prison uniforms. The female student reported last week that she was attacked in a dorm room at William Paterson University and then held against her will. According to the criminal complaint, the five men turned out the lights and used 'physical force or coercion' to attack the victim at the Overlook South residence hall. They then forced her to perform multiple sex acts before they stopped her from leaving the room. Court documents show that the five men arrested were Noah Williams, Garrett Collick , Termaine Scott, Jahmel Latimer and Darius Singleton, who all studied at the University. The men, who are all 18, are facing a range of charges from kidnapping to aggravated criminal sexual contact, and bail has been set at $200,000 for each suspect. According to the Record, which obtained the complaint to police, Latimer is accused of pulling the woman by the hair and forcing her to perform sex acts. The other four men are alleged to have conspired to commit sexual assault, restrained another person unlawfully and exposed them to risk of serious bodily injury. The school's president Kathleen Waldron confirmed that all five of the accused lived at the university and have been 'barred from campus'. In a statement she added: 'My deepest concern is for the victim of this criminal act who has courageously stepped forward to take legal action and seek justice. Barred: The school's president Kathleen Waldron confirmed that all five of the accused lived at the university and have been 'barred from campus' The men, who are all 18, are facing a range of charges from kidnapping to aggravated criminal sexual contact, and bail has been set at $200,000 for each suspect . Locals: The university in Wayne, New Jersey has a student population of around 11,500. The suspects come from the nearby cities of Jersey City, Camden, Paterson and Vineland . 'No expression of anger or sadness on my part can alleviate the harm done to the victim and my heart goes out to her and her family.' The case comes just weeks after an article in Rolling Stone magazine described an alleged gang rape on campus at a fraternity house at the University of Virginia. The article detailed the alleged sexual assault of a freshman woman by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012. The university, in Charlottesville, has suspended all activities of its fraternities, sororities and related groups until January 9 to address sexual violence and assault. Police are investigating and Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said he would be appointing an independent counsel to review the school's sexual violence policies.

"Swathes of Twitter users have expressed annoyance at the roll-out of an experimental new feature. Users of the social network have reported seeing tweets favourited by other people in their own timeline. In addition to this, some members have complained that their feed shows tweets alerting them that an account they follow has followed a new account. Unhappy: Some Twitter users are seeing tweets favourited by other people in their timeline, as well as who they have recently followed. Many people are unhappy with the experiment and are making their views known. Peter Kafka, a journalist at Recode is among users who are seeing the changes (tweet above) Currently, only retweets posted by accounts that someone has personally chosen to follow show up on timelines, as well as advertisements, The Next Web reports. Members have voiced their anger over the ‘experiment’, with many explaining that they were never given the option to opt out of sharing content they had marked as a 'favourite' with their followers. One user said: 'I really, REALLY hate all these new Twitter things',while another vented: 'If I wanted to see what my friends favourite, I could look. I neither want nor need it added to my timeline.' Pictured above is a screenshot taken by Peter Kafka showing notifications of that someone has favourited content and followed accounts on Twitter . The 'favourite' function can be used in a number of ways - it can be employed as a way of acknowledging a tweet and saying thank you, or as a way of saving a message so it is easy to access at a later date. Until now, the action of favouriting a message was more 'private' that retweeting it to followers. Many people have expressed that they simply don’t understand the point of the tweak, arguing that it makes favouriting a tweet the same as retweeting it. The experiment is thought to have been taking place for around a month and commentators say it is unlikely to roll out in its current form. It is currently unclear how many users are seeing the change in their timeline and are sharing their 'favourite' tweets whether they want to or not. MailOnline asked Twitter whether it plans to extend the reach of the experiment and was directed to a blog post about the company's experiments written last year. The blog post, says: ‘We’ve tested various features with small groups of our 200 million users before determining what we’ll release. These tests are essential to delivering the best possible user experience. ‘We also experiment with features that may never be released to everyone who uses Twitter. Those experiments are perhaps even more valuable because they help us decide what not to do - which is important as we work to keep Twitter simple while improving the user experience. ‘Ultimately, our goal is to learn and keep making the product better; we aren’t necessarily looking to launch all of the experiments we roll out.’ Twitter has now updated its help page to shed light on timeline changes. It reads: 'When we identify a Tweet, an account to follow, or other content that's popular or relevant, we may add it to your timeline. 'This means you will sometimes see Tweets from accounts you don't follow. We select each Tweet using a variety of signals, including how popular it is and how people in your network are interacting with it. Our goal is to make your home timeline even more relevant and interesting.' Some people who have been affected by the experimental changes are unhappy (such as the twitter user above) although it is not known if the changes will be rolled out widely . Twitter users such as Nils (above) may hope that the experiment will be encourage Twitter to largely stay the same and help it decide 'what not to do'. The company says  in a blog post that it has used experiments to decide upon future features before . Twitter has been leapfrogged by Snapchat, which is not the third most used social media app. Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds now use the self-destructing messaging app, compared to 24 per cent who use Twitter . As well as news of an unpoular experiment, last week it was reported that Twitter has been leapfrogged by Snapchat to become the third most used social media app. Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds now use the self-destructing messaging app, which is more than double the amount of users the company had in November. Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent. Snapchat's popularity is also growing among 25 to 34-year-olds, and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the the younger age group. The figures were taken from comScore’s June Mobile Metrix report. Vine is used by 10.7 per cent of millennials, and Pinterest is just above on 17.9 per cent. Google sits in fifth on 18 per cent. comScore's vice president, marketing and insights, Andrew Lipsman wrote: 'Long term success in the social media sector is no given. 'Achieving critical mass is an important step in eventually reaching the winner’s circle, and with Snapchat it would appear to be right in that sweet spot. 'If usage begins to accelerate significantly from this point forward, who knows how big it can eventually get?' Last year, Snapchat turned down a $3 billion (£1.8 billion) acquisition bid from Facebook.","Some user of the social network are seeing tweets favourited by other people in their timeline as well as who they have started following .

"England boss Stuart Lancaster will be taking a huge selection gamble if he opts to fill his problem centre-pairing with Bath’s Kyle Eastmond for the forthcoming autumn internationals, admits World Cup winner Lewis Moody. While the majority of his starting XV all but picks itself, Lancaster continues to roll the dice at 12 and 13, with a combination of injuries and erratic form seeing a number of options fill the England centre roles. In the last 12 months Lancaster has handed starts to Eastmond, Billy Twelvetrees, Joel Tomkins, Brad Barritt, Luther Burrell and Manu Tuilagi and still he seems uncertain of his premier midfield combination. England head coach Stuart Lanacaster (centre) issues instructions to his players during training . England backs coach Andy Farrell (centre) is surrounded by a huddle as he talks to the squad . Bath's Kyle Eastmond (front) celebrates scoring a try against Saracens earlier this month . A groin injury will see Leicester Tiger Tuilagi miss the autumn Tests, while Northampton Saint Burrell is also struggling with injury, meaning Eastmond is now in pole position to stake his claim. The Bath man has started the season in impressive form but during the summer tour to New Zealand his defensive work was questioned, particularly in the third Test against the All Blacks that saw him hauled off at half-time. There’s no doubting Eastmond’s class with ball in hand or his ability to make yards in attack but Moody admits there are serious questions marks that need erasing from his defensive game. 'One of Stuart Lancaster’s main worries is around that centre pairing because obviously his potential first-choice centre partnership (Tuilagi and Burrell) is banged up,' said Moody, speaking at the launch of this year’s LV= Cup at Northampton’s Franklins Gardens. 'Does he go with Eastmond who can be absolutely devastating in attack but who was fundamentally found out in defence on the summer tour? Henry Slade (centre) runs with the ball during the England training session at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday . England's Marland Yarde (left) and Semesa Rokoduguni (second left) arrive for training . 'I’ve seen him play at Bath and it’s an area of his game that he has worked on. He was more disappointed than anyone else over the summer and it’s about fitting into the team and getting used to playing at the highest level. 'Kyle is a Jason Robinson-style player, so I think he should be paired with someone like Billy Twelvetrees who is solid and steady or Brad Barritt who is even more solid and steady. 'It’s a tricky one for Stuart and there is also someone like Jonathan Joseph pushing for game-time, but there are some good conundrums for him.' England World Cup winning coach Sir Clive Woodward has called on Saracens’ playmaker Owen Farrell – Lancaster’s current first choice fly-half – to be given an extended run in the No.12 jersey. It seems unlikely Lancaster will move Farrell though this autumn, meaning one of Barritt or Twelvetrees will likely start in the autumn. Moody admits he can see the sense in opting for a tried and trusted approach of Barritt or Twelvetrees in midfield but insists neither are the long-term solution to Lancaster’s centre conundrum. He added: 'Billy really controls a game well and he’s taken his chances in an England shirt, so I think he deserves to be in the squad. England's Owen Farrell catches the ball as the squad prepare for the autumn internationals . England World Cup winner Lewis Moody pictured at the launch of the 2014-15 LV=Cup in Guildford .

"New Yorker's have ants and other insects to thank for some of Manhattan's messiest garbage disposal, researchers have found. The discovered that insects on a single stretch of road consumed more than 2,100 pounds of discarded junk food, the equivalent of 60,000 hot dogs. They say the study shows just how important insects are to cities. The team discovered that on one stretch of Broadway insects  consumed more than 2,100 pounds of discarded junk food, the equivalent of 60,000 hot dogs. To see how much the arthropods ate, the researchers put out carefully measured amounts of junk food - potato chips, cookies and hot dogs - at sites in street medians and city parks. Researchers placed two sets of food at each site. One set was placed in a cage, so only arthropods could reach the food; the second set was placed in the open, where other animals could also eat it. After 24 hours, the scientists collected the food to see how much was eaten. The new study from North Carolina State University shows that arthropods - ants, millipedes, mites, spiders and others -  play a significant role in disposing of garbage on the streets of Manhattan. 'We calculate that the arthropods on medians down the Broadway/West St. corridor alone could consume more than 2,100 pounds of discarded junk food, the equivalent of 60,000 hot dogs, every year - assuming they take a break in the winter,' says Dr. Elsa Youngsteadt, a research associate at NC State and lead author of a paper on the work. 'This isn't just a silly fact,' Youngsteadt explains. 'This highlights a very real service that these arthropods provide. 'They effectively dispose of our trash for us.' During the summer of 2013, the researchers working in parks and on streets in Manhattan measured temperature and humidity and sampled the population of arthropods. They also sifted through the leaf litter and sucked ants into an aspirator by hand. They extracted 16,294 bugs, including representatives of 32 species of ants. To see how much the arthropods ate, the researchers put out carefully measured amounts of junk food - potato chips, cookies and hot dogs - at sites in street medians and city parks. Researchers placed two sets of food at each site. One set was placed in a cage, so only arthropods could reach the food; the second set was placed in the open, where other animals could also eat it. After 24 hours, the scientists collected the food to see how much was eaten. The researchers were in the midst of a long-term study of urban insects when Hurricane Sandy struck NYC in 2012. In spring 2013, they expanded their study to look at whether Sandy had affected the behaviour of these insect populations. To see how much the arthropods ate, the researchers put out carefully measured amounts of junk food - potato chips, cookies and hot dogs - at sites in street medians and city parks. The researchers found that Hurricane Sandy had no measurable impact on food consumption by arthropod populations in New York, which was somewhat surprising since many of the study sites had been flooded with brackish water. The bigger surprise was that arthropod populations in medians ate two to three times more junk food than those in parks - even though there was less biodiversity in the medians. 'We think this is because one of the most common species in the medians was the pavement ant (Tetramorium species), which is a particularly efficient forager in urban environments,' Youngsteadt says. In addition, by comparing food consumption inside and outside of the sample cages, the researchers showed that other animals - such as rats and pigeons - were also eating the junk food. 'This means that ants and rats are competing to eat human garbage, and whatever the ants eat isn't available for the rats,' Youngsteadt explains. 'The ants aren't just helping to clean up our cities, but to limit populations of rats and other pests.'","Researchers studied the Broadway/West St. corridor in Manhattan .

"A man who allegedly kicked a mother down onto a Bronx sidewalk with her two-month-old son last week before snatching her cellphone has been apprehended. Alonzo Brown was arrested while at his uncle's home on Tuesday morning, WABC reported. The NYPD earlier released the 18-year-old's mugshot in a bid to catch him. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Alonzo Brown was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly kicking a woman down onto a sidewalk with her young son last week . Targeted: The CCTV footage shows a man walking along a Bronx sidewalk behind Odila Orozco, who is carrying her son Jordy . Attack: He then approaches the Orozco from behind and kicks her in the back . Brown apologized to both the female victim and the baby - identified by WABC as Odila Orozco and her son Jordy -  while speaking to the affiliate station. He said he discovered the baby 'When [the woman] hit the floor.' Brown has been charged with robbery, attempted robbery, assault, and act in a manner injurious to a child, WABC reported. The infant was fastened on the 24-year-old victim's person when Brown rushed up in back of her before striking with his leg, police told WPIX. The victim dropped onto the sidewalk while the 18-year-old allegedly picked up her phone and fled. Orozco told WABC she rejected Brown's apology. At the beginning of surveillance footage, released by the NYPD, a man is seen looking around. He then spots Orozco and begins following her. As he approaches he lifts up his coat and then starts running at her before delivering a kick. The clip shows Orozco then sprawled on the floor with a handbag to her side. The man is then seen bending down to pick up the phone before fleeing. As a result of the blow, Orozco landed with her weight on the child. The pair were taken to hospital but have been released and are expected to be fine, WPIX reported. Charged: Alonzo Brown, seen Tuesday, has been charged with both robbery and assault .

"Plans are underway to make the biggest heavyweight fight on British soil since Frank Bruno fought Lennox Lewis, with Anthony Joshua’s camp hopeful of delivering a domestic blockbuster against Tyson Fury next summer. Much will depend on whether Wladimir Klitschko honours Fury’s status as mandatory challenger for his WBO title. But with Fury admitting significant doubts that the Ukrainian great will meet him next summer, Sportsmail has been told Joshua’s team are now actively considering the possibility of a fight that would pose an enormous challenge in what has so far been a devastating surge through the professional ranks. Anthony Joshua (left) is hoping to take on Tyson Fury in summer 2015 in what will be his biggest test yet . Fury (right) demolished Dereck Chisora (left) at the weekend and has his sights set on world titles . Joshua v Fury would be an all-English blockbuster with both unbeaten in 10 and 23 fights respectively . Age: 25 (Watford) Fights: 10 Wins: 10 . Losses: 0 KOs: 10 . Age: 26 (Manchester) Fights: 23 Wins: 23 . Losses: 0 KOs: 17 . Whatever reservations there might have been over Joshua’s readiness for a dangerous opponent such as Fury seem to have all but disappeared, with both men extending their unbeaten records to 10 and 23 fights respectively in the past fortnight. Joshua, 25, will on Wednesday hold a press conference to discuss his January 31 fight with America’s Kevin Johnson at London’s 02 Arena – a bout first revealed by Sportsmail in October. A huge match-up with one of the most divisive figures in the sport would then possibly take place at the O2 in London, with each man certain to land the biggest paydays of their careers to date. Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, wrote in his MailOnline column: ‘Tyson Fury is on the horizon for next summer. 'We are moving towards the inevitable, which is a fight with Fury and the other top domestic fighters. It's going to be great times for British boxing. 'I watched the main event from the show at the ExCel at the weekend and I have to say Fury-Dereck Chisora (which Fury won when Chisora retired at the end of the 10th) was one of the dullest heavyweight fights I have seen. Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn says a Fury bout for the young heavyweight is inevitable . 'Fury is a great character and a quality fighter but do you really see him coping with Anthony’s power, speed and work rate? Do you not think Anthony would have blasted Chisora out of there far earlier? 'People ask if AJ is ready to fight Fury but, to be honest, is Fury ready to fight AJ? I believe this is a fight that will bring both men to new levels in terms of financial rewards. It's a numbers game and these numbers add up.' Klitschko remains a significant obstacle to the fight, with the 38-year-old expected to defend his WBO, WBA and IBF belts in March. He would then have four months to fight Fury, 26, whose convincing yet unspectacular dismantling on Chisora made him the mandatory challenger for the WBO strap. Fury is convinced Klistchko will sidestep him before retiring, saying: ‘I believe he’s got one or two more fights. I don’t believe he’s going to fight me. ‘He will fight some American and he will probably try to get the unification fight with (WBC champion) Bermane Stiverne. ‘He will probably beat Stiverne and then retire as a great, great champion. If he does that, good luck to him. If he doesn’t, I’m here. Fury's win came after Chisora retired at the end of the 10th round at the Excel in London . Joshua (left) batters Michael Sprott at Liverpool's Echo Arena on his way to a first round win in November . ‘He’s made around 20 title defences - he’s ruled the division for a long time. It’s time for new blood in the division and that new blood is me.’ That much is open to debate, such has been Joshua’s rapid and dramatic rise since turning professional after winning gold in the London Olympics. Only one of Joshua’s 10 fights to date has reached the third round, with faded former European champion Michael Sprott demolished within two minutes in his last outing on November 22. Johnson will surely provide more of a test, having gone the distance with Vitali Klitschko, Fury and Chisora. There is then the possibility of a final fight before he steps in with Fury in what would be one of the most anticipated match-ups in British boxing’s recent history. Fury used his Twitter account in October to challenge Joshua to meet him in the ring, with the giant Mancunian desperate to fight more regularly after missing out on a £5million payday when David Haye pulled out of their scheduled fight last year.","Anthony Joshua's camp is hoping to make fight against Tyson Fury .

"A retired Canadian Mountie admitted in court Thursday to killing his wife over a Ninetendo Wii game bet. Keith Wiens, who has been charged with second degree murder in the 2011 killing of his common law wife Lynn Kalmring, said in court in British Columbia that he only killed her because he feared for his life. On August 11, 2011 - the night that Kalmring died - the two had played a Ninetendo Wii video game after drinking alcohol and eating dinner. Dangerous games: Wiens, left, killed his wife Kalmring, right, after he refused to fulfill the terms of a bet hedged during a Wii game . Wiens said they usually waged bets of a sexual nature, and that Kalmring had won the game that night. Bet: Apparently the deadly fight started over a risque game of Wii . Later, when he went to bed, Wiens found sex toys scattered across his pillow. Wiens, who wanted to get rest before a golf game the next day, pushed the toys aside and tried to go to sleep. That's when Kalmring became upset. Wiens said that she confronted him multiple times and then suggested that he didn't want to have sex because he wasn't attracted to her and that he wanted to go to work in Grand Prairie to get out of their relationship. 'I said ""No, it's nothing to do with that. I love you. I just need to get some sleep,""' Wiens said. He went back to rest, but Kalmring wouldn't give up. He told her to go sleep in the spare room and thought that worked until he was woken up later by Kalmring hitting him. Something had changed, Wiens noticed. And he began to fear for his life. 'She was not Lynn. She was crazy and she'd just assaulted me when I was sound asleep, and I was worried about what was coming next,' he recalled. So he pulled out the handgun he kept in his bedside table for protection. When Kalmring burst through the bedroom again, this time with a knife, Wiens shot her once in the head. He then says that he put his gun back in his holster and went to throw up in the bathroom. He called 911, got dressed and waited for police outside. Shot dead: Wiens said Kalmring came at him with a knife, and that's why he shot her . According to Wiens, this was the first fight that the couple ever had. But the prosecution and experts found faults in Wiens testimony. First of all, it wasn't the first fight. Crown counselor Colin Forsyth pointed out that they had been in an argument before when Wiens stopped Kalmring from breaking into Willie Nelson's dressing room at a concert and flashing her breasts. 'That's the only time we had a disagreement with each other,' Wiens said. A forensic pathologist also found it strange that Kalmring was found with the knife in her hand. If she was shot she would have dropped the knife, or if she grasped it as she fell to the floor, it wouldn't have been easy to pry from her hands. 'I didn't touch Lynn in anyway, shape or form,' Wiens responded. The trial continues Monday.","Keith Wiens and wife Lynn Kalmring had hedged a bet over a Wii game .

"Standing in the arrivals lounge of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport this is the moment Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan unwittingly brought the deadly virus to the USA. Pictured moments after he completed his journey from disease-ravaged Liberia, two weeks ago, the 42-year-old smiles, as he is greeted warmly by relatives. Holding a family member close he calls others on his cell phone to tell them he will shortly be arriving at their home in Dallas. It follows a journey he was only able to make after he allegedly lied on an airport questionnaire in Liberia about not having any contact with a person infected with the deadly disease. Scroll down for video . Arrival: Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, 42 greets a woman and phones his family after landing at Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport on September 20th . Dressed in a traditional African costume and with her hair-styled especially for the happy occasion the relative appears pleased to see him. Looking healthy Mr Duncan shows no signs of the potentially fatal Ebola virus that struck him down just days after he arrived in the USA. Today the 42-year-old is fighting for his life at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas after doctors confirmed his medical condition had dramatically altered from serious to critical. Texas Health Resources, which runs the hospital, said in a statement: 'Mr Duncan is in a critical condition.' However the relative – who MailOnline have decided not to name – appears to have initially been in denial about the risk to her health after her extended family and friends contacted her following Mr Duncan's hospital admission last week. A friend told MailOnline: 'She is the one who went to pick Thomas Eric Duncan up from the airport. 'They greeted each other, they hugged and held each other, which is only normal. They were pleased to see each other. 'But now everyone has been asking her about what has happened. 'And she has replied; ""my Daddy does not have Ebola."" 'She said; ""Everyone should stop calling me because my dad does not have Ebola."" Document: A photo shows a copy of a passenger health screening form filled out by Thomas Eric Duncan and handed to the Liberian Airport Authority. Officials in the country say they plan to prosecute him . The relative was urged to undergo medical tests to see if she had become infected by the virus. But she appeared to be reluctant to do so. The friend told MailOnline: 'She was meant to go for a medical check-up because she was one of the people who had been with him [Thomas Duncan], but she did not.' It is unclear whether the relative – who is in a stable relationship and has three young children – has since been to see a doctor. Mr Duncan arrived in Texas on September 20th after passing through two of the busiest airports in the USA - at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and Dulles International Airport in Washington DC. The Liberian national had earlier passed through Brussels International in Belgium on a flight from the African state's capital Monrovia. Authorities have claimed he posed no danger to his fellow travelers or anyone who later boarded those planes because he was not displacing any symptoms of the Ebola virus at the time and was therefore not contagious. Home: After leaving the airport, the 42-year-old went to this apartment in Dallas where he stayed with four members of his family. Hazmat teams decontaminated the area a week after he was diagnosed with Ebola . However the 42-year-old helped to carry pregnant daughter of a neighbour who was dying of Ebola prior to the journey. Mr Duncan had come to Dallas to marry the mother of his estranged son, Louise Troh, which would have paved the way for him to stay in the USA permanently, it has emerged. Mark Wingfield, pastor at the Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas, where Ms Troh worships, told MailOnline: 'Louise told our senior pastor on Thursday. The 42-year-old, who is understood to have arrived in the USA on a tourist visa, met Ms Troh in Liberia many years ago, according to Wilshire Baptist church pastor George Mason. He said: 'They had this child. They had a falling out, and she came to the [United] States.' The child, Kasiah Duncan, also came to the USA and this week said he had not seen his father since he was aged three. He is a 19-year-old college student at Angelo State University in San Angelo. Relocated: Two of Duncan's relatives who were quarantined inside the apartment are seen leaving and being moved to another, undisclosed location . Mr Mason added: 'The son hasn't really seen his father for many years. 'I think [Duncan] was seeking reconciliation and hoping they might marry.' Ms Troh visited the Liberian capital Monrovia, where Mr Duncan was living, in August this year, according to her Facebook page. Louise Troh's ex-husband Joe Joe Jallah, who met Mr Duncan before he was admitted to hospital, told the Wall Street Journal, that he believed this was his first trip to the USA. Mr Duncan arrived in Texas on September 20. He began showing symptoms of Ebola three days after his arrival and was admitted to Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday. Texas health officials have said about 100 people may have come into contact with Mr Duncan. And today they announced nine family members and health-care workers had had direct exposure to the Ebola patient and that none has had any symptoms of the disease. Separately, five public school children who had possibly been exposed to the Ebola patient had been kept home from class in recent days while being monitored as a precaution, though none had shown any symptoms, said Mike Miles, superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District. Fears: Officers hand out facemasks at Newark Liberty Airport today, where it was feared a passenger had Ebola. It later turned out he did not . Ebola scare cases are sweeping the nation, with more than 100 potential victims reported to authorities by hospitals in the last few days. Health workers are on high alert for anybody with links to West Africa - where the disease has killed thousands - who show Ebola-like symptoms, which include vomiting, bleeding and diarrhea. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has been deluged by reports of potential sufferers - but so far none have turned out to be genuine Ebola victims. Today Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the rush of potential cases came after news of Duncan's infection spread to hospitals, who have been especially vigilant. The first Ebola diagnosis in the United States 'has really increased attention to what health workers need to do to be alert and make sure a travel history is taken,' Frieden told a news conference. Quarantined: Thomas Eric Duncan is being treated in isolation in Texas Presbyterian in Dallas . Frieden added that many of the inquiries involved people who had not traveled from West Africa, but that the agency preferred healthcare workers to cast as wide a net as possible. Today hazmat crews and disease control officials swooped on a plane this afternoon amid Ebola fears prompted by a Liberian man who started vomiting on a flight to Newark Liberty airport. Passengers were held for hours as the man - thought to be 35 - and his young daughter were rushed off the plane to hospital. Doctors later confirmed that neither of them has the deadly virus. Hospital authorities said the man, believed to be around 35, instead has an unrelated disease which is easily treatable. His daughter, believed to be 10, was also taken to hospital amid fears she was carrying the fatal virus. But she showed no symptoms of any illness at all, doctors said. The governments of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are struggling to contain the worst outbreak on record of the deadly hemorrhagic fever. The World Health Organization on Friday updated its death toll to at least 3,439 out of 7,492 suspected, probable or confirmed cases. Red Cross workers carry away the body of a person suspected of dying from the Ebola virus, in the Liberian capital Monrovia. The death toll in West Africa was updated to 3,439 on Friday .","Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, is pictured arriving at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport .

"Rio Ferdinand was banned for three matches and fined £25,000 after failing to respond to an FA charge of misconduct regarding an abusive tweet. The Queens Park Rangers defender had reacted to online provocation by using the word ‘sket’ in a post about the person’s mother. Sket is a Caribbean word meaning a whore or a promiscuous girl or woman. Failure to admit the charge may have counted against the 35-year-old, who recently served on FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England commission. The tweet may also have been considered a second offence, given it is only two years since Ferdinand was fined £45,000 for referring to Ashley Cole as a ‘choc ice’. Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has been given a three-game suspension by the FA . Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' VIDEO Ferdinand banned for Twitter taunt . According to various dictionaries, 'sket' is a Caribbean term for a whore, and the FA received a number of complaints from members of the public. Ferdinand failed to respond to the initial charge on October 14, something which is believed to have contributed to the length of the ban imposed by the FA. He is understood to be unhappy about the severity of the punishment given that his legal representatives did communicate with the FA over the issue. Ferdinand posted the offending tweet on September 1 and Sportsmail understands the FA received a letter from London law firm Mishcon de Reya on September 10. The letter stated that they did not believe their client had committed an offence but did stress he would be more careful with his comments on social media. The defender, pictured here playing for QPR against West Ham United, has until October 21 to respond . Why Ferdinand did not then respond to the FA’s charge is for him to explain. But it may have been fuelled by a sense that there is a lack of consistency with these cases. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore faced no action from the FA earlier this year over a series of emails that contained sexist comments, and the FA have yet to charge Malky Mackay and Iain Moody over an exchange of emails and tweets that contained sexist as well as racist and homophobic remarks. The FA would no doubt point to the difference between private correspondence and comments made on social media. But the law would not see a distinction, particularly once private communications are made public. Ferdinand was considering an appeal on Wednesday night. But if he accepts the punishment he will miss three matches with immediate effect and have to attend an education programme. An FA statement said they considered Ferdinand’s to be an aggravated offence because his tweet included a reference to gender. A statement on the FA website said: 'Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has been suspended for three matches commencing with immediate effect, subject to any appeal, after an FA misconduct charge against him was found proven. Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets . 'It was alleged a comment Ferdinand posted on his twitter account was abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper. 'It was further alleged that this breach was aggravated pursuant to FA Rule E3(2) as the comment included a reference to gender. 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing on Wednesday 29 October, Ferdinand was also fined £25,000, severely warned as to his future conduct and ordered to attend an education programme, arranged by The FA within four months.' But this is becoming a complex area for the FA when Ferdinand will be only too aware that in recent months the governing body took no action against either Premier League chief executive Scudamore or FA referees chief David Elleray over discrimination issues. Ferdinand (right) is alleged to have 'included a reference to gender' and has been charged with misconduct . The FA have charged Ferdinand, despite the fact that he has been a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke's England commission. He was even linked recently with the post of FIFA vice-president. Ferdinand's profile is huge. He has 5.9million Twitter followers and embraces social media to such an extent that he launched a chapter of his new book on Facebook. He is also an ambassador for BT Sport — indeed he was involved in a BT Sport event with presenter Jake Humphrey in London on Tuesday night — and has worked as a pundit for the BBC. Both BT Sport and the BBC declined to comment, but a tweet from Gary Lineker was fairly representative of the wider response. The Match of the Day presenter said: 'Thanks to @rioferdy5 I've just learnt a new word. The most surprising aspect of his charge is that the FA knew what a 'sket' was.'","Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand charged with misconduct .

"Jonathan Agnew has quit Twitter after the fallout from the Kevin Pietersen row and an argument with the cricket star's wife. The 54-year-old got into a heated debate with  Jessica Taylor on the social media site, leading to him receiving a torrent of abuse. The Test Match Special pundit then deleted his account.

The former Leicestershire bowler spoke on Tuesday on Test Match Special about Pietersen's recent behaviour and the fallout from his controversial new book, while the South African born batsmen listened in from a BBC studio. Aggers suggested that while the 34-year-old pretended to be a strong, confident individual he was in fact 'an anxious, nervous character.' He then spoke about the infamous parody Twitter account @KPGenius, which a number of England players were said to be involved in. Following the incident, Agnew and Taylor argued on Twitter about whether the account was in fact run by Pietersen's team-mates with the former eventually telling the Liberty X singer to 'lose the attitude'. Taylor said: 'I'm not fighting anyone's battles. As a wife and mother I have every right to defend my family when I see fit. I make no apologies for that.'

"Clubs in the Sky Bet Championship have agreed new Financial Fair Play rules in line with those currently used by the Premier League. The regulations, which come into force at the start of the 2016-17 campaign, will see clubs have their financial performance monitored over three seasons rather than one, the same time frame as top-flight clubs. The current maximum permitted loss of £8million per season has been increased to an aggregate of £39million over the three seasons before a club would face sanctions. Clubs in the Championship have agreed to new Financial Fair Play rules . In the meantime the existing Championship FFP framework will remain in place for the current season and next term, while any punishments due for breaching the rules for last season will still be imposed in December. The new set of rules, agreed at an EGM at Derby's iPro Stadium on Thursday morning, will in future be known as the 'Profitability and Sustainability' regulations. Meanwhile, a vote between clubs in Leagues One and Two over the introduction of artificial pitches was tied, meaning the proposals have not been approved. The regulations will see clubs have their financial performance monitored over three seasons rather than one . In what the League called an 'unprecedented' result, 34 clubs voted in favour and 34 against, with four abstentions. Football League chief executive, Shaun Harvey, said: 'This vote is reflective of the fact that this issue divides opinion amongst clubs as much as it does across the football public. 'While the outcome is different to previous indicative votes, it demonstrates that there is still a desire amongst clubs to find out more about artificial playing surfaces before taking such a significant step.'","Championship clubs agree to Premier League style FFP rules .

"A jobless father is demanding a bigger home after he and his wife had seven children in a council house with just two bedrooms. David Stewart, 38, and his wife Lisa, 29, whose youngsters are all under seven, claim the cramped conditions are unhealthy for their young family. Solomon, six, Clementine, five, Donald, four, Katy-Anne, three, twins Joshua and Sophie, two, and three-month-old baby April are 'crammed in like sardines' and making them depressed, Mr Stewart says. Their home has three bedrooms, but one is filled with furniture bought by the family in case they move somewhere larger. Big family: David and Lisa Stewart and their seven children aged from three months to six years share just two bedrooms in their home in Alness in the Scottish Highlands . At home: Mrs Stewart and her children, who says they have tried to get a larger home from the council but say they have been put to the back of the queue . The Stewarts' children sleep four to a room, or share with their parents. Mr Stewart has accused his local council in the Highlands of losing his application form for a new house exchange twice and prioritising new families in the area. Mr Stewart said his family's sleeping arrangements are causing stress and has called for more space for his children . Mr Stewart said he and his wife fear for the health of their children living in such crowded conditions. 'I . put in for an exchange five years ago but I knew these things took time . and was prepared to be patient. 'Later I put . in a second application, widening the geographic area, because I felt . it might increase our chances if we were willing to be housed in other . places. 'Then I heard of a four-bedroom house becoming available . locally and I went to the council to ask if I could be considered for . it. I was shocked to be told they didn’t even have an application from . me. 'They said it must have gone astray in the post, but I didn’t . understand how that could happen twice.

"Microsoft is still on track to launch its much-rumoured smartwatch this month, after reports suggested the device is imminent. The Washington-based firm is expected to launch ‘within the next few weeks’ to make sure it’s available in time for Christmas, with rumours suggesting it will have a two-day battery life. Previous reports stated the device will be cross-platform, meaning it will sync with iOS, Android and Windows-based phones - and it may even have its display on the inside of the wrist. Scroll down for video . The Washington-based firm is expected to launch ‘within the next few weeks’ to make sure it’s available in time for Christmas, with rumours suggesting it will have a two-day battery life. Previous reports and patent files (pictured) stated the device will be cross-platform, meaning it will sync with iOS, Android and Windows phones . This would make the watch more 'natural' to use, and the screen would be visible by turning the wrist upwards. The latest claims were reported by Forbes over the weekend, and Microsoft has not yet responded to MailOnline’s request for comment. Rumours about the device began earlier this year, when a series of patent applications went public. Both the patents were originally filed back in 2012. The first, titled Discreetly Displaying Contextually Relevant Information on a display device, shows a smartwatch displaying notifications and GPS navigation. Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but previous rumours claim: . The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue. It will be made of oxynitride aluminium - a translucent form of the metal. Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8. Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet. A source close to the plans has said the device will launch in October, and it could have its display on the inside of the wrist. It is also expected to work across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS and Windows PC. The second, called Dynamic User Interfaces Adapted to Inferred User Contexts, shows how Microsoft plans to add sensors to track the level of activity the wearer is doing - from sitting down to running. This second patent also explained that the interface would react to varying activity levels in different ways. Both patents show wrist worn devices that connect with a phone or other smart device, and are fitted with built-in heart rate monitors, accelerometers and GPS units. Although this technology is not new, Microsoft's patents pre-date current devices on the market – including Apple’s Watch. The claims made about Microsoft’s smartwatch battery life, if true, may set it apart from Apple’s proprietary device. Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Apple boss Tim Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch at an event last month was saying users would ‘charge it at night.’ The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. Sources also claimed Microsoft's gadget wouldn't be as bulky as Samsung's range of smartwatches, or the Moto 360. Instead, it is expected to be sleeker, thinner, and more closely resemble a fitness band, such as the Nike Fuelband (pictured) and Fitbit’s Flex .

The closest Apple boss Tim Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch at an event last month was saying that users would ‘charge it at night' Last month, a patent revealed Microsoft was additionally working on sports watch, with built-in heart rate monitor - but this technology may have been patented for use in its smartwatch . A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, while another source confirmed that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ The initial rumours about an October launch for Microsoft’s device originated from website Tom’s Hardware, which stated that a ‘trusted source with knowledge of the development’ confirmed the release, and that the phone will work across multiple platforms. At the moment, Samsung’s range of smartwatches and Apple’s first wearable only work with their own handsets. Future versions of Microsoft's smartwatch may also feature the firm's Analog Keyboard Project that lets a user draw letters, numbers and even symbols in the middle of watch, which are then registered by the device. The prototype, reported by Gizmodo, is currently compatible both with square Android watches and the circular Moto 360 so far. The handwriting method allows the whole screen to be used for each character, rather than classic typing methods where part of the screen must be obscured. This leaves room on the left for a large backspace button, and on the right for a space bar button. But for now, only lowercase English letters, numbers and basic punctuation symbols can be used.

"What a contest. What drama. And it came in the shape of the proverbial game of two halves. Atlanta led 21-0 at the break,  but 22 unanswered points from Detroit saw the Lions clinch a stunning victory. And what a denouement. Detroit’s season has been plagued with kicking woes, and Matt Prater looked as though he had blown it by scuffing a 43-yard field goal attempt wide of the right upright. But with four seconds on the clock, he was handed a second chance  due to a delay of game penalty. This time, he made no mistake from 48-yards and sent the Lions to 6-2.

As it happened, neither showed up at Wembley. But Golden Tate did, putting on 151 receiving yards and a breathtaking 59-yard touchdown to give the Lions a foothold in the third quarter. It was his fourth 110-yard plus outing in five games as the Super Bowl-winner continues to thrive in Detroit after his move from Seattle. While Matt Ryan gave glimpses of why he is the tenth best-paid athlete on the planet in the first half, he faded badly, throwing two interceptions. Stud receiver Julio Jones also dropped a straightforward catch to hand the Lions the chance to steal the game. Matt Stafford, missing three tight ends and his favourite target, had struggled, throwing wildly and failing to find wide open receivers. But like last week’s come-from-behind victory against the Saints, when it mattered, Stafford produced a game-winning final drive from Detroit’s seven yard line.

Trainers check on Detroit Lions defensive tackle Nick Fairley on the sideline in the first half of the match with Atlanta Falcons . The Falcons, who suffered a fifth straight defeat, will look long and hard at themselves after this shattering loss. With a battered offensive line, there were fears that Mike Smith’s men would be eaten alive by one of the NFL’s most fearsome front sevens. After all, they had mustered just 20 points in their last two games. But it didn’t start like that, as Ryan surgically sliced apart the Lions from the off. A strong opening drive saw little interior pressure from the Lions’ front four. Allowed ample time in the pocket, Ryan marched up the field, connecting with Jones, White and Levine Toilolo before Devonta Freeman clutched the ball from the air one-handed for a seven-yard touchdown pass. It was the first time the Lions conceded had a touchdown in the first half for four games. Detroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate catches a touchdown pass in the second half as the Lions make a remarkable comeback . Detroit Lions wide receiver Tate (left) celebrates a touchdown with wide receiver Jeremy Ross (right) in the second half . After Stafford’s opening drive stalled, Ryan was on the move again. Using a variety of receivers, the returning Harry Douglas made a key interception on third and eight, and the Falcons were perched in the Red Zone. Ryan made it look easy, finding a tip-toeing Bear Pascoe wide open for his first Atlanta touchdown. By the end of the first quarter, the crowd were stunned. Ryan was almost faultless, completing nine out of ten passes for 104 yards with two touchdowns. Joique Bell (centre) of the Detroit Lions runs at the Falcons defence during the NFL match at Wembley . The second quarter brought more misery for Detroit with Nick Fairley suffering an injury to his right knee. As the giant defensive tackle grappled with Ryan, team-mate Ndamukong Suh fell into his leg. Fairley hobbled off with a suspected MCL tear. And the Lions slipped further behind just before the break. Steven Jackson became the 19th athlete to eclipse the 11,000-yard rushing barrier and went over on the next down to make it a three-score game. If all the talk at half-time was of another Wembley blowout, whatever was said in the Lions locker room worked. Using screen passes to great success, they avoided a blowout thanks to Matt Prater’s field goal, and Stafford combined with Tate with that sensational 59-yard touchdown to bring the loudest cheer of the afternoon. On third and 35, Stafford scrambled and bought himself time before lobbing a laser to Tate, who had eluded Atlanta’s shoddy secondary. Breathtaking stuff.

Falcons cheerleaders put on a show for the Wembley crowd as they perform during the match between Detroit Lions and  Atlanta Falcons . It was Stafford’s 119th touchdown pass in Lions history, a franchise record. As Atlanta continued to implode, Detroit reduced the deficit further with another Prater field goal. And the gap was cut to two points after Stafford found Theo Riddick for a five-yard touchdown. Stafford failed to connect with Tate for the two-point conversion but they got the ball back after Jones’ costly drop. Both teams head into a mid-season bye and while the flight home will be a jubilant one for Detroit, one imagines it will be a sombre mood on the plane to Georgia. And while Falcons owner Arthur Blank has said he has no plans for a change of head coach, their record is a meagre one. And this defeat will hurt.

According . to another tweet from Holthaus, the Dutch artist known as Tinkebell, . who calls attention to animal rights issues through works that use the . remains of dead animals, had herself sterilised last week for a similar . reason. Holthaus, who now writes for Quartz, has decided he will also reduce his carbon footprint by giving up on air travel. ‘I just broke down in tears in boarding area at SFO while on phone with my wife. I've never cried because of a science report before. #IPCC,’ was his first tweet on around 2pm on Friday. ‘I realised just now: This has to be the last flight I ever take. I’m committing right now to stop flying. It’s not worth the climate,’ he tweeted a few minutes later. 'Broke down': Holthaus' first tweet after reading the report .

Adios babies: He says the decision to not have children is 'emotional' Vasectomy: His last tweet toys with the idea of getting sterilised . Scientists say human activity is the dominant cause of global warming, a long-term trend that is clear despite a recent plateau in the temperatures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used its strongest language yet in the report on the causes of climate change, prompting calls for global action to control emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. ‘If this isn't an alarm bell, then I don't know what one is. If ever there were an issue that demanded greater cooperation, partnership, and committed diplomacy, this is it,’ said US Secretary of State John Kerry. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the report was 'an alarm bell' The IPCC, which has 195 member countries, adopted the report Friday after all-night talks at a meeting in Stockholm. In its previous assessment, in 2007, the U.N.-sponsored panel said it was ‘very likely’ that global warming was due to human activity, particularly the CO2 emissions resulting from the burning of coal, oil and gas. The change means that scientists have moved from being 90 per cent sure to 95 per cent - about the same degree of certainty they have that smoking kills. 'At 90 percent it means there is a 10 percent probability that it's not entirely correct,' said Chris Field, Carnegie Institution scientist who is a leader in the IPCC but wasn't involved in the report released Friday. 'And now that's 5 per cent. So it's a doubling of our confidence. That's actually a consequential change in our level of understanding.' One of the most controversial . subjects in the report was how to deal with what appears to be a . slowdown in warming if you look at temperature data for the past 15 . years. Climate . skeptics say this 'hiatus' casts doubt on the scientific consensus on . climate change, even though the past decade was the warmest on record. In . the end, the IPCC made only a brief mention of the issue in the summary . for policymakers, stressing that short-term records are sensitive to . natural variability and don't in general reflect long-term trends. The IPCC raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 10-32 inches (26-82 centimeters) by the end of the century, compared to previous reports predicting a rise of 7-23 inches (18-59 centimeters) 'An . old rule says that climate-relevant trends should not be calculated for . periods less than around 30 years,' said Thomas Stocker, co-chair of . the group that wrote the report. The IPCC said the evidence of climate . change has grown thanks to more and better observations, a clearer . understanding of the climate system and improved models to analyse the . impact of rising temperatures. The . full 2,000-page report isn't going to be released until Monday, but the . summary for policymakers with the key findings was published Friday. It . contained few surprises as many of the findings had been leaked in . advance. As expected, the IPCC raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 10-32 inches (26-82 centimeters) by the end of the century. The previous report predicted a rise of 7-23 inches (18-59 centimeters). Using four scenarios with different emissions controls, the report projected that global average temperatures would rise by 0.3 to 4.8 degrees C this century. That's 0.5-8.6 F. The report adopted Friday deals with the physical science of climate change. Next year, the IPCC will adopt reports on the impacts of global warming, strategies to fight it and a synthesis of all three reports.","Eric Holthaus, who used to do weather for Wall Street Journal, was reacting to Friday's findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .

"Roy Keane is prepared to call a truce with Alex Ferguson — providing his former manager apologises for ‘bad mouthing’ the Cork man after he left Manchester United. In an interview to be published with FourFourTwo magazine today, the former Old Trafford captain insists he would have no problem sitting down for a cup of tea with the Scot, so long as he acknowledged the disparaging remarks made in the aftermath of his acrimonious departure from the club in 2005. Asked whether he would ever meet up with Ferguson and go for a pint, Keane replied: ‘Well, it would be a cup of tea. If Sir Alex apologises, then yes, I would.

And Keane remains defiant in his stance since his departure, making his feelings perfectly clear to supporters who feel his legacy was tarnished by his final days at the club. ‘If United fans say I had a decent career then brilliant.

"Parallel universe: Richard Butler-Creagh told 'lie after lie' in trying to establish his claim to the £5million . A man who tried to squeeze a £5million fee from the sale of the house that inspired Toad Hall was told he 'lives in a parallel universe' by a High Court judge in London yesterday. Richard Butler-Creagh hoped to make millions by acting as an intermediary in the sale of Fawley Court near Henley-on-Thames in Buckinghamshire. And yesterday he went to court to sue the company set up to buy the 17th Century pile for the disputed £5million fee. But Mr Justice Eady threw out the legal action against Aida Hersham and . Cherrilow Limited after he found that Mr Butler-Creagh had constructed an elaborate scheme to convince the defendants . to pay him millions for doing 'effectively nothing'. He said the case was rife with allegations of dishonesty with each side accusing the other of forging documents and Ms Hersham and Cherrilow characterising Mr Butler-Creagh as a 'confidence trickster' and 'middle man' fraudster. Mr Butler-Creagh had acquired the contract for the grand . house - thought to have been designed by Christopher Wren - from the . Marian Fathers, a Roman Catholic order, for £22.5million in 2008. He . claimed Ms Hersham, an Iranian heiress living in Belgravia, London, . owed him a £5million 'facilitating fee' after he agreed to let her 'step . into his shoes' and buy the impressive property. The grand Fawley Court was reputedly Kenneth . Grahame's inspiration for Toad Hall in his 1908 classic The Wind In The . Willows. Ms Hersham denied that there had been any such agreement. Cherrilow eventually bought the stunning country property for £13million. Mr Justice Eady threw out the action after finding Mr Butler-Creagh had failed to establish his case, adding that it was clear the developer had a scheme in mind. The judge said it was clear Mr Butler-Creagh did not have the means to buy the property on his own and had instead planned to bring someone else in to provide the funding. He added: 'He was then to take a turn or commission by placing himself . between that person and the Marian Fathers. 'He saw the opportunity to make £5million for doing effectively nothing.' 'In order to achieve that, he would . have to deceive both the Marian Fathers, by giving them the false . impression that he had the means and the intention to acquire the . property himself, and the hapless punter, by pretending to him or her . that he was a necessary intermediary. 'In truth, and in law, he had no other role than as an officious bystander.' Toad Hall: Fawley Court, near Henley-on-Thames, Buckinghamshire, was at the centre of a £5million court dispute . Mr Butler-Creagh, added the judge in London, 'told lie after lie' in his dealings with the Marian Fathers and Ms Hersham. 'He even lied in his witness . statements before the court, claiming for example that the Bank of . Ireland had previously provided finance for him in respect of other . property developments. This he sought to explain away in court as a . mistake.' The buyer: Aida Hersham, an Iranian heiress, denied that she had agreed to pay Mr Butler-Creagh any fee . Despite his . audacious lies, Mr Justice Eady said Mr Butler-Creagh had given the . impression of being confident and self-assured while giving evidence to . court. 'Yet it emerged very . clearly from his two days and more of cross-examination that he lives in . a parallel universe where truth and falsehood imperceptibly merge, the . one into the other, he being quite insensitive to the distinction . between them,' the judge said. In his own mind Mr Butler-Creagh justified such behaviour as being necessary to survive in what the developer described as 'a commercial world out there'. He had accepted in court that he was 'not too scrupulous' in what he was prepared to say to obtain business opportunities. The judge concluded that Cherrilow did rely, as always intended by Mr Butler-Creagh, on false misrepresentations of fact and had it not done so, the purchase would not have been made. The company claims it has lost £9,864,940 from the transaction, but any compensation payments have yet to be finalised.","'He told lie after lie' High Court in London is told .

"A New York-based commercial photographer has launched a campaign called Not a Bully which aims to challenge the all-too-common view of pit bulls as a 'bully-breed'. Douglas Sonders, 32, himself the owner of a pit bull mix called Emma, feels compelled to speak up for a breed that is often neglected, mistreated and typecast as mean, aggressive or dangerous. 'Despite what some bad humans have done to these dogs, they are inherently sweet and very trainable,' he tells MailOnline. Happy face: Photographer Douglas Sonders captures the charming characters of rescue pit bulls, for his Not a Bully campaign, which hopes to change the way people see the breed for the better . In a stunning array of photographs, Mr Sonders captures a host of noble and gentle looking pit bulls, all of whom have touching stories and are now blessed with loving owners. Although it started off as a photo campaign, Not a Bully is growing. National Geographic Wild recently profiled Mr Sonders with Ceser Milan, the acclaimed TV dog trainer, who he describes as 'wonderfully enthusiastic about helping animals.' Mr Millan, who posed for Mr Sonders with his Pit Bull Junior, is now an avid supporter of Not a Bully's mission, and in return, Mr Sonders has been donating his time and efforts to the Cesar Millan foundation for abandoned and abused dogs. Famous friends: Mr Sonders (left) has gained support from TV dog trainer Cesar Millan (right) both seen posing with their handsome pit bulls for the campaign . Noble: Pit bulls are often referred to as 'bully-breeds' - assumed to be mean, aggressive and dangerous, but many proud owners know them to entirely the opposite . But it was Emma, the pit bull mix Mr Sonders adopted two years ago, who started it all. When his beloved boxer dog, Winston Churchull, died leaving Mr Sonders 'heart wrecked', he decided, following a period of intense mourning, to adopt a new canine companion. He didn't know quite what he was looking for, but he says he planned to avoid pit bulls, assuming, like many others, that they were a difficult breed. Not so scary: This pampered pooch, named London, was rescued from a life on the streets of Baltimore, and couldn't look less intimidating with her wonky ears and soft pink bandana . Inspiration: Emma is the two-year-old pit bull mix adopted by Mr Sonders, who taught him what a loving, gentle breed she comes from and sparked his Not a Bully campaign . 'I’ve since learned that “pit bull” is a bad word in society, which is a real tragedy,' he says, adding that over 40 per cent of dogs in shelters are 'bully-breeds' and 22 per cent of pit bulls are euthanized regardless of their disposition. Still, the day he walked into his local Petco adoption drive and saw one-year-old Emma sitting quietly at the back of the room, he was in love. Emma had been rotated around foster care for nine months prior to finding a forever home with Mr Sonders. 'No-one wanted her because she was a pit-mix with black fur,' he recalls. Unfair: Mr Sonders says he 'tears up' every time he thinks about the fact that Emma (pictured) was nearly euthanized because of the way she looks . Savior: Winnie (pictured) was adopted by a shy little ten-year-old girl, whom she helped 'break out of her shell' - the pair now compete in dog training competitions together . 'The thought makes me tear up when I think how she was nearly put to sleep because of how she looks.' Aside from her tendency to sneak into Mr Sonders' bed when he's away, Emma is 'perfectly behaved; naturally gentle, great with kids and other dogs, and an excellent running partner', according to her loving owner. Still, to his disappointment, Mr Sonders noticed his neighbors 'recoil' when they first saw him around the neighborhood with Emma - a knee jerk reaction he hopes he can shift with his project. Buddies: Cesar Millian (pictured with his dog Junior) appeared in the campaign and were filmed with Mr Sonders for a National Geographic documentary about pit bulls . Sleek: Mr Millan is well-known for his work with behaviorally challenged dogs, but his own four-legged friend poses no trouble at all . Behind the scenes: Mr Millan can be seen attracting his dog's attention with a fluorescent ball as Mr Sonders dutifully snaps away . Another portrait in the series stars Winnie, who was adopted by ten-year-old Gillie, a shy little girl who found she was finally able to break out of her shell after finding a four-legged friend in Winnie. The two now compete in dog training competitions together. London was rescued from a tough life on the streets of Baltimore, and nursed back to health by volunteers at Good Doggie Daycare. Her adoptive owner, Carolyn, discovered that London, her first pit bull, was 'gentle, smart and good with all other living beings.' Porter is undoubtedly the most heart-wrenching subject Mr Sonders has photographed. He was found on the street with his legs crushed and his jaw smashed by an unknown assailant. Disgrace: What looked like it would be a grisly ending for poor Porter (pictured) turned into a hopeful tale, when a rescuer at the Humane Society ensured he was nursed back to health following a brutal attack on him . Heart of gold: Porter won everyone over by displaying nothing but love, despite his awful mistreatment, and now has a happy forever home . Child friendly: Mr Sonders seen visiting a local elementary school with his trusty Emma, to teach kids about the negatives of dog abuse and the importance of adoption, particularly with pit bulls . Despite his despicable treatment, Porter showed nothing but a warm, trusting heart to rescuers at the Humane Society. Instead of putting him to sleep, Julie Conway, an employee at the organization, paid out of her own pocket to save him. He now fronts one of the I'm Not a Bully campaigns ads. Hundreds of thousands of pit bull and other 'bully breeds' are put to sleep in the U.S. every year, and breed-specific legislation currently bans them from several states - essentially serving these dogs with a death sentence. The ASPA credits 'putative over-reporting and false reporting' of pit bull attacks on humans as a major cause for their public perception. Man's best friend: Mr Sonders (pictured with Emma) hopes he can get people to see the breed in a new light, so that more pit bulls can enjoy happy endings . In fact, it's the human attacks on what many insist to be a naturally gentle breed that perhaps need addressing; attacks mainly in the form those who abuse pit bulls, use them as 'bait' and force them into cruel dog-fighting rings. Mr Sonders points to the case of Michael Vick, the New York Jets quarterback who was jailed in 2007 for mistreating pit bulls as part of vicious dog-fighting racket. Almost all of Mr Vick's former fighting dogs were placed in family homes after positive training rehab, he reveals. At the end of the day, the Not a Bully campaign simply hopes to shine a very different light on this little-understood breed, so that more pit bulls can enjoy happy endings.

"A press conference with the FA’s director of elite development Dan Ashworth at St George’s Park on Wednesday will mark a considerable power shift in control of the England football team. Ashworth, already anointed by chairman Greg Dyke as the new technical director, will be giving a presentation of the ‘England DNA’ that will act as the blueprint for the playing style and preparation of international teams and, hopefully, eventually lead to tournament success. The fact Ashworth is going public with his plans, formulated with his growing army of technical specialists handpicked since he arrived from West Brom in September 2012, shows he has the full backing of the FA hierarchy to take the helm in plotting England football’s future. England's director of football Dan Ashworth will present his new blueprint to improve the Three Lions' fortunes . The FA board, who had the first viewing of Ashworth’s masterplan, want to give his department their head, knowing a proper long-term strategy is in place rather than the previous haphazard regime under Sir Trevor Brooking. The repercussions will see the Wembley-based Club England set-up having to fit in with Ashworth’s agenda run from St George’s Park, where the next England manager is more likely to have his main office within Ashworth’s technical area. The FA promised a sponsor for their flagship FA Cup would be in place by the third round of the tournament. But the draw takes place on Monday with no sign of a backer to replace £9million-a-year Budweiser. For the FA’s hapless commercial department, who brought in an expensive recruit from Manchester United for this search, it is a fiasco on a par with the England team exiting the World Cup after two group matches. A spokesman said they ‘remain confident’ of finding that elusive sponsor. At least the FA can’t be faulted for their scrupulous recognition of almost every military encounter in history. There are no fewer than three major set-pieces starting this weekend marking the centenary of the Christmas truce football match with Germany in no-man’s land, as well as twin team photos. The FA are still struggling to find a flagship sponsor to replace Budweiser's £9million-a-year deal . ITV Sport would be keen to have Roy Keane back on their roster of pundits following his departure from Aston Villa. But they will allow the Irishman to concentrate on his role as assistant manager with the Republic before asking him back. Meanwhile, Keane’s autobiography remains high in the best-seller charts, while Kevin Pietersen’s book, launched in the same week in October, is unlikely to remain in the top 10 next week. ITV Sport will wait before asking Roy Keane (left) to return on their roster of pundits .

However, the 25-minute show on the Twickenham pitch will not feature any of the live animals from Danny Boyle’s Olympic launch, with speculation still around on Wednesday as to whether all the sheep survived the event. lt sums up the grandstanding by some MPs over the World Cup corruption inquiry that Tory MP Damian Collins fancifully called for the Serious Fraud Office to get involved — even though it has no jurisdiction to do so.

"President Barack Obama announced an executive order covering 'climate-resilient international development' on Tuesday that will force federal agencies to consider the global-warming impact of international development work, including overseas programs that fight diseases like the Ebola virus. Speaking of climate change during a speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, Obama warned that the world must 'tackle this global threat before it is too late.' The White House cited 'fighting malaria' as one example of an initiative that it aims to bring into sync with its position that global climate change is both real and caused by human activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention typically engages in such epidemic-related work. It has already deployed more than 100 relief workers to Liberia and Sierra Leone. But Obama's new order will necessarily mean that the CDC and other agencies in his administration will have what one insider called 'an unnecessary hurdle' to leap over when emergencies normally lead to urgency. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama spoke at the United Nations Climate Summit on Tuesday, spelling out a new executive order that critics say will make it harder to fight diseases and engage in other relief work overseas . The CDC estimated Tuesday that the current Ebola outbreak could affect 1.4 million people by the end of January 2015. An official with that agency told MailOnline that she is 'concerned' about the president's order, but 'of course we'll comply. I hope this impacts long-term planning more than emergencies.' Obama's executive order specifically refers to 'agency strategies, planning, programs, projects, investments, overseas facilities, and related funding decisions,' broad categories that could impact even last-minute decisions like those related to the African Ebola outbreak. The CDC official noted also that the order doesn't appear to impact any of the CDC's operations inside the United States. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The text of Obama's executive order, and his United Nations speech Tuesday in New York, indicate that he and his advisers have accepted some of the most apocalyptic predictions of environmental advocates. 'The adverse impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, increases in temperatures, more frequent extreme precipitation and heat events, more severe droughts, and increased wildfire activity, along with other impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, such as ocean acidification, threaten to roll back decades of progress in reducing poverty and improving economic growth in vulnerable countries,' the order reads in part. He told the UN that the world will soon be subject to 'more extreme weather events' that will bring 'impacts that we can unfortunately no longer avoid.' 'In America the last decade has been our hottest on record,' he claimed, while taking credit for doing 'more than any other nation on earth' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But we have to do more.' Impact: A CDC official, the agency currently leading the fight against Ebola in Africa, told MailOnline that she was 'concerned' about the new orders. She added: 'Of course we'll comply. I hope this impacts long-term planning more than emergencies' 'In our west, wildfire season stretches most of the year.' he said. Moments later Obama blamed climate change for making U.S. farmland both 'drenched' with too much rain and left in 'drought' by too little. 'The alarm bells keep ringing,' he said. 'Our citizens keep marching.' Obama acknowledged that other nations' slow responses – when they respond at all – to America's urging on carbon emissions is rooted in the fear that industrial costs will spiral and change bottom-line business viability. Obama acknowledged a global 'suspicion that if we act and other countries don't, we will be at an economic disadvantage.' 'None of this is without controversies,' he said, but 'every country must play its part.' Internationally, he said the United States would begin considering how global warming will impact its relief and development efforts before putting them into action. 'Development investments in areas as diverse as eradicating malaria, building hydropower facilities, improving agricultural yields, and developing transportation systems,' said an information sheet provided by the White House, 'will not be effective in the long term if they do not account for impacts such as shifting ranges of disease-carrying mosquitoes, changing water availability, or rising sea levels.'","US president warned that global warming impacts 'threaten to roll back decades of progress' in America's international outreach .

"She is not a woman to mince her words regardless of the subject. So when confronted by sexist men who wanted to know why she didn’t have children, Helen Mirren was typically forthright – even managing to turn the air blue in doing so. The Oscar-winning actress said it has never been women who have questioned her childless existence, but ‘only boring old men. And whenever they went, ""What? No children? Well, you’d better get on with it, old girl"", I’d say, ""No! F*** off""!’ Miss Mirren, 67, the second of three children, has often spoken about her lack of maternal instinct. Dame Helen Mirren has got short shrift for the 'boring old men' who have questioned her lack of maternal instinct in an interview in the new edition of Vogue . In the past she has said she tried to talk herself into having children but does not regret her decision not to. In a new interview for British Vogue, Miss Mirren touched on the subject once more, confessing: ‘It was not my destiny. I kept thinking it would be, waiting for it to happen, but I never did, and I didn’t care what people thought.’ Her magnificent portrayal of Elizabeth II in the 2007 film The Queen earned Miss Mirren an Academy Award for best actress and global fame. Miss Mirren, who is married to director Taylor Hackford, is set to reprise her role as The Queen in play The Audience, which will open later this year. But she admits she was worried about being typecast when she accepted the role the second time around. She said: ‘Of course I wasn’t going to turn it down, it’s a lovely role to inhabit. But at the same time, I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back there. 'It was hard enough wriggling out of being Jane Tennison. I do sometimes think, if I die in a plane crash tomorrow, will people always think of me as The Actress Most Famous for Playing the Queen?' Earlier this year Miss Mirren revealed her no-nonsense approach even extended to romance. She married her husband in 1997 after 11 years together and said they don’t send each other Valentine’s cards, and they regularly forget to mark birthdays with a present. She said: ‘Taylor and I aren’t remotely romantic with each other. And actually we appreciate the lack of romance in the other person. ‘I’d be completely horrified if Taylor gave me a Valentine’s card. That’s not our sort of relationship at all - we would pour cold water on that sort of thing. ‘We even forget to get each other birthday presents - I’m always thinking the day before, “Oh, I must get Taylor something for his birthday”.'

"A man stabbed to death last week on a Las Vegas Strip pedestrian walkway has been identified today as a homeless ex-convict from Pennsylvania dubbed the 'pantyhose prankster.' Rip Alan Swartz, 46, made thousands of random calls to banks, restaurants and other numbers he found in telephone books before he provided his real name to a Virginia woman and was arrested in 2011, said Detective Sgt. Thomas Kauffman, of the Upper Allen Township Police Department in Pennsylvania. 'He would stay up all night and make phone calls,' Kauffman recalled Tuesday. Murdered: A man stabbed to death last week on a Las Vegas Strip pedestrian walkway was identified on Tuesday as Rip Alan Swartz nicknamed the 'pantyhose prankster' 'He said the same thing on every call, mainly focused on pantyhose. By the time it got around to that, most women would hang up.' Swartz's name became public as his alleged assailant, Calvin Boyden III, 22, of Las Vegas, made an initial court appearance on felony murder and robbery charges in the 12:40 a.m. Nov. 25 slaying on a foot bridge over Las Vegas Boulevard near the multi-hotel CityCenter complex. Boyden appeared in shackles and said nothing while Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Janiece Marshall assigned a deputy public defender, Norm Reed, to the case and set a Dec. 15 preliminary hearing. Boyden was being held without bail at the Clark County jail. Reed said Boyden plans to plead not guilty. Reed said he wanted to review the police investigation and view security video before talking about the case. A motive for the slaying wasn't immediately clear, but police said Boyden and Swartz were involved in a confrontation on the walkway before the stabbing, and that Boyden left the walkway before he was arrested. Swartz was taken to University Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Jail records show that Boyden also was held on felony domestic battery with a weapon and burglary charges stemming from what Reed said was a separate incident. It took several days to locate Swartz's next-of-kin, coroner's officials in Las Vegas said Monday. Records showed Swartz, originally from Shiremanstown, Pennsylvania, was convicted in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, of felony telephone harassment and served from October to December 2011 in state prison, said Sue McNaughton, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Swartz told a judge in October 2011 that he was ashamed to have made thousands of obscene calls during a five-year period, and he said he hoped to complete a treatment program and put the calls behind him.

"Skipping breakfast in childhood may raise the risk of diabetes in later life, scientists claim. British research suggests youngsters who do not eat the morning meal every day may be increasing their chances of developing the ‘type 2’ form of the disease as they get older. A study by scientists at Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow and St George’s London universities found children who missed breakfast were more likely to be insulin-resistant – a key factor in the disease. Scientists found that children who skip breakfast could increase their chance of developing type 2 diabetes . They tracked more than 4,000 British primary school pupils aged nine and ten, monitoring how often they had breakfast and what they ate. Children who did not have the morning meal were significantly more likely to have blood markers associated with diabetes risk than those who always ate breakfast. They had higher insulin levels after not eating and their bodies were less able to respond to the hormone, which normally regulates the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. Those skipping food first thing in the morning had very slightly higher blood sugar levels than children who regularly ate breakfast. The study, published last night in the journal PLOS Medicine, concluded: ‘The observed associations suggest that regular breakfast consumption, particularly involving consumption of a high-fibre cereal, could protect against the early development of type 2 diabetes risk.’ Lead researcher Dr Angela Donin, of St George’s, University of London, said the study had not directly established why skipping the meal raises the risk of diabetes. But she said it may be because those who do not have a healthy breakfast are more likely to snack on fatty foods later. Eating cereal also provides a source of fibre, which has been shown to protect against the disease, she added. Almost three million people in the UK are believed to have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to lifestyle and obesity. The disease occurs when the body stops responding to insulin or produces too little of the hormone. Children had higher insulin levels after not eating and their bodies were less able to respond to the hormone, which normally regulates the amount of sugar in the bloodstream (pictured a model tests blood sugar levels) This results in sugar building up in the bloodstream instead of being used as fuel, leading to symptoms such as extreme tiredness and thirst. Diabetes can also cause blindness and kidney failure, and increase a person’s chance of heart disease and stroke. Dr Donin said: ‘There is evidence that if you skip breakfast you are more likely to be overweight. ‘This could be explained by your eating patterns for the rest of the day. If you have not eaten breakfast you are more likely to snack – and those snacks are more likely to be energy-heavy.’ She added: ‘Eating breakfast every day could reduce the snacking behaviour for the rest of the day.’ Diabetes UK, which funded the study, said more research is needed into the link between the disease and eating breakfast. Dr Alasdair Rankin, director of research at the charity, said: ‘We already know that giving your child a healthy breakfast, as part of a balanced diet, can have a range of benefits for health and wellbeing. ‘More research will be needed to help us understand the exact link between eating breakfast and the development of type 2 diabetes, including studies that follow children through to adulthood to see how many young people with these warning signs go on to develop the condition.’","Scientists tracked over 4,000 British primary school pupils aged 9 and 10 .

"A rare Hermès tote sold at auction yesterday to an anonymous bidder for $185,000, the second-highest price ever paid for a Birkin bag. The Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin - encrusted with 245 diamonds, boasting 18-karat white gold hardware and crafted from extremely pale crocodile skin - sent bidders into a frenzy via phone, online and in person at Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. Managing Director of the auction house, Kathleen Guzman told CBS MoneyWatch: 'Hermès raises crocodiles on its own farm, breeding them to have very light coloring. 'But then to search for a crocodile that has almost an albino skin is extraordinarily rare.' Scroll down for video . Eye-watering: This rare Hermès Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin (pictured) sold at auction yesterday to an anonymous bidder for $185,000, the second-highest price ever paid for a Birkin bag . According to Ms Guzman, it probably took a Hermès designer 'a full year' to craft the bag, and mentioned that if it should become scratched or damaged, the company vows to repair the flaws 'immediately.' Given its eye-watering price, however, it seems unlikely that this bag will ever grace the arm of its mystery owner. 'Hermès is the only line of bags that can sell on the secondary market for more than their retail price,' Ms Guzman said, adding that as a result, these bags tend to be traded purely as investments. The Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin sold for $35,000 more than its estimated value of $150,000, making it only second in price to a diamond-encrusted Birkin which sold in 2011 for $203,150. Careful! Hermès is the only line of bags that can sell on the secondary market for more than their retail price, and as a result, they tend to be traded purely as investments . Reptilian: The bag is encrusted with 245 diamonds, boasting 18-karat white gold hardware and crafted from the skin of an extremely pale crocodile, raised by Hermès on its own farm . More money than sense? The covetable fashion piece sent bidders into a frenzy via phone, online and in person at Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills, California . Handbags of this high caliber are produced in tiny batches and reserved only for a 'select number' of elite Hermès clients. Even a standard Birkin comes with a waiting list and a $10,000 starting price tag. According to Ms Guzman, if you walked into any Hermès store in the world and asked for one off the shelf, 'they would look at you like you had two heads.' Victoria Beckham is famously fond of the Hermès design, reportedly owning a collection worth over $2 million, while Kim Kardashian has so many that she uses one as a gym bag. Interior: The bag sold for $35,000 more than its estimated value of $150,000; making it only second in price to a diamond-encrusted Birkin which sold in 2011 for $203,150 . Insured: Hermès has promised to repair any scratches, flaws or damage that may befall the bag 'immediately' Ironically, the woman the Birkin bag was originally inspired by and named after - actress Jane Birkin -  doesn't even like them. The British star has famously denounced them as 'bloody heavy' - and said the one she owns hurts her arm. The Birkin came into existence following a chance meeting on an airplane between Ms Birkin and Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas in 1981. Mr Dumas watched as Ms Birkin struggled to get her straw bag into the overhead compartment - and when she finally did, the contents fell back to the floor. Pasty: Managing Director of the auction house, Kathleen Guzmansaid: 'Hermès raises crocodiles on its own farm... but for a crocodile [to have] almost an albino skin is extraordinarily rare.' (Stock image) Ms Birkin, who is best known for her film roles in the 1960s and for being the partner of French singer Serge Gainsborough, explained she couldn't find a decent weekend bag. In response, Mr Dumas modified an existing design and in 1984, the Birkin Bag was launched. It was an instant hit with fashionistas around the world - but Ms Birkin herself was less than impressed. In an interview in 2012 Birkin grumbled: 'What's the use of having a second one? You only need one and that busts your arm - they're bloody heavy. 'I'm going to have to have an operation for tendinitis in the shoulder.'","The Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin Bag is described as 'the rarest and most desirable handbag in the world'

"The man commissioned by the family of Michael Brown to perform a second autopsy on the body is having his credentials called into question, and many wondering if he does indeed qualify as an 'expert' in his field. Shawn Parcells, of Overland Park, Kansas, assisted Dr. Michael Baden in the autopsy of Brown, and briefly became a national figure, appearing on various news programs and being quoted in papers around the country after he revealed his findings. This even though the man is not a doctor, can not conduct an autopsy alone, and is unable to prove his claim that he is a college professor. Scroll down for videos . Expert?: Shawn Parcells (above) assisted in the second autopsy of Michael Brown that was commissioned by his family . Calling into question: Now Parcells, who does not claim to be a doctor, is having his credentials called into question, with the university he claims to teach at saying he has never worked there . The chief medical examiner of St. Louis County, Dr Mary Case, called what Parcells does 'abysmal' back in August, after learning he had been hired to assist on Brown's autopsy. Case, who conducted the first autopsy of Brown, told The Daily Caller, 'He is doing forensic autopsies which may send someone to prison, and he is not a physician, much less a forensic pathologist.' She then added that she was 'shocked by this man and how bold he is to do what he does.' Parcells claims he became interested in death as a child when his grandfather passed away, and began performing autopsies while he was still in high school. He received a bachelor's degree in life sciences from Kansas State in 2003, and he told CNN he was immediately accepted to medical school in the Caribbean, but his wife got pregnant and he wanted her to receive her care in the United States, so he did not attend. He still has yet to attend medical school. He does claim to have master's degree in anatomy and physiology, with clinical correlation, but was unable to verify that with an actual diploma. He also claims to be an adjunct professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, something that officials at Washburn have denied. '[Parcells] is not now and has never been a member of the Washburn University faculty,"" according to a university spokeswoman. Skipping out: Parcells says he decided to not attend the medical school he was accepted to in the Caribbean as his wife (above) became pregnant and they wanted to have the baby in the United States . Then, there are the alleged problems that have come up during his actual autopsies. In 2012, Parcells Regional Forensic Services was hired by Andrew County, Missouri, to conduct an autopsy on Robert Forrester, a man they believe may have died as the result of a brain bleed after he had told officers two days earlier that his grandson had 'knocked me the f*** out.' Two deputy sheriffs in Andrew County say that Parcells presented himself as a pathologist, this even though he is not and must have a medical doctor present in order for the findings in his autopsy to be presented in a court of law. There was no medical doctor present during the autopsy. Making the situation even more odd, the pathologist listed on the autopsy form, Edward R. Friedlander, M.D., refused to comment on the case, and when Parcells was pressed, he claimed that the autopsy was actually performed by Dr. George Vandermark. Dr. Vandermark said he had nothing to do with Forrester's autopsy. 'I see him as a fraud,' said one of the deputies. The sheriffs had been hoping to charge Forrester's grandson with manslaughter, but with no legal autopsy having been performed and no way to present the findings of a medical expert, it has now been two years since the death and they cannot move forward to prosecute. Other claims: One coroner says that Parcells disappeared with a body he was supposed to examine, and two deputy sheriffs in Missouri have labeled him a 'fraud' Then, there is the case of one funeral home, Northern Star Mortuary, Inc, who hired Parcells to perform an autopsy. After waiting over a week for Parcells to come examine an unidentified body, so long that maggots had started to appear, he finally came to collect the body and perform an autopsy. But Lenox Jones, the Pehlps County Deputy Coroner, says it has been over a year since the sutopsy, and he has no idea where the body is and has not heard from Parcells. Parcells grew irritated when presented with Jones' claim, and said the body in is his morgue in Topeka and could be collected at any time. Odd: Another woman says Parcells took her husband's brain, around the time this photo of a brain appeared on his Facebook page . In another odd incident, Judy Walker says she paid Parcells to examine her husband's brain after his death in 2011, and Parcells told her he would send the brain to Harvard to be examined. Three years later she received a report from a doctor in New York. She retained a lawyer, Michael Hodges, and at a deposition Parcells handed over a brain in a bucket saying it was that of Walker's husband. She did not believe him, and Parcells claims the brain is at his Topeka morgue if she ever wants to come pick it up.","Shawn Parcells, the man who assisted on Michael Brown's second autopsy, is having his credentials called into question .

Hamann was in the 2002 team, a beaten finalist in Yokohama as Rudi Voller’s side came up against the brilliance of the Brazilian Ronaldo. The former Liverpool and Manchester City midfielder has been monitoring the progress of Joachim Low’s team in Brazil, but isn’t convinced they have the qualities to reach the final. Germany play their second-round clash against Algeria on Monday evening, but the route to the final is treacherous. Hamann is not the type to get carried away by some good form in the group phase.

Hamann, . who played 59 times for Germany, added: ‘Lahm wants to play in the . centre because that’s where he has been playing his club football with . Bayern Munich. ‘He . should be playing at full-back, which is his best position. Lahm has . only been playing for six or seven months in a new position, but it’s . not enough time to learn it. ‘It is staggering that he is playing there after just a few months in the role with Bayern Munich. ‘Bayern . have 75 per cent possession in most of their games, but it is different . playing for the national team in that role.

In 2008 he swapped shirts with Wayne Rooney when Manchester United played the Pirates in a pre-season friendly in Durban. In 2013 his performances in the African Champions League were nothing short of exceptional. He kept seven clean-sheets in 16 games, helping the Pirates to the final. Since making his debut in 2013 against Swaziland, Meyiwa won six caps for South Africa, the most recent coming this month, as captain. During the current Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign Meyiwa has played all four games for South Africa, without conceding a single goal. In September he was made captain of the national team in the absence of Itumeleng Khune. Meyiwa poses with his pop-star girlfriend a week ago, in a picture she posted on her Instagram account . The South African police took to Twitter to break the news, breaking protocol to inform the South African people of the keeper's death . The police account emphasised their desire to bring the killers to justice, after suspects fled the scene . Police reported that two men entered the house where Meyiwa was shot,  where an altercation took place, while one waited outside. The South African goalkeeper was reportedly shot before all three suspects fled on foot. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital. On Monday morning police arrived in the township of Vosloorus, where the incident occurred, and started asking questions. A statement on behalf of South African sports minister Fikile Mbalula read: 'We have already interacted with the president of SAFA, Dr Danny Jordaan, Dr Irvin Khoza at Orlando Pirates as well as the father of Senzo Meyiwa.

'We urge the police to leave no stone unturned in apprehending the thugs as a matter of urgency. Our society will never be at peace until the suspects have been arrested and been brought under the wrath of the country's legal system. 'We would like to convey our heartfelt condolences to Senzo Meyiwa's family, his club, Orlando Pirates, the nation and the entire football and sporting fraternity.' Mbalula added: 'The death of Senzo Meyiwa has robbed this country of an icon and a legend in the making.' Police are offering a reward of 150,000 Rand (£8,500) for any information leading to the arrests of the suspects. Meyiwa's club, Orlando Pirates, released a statement expressing 'sadness' at his 'untimely death'. 'This is a sad loss whichever way you look at it - to Senzo's family, his extended family, Orlando Pirates and to the nation', commented the chairman Dr Irvin Khoza. The club will hold a press conference on Monday morning. Players from rivals Kaizer Chiefs were at the hospital on Sunday evening. The South African captain posted two pictures from international duty with Bafana Bafana from their recent games in the Congo . Meyiwa had been in superb form for both club and country recently, leading Orlando Pirates to last season's African Champions League final, including a superb performance against TP Mazembe during which he saved two penalties. Since breaking into the national team last year, he claimed the No 1 spot in the absence of Itumeleng Khune, and was made captain in September. During the current Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign Meyiwa played all four games for Bafana Bafana,without conceding a single goal. South Africa's head coach Ephraim Mashaba said: 'Since he took on that (captain's) role, we never had issues with the team and staff. 'We never had issues with players coming to us after that. 'He had that personality that meant that he could easily diffuse a situation. 'I spoke to a lady earlier, from last week in fact. Where he heard she was building a house. He gave her money to carry on. 'Senzo was not just a goalkeeper. He was a peacemaker. That's the biggest thing I remember about him. 'A good guy like Senzo will never just vanish. His spirit will live forever.' On Saturday night he was in goal for his club in a 4-1 victory over Ajax Cape Town, only conceding from a penalty. WATCH the game that made Senzo Meyiwa a star of African football as he saves two penalties against TP Mazembe . Meyiwa tweeted this picture with his South African team-mates earlier this month including the message #teamspirit . Kevin-Prince Boateng was among the stars of world football to pay his respects to the goalkeeper on Twitter . Doncaster midfielder Dean Furman, a team-mate of Meyiwa for South Africa, said he was 'beyond devastated' at the news. Furman tweeted: 'Beyond devastated at the loss of our captain and friend Senzo Meyiwa. Thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this terrible time'. Ghana and Schalke midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng also took to twitter to send his condolences. Boateng wrote 'TRAGEDY!!! R.I.P Senzo Meyiwa. My condolences to his family and friends.' South African seamer Vernon Philander said on Twitter: 'My thoughts and prayers goes out the family of Senzo Meyiwa. May you find the comfort in the Lord during this difficult time. RIP.' Meyiwa had become an important player for South Africa after impressive displays for Orlando Pirates over the past few years .

"Samantha Cameron regularly serves breakfast to homeless people in London, her husband David revealed today. The Prime Minister said his wife volunteers at The Passage, which helps 200 rough sleepers in London every day. The details of the charity work emerged as Mr Cameron used an interview with ITV's Philip Schofield to encourage people to give their time to good causes this Christmas. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron was pictured with head chef 'Nour' at The Passage homeless centre in London in March 2010, but David Cameron revealed she regularly goes there to cook breakfast . Mr Schofield met the Prime Minister in the first ever live interview from the Cabinet room in Number 10 as part of his 24-hour TV marathon, raising money for Text Santa. Mr Cameron congratulated him on his staying power and for raising money for charity. He said every member of the Cabinet would be training as Dementia Friends as part of a drive to encourage volunteering. And he revealed what he and his wife Samantha do for charity. The PM said: 'She goes to a homeless charity called The Passage which feeds homeless people in the morning, so she goes off and does that.' Mrs Cameron was pictured helping at The Passage during the 2010 election campaign, but this is the first time it has emerged that she is still working with the charity. It is understood she attends every few months. Four years ago she was pictured chopping carrots, stirring a stew and joking with volunteer chefs at The Passage in Central London. Mick Clarke, Passage CEO said: 'For many years Samantha has volunteered - like so many other people do - at The Passage. 'The Passage is all about ending homelessness for those who use our services and we simply could not deliver the diverse services we provide without volunteer support. 'The Passage has a 4:1 volunteer to staff ratio. The Passage has helped many people get back on their feet and end their homelessness, including helping over 2000 people into employment.' Mr Cameron was interviewed by ITV's Philip Schofield as part of the presenter's Text Santa challenge to remain on air for 24 hours . Mr Cameron added that his wife also does 'a bit of mentoring as well, which I've tried to do in the past and I hope to do more of in the future'. He went on: 'I think one of the best things people can do, if you've got some skills [is] to just try and transfer those skills onto people who haven't had all the opportunities and maybe the education you've had. 'And particularly something politicians are good at, actually, is helping people with whether it's interview skills or CVs or just giving people a bit of confidence and Sam does a bit of that, I've done a bit in the past and hope to do a bit more in the future.' Mr Cameron encouraged people to get involved in Giving Tuesday - a selfless alternative to the consumerist frenzies of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. 'This was something that started in America - I think it was partly a reaction to the crazed internet shopping that takes place before Christmas. 'I think it's a good moment to remember that, of course Christmas is about giving to family and friends, and buying gifts and the rest of it; but it's a moment also to think of others and to encourage giving.' It is thought to be the first time a live interview has been broadcast from the Cabinet room in Number 10 . Schofield has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity during his marathon presenting stint . Today members of the Cabinet are being trained to be dementia friends. The PM said a nurse from St Thomas' Hospital would train the Cabinet because it was important that people were made more aware of the problem of dementia. 'Particularly when loneliness is such an issue, when there are so many people living alone who don't necessarily have families surviving or there to look after them, actually reaching out and helping other people is hugely important,' he said. 'I've already done that, but every member of the Cabinet, by the end of today, will be a trained dementia friend. 'That's really important because it is such a challenge in our country, so many people having Alzheimer's and other conditions. And, as well as the research we need to fund, as well as the improvements in the health service we need, we also need our communities to be more dementia-friendly so that everybody knows how to handle, how to help people with these conditions.'","Prime Minister interviewed by Philip Schofield as part of TV marathon .

"This year's crop of virgin olive oil has been severely affected by drought in southern Europe . Nigella and Jamie might have to rethink some recipes after warnings of an international shortage of extra virgin olive oil. The ingredient, generously drizzled over everything from salads to pasta dishes and roasted vegetables, has fallen victim to weather extremes. While Britain suffered its wettest summer in 100 years during 2012, the farmers of Spain were struggling to cope with a drought. As a result, the Spanish . harvest is predicted to be down by as much as 60 per cent, creating . shortages of extra virgin olive oil and pushing up prices. Perversely, . British retailers are currently using olive oil as a loss leader, . cutting the price in order to attract middle class shoppers who will . also spend on other products. Tesco, . for example, is offering five extra virgin olive oils at half price, . ranging from £1.74 to £2.84 for 500ml. However, olive oil experts insist . that the economics of the market mean this cannot last. The . Hojiblanca Group, an Andalucian based co-operative of more than 50,000 . farmers, grows and presses more olives than anyone else in the world. Its . UK representative, Jeff Bayley, said: ‘With the harvest drawing to a . close latest returns are showing that the Spanish olive crop is a . fraction of previous years. ‘The . crop forecast is for 700,000 tonnes of olives in 2013 against 1.6m . tonnes last year following a sustained period of drought. ‘There will be a shortage of certain types of olive oil and this will definitely put upward pressure on prices.’ Mr . Bayley said the current supermarket price cuts ‘would be unsustainable . even if supplies were abundant’. He added: ‘With a shortage on the way . the current situation can’t last.’ Other . olive oil producing countries, including Greece, Italy, Turkey and . Tunisia, have had their own drought problems and will not be able to . make up the shortfall from Spain. The situation is expected to fuel a burgeoning black market in stolen olive oil and an increase in the widespread adulteration of olive oil with cheap substitutes by food fraudsters. Kitchen favourite: Popular chefs such as Nigella Lawson, left, and Jamie Oliver, right, often use extra virgin olive oil in their recipes . Just before Christmas one British firm was fined more than £20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as something far more gourmet. Stark Naked Foods claimed its pesto was made with extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese, when in fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper Latvian cheese. In America, a company called Gourmet Factory is facing a lawsuit over its Capatriti brand of ‘100% pure olive oil’. The case is being brought by the North American Olive Oil Association, which claims the product is actually olive pomace oil, a substance extracted using industrial solvents from the solid waste matter from olive oil mills, and not from olives. Last July, Spanish police arrested the leader of a gang responsible for the theft of more than a million litres of the olive oil, which was then shipped to Italy for sale. In 2011, two Spanish businessmen were sent to prison for selling extra virgin olive oil that turned out to be 75per cent sunflower oil. Mr Bayley said consumers need to careful when buying olive oil to make sure they are getting what they expect. ‘If the bottle does not have the words ‘extra virgin’ on it, then it is more than likely a blend containing refined oils,’ he said. ‘There’s a big difference between an extra virgin olive oil and refined olive oils which should cost less. ‘The irony is that highly processed refined oils are often sold in the UK at similar prices to extra virgin which are the least processed and most natural olive oils. ‘No self-respecting Spaniard would pay the same price for refined as extra virgin olive oil.’ Hojiblanca Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the market leader in Spain with around 215,000 tonnes produced every year, which is four times total UK consumption.","Drought in Spain and elsewhere in southern Europe has hit harvest .

"Barack Obama said Monday that it may be time to review a Pentagon program that has placed billions of dollars worth of surplus military gear and equipment in the hands of local police forces since before he became president. The U.S. Defense Department has been . contributing to the militarization of local police forces since at least . 2007, handing over heavy armaments, battle helicopters and armored . vehicles for use in urban policing scenarios. 'I think . it's probably useful for us to review how the funding was done, how . local law enforcement has used grant dollars,' Obama told reporters at the White House, 'to make sure that what . they're purchasing is stuff that they actually need.' 'There is a . big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and . we don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our . tradition,' he said. Last . week's armed confrontations between police and protesters in Ferguson, . Missouri, where an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old, have . ignited a national debate about the militarization of law enforcement . agencies. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Barack Obama put his oar into the national debate over the militarization of local police forces on Monday, saying it may be time for Congress to take a close look at how the Pentagon is giving army gear to law-enforcement personnel . Paramilitary: Police in the newly war-torn Missouri suburb of Ferguson , like many local forces large and small, participates in a federal program that arms them with surplus battlefield weapons, armor and combat vehicles . Not your average riot squad: Ferguson, Mo. police advanced through a cloud of tear gas toward demonstrators protesting the killing of teenager Michael Brown on Sunday night, armed to the teeth and decked out in surplus U.S. Army gear . Obama predicted that 'there will be some bipartisan interest in . re-examining some of those programs,' even while he offered a justification for their existence. 'After . 9/11,' he said, 'I think, understandably, a lot of folks saw local communities that . were ill-equipped for a potential catastrophic terrorist attack.' 'And . then people in Congress, and people of good will decided that we've got . to make sure that they get proper equipment to deal with [it] ... And . some of that's been useful.' But data from the Law Enforcement Support Office of the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency show that the Pentagon transferred ownership of at least . 239,000 items to civilian law enforcement agencies between 2007 and . April of this year. While some of the Pentagon's gifts are as mundane as rubber gloves and . x-ray machines, others include a fleet of $18 million combat helicopters and . 345 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs) worth between . $412,000 and $1.08 million apiece. MRAPs were put into service in the U.S. military to protect personnel from roadside bobs and other improvised explosive devices. The Detroit Free Press first obtained the raw data from the Pentagon through a Freedom of Information Act request, and completed an analysis of equipment gifted to police forces in Michigan. In addition to 17 MRAPs, law enforcement there received 696 model M14 rifles, 32 12-gauge, 'riot-type shotguns' and nine grenade launchers since 2006, according to the paper. But the larger picture shows hundreds of helicopters, including some sophisticated armored models, ending up in the control of local governments. In 2011 the Pentagon gave Brevard County, Florida, a suburban coastal region that includes Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral, ownership of eight choppers valued at $18 million each. Data released by the government don't identify the flying machines by name. But a defense analyst told MailOnline that the per-unit cost 'matches the basic profile of an attack helicopter.' 'There's really no civilian observation chopper on the market that costs that much,' he said. Most of the helicopters described in the data from the Free Press are valued at less than $1 million each, and are identified as 'observation' craft. Standard kit: The Michael Brown shooting's aftermath broughtmilitary arms and vehicles -- not just standard-issue police equipment -- onto the streets of Ferguson . Military weapons and armor have crossed over from Army bases to police barracks tens of thousands of times in the last seven years, including firearms and anti-ambush vehicles . Missouri Highway Patrol, not National Guard: It's getting difficult to tell the two apart . The Brevard County Sheriff's Office operates a small fleet of just three choppers. There at 16 different incorporated towns and cities in the county, but the Pentagon hasn't provided information about which police forces operate those aircraft. More than $45 million worth of rifles – some 89,000 in all, in three calibers – also left the federal government and landed in the trunks of police cruisers. In three U.S. counties, authorities received 13 M59A 'field range' sniper rifles, worth $3,263 each. Police in Covington County, Alabama; Kern County, California and Lee County, Florida were the lucky recipients of those firearms. The latter two are home to the cities of Bakersfield and Fort Myers, respectively. The Defense Department has also donated 9,900 handguns, including more than 400 '.38 special' revolvers. A total of 98 armored vehicles are also on the list – classified as wheeled 'combat / assault / tactical' rides. Perhaps the strangest item migrating from a military base to a police barracks would look more at home in 'Good Morning, Vietnam' than in 'Full Metal Jacket.' Two South Carolina counties got $4 million mobile radio broadcast stations designed to flood enemy territory with propaganda messages. The . 'Special Operations Media System B' (SOMS-B) radio systems consist of . radio and television broadcast stations and antennas mounted on humvees . that tow their own generators. It's 21 tons of gear in all, according to the Department of the Army. In . Afghanistan, according to congressional hearing transcripts, the Army . used SOMS-B systems to broadcast 10,000 watts of propaganda messages . into villages near Bagram Airfield, interspersed with recordings of . Afghan music, sports reports and local news flashes. Not just in Ferguson: Police forces nationwide have requested and been given surplus military hardware to kit their officers out on the job . Sniper rifle: The Pentagon has transferred weapons like this to civilian police forces in several states . Necessary? Critics say even tiny towns are receiving battle gear . Now that the US Army has pulled out of Afghanistan, this MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) armored fighting vehicle could be the very same one seen on Missouri streets . The SOMS-B system can broadcast on any AM, FM, shortwave or television frequency, meaning that the U.S. military could interrupt or overwhelm any broadcast it chose to, replacing it with political messages designed to soften locals' objections and encourage the acceptance of political changes that favored the U.S. mission. It's unclear what authorities in Darlington and Spartanburg Counties intend to use the gear for. The Chicago Tribune reported in 1997, when the SOMS-B platform was first tested, that similar setups had instructed Iraqi soldiers on how to surrender to American troops. They 'can be carried into an area on two C-130 cargo planes, set up and begin broadcasting in about three hours,' according to the Tribune, which called them part of a 'psyops' – psychological operations – approach to warfare.","President said Monday that it's important to make sure police departments are purchasing 'stuff that they actually need'

"A prankster dad may win the award for cruelest joke after he tricked his wife into thinking he threw his toddler son off of the balcony. Roman Atwood set up cameras and enlisted the help of his two sons in an elaborate attempt to frighten his unassuming wife and fool her into thinking he'd accidentally killed their toddler son. The stunt, which was posted on YouTube on November 30 and already has almost 5 million views, begins with Atwood playing with his son, who is dressed in a Spider-Man costume covering his face, on the top floor of their Los Angeles, California home.

Atwood and his son are greeted lovingly by the boy’s mother, who is then sent downstairs 'to grab them some water' so that they can prepare the prank behind her back. Atwood enlists the help of his older son who leads his younger brother into the other room them substitutes the toddler for a dummy, which Atwood then tosses over the railing. His wife runs downstairs and screams in paralyzing fear as she sees the boy falling to the ground below and laying motionless on the ground as though he had died. She unveils the boy's mask to reveal a dummy under the costume and then proceeds to shoot a disgusted glance at her husband. 'Why would you do that?!' she screams still trembling in shock. 'It's just for fun,' Atwood responds as he shrugs his shoulders . She then sentences her husband to a lonely night of sleeping on the couch and gives him a little kick in the groin before she storms out of the room. Petrified: The concerned mother rushes towards the dummy she believes to be her badly injured son . Unmasked: the mother removes the mask to see the damage done and sees  what she thought was her son is nothing more than a dummy .

"Two-thirds of hospitals have sent teams of managers abroad to recruit foreign nurses, an investigation has found. And more than three-quarters are hiring nurses from abroad thanks to staff shortages across the NHS. Many recruit en masse in groups of 30 or 40 at a time from countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. But senior doctors are concerned that the nurses’ poor command of English and potentially inadequate training puts patients at risk. Dr Peter Carter of the Royal College of Nursing said the NHS relies upon hardworking nurses from overseas . The Nursing and Midwifery Council, which regulates nurses, is forbidden from testing those arriving from Europe because EU law states that this would inhibit ‘freedom of movement’. Trusts are increasingly resorting to recruiting nurses from overseas because there are not enough British-trained applicants to fill places. The lack was highlighted last February by a report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, which warned wards across the NHS were desperately understaffed. An investigation by ITV News using responses from 74 hospital trusts found 77 per cent had recruited nurses from abroad since 2010. Two out of three hospitals had sent teams of managers to recruit groups of 30 or 40 at a time at recruitment fairs. The investigation estimated that 31 per cent of nurses working in hospitals in England had trained abroad. At the 64 trusts that were able to give a breakdown of staff members, 36,100 out of 114,669 nurses qualified overseas. The Royal College of Nursing warned recruiting from abroad was an expensive quick fix. Chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: ‘Health care in the UK relies on the hard work and dedication of many nurses who trained overseas, and we must not underestimate their contribution. ‘However it is important that overseas nurses are being employed for the right reasons and in a manageable way. Recruiting from overseas is too often an expensive short-term fix when hospitals realise too late they don’t have enough staff. In the long run, the NHS must ensure that it is training and recruiting enough nurses to meet the needs of patients, and planning for those times when demand is greatest. ‘Without better forward planning, the NHS will spend its money on overseas recruitment at the expense of consistent staffing and high quality care.’ Last month, figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council showed that the number of EU nurses coming to work in Britain had doubled in four years. There are now 20,914 on the register who can work in hospitals and care homes, up from 10,244 in 2010. However, fertility expert Lord Winston expressed concern over some nurses recruited from Eastern Europe . Roger Goss, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘This sort of rise is really alarming. It seems we just aren’t training enough of our own nurses, we ought not to have this reliance on workers coming here from overseas.’ He added: ‘Again and again we have seen concerns about the communication skills of these workers, and communication is absolutely critical when it comes to healthcare.’ Since the NMC is prevented from carrying out tests on nurses before they join the register, it urges hospitals and care homes to do their own checks while interviewing them. But a poll of 100 senior NHS managers in June found that 52 per cent did not normally use aptitude tests when recruiting nurses from the continent. One of Britain’s top doctors, Lord Winston, has expressed particular concern over nurses from Eastern Europe. The peer, a world-renowned fertility expert, warned in 2011 that they had been trained in a ‘completely different way’ to British nurses and were not used to speaking to doctors or even patients. His concerns were echoed by Lord Kakkar, a surgeon, who said: ‘Quite frankly this is an intolerable situation.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Nurses recruited from abroad make a valuable contribution to patient care but they should only work in the NHS if they have the right skills. ‘There are 6,300 more nurses on our wards than in 2010. Trusts are responsible for planning and recruiting their workforce and ensuring they have the appropriate levels of staff.’","NHS hospitals are being forced to send teams to recruit nurses from abroad .

"This was the jaw dropping moment a diver came face-to-face with a behemoth of a crocodile. Fearless John Nygren was swimming in the waters off the south-east coast of Quintana Roo in Mexico when he encountered this prehistoric creature. The reptile seemed as interested in the swimmer as the swimmer was in him and came in really close to investigate the diver and his crew. Make it snappy: John Nygren was swimming in the waters off the south-east coast of Quintana Roo in Mexico when he encountered this prehistoric creature . Touching tail: The diver reaches out and touches the tail of the creature. 'The crocs don't want to risk injury by taking us on,' Mr Nygren said of his encounter with the massive reptiles . Languidly gliding through the clear waters, the crocodile is within touching distance of Mr Ngyren, and seems more curious than threatened by the presence of human beings encroaching its natural habitat. It opens its frightful jaws wide to snap up the bait that divers dangle in front of it, gulping it down within seconds. But as the curios croc investigates the underwater camera, the divers stay close to the dangerous reptile, floating inches from its open mouth. The magnificent creature seems calm and placid, blissfully unbothered by the swimmers surrounding it. At one point the diver reaches out to touch the tail of the creature, holding on to it for a few seconds. Snap happy: The curios croc investigates the underwater camera, poking its snout close to the lens . Head above water: The group followed safety protocols to ensure that they didn't come to any harm . The camera then pans to show another crocodile, swimming up behind the first and the two glorious crocs gracefully slice through the water as their powerful bodies sway. The croc couple swim close together but things start to get aggressive very swiftly when one creature opens its jaws wide and tries to bite the other. But before it can pierce its thick scales, the crocodile snaps back and the aggressor quickly swims away . This particular species, the American crocodile or Crocodylus acutus, is a rare sight in this particular area of Mexico. According to crocodile website crocodilian.com, there have only been 42 American crocodile sightings in Quintana Roo. Mr Ngyren wrote on his Facebook page that the crocodiles would would have tried to have eaten the swimmers, if they had been given a chance . Croc fighting: Things start to get aggressive very swiftly when one creature opens its jaws wide and tries to bite the other . Mr Ngyren, who works for Pinnacle Adventure, wrote about the experience on his Facebook page. 'If given the chance they would maybe try to eat us.

To them we appear larger, taller, and with our huge camera dome ports we theorise they look like a giant intimidating eye. 'The crocs don't want to risk injury by taking us on. If you turn your back on one, put yourself at a disadvantage, stumble and make yourself an easy target, they would immediately lunge and make a meal out of you.

"Upturn: Ryanair has revealed a 32% rise in profits a year after its boss Michael O'Leary promised to stop 'p****** off' passengers . Ryanair's profits have soared by 32 per cent as its loud-mouth boss Michael O'Leary admitted: 'Being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy'. Charging an average of five per cent more for tickets and getting more people on planes also helped push profits to £621million for the six months to the end of September. Ryanair now expects its annual profits of up to £602million, a rise of 18 per cent on a previous estimate . The good news could mean the end of O'Leary's series of extreme schemes to squeeze more money out of passengers, including demanding up to £5 to use the toilet and vertical seats to get more people on board. He said today: 'Being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy for me and Ryanair. Our service left something to be desired 12 months ago. 'It's a new-found experience I must admit for me, but if it works this well I wish I'd been nicer to our customers much earlier. It's better late than never'. Passengers today described his change of heart as the 'slowest penny drop in history'. Earlier this year, after two profits warnings, Mr O'Leary's promised that the company would 'stop unnecessarily p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'. O'Leary agreed to partially end the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £5, relax the airline's draconian baggage allowance rules and a 'sophisticated' business service. It also vowed to cut average fares by up to 10 per cent as part of a bid to fly an additional five million passengers over the winter period. Upward part: Ryanair says profits up because of a new 'touchy feely' attitude to customers and also higher average fares and more people on board . The Dublin-based carrier believes there are 'many opportunities' open to it, such as competing more vigorously at primary airports and in attracting business traffic which tends to travel more during the winter period. Ryanair said average fares will fall by between three per cent and five per cent in the current quarter before an aggressive promotional drive will cut fares by between six per cent and 10 per cent in the new year. As a result, the airline expects to carry 89 million customers in the year to March 31, a rise of 9 per cent on a year earlier and the second such upgrade since September. Average fares will be up by 1 per cent to 47 euros (£36.76) across the year as a result of higher prices over the Easter period. The profits boost came after Ryanair had to give a unprecedented two profits warnings in the past 12 months. Michael O'Leary said to turn them around he would end the airline's 'over-abrupt', 'go to hell' culture. In 2012 he launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers – branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’. Her said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘stupid’ and it is right they are charged £60 a time to have one printed at the check-in desk because it is their ‘f*** up’. Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained areputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair foralmost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinarygrowth . Pay-per-pee . In 2009, Mr O’Leary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight. 'We’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny.' When asked if he would charge more than a pound, he replied: 'If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver.'Vertical seats . A year later, the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats, akin to bar stools with seatbelts. His theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats, flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent. Who needs co-pilots? Mr O'Leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to 'make sure the first fella doesn’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls'. He said aviation authorities should axe the 'unnecessary' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as 'back-up' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight. Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. But in the past 12 months, under pressure over customer service, he has said he wants to change his ways. Last autumn a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers. He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. Many customers told Mr O'Leary what an 'a***hole' they thought he was - with user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'. The Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still love me.' Ryanair remains one of the worst brands in the world by customers, second only to insurance company AXA. Despite recent efforts to transform its reputation, the budget airline was one of the worst-performing brands overall in Siegel+Gale's 2014 simplicity index. In a survey of over 12,000 customers in eight countries, Ryanair was named the second worst-ranked brand, based on ease of customer use of a company's products, services, interactions and communications.","Ryanair's profits for the six months to September up 32% to £621million .

"On the town: Liverpool University students enjoying a Carnage event with a Playboy v Bunny Girl theme . Police will today issue an unprecedented plea for moderation in drinking as they admit defeat in tackling Britain’s excessive boozing culture. The country’s most senior officer responsible for fighting alcohol-related crime called for an end to the attitude which tolerates out-of-control drunkenness as ‘normal’. Chief Constable Adrian Lee also admitted officers’ efforts to combat booze-fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘barely scratched the surface’ of a problem that is ‘blighting our communities’. Last year, Mr Lee called for the installation of drunk tanks on the streets to mop up some of the mess caused by the UK’s failed 24-hour drinking experiment. Today, he will say that despite officers’ best efforts there had been ‘few changes’ in 12 months. In a 24-hour period measured by Mr Lee’s own force, Northamptonshire, more than one in four incidents reported to police were related to alcohol. He will also call for much tougher action against the alcohol industry, a clampdown on cheap booze and more action to combat criminals with alcohol problems. And he will say: ‘But there is only so much progress we can make without individuals taking personal responsibility for their drinking. ‘Social tolerance for excessive drinking is far too great and it is considered normal to be so drunk that people are not in control of themselves. ‘This puts an enormous burden on police and health services and affects the service we offer to the public.’ This weekend will see a campaign of action against public drunkenness across the country. It could mean drunks being refused entry to pubs and clubs if they fail a compulsory breathalyser test. A breathalyser scheme – which is in operation at student venues in Loughborough – will see anyone considered too drunk when they arrive at a venue turned away on the basis of their alcohol reading. It is designed to tackle ‘pre-loading’, people drinking substantial quantities of cheap supermarket booze before going out on the town. Elsewhere, officers will issue ‘yellow card’ style warnings to people who are drunk, who will then be forced to leave the town or city centre if they do not control their behaviour. Officers will also visit schools and university campuses to give alcohol awareness lessons to both school age pupils and students who are beginning freshers’ week. Police have admitted efforts to combat booze-fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘barely scratched the surface’ of a problem that is ‘blighting our communities’ The police action was backed by academics who called for officers to set up ‘booze borders’ around city centres, refusing entry to anyone who is very drunk – or making them sober up. Jonathan Birdwell, of think-tank Demos, said: ‘We need a tougher and smarter approach in those specific places that have big issues with problem drinking and where our current strategies aren’t working. ‘This includes giving drunk and disorderly people entering city centres a “yellow card” and denying them entry – or forcing them to sober up for an hour in a drunk tank.’ Twenty-four-hour drinking, brought in by Labour under Tony Blair, was opposed by the Daily Mail with support from senior police, ambulance staff and judges. Supporters claimed the move would bring a peaceful, continental-style drinking culture to the UK. But police have said round-the-clock opening had caused ‘significant problems’, and anyone put in a tank should be charged up to £400 a night, including a £100 on-the-spot fine.","Police admit defeat in tackling Britain's excessive boozing culture .

"Ring master? Federal officials are looking into the possible existence of a pedophile ring involving convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky . A man has come forward alleging he saw Jerry Sandusky and a prominent Penn State University donor sexually abusing two boys together aboard a private plane, it was claimed on Monday. The FBI is reportedly taking the accusations 'seriously,' and has opened an investigation into a pedophile sex ring that could spread beyond the former Penn State football coach. Until now, authorities have believed that Sandusky was a lone abuser. The newest allegations threaten bring out more horrifying revelations about sexual abuse surrounding the once-prestigious college athletics program. RadarOnline.com reports that the witness, who has business ties to the Penn State booster, told postal inspectors and the FBI that he was aboard the private plane when the alleged abuse occurred. He said he remained silent about what he saw until now and does not know whether the boys are new victims or if they have already been identified as having been abused by the former defensive coordinator. 'If the Feds can prove what this witness is saying then a sickening situation just got worse,' an anonymous source told Radar. 'The witness does not know who the boys are and if they were from Sandusky's Second Mile charity. He can prove his tie to the booster but the Feds are going to have to prove the rest.' According to Radar Online, federal authorities are looking into the possibility that Sandusky shared his young victims with other pedophiles including a 'very rich, very powerful man connected with the university.' Grave allegations: Sources close to the investigation say a prominent man with close ties to Penn State may have been involved in the alleged sex ring . University boosters used to be content cheering for their college sports team and organizing fundraisers. However, in recent years, wealthy donors have been more active in major university athletics. In many cases, their money buys them access to coaches and players and influence the decisions of university administrators. In years past, scandal has erupted at other universities when boosters have used their cash and power to woo college players with cars, cash and other gifts. Until now, authorities have always thought Jerry Sandusky did his terrible deeds alone. However, the new allegations threaten to widen the horrific scandal -- possibly implicating a wealthy donor in sex abuse itself. University officials, including legendary coach Joe Paterno himself, have been accused of covering up and not acting on allegations that Sandusky was abusing young boys. Only Sandusky, though, has been accused of committing the actual abuse. In June, Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for the Penn State football team, was convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse for molesting 10 boys. Prosecutors say Sandusky met his victims at the Second Mile, a charity he founded for under-privileged children. Sandusky has not cooperated with authorities and has denied he ever sexually abused children. Investigators with the US Postal Service are also examining Sandusky. They have seized his computers and are looking into allegations that he sent 'seductive letters' across state lines -- including to some of his victims. Federal investigators are currently working to verify the allegations against the booster, who remains unnamed. The alleged witness reportedly included specific information like times and places. Radar Online said investigators were starting with the known victims because the eyewitness didn't know who the boys were. 'This . interview did not take place in the state of Pennsylvania and there are . documents linking the eyewitness to the man he claims abused children . with Sandusky. There is enough evidence that this is being taken very, . very seriously.' The booster allegedly involved with . Sandusky is described as a 'very rich and powerful man connected with . the university,' Radar reports. The news comes a little over a month . after Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 counts of child sexual abuse for . molesting 10 boys over the course of 15 years. The United States Postal Inspectors . office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has spearheaded the investigation . because pornographic materials involving underage boys . have allegedly been sent through the mail. Analyzing . a computer seized from Sandusky, investigators are also looking into . whether he sent ‘seductive letters’ across state lines for sexual . purposes, according to CBS. Some of these letters were said to be sent to some of his . victims. Tensions: Paterno hardly got along with his former assistant Jerry Sandusky, left, even before allegations of child sex abuse were raised . In custody: Sandusky's attorneys have indicated that they will appeal his conviction . ‘The investigation . is in its early stages,’ the source added. ‘They have not yet cast a . wide net but it is ongoing and it is serious.’ Sandusky is expected to be sentenced . to a life in prison for sexually abusing underage boys. Many of the . victims came from the Second Mile charity, which Sandusky founded in . 1977 to help troubled youth. Penn State representatives were not immediately available to comment on the investigation. Meanwhile, a status conference has . been scheduled for September 7 in a Pennsylvania courtroom as Second . Mile seeks to shut down and transfer its assets. Sandusky’s charity is hoping to give . its assets to Houston-based Arrow Child & Family Ministries Inc., . but lawyers for some of the child abuse victims have objected. With Sandusky facing 442 years . in prison, his legal team has raised an argument about the disgraced . ex-Penn State football coach’s speedy trial that may become the thrust . of an appeal.","FBI is investigating whether Sandusky 'shared boys with a wealthy backer of the football program'

"Tony Hogue, sene here in an undated modeling photo, has come forward to tell the story of how he once banged down Bill Cosby's door after receiving a phone call from his friend who believed she was drugged and trapped inside the comedian's home in 1984 . A former male model has become the first man to come forward with a story that corroborates a Cosby accuser's claims about the actor's alleged abuse. Tony Hogue, now 58, worked as a model in a 1980s -- for the same agency that represented Cosby accuser Beth Ferrier -- and says he spent two drunken evenings at Cosby's Manhattan brownstone in 1984 along with Ferrier and another model friend. After he declined a third debaucherous dinner at Cosby's home and his fellow models attended without him, Hogue says he got an unsettling phone call from his unnamed friend from inside the house after she believes she was drugged by the comedian. That friend would go on to become a witness called Jane Doe 8 in Andrea Constand's 2005 sexual assault lawsuit against Cosby, which never went to trial. She, along with Hogue, separately recounted their stories from 1984 to the Daily Beast. 'She was crying. She was hysterical. She was whispering,' Hogue recalled to the Daily Beast. 'She said, ""Tony, you've got to come get me.""' Hogue told the site he had been working for the modeling agency JF Images, an agency with reported ties to Cosby, when he was flown to New York City for work. He said he and his fellow models were invited to dine with the actor at his Upper East Side brownstone on tony 61st street twice. 'Why would Bill Cosby care less about these young girls coming from these modeling agencies? That was how he was casting extras on his show? 'That right there seemed ridiculous. I’d been to LA, and no actors I knew were doing that kind of stuff,' Hogue remembers wondering. Scene: Hogue says his unnamed friend, who worked with him at JF Images--a  modeling agency with purported ties to Cosby--called him in a daze from inside Cosby's Manhattan brownstone (pictured) in 1984 . Cosby was at the cusp of breaking out as America's most beloved TV dad in 1984 when Hogue says he and his model agency friends were invited to his New York City home several time. Hogue says the night his friends went without him is when things took a turn . After an uncomfortable experience in which he claims Cosby first tried setting him up with a married female pilot--and another when he says Cosby very pointedly made clear he was his home's Alpha Dog--Hogue chose to turn down a third invitation to dine with Cosby. While Hogue stayed in at the JF Images apartment some twenty blocks away, his friend and Beth Ferrier again went to Cosby's. The friend recalled her night at the brownstone to the Daily Beast. 'Perrier Jouet was served like water,' said the woman, who's now 53 and a successful business owner in Colorado. 'We were all young—in our twenties—and felt honored to be having dinner with Cosby,' she said, but then she said he tried to kiss her and things took a turn. 'I called Tony to come get me,' she said. 'This was after Cosby tried to kiss me. I was amazed, and quite disgusted (since he was close to my Dad’s age and smelled like a cigar). 'I do recall that I felt out of control.' Concerned both about how strung out his friend seemed on the phone and with what would become of him, a nobody, if he came barging into a superstar's home, Hogue told the Daily Beast he knew he had to help his friend. Another model: Former model Beth Ferrier (right and left) also worked for JF Images and years ago admitted she had an affair with Cosby after meeting him with Hogue and his friend after they were invited to Cosby's home for a night of dinner and boozing. She's also accused Cosby of drugging and assaulting her . Both Ferrier and Hogue's friend were named as Jane Doe witnesses in Andrea Constand's (pictured) case against Cosby, but never testified . 'I just started kicking [the door] and pounding it,' Hogue recalled. 'I made quite a racket. I wanted to get in.' When Cosby finally answered, Hogue said he seemed unfazed by his apparent intrusion and merely asked what the problem was. 'There’s a big problem here,' Hogue said. 'Those girls are going with me right now!' He claims went into the house and eventually found his friend clothed but disheveled and practically incoherent. 'After Tony collected me,' the friend told the Daily Beast, 'I was virtually incoherent. At the time, I was in a long-term relationship, but remember (with shame) that I called out for Tony after returning to the company apartment. To this day, I am still embarrassed by my behavior.' Hogue said he never saw Ferrier at the home and they left without her that night. Ferrier has since gone public about what she called her brief affair with Cosby when she was a model in 1984. She said that he once drugged her coffee during an encounter in Denver and that she woke up hours later in the backseat of her car with her clothes disheveled. Ferrier would also go on to become Jane Doe 5 in Andrea Constand's case. Cosby in recent weeks has been accused of drugging and sexually assaulting more than a dozen women over many years. Cosby has strongly denied wrongdoing and has never been criminally charged. A suburban Philadelphia prosecutor declined to press charges in Constand's case. Cosby testified in Constand's case that he gave the National Enquirer an exclusive interview about the suit in exchange for the tabloid spiking a story about Beth Ferrier.

"Britain has been left with just one deep-pit coal mine after the Government has announced that two of the last three sites are set to close. Ministers have decided there was 'no case for investment' and have agreed to a £10 million . loan, alongside £10 million from the private sector, to  'manage the closure' of the mines. The sites - at Kellingley in North Yorkshire and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire - were once bustling, employing around 2,000 each. The closure of the mines, operated by Britain’s largest coal producer, UK Coal, will see the loss of 1,300 jobs. It seems the mining industry is on the brink of extinction after the Government announced two of the three last remaining mines are to be wound down by autumn 2015 - including Thoresby Colliery (pictured) Ministers have decided there was 'no case for investment' and have agreed to a £10 million loan, alongside £10 million from the private sector, to  'manage the closure' of the mines . The sites - at Kellingley in North Yorkshire and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire - were once bustling, employing around 2,000 each. Today the sites, operated by Britain's largest coal producer, UK Coal, employ 1,300 people . But now it seems the mining industry is . on the brink of extinction after the Government announced they are to be wound down by autumn 2015. The Government's move to manage the closure, spares the company the prospect of immediate insolvency which would have cost the Treasury 'significant losses and liabilities' from redundancies and unpaid taxes. In a written statement to MPs, energy minister Michael Fallon said: 'The taxpayer is better served by supporting a managed closure of the mines. The Government's move to manage the closure, spares the company the prospect of immediate insolvency which would have cost the Treasury 'significant losses and liabilities' from redundancies and unpaid taxes . People gather at the entrance to Kellingley Colliery in 2011, where two men became trapped in debris inside the North Yorkshire pit . 'However, deep coal mining remains an inherently risky business. There is no value for money case for a level of investment that would keep the deep mines open beyond this managed wind-down period to autumn 2015. 'Private sector investors who wish to put in the substantial investment that would be needed to maintain the mines beyond autumn 2015 without government support remain free to do so.' Mr Fallon said the Government intended to participate in a private sector-led consortium 'to avoid the immediate insolvency of UK Coal'. The proposal, which ministers have . been considering since March 21, would see the deep pits face a phased . shutdown and UK Coal’s six surface mines sold off. Mr . Fallon told MPs that the Government’s agreement to participate was . subject to final terms 'that provide adequate protection to taxpayers' as well as assurance of backing from all parties including trade unions. He said a 'rapid response service' would be available to help employees try to find new work and retraining. Thoresby Colliery, Nottinghamshire, was the site of rioting in 1984 after a worker was killed . A lone miner passes a line of police outside Thoresby Colliery, Nottinghamshire, to go to work . Miners at Creswell Colliery, Nottinghamshire, pictured in 1947 . Mr Fallon said directors of UK Coal had approached the Government at the end of January to report that a falling coal price, exchange rates and other factors meant that 'the viability of the business was potentially in doubt'. It is understood that private sector investment will come from rival mining group Hargreaves Services and Harworth Estates, landlord of the two mines. Mr Fallon said in a separate statement: 'We are doing everything we can to help in this unique situation. 'Our commercial loan, as part of this private sector-led initiative, can support a managed closure that is in the best interests of the taxpayer and employees. The only alternative was immediate insolvency. 'It has been a real collective effort to get to this point, but this remains a challenging situation and all parties need to continue working closely together.' Coal distribution in England, Wales and Scotland . Britain's coal industry was once the biggest employer in the country, when the pits were at the centre of communities whose way of life revolved around them. The hard but honourable work, at its peak - when coal was king - employed around 1 million people. By the time Labour nationalised the industry in 1947, it still employed 750,000 people. But the consumption of domestic coal began to fall with the discovery of North Sea gas. Soon the country's mining pits were closing down at an alarming rate. When widespread industrial action was triggered in March 1984 by plans to close 20 loss-making pits, there were 180 pits, each employing around 1,000 workers. Today there are three deep pit coal mines and six surface sites. The Government's announcement today looks set to sever one of Britain's last remaining links with it's once thriving industrial past.","Sites at Kellingley, North Yorkshire and Thoresby, Nottinghamshire to close .

"Migration will form a virtual mega-city stretching . through Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, . Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland and ending in the capital Washington . D.C. Vast swathes of the U.S. countryside are emptying and communities becoming ghost towns as rural America now only accounts for just 16 per cent of the population. The 2010 census results suggest that by 2050 many of these areas could shrink to virtually nothing as businesses collapse and schools close. This dramatic population implosion is the culmination of a century of migration to cities, as in 1910 the share of rural America was at 72 per cent. Blackout: This official graphic shows dominant U.S. urban areas, marked in white, while large swathes of rural areas are becoming darker as people move away . In 1950 the countryside remained home to a majority of Americans, amid post-World War II economic expansion and the baby boom. However, once busy areas have been abandoned, in South Dakota for example, the town of Scenic is up for sale for $799,000 as today just eight people live there. Overall the share of people in rural areas over the past decade fell to 16 percent, passing the previous low of 20 percent in 2000, and is expected to drop further because of the economic crisis. But in contrast American cities are booming and will continue to swallow suburban communities, producing a virtual mega-city stretching through Boston, Massachusetts, through New York City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland and ending in the capital Washington, D.C. 'Some of the most isolated rural areas face a major uphill battle, with a broad area of the country emptying out,' said Mark Mather, associate vice president of the Population Reference Bureau, a research group in Washington, D.C. 'Many rural areas can't attract workers because there aren't any jobs, and businesses won't relocate there because there aren't enough qualified workers. So they are caught in a downward spiral.' The rural share is expected to drop further as the U.S. population balloons from 309 million to 400 million by 2050, leading even more people to crowd cities and suburbs and fill in the land around them. Ghost town: Scenic South Dakota was once a thriving train stop, complete with a saloon, and two jails, but now all the businesses are closed and eight people live there . In 2010, the census found cities grew overall by 11 percent with the biggest gains in suburbs or small- or medium-sized cities. In fact, of the 10 fastest-growing places, all were small cities incorporated into the suburbs of expanding metro areas, mostly in California, Arizona and Texas. In all, the share of Americans living in suburbs has climbed to an all-time high of 51 percent. Despite sharp declines in big cities in the Northeast and Midwest since 2000 due to the recession, U.S. cities increased their share by 3 percent to a third. The data was supplemented with calculations by Robert Lang, a sociology professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, and William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.

In the census 'rural' is generally defined as non-metropolitan areas with fewer than 50,000 people. 'These new patterns suggest that there will be a blurring of boundaries as regions expand well beyond official government-defined definitions,' Mr Frey said. 'People like to have it all - affordable housing in a smaller-town setting but in close proximity to jobs and big-city amenities such as specialised shopping, cultural events and major sports and entertainment venues.' Areas areas like the Great Plains in the central U.S. and Appalachia in the East, along with parts of the South and Texas, could face the most significant population declines, demographers say. These places suffered some of the biggest losses over the past decade as young adults left and the people who stayed got older, moving past childbearing years. Rural towns are scrambling to attract new residents and stave off heavy funding cuts from financially strapped federal and state governments. Delta Air Lines recently announced it would end flight service to 24 small airports, several of them in the Great Plains, and the U.S. The U.S. Postal Service is mulling plans to close thousands of branches in mostly rural areas of the country.

Many rural areas, the central Great Plains in particular, have been steadily losing population since the 1930s with few signs of the trend slowing in coming decades.

It was he Stacie called in March when she received the unfathomable news that she was pregnant after years of thinking she was infertile. 'You're not going to believe this,' the mother-to-be had told him in a mixture of laughter and tears, according to The Oklahoman. But over the next days and weeks, as she shopped for all the things her baby would need, a serious worry began to gnaw at Stacie. She was having severe headaches and double vision, while tremors struck every inch of her body. She began to tell Ray of her growing concerns. 'I'm worried about this baby,' she said in one text, according to the Oklahoman. 'I hope I live long enough to have this baby,' said another message. 'Bubba, if anything happens to me, you take this child.' Stacie was no longer with the father of the baby and would have raised her daughter as a single mother if she survived. At her family's encouragement, Stacie visited a number of doctors and in July, a CT scan revealed that she had head and neck cancer. Emotional: The moment Stacie was able to meet her baby daughter before she passed away. Also pictured are her siblings Ray and Elizabeth . Tiny: Dottie Mae was delivered four months early by Caesarean section, weighing just 2lbs 1oz . She had to do what no would-be mother should have to - choose between her life and that of her baby's. It was an easy decision. Ray told the Oklahoman that his sister waived the potentially lifesaving chemotherapy in the hope that she would eventually hold a healthy baby in her arms. Then on August 16, Stacie collapsed at her home in Ryan, Oklahoma and was rushed to OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City. Doctors said the invasive tumour had begun wrapping around the brain stem, the Oklahoman reported. Two days later the baby's heart rate plummeted, then Stacie's heart stopped. Code Blue was issued. Doctors and nurses rushed to her aid and decided a C-section was the baby's only chance. Dottie Mae arrived into the world weighing less than a third of an average newborn. She was swiftly taken to neonatal intensive care, while her mother was placed in intensive care in another building. 'Sister was dying right there. She was gasping,' Ray told the Oklahoman. 'The human body fights death.' Stacie fought back and managed to wrestle herself off the ventilator and sedation after a few days. 'There was still a lot of hope at that point,' said Ray's wife Jennifer. Loving mother: Dottie Mae was able to meet her mother before Stacie died three days later on September 11 . Part of the family: Stacie's brother Ray Phillips has taken Dottie Mae into his home with his four children after the baby's father left his sister . But the cancer had affected one of her eyes and destroyed the muscle behind it, . It had paralysed her throat so that when she did talk, she was hard to understand. She had tumours on her brain. She often became unconscious and had not been able to sign Dottie Mae's birth certificate. Stacie was too weak to be taken to her baby, and her baby was too weak to be brought to her. 'We'd show her pictures and she would cry and she would want to hold her baby,' Ray told NewsOk. 'It was quite the ordeal. I felt helpless. I wanted to help her, I wanted to do what I could for her - we all did - but they had told us it was impossible for her to see the child.' On September 8, Stacie stopped breathing and once again was resuscitated. Hospital staff warned the family that she was very close to death. But she had not yet held, kissed or looked into the blue eyes of the baby whose life she had chosen above her own. Nurse Agi Beo, herself a mother, could not bear to think of Stacie's emotional pain and decided to do something about it. She worked with nurse Jetsy Jacob and talked to Neoflight, the medical centre's neonatal transport team, about using a capsule-like ICU to safely move Dottie Mae to her mother. Special unit: Dottie Mae had to be transferred into an ICU module so she could be taken from intensive care to her mother . 'I knew all of this was going on in the background and I didn't say nothing to her until I knew it was going to happen because I didn't want to get her hopes up,' Ray said. He asked his sister what she would would think about seeing her daughter that day. Stacie's eyes popped open and she began looking around to find her. Soon the nurses arrived with Dottie Mae and laid her right on her mother's chest. The two stared into each other's eyes for several minutes. 'Nobody said anything, it got real quiet,' Ray told NewsOk. 'I told my sister, ""You have done a beautiful thing"". It was the perfect moment, that's what I called it.' Stacie died three days later. Her funeral was on September 14. Her obituary on the Dudley Funeral Homes website reads: 'Dottie Mae was the light of her life and her greatest accomplishment. She chose to give this baby life instead of taking treatment for herself.' Dottie Mae now lives with Ray, his wife Jennifer and their four children in their Oklahoma City home . 'I think she's a miracle. I just want to do right by her and do what Stacie asked,' Jennifer said.","Stacie Crimm gave birth by Caesarian on August 18 as heart rate plummeted .

"Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson may have been showing symptoms of the deadly virus as early as last Friday - before she flew to Ohio for the weekend and then back to Texas. The CDC made the shocking announcement on Thursday, after Miss Vinson was revealed as the second medical worker in Dallas to contract Ebola from the U.S.'s 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan. On October 10, Miss Vinson, 29, may have had Ebola symptoms when she flew out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 to Cleveland to plan her upcoming wedding, a health official said today. Scroll down for video . Amber Vinson, 29, is feared to have been exhibiting Ebola symptoms as early as Friday before she took her flight out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to Cleveland, Ohio . Coming Attractions bridal store in Cleveland Ohio. The store has voluntarily shut after Miss Vinson went to the store with five of her friends . A view of some of the offerings inside Coming Attractions, where Miss Vinson went bridesmaid shopping this weekend . Police have taped off a home in Tallmadge, Ohio which belongs to the mother of Ebola patient Amber Vinson . CDC Dr Chris Braden said during a press briefing on Thursday: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday. 'This has to do with the bridal shop. Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.' Seven people in Cleveland and Akron have put themselves in voluntary quarantine after coming into contact with Miss Vinson, including five friends whom she shopped with for bridesmaid dresses at bridal store, Coming Attractions, in Cleveland. The news has prompted high schools and medical centers in Ohio to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with the nurse. Miss Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with  friends - but authorities are pressing her further on her movements. The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk. The owner of the store told Newsnet5 that Miss Vinson didn't seem sick  when she visited to pick out dresses. The 29-year-old is now being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition. Co-workers help a hazmat worker disrobe on Thursday after coming out of The Village Bend East apartment where a second healthcare worker who has tested positive for the Ebola virus resides in Dallas . A timeline of Ebola patient's Thomas Duncan and the two nurses, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson who contracted the virus while caring for him . Miss Vinson was taken by chartered plane from Dallas to Atlanta Wednesday night, where she is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital . She was airlifted from Dallas, Texas on Wednesday evening on a specialized plane with quarantine unit, along with medical staff in hazmat suits. Miss Vinson was one of the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to treat Duncan when he was admitted a second time on September 28, in the first 'high-risk' days when there is a high volume of bodily fluids from projectile vomiting, bleeding and explosive diarrhea. According to CDC guidelines, the nurse should have limited her movements. It is not clear if Miss Vinson called the CDC before boarding her flight from Dallas to Cleveland. One and two: Miss Vinson contracted the disease after treating America's Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan (left). The 29-year-old bride-to-be was the second nurse who treated Duncan to come down with the virus. The first nurse diagnosed was 26-year-old Nina Pham (right) who was in 'good condition' at Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday . Damage control: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is currently monitoring more than 75 health care workers who came into contact with Duncan during his stay. On Wednesday, the hospital announced it would be offering free rooms to these staff members, who may not want to risk infecting their family members . Before her return flight on Monday, the nurse noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane. When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold. CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden admits that was the wrong call. Dr Frieden also noted that Miss Vinson had flown to Ohio before the first nurse with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham from Fort Worth, was diagnosed with the virus. Miss Pham was described as being in a 'good condition' today. She is being transferred to a special isolation ward at the National Institutes of Health Hospital in Maryland. The Frontier Airlines plane that Amber Vinson flew from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday, flies out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on Wednesday. It emerged today that Miss Vinson may have been showing symptoms on her inbound flight to Cleveland .","The CDC made the shocking announcement on Thursday after Miss Vinson was revealed as the second medical worker in Dallas to contract Ebola .

"Former England boss Terry Venables has called on Premier League managers to stop interfering with the selection of their top international stars. Liverpool have been in the spotlight recently after media reports suggested  Brendan Rodgers asked Roy Hodgson to rest Raheem Sterling for England's Euro 2016 qualifying fixture against Estonia last week. Rodgers denied those claims and played down any club-versus-country row, but writing in the Independent on Sunday, Venables said Hodgson should not have to consult Premier League managers when selecting players. Former England assistant manager Terry Venables (pictured next to Steve McClaren) has told Premier League managers to let Roy Hodgson decide who is selected for the national team . Venables was in charge of the England national senior team between 1994 and 1996 . Brendan Rodgers and Roy Hodgson have clashed over the handling of Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling . 'I am sick of Premier League managers dictating who should, or who shouldn't, play for England,' writes Venables. 'Country comes before club, end of. 'There are no conversations to be had with club managers trying to stop England picking their players. 'When I became England manager I never experienced any player saying to me: thanks for picking me boss but I don't fancy it this time, maybe next game perhaps,' wrote the 71-year-old. 'If I had, then that player would never, ever, have been part of my England squad again, no matter how important he could have been. 'To be selected for England is the ultimate accolade. I was the first footballer to play for England at every level possible - schoolboy, youth, amateur, under-23 (as it was then) and full. Liverpool boss Rodgers believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently . 'Can you imagine how proud I feel today just thinking about that? Nothing would have stopped me playing in any of those games.' Venables, who guided England to the semi-finals of Euro 1996 where they were knocked out on penalties by Germany, said he never came under pressure from managers during his two-year spell in charge. 'I never tolerated a situation where managers were telling me publicly who I could, or could not, select,' the former Tottenham Hotspur manager added. 'That would have totally undermined my position and made the job of running England impossible.'","Former England boss Terry Venables believes international football is just as important as the Premier League .

"Firms bidding for government contracts will have to offer higher wages to their lowest-paid staff under Labour plans. Ed Miliband is expected to announce at Labour’s conference next week that firms seeking government work will have to pay the so-called ‘living wage’, which is more than £1 an hour higher than the national minimum wage. The move is the centrepiece of a package which will also see significant increases in the minimum wage, and a new formula to prevent it falling behind inflation. Ed Miliband is expected to announce at Labour’s conference next week that firms seeking government work will have to pay the ‘living wage’ Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves last night said some employers were already paying the living wage. She said: ‘I want to use those examples of best practice in the public and private sectors to determine how a future Labour Government would act, and that would mean over time having public sector procurement requiring paying a living wage. ‘That’s something we’re looking at for the manifesto. And it’s something that Ed feels very strongly about.’ The national minimum wage stands at £6.50 an hour. The living wage is significantly higher at £7.65 an hour, up to £8.80 in London. Senior Labour figures have been trying to drum up business support for a big increase in the minimum wage ahead of next week’s conference in Manchester. Mr Miliband’s adviser on the issue, Alan Buckle, has launched a discreet bid to persuade business leaders to sign an open letter backing the idea. The letter says that ‘as the economy recovers, we believe the minimum wage should rise faster than it has in the recent past. A stronger minimum wage will benefit businesses, improve public finances and help tackle low pay’. It makes no mention of a specific figure, but Labour is thought to be considering boosting the minimum wage to £7 an hour. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves last night said some employers were already paying the living wage . Miss Reeves told The House magazine: ‘I do think there’s scope for increasing the value of the national minimum wage. I think it’s fallen in real terms by 5 per cent since the last general election. I would like to see at least that value restored.’ Miss Reeves also sought to toughen Labour’s rhetoric on the issue of migrants claiming benefits, saying decisions on benefits should be set by Parliament, not Brussels. She said: ‘I don’t think it’s right that someone should be able to come to this country and be able to start claiming benefits on day one. Or that they should be able to claim child benefit for children living overseas.’ ‘All countries in the European Union have their own welfare states and welfare is supposed to be an issue of national sovereignty, so we should be able to make decisions about how our welfare state works.’ Tory MP Brian Binley, a member of the Commons business select committee, said politicians should be ‘very wary’ of imposing big wage increases on employers. Mr Binley said: ‘They need to be very careful about this, and think about the impact on jobs. Most small business I know want to pay people the best wage they can because it is the best way to keep good people. But ultimately they can only pay what they can afford. ‘I would also be worried that a move of this kind could make it harder for small firms to win Government contracts at a time when we want more of them involved.’","Ed Miliband is expected to announce the changes at conference next week .

"Singer Ricki-Lee Coulter has revealed how her difficult early childhood is behind her decision not to have children with fiance Richard Harrison. Speaking to radio hosts Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald and Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli on Nova FM on Wednesday, the performer said being 'dumped' with relatives while her mother, Loretta Sheerin, went out meant she was left looking after younger members of the family instead. 'I'm the eldest of like 30 grandchildren, my mum is one of like, fifty thousand kids. I was the eldest of all these grandkids and I was the one looking after them,' revealed the 28-year-old. 'My mum had me when she was really young and so I was dumped with whoever aunty or friend or cousin who would take me while she went out partying, being an 18-year-old.' Scroll down for video . Mother and daughter: The 28-year-old singer said her difficult upbringing as the daughter of a single parent - her mother, Loretta Sheerin - influenced her decision not to have children . Happy Ever After: Ricki-Lee Coulter is engaged to personal trainer Richard Harrison, today revealing live on Fitzy and Wippa's Wednesday Nova FM show they're not planning children . The singer's parents separated early and Ricki-Lee was initially raised solely by her mother when the pair moved from New Zealand to the Gold Coast, leaving her father in New Zealand. Loretta, who is of Maori descent, worked hard to make ends meet, juggling two jobs. Eventually Loretta married her Scottish husband John, and had two more children - Jodie, now 25, and two-year-old Emily. The dedicated mother enjoys a close relationship with her famous daughter - Ricki Lee recently posting an image of the pair of them together on Instagram - while the siblings are also tight-knit. Now, performer Ricki-Lee says her strong feelings about remaining childless may have led in part to the breakdown of her own first marriage, to Gold Coast builder Jamie Babbington in 2007. The union only lasted just over one year. 'The hard thing was I got married, stupidly, when I was 21 and he really wanted them [kids],' she revealed. 'And I felt that pressure of him wanting to have kids, and that maybe I was going to change how I felt about it and the things that I wanted to in with my life, to make him happy. 'My ex wanted like seven kids, and I was like, 'Come on girlfriend. Not a chance. Have a great time finding someone to have seven kids with you!' First love: Ricki-Lee Coulter married builder Jamie Babbington in 2007 but the union only just lasted over a year . No date yet! The New Zealand born songstress revealed that the couple have yet to set a date but said 'there's no rush' The Australian Idol finalist is now engaged to her personal trainer beau Rich Harrison, who she says she met 'when he walked in the door and I was standing on the table sculling a jug of beer!' 'It was classy and romantic.' The pair share the same view about starting a family, with Ricki-Lee confessing she is so clear about her feelings the couple discussed their views on their very first official date. 'It was one of our first dates,' she told Fitzy and Wippa, 'and I think he brought it up and I was like, ""Oh thank god!""' We are family: Ricki-Lee often posts social media updates about her young sister Emily, believed to be aged 2 . Queen of the airwaves: Ricki Lee herself was a breakfast host om Nova 96.9 in 2010 . 'He's just always known that he never wants them.' The revelations were sparked when the radio hosts challenged Ricki-Lee to completes a sentence as as if it was part of her wedding speech. After the hosts said, 'Today is a memory that I will cherish for the rest of my life so thank you for being here, the reason that I have such faith in my future marriage to Rich is that we both have...' Ricki-Lee responded: 'We both don't want kids,' later explaining: 'I don't know whether it's my experience as a kid, but I know how crazy my life is and how all over the place it is,and you have to be selfish to do what I do. 'I have so much respect for people who actually do do it but I wouldn't want to put a kid through what I went through.' Strong bond: Richard and Ricki-Lee are engaged but have not yet set a date or made any wedding plans . The Bling Ring: Richard proposed to Ricki-Lee in January 2013 after two years together . Comfortable lifestyle: The singer says Richard first met her when she was standing on a table and chugging beer . The Brand New Day songstress went on to say that while she's relieved her and Rich have the same perspective having children, she would never say never. 'I feel like it's a blessing in disguise, but it's a great thing that both of us are on the same page with it and no-one has to compromise - and you never know I might turn 40 go, 'All right come on! Let's pop one out.' The couple have been together since 2009 and engaged since January 2013, but have yet to set a wedding date. 'We don't have anything planned,' she told the radio show. 'There's no rush.' Big sister: The star, seen here with her sister at the Lion King, said she grew up looking after younger children .

"Many scientists believe it takes several decades for the effects of global warming to be felt on Earth. But in fact, it takes just 10 years for a single emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) to have its maximum warming effects on the planet. This is according to Washington-based researchers who claim to have dispelled a common misconception that the damaging effects from a CO2 emission will only be felt by future generations. Scroll down for video . It takes just 10 years for a single emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) to have its maximum warming effects on the Earth, according to a new study by the Carnegie Institute for Science in Washington. Pictured is the average global surface temperatures in 2013. Red and dark orange show warmer-than-average temperatures . The results suggest that warming can persist for more than a century and that the benefits from emission reductions will be felt by those who have worked to curb the emissions. Some of these benefits would be the avoidance of extreme weather events, such as droughts, heatwaves and flooding, according to scientists at the Carnegie Institute for Science. However, some of the bigger climate impacts from warming, such as sea-level rise, melting ice sheets and long-lasting damage to ecosystems, may not occur for hundreds or thousands of years later, they claim. 'Amazingly, despite many decades of climate science, there has never been a study focused on how long it takes to feel the warming from a particular emission of carbon dioxide, taking carbon-climate uncertainties into consideration,' said lead author of the study Dr Katharine Ricke. The study suggests that warming from CO2 emissions can persist for more than a century and that the benefits from emission reductions will be felt by those who have worked to curb the emissions . 'A lot of climate scientists may have an intuition about how long it takes to feel the warming from a particular emission of CO2, but that intuition might be a little bit out of sync with our best estimates from today's climate and carbon cycle models.' To calculate this timeframe, researchers combined information about the Earth's carbon cycle with information about the Earth's climate system taken from a group of climate models used in the latest IPCC report. The results showed that the average time between a single CO2 emission and maximum warming was 10.1 years, and reaffirmed that most of the warming persists for more than a century. The reason for this time lag is because the upper layers of the oceans take longer to heat up than the atmosphere, the scientists say. As the oceans take up more and more heat which causes the overall climate to warm up, the warming effects of CO2 emissions actually begin to diminish as CO2 is eventually removed from the atmosphere. Dr Matthew Watson, a climate scientists, said he was 'terrified' of the some geoengineering solutions . A climate scientist has said he is 'terrified' of the futuristic technologies he is helping to develop in a bid to slow global warming. British academics have spent £5.4 million ($8.5 million) in the last five years on taxpayer-funded 'geoengineering' projects to stop the effects of climate change. Dr Matthew Watson, lead investigator of a £1.8million ($2.8 million) project to pump chemicals into the atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays, said using such technologies will become inevitable if humanity fails to stop global warming. The Bristol University academic has already suffered a major setback, when much-trumpeted plans to send a huge balloon into the air to test his scheme was scrapped over a patenting dispute. Last week, he admitted that despite the millions already spent on research, scientists are still decades from seeing their dreams turn into reality. And he said they could indeed be dangerous. The schemes could see rainfall patterns change, droughts spread across the world and the ozone layer damaged beyond repair. 'Personally, this stuff terrifies me,' he said. 'Whilst it is clear that temperatures could be reduced during deployment, the potential for misstep is considerable. 'By identifying risks, we hope to contribute to the evidence base around geoengineering that will determine whether deployment, in the face of the threat of climate change, has the capacity to do more good than harm.' But he added that it would be 'unethical' not to try the technology. It takes around 10 years for these two competing factors to cancel each other out and for warming to be at a maximum. 'Our results show that people alive today are very likely to benefit from emissions avoided today and that these will not accrue solely to impact future generations,' Dr Ricke said. 'Our findings should dislodge previous misconceptions about this timeframe that have played a key part in the failure to reach policy consensus.' In the two decades since world leaders first got together to try to solve global warming, the world has become more polluted with heat-trapping gases, more crowded and just downright wilder. According to a separate study by the Associated Press, carbon dioxide emissions are up 60 per cent, global temperature are up six-tenths of a degree and sea levels have increased by three inches. 'Simply put, we are rapidly remaking the planet and beginning to suffer the consequences,' says Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. Diplomats from more than 190 nations opened talks Monday at a United Nations global warming conference in Lima, Peru, to pave the way for an international treaty they hope to forge next year. Overall, what really strikes me is the missed opportunity,' Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. 'We knew by the early 1990s that global warming was coming, yet we have done essentially nothing to head off the risk. I think that future generations may be justifiably angry about this.'

"UEFA President Michel Platini has expressed his fears that drones carrying bombs could could cause a disaster at football matches in the future. The Frenchman was appalled after players, fans and officials became involved in a mass brawl when a drone stoked political tensions between Serbia and Albania by flying a pro-Albanian flag on to the pitch during their Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday. English referee Martin Atkinson was eventually forced to abandon the game after Albania players feared for their safety as they were pelted by missiles as they fled from the fighting on the pitch.

Platini had already branded the incident 'inexcusable' but has added that future matches involving teams that share political tensions could present a serious problem to safety.

"Sex worker Charlotte Rose, who has slept with more than 1,000 men, is to stand as an MP in the Clacton by-election in Essex next month . A former 'Sex Worker of the Year' who claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men is to stand as an independent MP. Self-confessed 'high-class courtesan' Charlotte Rose, 34, will be going up against Ukip defector Douglas Carswell and 1980s television star Giles Watling in the Clacton by-election, in Essex. She previously appeared in a Channel 4 TV series about prostitution called Love for Sale, which starred Rupert Everett and Russell Brand. But now the sex worker, who started out in the industry at just 17 when she agreed to take part in a dominatrix-themed photo shoot, says she is ready for a life in politics. 'My main policy is about sexual freedom, taking control away from others,' said Ms Rose, who charges £180 an hour for her services. 'I also want there to be better sexual education in schools. 'Schools are not obliged to teach advanced sex and relationship education, which can deal with issues such as porn addiction and intimacy issues. 'Today's politicians have a lack of knowledge and understanding about what's really happening. 'Sex and relationships are second to survival when it comes to basic human needs. 'I'm dead against trafficking of women, but a large amount of women also choose to be sex workers - we do this work because we enjoy it. 'We want to help people learn and gain knowledge and skills.' After delving into the world of domination, Ms Rose fell pregnant and had the first of two children with her childhood sweetheart. But their seven-year relationship broke down when her partner had an affair with a neighbour. She then completed a hospitality degree at Plymouth University, where she worked in hotels, before deciding to combine two of her passions, people and sex, and become an escort. The mother-of-two joined a local escort agency but, after finding herself travelling far afield to get work, became independent. She moved to London from Exeter, Devon, after claiming she was hounded out by locals following media attention sparked by the Love for Sale TV show. Scroll down for video . The prostitute and sexual trainer appeared in Channel 4 series Love for Sale with Rupert Everett . She won a British Erotic Award for being Sex Worker of the Year 2013 and launched a sexual training franchise . Ms Rose won a British Erotic Award for being Sex Worker of the Year 2013 and has launched a sexual training franchise as part of a bid to improve people's sex lives. She said the government had failed to address issues with 'porn addiction' which had led to young men causing harm to women by trying to recreate what they have seen on the web. The aspiring politician also hit out at the authorities for failing to act over the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal. She said: 'It's appalling that people and government are too scared to take action. 'All politicians talk about family values, but how can they do that without talking about sex.' Former Conservative MP Douglas Carswell (right) defected to Ukip and will be standing against Ms Rose .

"As officials gave the final go-ahead to Thursday's Orion launch of the capsule that could take man to Mars, Nasa unveiled another important part of the mission - its countdown clock,. Last week, down came the countdown clock that dated back to the Apollo 12 moon shot in 1969 and signalled every space shuttle launch for 30 years. Today, the new clock, in the same exact spot at the Kennedy Space Center press site that, along with the nearby flag pole, had once earned national historic designation, was switched on for the first time. The new clock, in the same exact spot at the Kennedy Space Center press site that, along with the nearby flag pole, had once earned national historic designation, was switched on for the first time. The new clock is just as long at 26 feet, but a foot taller at 7 feet. The new clock is just as long at 26 feet, but a foot taller at 7 feet. Can show video as well as numbers . The new clock is just as long at 26 feet, but a foot taller at 7 feet. It's the nation's first new spacecraft intended for true outer-space travel by humans since the Apollo moon program. What better way to usher in this new era of exploration, NASA reasoned, than with the latest flat-screen gizmo. So last week, down came the countdown clock that dated back to the Apollo 12 moon shot in 1969 and signaled every space shuttle launch for 30 years. And up went the new display in the same exact spot at the Kennedy Space Center press site that, along with the nearby flag pole, had once earned national historic designation. The new clock is just as long at 26 feet, but a foot taller at 7 feet. NASA spokesman George Diller said the old clock, while still working, had become too expensive to fix and maintain. Parts were hard to come by. (It used 349 light bulbs to illuminate the hours, minutes and seconds, the colons and the plus and minus signs.) 'It was just becoming an antique,' Diller said. The new $280,000 display, similar to those used at sports stadiums, can provide multiple images in addition to the countdown time. 'An electronic billboard,' explained Mike Bolger, a NASA ground systems manager. The old clock used used 349 light bulbs to illuminate the hours, minutes and seconds, the colons and the plus and minus signs . Dismantled: Workmen haul the clock into a truck after the plug was pulled on the world's second most watched clock after Big Ben . The Orion capsule, on top of the rockets that will launch it on Thursday . On Tuesday, the countdown numbers ticked down in the lower right corner - far smaller than on the old familiar clock. But that's because the left half of the display showed a real-time, close-up image of the Delta IV rocket launch pad. In the upper right corner, the words 'Orion Test Flight' showed in red, sandwiched between an Orion emblem and the NASA logo. NASA took pains to keep the scene basically the same, with the clock and flag pole, according to Diller. Even so, more than a few space-age veterans were sorry to see the old, familiar clock hauled off. Diller tried to be philosophical about the switch: 'We won't have to worry about changing the light bulbs anymore.' Apollo 17's launch on Dec. 7, 1972, marked mankind's last trip to the moon - and the last crewed capsule to leave Earth's immediate vicinity. During its December 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles (5,790km) into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h) and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. The Launch Abort System and upper stage, shown in the left of this image, have been transported to Cape Canaveral. Here, they will be joined with the Delta IV Heavy Rocket ahead of a test flight in December. The right image shows the stages Orion will go through during flight . During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. The flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later Orion flights. The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. This inaugural Orion - scheduled for a 7:05 a.m. EST send-off - will carry no crew during the 4 1/2-hour test flight and be confined to Earth orbit. But it will aim for a high point of 3,600 miles on the second loop of the planet, setting the spacecraft up for a 20,000-mph, 4,000-degree re-entry. Splashdown will occur in the Pacific, 600 miles southwest of San Diego. Managers from United Launch Alliance (ULA) and Lockheed Martin gave a 'go' to proceed toward launch pending completion of open work during the Launch Readiness Review for Orion's flight test. The weather is forecast to be 60 percent 'go' for a scheduled liftoff at 7:05 a.m. EST on Thursday, Dec. 4. With Countdown Clock in the foreground, Space Shuttle Discovery lifts off at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,  Nasa spokesman George Diller said the old clock, while still working, had become too expensive to fix and maintain. For this launch, a Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting. Future Orions will be launched aboard NASA's still-in-development Space Launch System, or SLS, intended to carry astronauts to asteroids, Mars and beyond. One plan calls for an asteroid to be corralled in orbit around the moon, so an Orion crew can explore the rock sometime in the 2020s. Mars expeditions would follow in the 2030s. NASA is counting on the new countdown clock to be around for all that. Traditionalists, meanwhile, can take heart. The space center hopes to reassemble and display the old clock at its tourist stop next year.","Clock that dated back to Apollo 12 moon shot in 1969 and signaled every space shuttle launch removed last week .

"The Royal and Ancient  has voted to allow women members for the first time in its 260-year history. The club in St Andrews, Fife, known as the 'home of golf', voted by a simple majority in favour of allowing women members. Around 85 per cent of the club's 2,500 global members said they thought women should be able to join. The Royal & Ancient  has voted in favour of allowing women to become members, after 260 years of only men . Peter Dawson, secretary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A), said: 'I am very pleased indeed to announce that the membership of the R&A of St Andrews has voted overwhelmingly in favour of welcoming women members. 'More than three quarters of the club's global membership took part in the ballot, with a decisive 85 per cent voting for women to become members. 'This vote has immediate effect and I can confirm that the R&A of St Andrews is now a mixed membership club.' It had been widely expected that members would back their committees'  call to move with the times, but it was by no means a foregone conclusion. Last year, members of Royal Burgess golf club in Edinburgh were presented with a similar opportunity, but voted 69-64 against admitting women. The R&A had resisted moves to admit women to its membership, but matters escalated when major Open Championship sponsor HSBC said it was uncomfortable with the major being held at an exclusively male club. While the R&A's members have access to the clubhouse behind the first tee at the Old Course, they belong to a club, not a golf course. The seven golf courses at St Andrews are open to the public. Around 85 per cent of the club's 2,500 global membership voted in favour of the change . Earlier this year, Professor Louise Richardson, the first woman principal of St Andrews University, spoke out against the ban on women. She has until now been denied honorary membership of the club, an honour given to her predecessors in the post. Professor Richardson claimed the snub meant she was unable to entertain university donors at the clubhouse, traditionally an important part of the principal's role. 1734: The organisation is founded as The Society of St Andrews Golfers, a local golf club. 1834: King William IV becomes patron of the club, now known as the Royal and Ancient. 1893: Overcrowding leads to the club buying land off the town council for £5,000 to make another course. It is aptly named the New Course. 1897: The Jubilee Course, which has 12 holes, is built. Six holes are added in 1906. 1913: An Act of Parliament allows the club to charge green fees to people using the Old Course, allowing it to raise enough money to open a fourth course - the Eden. 2004: The club hands over its role as one of the governing authorities of the game to The R&A - a namesake group of companies. 2012: Gordon Brown calls on the club to abandon its policy on all-male membership. 2014: The club votes to allow female members, with 85 per cent of its 2,500-strong membership voting in favour of the change. Annika Sorenstam, the winner of 10 majors, is also expected to be among the first women to join the club. Mr Dawson added that there could now be certain women 'fast-tracked' into membership. He said: 'The membership has also acted to fast-track a significant initial number of women to become members in the coming months. 'This is a very important and positive day in the history of the R&A. 'The R&A has served the sport of golf well for 260 years and I am confident that the club will continue to do so in future with the support of all its members, both women and men.' Cabinet Secretary for Sport and Equalities Shona Robison said the decision was a 'step on the road' to full equality for women . Cabinet Secretary for Sport and Equalities Shona Robison has heralded the club's decision. Miss Robison said: 'In the week before Scotland welcomes golf fans from across the world for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, this decision by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews to admit women members is another step on the road to full equality in sport and society. 'This decision by the world's most exclusive and prestigious golf club sees real progress towards making golf a more equal sport which is very important. 'We firmly believe that there should be no barriers at all to being involved in sport with everyone able to participate in and enjoy sport - whoever they are and whatever their background. 'I hope this welcome development leads to the few remaining single-gender golf clubs to take a similar path.' Three all-male clubs are on the British Open rotation - Royal St George's, Royal Troon and Muirfield - but they may soon also change their membership policies. The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers is set to begin its review process on the issue of men-only membership at Muirfield, East Lothian, in late September. There are also increasing signs of movement on the matter at Royal St George's in Sandwich, Kent, which hosted the 2011 Open. South Ayrshire's Royal Troon - which is scheduled to stage the 2016 Open - appears to have no plans to move from single-sex membership. However, it points out that the town's ladies club use the course - despite having their own clubhouse, captain and committee.","Women will be allowed to join the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, St Andrews .

"Bill Cosby was sued Tuesday by a Southern California woman who claims the comedian molested her in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion around 1974 when she was 15 years old. Judy Huth's sexual battery lawsuit does not specify how much she is seeking from Cosby, who has in recent weeks faced renewed accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted more than a dozen women for many years. Huth's lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, however, is the first time that a woman has claimed she was underage when she was abused, and it is the first lawsuit Cosby has faced claiming sexual abuse since 2005. Scroll down for video . New victim: A woman is suing Bill Cosby saying the he sexually assaulted her when she was just a teenager at the Playboy Mansion . Huth's lawsuit states that she and a 16-year-old friend first met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot and the comedian gave the girls drinks a week later at a tennis club. The lawsuit says the three played billiards, with the girls having to drink a beer every time Cosby won a game. The lawsuit then states that Cosby took them to the Playboy Mansion after several drinks, and told the teenagers to lie and say they were 19 years old if asked. Her lawsuit states Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him with his hand after she returned from the bathroom, with the actor waiting for her on a bed. Sued: Andrea Constand (above) claimed Cosby drugged and molested her in 2004, and her case was settled out of court by the actor . She also says he tried to put his hand down her pants. An email message sent to Cosby's attorney Martin Singer was not immediately returned. Singer has denied previous accusations or said the women raising the claims in interviews had been discredited. Singer's statement does not apply to a lawsuit brought in 2005 by Andrea Constand, who claimed Cosby drugged and molested her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion in 2004. Constand, who worked for the women's basketball team at Temple University, and Cosby settled the case before trial. Cosby resigned from the university's board of trustees on Monday. He had been the school's public face, appearing in advertisements, fundraising campaigns and delivering commencement speeches. Cosby, 77, has never been criminally charged stemming from any of the sex-abuse allegations, many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s. Huth claims she suffered severe emotional distress and that she discovered its impact on her within the past three years, which allows her to file the lawsuit under California law. 'This traumatic incident, at such a tender age, has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for (Huth) that has caused significant problems throughout her life,' the lawsuit states. Interestingly enough, while Mark Whitaker’s biography of Bill Cosby made no mention of any of these allegations, it did talk about how Cosby was a frequent guest at the Playboy Mansion. Underage: The lawsuit claims that Cosby (above with Playboy Mansion founder Hugh Hefner) told the girls to lie and say they were 19 if asked . Cosby's laywer, Martin Singer,  released a statement last month calling recent rape allegations 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical.' 'This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards,' says Singer. 'Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?' He then closed by saying, 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' More than ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions. Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.' These continued allegations are having a major impact on Cosby's work, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star. TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network.","Judy Huth says she was sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby in 1974 when she was just 15 years old at the Playboy Mansion .
She has now filed a lawsuit against the actor, saying that she met him on a film set and that he gave her alcohol before taking her to the mansion .
She then says she was told to lie and say she was 19, and that Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him with his hand .

"A maths teacher waded into a shallow river and captured a 17ft anaconda hours after it snatched his friend's dog from the bank. Sebastien Bascoules, who lives in Matoury, French Guiana, hauled the 175lb snake onto land in nearby Montsinery, after a friend phoned him with news of his beloved pet, Minus. Capturing a snake that size, the 39-year-old said, was  'a dream come true'. Scroll down for video .

Mr Bascoules holds the head of the 175lb snake as his friend grips its tail - the maths teacher asked his friend to hold the reptile's tail so it wouldn't 'strangulate me' The snake was kept in the Bascoules family's bath over night as Mr Bascoules said it was too late to re-home the reptile away from the residential area once they had captured it . Recalling the incident, Mr Bascoules said: 'At first I . was not scared because I thought it was smaller - but I was very . surprised by his strength and his length - more than five metres. He added: 'Since I was 10 years old I have liked handling reptiles but this was the biggest snake I had ever seen and I had ever caught.' Mr Bascoules asked his friend to help capture the anaconda, by grabbing its tail, 'otherwise it could strangulate me'. But because it was still digesting the dog, Mr Bascoules said, it was  'very calm before I touched it'. Mr Bascoules, right, holds the anaconda's head as he and his friend drag it from a river in French Guiana . Onlookers gasp in amazement as Mr Bascoules' prized catch, which has now been blindfolded and restrained with a t-shirt, is captured on film .

After blindfolding the wriggling reptile with a t-shirt Mr Bascoules put it in his bathtub to store over night - but not before his three children, Noam, 11, Solal, eight, and Mano, five, could pose for pictures with it. Mr Bascoules said by the time he had captured the snake, it was too late to re-home it away from the residential area, so he decided it could spend the night at his family home. Not everyone was a fan of the house guest, he said: 'My wife was worried it might escape from the bathroom during the night. He added: 'We didn't have to be worried because I put it a cloth on his head so it was blind and became like a big worm.' Mr Bascoules said once the snake was blindfolded with a t-shirt it was turned into a 'giant worm' Mr Bascoules, who has caught 15-20 anacondas, described capturing one this big as 'a dream come true' The next day Mr Bascoules released the anaconda six miles away into a river close to swamps where the creatures are often found. The incredible event unfolded last year but video of the remarkable capture and release exercise has only just emerged. Mr Bascoules, originally from France, has lived in French Guiana for 15 years, and works part-time as a tour guide. He said he chose the area because of its fauna - particularly reptiles and amphibians. Mr Bascoules said snakes were 'really common' in French Guiana, where there is 98 species. Not surprisingly, this isn't the first time Mr Bascoules has captured an anaconda. He estimates he's caught 15-20.","Sebastien Bascoules captured the anaconda because it ate a friend's dog .

"Maxine Carr, now 37, served 21 months in jail for providing child killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi . Maxine Carr met her ‘besotted’ new husband on Facebook and spent months exchanging messages with him online before revealing her shameful past, it has emerged. The 37-year-old, who served 21 months in jail for providing killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, in 2002, is said to have initiated the romance after finding him online. Carr, who now lives under a new identity thanks to a lifelong anonymity order, spent months exchanging messages with the man who she ended up marrying in a £5,000 private ceremony last week. According to sources, former teaching assistant Carr ‘entranced’ her lover, who is now said to be ‘utterly devoted’ to her despite knowing about her shameful past. A source told The Sun: ‘He’s lovely and doesn’t like drama. He’s totally under the control of Maxine. ‘It took time for him to get to grips with who she was, but by then he was utterly devoted.’ He apparently had no idea of her real identity until she revealed it to him several months after finding him online, much to the surprise and shock of his family. However, despite her past, the pair recently splashed out on a wedding at a three-star country hotel where guests enjoyed a three-course banquet and sparkling wine. After exchanging vows in front of a registrar, the newlyweds posed for photographs on the hotel’s patio before toasting their nuptials with friends and family. The former girlfriend of Soham murderer Huntley wore a £2,000 ivory dress for her big day and was given away by her 71-year-old mother. Following the ceremony, the newlyweds departed for a honeymoon at a family-friendly resort, although it is not known whether they travelled abroad or remained in the UK for the romantic break.

During this interview Carr told police Holly Wells was the type of girl she would like as a daughter . The order, which was handed to her upon her release from prison in 2004, restricts publication of details of her new partner or wedding because it could lead to her identification. Carr was the girlfriend of school caretaker Huntley when he was arrested soon after the bodies of schoolgirls Holly and Jessica were found in August 2002. They had been missing from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, for 13 days. Huntley eventually admitted that the girls had died in his house after he had invited them in, but said their deaths were accidental. He had told them that Carr was in the house, but she had actually gone to Grimsby to visit relatives. Although Carr was not implicated in the murder, she gave Huntley a false alibi, claiming that she had been with him at the time of the killings, which delayed the police investigation. In fact she was at a nightclub in Grimsby with another man. Maxine Carr (left) served 21 months in jail for providing child killer Ian Huntley (right) with a false alibi after he murdered schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in August 2002 . She was originally jailed for three-and-a-half years for perverting the course of justice by covering for Huntley but only served half of her sentence. Police protection and a new identity for Carr are thought to have cost the taxpayer millions. She is just one of four former UK prisoners to be given secret identities, along with child killer Mary Bell and James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a seven-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison.","Carr is said to have initiated the romance after finding new partner online .

"A Saudi cleric has publicly claimed that the Earth is a static object which is orbited by the sun, adding that centuries of evidence to the contrary is little more than fabrication. Sheikh Bandar al-Khaibari is believed to have been speaking at a university lecture in the United Arab Emirates when a student asked him whether the Earth rotates or is stationary. The Islamic scholar quickly replies 'stationary and does not move', before launching into a long-winded and confusing explanation that appears to the suggest that if the Earth was moving, airliners would never be able to reach their destination. Scroll down for video . Bizarre: Saudi cleric Sheikh Bandar al-Khaibari has publicly claimed that the Earth is a static object . After telling the student that the Earth does not rotate, Sheikh al-Khaibari attempts to back up his argument with religious statements and quotes from other Islamic clerics. Perhaps struggling to make his argument understood, the religious lecturer then attempts to use a visual aid to illustrate how difficult it would be for airliners to travel if the Earth is spinning. Beginning his bizarre summary, Sheikh al-Khaibari 'First of all, where are we now? We go to Sharjah airport [in the United Arab Emirates] to travel to China by plane, clear?' Holding a cup of water aloft, the cleric adds: 'Focus with me, this is Earth'. Over the next 30 seconds, Sheikh al-Khaibari enters into a baffling explanation of his point of view, claiming that if the Earth truly was rotating, then airliners could just stop in the air and wait for the country to arrive beneath them, rather than waste time actually flying. 'China would be coming towards it,' he argues. On the other hand, he said, if the Earth was moving in the opposite direction the plane would never be able to reach its destination because 'China is also rotating'. Struggle: In an effort to make his argument understood, the religious lecturer attempts to explain that it would be difficult for airliners to travel around the world if the Earth was always spinning away from them . On concluding his baffling explanation, Sheikh al-Khaibari went on to claim the NASA lunar mission was Hollywood fabrication and that humans have never been to the moon, according to Al Arabiya. Video of the incident has inevitably proved a hit on social media, where users started an Arab-language hashtag that translates as #cleric_rejects_rotation_of_Earth. One user pointed out that the footage first appeared February 15 - the 451th anniversary of Galileo Galilei's birth. Galileo was famously twice accused of heresy by the Catholic Church after publicly supporting the Copernican theory that the Earth and other planets rotate around the sun. While many are using the hashtag to mock Sheikh al-Khaibari's views, others said it should be turned into a way to educate young people about the universe .","Sheikh Bandar al-Khaibari claimed Earth is stationary and the sun rotates .

"Grappling in the box is just like diving — it drives everybody mad. The important thing now is that if referees are going to clamp down on it, it has to be the same for everybody. It has been funny to see Chelsea almost position themselves as victims. Yes, John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were put in a couple of headlocks at Old Trafford. But are those two innocent of grabbing people in the area? Do me a favour. Every team in the league does it because they know they can get away with it. It’s the same with any part of the game — diving to win a free-kick, illegally stopping an opponent — if you don’t get punished, you’ll keep doing it.

But I’ve always said if a player dives one week and is banned for three games, there’s no way he’ll do it next time. It’s the same with grappling. If penalties are given and cards are shown, it will start to disappear. I have sympathy for the referees because there is so much pushing and shoving going on — they can’t keep their eyes on everyone. It works both ways, too, with strikers fouling defenders just as much as the other way around. In my playing days I covered the space at the near post for a corner, but if I felt I could stop an opponent with a grapple I would, because I knew the referee wouldn’t punish me. My Sportsmail colleague Martin Keown, who helped launch this campaign, was a great defender but I seem to remember even he grabbed me around the neck a few times! If I was a manager that’s how I would want my players to defend. Not because it’s right, but because teams have got away with it for years. It’s time something was done. There’s no doubt Ryan Shawcross is a serial offender. But he’s not alone. Shawcross is one of a group who stand watching the man rather than the ball — it’s not proper defending and it has to stop.

"The family of deceased sprint car racer Kevin Ward, Jr., declared the case of their son's death 'is not at rest' and claimed that Tony Stewart 'intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin.' A grand jury decided not to indict the three-time NASCAR champion Wednesday, who struck and killed Ward in a horrifying crash that was caught on film. At an afternoon press conference announcing the decision, Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo said there was 'no aberrational driving' on the part of Stewart. Tantillo also made the startling revelation that Ward was under the influence of marijuana the night he was hit and that there was enough of the drug in his system 'to impair judgement'. Scroll down for videos . No charges: A grand jury has decided not to charge Tony Stewart (pictured) in the death of fellow driver Kevin Ward, Jr, who was hit and killed in a sprint race last month . Victim: Kevin Ward Jr, 20, died August 9 after being struck by Stewart's car at a dirt-track race in upstate New York. It was revealed Wednesday that Ward was under the influence of marijuana at the time of his death - enough to 'impair judgement' The family released a statement claiming that Stewart was accelerating through a caution as all other drivers slowed. The statement says Stewart 'intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin by accelerating and sliding his car towards him' and that the talk about Ward only confuses the issue. 'The focus should be on Mr. Stewart and not my son. This matter is not at rest and we will pursue all remedies in fairness to Kevin.' Ward was fatally struck by Stewart while getting out of his car to confront the racing veteran, after the two collided on a prior lap at a race on August 9 at upstate New York's Canandaigua Motorsports Park track. No toxicology tests were conducted on Stewart, following New York law, but he was interviewed that night by a certified drug recognition expert, Tantillo said. Tantillo says he informed Ward's father of the decision, and that while Ward Sr was 'disappointed', he appreciated the work done on the investigation. Should Tony Stewart have faced criminal charges? Should Tony Stewart have faced criminal charges? Now share your opinion . The grand jury deliberated for less than an hour on whether to bring up charges of second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide before determining 'that there is no basis to charge Tony Stewart with any crimes'. Tantillo said the grand jury saw accident reconstructions, reviewed photographs and two video recordings of the incident, heard from witnesses and was presented other evidence before voting on Wednesday not to indict Stewart. Moments before: Kevin Ward Jr appears right in front of Stewart's car, in a YouTube grab from the deadly collision . Authorities maintained early in the investigation there was no evidence of criminal behavior by Stewart, but refrained from clearing him while they tried to determine if he hit the throttle as he approached Ward. Stewart and Ward bumped cars during the race and the collision sent Ward into an outside retaining wall while Stewart remained in the race. Ward jumped from his car in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart during the ensuing caution period. When Stewart's car came around on the next lap, Ward, while in the middle of the track, pointed at Stewart. As Stewart approached Ward, his car appeared to swerve, striking Ward and throwing him 50 feet. Stewart, who had often driven in non-NASCAR races because of his love for competition, went into seclusion for the next three weeks. He returned to NASCAR on August 31. NASCAR introduced rules following the fatal incident that forbid drivers from getting out of their cars during caution periods until permitted to by a track safety official.

"Up to 5,000 black cab drivers blockaded London's city centre yesterday in protest against a boom in unlicensed minicabs and rickshaws as well as the hugely popular Uber smartphone app. For the second time in three months, London's famous black cabs choked Trafalgar Square and Whitehall - honking their horns as they crawled along the capital's streets. The drivers want taxi licensing laws to be enforced and claim the taxi service app, Uber, is taking a large percentage of the market while unburdened by the regulatory costs black cabs are subject to. Scroll down for video . Big Ben rises in the background over the Houses of Parliament as black cab drivers blockade Parliament Square in protest against the boom in unlicensed minicabs and rickshaw drivers on the streets of London . The drivers were holding a mass slow-driving demonstration on Whitehall in anger at what they perceive is a lax attitude from the authorities towards unlicensed taxis on the streets of the UK capital . There are around 25,000 licensed black taxis in London, the only ones which can be legally hailed in the street. But unlicensed cabs, operated for cash by private individuals, are widely available in busy spots at night . A protest was also held in June in cities around the world, including London, against the US company, which uses freelance drivers with GPS-enabled smartphones to link up with passengers. The company has expanded globally into more than 100 cities in 36 countries and is considered such a growing force that some of Silicon Valley's biggest investors have ploughed money into it. The company is currently valued at around £11 billion. Yesterday, the general secretary of The London Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA), who organised the protest slammed Uber. He called it a 'massive American monster that uses its financial muscle and army of lawyers to threaten, cajole and kowtow licensing authorities and regulators', City AM reports. Yesterday, drivers were also seen venting their anger at London's mayor, Boris Johnson, they unveiled a giant blow-up rat representing the his approach to the issue. 'Apparently, we're iconic to London, which we are. We should be looked after,' said John O'Sullivan, 40, in his taxi on The Mall, the processional route from Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar Square. There are around 25,000 licensed black taxis in London, which can be hailed in the street, and 60,000 licensed private hire vehicles, which can be pre-booked but not flagged down. But unlicensed cabs, operated by private individuals out to make a few extra pounds, are widely available in busy spots at night. They are far cheaper than black cabs, whose cost rises into double figures for even short trips. 'We've been asking them for a long time for greater enforcement against illegal minicabs, touting,' said Mr McNamara. 'Every night of the week in London, there are people being attacked, robbed, assaulted by unlicensed, uninsured minicab drivers,' he told AFP. 'The problem in recent years has bloomed. It's now completely out of control at night in the West End,' the city's entertainment district. 'Apparently, we're iconic to London': Taxi drivers say they have been asking for greater enforcement of rules . Knowledgeable: Licensed London black cab drivers, dubbed the 'eyes and ears' of the city, spend three years on a moped learning 'The Knowledge' - every street in London and routes across it. A driver stops to take a picture as his fellow cabbies creep along Whitehall yesterday afternoon . A passenger and her dog peer out at the chaos surrounding them . Besides unregulated drivers, cabbies also hit out at the pedal rickshaws 'clogging up' central London and 'ripping off' tourists. Licensed London black cab drivers, dubbed the 'eyes and ears' of the city, spend three years on a moped learning 'The Knowledge' - every street in London and routes across it. 'You can't ride a moped around London for three years without falling in love with the place,' said Mr McNamara. 'When you know every inch of it as we do, this is the greatest city on Earth and it's being managed by people who wouldn't be allowed to run some third-world backwater,' he said. The giant rat was placed next to the statue of king Charles I - to which all road distances to London are measured. Bemused tourists posed for photographs as cabbies slowly drove past. Bob Limerick, 58, a cab driver of 15 years, said: 'We just want the law enforced. Simple as that.' O'Sullivan said: 'We go through years and years of doing The Knowledge, which is not easy, and then it seems like we're being shafted by TfL (Transport for London).' Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director for surface transport, said the protest was regrettable. 'The taxi trade has several forums with TfL and the mayor. We urge them to communicate directly with us on the specific issues they wish to discuss,' he said.","Black cabs choked up the streets in go-slow protest at lack of enforcement .

"Charles Barkley on Tuesday doubled down on his recent controversial comments about events in Ferguson, Missouri, as he maintained the black community needs to shoulder more blame for tragedies like the one that befell 18-year-old Michael Brown. 'We as black people, we got a lot of crooks,' the NBA legend told CNN in an interview he gave after taking heat for similar comments he made on a Philadelphia sports radio show last week. The 51-year-old, who also famously supported the acquittal of George Zimmerman, publicly agreed with the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson and doesn't fault police who tend to single out black people while investigating crimes. 'There's a reason they racially profile us at times,' he told CNN. 'Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes its right.' 'There's a reason they racially profile us': In an interview with CNN, Barkley defended his recent support of Ferguson police and said black people can tend toward lawlessness and are, therefor, at fault for racial profiling . 'We have to look at ourselves in the mirror,' he said of people in black communities. 'To act like we hold no responsibility for some of this stuff is disingenuous' He maintains a sort of 'bad seed' take on both police and the black community. There are good cops and bad cops, he said, black criminals and those who abide by the law. And since, as Barkley said, the black community 'got a lot of crooks,' he thinks casting blame at police helps no one. 'We have to look at ourselves in the mirror,' he said of people in black communities. 'To act like we hold no responsibility for some of this stuff is disingenuous.' Interviewer Brooke Baldwin then turned the subject to another case involving police and their handling of situations involving black men--that of Eric Garner, a New York man who died after several police held him down and put him in a choke hold. Backlash: Civil rights activist Van Jones, himself a CNN contributor, called Barkley's comments inflammatory and irresponsible . 'I don't think they were trying to kill Mr. Garner,' Barkley told Baldwin. 'He was a big man and they tried to get him down.' Barkley said the media tend to only bring up race when situations like these emerge, and then it's the same group of national civil rights figures--and not members of the specific community--who voice outrage. '[The] same sad sack of black characters,' he called them. 'We need someone in St. Louis to stand up and say ""hey let's handle this situation.""' CNN's own Van Jones, himself a black civil rights activist, spoke to Don Lemon to hit back at Barkley for the comments he said were 'inflammatory' and 'irresponsible.' 'Barkley really went far beyond just saying he agreed or disagreed with that grand jury. He said a lot of things that were really inflammatory,' Jones said. 'The worst of it was his contention that African Americans who were concerned about this case were somehow anti-cop. 'That is really dangerous. African Americans want better policing, not no policing,' Jones continued, before he said that African Americans shouldn't have to choose between the two. The outrage began on Monday, when Barkley's comments to Mike Missanelli of Philadelphia's 97.5 The Fanatic last made Tuesday started to be heard. 'There is no excuse for people to be out there burning down people's businesses, burning down police cars,' he told Missanelli as he referred to the rioters as 'scumbags.' Barkley went on to commend police who work in black areas. 'If it wasn’t for the cops we would be living in the Wild, Wild West in our neighborhoods,' he said. 'We can’t pick out certain incidentals that don’t go our way and act like the cops are all bad. Start of the controversy: Barkley told a Philadelphia radio show host last week that he supports the Ferguson police and the grand jury's decision not to indict unarmed black teen Michael Brown's killer Darren Wilson . 'Scumbags': Barkley made his stance known to Mike Missanelli (pictured) of Philadelphia's 97.5 The Fanatic on Tuesday, when he described the looters in Ferguson as 'scumbags' 'Do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it wasn't for the cops?' he said. Barkley, who's become a high-profile sports commentator since leaving the NBA behind in 2000, said the media is at fault for at least some of what's gone on in the wake of Michael Brown's August 4 death. 'The true story came out from the grand jury testimony,' he said. 'I can’t believe anything I hear on television anymore. 'And, that’s why I don’t like talking about race issues with the media anymore, because they  love this stuff, and lead people to jump to conclusions. 'The media shouldn’t do that. They never do that when black people kill each other.' Barkley also publicly sided with a decision to exonerate George Zimmerman in 2013 after he was tried in the shooting death of another unarmed black teen, Trayvon Martin, notes the Christian Science Monitor. Looters robbed Ferguson businesses and set fire to property in the wake of the grand jury decision not to convict Darren Wilson, which many have criticized as a step in the wrong direction for the town where tensions between citizens and police have long been an issue .","The opinionated NBA great from Alabama defended his comments calling Ferguson rioters 'scumbags' that made waves Monday .

"Arizona Cardinals defensive end Darnell Dockett is out for the season with a knee injury, so perhaps it's unsurprising that he's spending a lot more of his time stirring up drama on Twitter. On Monday, the 33-year-old posted an unintentionally provocative picture of Malia Obama which he somehow eclipsed today by live-tweeting his experience serving jury duty. The picture of the 16-year-old first daughter has been making the rounds online, and is a screen grab of a televised event that focuses on her back side. Scroll down for full jury duty live tweet and audio . Arizona Cardinals defensive end Darnell Dockett has been causing controversy on social media with a two controversial posts this week . On Monday, Dockett reposted this picture of 16-year-old first daughter Malia Obama on Instagram. The photo has been making the rounds online the past day or so, but Dockett chose to repost a picture uploaded by an Instagram user who captioned the photo 'When her prom?' An Instagram used with the username 'dreday_4' reposted the image to his feed on Monday with the caption 'When her prom?'. Dockett apparently found the picture funny since he commented 'Omgggg' and reposted it on his own profile, adding 'lmfaooo' to the caption. It appears both have since deleted the picture of Malia, a minor, from their profiles. But if Dockett felt any shame in posting the controversial picture of the eldest first daughter, he didn't show it on Tuesday when he started tweeting bright and early from inside court where he was serving on a jury. And like most people called in to perform their civic duty, Dockett wasn't too happy to be there, and continued to tweet even after a  bailiff asked all of the jurors to hand over their phones. 'Damn I got jury duty today!!! F***! I'm not the one for this,' he wrote. Dockett went on to express his distrust for the American justice department, writing the the system is flawed and because 'people who doing jury duty with me has already made there mind up on this guy...so do I really matter?' He then dispenses from legal advice, while also revealing a detail of the case. According to his tweets, the person on trial may have talked to investigators without a lawyer. On Tuesday, Dockett went on to live-tweet from court where he was serving jury duty. Pictured above in a silly shot posted to his Instagram account recently . 'I wish this guy would have told me what his intentions was, I could have helped him plan this out better to get away with it! #badplan' 'Rule #1 don't talk with out a lawyer!!!! #2 all cases can be beat!!! #3 call Dockett to help plan!! #4 keep don't talk with out a Lawyer!!' At one point during his day on jury, Dockett goes on a tangent about the police officer watching over his group and about how he's not intimidated by the man. 'They bring this big a** police in here like he supposed to scare me while I'm looking like I don't give a s***. I'm like you wand [coffee] and [donuts].' Dockett gives even more annoyed when the police officer tells him he can't elave to get food. 'I just told this guy I'm hungry and he's like I can't leave.. wtf U mean I can't eat! Ok watch this. Im gonna order pizza off this app! F.U.!' He also boasts about double-parking his $450,000 car in a handicap spot, which he gained access to with a sticker from a recent surgery, and the registered pistol inside. While he tweets several times about possibly getting kicked out of court, he continued to tweet into Tuesday evening. He even appears to have come around to see the legal process as at least entertaining. 'I need to be a lawyer...this is crazy!!!' one of his more recent tweets reads. This isn't the first time Dockett has made controversial remarks on Twitter. Last year, he refused to apology for a racially-insensitive tweet about Asians, in which he wrote: 'Apple has a new device out for Chinese people. The iOpener'.

"Quite the spread: Rosney, 54, takes 38 separate pills and supplements to treat his body and brain. He has an IQ of 192 . A man with a claim to being the second-most intelligent person on the planet has revealed that he takes a mixture of 38 drugs and pills every day in a bid to stay in top mental and physical form. Rick Rosner, 54, boasts an IQ of 192, which has seemingly only been topped by a Greek doctor, Evangelos Katsioulis, according to the world genius directory. But despite his apparent intellectual capacity, Rosner lists himself as unemployed while he works on writing a book entitled Dumbass Genius. The former TV writer and bouncer instead spends his time developing theories, working on a book, and visiting some five gyms per day, aided by cocktail of medical supplements. Rosner, who revealed the routine to Business Insider, listed a staggering array of substances, ranging from coffee and aspirin to an experimental pill designed to remove protein from the brain. Speaking to MailOnline about his routine, Rosner said he takes the pills because: 'I'd like to remain healthy and live for as long as possible. 'A lot of these things may not do anything for you - if I had to guess maybe only a third of this stuff has benefits. 'I try to read up about what these things are supposed to do - as new studies come out sometimes I swap things in and out.' 'I probably alter what I take on a three-to-four-monthly rotation.' Along with the supplements, Rosner has also estimated that he spends around two and a half hours per day in the gym, sometimes visiting five locations in a day. 'Working on my book': Rosner, who tweeted this picture of himself recently, now spends his time writing his book Dumbass Genius . When asked why he sticks to the intense routine, he replied: 'I like it', and said that it is part of the 'obsessive' personality which led him to testing his mind rigorously enough to come out with the 192 IQ score. Rosner, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife of more than 20 years, spent years as a bouncer in bars, and even as a nude model, before starting to work in television. He said his IQ score was originally came from 'desperation to have something going for me' while working menial jobs and trying to get a girlfriend. Pills, pills pills: Rosner listed 38 separate supplements, though admits a two-thirds of them probably don't do anything . But even now, after a series of jobs in television and even an Emmy nomination, Rosner defends the tests as 'the best of a bad bunch' when it comes to quantifying intellect. In a nod to the fact that IQ doesn't tell the whole story, between gym sessions and pill-popping Rosner writes a book of memoirs he will entitle Dumbass Genius. He said: 'People think of smart people as doing really smart stuff... but I've done a lot of stupid things.' Omega 3 fish oil capsules . Aspirin .

"The FBI has announced it believes it has identified 'Jihadi John', the executioner seen in the ISIS hostage videos . The FBI has identified the ISIS executioner who appears in the beheading videos of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker David Haines. Agency director James Comey told reporters today that he knew who the militant was but would not be releasing his identity or nationality to the media. The executioner, who has a British accent and has been dubbed Jihadi John, is one of four British jihadis known as the 'Beatles' holding hostages in Syria. He appears in the group’s execution videos wielding a knife – and taunts President Obama before carrying out the killings . Today British officials would not say if the identity had been shared with the authorities on London, and would not be drawn on whether any arrests are imminent. A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We won't be commenting on matters of security at this stage.' Comey said the FBI believes that ISIS is 'looking to try to do something in the U.S.,' but added he did not believe the group is capable of a sophisticated or complex attack. During questioning from reporters at the FBI headquarters Comey also spoke about Khorasan group, an al Qaeda affiliate who were targeted along with ISIS by American airstrikes in Syria earlier this week. He said he was 'not confident at all' the threat from Khorasan militant group was thwarted by the airstrikes. 'We don't have complete visibility about their activities. 'We believe they've been working toward an attack, but it's hard to say whether it would come tomorrow, in three weeks, or in three months,' he said. FBI Director James Comey (pictured) told reporters today that he knew who the militant was but would not be releasing his identity or nationality to the media. The executioner, who has a British accent,  is one of four British jihadis known as the 'Beatles' holding hostages in Syria . Comey added the FBI is still working hard to identify two people in ISIS videos who appear to have American or Canadian accents. 'We have a big focus going on that right now,' Comey said. He said about a dozen Americans are believed to be fighting with extremist groups in Syria at the moment. He says more than 100 Americans have either tried to go to Syria and been arrested, gone successfully, or gone and come back. The figure of 100 has often been misinterpreted to represent the number of U.S. citizens fighting in Syria. Comey says all the Americans who have returned after fighting with extremist groups are either under investigation, under surveillance or have been arrested. The director says he's not confident the U.S. has identified every American who had joined up with militants in Syria. The masked man was seen in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley, 40, (right) and Steven Sotloff, 31 (left). Comey did not address whether U.S. believes man actually carried out the killings . British aid worker, David Haines, 44, was seen in a  gruesome video with Jihadi John before his death. Today British officials would not say if the identity had been shared with the authorities on London, and would not be drawn on whether any arrests are imminent . Yesterday British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond revealed intelligence agencies were closing the net on Jihadi John. Hammond, who just ten days ago admitted special forces didn't know where the Islamic terror group was holding its British hostages, said the investigation into tracking down the killer with the British accent was 'narrowing down the field'. Speaking to American television network CNN at the United Nations summit in New York, Mr Hammond said: 'We are getting warm, we are working on all the leads. 'There's a big investigation and we are getting warm. We're narrowing down the field, but I don't want to say any more at this stage.' Earlier this week it was revealed that US spy planes are flying above Britain monitoring telephone and computer signals in a bid to track down Jihadi John and those who are communicating with him. The aircraft, manned by British pilots and carrying FBI agents, are equipped with technology so advanced they can detect heat coming off a keyboard when a button is pressed. A source revealed Jihadi John, comes from a South London suburb about 10 miles from Central London. The signals and data collected by the spy planes is being sent back to the US to be analysed, the Sunday Express reported. An FBI source told the paper: 'Electronic footprints might help us pinpoint the location of the British IS executioner because we believe there are associates of his in the UK who are directly communicating with him.' A formation of US Navy F-18E Super Hornets refueling having carried out airstrikes on targets linked to ISIS. Comey said he was 'not confident at all' the threat from Khorasan militant group was thwarted by the airstrikes . Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. The U.S. has also been increasing its surveillance flights over Syria, getting better intelligent on potential targets and militant movements . International revulsion after the scenes were posted on the internet sparked a massive manhunt by British and American security services and the investigation has now focused on a district about ten miles from Central London. It's also believed the planes are being used to study the movements of Jihadi John's suspected Midlands associates. An intelligence services source said the delicate detection equipment on board the planes had previously been used successfully to work out a suspected terrorist's computer password because of the heat signature left on the keys. The intelligence source said the surveillance plane had recently been used over Birmingham in relation to Junaid Hussain - who is suspected of being one of the so-called 'Beatles' holding hostages. Defiant: A fluttering ISIS flag is flown over a hill in Tel Abyad, on the Syrian-Turkish border. The area, which is in the heart of the Raqqa countryside, has been the subject of numerous coalition airstrikes . The planes are understood to be military aircraft which are sometimes used by the police to find escaped prisoners or stolen vehicles. The US Senate has also offered a £6 million reward to anyone providing information that could lead to the capture of Jihadi John. A team of more than a dozen US investigators from an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force flew to the UK, where they are working with MI5 and anti-terrorist officers from the Metropolitan Police Force to identify the man. It is believed family members of Jihadi John have been interviewed by Met officers and an FBI agent. The source said Jihadi John was known to the security services even before he went to Syria, but had been regarded as a 'low-level player'. It is believed he did know some of the terrorists convicted in the 2006 'liquid bomb' plot to blow up ten airliners bound from the UK to the US in mid-flight over the Atlantic.","FBI Director James Comey would not reveal the man's identity .

"Police are investigating the rape of two female students and a serious sex assault of a third at the prestigious Royal Agricultural University. Three male students have been arrested in connection with the alleged attacks on the night of a summer ball to mark end-of-year exams. A university source told The Mail on Sunday that the alleged attacks took place at a private property in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, after the group had spent the night celebrating at the May Ball. The three victims were aged 19, 20 and 21. The university confirmed that three male students have been suspended. The Royal Agricultural University in Gloucestershire, known as the Oxbridge of the countryside, where the alleged attacks are said to have taken place . A university source, who did not want to be named, said: ‘The ball was, as usual, a riotous occasion, with everyone throwing a considerable amount of alcohol down their throats.We’ve got 1,200 students here and a good many of them were at the ball, as well as quite  a few ex-students and staff. There’s never any trouble normally, beyond people letting their hair down and having a good time. ‘We are all extremely shocked by what has happened.’ The internationally renowned university, which until 2013 was known as the Royal Agricultural College, is rated the Oxbridge of agricultural studies and is often attended by the sons and daughters of wealthy and titled landed gentry. The ball was hosted by the university’s student union, which describes the annual event on its website as ‘the biggest ball of the year and the main event in the social diary’. It adds: ‘With live bands and top DJs, a funfair and partying from dusk ’til dawn.’ A police spokesperson said: ‘Three students from the Royal Agricultural University were arrested on Sunday May 25 in Cirencester in connection with an investigation into alleged sexual assaults. They have been bailed respectively until July 29, 30 and 31 to return to a police station as part of the investigation.’ Prince Charles congratulating a student, not connected with the case, at the Royal Agricultural University . The Royal Agricultural University, founded in 1845, is ranked by the influential Complete University Guide as the fifth safest in the UK. It was the first agricultural college in the English-speaking world. Former students include political commentator Jonathan Dimbleby, Princess Anne’s ex-husband Captain Mark Phillips, the late champion horse trainer Sir Henry Cecil and racehorse trainers Nicky Henderson and Andrew Balding, who is the brother of TV and radio presenter Clare. The university provides more than 30 land-based undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses for students from almost 50 countries worldwide and is, according to the Complete University Guide, often described as ‘the Oxbridge of the countryside’. On the Royal Agricultural University website, ex-student union chairman Nick Pain is quoted as follows: ‘The Student Union motto is Work Hard, Play Hard!, and Ciren students certainly live up to the hype!’ The historic university’s main quadrangle sits alongside a 16th Century tithe barn and farmhouse, in 25 acres of manicured grounds. The university operates two farms in the area. Students can study a range of courses rooted in agriculture, business, food production and equine management to Masters degree level. The university motto is ‘Avorum Cultus Pecorumque’, meaning ‘Caring for the fields and the beasts’. Since 2008, the university has seen a 49 per cent rise in applications and is ranked top in the UK for investing in campus facilities.

"Stevan Jovetic showed just why Manchester City are refusing to consider letting him return to Italy just a year after arriving from Fiorentina for £22million as the Premier League champions demolished AC Milan in Pittsburgh. The Montenegro forward has been strongly linked with a move to Inter Milan following a forgettable first season in England in which he spent much of his time on the treatment table, making a total of two Premier League starts. But Manuel Pellegrini insists that Jovetic is going nowhere and City duly demolished Inter’s neighbours by scoring four goals inside the opening 26 minutes at Heinz Field. Jovetic made a key contribution to an emphatic win, scoring twice and only missing out on a hat-trick because another well-taken effort was ruled out for offside.

Maybe there are a lot of rumours about his future but Stevan will stay with us.' As good as Jovetic and City were last night, Milan defended atrociously. They looked every inch a fallen giant that finished eighth in Serie A last season and lost their opening game in this International Champions Cup competition 3-0 to Olympiacos last week. When they met City in the Audi Cup in Munich last summer, they were five down before half-time before recovering to 5-3 and this encounter had similar hallmarks. City threatened to run riot even though they left Joe Hart, Yaya Toure, David Silva and James Milner to work on their fitness back at the club’s training base in New Jersey. They went ahead after 12 minutes when Jesus Navas slipped the ball through to Jovetic in the right-hand channel. Former Chelsea defender Alex was painfully slow to react and Adil Rami could not get across in time to prevent the City forward steering the ball inside Michael Agazzi’s near post. Sinclair doubled the lead two minutes later when Rami made a mess of dealing with Gael Clichy’s cross from the right, and he hooked the loose ball beyond Agazzi into the top corner. Bruno Zuculini should have made it three when Aleksandar Kolarov’s cross found him unmarked in front of goal but the next was not long in coming as Navas attempted to meet Jovetic’s crossfield pass with an ambitious bicycle kick which took a deflection off Mattia De Sciglio and crept in at the near post.

Nigerian triallist Kelechi Iheanacho, still not sufficiently signed up to City’s books to warrant a name on the back of his shirt, then scored his second goal in as many games to make it 4-0. There seemed little danger when the ball fell to the teenage striker on the edge of the area but he needed almost no backlift to send in a left-foot shot that Agazzi could only help on its way into the net. A linesman’s flag chalked off an even better finish from Jovetic before Sulley Muntari pulled one back for Milan, tapping in at the far post from Bryan Cristante’s corner. Half-time storms caused the restart to be held up by half an hour as players and fans sheltered from the lightning, which was perhaps appropriate given that Milan were preparing to introduce explosive striker Mario Balotelli off the bench against his old club.

Balotelli had the ball in the net within 10 minutes only to see it ruled out for offside but it was a more lively Milan in the second half who threatened to further reduce City’s lead. However, Jovetic killed off any hopes of a comeback in the 58th minute with his second goal of the game. There was still plenty of work to do when the Montenegrin met Kolarov’s low cross, and Jovetic dinked the ball past one defender with an exquisite touch of his right foot and despatched it into the net with his left.

'I've shown in my time at Liverpool sentiment doesn't come into it for me. I pick Gerrard because I still think he can influence a game of football for us.

"Businessman Donald Trump and comedian Russell Brand engaged in a nasty Twitter spat on Thursday. The digital fight started when Trump tweeted that the Forgetting Sarah Marshall star is a 'major loser.' Brand, however, hit back - and eventually suggested that Trump is not the entrepreneur he has claimed to be, by linking to an an article that mentioned his multi-million dollar inheritance and financial aid from the US government. 'I watched Russell Brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night—what the hell do people see in Russell—a major loser!' Trump first wrote. Trump's comments came three days after Brand appeared on 'Late Show with David Letterman' on Monday. Brand is not scheduled as a guest this week on 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'. Scroll down for video . Attack: Donald Trump called comedian Russell Brand 'a major loser' on Twitter Thursday . Split: Pop star Katy Perry and Russell Brand were married in 2010 and legally divorced in 2012 . Insult: Trump posted this message slamming Brand on Tuesday . Trump then published another tweet, which read '.@katyperry must have been drunk when she married Russell Brand @rustyrockets – but he did send me a really nice letter of apology!' It was not immediately clear what 'letter of apology' Trump was referring to. Perry and Brand were married in 2010 and divorced two years later, with Perry telling Vogue in June 2013 that Brand announced his intention to divorce in a 2011 New Year's Eve text message. Brand soon retaliated and responded to Trump's second message with jokes about Trump's sobriety and his much-lampooned hairline. '.@realDonaldTrump are you drunk when you write these tweets? Or does that foam you spray on your bald head make you high?' he tweeted. Brand later tweeted '.@realDonaldTrump I don't think your daddy left you any witty ripostes, and everything you have you inherited.' Included in that tweet was a link to an excerpt from 'The Self-Made Myth: The Truth About How Government Helps Individuals and Businesses Succeed' - which disputed Trump's image that he independently built a real estate empire. Trump inherited between $40million and $200million from his father Fred Trump - who himself received government funds in both the Great Depression and World War Two for projects, according to the excerpt. Counterattack: Brand replied to Trump's message about his marriage to Katy Perry with jokes about Trump's sobriety and his hairline . Strike back: Brand eventually linked to an an article that mentioned Trump's multimillion-dollar from his father inheritance and financial aid from the US government . Fighting words: Brand also linked to a second article which slammed Trump on several fronts . When Donald Trump was head of The Trump Organization in 1990 and the company faced a $5billion debt, 'The survival of the company was made possible only by a bailout pact agreed upon in August of that same year by some 70 banks, allowing Trump to defer on nearly $1 billion in debt, as well as to take out second and third mortgages on almost all of his properties,' the book excerpt argued. 'If it were not for the collective effort of all banks and parties involved in that 1990 deal, Trump’s business would have gone bankrupt and failed.' Brand later tweeted '.@realDonaldTrump Also -' and included a link to an April 2011 opinion article from The Atlantic which slammed Trump on several fronts. That article quoted 'a former Deutsche Bank employee familiar with Trump from this $640-million deal gone awry on the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. Trump was sued to collect on a $40-million personal guarantee that was part of the deal.' Direct address: Trump tweeted at Katy Perry 'I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried - he looks really bad. Russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost!' Trump went on to Tweet at Perry following Brand's links . Silence: Perry has so far not responded to the feud on Twitter . '[The Chicago deal] was pretty minor given all the other things going on at the time,' the ex-employee told The Atlantic. 'Real estate developers do default from time to time. But this guy has been doing it for 20 years, failing. Remember the Trump Shuttle? That's why he'll never run. His finances just won't hold up to scrutiny. It's pretty well known in financial circles that this guy is a deadbeat.' Included in the piece was an April 2011 NBC report around the time Trump considered running for president, which reported Trump had faced multiple casino bankruptcies and lawsuits from various business ventures. Following Brand's tweets, Trump later pulled Perry more directly into the spat, writing '.@katyperry Katy, what the hell were you thinking when you married loser Russell Brand. There is a guy who has got nothing going, a waste!' He also tweeted '.@katyperry I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried - he looks really bad. Russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost!'

"Sacked Manchester United manager David Moyes is to be questioned by police over claims he attacked another drinker outside an upmarket wine bar. Moyes, 51, allegedly erupted in a rage after he was subjected to a torrent of abuse as he arrived with friends. One drinker is said to have goaded him about his recent sacking by Manchester United. Witnesses say Moyes suddenly turned round and lunged at Joshua Gillibrand, 23, hitting him on the side of the head. There was a brief scuffle near the bar entrance, the pair were separated and Moyes was restrained by his friends who dragged him away until he had calmed down, they claimed.

I ended up face down on the floor. 'I felt I was going to die. There were tables flying everywhere and glass all over the place.' Mr Gillibrand suffered a lump on the side of his head and a bruised shoulder and went to hospital. On Thursday night police confirmed they had launched an investigation into the fracas and sources said they were set to speak to the former Premier League manager. The incident happened at around 10pm on Wednesday after Moyes and friends – including Derek Shaw, former chairman at Preston North End, one of Moyes’ previous clubs – had dined at Piccolino’s in Clitheroe, Lancashire, before going to the nearby Emporium wine bar. A group standing outside the bar began making abusive remarks when they saw Moyes, who was humiliatingly sacked as United manager last month after less than a year in charge and is understood to have left with a £4.5million pay off. A witness said: ‘Moyes started to head in with his mates but he was being barracked by drinkers outside. He was getting a bit of lip from a couple of blokes and then one guy, who was a bit drunk, said something about him being s*** and having never won anything. ‘Moyes kept his head down and carried on walking towards the door with his friends and everyone thought he was just ignoring the banter. But then stopped, turned on his heels and quickly marched back.’ Wine Bar: The alleged incident is said to have taken place at the Emporium in Clitheroe, Lancashire . Reveller: Mr Gillibrand claims he was attacked at just after 10pm last night after an incident outside the bar. He did not require hospital treatment . The man, who witnessed the end of the incident said: ‘Moyes had completely lost it and was bright purple in the face and quite clearly out of control. ‘No one could quite believe what had happened. We were stunned. He’s obviously had enough of all the abuse he’s been getting after his miserable season.’ Out and about: David Moyes with wife Pamela in December . Another witness, a 22-year-old man, said: ‘Josh was giving him banter, I think it might have been a chant about him leaving Manchester United, nothing very offensive, and initially Moyes just walked past him into the bar. ‘But moments later Moyes came back outside, squared up to Josh.’ The witness, an acquaintance of Mr Gillibrand, added: ‘Josh is a well-built lad but he’s not particularly mouthy, and he’s not really a football fan at all. I think he was too stunned at what had happened to react. ‘Afterwards Josh was really angry about it, he was saying he wanted to take it further.‘He was saying, “Whoa, I was only joking”. It’s amazing to think that someone who a few weeks ago was managing one of the world’s top football clubs was scuffling outside a bar on a Wednesday night in Clitheroe.’ Another friend of Mr Gillibrand said: ‘He was quite drunk and went up and said something to him like, “What are you doing around here?” ‘It didn’t go down at all well with Moyes who started swearing at him, so Josh said something like, “Well get out of town then”, and turned his back on him, which is when Moyes hit him in the back of the head.’ A police car was flagged down and officers dealt with the incident. Moyes was taken aside by the officers and spoken to. Mr Gillibrand’s mother Susan, 53, said her son had been shocked and had suffered a couple of bumps and bruises. She said: ‘Josh does not even like football.’ Last night Moyes, who lives near Preston, declined to comment over the incident. A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: ‘Officers attended the bar at about 10pm on Wednesday, May 21, and it was reported that a 23-year-old local man had been assaulted by a 51-year-old man. ‘Inquiries are ongoing and we are speaking to a number of people to try to establish the circumstances. No one has been arrested at this stage.’ Sacking: Mr Moyes was hand picked by Sir Alex Ferguson to succeed him as boss but lost his job at Old Trafford after nine months .

"Labour leader Ed Miliband was today hounded out of an Edinburgh shopping centre as a campaign walkabout became overrun by protesters. He was repeatedly branded a 'f***ing liar' by Yes campaigners who drowned out his supporters with cries of 'bow down to your imperial master. Mr Miliband pleaded for a 'civilised' debate with two days of campaigning left before the referendum, before being rushed out of the door by his aides, who were left 'visibly shaken' by the incident. At one point he became trapped outside a hairdressers called 'Supercuts', leading opponents to chant: 'Vote No for Supercuts, vote No for permanent austerity'. Scroll down for exclusive video . Labour leader Ed Miliband was bundled out of an Edinburgh shopping centre after a planned walkabout became overrun by Yes protesters . A planned appearance on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh was abandoned in favour of the shopping centre visits, which quickly descended into chaos . Journalists and film crews jostled with protesters, who yelled 'f***ing liar' and 'traitor' at Mr Miliband . Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran tried to force the throng back as placard-wielding Yes and No protesters forced their way through the mall . Aides later said Labour campaigners were left 'visibly shaken' by the incident, after Mr Miliband was led away to safety . Labour MSP Kezia Dugdale revealed the mood in the campaign room after the ugly scenes in the mall . Mr Miliband had been due to appear at St James Shopping Centre in Edinburgh at 3.15pm, but arrived almost 45 minutes late. With Yes protesters outside chanting 'we don't need your f***ing union' and 'how many spare bedrooms has the Queen got?', Labour aides decided to stage the event inside the shopping centre. But he was unable to address the crowd and only managed to speak to members of the public caught in the furore. As Mr Miliband battled his way through the crowd, Yes protesters called out: 'This is what a political class looks like when it's dying.' The visit to Scotland's capital was supposed to be the main event in Mr Miliband's diary. But the extraordinary spectacle of the Labour leader being rushed into a car park lift came amid growing concern about threats of intimidation aimed at those opposed to independence. First Minister Alex Salmond admitted 'there are always idiots in a campaign' but insisted that '99 per cent of people participating in this campaign are behaving impeccably'. However, Labour MSP Kezia Dugdale wrote on Twitter after Mr Miliband's Edinburgh visit: 'Campaign room full of visibly shaken and upset folk who were in St James Centre - truly crappy day for democracy.' As a large crowd pushed him towards the shopping centre exit, Mr Miliband told journalists: ‘I think we have seen in parts of this campaign an ugly side to it from the Yes campaign. 'I think debate should be conducted in a civilised way, I think that’s very, very important, but I understand that passions run high.' The extraordinary scenes come amid growing claims of intimidation against people opposed to independence . Mr Miliband hit out at the 'ugly scenes' which have been orchestrated by the Yes campaign in recent days . Mr Miliband said he wanted the referendum campaign to be conducted in a 'civilised' way, but could barely be heard above the chanting around him . Ed Miliband became trapped outside a hairdressers called Supercuts . By Matt Chorley, in Edinburgh . It is difficult to know what Labour aides hoped to get out of Ed Miliband's walkabout in St James Shopping Centre. But surely it wasn't this. The Labour leader had been expected on the Royal Mile, but later changed plans to go to the shopping centre for 3.15pm. Outside a small group of Yes protesters chanted and laughed, mocking Mr Miliband before he'd even arrived. Almost half an hour later, aides emerged to tell waiting reporters that Mr Miliband would instead be appearing inside the mall. Camera crews scrambled, reporters began running, dodging between bewildered shoppers. But Mr Miliband's walkabout had ground to a halt. Surrounded by a pack, with Yes chants winning on volume alone, he grabbed anyone passing by who could not escape the melee. He had the grace to laugh when asked about intimidation, but this was a terrible spectacle, his plea for 'civilised' debate drawn out by heckles. The true low point was when he disappeared into the doorway of a hair salon called Supercuts, deep irony at a time when the SNP complains of Westminster cost-cutting. Mr Miliband went on: 'What I have enjoyed about this campaign, including today when I get the chance, is meeting people who are genuinely undecided.' He was also challenged over whether Gordon Brown is now the leader of the No campaign, after taking a more high profile role than both Mr Miliband and Better Together chief Alistair Darling. But Mr Miliband insisted:'He’s a very important part of this campaign, I think he has done a very good job. All of us are setting out that choice. 'I think all of us are doing our job in getting through to Labour voters. I think Gordon is playing his role, Johann Lamont is playing her role, Alistair Darling, all of us are setting out that big choice that we face.' A Labour campaigner, Clare Lally, said on Twitter: 'Upsetting scenes in Edinburgh at an event, I had to link arms with Monica Lennon to protect Johann Lamont and Margaret Curran #disgraceful.' Scottish nationalists are facing further accusations of bullying and intimidation as the independence debate turns increasingly bitter. ITV political editor Tom Bradby said covering the referendum campaign had been a 'rather unpleasant experience'. Writing a blog, he added: 'My first major job as a correspondent was in Ireland in the early nineties and, despite the fact that there was a bitter war going on all round me that took many lives, I experienced virtually no personal hostility at all from anyone. They didn’t lob accusations of bias around every time you asked a question either.' BBC Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark last night had to issue an on air apology after a live broadcast was interrupted by a heckler. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander was also heckled during a No campaign rally in Glasgow, and most shockingly of all, Respect MP George Galloway claims he was ‘threatened with a bullet’ during the event. Ms Wark was presenting Newsnight from an outdoor studio in Dundee when her broadcast was interrupted by someone shouting and swearing. The interruptions took place throughout the programme, first when the journalist was interviewing actor Brian Cox and later when she was on air with a panel of industry experts. Ms Wark told viewers: ‘We apologise for the swearing, I’m afraid it’s beyond our control.’ Mr Cox, when asked about negative elements of the Yes campaign, told Ms Wark: ‘You get head-bangers, you’ve just had one behind you now.’ After escaping from the shopping centre, Mr Miliband crossed over a pedestrian bridge before disappearing into the lift of a multistorey car park . Mrs Curran tried to shield Mr Miliband from the crowd, as he became trapped between protesters and film crews . Aides rushed Mr Miliband into the lift of a car park and spirited him away, with photographers in pursuit . While Mr Miliband faced down protesters, David Cameron was in London holding a meting with Tory ministers Patrick McLoughlin (left), Iain Duncan Smith (second left), William Hague (third left), and aide Ed Llewellyn (front, centre) The BBC has come under fierce criticism from nationalists who accuse the corporation of being biased in its coverage. Up to 1,000 independence supporters gathered outside the broadcaster’s headquarters in Glasgow on Sunday, with many also calling for BBC political editor Nick Robinson to be sacked - action that was praised by Alex Salmond as 'joyous'. Respect MP George Galloway said he was threatened with a 'bullet' at a No rally in Glasgow last night. Up to 1,000 Yes campaigners protested outside the BBC HQ in Glasgow on Sunday against allegations of biased coverage . Thousands of Yes campaigners gathered in George Square in Glasgow tonight for a rally in support of independence . Graffiti saying 'Vote Yes or Else?' was daubed on walls in Aberdeen, including on a house on the corner of Osborne Place and Prince Arthur Street . An Edinburgh Yes voter had 'coward' scratched into his front door in an act of vandalism. Former Defence Secretary John Reid accused the Yes side of using the ‘language of abuse’ towards women who speak up for union, and he alleged that Alex Salmond’s supporters had organised ‘street mobs’ to intimidate No campaigners. Mr Reid made the comments after Harry Potter author JK Rowling and lingerie boss Michelle Mone were subjected to abuse after expressing support for the No campaign. No campaign sources have claimed that a Better Together activist in Aberdeen was warned he would feel like a 'Christian missionary in Syria' after a Yes vote. A nationalist was also reported to have turned to his son in front of unionist activists in Glasgow and said: 'One day, remind me to tell you what Mussolini did to collaborators.' And an English activist in Glasgow was told to 'get out of my country', while a Spanish woman, who had lived in Scotland for 20 years, was spat on while leaving a No rally and told to go home.","Labour leader abandons walkabout after becoming overwhelmed by crowds .

"A Yale graduate whose life was tragically cut short when she was killed in a car accident shortly after her graduation has just been awarded a prestigious literary prize. Marina Keegan was awarded the Goodreads Choice Awards non-fiction book for 2014 for the posthumously published The Opposite of Loneliness: Essays and Stories. This after an essay she wrote for the Yale Daily News went viral following her death, and publishing house Simon & Schuster asked to release a collection of her works. Scroll down to read Keegan's essay . Heralded: Marina Keegan (left) was awarded the Goodreads Choice Awards non-fiction book for 2014 for the posthumously published The Opposite of Loneliness: Essays and Stories (right) Tragedy: Keegan died just five days after she graduated from Yale in 2012 in a car accident (above) Cleared: Marina's boyfriend Michael Gocksch (right) had been driving at the time of the crash but was not speeding or under the influence so was cleared in his girlfriend's death . Keegan had just graduated five days earlier in 2012 when her boyfriend, Michael Gocksch, crashed his car after falling asleep at the wheel while the couple was driving in Massachusetts. Gocksch, who survived the crash, was not speeding or under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the accident, and did not face any charges. Even though she had just graduated, Keegan was already well on her way to an illustrious literary career, having already scored a job with The New Yorker. She had studied English at Yale and graduated magna cum laude from the Ivy League institution. The week before her death she published an essay in her school paper urging members of her generation to 'make something happen to this world,' which went viral with more than 1.4 million hits according to The Independent. It was this work, and others, the publisher Simon & Schuster says 'captures the hope, uncertainty, and possibility of her generation' that has made her into what they call an 'icon of her generation.' 'We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I could say that’s what I want in life. What I’m grateful and thankful to have found at Yale, and what I’m scared of losing when we wake up tomorrow and leave this place.' 'We’re so young. We’re so young. We’re twenty-two years old. We have so much time. There’s this sentiment I sometimes sense, creeping in our collective conscious as we lay alone after a party, or pack up our books when we give in and go out – that it is somehow too late. That others are somehow ahead. More accomplished, more specialized. More on the path to somehow saving the world, somehow creating or inventing or improving. That it’s too late now to BEGIN a beginning and we must settle for continuance, for commencement.' 'We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I’d say that’s how I feel at Yale. How I feel right now. Here. With all of you. In love, impressed, humbled, scared. And we don’t have to lose that.' 'We’re in this together, 2012. Let’s make something happen to this world.'

"If you're out and about on the streets of Britain this week you might want to keep an eye on where you're going to avoid bumping into the invisible people that may be lining its streets. No Dynamo has not been up to his old tricks again, but rather a body artist who has been making her subjects 'disappear' into famous landmarks. Trina Merry, 34, spends up to eight hours painstakingly painting the bodies of models so that they are almost invisible to the eye by blending them into the backgrounds of familiar UK landmarks. Scroll down for video . Lost in London: Body artist Trina Merry paints models' bodies so that they blend seamlessly into famous landmarks . From traditional British sights like Stonehenge and Westminster Abbey to 21st century vistas such as the London Eye and the capital s modern metallic skyline. Originally from the USA Trina started her body paintings in New York last year, painting female subjects so that they blended in with the city's landmarks. Patient painting: It can take Trina up to eight hours painting the bodies of her subjects . Work in progress: Trina often gets stopped by passersby asking lots of questions about her work . Big Ben and his little friend: Once completed the models must stand perfectly still in order to line up and blend in with their landmark . In NYC Trina had the law on her side as the city allows people to strip off in public for the purpose of artistic expression. However, she had to do some serious negotiating with London police in order to complete her work. The authorities were not the only obstacle that Trina faced as her work attracted fascinated crowds of bystanders and hundreds of confused tourists who were all keen to ask questions. For Trina the process creates a new way of viewing people in the cities they live in. This job has legs: Trina says the body paintings give a more reflective view of a person in their surroundings . Overseas art: Trina started her body artistry back home in the USA but has since branched out to the UK, here a man is almost invisible against the Southbank's Globe theatre . Is there wheely someone there? A man is almost unrecognisable against the London Eye . 'They're softly in the background, and you've got more of a reflective view of the person within the landscape.' The process of creating each work requires great patience. It is a carefully-planned ritual, which involves waiting until there is no chance of rain which could wash off the meticulously detailed designs. 'It feels great to be painted,' said Jessica Mellow one of Trina's New York models at the time of being painted. 'You feel the transformation process. The brush itself, it's really soft. It feels more like a massage.' Now you see him: A model bodypainted into the background of the stunning Colonnades of Bath . Soggy canvas: Trina has to contend with many obstacles including the weather . Barely there: This subject seems at one with Stonehenge in Wiltshire . Where'd you go? This detailed painting sees the model vanish completely into Dunluce Castle in County Antrim, Ireland .","Trina Merry paints bodies so that they blend into famous landmarks .

"Farmer Dinah Thompson is used to counting sheep at this time of year but she had to double check the one-in-a-million arrival of these five lambs. The incredibly rare quintuplets have shocked the world of agriculture after being born to a hardy ewe at a farm in Shropshire. Ms Thompson, 55, has had the mother sheep, called Mrs Holmes, for three years and every lambing season so far she has given birth to twin lambs. Little miracles: Shropshire farmer Dinah Thompson, 55, was amazed when her prize ewe 'Mrs Holmes' delivered a quintuplet of tiny lambs this week . Shock: Ms Thompson was expecting her prized ewe to produce triplets so was stunned when five babies arrived . This year, a scan had shown that the Kerry Texel ewe was due to have triplets so after three new-borns arrived Dinah left Mrs Holmes to it and went off for a cup of coffee. Dinah said: 'I checked on the mum at 10.15pm and saw she was having two small lambs. 'I knew she was having triplets so I waited for number three to arrive and when it did I went off for a cup of coffee. 'There was a bit of a noise in the shed and when I returned 20 minutes later there were five little lambs who were all alive and healthy and they are absolutely adorable.' The lambs all weigh just over three pounds each but Dinah is having to bottle feed three of them with formula milk every four hours as Mrs Holmes only has two teats. Dinah, who has worked on the family-run Coombe Farm near Ludlow, Shropshire, all her life, said: 'They're all doing very well. 'We have her mum in one pen and the lambs are in a little pen next to her, so they can keep in contact. 'I have never seen anything like it before. I've had times when four lambs have been born but never five, it is incredibly rare. 'The fact they are all alive and pretty even sized is amazing. 'We haven't quite got round to naming them yet but were thinking of taking some of the names from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.' Stats amazing: There is just a one-in-a-million chance of a ewe producing quintuplets . Dinah is expecting 178 ewes on her farm to give birth to about 340 lambs, most of which will end up as roast dinners in the future. Oliver Cartwright, a spokesman for the National Farmers Union, said: 'Quintuplets are very rare and I bet it came as a real surprise especially as it was not picked up on the scans ahead of lambing. 'We hear of a lot about twins and triplets that are born on farms, but surviving quintuplets are something very special and unusual. 'This sort of thing may be a once in a generation experience. 'At the moment it's a busy time for sheep farmers. Helping to rear the quintuplets will help to ease the pressure on the mum.'","Shropshire farmer Dinah Thompson, 55, left stunned my mammoth arrival ."

"Algeria are through to the knockout stages of the World Cup for the very first time, so many fans will be unfamiliar with the history of the north African nation. Here, TOM RODDY helps shine a light on Algeria's colourful past and present ahead of their last-16 clash against Germany. Speaking of the Germans, this could prove to be a feisty clash. Read on to find out why... Star: Algeria striker Sofiane Feghouli will lead the line against Germany in the last 16 of the World Cup . 1 Algeria's first opponents at the 1982 World Cup in Spain were none other than European Champions West Germany, who boasted a squad with the likes of Paul Breitner, Lothar Matthaus, Hansi Muller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. The result was far from what was expected. Algeria played vibrant football, shocking the Germans with a 2-1 victory. 2 The 1982 finals began with joy but ended in controversial despair for Algeria. With West Germany and Austria’s match set to be played after the Algerians' final group game, the two sides knew a 1-0 win for the Germans would put both through, and the Algerians would be eliminated on goal difference. Unsurprisingly, that was exactly what happened. The match has become known in Germany as the 'non-aggression pact of Gijon' and rather less favourably in Algeria as the Anschluss. It led to a change in scheduling for the final group games, beginning at the 1986 finals in Mexico, FIFA ordered the final games of the group to be played simultaneously to avoid a repeat of the match in Gijon. Farce: Horst Hrubesch (left) heads West Germany into the lead against Austria in 1982 . 3 Algeria’s only goal in the 1986 finals in Mexico came from one Djamel Zidane, uncle of France legend Zinedine Zidane. Djamel featured in the impressive campaign in 1982 as well. Now assistant to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid, Zizou’s parents originated from Algeria but migrated to France in the 1950s. A supposed friendly fixture between the two countries in October 2001 ended in acrimony. Zidane received death threats prior to the game and was taunted throughout. The tie was eventually abandoned due to a pitch invasion by young French-Arabs. Glory: Djamel Zidane (right) celebrates victory over Germany with coach Mahiedieme Khalef and Mehdi Cerbah . 4 Algeria’s impressive performance in Brazil this summer contrasts dramatically to their dismal campaign in South Africa four years ago. In a group with England, USA and Slovenia, Algeria were soon on their way home with one solitary point from a bore-draw with England, and without scoring a single goal. In fact, Sofiane Feghouli’s penalty in the twenty-fourth minute against Belgium this month was Algeria’s first goal at a World Cup in twenty-eight years. Raising the bar: Algeria's bore draw with England was about as bad as international football can get . 5 One of the stars of the 1982 World Cup was Lakhdar Belloumi, scorer of the winning goal against West Germany. Belloumi had received praise from Pele and was supposed to be on his way to Juventus in 1985, a team which included the great Michel Platini. The move ended up falling apart when the striker broke his leg in the African Champions’ Cup. Heroes: Lakhdar Belloumi (front row, fifth left) and the Algeria team selected for the 1982 World Cup in Spain . 6 Along with nine other players, Rachid Mekhloufi left his successful career in France with Saint Etienne in 1958 to take part in the first squad of the Algerian National Liberation Front, which sought independence from the French. Technically, Mekhloufi and co were playing for a country which did not exist. But regardless of the chaos in Algeria, the team continued to play and in 1962 Algeria was officially declared independent from France with a national football programme created. Who said football was just a game? 7 It is believed that Sofiane Feghouli was a transfer target for Liverpool in 2013 and Manchester United in 2012. The forward is currently playing in La Liga with Valencia and assisted eight goals in the 2013/14 season. Prayer: Faouzi Ghoulam (right) runs to join his team-mates in celebration of Feghouli's goal against Belgium . 8 As a youngster, Islam Slimani would often go fishing using a plastic bottle tied to several pieces of string because he could not afford either a rod or net. Slimani, Algeria’s top goalscorer in Brazil this summer, netted against Russia on Thursday to knock out Fabio Capello’s side from the World Cup. Passion: Algerianl fans celebrate on the Canebiere in Marseille after qualifying for the last 16 . 9 Former Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane has shown his support for Algeria. He said, ‘Algeria has always been in my heart. They (France and Algeria) are the two teams that I have always supported and that I want to see win. Moment of madness: Zinedine Zidane (left) is one of the greatest players in history, despite this infamous clash . 10 Vahid Halilhodzic won the Champions League in 1997 - the African Champions League that is, with Morocco's Raja Casablanca. Halilhodzic has also been known to speak about himself in the third person. He once informed his critical press that he had three million fans on Facebook and said 'So you see now that some people like Vahid.'

"Luis Suarez has opened up about the Steven Gerrard slip that halted Liverpool's Premier League momentum and went a long way to depriving them of their first league title in 24 years. Liverpool lost 2-0 to Chelsea in their third-to-last game of the 2013/14 season, and Gerrard's error to gift Demba Ba's goal loosened their grip on the title. The Reds then let a three-goal lead slip at Crystal Palace, before a win against Newcastle on the last day of the season; by then though, the title had gone to Manchester City. Suarez, in his new autobiography released on Thursday, has revealed his thoughts on that title-changing moment at Anfield. Steven Gerrard's slip gifts Demba Ba the ball, which he duly accepted to score for Chelsea last April . It was the moment that took the momentum from Liverpool, and halted their charge for the Premier League . Liverpool went to Selhurst Park in their following match, and squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Palace . 'If I had been in Stevie's shoes, I don't know if I would have been able to carry on playing. Emotionally, it must have been very, very hard. 'In the previous weeks, so much had been said about him, the expectation had built so much, the talk had been about him leading Liverpool, his club, to a first title in over 20 years, on the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, in which his cousin had died, and then that happens. 'The captain, the former youth-teamer, the one-club man, a Scouser born and bred, and he was the unlucky one to make a crucial mistake. 'I'm convinced that if Chelsea had not scored like that, they would not have scored at all. And once you are a goal down against them, it's virtually impossible.'

Suarez is now plying his trade in La Liga for Barcelona; pictured vs Ajax in the Champions League this week . Suarez left Liverpool at the end of that season, moving to Barcelona for £75 million, and this Saturday his old side, Gerrard included, will host Chelsea for the first time since the incident at the back end of last season. Things are different this time, with an unbeaten Chelsea very much the team in control. Jose Mourinho's side have won eight and drawn two of their first 10 Premier League matches. There is a long way to go, but Liverpool need a turning point in their season if they are to awake from their poor start, which sees them currently in seventh place in the Premier League.","Steven Gerrard gifted Demba Ba a goal at the back end of last season .

"A striking photo taken by an environmental conservation group in Queensland has gone viral. The picture features a group of people with their heads buried in the sand to highlight the lack of action by the Australian Government on climate change. The words 'Townsville salutes the Australian Government for their achievements in combating climate change' are printed alongside the image. The image was taken on The Strand Beach in Townsville, northern Queensland, and has featured on a medley of sites around the world, including eminent American site Buzzfeed . Activists gather before the picture is taken. Head co-ordinator of the NQCC said the image was arranged by production company Cranky Curlew . Wendy Tubman (above) from the NQCC says coal mining is the biggest environmental threat facing Australia . Taken on The Strand Beach in Townsville, Northern Queensland, the picture has featured on a medley of sites around the world, including eminent American site Buzzfeed, which titled an article on the image as 'The One Picture That Perfectly Sums Up World Action On Climate Change'. The image was a collaboration between production team Cranky Curlew as well as the North Queensland Conservation Council. The NQCC organised a local climate change protest on Sunday that coincided with The People's Climate March In New York - the largest climate protest in history - which attracted more than 300,000 people. The co-ordinator of the NQCC Wendy Tubman told Daily Mail Australia: 'We wanted to make a comment on the total lack of responsibility from the Australian Government. They are acting like climate change isn't there.' Ms Tubman explained that she wanted to reach as many people as possible with the image. 'We wanted to get this out to many people as possible. 'That's the real advantage of internet based activism: once you've seen it, you can share it with your own circles, and it can quickly grow to a much larger audience than a protest.' The production company that took the photo - Cranky Curlew Productions - used the protest on Sunday as the basis for the photo. 'They had planned it all thoroughly beforehand, arranged for all the participants to take part, so when it came down to capturing the image it happened very smoothly. People were happy to take part.' Activists gather for a protest on Sunday in Townsville . Head of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon at the opening of the 2014 Climate Change Summit in New York, where he warned that 'humanity has never faced a greater challenge than climate change' An unidentified woman performed a similar act last week when she buried her head in the sand and held up a 'No Gas' sign . She says the major environmental threat facing Australia is mining. 'Coal mining is the biggest contributor to climate change. The Australian Governments support for this industry - which is not only dying but deeply damaging to our way of life - is the equivalent of supporting the tobacco industry.' Last week, a woman engaged in a similar protest on Bondi Beach, burying her head in the sand and brandishing a sign reading 'NO GAS'.  The unidentified woman was apparently protesting the use of Coal Seam Gas, a naturally occurring substance which can only be accessed through mining. The news comes as the Head of the United Nations, Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, has warned that 'humanity has never faced a greater challenge than climate change', at the opening of the 2014 Climate Change Summit in New York. On Sunday the Foreign Affairs Minister, Julie Bishop, attended a meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change in New York. She confirmed Australia's commitment to reduce its emissions by 5 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020. By contrast, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by the United States discusses a 30 per cent reduction in emissions by 2025, and recommendied other nations make similar cuts.

"Wayne Rooney will undergo a scan on his injured knee on Wednesday while the rest of the Manchester United team-mates get ready for their Christmas party. Rooney missed Tuesday night's 2-1 win against Stoke City after banging into an advertising hoarding at the end of their previous match with Hull, and manager Louis van Gaal is now waiting to see if his captain can make their next match at Southampton on Monday. 'We will have to wait until Wednesday to say anything about him (Rooney) because you never know with the knee,' said Van Gaal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: Rooney and Di Maria knocks not too heavy . Wayne Rooney watches Manchester United beat Stoke from the stands after injuring his knee against Hull .

Belgium international Fellaini runs off to celebrate his second goal for United in front of the home fans . 'My opinion is that it is not so heavy (bad) but I am not a doctor so we have to wait for the scan and then we know more.' In addition, record signing Angel di Maria is due to miss the trip to the south coast with a hamstring injury. 'Di Maria is not so heavy but of course he shall not play against Southampton but you never know,' added van Gaal, who has also confirmed Dutch international Daley Blind may be able to return by the end of the month after suffering a knee injury on international duty with Holland. 'In December we will see light at the end of the tunnel,' smiled the United boss. Rooney will still hope to attend United's Christmas bash which will be held in good cheer after the club's fourth win in a row.

Without Rooney, Di Maria, Luke Shaw, Phil Jones, Rafael, Blind and other injured players, United are digging deep to Van Gaal's delight. 'The fighting spirit is fantastic when you see the team, and that is why the fans are also excited,' he said. 'We have come back from bad results many times and against Stoke the referee should have whistled at 1-0 (when Assaidi challenged Fellaini) but he didn't and they scored. But we fought back again and fought til the end when we also had the long balls to Mr (Peter) Crouch, and we have survived. 'It is good for the players, the team and for me, and the party we have tomorrow!' 'I was not happy with the performance in the first half, we were not aggressive enough, and the last few moments were not necessary.' Van Gaal was referring to a late Stoke surge which saw the previously underused David de Gea make saves from Mame Diouf and Marko Arnautovic before Diouf struck Ashley Young on the goal-line.

'We were disappointed obviously with the award of the second goal, from our point of view we clearly thinks it's offside,' he said. 'The lad Rojo, it doesn't matter if he doesn't touch it, he is clearly interfering with play. He was ahead of the play in an offside position, so the referee and the assistant-referee should have cancelled that out. So that is disappointing for us, but we didn't allow that disappointment to effect us. We went again and the episodes at the end were unbelievable. It is the luck we have been having at the moment.

"As President Obama's signature health insurance overhaul effort began to enroll new participants on Monday, some states running their own insurance exchanges saw huge levels of website traffic but paltry interest in signing up. California, the ultimate blue state whose federal lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in support of Obamacare, turned less than 1 per cent of its Web visits into 'Covered California' participants on Tuesday. 'We had over 5.7 million hits to our website as of 3 p.m. yesterday,' Covered California spokeswoman Kelsey Caldwell told MailOnline Wednsday. '7,700 consumers began their application process yesterday. ... 4,143 applications are pending,' she added. 'We received 23,269 calls yesterday to our service center.' Caldwell couldn't say how many of the 5.7 million website hits were from unique Californians. But assuming 712,500 online visitors saw eight different Web pages each, the sign-up rate was 0.58 per cent. Obama-prayer? The White House is hoping millions of Americans will sign up for government-brokered health insurance, but so far there's no indication that the throngs of website lookie-lous are applyling . Connecticut saw a similarly low rate of interest. Democratic Congressman Jim Himes tweeted after 8:30 p.m. Monday that his state's health exchange had 'received 28k visitors, and took 167 applications for health insurance. Day 1.' That indicates just 0.59 per cent of Connecticut residents who sought information about their state's Obamacare program on Monday decided to become part of it, according to Access Health CT spokeswoman Kathleen Tallarita. New York Department of Health executive director Donna Frescato said in a statement that . 'more than 12,000 business owners and individuals from across the state . have shopped online for low-cost health insurance plans ... and the site . has received nearly 30 million web visits.' Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti urged Californians to enroll in health care insurance through the Covered California program, but his pleas may be falling on deaf ears . A . spokesman didn't respond to a request for clarification about whether . those 12,000 people completed applications for health coverage. If they . did, and if each 'web visit' corresponded to a New Yorker who saw 8 . pages, the state's enrollment rate would be the lowest of all – 0.32 per cent. The low numbers of new enrollees stand in stark contrast to the robust website traffic statistics, suggesting that day-one anxieties about non-functioning online portals may have been overblown. Only 14 states have opted to run their own health insurance exchanges. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is handling signup duties for the other 36 states and the District of Columbia. 'Starting today,' President Obama said Tuesday during a White House Rose Garden event, 'you and your friends and your family and your coworkers can get covered, too. Just visit healthcare.gov, and there you can compare insurance plans, side by side, the same way you’d shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon.' But his administration isn't saying how many Americans signed up online so far. Access Health CT, the Connecticut state Obamacare insurance exchange, signed up just 167 members of the public on the first day of open enrollment, despite reports that the website was available and loading quickly . On Wednesday Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters said the main Obamacare website had served 4.7 million unique visitors, adding to 190,000 phone calls and 104,000 online chats sessions that administrators had supervised. 'Millions want to get covered,' according to the Obamacare system's main Twitter account on Wednesday afternoon. 'Americans across the country – millions of Americans – are taking advantage of the opportunity to shop for affordable health insurance that they could not attain before now,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney insisted on Monday. But without enrollment figures, it's impossible to know whether Obamacare is seeing a flood of new customers or just a trickle. The White House did not respond to a request for those numbers. Shutdown mashup: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney briefed reporters on Wednesday, live-streamed on a website that the administration complained was partially inactive due to the government's slimmed down operations . Some states are seeing greater interest, with signup rates in single-digit percentages. Illinois reeived applications from 1.7 per cent of Web visitors. Rhode Island signed up 2.3 per cent. Kentucky reported receiving completed applications from 5.3 per cent. Staff at the Community Health Center in New Britain, Connecticut wore 'Get Obamacare' buttons during a launch event on Tuesday, but only 167 people statewide signed up that day . Vermont's participation rate is no more than 6 per cent, although that number may be deceiving.Emily Yahr, a public Information officer with Vermont Health Connect, told MailOnline that her state exchange's website had served 'about 20,300 unique visit[or]s,' resulting in 'just over 1,230 user accounts established.' But she couldn't say how many people submitted completed applications. Washington, D.C. government spokesperson Richard Sorian said Wednesday that 15,452 unique visitors had seen his agency's DC Health Link website, and that new accounts were created for 4,171 individuals and families, and 136 small businesses – a rate of nearly 28 per cent. He, too, offered no numbers showing how many of those users applied for health insurance after they created accounts. But Sorian did suggest that number was not as impressive. 'We don’t expect people to fully enroll this early,' he said. Glitch du jour: The Massachusetts health care exchange, home of 'RomneyCare,' suffered from technical problems Wednesday even though most state residents already have health insurance coverage . Minnesota's health insurance administration, MNSure, also said it had 'no enrollment numbers yet.' But spokeswoman Jenni Bowring-McDonough said the state's insurance exchange website was seeing an average of 50,000 hits on its website every hour since it launched – a 24-hour average of 1.2 million – from Minnesotans. Just 2,500 new accounts resulted. At an estimated 8 pages per visitor, that's an account-creation rate of less than 1.7 per cent. The number of actual applications would have been lower still. In a statement, the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange reported that 292 businesses had enrolled in its coverage plans but wouldn't say how many individual taxpayers are taking part. 'We don't have any of those numbers yet,' said spokeswoman Annie Holschuh. Media representatives for health insurance exchanges in Maryland, Oregon, Colorado, Idaho and Hawaii did not respond to requests for enrollment statistics. Massachusetts is running its own exchange but is expected to sign up few new enrollees since an existing program, created by former Governor Mitt Romney, already covers most state residents.","California's program registered an estimated 0.58 per cent of website visitors in its first day .

"A former food addict who had spent her whole life dreaming of romance shed an astonishing 12st 7lb - and fell in love for the first time. Hazel Dyson, 27, used to weigh 22st 7lb and, at her heaviest at the age of 21, had given up hope of ever having a boyfriend. Men insulted her size 26 figure, calling her 'massive' and 'disgusting' - leaving the ceramic artist convinced that she would be single forever. Scroll down for video . Hazel dropped from a size 26 and 22st 7lb (left) to a trim size 10 and 10st (right) But six years later, the size 10 beauty is in demand and is inundated with attention from men who are desperate to date her. Hazel, from Huddersfield, said: 'I'd struggled with my weight since I was a child, and by the time I was in secondary school, I was 15st. 'Over the years, my weight just ballooned and at 21, I was a size 26 and 22st 7lbs. 'All of my friends were really slim and pretty, and I was always the fat one in the corner. 'My family tried to set me up on blind dates, but I was too ashamed of the way I looked. 'Obviously this meant that I never met anyone. So I'd make up stories about men so no-one would know I'd never had a boyfriend.' To mask her embarrassment, 5ft 6in Hazel gorged on pizza, chocolate fudge cake and Chinese takeaways. Men used to insult Hazel's size 26 figure, calling her 'massive' and 'disgusting' - to comfort herself, 5ft 6in Hazel gorged on pizza, chocolate fudge cake and Chinese takeaways . At 49.9, her BMI was more than double the recommended range of 18.5 to 25. Bitterly ashamed of her body, Hazel barely left the house and spent all day watching television or browsing Facebook. She had given up all hope of finding love until a visit to her GP in 2008 gave her the motivation she needed to change her life. Hazel said: 'He told me that if I didn't start to lose weight, I would need a hip replacement by the time I was 30. 'I was absolutely mortified. Up until then, I'd blamed my size on my polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but I knew then that I had to stop making excuses. 'I was constantly tired and out of breath, and now my bones were struggling to cope under my weight. 'Every time I clicked onto my Facebook, I'd see pictures of my friends getting married or having fun. 'They were all out living their lives and I wanted to too.' Hazel joined Slimming World and set herself a goal to lose weight and find love. She threw out all her junk food and filled her fridge with fruit and vegetables. Fed up with being single and told by doctors her weight was effecting her health Hazel began her drastic diet, dropping 12st 7lb in total (left, before, right, today) And as each birthday approached, she convinced herself that it would be the year she found a boyfriend. Hazel said: 'It was hard work and of course I had the odd slip-up along the way, but seeing all of my friends fall in love really kept me going. 'I didn't want to get to 30 without ever having experienced true romance. I think it's every girl's dream to find that special someone to share your life with. 'I dreaded the first Slimming World meeting and was devastated when I found out how much I actually weighed. 'But I knew that if I didn't face my fears, I'd be stuck at that size forever - and I didn't want that any more. I wanted my happily-ever-after.' After six years of diet and exercise, Hazel lost an incredible 12st 7lbs - just in time for her 26th birthday. It took Hazel six years to reach her goal weight . Hazel joined the dating website Plenty of Fish and was bombarded with complimentary messages from men. Hazel said: 'I was so worried that men would send me horrible messages about my looks, as they had been so awful to me in the past. But they were really kind and told me that I had a lovely smile. 'Every time I signed into my account, I had a new message from someone asking me out on a date. I couldn't believe it. For the first time in my life, men thought I looked good enough to have on their arm.' A few months later, Hazel met her first boyfriend. She said: 'He was so lovely, and made me feel really special. 'It was a bit embarrassing telling him that I'd never had a boyfriend before, but he was very understanding. 'It's always nerve-wracking getting to know someone new, but it's even worse when you're doing it all for the first time at 26.' Sadly the couple split after nine months, but Hazel doesn't regret the experience and is holding out for her Mr Right. Now instead of hiding away, she is going on dates and gets chatted up on nights out too. Hazel said: 'Before I would swamp my body in baggy t-shirts and jumpers, but I'm not ashamed of myself anymore and I don't want to hide away. 'It's taken me six years to get where I am, and I finally have the confidence to chase life - and love - like I've always wanted to.'","Hazel's food addiction saw her binging on pizza, Chinese and cakes .

"Nico Rosberg has been fined a six-figure sum for his crash with Lewis Hamilton at last weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix. Mercedes, keen to show they have a grip of the fractious situation, called both drivers to the team’s factory in Brackley on Friday to discuss the second-lap incident that later forced Hamilton to retire from the race. The pair met in the boardroom for two hours with Toto Wolff, Mercedes motorsport’s executive director, and Paddy Lowe, the technical director. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg: I prefer to keep fall out with Lewis internal . Coming together: Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton crashed at last weekend's Belgian Grand Prix . Flashpoint: The two title rivals collided for the first time this season at round 13 of the world championship . Afterwards Mercedes issued a statement, saying: ‘During this meeting, Nico acknowledged his responsibility for the contact and apologised for this error of judgment. ‘Suitable disciplinary measures have been taken. ‘Lewis and Nico understand and accept the team’s No 1 rule: there must be no contact between the team’s cars on track. ‘It has been made clear that another such incident will not be tolerated. But Nico and Lewis are our drivers and we believe in them. They remain free to race.’ Although Mercedes’ idea of transparency did not extend to revealing the nature of the ‘disciplinary measures’, Sportsmail understands Rosberg’s fine will go to charity. Both men issued statements after the meeting. Reflecting on the incident, when the drivers collided as Rosberg attempted to overtake at the Les Combes chicane, the German offered an apology to his British team-mate.

Rosberg, who leads Hamilton by 29 points at the top of the drivers’ world championship standings, said: ‘The No 1 rule for us as team-mates is that we must not collide — but that is exactly what happened. ‘For that error of judgment, I apologise to Lewis and the team. ‘I also want to say sorry to the fans who were deprived of our battle in Belgium. ‘Lewis and I have been given clear instructions about how we race each other. ‘As drivers, we have a clear responsibility to the team, the fans of the sport, our partners and Mercedes-Benz to deliver clean racing. ‘We take that responsibility very seriously. I look forward to concluding the season with hard, fair competition on and off track right up to the final lap of the season in Abu Dhabi.’ Sorry: Hamilton said he and Nico had 'both made mistakes' in his statement issued on Friday afternoon . Hamilton, who had revealed details of an internal team meeting held soon after the race, escaped without punishment for that particular indiscretion but he admitted: ‘Nico and I accept that we have both made mistakes and I feel it would be wrong to point fingers and say which one is worse than the other. ‘What’s important is how we rise as a team from these situations. ‘We win and we lose together and, as a team, we will emerge stronger. ‘There is a deep foundation that still exists for me and Nico to work from, in spite of our difficult times and differences. ‘It’s going to be a tough road from here but championships have been won from much further back than I am now.’ Podium finish: Rosberg finished second at the Belgian GP to extend his lead in the championship to 29 points .","Mercedes have taken 'suitable disciplinary measures' against Rosberg .

"On the day Liverpool signed Mario Balotelli they were playing at Manchester City. Brendan Rodgers was asked about Balotelli’s reputation for attracting trouble at his former Premier League club. Despite his sky blue surroundings he did not hold back. ‘I spent three-and-a-half hours just talking him through Liverpool,’ he said. ‘It’s a massive club and it’s a different club. It’s a family club with strong family values and ethics over many years. Behaviour is very important here.’ At City, it is fair to say there was a sharp intake of breath. Rodgers may not have intended a slight but it was certainly taken that way. City executives felt he had implied that Liverpool possessed morals that were not present elsewhere. Balotelli would be safer with them than he was at Manchester City. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers responds to recent Mario Balotelli controversy . Mario Balotelli posted the image (left) on Instagram on Monday and (right) out in Manchester on Sunday night . Brendan Rodgers is beginning to realise how much of a handful Balotelli can be, even when he doesn't mean it . If taking out likes of Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure in penalty area becomes smart option, football will be guilty of foul play . Slowly, Rodgers has discovered the truth. It was not that City did not care about Balotelli’s behaviour. There was no issue around ethics, or values. The problem was the player, not the club. Rodgers could talk Balotelli through the Liverpool way for three-and-a-half months, let alone three-and-a-half weeks, and it would make no difference. If Mario wants to let off a firework, he lets off a firework. If Mario wants to throw darts, he throws darts. And if Mario wants to post a message against racism, he inadvertently insults the Jews. That’s just Mario. And that wasn’t Rodgers’ only miscalculation that evening. ‘He’s a very bright boy, he’s very clever,’ he said of Balotelli. Really? Is he? He posted the phrase ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew’ as a message of inclusivity. He might not be the intellectual titan of Rodgers’ imagination. Balotelli has struggled on the pitch for Liverpool and is becoming more of a problem off it, too . The Liverpool striker was criticised for swapping his shirt with Pepe during half-time of the loss to Real Madrid . VIDEO Balotelli apologies for racist tweet . Indeed, the only reason Balotelli’s post does not appear to have attracted the same widespread disgust as Nicolas Anelka’s anti-Semitic quenelle gesture is because he is presumed to be almost childlike in his perspectives. Whereas Anelka’s message was insidious and knowing, Balotelli gormlessly failed to spot an ideological timebomb in what he thought was a positive statement. His post was brightly coloured and the cartoon man shared his name. On realising his mistake he deleted and apologised. Still, the damage is done, the Football Association machine is in motion and Liverpool will have to deal with the fall-out, whether Balotelli gets a ban, or merely a fine and another round of negative publicity. His problems are their problems now. Balotelli invites trouble and, through him, so do Liverpool. Rodgers cannot say he wasn’t warned. Balotelli is sent off against Arsenal, one of four red cards he received when he was a Manchester City player, and the Italian striker walks around Auschwitz with the Italy team in 2012 . The striker holds up a fire safety poster after fireworks were famously set off in his bathroom .","Brendan Rodgers thought Mario Balotelli would behave better at Liverpool .

She was divorced in 1995 and lives with her sons Scott, 24, and Callan, 23, who are part of the world-famous free running group 3Run. She’s been off work with gallstones and labyrinthitis and says she also wants to cheer up her family with the fake wedding because her grandmother Irene Armer, 87, has pancreatic cancer. She’s already received several 'applications' and plans to draw up a short-list of potential grooms for the fake wedding in April. She’s booked Brighton Hill Community Centre in Basingstoke for the bash and has sent out the invitations. Her mum Sheila, 64, is backing her, saying 'I thought ""That’s Sam"". I got into the swing of it and thought ""Why not?"".'

"Iran's supreme leader has said that his country's struggle will only end when it defeats U.S.-led oppression. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told members of parliament in Tehran that Iran must be armed and 'have the capability to defend itself' in a 'world full of thieves'. His comments came as negotiations with the international community over Iran's nuclear programme ran into a stalemate, with Tehran saying world powers were 'demanding too much'. 'Battle and jihad are endless': Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, pictured in 2009. He yesterday told MPs in Tehran that 'battle will only end when society can get rid of the oppressors' front with America at the head' 'Battle and jihad are endless because evil and its front continue to exist,' Khamenei told MPs, according to a translation by U.S. news site The Daily Caller. 'This battle will only end when the society can get rid of the oppressors’ front with America at the head of it, which has expanded its claws on human mind, body and thought. 'This requires a difficult and lengthy struggle and need for great strides.' The Daily Caller's translation of a Fars News Agency report is by a reporter pseudonymously bylined Reza Khalili, who claims to be a former CIA agent in Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Khamenei's address to Parliament on Sunday continued with veiled references to the actions of the West and Arab states as he justified Iran's continued defiance of international sanctions against its nuclear programme. 'Logic and reason command that for Iran, in order to pass through a region full of pirates, needs to arm itself and must have the capability to defend itself,' he said. 'They should stop demanding too much': Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who says the impasse in nuclear talks is not his fault . 'Today’s world is full of thieves and plunderers of human honour, dignity and morality who are equipped with knowledge, wealth and power, and under the pretense of humanity easily commit crimes and betray human ideals and start wars in different parts of the world.' There has been little progress in the latest round of nuclear talks between Tehran and the U.S., Russia, France, Britain, China - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - and Germany. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking in Tehran today before a visit to Turkey for talks with European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, laid the blame for the impasse at the feet of the six powers. 'They should stop demanding too much. We have our red line, and they too want assurances that our nuclear programme will always remain peaceful. We believe these two add up,' he was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA. 'I feel the realism awakened from the last round of talks will bring us closer to conclusion. We may be able to remove one of two of the previous hurdles, or rather face new ones. In any case, we should make an effort to pass through this phase.' Iran considers the right to enrich uranium for nuclear energy a red line but that levels of enrichment are negotiable. Enriched uranium provides fuel for nuclear generating stations but it is also, if refined to a high level, the key ingredient for atomic bombs. Western powers claim Iran's declared civilian nuclear energy programme is a facade for seeking a weapons capability. Iran denies this but it has a history of hiding activity from U.N. nuclear inspectors. The powers want Iran to agree to scale back enrichment and other nuclear activity and accept tougher U.N. inspections to prove it can't quickly build atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to economic sanctions. But Mr Zarif said world powers should refrain from additional pressure on the Islamic Republic to force it into concessions. 'Sanctions haven't served them any purpose, only led to our making 19,000 centrifuges,' he said, according to IRNA, referring to the machines that enrich uranium.","Ali Khamenei says Iran must arm to defend itself in 'world full of thieves'

"On Sunday night, one of BBC Sport’s most famous faces completes more than 20 years of football punditry delivered with its own special brand of ‘touch and technique’. Alan Hansen fittingly hangs up his broadcast boots at the end of the biggest game in world football, in a country that simply oozes its love for the sport. A little while ago he decided it would be both the perfect match, and the perfect moment, to head into retirement with his latest BBC contract having fully run its course. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Alan Hansen say you can't win anything with kids . Match of the Day master: Alan Hansen will hang up his mic this Sunday after 22 years of loyal service as a Match of the Day pundit. His final appearance in the studio will come during the BBC's coverage of the World Cup final between Germany and Argentina at the Maracana . Stalwarts: Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer (right) have become familiar faces on the BBC's iconic Saturday night highlights show . Final line-up: Hansen has announced the current World Cup in Brazil as his last for the BBC. He is pictured here in a pre-tournament picture with (from left) Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry and Gabby Logan . He was a class act as a footballer; an elegant defender who helped provide the central spine of several great Liverpool teams. Hansen retired shortly after his close friend Kenny Dalglish dramatically left Anfield in 1991. A short break followed before ‘Big Al’ had to decide which direction the rest of his life would take him, prompted no doubt by his lovely wife Janet. Some early work with a fledgling Sky Sports and BBC Radio 5 Live opened up broadcasting as a possible future career path. He had already decided football management wasn’t for him. I had known Alan for several years and was looking to put a new on-screen team together for the return of that regular Saturday night institution Match of the Day. The much-loved programme was about to feature English football’s new big thing, the Premier League. Alan was the perfect fit. He had a personal trophy cabinet full to bursting, was articulate and knowledgeable about his sport, and he was a handsome so-and-so. Born winner: Hansen, the Liverpool captain, holds the FA Cup aloft after beating Everton in the 1986 final at Wembley . Sheer delight: Hansen punches the air as Liverpool beat Chelsea 1-0 at Stamford Bridge to secure the First Division title in May 1986 . Never out of his depth: Hansen after his first European Cup triumph with Liverpool in 1978 . Early days: Hansen alongside presenter Des Lynam and fellow pundit Sir Trevor Brooking (as well as some eye-catching ties) during his first years on the show . Alan joined the hugely-respected Desmond Lynam and the wonderfully controversial Jimmy Hill. When the new series of Match of the Day got under way, Alan was on board but learning a new craft. As editor of the programme I tried to assist him in his early shows. I said: ‘Alan, I’ve watched a thousand matches and you’ve played a thousand matches, let’s watch the same match being relayed into BBC TV Centre on Saturday afternoon and your target should be to spot something I don’t and make that the subject of your analysis later on Match of the Day.’ Not rocket science but hopefully a piece of sensible advice and one Alan ran with. He was flying solo within weeks. Sitting in the studio gallery, I’d watch him getting a little nervous as the famous titles were running but soon, guided by Des, he was into his analysis and that familiar unmistakable delivery of ‘pace and power’ was off and running. Paris Match of the Day: David Ginola, Jimmy Hill, Hansen and Des Lynam at World Cup '98 in France (left) and with David Beckham a year later (right) for his BBC documentary 'The Football Millionaires' In the swing: Hansen is a golf fanatic - here he tees off at Berkshire's world famous Sunningdale club in 2001 . Fore: Hansen and Kenny Dalglish play at Royal Birkdale in Liverpool in 1991 . Born: Sauchie, near Stirling.Position: Centre back (and sidekick to Gary Lineker on the Match of the Day sofa). CLUB CAREER Played for Partick and Liverpool, who paid £100,000 for him on Jock Stein’s advice.Liverpool: 620 games, 14 goals. CLUB HONOURSLeague title: 8 (1979, 80, 82, 83, 84, 86, 88, 90).European Cup: 3 (1978, 81, 84)FA Cup: 2 (1986, 89).League Cup: 4 (1981, 82, 83, 84). INTERNATIONAL CAREERScotland: 26 caps, 0 goals.

Front men: Hansen and Lineker pose in the Match of the Day studio in 2002 ahead of another season of expert analysis . We quickly put the lock on the swivel chair he sat in and Janet joined us in persuading him not to slouch. The rest came naturally. He didn’t say things just for effect and was very much his own man. He was in it for the long term. Saturday afternoons over the next few seasons became a favourite part of the week as Des, Alan, Jimmy and Gary Lineker would enjoy banter, have a go in the sweep, over-indulge on wine gums and take their turn on the tea run, all the while watching that day’s Premier League action. Helped by long-time colleague Niall Sloane, Alan established himself as a powerful advocate for good defending. Teamed up with Mark Lawrenson again, he was an intelligent reader of the game and a perceptive judge of player and team — and all without a technical gizmo in sight. He even survived, with a smile, the memorable ‘You can’t win anything with kids’ remark that set  Liverpool’s arch-rivals, Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United, on course for the double! Whoops! Hansen's bold prediction that Manchester United wouldn't win anything with kids during the 1995-1996 season backfired spectacularly as Alex Ferguson's team claimed a Double of Premier League title and FA Cup . Top of the world: The BBC's team at the 1998 World Cup in France - (back row, left to right) Jimmy Hill, Barry Davies and John Motson; (bottom row, left to right) Hansen, Des Lynam, Gary Lineker . Alan Hansen: Player and Pundit, BBC One, Friday 11 July 10.35pm . Having started his playing career at Partick Thistle, Alan spent 14 years at Liverpool, a loyal servant to the club. In broadcasting he has done the same, spending over two decades with the BBC, sticking with them when occasionally contracts and people went elsewhere. When Des moved to ITV, Alan built up a strong rapport with new presenter Lineker that endures to this day — 22 years of loyal service with the Corporation, with just a brief ‘loan spell’ to ITV when he was spotted pushing a supermarket trolley around the aisles during the odd commercial break! As well as his television work, Alan has been a consistent source of comfort and compassion for those people affected by the Hillsborough disaster. Special night: Hansen with his wife Janet at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards in Leeds last December . Cool customers: Hansen and Lineker don shades to promote the BBC's coverage of England's World Cup qualifiers in 2001 . Scrub up for the Cup: Hansen and Lineker strip off to publicise the BBC's coverage of the FA Cup in 1997 . He was in the Liverpool team that desperate afternoon in April 1989 and has been at the side of the  distressed families from that moment since. His concern is as genuine as it is long-standing. Alan will slip into retirement from the media spotlight comfortably. He’s left on his own terms with plenty of good memories behind him. He has a loving family around him, is never short of a golf match with Kenny and will sit down on a Saturday night and wait for that famous piece of music that heralds the start of a programme he has helped make his own.","Hansen will hang up his Match of the Day mic after this Sunday's World Cup final .

King's presence marks a new period in the Democrat's romantic life as he has apparently ended things with his former mistress Rielle Hunter once and for all. He reportedly first arranged for Hunter and their daughter Quinn - whose conception and birth during the 2008 presidential race thwarted his hopes of being his party's nominee - to live in a separate house near his family's home in Chapel Hill. Then the year after Elizabeth died, The Enquirer reports that he allowed Hunter and Quinn to move into his family's home alongside Emma, Claire and Jack. For a period, the relationship between Hunter and Edwards seemed to be back on track as they spent weekends at his beach house in the resort locale of Figure Eight Island. Now it seems she has been replaced as Ms King is now the one accompanying Edwards and his children on trips to his beach house. Hunter reportedly had a falling out with Edwards after she made the decision to publish a book about the affair. He allegedly kicked her out of the home and she has since done an about-face, writing a mea culpa for The Huffington Post. 'Instead of apologizing when I should have, I went on to hurt more people by writing a book,' Hunter wrote months after its publication. 'I truly did not realize at that time how damaged I was and because of that, when I wrote my book I made more mistakes, ones I feel horrible about.'","Disgraced former Senator has reportedly been dating Danielle King for about a year .

"Eccentric fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, pictured, said women were badly dressed due to 'too much choice and too little taste' She has made her fortune designing fashion collections that encourage women to change their outfits with each season. However Dame Vivienne Westwood now claims the fairer sex struggle to dress themselves because they have ‘too much choice and not enough taste’. Giving an interview, the eccentric designer, 73, said men dress better than their girlfriends or wives because their dress code is more straightforward, meaning they have less in their wardrobes to choose from. And the punk designer, who was instrumental in the rebellious movement, which sought to challenge the status quo, also appeared to turn her back on the crusade. Far from it being anarchic rebellion, she described it merely as a ‘marketing opportunity’ that served to generate publicity for her. Speaking to BBC Radio 3 programme Private Passions, in which celebrities reveal how music has influenced their lives, Dame Vivienne said: ‘Do I dare say that generally speaking men, because of this code, usually dress better than their wives, who have too much choice and not enough taste probably.’ It is not the first time the designer, whose style earned her the nickname the Queen of Punk, has criticised women’s ability to choose their clothes. Last year the designer, whose fashion range features dresses which cost almost £1,000, said women were guilty of buying clothes ‘for the sake of it’ and without thought. And she urged them to invest in quality over quantity. Dame Vivienne, who caused controversy when she collected her OBE with no knickers on, then exposed herself to photographers outside, was instrumental in the punk movement of the 1970s. She and her former lover Malcolm McLaren, who managed the outrageously dressed punk rock group Sex Pistols, launched the Chelsea boutique SEX. The shop was full of naked headless mannequins, and ‘punk style’ clothing featuring whips and chains. It was symbolic of the movement, which sought to challenge the status quo. However, speaking to composer and broadcaster Michael Berkeley, Dame Vivienne said it was simply a ‘marketing opportunity’. Dame Vivienne, right, said she launched her punk boutique SEX, pictured, as a 'marketing opportunity' She said: ‘I don’t think I’ve done at all what you say [challenging the status quo]. Regarding punk I just think that all that happened was it provided the marketing opportunity and the marketing opportunity supported the establishment because, you know, “aren’t we great rebels, you know, we’ve got freedom of speech and trust us” it was terrible.’ The interview will be broadcast on Sunday December 21 at 12pm and is part of BBC’s classical music line-up for Christmas, which also includes a week of live concerts from the Temple Winter Festival on Radio 3. Dame Vivienne is married to her second husband, Andreas Kronthaler, who is 25 years her junior. She has two sons: Joseph, who co-founded Agent Provocateur, from her love affair with McClaren, and Ben, from her first marriage to Derek Westwood. Dame Vivienne continues to design clothing lines, which are sold on Net-A-Porter and her website, as well as in high-end department store Selfridge’s. The vegetarian also campaigns for environmental issues and earlier this year appeared in a video campaign for the charity PETA, urging people to use less water in the shower. Last month she delivered a petition to Downing Street outlining concerns about genetically modified crops. And she said people should ‘eat less’ if they cannot afford to shop organically.","Dame Vivienne Westwood said women struggled to dress themselves .

"An octopus floored a wasp. A wolf kicked off a melee. The MailOnline Mascot Derby never fails to deliver, and Friday night was no different. The real serious entertainment was left to the mavericks at the Kia Oval as south London romped home to clinch victory. But that's only half the story. Having a ball: The mascots pose for a photo ahead of the MailOnline Mascot Derby at the Kia Oval . Raucous: There was mayhem as the mascots piled on top of each other with Billy the Badger looking on . Down and out: The octopus lies on the field as some of the other mascots pose for the cameras . The 17 representatives were split into two teams - north and south of the capital - and ended up crashing into each other as the obstacle course was left in tatters. With the competition descending into farce - there didn't appear any clear leader - Saracens' wolf seized his moment. Off he went, making a beeline for West Ham United's Hammerhead, and putting his rival down on the floor. Carnage ensued. Leyton Orient's wyvern waded in, with 'Theo' igniting a pile-on that had supporters in stitches. And it's a good job.

The 15,000-strong crowd were treated to what was a drama-filled relay race involving excitable football, cricket and rugby union mascots. There was definite nervous tension in the air beforehand; some chose to down as much water as possible. Others - Fulham's badger - decided his replenishment just had to be alcoholic. The beers flowed during the Middlesex innings and there was no stopping Billy. Away he danced, enthusiastically cajoling the crowd before the play fight broke out. Big race: London Wasps' Sting and Saracen's wolf hold up the MailOnline Sport finish tape . Piles of fun: Bubbles the West Ham bear gets up to mischief as he jumps on the Saracens wolf . Bodies lay strewn on the pitch, some pride had been battered. Chelsea's pair Stamford and Bridget watched on while QPR, Crystal Palace and a rather fiery Tottenham cock all threw themselves into the hilariously mismanaged bundle that spiralled out of control. Surrey's lion wasn't interested in all that though. Maybe oblivious to what was going on, maybe just that competitive, he strode to the finish line and won it for south London. But what about the wolf? He wandered off triumphantly with two arms raised. Saracens have a good one there.

"Bill O'Reilly has remained a controversial voice in the aftermath of a grand jury deciding not to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, but on Monday the anchor went so far he even manged to alienate a fellow Fox News contributor. Remarking on a group of St. Louis Rams players who adopted a 'hands up, don’t shoot' stance in a show of solidarity for Ferguson protesters prior to Sunday's game, O'Reilly said on The O'Reilly Factor; 'Quite frankly, I don’t think they’re smart enough to know what they’re doing.' He then added again, 'I absolutely don’t think they’re smart enough to know what they’re doing.' Scroll down for videos . Protest: Five members of the St. Louis Rams adopted a 'hands up, don't shoot' stance before taking the field on Sunday in a show of support for the protesters in Ferguson . Speaking out: Bill O'Reilly said on his show Monday that the players weren't 'smart enough to know what they were doing' and that they were propagating a lie . He went on to say the men were propagating the lie that Brown's hands were raised at the time he was shot. Not agreeing at all with this statement however was Mary Katharine Ham, a regular Fox News contributor, who seemed disgusted with what O'Reilly had to say. Ham said she thought that the players 'non-violent' protest was fine, and then later defended her comments on Twitter, saying, 'Thing is I DON’T CARE if NFL players make displays w/ which I disagree. Not being as upset as you doesn’t mean I betrayed America.' Fox News analyst Juan Williams, also a guest on Monday, disagreed with O'Reilly as well, and his take away that the football players were somehow coming out against all police. 'Look, you’ve got crazy people on all sides, Bill,' said Williams. 'But if you think that those football players identify and say, ""Oh, all cops are bad""? That is not true.' Other side: O'Reilly's guests on Monday, Fox News Contributor Mary Katharine Ham (left) and analyst Juan Williams (right) did not agree with his statements . On Sunday, St. Louis Rams players Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook, Chris Givens, Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt took to the field making the same gesture many protesters have been making across the country these past two weeks. This as crowds gathered outside the stadium during the game chanting 'Hands up, don't shoot!' It seems that even Fox News may have had a problem with O'Reilly's statement, as they took down the clip after posting it earlier in the day on Tuesday. O'Reilly has been very vocal about his disdain for Ferguson protesters, saying that even those who did not loot or set buildings on fire should still be considered criminals for continuing to protest as these events happened. Meanwhile, the St. Louis Police Officers Association has called on both the NFL and the Rams to discipline the five players. They called the moved 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory.' The NFL and the Rams said Monday that the players would not be punished. Unrest: A protester is dragged away outside the St. Louis Rams home game on Sunday . Cook spoke about the gesture following the game, saying; 'There has to be a change that starts with the people that are most influential around the world.' He then added, 'No matter what happened on that day, no matter how the whole situation went down, there has to be a change.' St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar has claimed that Rams' chief operating officer called him to apologize about the incident, something he vehemently denies. 'We did not apologize,' Rams spokesman Artis Twyman told CNN. The Officers Association then responded to that claim by posting on their Facebook page; 'Even though Mr. Demoff stated he never apologized, the Chief believed it to be an apology and the Chief sent the email to police staff to let them know about the call, after he told Mr. Demoff he would share his sentiments with his staff.'","Bill O'Reilly commented on five St Louis Rams players who adopted a 'hands up, don't shoot' pose before game Sunday .

"A callous couple stole a poppy collection tin from a supermarket by using a pair of bolt cutters to break the chain tying it to a shop till. The man, aged about 45, and the woman, in her late 30s, waited for staff at a Tesco Express store in Bournemouth, Dorset, to turn their backs before they struck. The woman pretended to shop at the self-checkout kiosk while her partner walked up to an empty till. Police today released this CCTV image of a woman they want to question in relation to the theft of a poppy collection tin in Tesco Express in Bournemouth . He then lifted the chain securing the British Legion Poppy Appeal tin and cut it before calmly walking outside. Police today released this CCTV image of a woman they want to question in relation to the incident. It is thought the collection tin had £200 in donations inside it. The shocking theft, which took place on Monday, was caught on CCTV inside the store in the Winton area of Bournemouth, Dorset. Aadeel Din, store manager, said: 'I think they picked this tin because it would generally hold one pound coins and it was full. 'The staff were seeing in a delivery at the time so there wasn't anyone on the tills. 'The woman pretended to go shopping, as a distraction and the man walked up to the till. Supermarket manager Aadeel Din holds a replacement Poppy Appeal tin outside a Tesco Express where a man and a woman stole £200 of donations on Monday . 'He looked around before pulling the chain that connected the collection tin to the till and then took out a pair of pliers, cut the chain and put the tin under his coat. 'The woman then dumped the things she had picked up and they both looked around to see if anyone had noticed before they left. 'I've worked in retail for 20 years and never seen someone do this. It is cold and calculated.' A police spokesman said officers are investigating the theft. No arrests have been made. Inspector Dave Cuff of Norfolk Police added: 'Stealing from a charity is a heartless act, particularly in this case as we approach Remembrance Sunday. 'People donate to charities in the belief the money will be put to good use and such crimes are totally unacceptable.

"Suspected Islamist Boko Haram fighters have abducted dozens of boys and men from a village in northeast Nigeria, according to witnesses. After loading them onto trucks and driving them off more 97 people are now missing. The kidnappings come four months after Boko Haram, which is fighting to reinstate a medieval Islamic caliphate in religiously mixed Nigeria, abducted more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok. They are still missing. Several witnesses who fled after Sunday's raid on Doron Baga, a sandy fishing village near the shores of Lake Chad, said militants clothed in military and police uniforms had burned several houses. 'They left no men or boys in the place; only young children, girls and women,' said Halima Adamu, sobbing softly and looking exhausted after a 180 km (110 mile) road trip on the back of a truck to Maiduguri, capital of the northeastern state of Borno. Suspected Islamist Boko Haram fighters have abducted dozens of boys and men from a village in northeast Nigeria, according to witnesses. The kidnappings come four months after Boko Haram abducted more than 200 schoolgirls (pictured) fom the village of Chibok . 'They were shouting 'Allah Akbar' (God is greatest), shooting sporadically. There was confusion everywhere. 'They started parking our men and boys into their vehicles, threatening to shoot whoever disobey them. Everybody was scared.' They said six older men were also killed in Sunday's raid, while another five people were wounded. Boko Haram, seen as the number one security threat to Africa's top economy and oil producer, has dramatically increased attacks on civilians in the past year, and the once-grassroots movement has rapidly lost popular support as it gets more bloodthirsty. Its solution - kidnapping boys and forcing them to fight and abducting girls as sex slaves - is a chilling echo of Ugandan rebel Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army, which has operated in the same way in Uganda, South Sudan and central Africa for decades. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in a video he sent taunting the Nigerian government over the kidnapping of the girls from their boarding school dormitory in April . The military did not respond to a request for comment. A security source said they were aware of the incident but were still investigating the details. The kidnappers overpowered local vigilantes who had no support because this is no military presence there, the villagers said. Talatu Abubakar, another villager who fled to Maiduguri, said the invaders had taunted the men for being unable to defend themselves. 'They were shouting 'Where is your pride? You people used to be warriors. Today you are all just women, not as brave as we thought',' he said. He said that from his Hadeija clan alone, some 47 people were missing and feared to have been abducted. The raid shows how mobile Boko Haram units can be. After a military offensive in May last year broke their hold on the area around Lake Chad in the far northeast of Borno state, the rebels relocated to the south of the state, near the Cameroon border nearly 300 km (190 miles) away. Chibok, where the girls were taken from, is in this area. Their re-appearance in the area demonstrates their ability to move across vast swathes of northeastern Nigeria without being intercepted by the military. Nigerian forces are overstretched against a determined foe. In the past week they have fought gun battles with Boko Haram Islamists in two key towns in the south of Borno - Gwoza, the security sources said, and the garrison town of Damboa, which the militants sacked a month ago.","Militants  burned several houses and witnesses said 97 people are missing .

"New York City's West Indian Day Parade has been marred by violence before it even started after a fatal shooting - but it didn't stop some 2million people from turning out to watch the wild and colorful celebration today. Several people were shot Sunday night and Monday morning near the route of the famed Caribbean celebration in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The New York Police Department said a 55-year-old man was shot and killed about 3.30am today. Officers have arrested a suspect. Several other shootings were reported in the area, as well. The celebration's history of violence in recent years led to a major police crackdown - with more than 4,000 NYPD officers on hand to keep tabs on gang activity and keep order. Colorful floats, elaborate costumes, politicians and merrymakers filled the streets this afternoon ins spite of the violence and police promises to enforce 'quality of life' violations. Scroll down for video . Revelry: Hundreds of people dressed up in colorful costumes and turned out Monday for the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, New York . Incredible costumes mark the West Indian Day Parade - though this peacock gar, which required wheels to maneuver through the streets, may take the cake . Victorious: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (right) , whose wife Charlane McCray (second from right) is Caribbean, returned to the parade after appearing last year as a candidate. He and his children Dante (left) and Chiara (second from left) demonstrated their 'smackdown' dance again . Hundreds of revelers in colorful costumes are taking part in the West Indian Day Parade on Monday. Before the parade even kicked off, several people were shot and one was killed near the parade route . 'I love the culture, the dancing, the food and the fun,' said Giovanni Oriol, 35, a Brooklyn resident of Haitian descent. 'My culture is very important to me, and this is a celebration of all that is good about all of these people and places.' Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the importance of the parade despite the violence that has all-too-frequently surrounded it. ""The vast, vast majority have a wonderful time and only a few individuals get out of line,"" he said after a breakfast attended by elected officials, parade organizers and local dignitaries before the parade. ""This parade started small, became big and is one of the great events in our city,"" he said. Sporting a colorful tribal shirt, the mayor was joined on the hot, humid day by his wife, Chirlane McCray, who is of Caribbean decent, and their children, Dante and Chiara. They received cheers throughout the march and frequently shook hands with revelers. Crackdown: Police vowed to be out in force. Some 4,000 officers were tapped to enforce order at the parade . Dignitaries: The West Indian Day Parade is a political mainstay - coming just one day before primaries. Gov Andrew Cuomo (right) was in full campaign mode. Mayor de Blasio was making a victory lap . Crackdown: The NYPD warned its officers would be out in force to enforce 'quality of life' violations in an effort to quell violences . This was de Blasio's first time marching as mayor; a year ago, the raucous reception he received at the parade foreshadowed his blowout win in the Democratic primary. He and his family marked the occasion last year by debuting a family dance they dubbed ""The Smackdown,"" which calls for them to pantomime licking their hands, swirling them over the heads, slapping their palms to the concrete and then jumping backward. The burdens of office didn't stop the family from delivering an encore performance Monday, drawing cheers from the sweaty crowd and a gasp from the parade's master of ceremonies. Dressed for the occasion: Adjee Hamilton, center, dances as she and others wait to take part in the West Indian Day Parade .

At least 11 nations were represented in the parade . Preening: Two parade dancers make final touches on their costumes before stepping off . Dare to bare: Female dancers traditionally wear less for the parade . Governor Andrew Cuomo also received a warm welcome a week from his bid to reclaim the Democratic nomination. Cuomo's long-shot opponent, Zephyr Teachout, was also in attendance. She spent much of the parade granting interview requests when she wasn't dancing and waving at flag-toting partiers. The parade celebrates Caribbean culture and echoes traditional pre-Lenten Carnival festivities, with dancers wearing elaborate costumes, some of which are feathered . The NYPD's 77th Precinct circulated a flyer warning it would be cracking down on public drinking, sidewalk grilling, loud music and other 'quality of life' violations in an effort to quell violence and maintain order. 'Residents and store owners are advised to cooperate fully. Those who do not comply will be summonsed or possibly arrested,'  the flyer warned. 'Undercover officers, members of the Consumer Affairs Dept and other Enforcement Agencies will be doing random inspections without notice. Loud speakers will be confiscated and owners summonsed.' Some Crown Heights neighbors complained the NYPD is trying to stop residents from enjoying themselves in the hopes that the parade eventually ends entirely.

"The FA will hold talks with England team sponsors Vauxhall to revamp the fans’ man of the match award derailed by online voters for both the San Marino and Estonia games. England supporters made a mockery of Vauxhall’s fans engagement initiative by making goalkeeper Joe Hart MotM on each occasion despite him rarely touching the ball in either Euro 2016 qualifier. Joe Hart was voted man of the match in both of England's games against San Marino and Estonia . Fans voted for Hart as their man of the match not once but twice and England could change the system . The FA/Vauxhall view is that a one-off cheeky protest about the San Marino mismatch where 63 per cent of the vote went to Hart was fair enough but not when it was repeated in Tallinn when an 82 per cent majority picked the Manchester City player. Vauxhall are keen to keep the fans centrally involved in the vote, but need to work on a safety procedure that guards against ridiculous choices being made in future. TV rights holders ITV choose the official Vauxhall man of the match award at Wembley and co-commentator Andy Townsend went for Jack Wilshere after the stroll against San Marino.

Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal’s wealthy chief executive who earned £2.19million in the last financial year, will face embarrassing questions at the club’s annual meeting on Thursday as to why sub-contracted workers at the Emirates Stadium are paid less than the minimum London living wage of £8.80 per hour. Arsenal say none of their direct employees have wages of less than that figure. But there are lower paid cleaners and catering staff who work for Arsenal-contracted companies who are responsible for their hourly wage. But the question submitted to the board says Arsenal’s strong financial resources and long tradition for doing things the right way should mean all personnel working at the club should be paid the London living wage. Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis will face some tricky questions at the club's annual meeting . The mystery continues of just who leaked to Cricinfo that first doctored draft of a document being prepared for the England and Wales Cricket Board by former FA lawyer Richard Bush of Onside Law to potentially counter Kevin Pietersen’s book claims. Cricinfo hired solicitors DLA Piper to state it wasn’t the ECB or Onside Law that gave them it, but will not reveal the source. Long-term Lancaster? Neither the RFU nor Stuart Lancaster’s legal advisors involved in negotiating the terms will divulge whether there is a break clause in the astonishing six-year contracts awarded to him and his coaches. But surely — like in other long-term deals for national team bosses — there are ‘liquidating damages’ clauses inserted allowing both sides to extricate themselves. .............................................................................

"Search vessels are preparing to enter a new phase in the hunt for missing Malaysian airlines flight MH370. High-tech equipment including sonar and video cameras are set to arrive at a site in the Indian ocean, more than 1,500 kilometres off the Western Australian coast, within days. Experts believe the plane crashed somewhere in the area after veering off course from it's Kuala Lumpur to Beijing flight on 8 March, with 239 people on board. A massive land and sea search has failed to find any trace of the plane. GO Phoenix, the first of the vessels contracted to conduct the underwater search, departed Jakarta, Indonesia more than a week ago, after work was done to prepare the ship for the sea and weather conditions it would encounter. Scroll down for video . Fugro Discovery (pictured), which along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix, will soon start a new  high-resolution search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . A three-dimensional model of the sea floor terrain, derived from satellite gravity measurements and some from ocean passage soundings. A bathymetric survey currently underway is focussed on gathering more detailed and higher resolution data in preparation for the underwater search phase . Chief commissioner from the ATSB Martin Dolan says the vessel is likely to arrive late Sunday. 'When they get going, they will deploy an underwater sonar in on the end of very long cable, eight kilometres, they will tow that sonar in on a toefish, which contains sonar equipoment, close to ocean floor, 100 metres,' he said. 'They send out sonar signals, get them back, a width of about 1.5 kms, that will go up the cable to vessel and crews to look and anaylise for anything for interest.' 'It will be recorded and transferred in batches, re-anaylised so nothing to be missed.' The new stage of the search comes after months of detailed analysis and sea bed surveys, which has indicated the aircraft should be found along a defined arc in the southern Indian Ocean, where it's believed to have run out of fuel. The primary search area - dubbed the 'priority area' - is an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, roughly the size of Croatia, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. 'Three things that make it complicated is that we know aircraft will be found there but have to prioritise high probability areas,' said Chief Dolan. 'Also towing expensive equipment, we need to know closely what the ocean floor is like, the sea floor is quite complex, not just a simple matter, additional attention is needed for some areas to cover them properly.' 'Lastly data itself requires a specialised eye to understand, so we also have the capacity to review.' The chief also mentioned the weather conditions, which can be quite challenging because it is so unpredictable. Images from the bathymetric survey being conducted in the latest MH370 search area: They provide information  including the contours, depths and hardness of the ocean floor to ensure the safe and effective operation of equipment in the search . These images show remnants of volcanoes, towering ridges and deep trenches that have been discovered on the seabed of the search area named Broken Ridge, an extensive linear, mountainous sea floor structure . 'Weather is improving and the course of this month is as good as it gets, make the searching as easy as possible but still big swells, storm will come through.' Vessels will also be joining GO Phoenix including Furgo Discovery which has completed fit out works in Durban, South Africa and is en-route to Australia where it is expected to arrive in Fremantle on Sunday. Furgo Equator, the vessel currently being used to survey the search area, is expected to be mobilised as a search vessel when its bathymetric work is complete around the end of October. 'The second vessel, Furgo will be there about the end of the third week of this month, the Equator in Perth by the end of the month to do its first underwater search. This bathymetric survey image shows that the depth of the sea floor in one area of the search site is -5300 metres below sea level (purple) and then rises steeply to -2500 metres below sea level (red) Very few marine surveys have taken place in the MH370 search area. Previous mapping did not show the shape of the sea floor and only indicated ocean depth . 'It's not clear how long that search will take,' Transport Minister Warren Truss said, according to the ABC. `We would hope, obviously, to find the aircraft on the first day, but it could in fact take a year to search the entire area and weather conditions will have an impact.' The chief commissioner said there are several 'high probability' areas located that will be searched in the southern arc of the Indian Ocean. 'The second vessel will go to another high probability area and the third vessel will work between those two areas,' he said. The area being searched for MH370 has been narrowed down to a 60,000 square kilometre arc (grey) in the southern Indian Ocean, 1800km off the Australian coast . The yellow markings represent the area surveyed via bathymetric surveys . 'Until we have more solid data in flight data by boxes no one will  be able to come to form a view, people will speculate.'

"It is almost 75 years since they enjoyed their finest hour in the Battle of Britain. And now, an Oxfordshire flying club has marked the momentous occasion by creating a classic Spitfire, albeit in a slightly smaller form than the World War Two version. Led by flying instructor Paul Fowler, the club hope to build a new squadron of Spitfires in time to mark the 75th anniversary of the campaign which helped Britain defeat Hitler's Luftwaffe. The first Spitfire - a Supermarine Mk 26B, a 90 per cent scale replica based on the original Supermarine Spitfire design has been created by Enstone Flying Club . The plane cost £210,000 to produce, funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £17,000 or £11,000 and was built by a team of volunteers . Paul Fowler (pictured), the manager of the project, told MailOnline: 'What's been produced is beyond my wildest expectations. She's absolutely beautiful' Mr Fowler, 53, has a mission and dream to build 11 more Spitfires to fly a squadron down The Mall in formation at 11am on September 15, 2015. This will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in World War Two . The first Spitfire - a Supermarine Mk 26B, a 90 per cent scale replica based on the original Supermarine Spitfire design - is now ten days away from its maiden flight. Twenty volunteers - ranging from a BT engineer to a BA pilot - helped construct the first Spitfire, but more helpers are needed to build the other 11. Paul Fowler, the manager of the project, told MailOnline: 'What's been produced is beyond my wildest expectations. She's absolutely beautiful. 'What has been created is remarkable and not far short of a miracle and it has spurred me on to do more.' Mr Fowler said: 'What we are doing is completely unique and no one is doing this anywhere else in the world. It's also absolutely British' The plane weighs 810 kg and is a 90 per cent scale version of an original three-tonne Spitfire which helped Britain defeat Hitler's Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain . The planes are created by a team of volunteers and funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £17,000 or £11,000 . The British date the battle from 10 July to 31 October 1940, which represented the most intense period of daylight bombing . Mr Fowler, 53, has a mission and dream to build 11 more Spitfires to fly a squadron down The Mall in formation at 11am on September 15, 2015. This will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in World War Two. He told MailOnline: 'What we are doing is completely unique and no one is doing this anywhere else in the world. It's also absolutely British. 'I wanted to create something exciting and different to get people interested in flying and aeroplanes.' It is hoped the Spitfires, built in Enstone, will be flown by County of Oxford Squadron pilots with the World War Two veterans in the back of the aircraft. Mr Fowler will ask the RAF Red Arrows to teach the pilots who will fly the Spitfires the formation flying skills required to perform the mission. Mr Fowler said: 'In order to achieve the very ambitious goal of flying 12 Spitfires down The Mall next year we need a lot of money very quickly' One of the aims of the project was to recognise the 'massive effort' that went into creating them during World War Two . The Spitfire produced by Enstone Flying Club burns 38 litres of fuel an hour, rather than the original Spitfire which used four and half litres a minute . The planes are produced by volunteers which Mr Fowler said is the 'whole ethos' of the project. When completed, each plane will weigh 810 kg and will be a 90 per cent scale version of an original three-tonne Spitfire which helped Britain defeat Hitler's Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. Mr Fowler added: 'It's slightly smaller and it also burns 38 litres of fuel an hour, rather than four and half litres a minute. It costs about £110 an hour to run, whereas the World War Two planes cost between £2,500 and £3,000 to run.' He said the plane cost £210,000 to produce, funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £17,000 or £11,000. Mr Fowler is relying on sponsors and donations to complete the squadron. He needs to raise a further £3.7million to fulfil his dream. 'In order to achieve the very ambitious goal of flying 12 Spitfires down The Mall next year we need a lot of money very quickly and we need to work quicker and ramp it up a bit.' Mr Fowler said he hoped to 'keep the Spitfire legend alive forever' and said he first became interested in planes at the age of eight . Mr Fowler said: 'I came up with the idea of the Spitfire club as a way of getting pilots to keep flying. I want to create a huge community which revolves around a shared love of aircraft' The flying club hope to hold events across the UK and in Europe to build up a picture of the heyday of the Spitfire . Seats: 1 (but training version was two-seater) Speed: 378mph . Weight: 2,309kg . Length: 9.12m . Height: 11ft 5in . Engine: Rolls-Royce Merlin . Seats: 2 . Speed: 200mph . Weight: 810kg . Length: 8.15m . Height: 7ft 1in . Engine: V6 Isuzu Trooper . Mr Fowler, who said the aim was to 'keep the Spitfire legend alive forever', first became fascinated by flight at the age of eight when he jumped off the roof of his parents' shed with a pair of cardboard wings strapped to his back. 'I wasn't very aerodynamic, but it certainly made me want to become a pilot. 'I came up with the idea of the Spitfire club as a way of getting pilots to keep flying. 'I've found over the years that many of them give up once the excitement of learning to fly evaporates. 'I have always been interested in military history but was always trying to find a way of bringing more people into aviation. It really came about by a bit of frustration and trying to find something people were really interested in and everybody loves the Spitfire.' He also wants to make aeroplanes more 'accessible' to enthusiasts. 'I want to give them some hands-on experience, because having met many through the flying club, they almost seem afraid to even touch aeroplanes. 'I want to create a huge community which revolves around a shared love of aircraft.' Mr Fowler said he hoped to stage events across Europe. He said: 'We want to hold events, where the aircraft will fly in displays and be the focal point, but we also want to build up a picture of the heyday of the Spitfire, with people dressed up in 1940s gear for example.' He said another aim of the project was to recognise the 'massive effort' that went into creating them during the war. 'I have been lucky enough to meet people who were involved in the original production. I have met some of the design team and people who worked in production at Castle Bromwich, in Birmingham. Some people worked there 12 hours a day, six days a week during the war and did the same job every single day. 'The ones I have met love the Spitfire we have created and it is great we have been able to recognise those people who helped produce it.'","Enstone Flying Club, in Oxfordshire, hope to build 12 Spitfires to mark the 75th anniversary of Battle of Britain .

"The U.S. Agency for International Development ordered 5,000 body bags from a Florida company last month as part of its planned response to an outbreak of the Ebola virus in western Africa. And as President Obama prepares to enlarge America's aid to affected countries, a company that makes protective clothing says the State Department, which oversees USAID, has invited bids for 160,000 hazmat suits. The body-bag purchase came on August 19, just after the World Health Organization said the epidemic had killed 1,000 people. That death toll is now greater than 2,400. The size of the contracts indicates how seriously governments are taking the threat, especially considering that all 5,000 body bags were destined only for Liberia – one of three countries whose citizens have been hammered with new disease cases and paralyzed with fear. And the purchase says nothing about what resources might be coming as part of other nations' contributions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Liberian Ministry of Health workers remove the body of a man who died Saturday from the Ebola virus, which has claimed at least 2,400 lives .

A Liberian woman mourns her husband, an Ebola victim, on Friday in the capital city of Monrovia . Death everywhere: Aid workers in hazmat suits routinely retrieve cadavers from parking lots, shopping centers and residential townships . Barack Obama will travel to Atlanta on Tuesday for a briefing with experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His chief spokesman said Monday that the president will announce new levels of support from the U.S. to fight the disease. The CDC has begun to warn health care workers and hospital administrators to be on the lookout for potential Ebola cases. 'Now is the time to prepare,' reads part of a six-page 'checklist' being distributed nationwide. The agency has already deployed about 100 of its own workers to Africa, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing. 'This is, if not the largest, among the largest deployments of CDC personnel – ever,' he said. America, Earnest added, 'has a unique responsibility to step up in the midst of an international crisis. ... Our doctors and scientists are some of the best in the world.' The federal government as a whole has allocated $100 million in financing and other resources to assist what has become a continent-wide race against the clock to stamp out a crafty pathogen before it can spread beyond hope of containment. That level of support, about one-sixth of what the WHO estimates is needed, 'underscores just how extraordinarily serious the administration believes this issue is,' said Earnest. Obama's visit will add a new sense of urgency, and more aid to the countries where the threat is the more dire. 'I do anticipate that we'll have some additional announcements to make' on Tuesday, Earnest said, 'about additional commitments we're making.' USAID's body-bag purchase was signed August 19, a $32,500 contract with a Florida packaging company, earmarked 'for the USAID/OFDA response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa.' OFDA is the agency's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. Buying the body bags, however, was just the first step. USAID inked another contact on August 27 'for the transport of 5,000 body bags from the vendor's facility to Liberia.' Flying them there from warehouses in Illinois and California cost another $57,144. Hazmat suits are in demand as health care workers tend to the sick and bury the dead, often removing their bodies unceremoniously in pickup trucks and panel vans . Hardest-hit areas of Africa are in the western Sahel, with Liberia being so far the epicenter of death . It's not clear whether the State Department's purchase of 160,000 hazmat suits is intended to be delivered all at once, or to which countries they will be delivered. But Lakeland Industries, based in Ronkonkoma, New York, reported on Friday that 'the U.S. State Department alone' has solicited bids 'for 160,000 suits.' 'We encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments,' the company said in a press release, 'so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health.'","Two government contracts were completed this month, sending 5,000 cadaver bags to Liberia .

The former Manchester United star surprised many by scoring a European hat-trick against Galatasaray . The 23-year-old has also scored three goals in as many games for England since leaving Old Trafford . The news will come as a relief to Arsene Wenger, who has been managing a lengthy injury list at the Emirates this season. That now appears to be subsiding after pictures of Theo Walcott training at London Colney on Monday, with Olivier Giroud also closing in on a return. Aaron Ramsey and Mesut Ozil are both still missing - as well as Mathieu Debuchy - but Wenger has reason for cheer. Roy Hodgson had played down the extent of Welbeck's knock immediately after the game. 'I don't think he's injured. He just rolled his ankle slightly. The doctors are not worried about it,' he said. The former Manchester United forward arrived at the Emirates in a £16million move on deadline day and, despite the fears of some Arsenal supporters, has impressed with four goals - including a hat-trick in the Champions League against Galatasaray.

"Jose Mourinho will prioritise winning over remaining undefeated as Chelsea go in search of trophies. The Blues are unbeaten after 20 matches in all competitions this season, leading to suggestions of a Barclays Premier League campaign without defeat. Chelsea, prevented from scoring for the first time last Saturday at Sunderland, play Tottenham on Wednesday and Mourinho knows silverware is the target, not matching Arsenal's 'Invincibles' of a decade ago. He said: 'One thing is that I don't think it's possible (to complete a season unbeaten). The other thing is that we are not playing for that. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (left) watches the action at the Stadium of Light from the sidelines . 'If (against Spurs) we have a 0-0 with 20 minutes to go, we are not going to play for the 0-0 to be undefeated after 21 matches. No way. 'If you play for that, if that is one objective, maybe you draw so many matches, you don't take risks to try and win matches. You are happy just to be undefeated. 'If you get 10 draws, you get 10 points. If you win five and lose five, you make 15 points. 'We are going to play matches to win. And, sometimes, we will lose. 'I'd prefer 15 points and lost matches than 10 points and being undefeated.' Sunderland defender Santiago Vergini (left) tussles for the ball with Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard . Chelsea have been scintillating at times, leading many to speak of the Blues as champions elect.

We had seven hours by bus to get back."" That gave the Portuguese time to reflect as he bids to secure his third Premier League title and Chelsea's first since 2010. 'We have to play, we have to win matches and must get points,' Mourinho said. 'That's what we're doing. We don't promise anything. We don't put ourselves in that position, of being arrogant to say we are going to win. We don't do that. Diego Costa gets in a tangle with Sunderland defender John O'Shea during the 0-0 draw at the Stadium of Light .

But you cannot choose to try to win this competition or that one. 'We try to improve the team, try and have the best possible team playing the best possible football, adapted to different situations, and after that let's see what is possible to win.' Some consider only Manchester City capable of catching and overhauling Chelsea, but Mourinho disagrees. 'There's a long way to go,' he added.

"A mother who was rushed to hospital with severe back ache was stunned to discover she was actually nine months' pregnant. Kelly Gadsby, from Tamworth, woke up early one morning in agony, having worked a long shift as an assistant bar manager the day before. Within 24 hours, she had become a mother for the second time after the arrival of her son Frankie. Shock: Kelly Gadsby was suffering from extreme back pain and had no idea she was pregnant. Her son Frankie was born just hours later . Ms Gadsby had been taking the pill daily and had periods as normal, but as her agony increased en-route to hospital, she claims noticed a bump appear on her stomach. Baffled doctors decided to give her a pregnancy test, which came back positive. Frankie was born just hours later, weighing 8lb 5oz. Ms Gadsby says she had no idea she was pregnant,. In fact, friends had even told her she had lost weight. Alongside working 14-hour shifts, she had fallen down the stairs at her home three months before. She said: 'It's come as just a little bit of a shock, to say the least. Ms Gadsby had been taking the pill daily and had periods as normal, but as her agony increased en-route to hospital, she claims noticed a bump appear on her stomach . 'I think the biggest surprise is that I didn't have a clue I was pregnant. I felt nothing at all, there was no morning sickness and I was just getting along with work and everything else. 'For a few days I felt extremely tired, but I put it down to working 40 to 50 hours a week.' After finishing work the night before at 11.30pm, she woke up with severe backache and called her sister when the pain got worse. Ms Gadsby, 32, who also has son Joel, 11, from a previous relationship, said: 'The aches were getting worse and worse. She asked me how I felt and I said it was as though I was in labour. 'I then noticed a bump had formed on my stomach and knew something wasn't right. The news was even more of a surprise because Ms Gadsby's partner Alan (left) takes medication for Chron's disease that makes having a child risky . 'When I got to hospital they gave me a pregnancy test and I was stunned to hear it had come back positive.' Ms . Gadsby's partner, 35-year-old Alan Jones, was stunned to receive a . phone call at work from nurses at the nearby Good Hope Hospital, Sutton . Coldfield, explaining that he was going to be a father. He said: 'My colleagues had to pick me up from the floor. We hadn't planned the pregnancy at all. I thought it was a wind-up. The news was a particular surprise for Mr Jones, as he suffers from Chron's disease. Doctors had told him he may never be able to start a family because the medication he was on would make it 'too dangerous'. Baby Frankie with his older brother Joel, 11 . Maggie Coleman, Good Hope's maternity clinical services matron and supervisor of midwives, said Ms Gadsby's case was rare. She said: 'I can count on my one hand how many I have seen in my 30-year career here at Good Hope Hospital. 'Women who may be a little taller or overweight tend to show much less [signs of pregnancy], whilst menopausal women and younger busy women who are not expecting to be pregnant will simply not be looking for signs. 'Even a baby's kicking can be easily mistaken for indigestion. 'In some births, such as Kelly's, babies lie with their back against their mother's back. This is called the occipito-posterior (OP) position. In this case If the baby is lying OP or 'back to your back', the pregnant bump may feel squashy and mothers may feel baby kicks in the middle of their abdomen. 'I would like to wish Kelly and her new baby, Frankie, all the best for the future.' A new mother gave birth in her bathroom just hours after being sent home by midwives who insisted she wasn't in labour. Gemma Wotherspoon, 28, phoned the Penrice Hospital in St Austell, Cornwall, when she developed severe back pains on her due date. But despite showing the classic signs of contractions, nurses assured her the birth was imminent and instead advised her to stay home and take paracetamol. Gemma Wotherspoon was told by doctors she wasn't in labour and sent home. Three hours later, she gave birth to baby Ryan in her bathroom . When the pain got worse her husband Alistair, 30, drove her to the hospital. But after being examined nurses again insisted that she was not in labour and discharged her with 'back pain'. She ended up giving birth just two hours after arriving back at home, while sitting on the toilet. Mrs Wotherspoon, from Bodmin, Cornwall, said: 'After they sent me home from hospital I tried to sleep, but by 2.30am the pain had got much worse and I couldn't get comfy. I had all the signs that I was in labour. 'I felt the urge to push so I went to the toilet to try and ease the pain but when I realised what was happening I just sort of gave birth. 'I shouted to Alistair to grab his head, but before I knew it Ryan was in my arms. 'I just took one push and he was out, I had him in my arms and thankfully he was just crying and crying. 'Alistair called the paramedics and they arrived within about seven minutes. 'I can't believe they kept sending me away, it's shocking. Luckily we were all OK, but imagine if we weren't. It's a very scary experience. 'I'm very angry with how I have been let down.' Mrs Wotherspoon later complained to the hospital, which apologised and agreed to reimburse her for any furniture damaged during the birth.","Kelly Gadsby, from Tamworth, was on the pill and had periods as normal .

"A globally-respected financier has revealed that he quit his job running a $2 trillion investment fund after his young daughter wrote him a note pointing out that he had missed 22 landmark events in her life. Mohamed El-Erian's ten-year-old told her dad that he had skipped her first day of school, Halloween parade, her first soccer game of the year and many recitals because he was too busy at work. The California-based investment guru's resignation in May 2013 shocked the financial world. However in a recent interview, Mr El-Erian, who made $100 million in 2011 alone, explained that his young daughter and wife Jamie were at the heart of his decision. Scroll down for video . Mohamed El-Erian, pictured, resigned from $2 trillion PIMCO investment fund in May 2013 to spend more time with his ten-year-old daughter. In a recent interview, he said: 'I was not making nearly enough time for her' Mr El-Erian, pictured with his wife Jamie, who is a lawyer in Laguna Beach, California. The top financier quit his role as head of PIMCO last year so she could spend more time with his family . In an essay for Worth in June, El-Erian, 56, explained his decision. He said: 'About a year ago, I asked my daughter several times to do something - brush her teeth, I think it was - with no success. 'I reminded her that it was not so long ago that she would have immediately responded, and I wouldn’t have had to ask her multiple times; she would have known from my tone of voice that I was serious. 'She asked me to wait a minute, went to her room and came back with a piece of paper. It was a list that she had compiled of her important events and activities that I had missed due to work commitments. Talk about a wake-up call. 'The list contained 22 items, from her first day at school and first soccer match of the season to a parent-teacher meeting and a Halloween parade. And the school year wasn’t yet over.I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, an urgent phone call, sudden to-do. Mr El-Erian's daughter after her first day of school with her mom Jamie (pictured right), her aunt Sherry (left) and her late grandfather Bill Walters, a former Arkansas state senator (center). Mr El-Erian left his top post at PIMCO after his daughter made him a list of milestones he missed - including her first day at school . Mr El-Erian, 56, said that since stepping down from his job, he is available to make his daughter's breakfast and run her to school from their mansion in California (pictured) Dr Mohamed El-Erian, who studied Cambridge, and his wife Jamie El-Erian along with Lord Eatwell after they made a $3millon donation to the university this year . Life at the top: Mohamed El-Erian (pictured second right) attends a dinner with President Obama and other business high-fliers . He added: 'But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. As much as I could rationalize it - as I had rationalized it - my work-life balance had gotten way out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making nearly enough time for her.' El-Erian was born in New York and grew up in Egypt before his father returned to the city to work at the United Nations. In his recent essay, he admitted he was spending far too much time away from home while working for PIMCO. According to Business Insider, El-Erian kept an extremely grueling schedule at PIMCO (Pacific Investment Management Company). He would sleep from 9pm until 1am, then work on his newspaper columns, get to the office at 4.30am and then move from trading floor to his office to take up management duties at 9am. Since resigning, the investor said he and his wife take turns in waking up their daughter, preparing her breakfast and bringing her to school. He said he is also planning a holiday just for himself and his daughter. Jamie El-Erian is a successful lawyer who practices in Laguna Beach, California. El-Erian said instead of one, full-time position, he has taken a 'portfolio' of part-time roles which require far less travelling and allow him greater flexibility. The investor, who was educated at Oxford and Cambridge in the UK, said that he even now had time to pick up his daughter from school. Speaking to Bloomberg after his resignation, El-Erian said: ' I've gone through a transition after 14 great years with PIMCO and I've put together a portfolio of part-time activities that I'm really excited about. I'm also really excited to spend more time with my family and my daughter.' He later told Reuters: 'If I had known that there would be this media circus, I would've done a lot of things differently. 'Was there a way of not going 100 miles an hour and maybe going 50 miles an hour? To be perfectly honest, I didn't explore that option. I never explored.' El-Erian said wanting to spend more time with his family is a cliche but he decided that 'his need to be a good father was greater than his desire to be a good investor'. He decided that he had to readjust his work-life balance in May 2013 after receiving the note from his daughter. Mr El-Erian described his work-life balance being 'out of whack' - so he resigned from PIMCO to spend more time with his wife and daughter. He is pictured in 2011 helping clean up the Orange County coastline with a volunteers as part of PIMCO project . In an interview with Reuters, El-Erian refused to comment on his former boss Bill Gross, only describing the 70-year-old as brilliant. Since leaving PIMCO, El-Erian has become the chief economic adviser at Allianz where he spends 50 per cent of his time. In 2012, President Obama announced El-Erian as the Chair of the president's Global Development Council. The high-flying investor also comments widely in the media - he is a columnist for Bloomberg and contributes to the Financial Times and CNN. It was announced today that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether bond fund manager PIMCO inflated the returns of its Total Return Exchange-Traded Fund  run by founder Bill Gross, who has come under renewed fire from investors this year over the poor performance of his main fund. PIMCO and its owner, Allianz, confirmed the probe after a report in the Wall Street Journal said the SEC investigation into the $3.6 billion exchange-traded fund has been going on for at least a year but has picked up pace in recent weeks.","Mohamed El-Erian, 56, quit his role as CEO of PIMCO investment fund in May 2013 .

Journalist Tim Willcox sparked anger during his coverage of yesterday's rally in Paris, held in memory of the 17 victims of last week's terror attacks, including four Jewish people in a siege at a Kosher supermarket. During a live report from the streets of Paris, Willcox was speaking to a number of participants in the march, including one woman who expressed her fears that Jews were being persecuted, and 'the situation is going back to the days of the 1930s in Europe.' Scroll down for video . BBC reporter Tim Willcox (pictured) has faced calls to resign after he told the daughter of Holocaust survivors: 'Palestinians suffer hugely at Jewish hands as well' during a live broadcast from Paris yesterday . Willcox was speaking to this woman, named as Chava, at the Paris rally who expressed her fears that Jews were being persecuted, and 'the situation is going back to the days of the 1930s in Europe' To this, Willcox, who was broadcasting on the BBC News channel replied: 'Many critics though of Israel's policy would suggest that the Palestinians suffer hugely at Jewish hands as well.' When the woman, shaking her head, responded saying: 'We can't do an amalgam', he told her: 'You understand everything is seen from different perspectives.' She was identified during the broadcast as 'Chava', and told Willcox when she was introduced on screen that she had lived in France for 20 years, but was originally from Israel. She said her parents were from Poland, and came to Israel after the Second World War. She had attended the rally with a friend, Aziz, who is French-born and comes from a Muslim background, with his parents being originally from Algeria. Willcox has today apologised for his comments, taking to Twitter to say he had not meant to cause offence. He wrote: 'Really sorry for any offence caused by a poorly phrased question in a live interview in Paris yesterday - it was entirely unintentional.' Willcox has today apologised for his comments, taking to Twitter to say he had not meant to cause offence . Willcox, pictured, wrote: 'Really sorry for any offence caused by a poorly phrased question in a live interview in Paris yesterday - it was entirely unintentional.' But many viewers also used the social network to express their anger and concerns over Willcox's rally coverage, including historian and BBC presenter Simon Schama. He wrote on Twitter: 'Appalling of @BBCTimWillcox to imply any and all JEWS (not Israelis) responsible for treatment of Palestinians by hectoring lady in Paris.' And added: 'Then he had gall to patronise her at the end - ""you see people see it from all sides"" That Palestinian plight justifies anti-semitic murder?' Jewish Chronicle editor Stephen Pollard also joined the debate, tweeting: 'What is @BBCTimWillcox's problem with Jews? Once is problematic. Twice is a pattern.' The Campaign Against Antisemitism, which works to combat anti-Semitism in Britain, has circulated footage of the incident, and has called on those offended by it to formally complain to the BBC. Director of communications, Jonathan Sacerdoti, told MailOnline Willcox's Twitter apology was 'not really good enough'. 'It's an admission he has done something wrong, but it's incumbent on the BBC to make an on-air apology and to investigate his behaviour.' Many viewers also used the social network to express their anger and concerns over Willcox's rally coverage, including historian and BBC presenter Simon Schama . There have also been calls for the reporter to resign. Twitter user I Support Israel said: 'Retweet if you believe @BBCTimWillcox should be fired for making this anti-Semitic suggestion'. The comment was re-tweeted 41 times, while others expressed their views on the controversy, adding the hashtag #WillcoxMustGo. An online petition was also set up, demanding that Willcox 'personally apologise', and calling for 're-assurance that this constant anti-Semitic behaviour from the BBC will come to an end'. The petition authors said: 'It was the wrong time and place to ask such a disgraceful question. The unity march was a time for France and the rest of the world to come together and unite against the rising threat of terrorism and anti-Semitism, as well as an opportunity to mourn and remember those killed in the horrific attacks. Willcox was in Paris to cover yesterday's rally, held in memory of the 17 victims of last week's terror attacks, including four Jewish people in a siege at a Kosher supermarket . 'Nevertheless, Mr Willcox showed no sensitivity and asked a tasteless question on live TV which has outraged those who have seen the clip, as well as leaving the interviewee speechless and defenceless.' It is not the first time Willcox has been accused of anti-Semitism. In November during a review of the following day's newspapers on the BBC News channel, Willcox, who was anchoring the discussion, faced criticism after  discussion of a story about Labour leader Ed Miliband reportedly losing Jewish support. The BBC said Willcox (pictured) had no intention of causing offence, and had been discussing a wide range of issues with the rally participants . A guest on the programme, political observer Jo Phillips, had referred to a 'Jewish lobby', which had abandoned support for Labour over his condemnation of Israeli attacks on Gaza. There was anger that Willcox had not pulled up the guest on her comments, and had added: 'A lot of these prominent Jewish faces will be very much against the mansion tax'. The BBC defended the comments, and said: 'It was clear that he was not suggesting that Jewish people in particular are against the mansion tax.' Mr Sacerdoti said his organisation and 33 individuals had complained to the BBC about the November broadcast. 'The BBC said there was no anti-Semitism in what he said, but according to the MacPherson definition, if a minority group feels it is anti-Semitic, it should be considered as such,' he said. 'It's obviously offending people.' He added: 'And now he's done it again in an extreme example when people are mourning the deaths of four Jews, among the other victims, and his reaction is to say this to a Jewish woman who is saying it's like the 1930s. 'To somehow bring in mitigating circumstances, is terrible. 'The EUMC's [European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, now the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights] working definition of anti-Semitism includes collective blaming of Jews for the actions of Israel.' Alex Benjamin, Executive Director of Brussels-based group European Friends of Israel, told MailOnline he would 'echo the calls for Willcox to resign'. 'I was not the only one who was utterly disgusted at the deeply patronising, offensive and frankly partisan way he hassled this woman - a woman who as a Parisian Jew is genuinely concerned for her well-being – seeking to justify the abhorrent murders of four jews in Paris with the Israel Palestinian conflict,' he said. 'It was tactless, arrogant and he should at resign.' A BBC spokesman said: 'Tim Willcox has apologised for what he accepts was a poorly phrased question during an in-depth live interview with two friends, one Jewish and of Israeli birth, the other of Algerian Muslim heritage, where they discussed a wide range of issues affecting both the Muslim and Jewish communities in France. He had no intention of causing offence.'","Tim Willcox was covering yesterday's Paris rally for the BBC News channel .

"A British holidaymaker racked up a staggering £20,000 mobile phone bill after she used her internet to upload holiday snaps to Facebook. Shocked Helen Christie, 40, was landed with the massive bill, which is 28 times the amount she paid for her holiday, when she decided to share photos of her trip to Turkey on the social network. But by using her Orange mobile internet to upload the pictures, she ran up data roaming charges which worked out at huge £2,700 per day. Shocked: Helen Christie, above, was enjoying a week away with pals when she ran up the bill . Helen, of Woolwich, South East London, had planned for her trip by buying £6 per day 'travel saver' mobile internet bundle from her network provider. But Orange said that by buying into the deal, she had opted out of the cap on her normal tariff, which limits internet charges to £42 per day. Upon her return, the mother-of-two was faced with monthly repayments of £3,000. Speaking to The Mirror, she said: ""I just thought it might be nice to put a few pictures on Facebook. I didn't have a clue what on earth had gone on. ""I thought it was a wind-up. The whole holiday only cost me £700. It's disgusting. It's scare tactics - people don't realise what these companies are doing."" After a national newspaper contacted Orange, they agreed to cut the bill from £19,656 to £875 because of 'exceptional circumstances' A spokesperson for Orange said: ""The customer used much more data than her chosen bundle. Due to the exceptional circumstances we have offered a significant reduction."" Fearing pressure from Bailiffs, Helen who earns £10,000 per year as an accounts manager, said she plans to fight the revised bill in court. Stung: The bill was more than 28 times the amount that Helen paid for her holiday. She plans to appeal in court . The row comes with the Eurpoean Commission hoping to scrap data roaming charges across Europe completely by 2016. Under current plans, companies will be banned from charging extra for incoming calls to people who are abroad from July 2014. That is the first stage in a move to abandon all other roaming charges by 2016. If . the new rules come into force, mobile providers will either have to . charge customers the same prices for phone calls across the EU, or allow . them to switch providers for the period they are abroad, without . changing their sim card. Currently, the mobile network Three . have taken the biggest step toward scrapping data roaming after they . announced a tariff which allows users to browse the internet in . Australia, Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland and Sweden for . the same price as on their UK plan. Other . networks offer bundles, which allow a set amount of data usage for a . small fee which is then added to the customer's monthly bill. Orange, O2 and T-Mobile all offer packages allowing between 15 and 30 megabytes of data for around two to three pounds per day. Rather . than charge for a specific amount of usage, Vodafone's EuroTraveller . tariff charges a customer £3 per day to use the internet at their UK . price plan whilst abroad in Europe. Networks . are fighting the Euro legislation, insisting that a ban on data roaming . charges will cost the industry £6billion per year. Top tips: Avoid running up huge phone bills abroad . Currently, holiday makers are advised to take precautions to avoid bumper bills, such as turning off data roaming and using free wi-fi. Smartphones will automatically start to update data when they connect to another network on holiday but step-by-step instructions for how to turn off roaming on a range of popular handsets can be found at ofcom.org.uk. Users can connect to the internet at local wi-fi hotspots – often for free – while data roaming on their phone is still switched off or try the ‘old-school’ trick of visiting an internet cafe. Experts recommend buying a booster, which works like an add-on for an existing price plan or package. It boosts the amount of calls, texts and data you can use when not in the UK. Mobile networks offer a range of add-on packages for travellers who want to continue using the internet on holiday. They all have bundles for within Europe, starting at £1 a day for 20 megabytes (20MB) of internet use with Orange, enough for an hour of Facebook, according to Confused.com.  But those heading further afield could find they have less choice. Vodafone’s Data Traveller costs £5 a day for a 25MB daily allowance so holiday makers only pay on the days they use the internet. Orange’s Rest of World add-ons start at £6 a day for 30MB each day but it costs  £8 per MB if users go over their allowance. T-Mobile charges £10 per 10MB outside the EU,  although this rises to £75 for the same deal, depending on the country visited. Some people recommend buying a local SIM card to use when on holiday. However, this will only work for ‘unlocked’ phones and will give holidaymakers a new contact number.  Companies such as 0044 or Lebara allow consumers to buy foreign SIM cards before they go away. To avoid shock bills, experts recommend trying to download films, maps or music before departure. When it comes to calls, the European Commission has vowed landline calls anywhere in Europe will cost the same as ringing friends at home, while mobile calls will be capped at 16p a minute, but there are no plans to prevent high charges for holiday makers venturing further afield. The proposals outlined by the European Commission would 'abolish premiums' within the 28 member states, meaning dialling relatives abroad would cost the same as a long-distance, domestic call. However, Three has become the first UK mobile operator to allow holidaymakers to text and call the UK, as well as go online as part of their current mobile phone contracts. The company launched its ‘Feel at Home scheme,’ which lets Three customers use their phones in the republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden and Denmark without being billed for extra international roaming charges. It is hoped the move will spark a war among mobile phone network providers to let people use their phones abroad without worrying about the consequences.","Bill is more than double holidaymaker's entire annual salary .

"It is the handgun of choice for the good guys in countless Hollywood movies, from Die Hard to Mission Impossible. Now the Glock has been chosen by the Ministry of Defence to replace the trusty old Cold War-era Browning pistol after almost 50 years. More than 25,000 are being purchased for Britain’s Armed Forces under a £9million contract. Kitted out: The Ministry of Defence has purchased 25,000 Glock 17 9mm handguns to be used by troops . Testing: Royal Marine Sergeant Steve Lord tests a Glock 17 9mm pistol. The gun has become the first new sidearm to be issued to UK troops since 1967 . First choice: The Mod undertook rigorous testing before choosing the new firearm, firing 40,000 over the testing period . It is the first time since 1967 - before the Troubles in Northern Ireland - that UK troops have been issued with a new sidearm. Defence chiefs say the Austrian-made Glock 17 Gen 4 is lighter, carries more bullets, fires more quickly and accurately, and is safer to handle than the Browning. While the replacement was not ordered in response to any specific threat, military commanders are clear that it will make it easier for troops in Afghanistan to respond to ‘green on blue’ attacks. Replacement: A Glock 17 9mm pistol, top, and its predecessor, a Browning 9mm, below. The MoD said the Browning was becoming too expensive to maintain . On Monday, Sapper Richard Walker, 23, became the 24th British serviceman shot dead by an Afghan army or police turncoat. The Glock takes less than a second to draw and fire, compared to the Browning which even for an expert often takes four or five seconds to remove from its holster, load the chamber and shoot. Colonel Peter Warden, head of the light weapons team at the Defence Equipment and Support organisation, said: ‘It won’t specifically address that [green on blue attacks] but overall it does improve the ability of guys to shoot back.’ Sergeant Steve Lord, 35, a Royal Marine based at the Commando Training Centre in Lympstone, Devon, said: ‘If I can pick it up quicker, the faster I can shoot. ‘The faster I can shoot, the more chance I have of winning a fight.’ The Glock 17s will be delivered within weeks and troops deployed to Afghanistan will be among the first to carry them. The MoD began searching for a new sidearm in 2010 because the Browning was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. Col Warden said: ‘It’s like a car. There is a point where it becomes more effective to buy a new model rather than continue to maintain the old one.’ He said that pistols were also increasingly useful during counter-insurgency operations, such as in Helmand, where soldiers mingle among the population. Lightweight: The Glock 17 is made from plastic and weighs 650g, around two-thirds of the Browning . Efficient: Defence chiefs say the Austrian-made . Glock 17 Gen 4 is lighter, carries more bullets, fires more quickly and . accurately, and is safer to handle than the Browning . ‘In the 1970s and 1980s the infantry was trained for long-range engagements with the enemy,’ he said. ‘Since Iraq, the role has changed. Now it is much more about compound clearance, getting closer to where the threat and enemy is. Rifles are less useful.’ Defence chiefs conducted extensive laboratory tests and field trials in jungle, desert and Arctic environments, firing 40,000 rounds before choosing the Glock. Made of plastic instead of metal, the gun weighs 650g - around two-thirds of the Browning. It is semi-automatic allowing a large number of rounds to be fired off quickly. Each magazine carries up to 33 9mm bullets, compared to 13 in the Browning. It also has three safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge, including a ‘mini-trigger’ built into the main trigger so it is unlikely to fire if pressed unintentionally. ‘You can drop it on the floor and it won’t go off, or kick it around and it won’t go off,’ said Col Warden. The Glock was designed in 1982 by Austrian radiator factory manager Gaston Glock, responding to a tender put out by the country’s military. The firearm was first introduced to police in the U.S. after they found themselves outgunned by violent criminal gangs. It is now used by two-thirds of all U.S. police departments, including the specialist FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration. Glocks are also issued by the Firearms Command of the Metropolitan Police Service and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The pistol has featured in Hollwood blockbusters including The Fugitive, the Bourne Ultimatum and Skyfall and numerous TV shows, such as Miami Vice and The Wire. But the Glock has also made headlines for more sombre reasons . Norwegian far-Right extremist Anders Behring Breivik used one to kill most of the 67 people he shot dead during his massacre in Norway in July 2011. And Jared Lee Loughner, used a Glock to shoot US Senator Gabrielle Giffords and kill six others in a grocery store shootings in Tuscon, Arizona, in January 2011. Small beginnings: The Glock was designed in 1982 by Austrian radiator factory manager Gaston Glock, responding to a tender put out by the country's military.","25,000 Glock handguns are being purchased by Ministry of Defence .

"A parking space has been put on the market for a record-breaking £300,000 - almost twice the price of the average UK home. The spot in London's exclusive Hyde Park Gardens measures just 11ft x 12ft, but its price tag is almost double the £162,000 paid for the average house sold in England and Wales last month. Estate agents Kay & Co, who last year sold two nearby parking spaces for £250,000 each, said several people had already expressed an interest in snapping up the six-figure spot. Eye-watering: The 11ft x 21ft parking space in London's exclusive Hyde Park Gardens, seen left in an aerial shot and right, is on the market for £300,000 . The agent said parking spaces are in hot demand in Hyde Park Gardens, where houses cost up to £15million. Its buyer will be paying £1,299 per square foot for the privilege of owning a central space in Westminster. Exclusive: The parking space in the millionaires' enclave costs almost twice as much as the average UK home . The 231 sq ft parking spot, which is . being sold with a 91-year lease, costs £500 more than a nearby studio . flat sold by the agent last week. Hyde Park Gardens' residents pockets may be deep enough to splash out £300,000 on a parking space without breaking a sweat. But mere mortals might prefer to spend the six-figure sum on something a little more spacious - a five bedroom home in Leeds, perhaps. An executive five bedroom property in Rothwell complete with gardens, driveway and a detached garage is on the market for the same price as the tiny central London space. Buyers with £300,000 to spend could also snap up a luxury apartment in the Orion building in Birmingham city centre, or a two bedroom apartment in a stone-fronted period building in Clifton, one of the most desirable areas of Bristol. In London, the same figure could pay for a three bedroom terraced house in Canning Town, a three bedroom flat in Shepherds Bush, or a studio flat in the City within walking distance of Chancery Lane. It costs more than a Rolls-Royce, and 15 times as much as the BMW 1 Series which seen in the space in the above picture. Matthew Abernethy, associate director at Kay & Co, said: 'There are a number of properties in the area which range from £1 to £15 million and there are not enough parking spaces for all the residents. 'Parking in this part of prime central London is always scarce and the fact that people will pay more than the price of a small flat for the privilege of their own parking space is indicative of the desirability of having parking in Westminster. 'We anticipate that the space will attract interest from local residents eager to secure parking close by.' Parking fines in Westminster range between £80 and £130 depending on the severity of the offence, and they are halved if paid in less than 14 days. This means, on the basis of the £40 fine, it would take more than 20 years - 7,300 days - to rack up £300,000 in fines. However, over the period of the 91 year lease, it works out at just £9.20 per day to park in the space. In 2011 an underground parking space near Harrods was put on the market for £200,000. It is not just London where the price of a parking space has gone through the roof. Three spots in St. Ives, Cornwall sold last year for a combined £160,000.","Parking spot in London's Hyde Park Gardens measures just 11ft x 21ft .

"McDonald’s will start giving customers the choice of a salad, fruit or vegetable as a substitute for french fries in its value meals in a bid to target consumers wanting healthier options. McDonald’s Corp. will roll out the change early next year in the U.S., where people will be able to pick a salad instead of fries at no extra cost. McDonald’s says it already lets customers make such swaps in some countries, such as France. Healthy options: McDonald's will start letting customers swap fries for salads in the new year for no extra cost in value meals . But now it says it now work to make the options available in 20 of its biggest markets around the world, which represent 85 percent of sales. McDonald’s, which has more than 34,000 locations around the world, said the change will be in place in 30 to 50 percent of the areas within the next three years and 100 percent the regions by 2020. The world’s biggest hamburger chain made the announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City, where CEO Don Thompson made an appearance on stage with former President Bill Clinton. In an interview before the announcement, Thompson said McDonald’s is looking at developing other healthy sides that will appeal to customers. He noted that the company could also take the fruits and vegetables it offers in other parts of the world, such as cups of corn and kiwi on a stick, and make them more widely available. 'What is it that customers will choose, and what will they eat?' Thompson said. 'What we don’t want to do is just put something on the menu and say, hey, we did it. We really want consumption.' Value pack: The humble hamburger is usually accompanied by fries in McDonald's value meals, but soon vegetables and fruit will be an option . McDonald’s also announced that it would use its packaging to make healthier options more appealing to kids. For example, a side of carrots might come in a more colorfully designed bag. Parents will still be able to order soda with Happy Meals, but McDonald’s says it will only promote milk, juice and water on menu boards and in advertising. All advertising to kids will include a 'fun nutrition or children’s well-being' message, the company said. Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the health advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, said taking soda off the menu as an option for Happy Meals was a big step that other fast-food chains should follow. But she said the push to include positive nutrition messages in ads to kids could serve to give McDonald’s a 'health halo' that it doesn’t necessarily deserve. 'The changes McDonald’s are making make the food somewhat healthier. But I don’t think a hamburger, some applies and fries is something I’d call healthy,' she said. McDonald's is also trying to encourage consumers to drink low fat milk drinks instead of sodas . The announcement comes as McDonald’s faces criticism from health advocates who say it promotes bad eating habits. After years of outperforming its rivals, McDonald’s is also struggling to shake its fast-food image and keep up with shifting tastes. Late last year, the company reported its first monthly sales decline in nearly a decade and sales performance around the world has been choppy ever since. To better reflect the way people are eating, McDonald’s recently started giving customers the choice to substitute egg whites in all its breakfast sandwiches. It also rolled out chicken wraps, which are partly intended to go after people who want foods they feel are fresher or healthier. Earlier in the week, rival Burger King rolled out lower-calorie french fries, reflecting the growing demand for better-for-you options. McDonald’s marketing to children is also an ongoing issue. A recent study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, for example, found that the chain’s ads targeting children often emphasize toy giveaways and movie tie-ins, rather than food. And at its latest annual shareholders meeting, a 9-year-old girl made headlines after she stood to ask Thompson to stop 'tricking' kids into eating the company’s food. The girl was with her mother, who was affiliated with Corporate Accountability, which has pressured McDonald’s to changes its marketing practices to kids. The criticism is clearly a sensitive topic for Thompson, who noted that the Alliance for a Healthier Generation was among the first organizations that approached the company to use its “marketing might” to help kids. The group, which is working with McDonald’s on its new health goals, was founded by the Clinton Global Initiative and the American Heart Association.“Others have said, ‘McDonald’s, don’t advertise to kids,’” Thompson said. “We’ve always felt like, wow, if we had the impact that you think we have, why don’t we leverage it to do something great for kids?”Howell Wechsler, CEO of Alliance for a Healthier Generation, said the commitments made by McDonald’s were worked out over the course of more than a year. He said the final agreement could help change the way people eat over time, given McDonald’s enormous reach.","McDonald's CEO Don Thompson made announcement at Clinton Global Initiative in NYC .

"Thierry Henry has vowed to draw on the experience of working under Arsene Wenger and Pep Guardiola to ensure his coaching career will be a rip-roaring success. The French legend, 37, has quit the New York Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years in the MLS and although he is yet to officially hang up his boots, a role on the sidelines beckons. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger would love to have the striker he made into one of the best in the world as part of his coaching team at the Emirates.

And Henry, who will take some time out before making his next move, would love the chance to pass on his vast knowledge and experience to the next crop of stars. Playing for managers like Wenger and Guardiola has geared him up for the next phase of his career. 'Everyone that you work with throughout you career, whether it be the right thing or the wrong thing, you learn,' said an emotional Henry. 'If you are not stupid with it, open your eyes and take from it what you need and what you don't then you will make your own recipe for success. 'You are always learning and I always learn more in the difficult moments – that is when you find out about yourself.' Henry plans to keep his Manhattan apartment and will take a few weeks out to consider his next move. He added: 'It is all a bit blurry right now. We will see what will happen soon. Going back to Arsenal? That is the wish. They say Christmas is coming soon, it is a wish but it is not something which will happen straight away. 'Everyone knows how much I love the club, my feelings about them. It is a wish right now, I only announced I was leaving New York on Monday so I am not trying to get out of it but it has only been a day. 'In the tough moments you learn a lot. You can see from my performances this season that I am still able to play. Henry spreads his arms wide and celebrates to the Arsenal fans after scoring against Inter Milan . The former Arsenal captain celebrates after scoring against West Brom and could be set for a third stint . 'There is nothing better than trying to help a team-mate mentally and make them a better player and it those moments which I will cherish. That is the mentality that I had when I came here - to try and make people better.' Henry has been seen as a real success story in the MLS - scoring 51 goals in 122 matches following his move from Barcelona in 2010. He was, though, unable to make it a fairy-tale ending as the Red Bulls' hopes of being crowned MLS champions were crushed by New England last weekend who will meet Robbie Keane's LA Galaxy in Sunday's final. With French newspaper L'Equipe launching a campaign to get national manager Didier Deschamps to hand the 37 year-old a final farewell for Les Blues against Brazil in March, it promises to be a very long, drawn out goodbye. Henry acknowledges fans after their 4-3 aggregate loss to end the MLS season and his time in New York . Henry has steadfastly refused to talk about his future despite making it clear he would not be signing a new deal to replace the one which ran out at the end of the MLS season. But he admitted: 'I didn't want to be the focus to be on me. I had a blast. It was tough personally for me but I embraced the MLS and New York. It's not easy, if players come here at a late stage in their career and they are not ready to perform, it is not like that. 'The decision was pretty easy for me. People were asking me about retirement and I don't know about that yet but I knew it was time to leave New York. 'It is emotional. I can't scream at these guys anymore – I am sure they won't miss that. When get upset it is for the good of the team. I always try my best. 'I will miss being in the dressing room. People see my competitive side but I like to joke too. I will keep my place here, watch some games, provided they will let me come back!' Henry during his final game for New York Red Bulls . I am taking this opportunity to announce that unfortunately Saturday was my last game for the New York Red Bulls. The decision has always been that I would leave after the duration of my contract and although that was never going to change, I didn't want it to distract from the progress of the team. I have immensely enjoyed my four-and-a-half years here and would like to thank everyone involved with this club who has made my time here so enjoyable. Thanks must go particularly to Erik Soler, Hans Backe, Gerard Houllier, Andy Roxburgh, Mike Petke, all my team-mates, the technical staff, medical staff, all the personnel who work for the Red Bull organisation, the MLS and of course the owner Mr Mateschitz whose vision and passion brought me to this wonderful city. A special mention must go to the Red Bull fans who have supported this team through the good, the bad and the ugly times in the sun, rain and snow. You guys have really meant a lot to me and thank you for all your wonderful support. I will now take the next few weeks to reflect and decide on the next chapter of my career. Thank you all .

"A medical school graduate died early Saturday after Connecticut police subdued him twice with a stun gun in an 8-hour period. Lashano Gilbert, a Bahamian man who attended medical school in Cuba, was in New London visiting family when police say he tried to carjack a woman. Officers first subdued the 31-year-old when his arrest turned to a struggle. They did so again when he attacked officers in the police station. What killed him? Bahamian medical school graduate Lashano Gilbert, 31, was tasered twice by New London, Connecticut police over the weekend and subsequently died . Heard voices: State police have opened an investigation into what killed Gilbert, who officers say was acting erratically and said he heard voices . He died en route to a hospital and now state police have placed the matter under investigation. Medical examiners performed an autopsy Sunday. Results of a toxicology test won't come for weeks. It's possible those results could shed some light on the state Gilbert was in when police first encountered him Friday. NBC Connecticut reports that when police say Gilbert, while in an 'altered state of mind' and 'speaking in a bizarre manner,' attempted a carjacking. Gilbert reportedly told police he was hearing voices and when he behaved in a threatening manner toward them, they used the stun gun. He was taken to a hospital and treated, then taken to a New London police station. Police say while in a holding cell Gilbert began twisting his pants as if to make a noose. He bum rushed police when they opened the cell to take the pants. In the commotion, Gilbert was tasered a second time. He was rushed to the hospital again and died around 3:30am Saturday. New London's state's attorney and New London police chief immediately asked the state police to start an investigation, according to NBC Connecticut. That investigation remained open as medical examiners autopsied Gilbert's remains.","Lashano Gilbert was a Bahamian national who attended medical school in Cuba and was visiting family in Connecticut .

"The mother of a toddler who was slapped during a flight has broken her silence, saying she was scared to death as a ‘drunk’ fellow passenger slapped her son after spouting off a racial slur, and now the man who did it is out of a job. Jessica Bennett, 33, was aboard the Delta flight from Minnesota to Atlanta with her adopted son Jonah on February 8 when the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears.' She said she was shocked to hear the man seated next to her, Joe Rickey Hundley, demand that she 'shut that n****r baby up.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land . Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that (n-word) baby up' Accused: Joe Rickey Hundley is accused of first racially abusing, then physically assaulting 19-month old Jonah Bennett . She told ABC News: 'I said, ""What did you just say?"" And he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to my ear and he said it directly into my ear.' But she couldn't have imagined what happened next, as Hundley allegedly slapped Jonah. When I looked at Jonah’s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death.' Mrs Bennett, of Minneapolis, Minnesota, says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since. Hundley's lawyer Marcia Shein, told ABC News that no one should rush to judgment in her client's case, and he will be pleading not guilty. Trauma: Mrs Bennett says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has since become 'apprehensive to strangers' Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby' But the task of proving his innocence may be difficult as Bennett family attorney John Thompson told the network that there were numerous witnesses who saw Hundley strike Jonah - including a federal air marshal. According to The Smoking Gun, Hundley has been charged with simple assault after the incident. Hundley was charged with simple . assault in federal court in Atlanta last week. If convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in prison. The 60-year-old, who is the president of an aircraft parts manufacturer based in . Idaho, denied slapping the child or using racial language. He claims . that he did 'ask the mother to quiet the child.' Hundley was suspended from his job as president of Unitech Composites and Structures, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Joe Rickey Hundley faces up to a year in prison if found guilty of simple assault . Al Haase, president and chief . executive of AGC Aerospace and Defense, Composites Group - Unitech's . parent company - said the firm was taking the matter seriously. 'In accordance with our company's . personal conduct policy, we have suspended the employee pending . investigation,' Al Haase, president and CEO of AGC, said in a statement. 'We wish to emphasize that the behavior that . has been described is contradictory to our values, embarrassing and . does not in any way reflect the patriotic character of the men and women . of diverse backgrounds who work tirelessly in our business,' Haase added. The company later amended its statement adding that 'he is no longer with the company.' AGC did not specify whether Hundley was fired or if he left voluntarily. Hundley said he was traveling to Atlanta to visit a . hospitalized relative, described his emotional state as 'distraught' and that he had one alcoholic drink on the aircraft. However, . Bennett told The Smoking Gun that she believed Hundley was intoxicated. The mother said that he 'reeked of alcohol', was 'stumbling around . wasted' and he consumed several double vodkas during the flight. Bennett says Hundley told her that Jonah was too big to be a 'lap baby.' Agent Cheney added that Bennett . received help from other passengers on the Delta flight. Todd Wooten, . who was seated 12 rows ahead, told authorities that he 'heard derogatory . language coming from the rear of the aircraft' and went to see what was . going on. 'According to Mr. Wooten,' Cheney wrote, 'he saw Joe Rickey Hundley strike' the child. Hundley pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in . 2007 after he was arrested following a quarrel with his girlfriend.

"David Cameron was urged to ditch EU green energy targets last night, amid warnings they will add £150 to the average family’s bills over the next five years. The Prime Minister will travel to Brussels this afternoon to debate stretching new targets that will require Britain to slash carbon emissions by 40 per cent by 2030. But a new report from the respected think tank Open Europe warns that existing targets are already putting Britain’s economy and living standards at risk, and calls for them to be ditched. Ministers insist that the targets will strengthen Britain’s energy supplies and, in the long term, produce thousands of ‘green jobs’. But today’s study, based on an analysis of official Government figures, suggests that EU green measures have already added £59 to the average dual fuel energy bill in this country. It suggests this figure will rise to £149 by 2020 as the Government strives to meet a binding target of producing 15 per cent of electricity from renewable sources. Today’s report warns that the impact on business will be even greater, with the average medium-sized firm set to see its energy bills rise by 23 per cent as a result of green measures emanating from Brussels. And it says the potential economic benefits of meeting the targets have been grossly over-stated. The report’s author Raoul Ruparel said Mr Cameron should now push for the targets to be abandoned. If other EU leaders refuse, the UK should drop them unilaterally. He added: ‘Despite admirable goals the EU’s green policies have imposed huge costs but delivered limited benefit and are marred by conflicting objectives. 'With people in the UK concerned about the cost of living, business still struggling to balance their books and Europe needing a more flexible energy supply to wean itself off dependence on Russian gas, a radical re-think of the EU’s energy policy is now vital. Neither the EU nor the UK can afford to waste more time on a costly and failing policy.’ The Department for Energy and Climate Change last night said it ‘does not recognise’ the Open Europe analysis – and insisted that the drive for green energy was reducing bills. The existing EU targets require the UK to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources like wind farms from about four per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent by 2020 . A spokesman said: ‘We don’t recognise the way these figures have been presented. We estimate that, in 2013, household energy bills were, on average, around five per cent lower than they would have been in the absence of all our energy and climate change policies. In 2020, we estimate that our policies will continue to reduce energy bills. ‘We need a diverse energy mix that includes renewable sources like wind and solar in order to reduce our reliance on imports from often volatile parts of the world.’ The existing EU targets require the UK to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources like wind farms from about four per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent by 2020 – the fastest increase in the EU . Today’s report says this will require about 30 per cent of electricity to come from alternative sources, mostly on-shore wind, which enjoys large subsidies from the taxpayer. Today’s report suggests this would be dwarfed by potential savings of up to £21 billion that would be achieved by ignoring the targets. File picture . The targets are legally binding and Britain could face swingeing fines from Brussels of more than £220 million a year if it abandons them unilaterally. But today’s report suggests this would be dwarfed by potential savings of up to £21 billion that would be achieved by ignoring the targets – money that could be ploughed into insulating homes and improving energy efficiency. The study also suggests that projected benefits of meeting the targets have been based on a series of ‘flawed assumptions’. Most importantly, the EU initiative has not led to a global deal on emissions. As a result the benefit to the UK of £160 billion, which was predicted in 2009, has instead turned into a likely net cost of £17 billion. In addition, the study says that the plan has failed to boost Britain’s energy security and has instead exacerbated a potential energy crunch’. Downing Street yesterday said it supported the drive to cut EU carbon emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, but said any new deal needed to be ‘cost-effective, fair and flexible’.","Thinktank says existing targets are already putting Britain’s economy at risk .

"A homeless handyman from Florida has been arrested and charged with the killing of an 85-year-old widow who was discovered dead inside her home by her daughter and son-in-law. Ronald Citarelli, 49, was taken into custody Tuesday on charges of first-degree murder and burglary in connection to the death of Barbara Minardi in Deltona, Florida. Also on Tuesday the Volusia County Sheriff's Office released the heart-breaking 911 call placed by Miss Minardi's son-in-law after he and his wife discovered the elderly woman dead inside her home on Omaha Driver just before 9pm Monday. Scroll down for video . Brutal crime: Ronald Citarelli, 49 (left), has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 85-year-old widow Barbara Minardi (right) in Deltona, Florida . Shocking discovery: Minardi's daughter and son-in-law came by her house on Omaha Drive Monday evening to check up on her, only to find the octogenarian dead from blunt-force trauma . Gut-wrenching call: Don Callison, Minardi's son-in-law , called 911 to report the murder as his hysterical wife (pictured right) wailed in the background . On the call, Barbara Minardi's daughter, Cindy Callison, could be heard wailing and sobbing uncontrollably while her husband, Don, tries to give information to the emergency dispatcher, reported WKMG. Struggling to keep his composure, Mr Callison tells the female 911 operator that he and his wife stopped by Barbara Minardi's home at around 8.45pm to check up on her after failing to reach her by phone all the day. The house was locked and there was no light inside, but the blinds were open. The Callisons also noticed that Minardi's Nissan was gone from her driveway. When the couple entered the house, Cindy Callison, a registered nurse, discovered her mother's lifeless body. When asked by the emergency dispatcher if CPR might help, Don Callison said that his mother-in-law was dead but asked her to send a paramedic for his hysterical wife who suffers from a heart condition. It is believed that the octogenarian, who had spent 13 years volunteering with the sheriff's office, died from blunt-force trauma. An autopsy will be performed to determine the exact cause of death. Busted: Citarelli, a homeless handyman, was picked up by police just hours after the killing when the victim's stolen car was spotted next to his acquaintances' home 7 miles away from the crime scene . About three hours later, Ronald Citarelli was apprehended by deputies acting on a tip about a sighting of Barbara Minardi's stolen car just 7 miles from the crime scene. The 2010 grey Nissan Altima was found parked outside a house on Comstock Drive belonging to Citarelli's acquaintances. Officers set up a stakeout outside the residence and collared Citarelli as he was leaving the house on foot. They also recovered some stolen property connecting him to Minardi’s killing. According to investigators, Ronald Citarelli knew Barbara Minardi because he had recently installed flooring in her home. Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson had some harsh words for the man suspected of killing the woman he described as the unsung hero of the department who never sought any credit for her hard work. ‘I think he should get the chair. Of course we don't have that anymore, but he should get the death penalty. He deserves the death penalty,’ Johnson told WFTV. According to the woman's grieving family, Barbara Minardi had been living alone since 1999, when her husband lost his battle with cancer. Despite her advanced age, the retiree was independent and active, joining social clubs and enjoying spending time with friends and family, reported The Daytona Beach News-Journal. To keep herself busy, in 2001 Minardi joined the sheriff's office in Deltona as a volunteer, doing filing work, answering phones and putting together DNA kits. Big family: Cindy and Don Callison, pictured left with their granddaughter. Mrs Minardi (right) is survived by nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren . Keeping busy: Despite her advanced age, Minardi was very independent and active . Targeted: Citarelli was familiar with Minardi and knew the widow was living alone because he had installed her flooring recently . Cindy and Don Callison were shocked to learn that Ronald Citarelli, whom they described as a pleasant 'smooth talker,' has been charged with the murder. Mrs Callison recalled how one time Citarelli showed up to do work on her mother's floors with two women in tow - one of them pregnant - whom he introduced as his sisters. The elderly homeowner even donated some furniture to the expectant mother, Cindy Callison said. Mrs Minardi is survived by four grown children, nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.","Ronald Citarelli, 49, arrested and charged with first-degree murder and burglary in the death of Barbara Minardi .

"Iker Casillas has claimed he is not immortal after losing his place in the Spain team to Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea and being linked with a move away from Real Madrid. The 33-year-old, who has 158 international caps and captained Spain to glory at the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2008 and Euro 2012, has come under increasing pressure for club and country after a series of disappointing displays. 'I'm not immortal,' Casillas told AS after being benched for Spain's 4-0 win against Luxembourg. 'I will not last forever.' Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas watches on as Miroslav Stoch's header bounces past him to seal Slovakia's win . Earlier in the game Casillas failed to stop a speculative free-kick by Juraj Kucka, who flipped in celebration . The defeat cost Casillas his place in Spain's starting XI for their next qualification game against Luxembourg . 'Everybody has to make their own decision about when to leave the national team, but I feel good, strong and with the desire to help my country do the best we can to be in France and to win the tournament, which isn't going to be easy.' De Gea started in Casillas's place for the win against Luxembourg on Sunday, after the latter performed poorly in the 2-1 defeat to Slovakia on October 9. Spain boss Vicente del Bosque has told both goalkeepers that no immediate decision has been made about who will be No 1, and urged the pair to challenge one another for a starting spot. Age: 33 . Caps: 158 . Clubs: Real Madrid . Honours: 5 La Liga titles, 3 Champions League titles, 2 UEFA Super Cup . Age: 23 . Caps: 3 . Clubs: Atletico Madrid, Manchester United . Honours: Premier League, Europa League, UEFA Super Cup . 'We had decided to make changes and we have to make sure there is an easy transition. Both can play. They have to get used to the change bit by bit, as much David as Iker,' Del Bosque told reporters. 'I wasn't taken aback by what Del Bosque said because I have a fantastic relationship with him,' Casillas replied. 'He said the same thing to me and I didn't take it personally. I'm not going to be able to play forever. There are players coming through and I don't view it badly at all.' De Gea is expected to make Spain's No 1 jersey his own for years to come after starting against Luxembourg . Casillas was forced to watch the action unfold as Spain romped to a comfortable 4-0 victory in Luxembourg . Diego Costa, who scored his first goal for his country on his sixth appearance, is congratulated by Marc Bartra . On his mistakes against Slovakia, which included failing to keep out a speculative first-half free-kick from Juraj Kucka that gave the hosts the lead, he said: 'After a game that you didn't win things go through your mind, you talk to yourself, the same as when your little brother plays a trick on you and you think: ""I'll kill him."" It's a fixed expression. 'Obviously I'll keep going with the national team and for that reason I have to fight for my place with my club. But my idea is to keep playing for the national team. 'Nobody has been unfair on me. When you have played for a team like Real Madrid or Spain for so long, people demand you be the best, the player you always have been. 'You have to keep going, soak up the pressure and respond how you know how, by playing football. But over these years I'll remember the good times more than the bad times, which I think are better.' De Gea, centre, and Kiko Casilla, back left, watch Casillas make a smart stop in Spain training . Despite Del Bosque picking De Gea ahead of Casillas for Spain's latest game, the experienced goalkeeper has been given the backing of Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti. 'Of course it's nice when your manager speaks well of you,' he said, 'but not just about me, also about Alvaro Arbeloa, who he mentioned the other day, and Cristiano Ronaldo. It's good because the link we have with the manager is positive and it needs to be throughout the season.' Reports in Spain have also suggested that Casillas may lose his club spot to De Gea, with Madrid linked with a lucrative move for the United shot-stopper. 'I feel loved in the Bernabeu [despite fans whistling him in recent games],' Casillas insisted. 'Nobody likes to be whistled but the fans are sovereign and they can express themselves however they like. I have to play well and hopefully at the end of the season we'll be able to come together at Cibeles [a famous square in Madrid] after winning a title.' Despite being booed by Real Madrid fans this season, Casillas says he still feels loved at the Bernabeu .","David de Gea started  for Spain in their 4-0 win against Luxembourg .

Phil Neville made 386 appearances in all for Manchester United in 11 years at the club . After leaving Manchester United, Neville moved to Everton, where he played for eight seasons . And Neville is under no illusions as to how big a role that has played in United's indifferent start to the season. He told www.manutd.com: 'It's been a bit up and down for United. The biggest problem is the amount of injuries - to have nine or 10 out, particularly in key areas of the pitch, means you're always going to struggle. 'The time to judge this team is when everybody is fit. People are having a go at the defence but there have been no centre-backs fit all season. Neville was part of the coaching staff under the David Moyes and Ryan Giggs tenures at Manchester United last season but was not retained by Louis van Gaal . 'Soon, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling will be back and the manager can start playing his best pairing at centre-back. 'I'm sure these players will come good. I've got every faith in them. I've coached them, played with and against them, and I know the qualities they have got.' United entertain another of Neville's former teams Everton on Sunday, with the 37-year-old unsure how Roberto Martinez's side will fare at Old Trafford, on the back of a near 4,000 mile trip to Russia in mid-week owing to Europa League commitments. He added: 'I think to come back from Russia and play on Sunday at 12 o'clock is really difficult, from past experience, so I feel United have got to have a fast start and keep the tempo high to make sure Everton feel the effects of the Europa League game. 'Everton have let in too many goals which is unlike them, and every goal has been an individual error. But it was their best defensive performance at Anfield [last weekend] when they cut out the silly mistakes and became hard to beat.'","The former Manchester United player and coach believes the Red Devils'  form has been severely hampered by their injury problems .

"Rail minister Claire Perry has attacked the 'goodies' being offered to Scotland to keep it in the Union . Two-thirds of English MPs want generous subsidies to Scotland to be axed if the country voted to stay in the UK. David Cameron sparked fury among Tory MPs this week by pledging to keep the controversial Barnett formula, as part of a desperate bid to persuade Scots to vote No to independence. Even his ministers were last night in open revolt over the issue, with Transport Minister Claire Perry warning the Prime Minister to stop handing out ‘financial party bags’ to Alex Salmond. The formula, which has been the source of resentment for years, means that public spending per head is £1,623 a year higher in Scotland than in England. A poll last night revealed that 63 per cent of English MPs now want to axe the formula. The survey, by Dods Polling, found this included 83 per cent of Conservatives, 41 per cent of Labour MPs and 78 per cent of Liberal Democrats. Mrs Perry broke cover before the polls in Scotland had even closed to warn against handing ‘goodies’ to Edinburgh without also introducing a fairer deal for England. Scroll down for video . Writing in her local paper, the Wiltshire Gazette, she said it is likely that Parliament will be recalled in the coming days to debate the fallout from the vote. She added: ‘If the result is a narrow No, this will be a running sore in politics for years to come with demands from Holyrood every few years for another go at the question. 'If there is a proposal to allow devolution of local taxation, as well maintaining the current level of funding as a dollop from the UK Parliament, then that can hardly be equitable for those of us in all other areas in the non-Scottish Union.’ The Saltire and the Union flag were held aloft on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh this morning ahead of the referendum today . Defence minister Anna Soubry also acknowledged yesterday that greater devolution to Scotland ‘will cause controversy in Wales and England’. Many MPs believe Mr Cameron made a mistake by agreeing to keep the Barnett formula under pressure from Gordon Brown. They are also pressing for Scottish MPs to be barred from voting on English matters, particularly if Scotland is handed new powers over tax and benefits. Tory MP Anne-Marie Morris said Mr Cameron’s policy to offer Scotland devo max was ‘not thought through, and is concerning many of my constituents who feel it is unfair’. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed a joint declaration promising to devolve more powers to Scotland in the event of a 'No' vote . Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said neither the party nor the public would accept a devolution deal that fails to address English concerns. He said: ‘The devolution settlement introduced by Labour was unbalanced and created two different classes of MP. ‘That should have been corrected already in the interest of democracy and fairness.’ Government sources insist Mr Cameron is ‘very aware’ of the anger over the so-called ‘English question’. He is expected to come forward with proposals to curb the voting rights of Scottish MPs as part of any new devolution settlement. But several Tory MPs warned that they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to Scotland unless the Barnett formula is also scrapped. Tory MP Christopher Chope said: ‘The party leaders don’t have the authority to make a bribe on behalf of the people of the UK. ‘Taxation is an issue for Parliament. We don’t legislate by presidential-style decree.’ Ed Miliband was last night facing criticism over his shambolic No campaign, amid reports that 30 per cent of Labour supporters are poised to vote Yes – up from 18 per cent last month. The Labour leader spent the final week of the campaign touring Scotland. But he was escorted to safety this week after being jostled by Yes supporters during a trip to an Edinburgh shopping centre. He then pulled out of two events on the closing day of campaigning. And Mr Miliband’s poor personal ratings in Scotland mirror his ratings in England, despite low levels of Scottish support for the Conservatives. Henry McLeish, the former first minister of Scotland, said the No campaign led by the Labour leader had been negative and disorganised, adding: ‘If it is a no vote, Gordon Brown will have been largely responsible for that. If it’s a Yes then there will be a lot of questions.’","Claire Perry attacks the 'financial goody bags' on offer to Edinburgh .

"Hundreds of thousands of mothers-to-be should give birth at home or in midwife-led units rather than in hospital, the health watchdog says. Almost half of the 700,000 women who have babies every year in England and Wales are at such low risk of complications they do not need to visit the labour ward, says NICE. New guidelines published today say a smaller, midwife-led unit is just as safe as hospital for first-time mothers. Bonding: Almost half of women could have a home birth without severe risk, say new guidelines (file photo) For those having their second child, a home delivery is just as safe as in hospital and usually a far more joyful experience. Yet figures show that just 2.3 per cent of women currently have home deliveries and a further 4 per cent in midwife units, while the remainder head to hospital. It marks a major shift in guidelines, which had previously urged caution over home births as the risks were deemed higher. The watchdog says it has now examined new evidence, including an Oxford University study of 64,000 women, which showed that home births and units were safer because they are less likely to involve high-risk interventions such as caesarean sections, epidurials or deliveries with forceps. Such procedures may be carried out too readily by doctors, while midwives are thought to have a more patient approach, it says. The big debate: The watchdog said it had studied new evidence including a study of 64,000 women . The research did, however, show that home births are marginally more dangerous for the baby for first-time mothers – although the risks are very small. Avoiding hospital also saves the NHS money. Figures show that a hospital birth costs £1,631, while it costs £1,450 for a midwife centre and £1,066 for a home birth. However, NICE stressed that new evidence on risk – and not cost – was the reason for the change. Professor Mark Baker, NICE’s clinical practice director, said: ‘Most women are healthy and have straightforward pregnancies and births. Over the years, evidence has emerged which shows that, for this group of women, giving birth in a midwife-led unit instead of a traditional labour ward is a safe option. Mothers are being warned that falling asleep with their babies while breastfeeding in bed is linked to cot death. The health watchdog NICE says it increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), although it stopped short of telling women not to sleep with their newborns because it may interfere with breastfeeding. It said exhausted parents should not feel guilty if they find they have accidentally nodded off with the baby, but must be aware of the ‘association’ with SIDS. Experts are not clear what causes SIDS, previously known as cot death, but it may be due to suffocation, infection or genetics. Professor Mark Baker of NICE admitted it was a ‘confusing’ message, but added: ‘We’re not telling people not to co-sleep with their babies, we know that could get in the way with breastfeeding, but it’s better that parents should know and make their own judgments.’ ‘Research also shows that a home birth is generally safer than hospital for pregnant women at low risk of complications who have given birth before.’ Professor Susan Bewley, who drew up the guidelines, said birth was now ‘mostly’ safe but said there is no ‘one size fits all’ choice of location during labour. She added: ‘Some women may prefer to have their baby at home or in a midwife-led unit because they are generally safer – that is their right and they should be supported in that choice. ‘But if a woman would prefer to have her baby in a hospital because it makes her feel ‘safer’, that is also her right.’ NICE said that overall, giving birth at home or in midwife-led units was a far happier experience. However, women who are obese or have asthma, diabetes or epilepsy or who have had a previous difficult birth are urged to go to hospital. Midwives and GPs are now urged to spell out the options open to women and make it clear that hospitals are not necessarily safest. Professor Alan Cameron, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said there was now better emphasis on patient choice. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, added: ‘It is important that women feel able to make the choices that are right for them.’","Push towards small midwife-led units by NICE marks major policy shift .

"Busted: Branden Mattier, 22, was arrested when police say he accepted a fake check for $.2.2million from an undercover officer after filing a bogus claim with the Boston bombing victims' fund . A Boston man has been arrested after police say he used the name of an aunt who had been dead for more than a decade to try and claim about $2.2million from the Boston Marathon bomb victims fund. The Massachusetts Attorney General's office said Branden Mattier, 22, told the fund's administrators that his aunt, Onevia Bradley, lost both of her legs in the attack on April 15 when two improvised pressure cooker bombs exploded at the finish line, killing three people and injuring 264 others. But Miss Bradley the aunt had been dead for more than 10 years and Mattier was arrested at his home in Boston when an undercover police officer presented him with a fake check for $2.2million, prosecutors said. ‘Because every dollar was allocated to victims, he sought to take these funds away from real victims of the Marathon attack and from the thousands of people who had so generously given to help those who truly need it,’ Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement. Mattier, an aspiring rapper and self-described film maker, is being charged with attempted larceny and identity theft. He is expected to be arraigned Wednesday. The marathon bombing victims’ fund, called The One Fund, was established by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. It has so far brought in more than $62million in donations, according to its website. The fund is being managed by Kenneth Feinberg, an arbitration attorney who also oversaw compensation for victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado. Brazen: Mattier posted this photo online of himself posing with an administrator from The One Fund, accompanied by the caption: 'Just spoke with Feinberg about what we can provide to help the city move forward in this tragedy, he loved it.' Big scam: Mattier (left and right) allegedly told the fund that his aunt lost both of her legs in the April 15 attack, but as it turns out, the woman had been dead for more than 10 years . Aspiring rapper: Mattier (right), who goes by the stage name The Real Soulja Boy, now faces attempted larceny and identity theft charges . Coakley said The One Fund flagged Mattier’s claim because it appeared ‘a little unusual,’ and passed it on to her office earlier this month. According to a press release from the Attorney General's office, the investigation revealed that on May 7, Mattier attended a Town Hall meeting at the Boston Public Library on behalf of his supposedly injured aunt. Three weeks later, he followed up by sending an email to The One Fund asking if his aunt could make a claim as a double amputee if the amputation was expected to be performed in the future. 'In June, The One Fund received Mattier’s claim form along with a letter allegedly from the chief of trauma services at the Boston Medical Center affirming his aunt as a double amputee,' the release stated. 'The letter was dated May 2, a full 27 days before Mattier’s email.' Charity: The marathon bombing victims' fund, called The One Fund, was established by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to help the victims of the attack . Tragedy: Two improvised pressure cooker bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon April 15 , killing three people and injuring 264 others . According to officials, the letter from the hospital was a forgery, and that Mattier’s aunt was never treated there. Mattier, who goes by the stage name The Real Soulja Boy, posted a photo May 7 on his Instagram account of himself posing with an administrator from The One Fund, accompanied by the caption: 'Just spoke with Feinberg about what we can provide to help the city move forward in this tragedy, he loved it. #OneFundBoston #Boston #BostonMarathon [new inner city developments on the way.] 🙏 #ss' In another image uploaded that same day, Mattier is seen holding paperwork at the offices of The One Found.

"Tragic loss: Robert Ethan Saylor, 26, of New Market, Md., died of asphyxia on January 12, 2013, after three Frederick County Sheriff's deputies tried to forcibly remove him from a movie theater at the manager's request . A health aide to a man with Down syndrome who died after being dragged from a Maryland theater had warned police that he would ‘freak out’ if they touched or spoke to him, according to an investigative file released Monday. Robert ‘Ethan’ Saylor, 26, passed away from asphyxia minutes later, after three Frederick County Sheriff's deputies handcuffed the flailing, 294-pound man as he screamed, cursed and cried for his mother, witnesses say. Saylor's offense, according to the file documents: He had not purchased a ticket for a repeat viewing of the movie Zero Dark Thirty. The 98-page incident report and handwritten statements from 22 witnesses add new details to a case that remains in the spotlight six months after Saylor's death on January 12. Critics continue to call for an independent investigation of the deputies' actions after a grand jury's decision in March not to indict them for what the state medical examiner's office has ruled a homicide. The 18-year-old caretaker, whose name is redacted from the documents, wrote that she had been Saylor's aide for three months before he died. She said Saylor, known to his family as Ethan, had a history of angry outbursts, including one earlier that night. They had already seen the movie once and were outside the Frederick theater when she asked Saylor if he was ready to go home. Saylor began cursing and punched a Lenscrafters storefront window, she told police. Somewhat frightened, the caretaker called Saylor's mother, 55-year-old Patti Saylor, of New Market. ‘Patti told her to just wait him out and his attitude will change,’ an investigator wrote in a follow-up interview report. No charges: A grand jury ruled in March that the three Maryland Sheriff's deputies involved in the death of Ethan Saylor, left, at a Westview movie theater, right, will not face criminal charges . The caretaker then spoke by phone with . another of Saylor's caretakers. He advised her to leave Saylor in front . of the theater while she got the car, giving him a few minutes alone to . calm himself. But by the . time she returned, Saylor had gone back into the theater and seated . himself. As she walked in, the manager of the cinema was telling Saylor . he had to either purchase a ticket to watch the film again, or leave the . auditorium. In response, the 26-year-old man said he had no money for another viewing. ‘I . explained, “Yes, we are having a little issue, I'll handle it. We just . have to be patient,""’ the caretaker wrote in her statement. The . manager then summoned one of the three deputies, Sgt. Rich Rochford. All of the deputies were moonlighting as mall security officers. ‘Then . a sheriff came and said, “Another show is starting. I have to go get . him out,""’ the caretaker wrote. ‘I explained Ethan is Down syndrome.’ She said she told the officer that if he spoke to Saylor, ‘he will curse.’ She advised him to ‘wait it out.’ Full life: With an IQ of 40, Ethan loved music, idolized law enforcement and was encouraged by his family to be independent . Justice for Ethan: The 26-year-old man's family, including brother Adam (left) and sister Emma (right), are calling for an independent probe into their sibling's untimely death . ‘Then the sheriff went in and started talking to Ethan and Ethan was cursing at him,’ the woman stated. She said the officer threatened to take Mr Saylor to jail, a statement corroborated by other witnesses. ‘I . then said, “Please don't touch him, he will freak out,""’ the aide . wrote. ‘Next thing I know, there are I think three or four cops holding . Ethan, trying to put him in handcuffs.’ As the officers pulled the struggling Saylor from his seat and down an exit ramp, they went down out of view of most witnesses. One . customer told police an officer had his knee on Saylor's lower back . while the other deputies held Saylor's shoulders. At least two witnesses . said the kneeling officer's knee was on the floor. Nobody reported . seeing the officers touch Saylor's neck. 'Mommy!' a witness later reported hearing Saylor cry out while struggling with the deputies. ‘It hurt [sic], call my mom.' Another . witness wrote in his statement that the 26-year-old could be heard . ‘squalling’ and repeatedly saying ‘no’ as the officers wrestled with . him, one of them even reading him his Miranda rights, the Washington Post reported. Neither . Saylor nor his 18-year-old health aide knew that Patti Saylor was just . five minutes away from the theater. But she arrived too late. Witness accounts: Theater goers who were present during the incident reported hearing Ethan cry for his mother and struggle with the officers . Saylor . became unconscious, so the deputies rolled him over, by all accounts. The deputies couldn't find a pulse, so they removed the handcuffs and . started chest compressions until he started breathing again, snoring but . unconscious, according to all accounts. They asked the caretaker if she could wake him. ‘I tapped him and said, “Wake up, Ethan,""’ she wrote. Mr Saylor never regained consciousness, despite the efforts of ambulance workers who arrived soon afterward. The . state medical examiner's office found signs of ‘positional’ asphyxia, . or having been in a position in which he couldn't breathe. There was . also unexplained damage to Saylor's larynx. The . autopsy concluded Saylor would not have died had the officers not . intervened. The autopsy also found that Saylor's developmental . disability, obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a heart . abnormality contributed to the death. According . to Ethan's mother and siblings, 21-year-old brother Adam and . 23-year-old sister Emma, the 26-year-old idolized law enforcement and . amassed a large collection of badges and baseball caps with words like . 'police' and 'sheriff' emblazoned across the front. Despite . having an IQ of 40, his mother, a nurse with special education degree, . had always encouraged Ethan to be independent and go places with his . aides. In a message posted Wednesday on the Facebook account Justice for Ethan, Patti Saylor wrote that even as her son was . being dragged to his death by police, he was on his cell phone trying to . arrange for a movie ticket purchase or for someone to bring him . money. Music-lover: Robert Saylor pictured with a relative was a big music fan and a member of his church choir . 'No one took the . time to understand this and he did not have the capacity to explain this . with words,' the 55-year-old nurse wrote. 'No one ever asked what he . might have been doing to address the need for a ticket when he didn't . have his own money!' Mrs . Saylor has renewed calls for an independent investigation into the death . of her son, calling the official probe conducted by the sheriff's . department a 'travesty.' In March, State's Attorney J. Charles . Smith announced that Lt. Scott Jewell, Sgt. Rich Rochford and Deputy . First Class James Harris would not face criminal charges in Saylor's . death. Patrick McAndrew, a lawyer for the . three officers, said 'each one of these deputies is the consummate law . enforcement professional' and did what his training dictated. 'Those . involved have yet to acknowledge responsibility or admit his death so . easily could have been avoided with common sense, patience and . understanding,' Patti Saylor stated in her post this week. In February, the Baltimore County . Medical Examiner's office declared that 26-year-old Robert Saylor died . by homicide while being taken into custody by the three officers, ABC News reported. The New Market man, remembered for his love of music, was handcuffed and allegedly resisted arrest. According . to ABC it was alleged his face was put to the ground when he was being . apprehended by the officers, who then realized he was suffering a . 'medical emergency'. The officers removed the handcuffs, administered first aid and took him to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he later died. 'Asphyxiation': Robert Saylor, pictured, was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital by police officers where he later died from his injuries . 'They made numerous attempts to get him to leave, he was cursing at them, at that point they psychically removed him, and he began having the medical emergency,' says Cpl. Jennifer Bailey, of the Frederick County Sheriff's Office told YourState4.com. 'Those . involved have yet to acknowledge responsibility or admit his death so . easily could have been avoided with common sense, patience and . understanding,' Patti Saylor stated in her post this week.","Robert Ethan Saylor, 26, died while being arrested for refusing to leave Westview Cinemas, Frederick, Maryland, on January 12 .

"Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has been made an honorary knight by the Queen. The 72-year-old businessman and politician's new title will be Michael Bloomberg, Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE). It comes just weeks after David Cameron was roundly criticised for breaking protocol by recounting a conversation he'd had with the Queen while chatting to the former Mayor of New York. The Prime Minister was overheard by a TV crew's microphone telling Mr Bloomberg that the Queen had 'purred' down the line when he informed her last month that Scotland had rejected independence. Sir Michael (sort of) : Businessman and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has been made a Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire . Billionaire Mr Bloomberg, who owns a £12million home in London's upmarket Knightsbridge and today said Britain was his 'second home', will not be travelling to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen, but said he was 'deeply honoured' by the award. He has been given the honorary knighthood for his 'prodigious entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavours, and the many ways in which they have benefited the United Kingdom and the UK-US special relationship', the British Embassy in Washington said in a statement. But the timing of the award may be regarded as somewhat unfortunate with Mr Cameron's gaffe still fresh in the memory. On a visit to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, Mr Cameron was overheard to tell Mr Bloomberg: 'She purred down the line. I've never heard someone so happy.' Embarrassed Mr Cameron apologised for the incident and his aides in Number 10 have been in touch with Buckingham Palace. But he has yet to apologise in person, and is expected to say sorry to the Queen at their next formal audience. 'Definition of relief': The moment before David Cameron told Bloomberg about the Queen 'purring down the line' Mr Bloomberg, a self-confessed anglophile, has committed £42.4m in philanthropic support to the UK . As a foreign national Mr Bloomberg will be made an honorary knight, and will therefore not be Sir Michael Bloomberg, but can, if he wishes, add KBE to the end of his name. Non-British nationals can receive honorary awards awards for their important contribution to British interests. 'As Mayor of New York, as a businessman, and as a philanthropist, Mike Bloomberg has played a key role in forging transatlantic diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties,' British Ambassador to the United States Sir Peter Westmacott said today. 'He has made a significant contribution to British business life through his firm, Bloomberg L.P., and the impact of his considerable philanthropic endeavours in the arts and education is felt by Britons every day.' Big fan: Bloomberg  will not be travelling to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen, but said he was 'deeply honored' to be awarded a knighthood . Upon accepting the title, Mr Bloomberg said: 'I am deeply honoured to receive this recognition, which is especially meaningful to me because of my close personal, business, and philanthropic ties to London and Britain, which stretch back four decades. 'Over those years it has been a great privilege to work with British leaders on a wide variety of issues, and to invest - commercially, culturally, and civically - in the future of Britain, a place I have long considered my second home.' As Mayor of New York, Mr Bloomberg got on famously well with London Mayor Boris Johnson the pair worked together to boost travel between the UK capital and NYC. Mr Bloomberg, a self-confessed anglophile, is a 'great supporter of the arts and education in Britain' and has committed more than £42.4million in philanthropic support to the UK. Other American citizens who have been made honorary knights include Steven Spielberg, George Bush Sr and Ronald Reagan.","Made Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire .

"Gerard Pique knows all about the glory of winning the Clasico, having scored in the famous 6-2 win for Barcelona in Madrid in 2009 and played in the 5-0 a year later when Jose Mourinho was humbled on his debut as a manager in the fixture. On Saturday he welcomes a new team-mate to the ‘greatest show on earth’: the high-wire artist Luis Suarez, capable of wowing the crowds, but also of falling from great heights as he did at the World Cup. ‘I don’t care if he bites,’ says Pique, speaking in English ahead of Saturday’s game. He immediately corrects himself. ‘I don’t care if he’s bitten before,’ he says. ‘He knows it’s not the correct way to behave but as a player he is in the top three or five strikers in the world so I am really happy to have him in my team.’ Pique knows Suarez will bring a toughness that has at times been missing from Barcelona’s make-up over the last two seasons. Barcelona's Gerard Pique (centre) jokes with Luis Suarez (left) and Lionel Messi (right) at training on Friday . Barcelona manager Luis Enrique (pictured, behind) confirmed Suarez is set to make his competitive debut . In 10 years of Clasicos Pique has seen tensions rise during the clashes between Barcelona and Real Madrid . ‘He is a different style of player for us. We have Andres Iniesta and Xavi and they are sweet players and you can enjoy watching them on the ball, it’s easy on the eye. Not with Suarez. He fights and scraps for the ball and finally gets the goal. In training you see that ultra-competitive streak. You can kick him and he just never goes down. You pull his shirt and he still goes towards the goal. It’s true that he had a reputation in England (for diving) but you fall once in the Premier League and it sticks. I have found him to be a very fair player.’ Pique has spent plenty of time up close and personal with the new man as Barcelona are put through their paces by Luis Enrique, the coach who is also preparing for his first clasico, as a manager at least. Pique, the joker, was never going to let last summer’s event pass without training-ground comment. ‘Of course we have been teasing him a little bit. Last week we had a defensive drill to practise dealing with crosses. He was the attacker and I had to defend against him and two or three times we were fighting to get to the ball first and I’d say, “Don’t bite me”. He just smiles.’ Those training drills have also reinforced just what a natural finisher Suarez is. ‘In training it’s unbelievable,’ says Pique. ‘He has got that instinct that means when there are two or three rebounds in the box, the ball will always end up at his feet and he’ll score.’ Suarez shared the Golden Boot last season with Cristiano Ronaldo, Pique’s former Manchester United team-mate whom he will face on Saturday and against whom he usually fares well. Pique admits that good record is in part owed to what were brilliant team performances as Barcelona reached near perfection under their greatest ever coach. Suarez has said biting is 'like an impulse' and that 'everyone has different ways of defending themselves' ‘In the first three or four years with Pep Guardiola I think we played the best football I can remember. And we took that into the games against Real Madrid,’ Pique says. ‘In the last two or three years it has been a little bit more difficult for us but now we have changed the mentality with Luis Enrique and we are pressing very high again and Suarez will definitely help that.’ To what extent the Uruguayan can help power Barcelona’s rediscovered high intensity after four months out will be tested on Saturday. ‘In those first few training sessions you could see that he needed to train because he was dead after 10 minutes of work,’ admits Pique. ‘I would turn around and look at him and say, “What happened to you, man?” But after two or three weeks he started to improve and now, as he showed against Oman in the last friendly for Uruguay, he is in good condition.’ The spotlight will also be on Pique on Saturday. He has been left out at times this season — something that has never happened since the days of waiting in vain for Rio Ferdinand or Nemanja Vidic to pick up an injury or suspension at United. The striker is set to make his competitive debut against Real Madrid on Saturday night after a four-month ban . The Uruguayan has also said that he is in now on the 'right path' after seeking help for his impulses to bite . Pique was a world champion with Spain and a European champion with Barcelona aged just 23. ‘It’s been a strange career having hit such incredible heights so soon. It’s not a strange career, it’s a very good career,’ he says. ‘And now here at Barcelona, it is the first time that I am not playing as much as I want to. It’s a big challenge.’ In 10 years of clasicos he has seen tensions rise during the clashes between Guardiola and Jose Mourinho, and fall since their departure. ‘To be fair I really kind of enjoyed it,’ Pique says. ‘It is true that maybe sometimes they crossed the line. And we crossed the line, too. It is just a game. But it is fine if you know how to control your emotions and everything on the pitch stays on the pitch and after the game you still have the same friendships.’ It somewhat underlines his point that former Real Madrid player Xabi Alonso now plays for Guardiola and former Barcelona team-mate Cesc Fabregas now plays for Mourinho. ‘It’s football. One day you say you hate someone and the next day you’re playing for them,’ says Pique. ‘We have a career and we always have to try to make the best of it. Fabregas loves London and so he went to Chelsea and Mourinho was there and Mourinho likes him so he said, “OK, I will play there”.’ Pique almost says that Fabregas loves Mourinho too but the old allegiances seem to prevent him getting the whole sentence out. ‘He loves Mo . . . well, I don’t know if he loves Mourinho but I think he does because he’s putting him in the team all the time and here at Barcelona it was more difficult for him,’ he says. ‘You can see after two or three months there that he made the right decision.’ Would Pique follow Fabregas back to the Premier League if United came calling? ‘I left a lot of friends at United and I was really happy there even though I did not play as much as I wanted to,’ he says. ‘But I always said that I want to retire here and if it is possible I want to stay here all my career. At this moment I am not thinking about leaving. I am really happy if it is true that Manchester United want me but I want to stay. I have been a Barcelona fan since I was a kid and all I want to do is to have success here.’ Pique (right) has been sidelined on occasion this season — something of a rarity for the Barcelona defender . On the pitch he still believes he can reach the heights of four years ago and away from football he is thriving at the head of the small company Kerad Games that has recently extended its Golden Manager online football game to mobile platforms. The game is popular with his own team-mates and involves each player picking his own team — which begs the obvious question: who’s in your forward line, Gerard? ‘Leo and Cristiano for sure,’ he says. ‘And I had (Wayne) Rooney before but now . . . now it would have to be Suarez.’ l Sky Sports is showing more of the games that matter in an unrivalled schedule of football, including El Clasico and Man Utd v Chelsea this weekend.

"Brave: Dr Maria Santos Gorrostieta has been found beaten to death at the side of a road. She defied Mexico's powerful drug gangs and survived two assassination attempts, the first of which claimed the life of her husband . The woman mayor who was kidnapped and murdered by a Mexican drug gang pleaded with her attackers for her young daughter’s life, it emerged today. Maria Santos Gorrostieta, who had already survived two assassination attempts, was driving the child to school at around 8.30am when she was ambushed by a car in the city of Morelia. The 36-year-old was hauled from her vehicle and physically assaulted as horrified witnesses watched, according to newspaper El Universal.They described how she begged for her child to be left alone and then appeared to get into her abductors’ car willingly. The little girl was left wailing as her mother was driven away on Monday November 12. For the next week, her frantic family waited by the phone for a ransom call that never came.  Gorrostieta’s body – stabbed, burned, battered and bound at wrist and ankle – would finally be found eight days on dumped by a roadside in San Juan Tararameo, Cuitzeo Township. She left behind her daughter and two sons as well as her second husband Nereo Delgado Patinoran. Hailed as a heroine of the 21st century, her death has prompted much soul-searching in a country ravaged by violence. The decision to withdraw her security team in November last year – and her police escort in January – has come under particular scrutiny.Gorrostieta was elected as mayor of Tiquicheo, a rural district in Michoacan, west of Mexico City, in 2008. Almost immediately, she received threats. The first assassination attempt came in October 2009 when the car she was travelling in with her first husband Jose Sanchez came under fire from gunmen in the town of El Limone. The attack claimed his life but Gorrostieta lived. She battled back from her injuries in the face of overwhelming tragedy, but she was not destined to know peace. The next attempt on her life was just three months later, when an masked group carrying assault rifles ambushed her on the road between Michoacan and Guerreo state. The van she was traveling in was peppered by 30 bullets. Three hit her. This time her wounds were more severe, leaving multiple scars and forcing her to wear a colostomy bag. She was left in constant pain. But with unimaginable courage – and despite being a marked woman – she remained defiant to the very end. Murder: The corpse of Dr Gorrostieta, found by farm workers from San Juan Tararameo. She had been burned, beaten and stabbed . Scene of the crime: Cuitzeo Township, close to where her corpse was discovered and Morelia, where she was kidnapped . When some doubted that she had been shot, Gorrostieta bared the scars that riddled her flesh and swore she would never give in. In a statement to the public made at the time, the devout Catholic said: 'At another stage in my life, perhaps I would have resigned from what I have, my position, my responsibilities as the leader of my Tiquicheo. 'But today, no. It is not possible for me to surrender when I have three children , whom I have to educate by setting an example, and also because of the memory of the man of my life, the father of my three little ones, the one who was able to teach me the value of things and to fight for them. 'Although he is no longer with us, he continues to be the light that guides my decisions.' She added: 'I struggle day to day to erase from my mind the images of the horror I lived, and that others who did not deserve or expect it also suffered. Grim discovery: Residents of the community of San Juan Tararameo found her body as they went to work in the fields . 'I wanted to show them my wounded, mutilated, humiliated body, because I’m not ashamed of it, because it is the product of the great misfortunes that have scarred my life, that of my children and my family.' 'Despite my own safety and that of my family, what occupies my mind is my responsibility towards my people, the children, the women, the elderly and the men who break their souls every day without rest to find a piece of bread for their children. 'Freedom brings with it responsibilities and I don’t dare fall behind. My long road is not yet finished - the footprint that we leave behind in our country depends on the battle that we lose and the loyalty we put into it.' After her ordeal she remarried and ran for a seat in Mexico's Congress of the Union, but failed to gain the backing she needed. She remarried and dropped out of the public eye. But it was still almost inevitable that she would eventually pay for her bravery with her life . Mexico has been torn apart by murderous drug gangs since President Felipe Calderon launched his drug offensive in 2006. More than 50,000 people have been killed in clashes between rival drug cartels and security forces and about two dozen mayors have been murdered. The cartels have ruled the streets with fear for years, enforcing their authority with murders, bribery and torture. But after decades of using force to combat the gangs, it is U.S. lawmakers who are the criminals' biggest problem. Legalisation of marijuana, as recently voted for by Colorado and Washington states, may wipe billions of dollars from the cartels’ annual profits. And it has left politicians in Mexico with a tough question: How can they continue to justify spending money – and lives – fighting drug distribution to America when it will be legal in some states from next month? Sickening: Dr Gorrostieta shows the wounds she sustained from the ambushers' gunfire and the subsequent car crash . Wounds: The ex-mayor was lucky to survive the second attack. She was left in constant pain and was forced to use a colostomy bag . Mexico presidential advisor Luis . Videgaray said in a radio interview last week: 'Obviously, we can’t . handle a product that is illegal in Mexico, trying to stop its transfer . to the United States, when in the United States, at least in part of the . United States, it now has a different status' From January to September last year, . 12,903 people were killed in the country in drug-related crime, ranging . from gang members, Mexican military and innocent victims caught up in . gun battles. The Mexican government claim they are winning the war on drugs, but few outside – or inside – the country believe that. So corrupt are their police that they . are rarely employed in combating the cartels. Instead, the country . relies on its army to tackle the gangs while it attempts to rebuild its . police forces. Public support for the drug war continues to fall as the death toll rises and the cartels’ profits rise. The business of trafficking drugs . from Mexico into the U.S. is estimated to be a business worth between . $13billion (£8billion) and $49billion (£30billion), with 90 per cent of . all cocaine used in America originating from the country, according to a . U.S. state report. Icon: Maria was described by a prominent Mexican journalist as 'a heroine of the 21st century' Casualty of war: Dr Gorrostieta is the latest official murdered by cartels in Mexico's bloody battle over drugs . The U.S. Justice Department considers . the cartels as America’s greatest organised crime threat, while . conceding that it is U.S. dollars that fund the crime ravaging Mexico. In 2009 a military assessment . predicted that if the drugs war continued for another 25 years, Mexico’s . government was at serious risk of collapse and the conflict would . spread into America. A year earlier, the U.S. Joint Forces . Command suggested a similar time-scale of collapse in Mexico and warned . American intervention may be necessary due to the implications for . homeland security. The problem of strengthening the . Mexico/U.S. border even prompted President Barack Obama to deploy 1,200 . National Guard troops in 2010. The two major cartels in Mexico are now the Sinaloa Cartel and Los Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel was formed when several gangs agreed to join forces in 2006 and is now led by Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. He is Mexico's most wanted drug . trafficker and is believed to be worth $1billion. Forbes magazing even . declared him the 55th most powerful man in the world in 2009. Los Zetas were originally a mercenary outfit of former elite members of the Mexican army by the Gulf Cartel. Consisting of Airmobile Special . Forces Group and Amphibian Group of Special Forces members, they helped . control parts of Mexico for the Gulf Cartel until its leader, Osiel . Cardenas Guillen, was arrested. Los Zetas took the opportunity to . seize power for themselves and are now a 300-strong independent drugs . and arms trafficking gang under the leadership of Heriberto Lazcano. Gorrostieta was born in 1976 and graduated in medicine from a university in the city of Morelia. She was elected mayor of Tiquicheo in 2008 and served until 2011. During that time she defected from the Institutional Revolutionary party to the left-wing Democratic Revolution party. In January 2009 her husband Jose Sanchez Chavez was set upon by an armed group but escaped . In October that year Maria was attacked while she was with her husband as they drove along in El Limone. Jose died that day from gunshot wounds. Maria survived but was taken to a hospital in Morelia, the state capital. On January 23, 2010, she was attacked by men with machine guns in Ciudad Altamirano Guerrero, on her way to an event at the City Hall. She was severely injured after being hit by three bullets, as well as receiving wounds in the crash after the shooting, and had to use a colostomy bag. She said her wounds left her in constant pain. On Saturday November 17 her body was found by farm workers from San Juan Tararameo, Cuitzeo Township, who were heading to work. She was discovered on the property known as El Chupadero. The next day she was identified by members of her family.","Maria Santos Gorrostieta had been stabbed, beaten and burned .

"New York city police say a uniformed officer shot and killed an 86-year-old man after he refused to drop his gun. They say the gunman, later identified as Jack Calvello, may have shot a woman before police arrived at the scene at 31-28 38th Street in Astoria, Queens today. Police say a 911 call came in at 11:16 a.m., and the caller said he had shot his daughter. Jack Calvello, 86, was shot dead by police late this morning after he allegedly shot his daughter and his dog at his Astoria home (pictured) Officers found a man armed with a gun and the man refused an order to drop his weapon, then pointed his gun at the officers; one of the officers then shot him. The 86-year-old gunman Calvello, who was also deaf, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Witnesses Bryan Garcia and Eric Soto were playing basketball across the street and saw the bloody crime unveil before their eyes. '(Cops) were yelling 'Get out, get out!' and then he comes out with a gun, pointing at them. They said 'Drop it, drop it!' loud, and he doesn't, so then we heard two shots, and he falls back into the doorway,"" Garcia said. 'It looked like they hit him in the chest, he fell straight back,'he told The New York Daily News. Garcia also said that the gun appeared to be a double barreled shotgun. Soto, 15, said he and Garcia were just 10 feet away from the shooting and close enough to see the bright flash from the cops' gun blasts. 'When they shot him, it made us shake,' Soto said. 'At that point we covered our heads and ran, we were terrified.' 'That was the first time we've seen someone die, so it was terrifying,' Garcia added. Officers from the 114th Precinct responded to a family dispute with a firearm at 31-28 38th Street (pictured here) in Astoria . A 65-year-old woman was found inside the house with a gunshot wound at her head. She is in critical condition at another hospital. Neighbors identified that gunman as Jack Cavello, a deaf man who wore a hearing aid and lived on the block for years. A police source told the New York Daily News that the dog was a brown Yorkshire terrier. It suffered a laceration to the neck but is expected to live. A man who owns a business in the neighborhood where Calvello lived said that Calvello shared the two story home and scene of the crime with his wife and his daughter. 'I didn't know of any problems he had with his family. If he did, he never said anything to me, the man who wished not to be named said of Calvello. 'He told me a while ago that he had a gun, but he didn't talk about it much. He tried to sell the gun to a pawn shop about a year ago.' Dean Rocco, 29, who works at Astoria Home Reality close to the incident said that Calvello seemed normal. 'I know the guy, everyone in the neighborhood knows him...He seemed like a normal guy, I see him going to the supermarket.' The female victim's name has not yet been released.","Police say the gunman who allegedly shot his daughter and dog, later identified as Jack Calvello, refused to drop his gun .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has asked Andy Carroll to curb his 'fearless' approach as the England striker hopes to return from long-term injury on Saturday. The 25-year-old could be on the bench for the home tie with Aston Villa and see what would be his first competitive action since injuring ankle ligaments on a pre-season tour of New Zealand.

'The romance has blossomed to the point where he feels that she feels that they want a long-term relationship, and I always think that can be very good for a footballer when they settle down more off the field. 'London can be a very lonely city if you are sat in your apartment on your own every single night - maybe you stay out that little bit too late.

"If you've ever wondered how close London’s landmarks came to being blown up in the Blitz, a new interactive map has the answer. The Bomb Sight project allows people to zoom in on a map of the capital to see the damage inflicted during the heaviest period of bombing by German planes. It was created by a collaboration . between Dr Catherine Jones of the University of Portsmouth and the The . National Archives, and funded by the charity JISC. Try the interactive map below . The site can tell people exactly when their area was hit, and even show photos from the period. 'The Bomb Sight project is mapping the London WW2 bomb census between 7/10/1940 and 06/06/1941,' the team say on their site. 'Previously available only by viewing in the Reading Room at The . National Archives, Bomb Sight is making the maps available to citizen . researchers, academics and students wanting to explore where the bombs . fell and to discover memories and photographs from the period. The project has scanned original 1940s bomb census maps, geo-referenced the maps to add their exact location. The . team then digitally captured the geographical locations of all the . falling bombs recorded on the original map, and created an easy to use . website and app to display it. 'We have combined the location of each of the falling bombs over an 8 . month period of the London Blitz together with geo-located photographs . from the Imperial War Museum and Geo-located Memories from the BBC WW2 .

'You can explore statistics for different areas and see how many bombs fell in different wards and boroughs in London as well as read memories of Londoners contributed to the BBC WW2 People's War and images from the Imperial War Museum to allow you to visualise what it was like in London at such a difficult time.' The team has also created an augmented reality version for Android mobile phones that uses GPS to pinpoint the user. Tourists can simply point their phone at an area to see if it was bombed, and if it was, find out more. The team has also created a mobile phone version that overlays bomb information onto a live video feed taken from the phone's camera, and using GPS to pinpoint the location.

Deeply-buried shelters provided the most protection against a direct hit, although the government in 1939 refused to allow tube stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel. However, by the second week of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened.

"Tragic: David Silva, pictured, was allegedly beaten to death by sheriff's deputies on Wednesday . A shocking video has captured the moment a father-of-four was savagely beaten to death by a group of sheriff's deputies who found him passed out in a Bakersfield, California, street. The explosive footage comes as the Kern County sheriff's department is accused of trying to cover up the alleged murder of David Silva, 33, apparently seizing cell phones of witnesses who filmed the horrifying incident. Family members aren't sure why Silva came to be intoxicated, sleeping in the road opposite Kern Medical Center last Tuesday night, though he had told his mother earlier that evening he was having 'personal issues.' A . statement from the sheriff's department said a deputy and K9 were sent . to the area . after someone reported a possibly intoxicated man. The deputy called for backup and another seven officers plus two members of the California Highway Patrol showed up. The statement said Silva resisted when the . deputies tried to restrain him, forcing them to use their batons on him. However, multiple witnesses, many of whom filmed the violent scene unfolding, claim the attack was completely unprovoked. Sulina Quair, 34, called 911 and can be heard saying: 'There's a man laying on the floor, and your police officers beat the **** out of him and killed him... 'I got it all on video camera and I'm sending it to the news. These cops have no reason to do this to this man. You've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 sheriffs. The guy was laying on the floor and eight sheriffs ran up and started beating him up with sticks. The man is dead, laying here right here, right now.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Beatings: The dark footage, captured left and right, shows the man laying on the street being beaten repeatedly with batons . Injustice: The explosive footage comes as the Kern County sheriff's department is accused of trying to cover up the alleged murder of David Silva, 33, pictured with tree of his children . Another witness, Ruben Ceballos, 19, . said in a Monday interview he was woken up by the sounds of police . batons cracking Silva's head. 'I saw two sheriff's deputies on top of this guy, just beating him,' Ceballos told the LA Times. 'He was screaming in pain... asking for help. He was incapable of . fighting back – he was outnumbered, on the ground. They just beat him . up.' Sheriff's . investigators later seized cellphones from witnesses and in two cases . witnesses were detained for hours until they agreed to hand over their . phones, according to David Cohn, a lawyer for Silva's devastated family. 'It makes it look like a coverup,' Cohn told the Times. 'What we're all concerned about is, ""Are these . videos going to be altered? Are they going to be deleted?""' The . latest footage was supplied to 23 ABC News on the condition of . anonymity. It is grainy and dark but shows the outline of men using . batons to brutally beat another man laying in the street. Sheriff Donny Youngblood told the newspaper it was too early to reach any conclusions about Silva's death. But he said the deputies' decision to confiscate the phones was the right thing to do. Crime scene: Silva was beaten by police on a street in Bakersfield, pictured . 'We still have to secure the . evidence, especially when the evidence can tell us whether we did it . right or wrong,' Youngblood said. A . statement from the sheriff's department said a deputy and K9 were sent . to an area across from the Kent Medical Center at 11:55 p.m. on Tuesday . on reports of a possibly intoxicated man. They . said Silva resisted when the . deputies tried to restrain him, forcing them to use their batons on him. The statement said Silva stopped breathing and was taken to the . hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The police department identified seven deputies involved in Silva's arrest as Sgt. Douglas Sword, Deputy Ryan Greer, Deputy Tanner Miller, Deputy Jeffrey Kelly, Deputy Luis Almanza, Deputy Brian Brock, and Deputy David Stephens. Two California Highway Patrol officers also responded, though they haven't been identified. All officers are still working, something which has outraged Silva's family. On Monday, CHP spokesman Robert Rodriguez told KBAK/KBFX Eyewitness News that the car that arrived on the scene got dashboard camera video of the incident but he said he was unable to reveal what that video captured. Rodriguez said the footage has been turned over to the sheriff's department. Silva's brother Chris Silva said it 'hurt his head' to watch the disturbing video, given to him by the witness who captured it. Family man: David Silva, pictured with his family, was pronounced dead just after midnight after the alleged attack . Unprovoked: Witnesses said the man, pictured right, was laying on the ground and at no point provoked officers . 'Constant bashing, this is constant bashing,' Chris Silva told Eyewitness News. 'You can count, you know -- I can't keep track. And it hurts my heart looking at this.' The incident took place across the road from Kern Medical Center. Chris Silva told Eyewitness News . that it wasn't clear why David Silva was at KMC, but they . believe he went there because he needed help.

While the video is dark and captured at a distance, Chris Silva has labeled it a 'gift' and hopes it will help get the truth out about what happened to his brother. 'Are we rushing to conclusions or judgment?' he said. 'No, we're just trying to get the truth told. I just want people to ask why? And the question is, why did my brother have to die?' He added: 'I'll do anything to get that story out, and I'll do anything to make sure this wouldn't happen again to anybody.'","Witnesses say Kern County Sheriff's deputies repeatedly struck David Silva, 33, with their batons in an unprovoked attack as he lay passed out on the ground  in Bakersfield, California .

"An off-duty police officer who allegedly hit and killed a teenager while driving drunk was initially worried about the damage to his car, according to tapes of him talking to himself in his squad car. After Richard Bolling was stopped having apparently fled the scene of the accident in Chicago, he initially exclaimed: 'Look at my car. Oh man, look at my car.' But when he was told that 13-year-old Trenton Booker had died, he howled, 'No, no, no, no, no!' The recordings were played yesterday at his trial, where he denies aggravated DUI, reckless homicide and leaving the scene of a fatal accident. Trial: Off-duty police officer Richard Bolling, left, is accused of killing 13-year-old Trenton Booker, right, while driving drunk . Bolling, 42, was driving home from a bar in May 2009 when he ran over Booker, who was cycling with a friend. He was stopped by his police colleagues driving down the wrong side of the road a few blocks away from the scene and found to have an open bottle of beer in his car, according to police reports. The audio recordings made by a microphone in the car and played at Bolling's trial show what was going through his mind after he was stopped. 'Oh Lord, Richard, what is wrong with you man?' he said to himself before expressing concern at the state of his car, whose windshield was cracked and spattered with blood. He then jokingly pretended to worry about cops eating his fast food, saying: 'Don't you eat my White Castles up. Don't you do that - I'm hungry.' But his tone suddenly changed when the officers who had arrested him told him that Booker was dead. 'Oh no! Please don't tell me that man,' he cried. 'Oh my God. No, no, no, no, no!' Booker's parents walked out of court while the recordings of their son's alleged killer were being played. Crash: Bolling allegedly ran over Booker's bike with his squad car in May 2009 . Destruction: Booker's mangled bike after the accident in Chicago . The trial also heard testimony yesterday from Milton Kinnison, the rookie officer who arrested Bolling. 'My opinion is that he was under the influence of alcohol,' said Mr Kinnison - even though at the time he determined that Bolling was sober after he asked him to walk nine steps then pivot and turn. He now says that the suspect walked ten steps, could not turn properly and had to use his arms for balance. Bolling twice refused to take a breathalyser test, acording to Mr Kinnison, and when he did take a test four and a half hours after the accident he was just under the legal driving limit. Prosecutors have hinted that Bolling was given special treatment after his arrest. He was driven to a gas station and allowed to use the bathroom before taking a sobriety test, which Mr Kinnison confirmed yesterday was not normal procedure. And a superior officer allegedly told Bolling he would 'try to help you out as much as possible'. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","'No, no, no, no, no!' Richard Bolling cried when told 13-year-old he hit was dead ."
"A Saudi man convicted of paralysing his best friend in a knife attack is being threatened with having his spinal cord cut in a tit-for-tat punishment. The ultra-conservative desert Kingdom enforces Islamic law and on rare occasions issues punishments based on the ancient code of an ‘eye-for-an-eye’. Ali Al-Khawahir was 14 years old when he stabbed his friend in the backbone and has been imprisoned for 10 years. Despite the rash of ultra-modern buildings Saudi Arabia remains a deeply traditional country. The desert Kingdom follows Islamic law and some sentences still follow the ancient code of an 'eye-for-an-eye' He has been told that he will be sentenced to being fully paralysed himself unless he pays the victim blood money in a form of compensation, reported the Saudi Gazette. Originally the victim requested 2 million Saudi Riyal - more than half a million U.S. dollars - but it was later reduced to 1 million. His mother has begged people to contribute money to the fund. 'Ten years have passed with hundreds of sleepless nights. My hair has become grey at a young age because of my son’s problem. 'I have been frightened to death whenever I think about my son’s fate and that he will have to be paralyzed,' she said. Saudi . Arabia enforces strict Islamic law and occasionally doles out . punishments based on the ancient legal code of an eye for an eye. Punishment: Ali Al-Khawahir was 14-years-old when he stabbed his friend in the backbone and has been imprisoned for 10 years . In 2010, Abdul-Aziz al-Mutairi, 22, was left paralysed and subsequently lost a foot after a fight more than two years ago. He asked a judge in north-western Tabuk province to impose an equivalent punishment on his attacker, his brother Khaled al-Mutairi told The Associated Press. Such ‘eye for eye’ punishments are rarely carried out in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi reformists are infuriated when such sentences are passed. Seven years ago a Saudi court pardoned an Indian man, Abdul Lateef Noushad, whose eye was to be gouged out. He had blinded another man in a fight over money. The victim eventually pardoned the Indian after the case threatened to cause a diplomatic row. The reprieve came a day before Saudi’s King Abdullah arrived in India on a state visit. But 13 years ago, an Egyptian worker had an eye surgically removed in a Saudi hospital as punishment for disfiguring a compatriot in an acid attack six years earlier. That was said to be the first time in 40 years that a Saudi court had applied literally the principle of 'an eye for an eye', local media said at the time. King Abdullah, the Saudi monarch, insists he has been trying to clamp down on extremist ideology . The Egyptian’s victim had refused a blood money offer of £87,000. In 2008, an Iranian court sentenced a man to be blinded with acid after he did the same to a woman he was stalking. It is not clear if the punishment was carried out. Human rights groups invariably describe such ‘eye for an eye’ punishments as 'abhorrent'. They also say that trials in Saudi Arabia fall far below international standards. Trials usually take place behind closed doors and without adequate legal representation. The Kingdom has one of the highest execution rates in the world after China and Iran. The most common method of execution in Saudi Arabia is beheading. The sentences are usually carried out in public. But King Abdullah, the Saudi monarch, insists he has been trying to clamp down on extremist ideology and improve the country’s forbidding image. Last week Saudi authorities beheaded a murderer and crucified his body after he killed and raped a Pakistani national. The kingdom's interior ministry announced the execution, stating that the man had murdered and sodomised another male. Both actions are punishable by death. 'The Yemeni citizen Mohammed Rashad Khairi Hussain killed a Pakistani, Pashteh Sayed Khan, after he committed sodomy with him,' said a statement carried by state news agency SPA. Hussain was also convicted of robbery and carrying out a series of attacks. The execution, in the southern city of Jizan, was followed by crucifixion, a punishment used by the ultra-conservative country for serious crimes. Saudi Arabia have been criticised in the international community for its harsh punishments, including executions by beheading and firing squad. There have been 28 people beheaded in Saudi Arabia this year. In 2012, they executed 76 people, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, while the US-based Human Rights Watch put the number at 69.","Ali Al-Khawahir was aged 14 when he stabbed his friend in the backbone .

"A plane spotter has captured the nerve-wracking moment an easyJet flight was forced to abort its landing as strong winds battered Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. In the 90-second video, the Airbus A319 appears to be fine as it rapidly approaches the runway but at the last second it suddenly tilts sharply to the right. The aircraft’s rear right wheels briefly touch down as the plane is whipped by powerful wind gusts. An easyJet flight's aborted landing was captured on camera by a plane spotter at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport . The aircraft's rear right wheels briefly touch down on the runway as the plane is rocky by strong winds . That’s when the plane suddenly pulls up and soars back into the dark skies over the airport to attempt another landing. The video shows the Airbus A319 landing safely on its second attempt several minutes later. The clip has had over 30,000 views since it was uploaded to YouTube over the weekend by a plane spotter known online as Schipholhotspot. He wrote: ‘This second approach is still difficult because the conditions have not changed much in the time it took the plane to go around.’ easyJet says it was 'a routine go-around procedure' and passengers and crew were not in danger . The Airbus A319 approaches the runway a second time after the first attempt was scrapped . The 90-second video shows the plane landing safely on its second attempt several minutes later .

She said: ‘easyJet can confirm that this aircraft is performing a routine go-around procedure – at no point was the safety of the passengers and crew compromised. ‘Our pilots are highly trained to perform “go arounds” as a precaution and in line with our procedures. ‘The safety of its passengers and crew is the airline’s highest priority.’ The spokeswoman for the Luton-based airline said she was unaware of the flight's origin and the number of passengers and crew on board because go arounds are a routine procedure and are not required to be recorded.","Rear right wheels touch down as plane is whipped by strong winds .

"The Queen will have to pay the mansion tax on her homes worth more than £2million . The Royals will not be excluded from the ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth more than £2million, Ed Balls revealed today. The Shadow Chancellor said the party’s proposed levy on expensive homes would ‘rightly’ apply to the Queen as much as anyone else. Labour sources insisted the tax would not hit homes which were open to the public – meaning Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle would be exempt. But the Queen’s private Balmoral and Sandringham estates would not escape the levy. Under proposals backed by Labour and the Lib Dems, new council tax bands would be introduced to hit homes worth more than £2million. A Labour source said people will have to declare if they are liable for the tax - like companies which own properties have to now. He said: ‘The Royal family pay council tax like everyone else.' Mr Balls said the tax – which will be used to fund extra doctors and nurses in the NHS – could not be applied to some people but not to others. Speaking to Sky News’ Murnaghan programme this morning, Mr Balls said: 'There has always been a cross-party consensus that we have fair and tough rules for the financing of the Royal Household but members of the Royal Household pay taxes just like everybody else and rightly so. ‘There aren't different rules for anybody. That's the nature of our society.’ He also confirmed that home owners would have to own up to the value of their homes. Mr Balls’ remarks came after Nick Clegg – speaking in Glasgow at the Lib Dem conference – said he would increase taxes if the party was still in government after the next election. Asked if the Lib Dems would raise taxes, he said: ‘Yes, of course. We must raise taxes.’ The Queen's private Sandringham estate in Norfolk will not be exempt from the tax, because it is not open to the public . The Royals face paying tens of thousands of pounds in tax each year on its Aberdeenshire Balmoral estate . Buckingham Palace, the Queen's official residence, would be exempt from the mansion tax because it is open to the public . Mr Clegg said the proposed ‘mansion tax’ was among a series of tax reforms proposed by the Lib Dems that would help fill the deficit black hole. In an interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show he accused the Conservatives of announcing with ‘almost undisguised relish’ that they would not ask the wealthiest to pay a ‘single penny towards completing the deficit reduction effort’. The Lib Dem leader said that trying to clear the deficit without raising taxes was ‘economically extreme’.","Mr Balls said party's proposed levy would 'rightly' apply to the Royal Family .

"After serving in the battlegrounds of Afghanistan, hardened soldier Hannah Winterbourne has revealed herself as the British Army’s first transgender officer. As a captain in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, she is the Army’s most highly ranked transgender soldier and the only one to become an officer. The 27-year-old was born a boy and spent her first few years in the Army as a man, before deciding to undergo a sex-change operation while on a tour of duty at Camp Bastion. British Army officer Hannah Winterbourne (left) was born a boy and spent time in the Army as a man (right). The 27-year-old decided while on duty in Afghanistan that she wanted to undergo a sex-change operation . The officer – who has chosen not to reveal her original name because it’s a ‘label’ from her past - is now one year off her full transformation after beginning hormone therapy, having some surgery and a beard removed . She said sharing a tent in the desert with seven men ‘living on top of each other’ made her realise how little time she spent being herself. ‘In Afghanistan I was living an act, I was acting for everyone around me,’ she said. ‘There was no let-up where I could stop the act. Previously, I relished my own time where I could be honest with myself. ‘In Afghanistan I couldn’t do that so that was a nudge which eventually ended up with me coming out and changing myself and my way of life.’ The officer – who has chosen not to reveal her original name because it’s a ‘label’ from her past – said she faced a battle with herself from an early age. She told The Sun: ‘As early as I can remember there were feelings that were not what you expect. ‘But as a very young person I could not pinpoint the fact that I felt that I was a girl. ‘Society says to you that young boys play with trucks and wear blue and I just never really fell into that category…As I got older those feelings became more solidified, then around the age of puberty you begin to understand a little more about gender. 'That’s when … I thought “this is wrong for me, I’m actually female”.’ She said sharing a tent in the desert with seven men ‘living on top of each other’ made her realise how little time she spent being herself and said she was 'living an act'. She had the operation upon her return to the UK . She said her parents and colleagues have been ‘tremendously supportive’ of her sex-change transformation . She had feared her decision to become a woman might end her Army career, but said it was ‘actually very forward thinking’. She began living openly as a woman after arriving at a new posting in North Yorkshire . Despite this, she was still desperate for an Army career. At 15, she joined a college for Armed Forces careers, before being sponsored by the Army to study electronic engineering at Newcastle University. Sandhurst soon followed. The soldier was later posted to Germany, where she asked doctors to begin her transition process. She was terrified what others might say, and at one point felt she couldn’t carry on living. But after finishing a tour of Afghanistan, she decided her life must change. When she arrived at a new posting in Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, she was living openly as a woman – and is now a year from the full transformation after beginning hormone therapy, having some surgery and her beard removed. She said: ‘You don’t know how the world is going to react. The fear sits on top of you and buries you. It is hard to claw your way out of it. ‘By going through hormone therapy and some surgery they have allowed me to change my body to an extent where I can feel happy enough to walk down the street as a female. 'People see a female and they interact with me as a female. It has given me self-confidence.’ As a captain in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Captain Winterbourne - who started her career as a man - is the most highly ranked transgender soldier in the Army and the only one to become an officer . The soldier decided her life had to change after completing a tour of duty at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . Captain Winterbourne said her parents had been ‘tremendously supportive’ and added: ‘They found it difficult. 'I don’t think any parent wouldn’t find it difficult. They were worried for me, worried I wouldn’t be able to live a normal life. But now they have seen me come through the process they are proud.’ She had feared her decision to become a woman might end her Army career, but said she discovered it has had an employment policy for transgender men and women since 1999. ‘Despite being perceived as a very masculine old school organisation, the army is actually very forward thinking’, she added.","Hannah Winterbourne was born a boy and spent time in Army as a man .

"The Duchess of Cambridge appeared to be through the worst of her antenatal sickness as she attended her third official engagement in as many days tonight. Kate, 32, who is around 13 weeks pregnant with her second child, glowed with good health at an Autumn Gala Evening dinner and reception at L’Anima Restaurant on behalf of the charity, Action on Addiction. Wearing a rather daring new black cocktail dress featuring slashed nude panels by Temperley London, with her long hair curled and flowing, she walked along a pink carpet as she entered the award-winning restaurant. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge attended the Action on Addiction charity gala in east London this evening in a £595 Temperley London dress, which accentuated her growing bump, and a pair of black suede stilettos . During a pre-dinner reception the Duchess met charity supporters and heard a speech by Action on Addiction Chairman John Lloyd, followed by a performance by comedian Rory Bremner. She will also stay for dinner at the award-winning Italian restaurant in the City of London. As soon as Kate arrived at the restaurant she was ushered towards a group of charity supporters including Swedish multi millionaire Hans Rausing. The 51-year-old was convicted in 2012 of preventing the lawful and decent burial of his wife Eva's body by keeping it in the house for two months after she died from a drug overdose. His new wife Julia said last night: 'It's wonderful to be here this evening and wonderful to chat to her (the Duchess).' Kate also spoke to charity supporter Christopher Holder and kept mum about the gender of her new baby. He said afterwards: 'She's a fabulous woman, she does so much for charity. 'She said she's loving being here. 'I think there was talk of her heels and there was talk about the baby and I think someone asked the question ""what is it going to be?"" but she didn't answer.' At 13 weeks on it is thought to be too early for Kate and William to find out the gender of their second child. The Duchess chose a pair of elegant diamond earrings to style her outfit. Her chestnut hair had been loosely curled for the occasion . The Duchess looked in good spirits as she chatted with supporters of the charity this evening in east London . It is her third public appearance this week after reportedly retreating to her parents' home to recover from morning sickness . One guest reportedly asked the Duchess about the sex of her second baby though she politely did not answer . It is not known if they will do so eventually but they chose not to find out George was a boy before he was born in July last year. On Tuesday the Duchess joined her husband, Prince William, as they represented the Queen to greet the President of Singapore, who is currently on a State Visit to the UK. It was the first time that she had been seen in public since news of her pregnancy was officially announced by Kensington Palace at the beginning of September, several weeks earlier than planned. Details were revealed as the Duchess had begun to suffer from the same chronic pregnancy-related sickness, Hyperemesis Gravidarum, that saw her hospitalised when she was expecting her son, Prince George, now 15 months. As a result of the condition, which can leave sufferers vomiting up to 30 times a day, she was forced to cancel a string of public visits, including her first solo foreign tour abroad. Palace official say that while the Duchess hasn’t entirely recovered, she is feeling well enough to take on a limited number of engagements on a ‘case by case basis’. It is the third time the Duchess has been seen in public since revealing she was suffering with the condition which saw her seeking hospital treatment during her first pregnancy with Prince George . It is the Duchess's third appearance this week after getting over the worst of her morning sickness . Kate was forced to cancel a number of engagements as a result of the illness which brought on severe vomiting . The Duchess of Cambridge wore her hair in loose curls and accessorised with drop earrings and a black, beaded evening bag at the event . After Tuesday’s engagement with the sovereign, which also included riding with her husband in a state carriage to Buckingham Palace, Kate also attended the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards at the Natural History Museum. The charity she is supporting tonight, Action and Addiction, is the only one in the UK to be working across the fields of research, prevention, treatment, professional education and family support. It also runs two residential treatment centres, Clouds House in Wiltshire and Hope House, a women only centre, in Clapham, south London. The charity also offers programs to help the families of substance misusers including the M- PACT programme - Moving Parents And Children Together - which supports young people living with addicted parents. The Duchess has a particular interest in providing early support to children living with parental addiction and launched M-PACT Plus in 2013, which is run in partnership with another of the charities she supports, Place2Be. She has been patron of Action on Addiction since January 2012. All wrapped up: A small, neat bow on her Temperley dress accentuated Kate's new bump. Guests at the dinner excitedly asked the Duchess about the sex of the baby but she did not reveal anything . The Duchess of Cambridge heard a speech given by Action on Addiction supporters at the restaurant this evening . Pictured with the charity's Fundraising Director, Tristan Millington-Drake, the Duchess looked elegant in the flattering dress which highlighted her bump with a neat black bow . At around 10pm the Duchess was seen leaving the event, carrying a small posy of bright pink flowers . The bright bouquet was in keeping with the event's colour scheme, with a fuchsia carpet rolled out in front of the restaurant. As she entered her car the Duchess held the bouquet protectively in front of her growing bump . Earlier this week the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made their first public appearance in weeks at a ceremony welcoming the President of Singapore and his wife . Later that day the Duchess attended an awards ceremony at the Natural History Museum without the Duke of Cambridge . Dressed in a baby blue Jenny Packham gown, the Duchess's bump was less visible on Tuesday evening .","The Duchess of Cambridge attended an Action on Addiction gala dinner .

"The family of a British hostage who has been threatened with beheading by the terror group Islamic State (IS) have pleaded to the militants to contact them in an effort to save his life. David Haines has been held prisoner for more than a year in Syria, but it was only earlier this month that the world learned of his captivity when he was seen in a video released by IS. The same video appeared to show the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. Then in the final seconds, a gaunt and hollow-eyed Mr Haines is seen being clutched by the collar of his orange robe by a masked man with a British accent, who warned that further air strikes will lead to the British aid worker’s death. Fears are growing for aid worker David Haines after he appeared on his knees in a jihadi video. His family revealed last night that they have tried to contact the group holding him but have had no reply . The family of David Haines, the British father-of-two being held captive by Islamic State terrorists in Syria, have urged the group to contact them after he was threatened with execution . Mr Haines' second wife, Dragana Prodanovic Haines (pictured), has previously said she cries for her husband 'every day' but refuses to tell their four-year-old daughter of his capture . Last month the same masked man – dubbed ‘Jihadi John’ – was seen in a video showing the apparent killing of US journalist James Foley, 41. Before his death, Foley spoke to the camera saying that the US air raids had signed his ‘death certificate’. Mr Haines’s family have made several attempts to contact IS, which now controls large swathes of northern Syria and Iraq, but so far without any response. In a statement released through the Foreign Office, the family said: ‘We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.’ Mr Haines, from Perth, has a 17-year-old daughter, from a previous marriage, in Scotland. He also has a four-year-old daughter in Croatia with his current wife, Dragana Prodanovic Haines. Mrs Haines revealed last week that she ‘cries every day’ for her husband, and has not yet told her daughter of his capture. Mr Haines has been a lifelong aid worker in war-torn regions such as Libya and South Sudan. He was working for Acted, a French aid agency, at Atmeh in Idlib province, northern Syria, when he was kidnapped at gunpoint in March 2013. The US has not stopped bombing IS targets in Iraq since the Sotloff video came out, and last week President Obama said he may expand the bombings to target the terror group in Syria. David Cameron reaffirmed the British Government’s policy of refusing to pay ransoms to terrorists. Father-of-two Mr Haines, 44, was taken while working for relief agency Acted in Syria in March 2013 . The IS terrorist known as 'Jihadi John' has already executed two U.S. journalists, James Foley (pictured) and Steven Sotloff, and threatened that Mr Haines will be next . IS did not say when Mr Haines would be executed if their demands were not met, but on jihadi social media accounts it is rumoured the video of his execution will be released by Saturday. Although the Foreign Office refused to say what steps it is taking to have Mr Haines released, it reiterated the Government’s stance that it does not pay ransom. A spokesman said: ‘Our policy is longstanding and clear. We do not make substantive concessions. But we will talk to groups and individuals who we feel might be able to help save lives.’ Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, was also kidnapped with Mr Haines. Motka, 31, was freed in May after his government apparently paid millions of pounds to IS to secure his release. Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Mr Haines was tortured in captivity with Tasers, and was singled out by his captors for brutal treatment because he was British. He developed severe vomiting and diarrhoea, and his health became so dire that his captors called a doctor. He was held hostage along with Foley and Sotloff and other Westerners by a group of British IS members known as ‘the Beatles’, with one believed to be Jihadi John. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said the Foreign Office will be doing 'everything' they can to protect Mr Haines. The relief agency Acted has previously said that the threats made to the Scotsman's life were 'intolerable'. In a statement, it said: 'Acted strongly condemns the violence and threats against David. A man's life should never be threatened on account of his humanitarian commitment.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is doing 'everything it can' in order to protect Mr Haines (file pic) Mr Haines was seized shortly after leaving the Atmeh refugee camp (pictured) in Syria.

"A secret Bible in which Jesus is believed to predict the coming of the Prophet Muhammad to Earth has sparked serious interest from the Vatican. Pope Benedict XVI is claimed to want to see the 1,500-year-old book, which many say is the Gospel of Barnabas, that has been hidden by the Turkish state for the last 12 years. The £14million handwritten gold lettered tome, penned in Jesus' native Aramaic language, is said to contain his early teachings and a prediction of the Prophet's coming. Secret Bible: The 1,500-year-old tome was is said to contain Jesus' early teachings and his prediction of the Prophet's coming . Ancient: The leather-bound text, written on animal hide, was discovered by Turkish police during an anti-smuggling operation in 2000 . The leather-bound text, written on animal hide, was discovered by Turkish police during an anti-smuggling operation in 2000. It was closely guarded until 2010, when it was finally handed over to the Ankara Ethnography Museum, and will soon be put back on public display following a minor restoration. A photocopy of a single page from the handwritten ancient manuscript is thought to be worth £1.5million. Turkish culture and tourism minister Ertugrul Gunay said the book could be an authentic version of the Gospel, which was suppressed by the Christian Church for its strong parallels with the Islamic view of Jesus. He also said the Vatican had made an official request to see the scripture - a controversial text which Muslims claim is an addition to the original gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke and John. In line with Islamic belief, the Gospel treats Jesus as a human being and not a God. Serious interest: The Vatican, under Pope Benedict XVI, is said to want to see the recently re-discovered Bible . Historic: The £14million handwritten gold lettered tome is penned in Jesus' native Aramaic language . It rejects the ideas of the Holy Trinity and the Crucifixion and reveals that Jesus predicted the coming of the Prophet Muhammad. In one version of the gospel, he is said to have told a priest: 'How shall the Messiah be called? Muhammad is his blessed name'. Born in Cyprus as Joseph, Barnabas was an Early Christian later named an apostle. His story appears in the Acts of the Apostles, and Paul mentions him in some of his epistles. The date, place, and circumstances of his death are historically unverifiable. But Christian tradition states that he was martyred at Salamis, Cyprus. He is traditionally identified as the founder of the Cypriot Church, with his feast day on June 11. And in another Jesus denied being the Messiah, claiming that he or she would be Ishmaelite, the term used for an Arab. Despite the interest in the newly re-discovered book, some believe it is a fake and only dates back to the 16th century. The oldest copies of the book date back to that time, and are written in Spanish and Italian. Protestant pastor İhsan Özbek said it was unlikely to be authentic. This is because St Barnabas lived in the first century and was one of the Apostles of Jesus, in contrast to this version which is said to come from the fifth or sixth century. He told the Today Zaman newspaper: 'The copy in Ankara might have been written by one of the followers of St Barnabas. 'Since there is around 500 years in between St Barnabas and the writing of the Bible copy, Muslims may be disappointed to see that this copy does not include things they would like to see. 'It might have no relation with the content of the Gospel of Barnabas.' Theology professor Ömer Faruk Harman said a scientific scan of the bible may be the only way to reveal how old it really is.","Vatican 'wants to see' 1,500-year-old ancient script .

"Sam Allardyce collected the Barclays Manager of the Month accolade on Friday and then advised rival Paul Lambert to take a holiday during next week's international break. The West Ham boss, who faces Aston Villa's Lambert at Upton Park on Saturday, shared one of the secrets of his success: 'Get out of the country in an international break. Re-focus your mind and body so you're ready for the next phase.' In a double boost for West Ham, Allardyce's achievement was matched by Senegal striker Diafra Sakho, who scooped the Player of the Month prize. Sam Allardyce picked up the manager of the Month award after guiding  his team to fifth in the Premier League . Hammers boss has advised Paul Lambert (C) to refocus on holiday during the international break . The award for Allardyce, 60, represents a remarkable turnaround for the manager who was booed and jeered by many West Ham fans last season for what they took as unimaginative boring football, and an uninspired final 13th place finish in the table. West Ham have been a different side this season playing with an attractive attacking style and verve often associated with the club in the past -- but not for many years. West Ham new boy Diafra Sakho has been in brilliant form since signing for the club in the summer . Sakho and Allardyce pose after picking up their respective awards for their performances in October . Allardyce told Sky Sports: 'The most pleasing thing of all is that we have managed to pull all the new players together and fitted them into a team that is playing very well at the moment and enjoying their football and getting some exceptionally good results.' West Ham are currently fifth in the standings and beat Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and champions Manchester City during October before coming from two goals down to force a 2-2 draw at Stoke City last weekend.","Sam Allardyce has collected the Barclays Manager of the Month award .

"A 27-year-old mother of two has been fatally shot by an off-duty sheriff's deputy after he suspected her of shoplifting at a Houston Walmart. Harris County Sheriff's deputies have said that victim Shelly Frey, Tisa Andrews and Yolanda Craig  were stealing when they were confronted by Louis Campbell a 26-year veteran of the force who works as a security guard at the store. According to Campbell the women ran to their car and when he rushed to open the door, they accelerated away - at which point he fired the deadly shot into the car which hit Frey in the neck. Scroll Down for Video . Shelly Frey (left and right) was shot in the neck and died after failing to stop for an off-duty sheriff's deputy in Houston, Texas . Security at the store on the 14000 block of the North Freeway had noticed the three women 'stuffing items inside their purses' and notified Campbell, who was working an extra job that evening. Investigators with Harris County said the three women even attempted to pay for some small items to act as a cover for the shoplifted ones. After chasing Frey and the other two women to their car, Campbell opened the door and commanded Frey to get out. But she refused, officials said . Andrews began to drive away while the deputy was standing between the open door and the driver's seat. 'She threw it in reverse and tried to run over the deputy,' said Harris County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Deputy Thomas Gilliland. 'He confronted the suspects at exit of the store before they left. One female wouldn't stop, struck the deputy with her purse, ran off.' 'I think it knocked him off balance and, in fear of his life and being ran over, he discharged his weapon at that point.' Tiasa Andrews, Yolanda Craig were arrested at 1300 block of Greens Parkway where their friend Shelly Frey had died from her gunshot wounds . The Walmart store at 14000 block of the North Freeway in Houston where the alleged robbery occurred . Inside the car as it was speeding away were two small children - investigators have said that they were not Frey's children. Gilliland said it was clear that the deputy was law enforcement. 'He was clearly marked in uniform as a Harris County deputy. And identified himself as the suspects were leaving the establishment,' said Gilliland to KHOU.Com . Despite the shooting, the women fled but eventually they stopped at The Worthington at the Beltway apartments in the 1300 block of Greens Parkway. Paramedics from the Houston Fire Department arrived to try and save Frey, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. 'Shelly was the perfect mom, perfect friend, perfect daughter,' said her father, Shelton Frey to KHOU. He said that his daughter had moved to Houston after Hurricane Katrina to start a new life, but the amount of work she could do was limited by her two-year-old who has sickle cell anemia. The deceased's mother Sharon Wilkerson was devastated that the deputy fired into a car with two small children inside and killed her daughter . 'Why couldn’t you just shoot the tire, shoot the window?' said her mother Sharon Wilkerson. 'Was it that serious?' She added that even if her daughter had committed a crime, she did not deserve to die and she worries now for her two young grandchildren. 'How do I tell these children she's not coming back,' said Sharon to KHOU. 'To me, it should never (have) happened. I wish the officer didn’t shoot her. I wish he shot her tires just to slow her down. That’s a mother you know. And now they have to figure out what to do with the kids,' said Angel Gaines, a neighbor. Kesha Sapp, a woman who knew Frey, agreed. 'What that look like with him shooting with the darn kids in the car? There were kids in the car with them. Why is he shooting at the car? Come on now, that makes him look bad. That don’t even look right,' said Sapp. Both Andrews and Craig, the two other women allegedly involved, have been charged with shoplifting according to KHOU. Tragically, Frey wasn't even supposed to be at a Walmart that evening. Earlier in the year she pleaded guilty to stealing shirts and a package of meat from another Walmart and as part of her plea arrangement she agreed to never enter Walmart stores again. Deputy Campbell is on three days paid leave as is standard protocol. He's been with the Harris County Sheriff's Office for 26 years. The . Harris County Sheriff's Homicide Unit, Office of the Inspector General . and the Harris County District Attorney's Office will investigate this . incident. The case will be turned over to a grand jury. Walmart offered the following statement: 'This is a tragic . situation and we recognize this is a difficult time for all parties . involved. We're committed to working with law enforcement and providing . any information we have as they determine the facts of the case. Because . this is an active investigation, any specific details of the incident . should come from law enforcement. 'We hire off duty officers to . provide security to some of our stores. While we have policies in place . for our associates to disengage from situations that might put them or . others in harm's way, off-duty officers working at a WM store are . authorized to act in accordance with their department's code of . conduct.'","Shelly Frey was shot dead attempting to drive away from off-duty sheriff deputy Louis Campbell who suspected her of shoplifting .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has highlighted Liverpool's striker Divock Origi as the biggest threat facing his side in Lille on Thursday night in a match the Spaniard describes as 'a little final' along the road to Europa League knockout qualification. Origi, 19, signed for Liverpool from Lille in a £10million deal last summer following a speactacular World Cup but was immediately loaned back to his French club, where he has scored four goals this season. Martinez said of the pacy striker: 'He is a well-known player in England already, because of his play at the World Cup and because he signed for our big rivals Liverpool. Everton manager Roberto Martinez sees the club's trip to Lille as a 'mini final' in their Europa League group . Liverpool loanee Divock Origi has been identified by Martinez as Lille's main threat to Everton . 'We know in years to come he will have a big say in the Premier League.' Everton top their group with four points from two matches while Lille have drawn both their opening games. With only two to qualify from a four-team group that also features Krasnodar and Wolfsburg, Martinez regards their game in northern France as key. Martinez says Thursday's game is the most important of the group campaign for both clubs . Dangerman Origi starred at the World Cup with Belgium before sealing a move to Liverpool this summer . 'Lille might see this as the most important game of their campaign and it is the same for us. It could be a little-final. I must admit I admired the way they played last season. 'Maybe now they are waiting to click this season and that is our worry. We need to concentrate, we don't want them to click on Thursday.' Everton have taken a strong squad to Lille including  20-year-old  Ross Barkley, who made his first appearance of the season against Aston Villa on Saturday after recovering from a knee ligament injury. Ross Barkley made his return to the Everton side after his injury in the 3-0 win over Aston Villa . Barkley could play some part in the 'little final' in France and Martinez looks to guide Everton through . Barkley is expected to make his European debut cheered on by nearly 7,000 travelling Everton fans. Leon Osman and Steven Naismith have been kept on Merseyside to rest after an intense run of matches while Bryan Oviedo, Kevin Mirallas and Arouna Kone miss out through injury. But 36-year-old Sylvain Distin has travelled after missing the last four games. 'It is an exciting game from our point of view. We have been looking forward to this fixture,' said Martinez. 'We have a phenomenal support and could have sold a lot more seats. We know our fans are going to travel in big big numbers and we want to make them proud.' Around 7,000 Everton fans are expected to be in Lille for the game, with a number travelling without tickets .","Liverpool loanee Divock Origi comes up against Everton on Thursday .

"Sharon Kerwin always hoped she'd have a little girl to make her family complete - and her dream came true when her daughter Rebecca was born. But at the age of 10, Rebecca started acting and dressing as a boy and by 16, she revealed she was transgender and changed her name to Blake. Sharon, from Wigan, accepted her son's decision yet the pair were beset by bullying and abuse that led Blake, now 17, to self harm and even attempt suicide. Born Rebecca (left), Blake Kerwin (right)  felt different as a small child and  began living as a boy from age 10 . Blake and his supportive mother Sharon appeared on ITV's This Morning to talk about his journey . Sharon noticed her daughter was different at the age of six, when she became fascinated by her brother's toys and games. She said: 'it started quite young, playing with boy's toys and [being] interested in boys stuff. He used to copy his brother all the time, taking his stuff and following and copying everything he used to do.' As well as emulating his brother, as Rebecca, Blake also flew into uncontrollable rages. These fits became so bad and so frequent Sharon even took him to the doctor to seek advice. 'We thought it was ADHD at first and he was tested and they couldn't find anything. nothing at all was wrong.' Blake explains that he couldn't put his finger on what he was feeling for years. He said: 'I knew when I was very young that something wasn't right. I used to have these tantrums and be exploding all the time. Both Blake and Sharon received abuse over his decision to live as a man with his mother's complete support . 'I came out as bisexual at 12 but I wasn't, I just thought I would be more accepted.' Sharon decided to be entirely accepting of what her then daughter was telling her, but suspected there was something more underneath it. Blake is is using his experience to help others struggling with gender identity issues . 'It was very important that I listened and understood what was making him unhappy. 'I just went along with it. I wanted to see Blake happy instead of so stressed over his gender at the time. 'I had an idea there was something more but I didn't want to question him too much. 'I had a conversation with someone who was gay and they said not to push him, just to wait until Blake told me in his own time.' Sharon's intuition turned out to be right and Blake eventually realised that he was not bisexual, but transgender. At the age of 16, Blake came out to his mother as transgender and formally changed his name by deed poll. While Sharon accepted Blake at every step of his journey, others were not so understanding and both Blake and Sharon suffered at the hands of bullies. Some people accused Sharon of somehow encouraging Blake and the abuse became so bad at one point that he began self-harming and he even attempted suicide. But his transformation into a male body has, Blake says, helped him move on from these dark times and he now feels hopeful about his future. He said: 'I'm actually progressing more because of the transitioning. It's hurrying along so I've got more hope in myself.' While the support he's had from his mother and grandmother has been 'brilliant'. For her part, Sharon says she doesn't miss  having a daughter. 'I don't miss it at all. He is still Blake and I am so so proud of him and the way that he has come out. Blake will begin taking hormones soon but will have to wait until he turns 18 before beginning his full physical transformation. He now is using his experience to help others struggling with gender identity issues through a transgender support group.

"This summer's World Cup might have added a fourth star to Germany's shirts, but it also lost them some of their more experienced stars. Captain Philipp Lahm, Arsenal's Per Mertesacker and World Cup record goalscorer Miroslav Klose all went out on the ultimate high into international retirement, taking with them the know-how that comes with 354 caps between them. With injuries adding up too, Joachim Low gave the chance to some of the next generation of German stars. Here's Sportsmail's verdict on how they got on: . Sebastian Rudy . Age: 24 . Position: Midfielder (played at right back against Scotland) Club: Hoffenheim . Minutes played: 90 . Rudy might not initially be considered 'young', but he's pretty new to the German national side and this was just his third cap - his second since the World Cup. Scotland's mainly defensive outlook, particularly down the flanks allowed the Hoffenheim man to push forward into the positions he normally occupies in midfield - and it paid off for Thomas Muller's opener. Drifting in a cross from deep, Rudy found Muller to head past David Marshall and give the home side the lead. And that was typical of his first-half performance, finding pockets of space out on the right and sending balls in to the box with Germany seemingly comfortable with dominating the wide areas. On the charge: Sebastian Rudy took the opportunity to get down the right flank and attacked Scotland . Resolute: Rudy slides in on Scotland's Ikechi Anya as the visitors try to launch a counter attack in Dortmund . His passing was perfect - 30 came in total during that dominant first period - and with a 100% completion rate. He even managed a shot on goal but his drive from 20 yards was well saved by Marshall on the half-hour mark. The second half though was a bit of a different story though - he found himself ripped to shreds by Scotland's suddenly more potent counter-attacking game - and it was Rudy left miles out of position when Ikechi Anya steamed through down the left to equalise. He constantly found himself troubled as the visitors got more into the game and his lack of familiarity with the position perhaps showed as Anya grew into the game. Defensive duties: Rudy is used to being further up the pitch but did well at the back at times . Whoops! Anya hares away from Rudy as he is caught out with his positioning in an unfamiliar role . Erik Durm . Age: 22 . Position: Left back . Club: Borussia Dortmund . Minutes played: 90 . Durm was another who benefited from Scotland's withdrawn positioning down the flanks - constantly pressing Barry Bannan back, restricting his creative skills and giving Germany a platform to attack. He took his opportunities to go forward and was already setting up Muller for a chance just eight minutes into the game with a brilliant right-footed cross. Comfortable: Durm makes sure Charlie Mulgrew can't get a clean shot at goal during the first half . And he was able to mix it up too - with a 20-yard strike troubling Marshall as Scotland held firm. He cynically brought down Steven Naismith as Scotland went in search of a second equaliser and was lucky not to see red - that aside it was a solid performance down the left from the Borussia Dortmund defender. Easy does it: And Durm guides the same man away from the penalty area on another Scotland counter . Seeing them off: Barry Bannan couldn't do anything to get away from Durm on this occasion . Christoph Kramer . Age: 23 . Position: Midfielder . Club: Bayer Leverkusen (on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach) Minutes played: 90 . A solid partner to Toni Kroos in midfield, Kramer proved an able deputy for German skipper Bastian Schweinsteiger and Real Madrid's Sami Khedira. He made his first-ever competitive start in the World Cup final but that ended in injury - on this occasion he was able to play a more active role - sitting deep and sweeping up anything that evaded Kroos as he advanced through the middle. Getting forward: Christoph Kramer played alongside Toni Kroos but still got opportunities going forward . Good touch: Kramer takes control and moves away from Mulgrew as he performs in the German midfield pair . Kramer has been linked with Manchester United this week and his performance, adding steel to the German midfield, might just have impressed Louis van Gaal who is lookign for similar characteristics in the centre of the park. Defensively he wasn't too frequently tested but he managed to see off a few Scottish attacks early on, nipping in to keep the pressure on the visitors in Dortmund. Careful: Kramer wins this duel to keep the pressure on Scotland as they tried to break away . Defensive duties: Kramer wins the ball above Darren Fletcher in the air as he won the midfield battle .

"When a five-month-old baby stopped breathing while being driven along a Florida highway on Thursday there was plenty of help at hand. As Pamela Rauseo pulled over and screamed for someone to help her nephew, Sebastian, a police officer and two firefighters who were stuck in traffic rushed to her aid. In a twist of fate, award-winning photojournalist Al Diaz was also in the traffic hold up, and captured a series of dramatic pictures showing the emergency crews saving the baby's life.

Emergency: Pamela Rauseo performs CPR on her baby nephew after he stopped breathing in her car . Sebastian, who suffers from respiratory problems after being born prematurely, had started to turn blue as Ms Rauseo drove along a highway at 2.30pm. She quickly pulled over and lifted him from the car, screaming for help. Diaz, who works for the Miami Herald, said he heard a woman 'screaming that the baby can't breathe'. The photographer then took a series of dramatic pictures showing fellow motorists and emergency workers who were on their way to work rushing to save the baby. One of the first on the scene was Lucila Godoy. Leaving her three-year-old son in her car, Godoy rushed to help as Rauseo performed CPR on her nephew.

"MK Dons’ 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli will have the chance to show why the Premier league’s big boys are after him against Manchester United on Tuesday night. Alli has taken League One by storm since establishing himself as one of the Dons’ key men at a tender age. The highly-rated midfielder made his debut in 2012 in an FA Cup first round match against Cambridge City at the age of 16 and his first goal for the club came in the replay at stadium:mk. VIDEO Scroll down to watch MK Dons prepare for United Cup clash with back heel keepy ups . Talent: 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli will come up against Manchester United on Tuesday night . Alli was strongly linked with a move to Liverpool in the summer, having been monitored by the Anfield giants throughout the year. Liverpool were hopeful of completing a £3.5million summer swoop for Alli and the Anfield club had opened talks with the League One club over a move for the 18-year-old midfielder. MK Dons manager Karl Robinson raves about him, saying earlier this year: 'He is one of the most gifted 17-year-olds this country has ever seen. 'I've said from the word go, he's as good as it gets and he's the best young player I've ever worked with.’ Although he made his debut in 2012, it was last season where he became an important figure in the Dons’ starting XI, making a total of 37 appearances, scoring seven goals. The Milton Keynes-born star is known for his intelligence and maturity on the ball, a trait seldom seen in someone so young (he was born in 1996, don’t forget). Robinson’s young prodigy also managed to net his first professional hat-trick last season in a 3-1 victory over Notts County. Youth: The MK Dons youngster made his debut at the age of 16 in an FA Cup match against Cambridge City . It is obvious Alli has an eye for goal as in his last season for the under 18s, he finished as the top scorer with 17, leading him to sign a three-year professional contract. He has started this season in a similar fashion, already netting his first goal of the season in the 3-2 loss at Peterborough United. Alli has made nine and two appearances for the England Under 17s and 18s respectively but is yet to get on the scoresheet at international level. Having shown so much promise, if Alli is able to continue his progress it’s hard to see him remaining an MK Dons player for much longer, especially if he impresses against Premier League opponents. Indeed, the side he’s facing on Tuesday night could well be his future destination. On the move? Alli was strongly linked to a move to Liverpool this summer as the club monitored his progress . Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page here. Backing: MK Dons boss Karl Robinson believes Alli is one of the most gifted youngsters in the country . Ian McLoughlin – signed for MK Dons in July 2011 after being released by Ipswich has since made 14 appearances for the Dons, with four coming in the League Cup. George Baldock – academy player, joined club at age of ten and made his full first team debut as a 17 year old in a 2-1 win over Oldham Athletic in the 2010/11 season. Antony Kay – signed from Huddersfield Town in 2012, Kay made his debut in the League Cup against Cheltenham Town, converting the fourth spot kick of a 5-3 penalty shootout win after a 1-1 draw. Kyle McFadzean – signed from Crawley Town last month for an undisclosed fee, has so started in all five of the Dons’ games this season. Dean Lewington – the club captain passed the 500 game mark for his side last season and is the only player to have remained on MK Dons’ books since the club was formed in 2004. Darren Potter – joined the Dons in July 2011 and was named the side’s Player of the Year in his first season. Formerly of Liverpool. Samir Carruthers – signed permanently for the Dons last month after spending last year on loan from Aston Villa at the Stadium MK. Made his Premier League debut for the West Midlands side in 1-1 draw against Liverpool in the 2011/12 season. Ben Reeves – the ex-Southampton man made a wonderful start to his MK Dons career last season, winning four awards including Player of the Year and Player’s Player of the Year. Daniel Powell – the academy graduate made a blistering start to his career, scoring in first team debut against Hartlepool United in 2008, aged just 17 years and 248 days. Will Grigg – on a season-long loan from Brentford, Grigg has so far scored one goal in four appearances for Karl Robinson’s side.","Dele Alli looks set to feature for MK Dons against Manchester United .

"An MIT-educated neuroscientist terrorist known as 'Lady al Qaeda' was named on a 'laundry list' of demands from ISIS captors holding James Foley named, it was revealed today. Petite mother-of-three Aafia Siddiqui is currently serving 86 years in a Texas jail after being arrested with plans for a 'mass casualty attack' in the US, including infecting people with Ebola and a dirty bomb. But President Barack Obama's administration point blank refused to consider releasing Siddiqui, or handing over a $132 million ransom, according to the New York Times. Scroll down for video . Lady Al Qeada: Aafia Siddiqui is currently serving 86 years in a Texas jail after being arrested with plans for a 'mass casualty attack' in the US, including infecting people with Ebola and a dirty bomb. She was named by Foley's captors on a 'laundry list' as the person they wanted in a prisoner swap . Hunted: Mother-of-three Siddiqui, who is 5 ft. 4 in. and weighs just 90 lb, was on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list after 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed mentioned her name during his 2003 interrogation . Karachi-born Siddiqui, 42, attended two New England universities. She gained a PhD from Brandeis and then trained as a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She founded the Institute of Islamic Research and Teaching while living in the U.S. Mother-of-three Siddiqui, who is 5 ft. 4 in. and weighs just 90 lb, was on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list after 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed mentioned her name during his 2003 interrogation. Siddiqui, who is divorced from her first husband is now married to Ammar al-Baluchi, one of the 9/11 masterminds, who is currently being held in Guantanamo. He is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Burqa-clad Siddiqui was arrested in Ghanzi, Afghanistan in 2008 after a local saw her poring over a map. He became suspicious as most women in that country are illiterate. When she was held she had detailed plans on how to kill by spreading Ebola, making a dirty bomb and even a theoretical chemical weapon that somehow spared children while killing adults. She also had two pounds of highly toxic sodium cyanide hidden in her bag and documents detailing potential New York targets for attack including Wall Street, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of Liberty and the subway system. The documents also showed the Plum Island Animal Disease Center on Long Island Sound, New York - which was used for biological weapons testing during the Cold War - as another potential target. During interrogation the day after her arrest she grabbed a rifle that had been left on a table and started shooting at her questioners. She failed to hit them but she was shot in the stomach as they returned fire. Author Deborah Scroggins, who wrote a book about Siddiqui, calls her the 'poster child for jihadists around the world.' 'I doesn't surprise me that ISIS should call for her release, even though she is associated with al-Qaeda, because they want to take over al-Qaeda's mantle,' she told MailOnline. 'What better way to establish your bona fides than to exchange a prisoner for the jihadist's icon?' Scroggins, whose book, Wanted Women: Faith, Lies, and the War on Terror was published in 2012, points out that Siddiqui received an 86-year jail sentence despite never harming anyone, and it has never been fully explained whether her plans were realistic or just in her head. Demands: Obama refused to negotiate with the terrorists over Foley's release - in stark contrast to suspected deserter Bowe Bergdahl who was released to huge controversy in exchange for five Taliban prisoners . Siddiqui was only charged with two counts of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and three counts of assault. She was brought to the U.S. for trial which lasted for 14 days in January and February 2010. 'She was only tried for firing a gun at U.S. personnel overseas and Congress had just passed a law, going back to the attacks on the embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, that said anyone trying to kill U.S. personnel would get special strict sentencing,' said Scroggins. During her trial she said she loved both the United States and Islam. Her lawyers pleaded for leniency due to mental issues, but she said: 'I am not paranoid. I do not agree with that.' 'I do not want any bloodshed. I do not want any misunderstanding. I really want to make peace and end the wars,' she said during her trial. Siddiqui - prisoner number 90279-054 - is currently held in the Federal Medical Center in Carswell, Texas, which specializes in treating inmates with mental health issues. She is not due for release until August 8, 2083. Scroggins added: 'She is definitely closely involved with the highest levels of al-Qaeda, but the fact is she has never been convicted of killing or injuring anyone, but she has become a cause celebre in the jihadist movement.' Her 86-year sentence, imposed by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, led to violent protests in her home country of Pakistan. Thousands of protestors burned tires in Lahore, and police had to fire teargas to quell riots in her hometown of Karachi. Failed rescue: Obama authorized instead a daring mission to snatch back Foley and his fellow captives on July 4. But after a firefight, special forces realized the hostages were not there . Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani called Siddiqui 'the daughter of the nation' and begged U.S. authorities to release her. While Obama did swap five Taliban prisoners in exchange for suspected deserter Bowe Bergdahl, who was freed on May 31 to huge controversy,Obama authorized a  daring rescue mission over the July 4 weekend that failed in the Syrian desert. At least five ISIS militants were killed and one American soldier was wounded as the raid failed because the terrorists had moved Foley and other hostages including Miami journalist Steven Sotloff away from the base in Syria's northern Raqqa province. Scroggins said the question of whether Siddiqui's release would be a real threat is doubtful. 'But exchanging her would have been a PR disaster for the Obama administration.' She pointed out that the prisoners released in exchange for Bergdahl had not been convicted and tried in a U.S. court as Siddiqui was. Her release would certainly have been perceived as a tremendous victory for the jihadist forces,' said Scroggins.","ISIS sent 'laundry list' of demands for release of James Foley .

"He was a leading figure in one of the biggest climate change marches to date. But it seems Robert F Kennedy Jr was not so forthcoming when it came to questions about his own carbon footprint. Confronted by a reporter asking if he would give up his phone and car, the environmental lawyer became visibly irate before grabbing the microphone and accusing her of 'destroying democracy' as a member of the press. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Loses his cool: Robert F Kennedy Jr grabbed the microphone from a reporter and pointed at her aggressively after she probed him on his own use of a phone and a car at a climate change march in New York yesterday . Irate: The multi-millionaire environmental lawyer branded Michelle Fields' questions 'inane' The interview in New York yesterday afternoon started with a conversation about the number of flyers produced for the event, which Kennedy Jr claimed was necessary to garner 'people power'. PJ Media reporter Michelle Fields then asked the 60-year-old if he has an iPhone or an Android. Kennedy Jr stuttered: '...I have a cell phone.' 'Are you concerned about the damage that the cell phone and electricity generation causes to the environment?' He exclaimed: 'Are you joking about this!' 'No, I want to know if you're willing to give up your iPhone,' she asks. 'No.' 'Why not? Doesn't it start with people like you?' 'No.' Points: The campaigner repeatedly points in Fields' face while refusing to give up his phone for the cause . Fields laughs as Kennedy Jr accuses the media of 'destroying democracy' and refuses to give up his phone . Forward: He then tells Fields to give up her own car before saying nobody should have to forfeit anything . Reaction: Fields tweeted about Kennedy being 'handsy', Twitter users responded attacking Kennedy's actions . The conversation then fell into confusion. Fields asked: 'So will you lead by example?' Kennedy Jr interrupted: 'No no...I do lead by example.' 'Are you going to give up your cell phone?' she said. 'No,' he responded. 'Are you going to give up your car?' Visibly aggravated, Kennedy Jr pointed his finger in the reporter's face and barked: 'Are you going to give up your car?' She calmly responds: 'I'm not the one who's here talking about the environment'. The multi-millionaire then declared he will not stop using a phone or a car because he does not believe that quality of life should be sacrificed for the environment. March: Kennedy was marching alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in New York yesterday ahead of a UN summit . All-star: Mark Ruffalo also joined the crowds as tens of thousands came out against the Koch brothers . Major event: 550 busloads had arrived for the rally, which also took place in the UK, France and Afghanistan . Finally, Kennedy Jr launched a direct attack at the young woman in which he grabbed the microphone and called her questions 'inane'. Pointing in her face, he says: 'One of the biggest canards that the press if falling for is blaming individuals for their own choices. That's not the issue, the issue is what's happening on Capitol Hill and that's the thing you guys aren't paying attention to. 'You're letting these people you're letting the Koch brothers run our country, subvert our democracy, corrupt our politicians, capture the -' Fields tries to ask a question but Kennedy Jr grabs the mic aggressively and continues: '...capture the agencies that are protecting us from pollution, and destroying local democracy on every level. 'And that's what you ought to be paying attention to rather than asking trivial and inane questions about what kind of car somebody drives or whether or not they use cell phones.' His outburst came as tens of thousands pounded the streets of New York for the People's Climate March in midtown Manhattan, ahead of Tuesday's United Nations hosted summit in the city to discuss reducing carbon emissions that threaten the environment. Organizers said some 550 busloads had arrived for the rally, which followed similar events in 166 countries including Britain, France, Afghanistan and Bulgaria.","Environmental lawyer was a leader in New York climate change march .

"Crazed: The gunman has been identified as 42-year-old Pedro Vargas . A grazed gunman stalked from apartment to apartment, systematically killing his neighbors at a South Florida apartment complex before a police SWAT team shot him dead early Saturday. Police described how Pedro Vargas methodically executed the managers of his building and a family that lived nearby - before firing randomly into the street and killing a man who was parking his car. Police say he kicked his way into a third-floor apartment, where he shot to death Patricio Simono, 54; his wife Merly Niebles, 51; and their 17-year-old daughter Priscilla Perez. The Miami Herald reports that he hunted down Perez as she hid in the bathtub and shot her dead. Family members said Simono worked at a car wash and Niebles cleaned hotel rooms. Their daughter wanted to be a nurse. Marcela Chavarri, director of the American Christian School, said the Perez was about to enter her senior year. 'She was a lovely girl,' Chavarri said through tears. 'She was always happy and helping her classmates.' Scroll down for video . Shamira Piscioti cries on the phone after her parents Italo Piscioti, 78, and Samira Piscioti, 68, were shot to death at an apartment building in Hialeah, Florida . Two of the gunman's victims where 78-year-old Italo Pisciotti, left, and 68-year-old Samira, left, who were property managers at the apartment complex . Detectives were investigating whether Vargas had any ongoing disputes with the building manager, as some residents believed. Vargas lived in the fourth-floor apartment with his mother. She was not home at the time of the shootings. 'He was a good son,' said Ester Lazcano, who lived on the same floor as Vargas and his mother. 'He'd take her in the morning to run errands' and to doctor appointments. Miriam Valdes, 70, was in a friend's apartment two doors down. She said she heard officers trying to convince Vargas to surrender. She said the gunman first asked for his girlfriend and then his mother but refused to cooperate. Valdes said Vargas was also known as a difficult person who sometimes got into fights and yelled at his mother. 'He was a very abusive person,' she said. 'He didn't have any friends there.' Police got a call around 6:30 p.m. on . Friday that shots had been fired in a complex which houses 95 apartments . in Hialeah, just a few miles north of Miami. Police fill the street at the scene of a shooting which left seven people dead, including the gunman, at an apartment building in Hialeah, Florida . The . ordeal lasted eight hours, with Vargas running through the building, . firing at random and eluding officers for part of it, police said. The . situation started after Vargas set the fourth floor apartment, that he . shared with his mother, on fire with a combustible liquid by setting . ablaze a pile of cash. When property managers 68-year-old Samira and 78-year-old Italo . Pisciotti ran towards the apartment to see what was happening he shot them both. Vargas . then ran back into his burning apartment and fired 10 to 20 shots into . the street from a balcony, killing a third victim Carlos Javier . Gavilanes. The 33-year-old . father, who was at the apartment building across the street, had just . arrived home from work and was standing in the parking lot next to his . car when he was killed. Vargas then proceeded to run through the building, firing at random with a 9 mm pistol and eluding police. 'He kept running from us as he fired at us, and we fired at him,' said police spokesperson Carl Zogby. Police said he forced his way into an apartment and took two people hostage at gunpoint. A crisis team was able to briefly establish communication with Vargas. Sgt. Eddie Rodriguez said negotiators and a SWAT team tried talking with him from the other side of the door of the unit where he held the hostages. Miriam Valdes, 70, who lives on the building’s top floor said she heard about eight officers talking with him as she stayed holed up at the neighboring apartment. She said officers told him to 'let these people out.' 'We're going to help you,' she said they told him. She said the gunman first asked for his girlfriend and then his mother but refused to cooperate.Rodriguez said the talks eventually 'just fell apart.' Officers stormed the building, fatally shooting the gunman in an exchange of gunfire. Victim: At just 17 years old, Priscilla Perez was the youngest victim of the shooting rampage . Victim: Patricio Simono, 64, and his wife and daughter were three of the six victims of today's rampage shooting . Victim: Merly Niebles and her family lived below the gunman who fatally shot her, her husband and the couple's 17-year-old daughter . The building across the street where Carlos Javier Gavilanes was shot is called Casa Royal, or Royal House in English . 'They made the decision to go in there and save and rescue the hostages,' Rodriguez said. Both hostages survived. Neighbors said the shooter lived in the building with his mother. 'He was a good son,' said Ester Lazcano, who lived two doors down from the shooter. 'He'd take her in the morning to run errands' and took her to doctor appointments. But Valdes said he was known as a difficult person who sometimes got into fights and yelled at his mother. 'He was a very abusive person,' she said. 'He didn't have any friends there.' Both hostages survived when officers stormed the building, fatally shooting the gunman during an exchange of gunfire. ‘They made the decision to go in there and save and rescue the hostages,’ said Sgt. Eddie Rodriguez. Gunman Pedro Vargas started a fire in the apartment he shared with his mom on the fourth floor before he killed six innocent people . They were identified by their daughter Shamira Pisciotti, who told NBC6 that she heard shots and ran over to her parents' building, where she found her mom dead and her father clinging to life. 'My mom was dead the moment that she was shot and my dad still had a pulse when I got to him,' she said. Shamira Pisciotti said she believed that there had been a complaint about the shooter and that he confronted her parents about it, and that he then shot them. 'They got complaints from some neighbor that a situation was going on they went upstairs to do their duty as property managers,' Pisciotti’s fiancée, who did not want to be identified, told CBS Miami. Other witnesses describe hearing between 10 and 12 shots. Patricio was a handyman at the apartment complex and worked with the building managers. American Christian School principal Sergio Chavarri said Perez was a student at his school and would have gone into 11th grade this year. Perez, who wanted to be a nurse, never missed one day of class in the four years that she attended the school which takes pre-K through high school students, he said. 'She was a very nice person,' Chavarri said. 'We can't believe that such a nice person should be, you know, something like that.' Vargas lived in the building with his mother, police are still investigating his motive for the shooting spree . The shootings took place at this apartment complex in Hialeah, Florida on Friday evening and the early hours of Saturday morning . In Hialeah - a suburb of about 230,000 residents, about three-quarters of whom are Cuban or Cuban-American - the street in the quiet, apartment-building-lined neighborhood was still blocked by tape Saturday afternoon. The building where the standoff occurred is an aging, beige structure with an open terrace in the middle. The apartment where neighbors said the shooting started was charred, the door and ceiling immediately outside burned black. Rodriguez said police are still investigating the motive. ‘Investigators are talking with families of the victims, neighbors, people that were present when all this began,’ he said. ‘That way we can start to piece together this huge puzzle that we're working with.’ The fire was contained to Vargas’ apartment and his mom, who wasn't home at the time, is currently staying with relatives. Zogby called the whole building a crime scene. 'He probably fired dozens of shots during the whole incident,' he said. 'It could have been a much, much more dangerous situation.'

"Cannabis smokers in their 30s have lungs so badly damaged that they look like an 80 year old’s, doctors have warned. They say that young adults who have smoked cannabis for less than a decade are turning up at A&E with a severe, rapid and advanced form of the lung disease emphysema. Some are in their 30s and in some cases their lungs are so badly damaged that they are put on long-term oxygen therapy. Scroll down for video . Smokers of the drug in their 30s have lungs so badly damaged they are put on long-term oxygen therapy while one man is awaiting a lung transplant, a study of users in a rural region of north Wales concluded . One patient, studied in Ysbyty Gwynedd, a hospital in Bangor, north Wales, is waiting for a lung transplant, a British Thoracic Society conference heard. Emphysema, in which the millions of tiny air sacs in the lungs are gradually damaged, is normally caused by tobacco and usually occurs late in life. It is thought the cannabis-tobacco mixture found in joints is more damaging because they are often smoked without a filter. Cannabis smokers also tend to inhale for longer and much of the cannabis on sale today is much stronger than in the past. Dr Damian Mckeon, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Ysbyty Gwynedd, who studied eight patients who had smoked at least five joints a day, said: ‘We are seeing young people on the wards with the lungs of 80 year olds after less than a decade of smoking cannabis and tobacco. Young adults who have smoked cannabis for less than a decade are turning up at A&E with a severe, rapid and advanced form of the lung disease emphysema (pictured) ‘Our study was in a rural region of North Wales but we believe these cases may represent the tip of the iceberg. ‘Cannabis is far stronger these days and we are seeing the emergence of a new severe form of emphysema – which could lead to people struggling for breath for the rest of their life. ‘We urgently need a detailed study across the UK which analyses the national picture of cannabis-use and lung disease.’ Dr Bernard Higgins, of the British Thoracic Society, said: ‘This study is yet another small but persuasive piece of a jigsaw pointing to a real danger of regularly smoking joints. ‘The Government should monitor this emerging evidence carefully and take it into account when considering future drugs and smoking policy.’","Many, who are just in their 30s, are in need of long-term oxygen therapy .

"A PR representative for Valentino issued a press release crowing over A-list actress Amy Adams carrying a bag made by the designer label while attending the funeral of Philip Seymour Hoffman. The Valentino public relations executive Upasna Khosla emailed out a press release that read: 'We are pleased to announce Amy Adams carrying the Valentino Garavani Rockstud Duble bag from the Spring/Summer 2014 collection on Feb. 6 in New York.' It was accompanied by two pictures of a grieving Adams with her head down, wearing sunglasses and a sombre expression. Solemn occasion: Amy Adams, her Valentino bag and her husband Darren Le Gallo attend the wake for Philip Seymour Hoffman in Manhattan Friday . Adams, who recently broke down in tears while speaking to students on Inside the Actors Studio about working with Hoffman, is disgusted by the PR stunt. The actress' representative called the tasteless ploy 'truly appalling.' 'Amy Adams is not a paid spokesperson for Valentino and the suggestion she would use this moment to participate in a promotion is truly appalling,' the spokesperson told Page Six.

'We sincerely regret releasing a photo to the media this morning of Amy Adams with a Valentino bag,' said Valentino spokeswoman Mona Swanson.

There are missed opportunities and dim . prospects for a generation of mostly 20-somethings and 30-somethings . coming of age in a prolonged period of joblessness. 'Lost generation': The unemployment rate for young adults is the highest since World War Two (file picture) New 2010 census data released on Thursday showed the wrenching impact of a recession that officially ended in mid-2009. ‘We have a monster jobs problem, and young people are the biggest losers,’ said Andrew Sum, an economist and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. He noted for recent college graduates getting by on waitressing, bartending and odd jobs, they will have to compete with new graduates for entry-level career positions when the job market improves. ‘Their really high levels of underemployment and unemployment will haunt young people for at least another decade,’ Mr Sum said. Harvard University economist Richard Freeman said young people ‘will be scarred and they will be called the “lost generation”. ‘Their careers would not be the same way if we had avoided this economic disaster.’ The latest figures also show a rebound in the foreign-born population to 40 million, or 12.9 per cent, the highest share since 1920. The 1.4 million increase from 2009 was the biggest since the mid-decade housing boom and could fuel debate in this election season about immigration strategy. Car plants: Young males who lacked a college degree were most likely to lose jobs due to reduced demand for blue-collar jobs in construction, manufacturing and transportation during the downturn . Most immigrants continue to be low-skilled workers from Latin America, with growing numbers from Asia also arriving. An estimated 11.2 million people are in the U.S. illegally. People age 65 and older tended to return to or stay in their jobs, accounting for the few employment gains in recent months. 'We have a monster jobs problem, and young people are the biggest losers. Their really high levels of underemployment and unemployment will haunt young people for at least another decade' Andrew SumNortheastern University . About 1 in 6 older people is now in the labour force. That's the highest level since the 1960s, before more generous Social Security and Medicare benefits made it more attractive to retire. Employment among young adults 16-29 was 55.3 per cent, compared with 67.3 per cent in 2000. It's the lowest since the end of World War Two. Young males who lacked a college degree were most likely to lose jobs due to reduced demand for blue-collar jobs in construction, manufacturing and transportation during the downturn. Among teenagers, employment was less than 30 per cent. The employment-to-population ratio for all age groups from 2007-2010 dropped faster than for any similar period since the government began tracking the data in 1948. In the past year, 43 of the 50 largest . metropolitan areas continued to post declines in employment: Charlotte, . North Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Las Vegas, Phoenix, Los Angeles . and Detroit. Tough times ahead: For recent graduates getting by on waitressing, bartending and odd jobs, they will have to compete with new graduates for entry-level career positions when the job market improves (file picture) Each experienced a severe housing bust, budget deficit or meltdown in industries such as banking or manufacturing. Without work, young adults aren't starting careers and lives in new cities. Among adults 18-34, the share of . long-distance moves across state lines fell last year to roughly 3.2 . million people, or 4.4 per cent, the lowest level since World War Two. 'Are people just delaying births, or does this represent a real loss of babies that won't be replaced? During the Great Depression, there was a permanent loss of births - they were never made up' Kenneth Johnson University of New Hampshire . For college graduates, who historically are more likely to relocate out of state, long-distance moves dipped to 2.4 per cent. Opting to stay put, roughly 5.9 million Americans aged 25-34 last year lived with their parents, an increase of 25 per cent from before the recession. Driven by a record one in five young men who doubled up in households, men are now nearly twice as likely as women to live with their parents. Marriages fell to a record low last year of just 51.4 per cent among adults 18 and over, compared with 57 per cent in 2000. Among young adults 25-34, marriage was at 44.2 per cent, also a new low. Broken down by race and ethnicity, 31 per cent of young black men lived in their parents' homes, compared with 21 per cent of young Latino men and 15 per cent of young white men. At the state level, New York had the highest share of young men living with their parents at 21 per cent, followed by New Jersey and Hawaii - all states with higher costs of living. Pregnancy research: Births declined 6 per cent among 20-34 year-olds last year even though the number of women in this group increased by more than 1 million (file picture) Most of the cities with low percentages of young adults living at home were in the Midwest. Meanwhile, younger women from race and ethnic groups had fewer children compared with 2008. About 1 in 4 families with children is headed by single . mothers, a record. Among young families with a head of household younger than . 30, the poverty rate jumped from 30 per cent in 2007 to 37 per cent. In . contrast, poverty remained at a low 5.7 per cent for families with a head of . household 65 or older. The number of households receiving food stamps swelled by 2 . million to 13.6 million, meaning that nearly one in eight receives the government . aid. Among households receiving food stamps, more than half have children. Births declined 6 per cent among 20-34 year-olds last year even though the number of women in this group increased by more than 1 million, according to an analysis of census data by Kenneth Johnson. Mr Johnson is a sociology professor and senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire. Never before has such a drop in births occurred when the population of young adults increased in at least 15 years. ‘Are people just delaying births, or does this represent a real loss of babies that won't be replaced? During the Great Depression, there was a permanent loss of births - they were never made up,’ he said. Homeownership declined for a fourth consecutive year, to 65.4 per cent, following a peak of 67.3 per cent in 2006. ‘Many young adults are essentially postponing adulthood and all of the family responsibilities and extra costs that go along with it,’ said Mark Mather, of the private Population Reference Bureau. Not leaving: At the state level, New York had the highest share of young men living with their parents at 21 per cent, followed by New Jersey and Hawaii - all states with higher costs of living (file picture) He described a shift toward a new U.S. norm, one that's commonly seen in Europe, in which more people wait . until their 30s to leave the parental nest. ‘Some of these changes started before the recession but now they are accelerating, with effects on families that could be long term,’ Mr Mather said. The District of Columbia plus 14 states . had the largest ratios of college graduates to high-school dropouts - . more than three to one. 'Many young adults are essentially postponing adulthood and all of the family responsibilities and extra costs that go along with it. Some of these changes started before the recession but now they are accelerating, with effects on families that could be long term' Mark MatherPopulation Reference Bureau . Several of these places, including the District of Columbia and states with larger immigrant populations, had the widest income gaps between rich and poor. The number of Hispanic children in poverty rose by half a million to 6.1 million last year, making up a majority of the increase in total child poverty. Hispanics now comprise 37 per cent of children in poverty, compared with 30 per cent for whites and 27 per cent for blacks. ‘We are really at a crossroads,’ said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. ‘These new young immigrants and their children need a pathway to the middle class - good educations, affordable housing and jobs - at the same time federal and state budgets are strapped for funds. ‘While we face tough choices, the quality of our future labour force depends on meeting their needs.’ The 2010 numbers are from the American Community Survey, which queries 3 million households. In some cases the Current Population Survey was also used to establish historical trends.","Unemployment rate for young adults at highest level since World War Two .

"The waiting is over, the World Cup is finally here. But after 84 years, how much is really new? What can we expect that we have not seen in some form or other in football’s greatest competition? Here, Sportsmail lists 10 things you will - or might - see at this World Cup for the first time… . Scroll down for video . Best yet? This summer's tournament promises to be the most colourful and intriguing World Cup in history . 1) Signs that the Brazilians have stopped trying . There was a time, not so long ago, that a Brazilian footballer’s name carried with it mystique and meaning. Pele, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Socrates, Zico, Garrincha – the Little Bird. Flair by name and deed. Step forward the class of 2014, step forward Fred and, er, Bernard. There’s a chap named Victor on their bench as well. Truth be told, little Bernard is a real dazzler and is believed to be on the radars of Tottenham and Arsenal. If the name doesn’t get pulses racing, Shakhtar Donetsk’s £30m valuation might. Ear we go: Fred is set to lead Brazil's line when they kick off the tournament against Croatia . 2) Shaving foam on the pitch . It’s . 1974, Brazil have a free-kick 25 yards from Zaire’s goal. The referee’s . whistle blows and from the Zaire wall Mwepu Ilunga comes charging, . kicking away the stationary ball. Forty years later, the gently . simmering issue of encroachment might finally have been dealt with. Referees will use vanishing spray in the World Cup for the first time . this summer, drawing a foamy circle around the ball and a line 10 yards . away to keep that pesky wall at bay. We are informed the spray is . non-toxic, water-based and designed to fade from the pitch after a . minute. Making their mark: Referees will spray foam on the pitch to indicate how far defensive walls should retreat . 3) Big Head the turtle . There’s a turtle sanctuary north of Salvador where Big Head the loggerhead is channelling the cosmos (probably) to make predictions for each game. It’s a bit like that octopus in South Africa, but a turtle. The 25-year-old is predicting the results by choosing one of three fish, with a fish representing each of the teams in a given fixture and a third fish representing a draw. Big Head initially appeared to back Brazil-Croatia to end in a draw, but slowly turned away and crawled purposefully, menacingly to the Brazilian fish, which he devoured. Confident: Big Head the turtle says Brazil are going to win the World Cup . 4) Goal-line technology . Soon there will be nothing to gripe about or dissect and football can be at peace. This World Cup ought to signal the end of goal-line controversies. German company GoalControl has focussed seven high-speed cameras on each goalmouth from the roofs of all 12 stadiums. If a ball crosses the line, the referee's watch will vibrate and the word ‘GOAL’ will appear on his screen within a second. Within five seconds of this happening in an England match, TV pictures will cut away to Frank Lampard’s reaction. No goal: Mistakes such as the one which saw Frank Lampard's goal against Germany in 2010 not awarded should be a thing of the past with goal-line technology introduced . 5) England win a penalty shootout . In a world where turtles predict football results, stranger things have happened. However, the numbers actually indicate England are less likely to win a shootout in the World Cup than elsewhere, with all three of their previous attempts ending in defeat with a conversion rate of only 50 per cent (seven scored, seven missed). If you factor in the European Championships, where England beat Spain in 1996, England have won one of six shootouts, with a 68 per cent conversion rate (21 scored, 10 missed). This time, of course, they have Steve Peters strengthening the minds and training sessions where they have kicked penalties into open nets. Cue second-round pandemonium when England knock out Colombia on penalties and Joe Hart, dandruff free, holds Peters aloft, while players mimic their inner chimps in the background. Despair: Chris Waddle (right) is comforted by Lothar Matthaus after missing a penalty in England's defeat to West Germany in 1990 . 6) An African team reaches the semi-final. Maybe . It’s never happened before, with the quarter-finals previously claiming Cameroon (1990), Senegal (2002) and Ghana in 2010. The draw has not offered any glaring opportunities to do better this time, with only Ivory Coast in Group C and Nigeria in Group F holding realistic chances of progression from the first round. Nigeria might fancy their second-round chances against the winners or runners up of a modest Group E, while Ivory Coast would take on a side from England’s group. Super Eagles: Can Shola Ameobi (left) help inspire Nigeria in Brazil? 7) The world loves Belgium . Vincent Kompany, Thibaut Coutois, Jan Vertonghen, Daniel van Buyten, Eden Hazard etc. Belgium are no longer only the hipster’s choice. They have an easy group but will likely face either Germany or Cristiano Ronaldo in the second round. Red alert: Belgium are the outside bet of many punters . 8) A Wayne Rooney goal . Eight years after his first attempt, and four years after Nike’s ‘Write the Future’ campaign hinted he might end up in a caravan, Rooney is yet to do at a World Cup that thing strikers are meant to do. This time, with pressure and expectation at an all-time low, can he do it? Or is his move into a Lunar Quasar drawing closer? Mountain to climb: Wayne Rooney has never scored a goal at the World Cup finals . 9) The voice of reason . After England’s impressive run to the quarter-finals, the glow fades and radio debate analyses what went wrong. After some discussion on the merits of playing at least three passes in the control zone, it is quickly agreed that passion was the problem. Overpaid players don't want it enough. Passion play: Can Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney succeed where they have failed in previous tournaments? 10) Rio in Rio . Rio Ferdinand has made enough forays into television for his transition into pundit to be nothing too out of the ordinary. However, unlike Rio’s World Cup Wind-Ups, it’s unlikely that he’ll be teaming up with the Policia Ferderal to ‘Merk Nev’. He tweeted on Thursday that he will be kicking off his World Cup by watching Brazil-Croatia at the home of Fabio and Rafael. On the ball: Rio Ferdinand will be on the sofa as part of the BBC punditry team .","England will win a penalty shootout .
Wayne Rooney will finally score a World Cup goal .
And an African team will reach the semi-finals ."
"Shocking video footage of the moment a federal ranger shot dead a man on a lonely Nevada desert highway has been dubbed 'redneck justice'. Two horrified men watched in their car on Friday as the unsettling scene unfolded near the Red Rock Canyon Conservation area as a Bureau of Land Management ranger shot and killed D’Andre Berghardt Jr., 20. Giving a running commentary to their cellphone footage, the men exclaim, 'Oh my God, they just shot him' as the observe an unarmed Berghardt refuse to yield to officers and attempting to flee the scene - only to be killed as more than eight rounds are emptied into him. Scroll Down for Video: . Put your hands up: The two men who filmed the shocking episode initially stopped and saw D'Andre Berghardt being held at gunpoint on  state Route 159 near Calico Basin, Nevada . The video, obtained by the Las Vegas Review Journal is shot from a car parked on the road while the rangers deal with Berghardt. He had been hailing cyclists as he walked along state Route 159 near Calico Basin, more than 20 miles from Las Vegas. Two cyclists reported the man and rangers responded. Refusing to obey officers holding him at gunpoint, the two men began to film as the situation quickly became farcical. Indeed, several minutes into the stand-off, one ranger pepper sprays Berghardt, causing the 20-year-old to stumble and grab his face. However, the rangers do not seem in the video to attempt to cuff him. 'It’s really interesting that they haven’t just kind of grabbed him. I guess they really want him to be compliant before they (arrest him),' says the man filming. The other man replies, 'Yeah, it doesn’t look like he’s being very erratic. They should have just grabbed him.' Uncooperative: D'Andre Berghardt has still not complied with the rangers and one of them kicks out at him - but fails to follow it up with a cuffing . Following this, Berghardt rips off his shirt and turns his back on the officers and then suddenly is kicked in the back of the knee. Berghardt responds by throwing a punch at which point a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper arrives as he dashes behind a truck and out of the camera’s view. The video resumes with two rangers on top of Berghardt and the trooper standing to one side. At no point does it seem they attempt to cuff him. However, unruly Berghardt manages to escape their grasp and makes towards the trooper's patrol vehicle. 'Why don’t they just cuff him and be done with it?' one of the men in the video asks. 'You’d think,' the other replies. 'They keep letting him get up and run away.' Events take a tragic turn as Berghardt opens the door to the trooper's SUV and and climbs inside while the trooper closes the door on him. 'Dude, this guy’s going to end up getting shot,' one says as suddenly one of the rangers opens fire and appears to fire eight or nine shots inside the car. 'Dude, they just shot him. They just killed the dude. Holy (expletive). They just killed him. 'You know what’s ridiculous about this is, they never grabbed him. They could have grabbed him. They kept letting him get up.' Fleeing: D'Andre Berghardt makes to run away and is seen trying to get inside the troopers SUV . Law enforcement in Nevada have not commented on the case - however, the Las Vegas Review Journal reports that authorities claim Berghardt was attempting to grab the trooper's AR-15. Indeed, one of the men in the car does acknowledge the risk the officers were taking allowing the man to be in the SUV. 'They had him on the ground,' the other says. 'I don’t know why they didn’t just jump on him and pin him! 'You know, unless they thought he had something on him, but it didn’t look like it to me. 'It’s redneck justice.' Trooper Loy Hixson, a Highway Patrol spokesman, said Friday the officers 'felt their lives were in danger.' David Reed, 61, said he was in a truck close to the action and spoke to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Shots: More than eight shots can he heard ringing out as a ranger fires into the trooper's SUV after D'Andre Berghardt had managed to get inside . 'They tried and tried,' he said. 'I thought he was on drugs or something. He was that strong; he was throwing them around.' Berghardt is reported to have left his home in California to come to Las Vegas after an argument with his mother. Highway patrol officials have not yet responded to messages. The Clark County coroner said Mr Berghardt died of multiple gunshot wounds. The death was ruled a homicide. Bicyclists and joggers told reporters that Mr Berghardt had been seen walking on the paved shoulder of the highway with a rolling suitcase, a backpack and a bedroll.

"Experts claim that while an SPF cream (stock image) can stop the short-term effects of sunbathing, it allows enough rays through to cause potentially fatal disease in the long term . Wearing sun cream is not a reliable way to prevent getting skin . cancer, scientists have warned. A groundbreaking study into the way UV radiation attacks the . skin has revealed that long-lasting damage is not stopped by sunscreen. While an SPF cream can stop sunburn and the short-term . effects of sunbathing, it allows enough rays through to cause potentially fatal . disease in the long term. Anyone who spends more than a short time in the sun should . make sure they are covered up and should not rely on sunscreen alone, experts . warned. Scientists at Manchester University and London’s Institute . of Cancer Research carried out the world’s first molecular study into the way . malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is caused. Their paper, published in the journal . Nature, revealed that even highest grade SPF 50 suncream allows sufficient UV . radiation through to damage the DNA in the skin’s pigment cells. Dr Julie Sharp, of Cancer Research UK, which funded the . study, said: ‘People tend to think they’re invincible once they’ve put it on . and end up spending longer out in the sun, increasing their overall exposure to . UV rays. ‘This research adds important evidence showing that . sunscreen has a role, but that you shouldn’t just rely on this to protect your . skin.’ Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, . with more than 13,000 people diagnosed with the disease every year. The scientists found that sunscreen could not stop solar . radiation causing a mutation in the skin’s ‘guardian gene’ which produces . proteins that protect against UV. The researchers insisted people should continue to wear sunscreen, because while it does not provide complete protection, it can slow the cancer-causing effect of UV. But they said nobody should rely on sunscreen alone. Instead, people should also cover up when spending time in the sun (stock image) With the gene damaged, the skin is vulnerable to further . damage from the sun and more likely to develop a tumour. Study author Richard Marais, of Manchester University, said: . ‘UV light targets the very genes protecting us from its own damaging effects, . showing how dangerous this cancer-causing agent is. ‘Very importantly, this study provides proof that sunscreen . does not offer complete protection from the damaging effects of UV light.’ The research team examined the molecular effects of UV light . on the skin of 110 mice which had been genetically altered to be susceptible to . melanoma. They found that the use of SPF 50 sun cream would delay the . formation of tumours, but could not stop it altogether. Over a 15-month period they exposed the mice to weekly dose . of UV radiation similar to that a person would be receive to if they spent an . hour a week in a garden in southern England. The mice which did not have any protection each developed . tumours after an average of 5.3 months, and within seven months every single . one had the cancer. Another group of mice had their fur shaved and SPF50 . sunscreen applied. These mice developed tumours after an average of 7.5 months, . and each had grown melanoma within 15 months. Professor Marais insisted people should continue to wear . sunscreen, because while it does not provide complete protection, it can slow . the cancer-causing effect of UV. But he said nobody should rely on sunscreen alone to protect . them from skin cancer. He said: ‘This work highlights the importance of combining . sunscreen with other strategies to protect our skin, including wearing hats and . loose fitting clothing, and seeking shade when the sun is at its strongest.’ Professor Marais said the crucial finding is the impact of a . ‘guardian gene’ called P53, which normally helps protect from the effects of . damage caused by UV light. He said: ‘We found that sunscreen does work by limiting the . immediate effect of UV on the skin - it stops sunburn. ‘But sunscreen does not protect the skin completely - enough . UV light sneaks past to cause long term damage to the DNA. ‘The important thing is the impact on the P53 gene, which is . the guardian of the genome. Usually when you go out into the sun P53 activates the . release of protein which protects against UV. ‘But solar radiation knocks out the guardian, it targets the . very thing that defends the skin, and sunscreen cannot protect against that.’ The cosmetics industry insisted it had never . claimed sun cream could stop cancer. Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry . and Perfumery Association, said: ‘As cosmetic producers we never talk about . cancer in relation to the product - we cannot talk about protecting against or . stopping disease. ‘We never recommend that sun care products should be used to . stay out in the sun longer, only as part of ‘sun safe’ behaviour, which . includes staying out of the sun during the hottest part of the day, and . covering up. ‘We can’t use the term ‘sunblock’ or anything that suggest . there is 100 per cent protection. We can’t say total protection, the strongest . term we can use is ‘very high’ protection. ‘The first line of defence is to avoid sun, the second is to . cover up with a sunhat, T-shirt and trousers, and the third line of defence is . to use a sunscreen.’","Scientists from Manchester and London carried out the world’s first molecular study into the way .

He added: 'A fast train from Zurich came up behind us and brushed against the side of our RER. 'The Intercity service derailed.' Lars Fehr, 20, meanwhile told the Blick daily he had been sitting in the Rafz station waiting room when the crash occurred. Firefighters inspect the site of the train crash at Rafz station, a town 20 miles north of Zurich . Ambulances and police helicopters rushed to the scene and service on the train line between the towns of Bulach and Schaffhouse has been suspended . 'Suddenly there was a loud bang,' he told the paper, adding that both the trains had been heading in the same direction. Fehr said a woman had called the police and some people had headed out to the derailed train to help. 'The conductor got out of the locomotive, put on a safety vest and helped passengers out of the train,' he said. The Swiss are Europe's top rail users, and their network is normally envied abroad for safety and quality.","Crash happened early today at Rafz train station 20 miles north of Zurich .

"A 23-year-old Fairefield, Ohio resident was shot and killed on Saturday by a police officer called to regulate a fight between the 23-year-old and his father. Authorities say that the father and son scuffle started when Caleb Surface broke into his father Jeff Surface's house at the 2000 block of Spyglass Hill Court a little before 8pm. The pair began fighting physically and that's when Jeff called the police. WCPO reported that When police arrived, Caleb Surface ran out the back door and an officer met up with Caleb close by at the  2000 block of Saint Andrews Court. Caleb was shot by a police officer on Saturday just a week after he turned 23 years old . Caleb broke into his father's house at the 2000 block of Spyglass Hill Court just a little before 8 p.m. According to police, that's where an officer, whose name has not been released, fired two shots. Caleb died at the scene--exactly one week after his 23rd birthday on January 11. Surfaces body wasn't carried away from the scene by the Butler County Coroner's Office until 4:30 a.m., nine hours after the father called 911. Fairfied officer Doug Day said that Caleb Surface did not fire a shot at officer and is unsure as to what pushed his fellow officer to shoot the young man. It's unclear as to whether Caleb was armed or not but officer Day said that pointing a gun at an officer is enough to warrant shooting back. 'You display a weapon, you refuse our commands, you tell us you have a weapon, you make a furtive movement that makes us believe you're pulling a weapon at us, we will likely fire shots,' he said. WCPO reports that both Surface's father and his cousin Ed Kathman both believe that their son was unarmed the evening of the shooting. This a photo taken just two days before Caleb was shot dead by a police officer near his father's home . 'To the best of his father's knowledge, his son was unarmed, and that's what he told police,' Kathman said. He also said Surface 'didn’t take any weapons out of the house.' Surface's family say that he was 'a good kid' but that he struggled with drug addiction and was emotionally troubled. Status updates on Surface's facebook page indicate that he was struggling emotionally with feeling of helplessness and boredom. 'Some one save me from me please I just wanna blow my heqdnoff so bored!' wrote Caleb on January 16. He also wrote, 'What glimmers is sure to fade.' On the actual day of the shooting on January 18. Caleb wrote a prophetic poost reading, 'last words?' Chilling Prophecy: Caleb wrote 'Last Words?' on the same day that he died . Calebs friends and family say he was 'kind hearted' but that he struggled with drug addiction and depression . Even though Caleb wrote this on his facebook page he was believed to be unarmed during the time of the shooting . He even wrote, 'beer and a gun hmmm what to do.' Whether or not Caleb was armed is still not public knowledge. The immediate family said they will not comment on the shooting until the investigation is complete. 'The family expects a full and accurate accounting of what transpired from the time that Caleb left his father's home until his death a short time later,' the family's lawyer said. Caleb's cousin Ed Kathman said, 'It’s just an ongoing struggle with chemical dependency,' Kathman said. 'He was a good kid. He just struggled with drugs.' 'He was a good kid with a huge heart,' said Angie Kelley, Surface’s . aunt. 'He struggled with depression and he was unhappy. Life hasn’t been . easy on him lately,' she told the Dayton Daily News. The family has said that Caleb was 'kind hearted' and that his drug addiction overcame him. 'Will I sleep tonight that is the question,' Caleb wrote on his facebook on January 16 in an eerie foreshadowing. He turned 23 just a week before his death and seemed to be at a all time low. 'Drinking byyourself on your bday really isn't all that ,believe it or not' The police department is investigating the shooting and the officer who shot the boy, a 10-year veteran of the department, has been put on administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations and the Fairfield Police Department investigate.

"Between three and four billion years ago, changes in an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter hurled a devastating barrage of space rocks at our planet. Astronomers are only now beginning to understand the scale of the bombardment - analysing the impacts from tiny 'spherules' preserved in rocks today. Some of the asteroids were bigger than the 9-mile rock that wiped out the dinosaurs - but the 700-million-year barrage may have delivered chemicals crucial to the beginnings of life on our planet. Astronomers are only now beginning to understand the scale of the bombardment - analysing the regularity and size of the impacts from tiny 'spherules' preserved in rocks today . Researchers are learning details about asteroid impacts going back to the Earth's early history by using a new method for extracting precise information from tiny 'spherules' embedded in layers of rock . ‘What we have done is provide the . foundation for understanding how to interpret the layers in terms of the . size and velocity of the asteroid that made them,’ said Jay Melosh, . professor of earth and atmospheric sciences, physics and aerospace . engineering at Purdue University. 'This is the first real solid evidence that this asteroid bombardment . actually happened,’ Melosh said. ‘Some of the asteroids that we infer . were about 25 miles in diameter, much larger than the one that . killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago. But Melosh and his team believe that the bombardment may have delivered chemicals crucial to the evolution of life on our planet. The study also seems to show that the bombardment lasted far longer than previous estimates, which suggested the 'Late Heavy Bombardment' lasted roughly half as long as Melosh's team estimates. 'But when we looked at the number of impactors as a function . of size, we got a curve that showed a lot more small objects than large . ones, a pattern that matches exactly the distribution of sizes in the . asteroid belt. For the first time we have a direct connection between . the crater size distribution on the ancient Earth and the sizes of . asteroids out in space.’ Melosh and his team use 'spherules' - tiny markings in rocks - to work out the scale of the asteroid bombardment. The spherules were created when asteroids crashed into the Earth, vaporizing rock that expanded into space as a giant vapor plume. Small droplets of molten and vaporized rock in the plume condensed and solidified, falling back to Earth as a thin layer. The round or oblong particles were preserved in layers of rock, and now researchers have analyzed them to record precise information about asteroids impacting Earth from 3.5 billion to 35 million years ago. The period of heavy asteroid bombardment - from 4.2 to 3.5 billion years ago - is thought to have been influenced by changes in the early solar system that altered the trajectory of objects in an asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter, sending them on a collision course with Earth. Meteor Crater in Northern Arizona: Some of the asteroids were bigger than the 9-mile rock that wiped out the dinosaurs - but the barrage continued for up to 700 million years, as an entire asteroid belt 'emptied' itself at our planetBecause craters are difficult to study directly, impact history must be inferred either by observations of asteroids that periodically pass near the Earth or by studying craters on the moon. Now, the new technique using spherules offers a far more accurate alternative to chronicle asteroid impacts on Earth, Melosh said. ‘We can look at these spherules, see how thick the layer is, how big the spherules are, and we can infer the size and velocity of the asteroid,’ Melosh said. ‘We can go back to the earliest era in the history of the Earth and infer the population of asteroids impacting the planet.’ For asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers in diameter, the spherules are deposited in a global layer. ‘Some of these impacts were several times larger than the Chicxulub impact that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago,’ Johnson said. ‘The impacts may have played a large role in the history of life. The large number of impacts may have helped simple life by introducing organics and other important materials at a time when life on Earth was just taking hold.’ A 40-kilometer asteroid would have wiped out everything on the Earth's surface, whereas the one that struck 65 million years ago killed only land animals weighing more than around 20 kilograms. ‘Impact craters are the most obvious indication of asteroid impacts, but craters on Earth are quickly obscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonic processes,’ Johnson said. ‘However, the spherule layers, if preserved in the geologic record, provide information about an impact even when the source crater cannot be found.’ The Purdue researchers studied the spherules using computer models that harness mathematical equations developed originally to calculate the condensation of vapor. ‘There have been some new wrinkles in vapor condensation modeling that motivated us to do this work, and we were the first to apply it to asteroid impacts,’ Melosh said. The spherules are about a millimeter in diameter. The researchers also are studying a different type of artifact similar to spherules but found only near the original impact site. Whereas the globally distributed spherules come from the condensing vaporized rock, these ‘melt droplets’ are from rock that's been melted and not completely vaporized. ‘Before this work, it was not possible to distinguish between these two types of formations,’ Melosh said. ‘Nobody had established criteria for discriminating between them, and we've done that now.’ One of the authors of the Southwest Research Institute paper, David Minton, is now an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Purdue. Findings from the research may enable Melosh's team to enhance an asteroid impact effects calculator he developed to estimate what would happen if asteroids of various sizes were to hit the Earth. The calculator, ‘Impact: Earth!’ allows anyone to calculate potential comet or asteroid damage based on the object's mass.","Findings from analysis of tiny 'spherules' in present-day rocks .

"For any Premier League club looking to rebuild on the cheap this summer, there are a few bargains to be had. Not every close-season addition must come at club-record expense or be prised from a rival. The advent of the Bosman ruling has seen the market flooded with free agents in recent years, the temptation to bring in a new face at no cost proving an attractive proposition for would-be suitors. This summer is no different. Here, Sportsmail runs you through our free-transfer XI (formation: 4-3-3). Free trade: Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole could both be up for grabs this summer . Goalkeeper: Brad Friedel (Spurs) He’s getting on – he’ll turn 43 on Sunday – but there are a few saves left in the American’s glovebag yet. Until the arrival of Hugo Lloris at White Hart Lane in 2012, he had played every minute of the previous eight Premier League seasons. He only made six starts in all competitions this time around but would still make an able deputy for a top-flight club in need of an experienced head and reliable pair of hands. Right back: Bacary Sagna (Arsenal) Named in France’s provisional World Cup squad, Sagna will be one of the most sought-after frees this summer. Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea are all circling and the absence of a transfer fee should see his £100,000-per-week wage demands satisfied. Something for nothing: North London rivals Brad Friedel and Bacary Sagna are out of contract this summer . Centre back: Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United) Unceremoniously dumped after 12 years at Old Trafford, he will have no shortage of admirers over the coming months. Former United defender Steve Bruce, now in charge of Hull, has already hinted that Ferdinand’s number is on speed-dial and the 35-year-old will want a starting role having been a spectator for much of United’s calamitous campaign. Centre back: Joleon Lescott (Manchester City) Just five years ago Lescott was a £22m England player on his way to the Etihad as City’s rapid rebuild gathered pace. Two Premier League winner's medals later and he is heading for the exit door having made eight appearances this season. Lescott is still just 31 and, given he satisfies the homegrown quota, could well attract interest from a top-six club. United: Manchester defensive pair Rio Ferdinand and Joleon Lescott have been released . Left back: Ashley Cole (Chelsea) Snubbed by England, Cole will not feel so unwanted when the scramble for his signature begins. He is perhaps the prize pick of all the players up for grabs this summer and there is an argument to say he remains one of the best left-backs in the Premier League. Left midfield: Patrice Evra (Manchester United) After eight seasons at Old Trafford - and five Premier League titles - Evra will be moving on this summer. He's still good enough to warrant a place in the France squad and, given his 33 league outings for United this season, there are still plenty of miles in the tank. It wouldn't be a surprise to see him back in the Champions League next year. Available: Left backs Ashley Cole and Patrice Evra (who is in our midfield) will have no shortage of suitors . Central midfield: Frank Lampard (Chelsea) The 35-year-old is the only member of England’s World Cup squad who could leave on a free during the close-season and, were he to serve a reminder of his talent at the finals, it could well trigger a race for his services. He appeared 26 times for Chelsea in the league this season – scoring six times – and would remain a dependable presence at the heart of any midfield. Right midfield: Joe Cole (West Ham) His return to West Ham has not, it is fair to reflect, been a success. Nonetheless, there will no doubt be one top-flight club willing to take a punt on the former England forward. In it together: Ex-West Ham, Chelsea and England stars Frank Lampard and Joe Cole face uncertain futures . Striker: Shola Ameobi (Newcastle) He may have scored just three goals this season but Ameobi will be an attractive proposition for promoted clubs in the market for an experienced target man. He has made north of 23 league appearances in each of the last four campaigns and, should he shine at the World Cup with Nigeria, will not be short of interested parties. Striker: Nicklas Bendtner (Arsenal) After nine years in North London – and not a single trophy - the Dane will finally bid a not-so-fond farewell to the Gunners. He will no doubt talk of a transfer tussle between Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the likelihood is that a mid-table Premier League club could be the setting for his rehabilitation. Forward thinking: Shola Ameobi and Nicklas Bendtner could attract interest from Premier League newcomers . Striker: Samuel Eto’o (Chelsea) Nine goals from 16 league starts is a fair return but, it appears, not fair enough for Jose Mourinho. The Cameroon striker will be released this summer and the lure of his name – not to mention his goal threat – should be enough to persuade one top-flight admirer to meet his wage demands. On target: Samuel Eto'o scored nine league goals for Chelsea this season .","Out-of-contract stars set to spark transfer tussle this summer .

"Arsenal go into their Champions League clash with Anderlecht facing a goalkeeping crisis with untested Emiliano Martinez set to be thrown in at the deep end. The Gunners are without first choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny due to suspension following his red card against Galatasaray and second choice David Ospina is out with a thigh injury. Third choice Martinez trained with the rest of his teammates ahead of the trip to Belgium alongside three other untried keepers.

Huddart was the Arsenal youth team goalkeeper last season and now features for the Under 21s on a frequent basis. He signed for Arsenal from Charlton and has England honours at schoolboy level and is expected to get the nod to start on the bench. Vickers has spent the last two campaigns in Arsenal's youth team squad and finished 2013-14 on loan at Ryman Premier League side Canvey Island. He was able to participate in Arsenal's run to the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup last season, where they were knocked out by eventual winners Chelsea. And Macey went straight into the Under 21 squad following a successful trial about a year ago that persuaded the Gunners to sign him from Bristol Rovers. He started 15 games for the U21 side and travelled with the first team squad for their pre-season training camp in Austria over the summer. So far in the Champions League Arsenal have beaten Galatasaray but lost to Borussia Dortmund and have three points from a possible six.

Bayern's stars celebrate their famous victory in front of their travelling support at the final whistle . Manchester United 7 Roma 1 . Quarter-final, second leg - April 2007 . Tuesday night was not the first time Roma have suffered in Europe's premier club competition. They were humiliated by Manchester United in the last eight back in 2007, one of the English club's most emphatic performances on the continental stage. Sir Alex Ferguson's team were trailing 2-1 from the first leg in Italy but soon cancelled out that deficit with goals inside the opening 20 minutes from Michael Carrick, Alan Smith and Wayne Rooney. With Old Trafford euphoric, Cristiano Ronaldo's double either side of half-time settled the contest before a Carrick stunner and a late Patrice Evra strike completed the rout.

Bayern may have dealt out a footballing lesson this time but they were on the end of a hiding last season. The defending European champions only trailed Real by one goal following the first leg in Madrid and were confident of overturning the deficit on their own turf. It didn't go according to plan. Sergio Ramos scored two headers inside the opening 20 minutes to put clear daylight between the two teams before Gareth Bale set Cristiano Ronaldo racing clear to slot home the third. The Portuguese then curled a free-kick under a jumping Bayern wall to round off a sensational performance. Real would go on to end their long wait for a 10th European crown.

Liverpool 4 Real Madrid 0 . Last 16, second leg - March 2009 . Perhaps this glorious Anfield European night is an omen for Wednesday's meeting. Fernando Torres produced an exhilarating display to guide Rafa Benitez's men to a famous victory. The Spain striker had only just returned from injury but gave Liverpool the lead after 16 minutes when he turned in Dirk Kuyt's cross. Former Manchester United defender Gabriel Heinze was then penalised for handball and Steven Gerrard slotted home the penalty. The captain then fired home his second of the evening shortly after the break before Andrea Dossena rounded off a classy win late on.

Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 . Group stage - November 1994 . United ran into Johan Cryuff's 'Dream Team' at precisely the wrong time. Battered 4-0 by AC Milan in the previous season's final (see below), Barca had a lot to prove. The first group game at Old Trafford ended a 2-2 draw - Hughes and Lee Sharpe scoring for United, Romario and Jose Mari Bakero for Barca. In the return the following month, the wonderful forward pairing of Hristo Stoitchkov and Romario were superb on the night, ripping apart a United side robbed of goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel due to the limit on foreign players. Stoitchkov (2), Romario and Albert Ferrer all found a way past Gary Walsh and his bewildered backline. Romario (left) fires his team's second goal past Manchester United's Steve Bruce (right) and Gary Pallister . AC Milan 4 Barcelona 0 . Final - May 1994 . The Milan coach Fabio Capello revelled in a 'perfect night' as his team tore Cryuff's mighty Barcelona team apart in Athens. With Romario, Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman in their ranks, Barca started as favourites but Milan were in command at half-time thanks to a double from Daniele Massaro. Further goals from Dejan Savicevic and Marcel Desailly early in the second period rounded off the largest win in a Champions League final. Capello, reflecting on that night, said: 'Everyone at the time thought Barcelona were the best team and that they were impossible to beat. This was a motivation for my players.' Marcel Desailly celebrates scoring AC Milan's fourth goal in their destruction of Barcelona . Borussia Dortmund 4 Real Madrid 1 . Semi-final, first leg - April 2013 . Robert Lewandowski produced a striker's masterclass, scoring all four goals as underdogs Borussia Dortmund thrashed Real at a delirious Westfalenstadion. The Poland frontman volleyed in a Mario Gotze cross to give the Bundesliga side the lead, but Cristiano Ronaldo equalised. Lewandowski then scored twice in the space of five minutes to put Dortmund in firm control and then coverted a fourth from the spot after Marco Reus had been fouled. Real won the second leg 2-0 but it was insufficient to overturn the deficit inflicted by rampant Lewandowski.

The French maestro opened the scoring midway through the first half but Inter equalised through a deflected Christian Vieri strike. The Gunners seized control after the break, restoring their lead through Freddie Ljungberg before Henry made sure of the win with a fabulous individual effort. Edu made it four before Robert Pires rounded things off late on. 'Not in my wildest dreams could we have predicted that sort of result,' Wenger said afterwards.

AC Milan 4 Arsenal 0 . Last 16, first leg - February 2012 . The Gunners returned to the San Siro nine years later for a knockout tie with AC Milan and were on the receiving end of a thrashing. They trailed to a superb goal from Kevin-Prince Boateng on 15 minutes and a double from Brazilian star Robinho put Milan firmly in command. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's penalty with 11 minutes remaining consigned Arsenal to their heaviest European defeat. Incredibly, the Gunners nearly overturned the deficit at the Emirates. They scored three times in the first half of the return but couldn't find a fourth. Kevin-Prince Boateng lashes in Milan's opening goal in their 4-0 win over Arsenal in 2012 .

A result that signalled the shift of power from Spain to Germany - for one season at least. Jupp Heynckes' side had just been confirmed Bundesliga champions in record time and produced a sensational performance at the Allianz Arena to take a firm grip on the tie. Thomas Muller's goal book-ended the four-goal rout, with Mario Gomez and Arjen Robben scoring in between. Bayern underlined their superiority by winning the return in the Nou Camp 3-0 and went on to beat Borussia Dortmund in the final at Wembley. Mario Gomez finishes from close range to put Bayern Munich two goals up against Barcelona in 2013 . Arjen Robben also scored during the four-goal rout, which set Bayern on course for the final . Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 . Quarter-final, second leg - April 2010 . Lionel Messi produced one of his finest performances for Barcelona as they came from behind to thrash Arsenal in the Nou Camp. The Gunners had hauled themselves back from two goals down in the home leg and incredibly went ahead of aggregate in Catalonia when Nicklas Bendtner scored. Magical Messi then took control, driving home an equaliser before taking in Pedro's pass to add a second. He capped off a first-half hat-trick with a stylish lob and then scored a fourth late on with a trademark individual effort. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"A badly ill toddler's life was saved thanks to a replica of her heart made with a 3D printer. Two-year-old Mina Khan was born with a hole in the wall between two chambers of her heart which left her struggling to survive. Exhausted from pumping blood around the hole, which was initially feared too big to treat, she was left breathless and couldn't eat - even her hair wouldn't grow. Thriving at last: Two-year-old Mina Khan was born with a hole in the wall between two chambers of her heart but surgeons were able to fix it thanks to a 3D facsimile of the organ printed in plastic . But after doctors at St Thomas' Hospital in London created a precise copy of her tiny heart, including its defect, they were able to perfect the complicated procedure needed to cure Mina. It meant when surgeons finally operated on the tiny girl they knew exactly what they were looking for and what to do when they found out. 'Mina is like a normal little girl now,' her mother Natasha Buckley, from Bury, Greater Manchester, told Sunday Times science editor Jonathan Leake. 'She is eating, has stopped being sick and is growing at last.' Mina was born with a heart so deformed that doctors said it could not be repaired. With a hole between her ventricles, the two pumps that circulate blood to the heart and the lungs, she was left constantly tired, sickly and unable to put on weight, her mother told the Sunday Times. Her only hope was for surgeons to try to patch the hole, but toddlers' hearts are so small that even the most experienced paedatric heart specialists find them difficult to handle, making any operation risky. But thanks to the 3D model of her heart, based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography scans, surgeons were able to design a bespoke patch and understand how it needed to be stitched into place. Pioneering technique: Dr Gerald Greil, who has pioneered the use of the 3D-printing technique at St Thomas', said the model he and colleagues created helped them tailor the Gore-Tex patch stitched into Mina's heart . Professor David Anderson led the operating team. He told the Sunday Times Mina had a 'very complex' hole in her heart - the kind of case that can pose a 'huge intellectual challenge'. 'The 3D printing meant we could create a model of her heart and then see the inside of it with a replica of the hole as it looked when the heart was pumping,' he said. 'We could go into the operation with a much better idea of what we would find.' Dr Gerald Greil, who has pioneered the use of the 3D-printing technique at St Thomas', said the model he and colleagues created also helped them tailor the Gore-Tex patch stitched into Mina's heart. The use of 3D-printed 'practice organs' made to measure from MRI scans of patients promises to become an important surgical tool in coming years. The process has featured in America and surgeons at a New York hospital created a 3D heart that saved the life of a two-week-old baby. And in Southampton an entrepreneur with a 3D printing services company persuaded doctors to let him help them by making a model of his own kidney when he needed an operation to remove a kidney stone. Medics say having the plastic kidney slashed an hour from his two-hour kidney stone removal operation earlier this month and the hospital is now trialling the process with 21 other patients. Surgeon Bhaskar Somani, of Southampton General Hospital, said: It makes our job easier going in. 'The 3D model helps because it gives us a rough estimation of where to come from and to be more precise.'","Mina Khan was born with a hole between two chambers of her heart .

"Half of a dozen popular small cars tested for how they would stand up to a crash did not fare well, an influential road safety group found. Six of the cars tested, most of which were 2013 models, were rated ‘poor’ or ‘marginal.’ General Motors Co's Chevrolet Sonic and Cruze each received marginal scores, while Kia Motors Corp's Soul and 2014 Forte were rated ‘poor’ in the results released Thursday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Nissan Motor Co's Sentra also got a poor rating, while Volkswagen AG's Beetle was ranked ‘marginal.’ Scroll down for crash test video . Smashed: Six of the 12 small cars tested by Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, most of which were 2013 models, were rated 'poor' or 'marginal,' among them Kia Soul (pictured) Intense: As part of the test, small vehicles were crashed at 40 mph into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver's side . Worst-case scenario: In cars that did not score well, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy's head hit the instrument panel . Two redesigned Honda Civic models, the 2-door and the 4-door, were the only small cars to get the top rating in stringent front-end crash tests performed by the insurance industry group. In the worst cases with the small cars that did not score well, safety cages collapsed, driver airbags moved sideways and the crash dummy's head hit the instrument panel, and side curtain airbags did not deploy or provide enough protection, IIHS chief research officer David Zuby said. Of the 12 models tested, the Kia Forte fared the worst, the institute said in a press release. Its seat belt allowed too much slack, and the side curtain airbag deployed but didn’t provide enough protection. The crash dummy’s head hit the windshield pillar and instrument panel. In the test of the VW Beetle, the steering column moved nearly 5 inches to the right as the test dummy’s upper body moved forward and to the left. ‘The rotation meant that the dummy’s head barely contacted the front airbag,’ the institute reported. ‘At the same time, the safety belt spooled out too much, allowing the dummy to move forward 13 inches and hit its head on the dashboard. The side airbag didn’t deploy.’ By comparison, the Civics sustained only minimal intrusion into the occupant compartment, providing ‘survival space for the dummy,’ which remained well-protected from impact. The IIHS increased the rigor of its tests last year to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle. The insurance group said nearly a fourth of U.S. front-of-vehicle crashes that result in serious injury or death involve only a single corner that strikes another vehicle or an object like a tree or utility pole. The IIHS continues to score vehicles on side, rear, rollover and front-end crashes that impact more than just a corner. Failing grade: Nissan Sentra received a 'poor' rating based on its performance in the crash test . Biggest loser: Of the 12 models tested, Kia Forte fared the worst because its seat belt allowed too much slack, and the side curtain airbag deployed but didn't provide enough protection . ‘This is a challenging new crash test and it's not surprising that some vehicles are earning marginal and poor ratings,’ IIHS spokesman Russ Radar said of the small overlap front crash test. ‘This crash scenario doesn't lend itself to a Band-Aid fix so for most manufacturers the countermeasure will have to be built in when there's a full redesign,’ he added. Vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. market often design and engineer their models to score well on IIHS safety tests and use the results in their marketing. ‘It matters because in today's world cars are so competitive that all you need is a small flaw and your competition can exploit it,’ Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said. Good/acceptable ratings:Honda Civic 4-doorHonda Civic 2-doorDodge DartFord FocusHyundai ElantraScion tC (2014) Marginal/poor ratings:Chevrolet SonicVolkswagen BeetleChevrolet CruzeNissan SentraKia SoulKia Forte (2014) Most of the 12 small cars tested were already in production before the IIHS increased the rigor of its front crash test last year. However, Radar said IIHS alerted the companies to the work the group was doing on small overlap research in 2009. The specifications of the test were not finalized until the last year, which is late in a car's development process, Brauer said. All automakers will eventually redesign their cars to meet the standards to pass the new crash test, he said. In the tests, IIHS crashes a vehicle at 40 mph into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver's side that overlaps one-quarter of the vehicle's width. Kia pointed out that the IIHS small overlap crash test goes well beyond federal requirements and the group has recognized numerous Kia vehicles as top safety picks. The South Korean automaker said it would evaluate the results carefully, but the company was proud of its safety record. GM said customer safety remains its highest priority and it is committed to its cars performing well in all types of crashes. ‘We are aggressively working to incorporate these into our models, including our small cars like the Chevrolet Sonic and Cruze, where technically feasible,’ GM spokeswoman Sharon Basel said in an email. Nissan and VW said they were proud of their cars' safety records in federal crash tests and other IIHS crash tests, but they would review the small overlap test results and incorporate what is learned into future designs. Top of the list: Two redesigned Honda Civic models, the 2-door and the 4-door, were the only small cars to get the top rating . Passing grade: 2013 Dodge Dart received an acceptable rating in the test . Aced it: Both the 2-door and 4-door models of Honda Civic excelled in the IIHS test . The small car segment was the fourth group of cars rated using this new test, and most of the groups have fared equally badly. Last summer, seven of 11 luxury sedans evaluated rated ‘marginal’ or ‘poor,’ and 12 of 15 small SUVs tested also failed to score well in results released in May. Family sedans scored the best, with only five of 18 scoring ‘marginal’ or ‘poor’ in results released last December. As a group, the small cars fared worse than the mid-sized family sedans, but better than the small SUVs, IIHS said. Results on the new crash test for mini-cars will be released later this year. The other six small cars tested included two- and four-door versions of Honda Motor Co Ltd's Civic, which both received ‘good’ ratings. The Civic was tested earlier this year and the results were released in March. Receiving ‘acceptable’ ratings were Chrysler's Dodge Dart, Ford Motor Co's Focus, Hyundai Motor Co's Elantra and Toyota Motor Corp's 2014 Scion tC. Upping the ante: The IIHS increased the rigor of its tests last year to include crashes that involve only a front corner of a vehicle . Dangerous: In the models that did not do well on the test, side curtain airbags did not deploy or provide enough protection . The Civic (pictured) was tested earlier this year and the results were released in March . All the cars scoring well received ‘Top Safety Pick +’ ratings by the insurance trade group. Vehicles earning the institute's award have received ‘good’ ratings in the four traditional tests plus ’good’ or ‘acceptable’ ratings in the small overlap test. IIHS said it did not test the Toyota Corolla because the automaker plans to release a redesigned 2014 model this month. The market for small cars is one of fastest-growing in the U.S. Automakers have made the cars quieter and more refined as people who want good gas mileage turn to compacts and subcompacts. So far this year, Americans have bought more than 1.8million new small cars, up 12 per cent over a year ago, according to Autodata Corp. ‘Manufacturers need to focus on the whole package,"" David Zuby, the Institute's chief research officer, said in a statement. ‘That means a strong occupant compartment that resists the kinds of intrusion we see in a frontal crash like this, safety belts that prevent a driver from pitching too far forward and side curtain air bags to cushion a head at risk of hitting the dashboard or window frame.’","Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashed small vehicles at 40 mph into a 5-foot-high barrier on the driver's side .

"A Utah woman who was the driver in a crash that killed her husband has been given the go-ahead to sue herself for negligence. The bizarre legal situation arose after Barbara Bagley, as representative of her dead husband's estate, filed papers suing herself as the driver, in order to claim damages against the insurance company. The December 27, 2011, accident occurred on Interstate 80 near Battle Mountain, about 225 miles east of Reno. It was reported at the time she suffered a concussion, broken ribs, a shattered wrist and two punctured lungs, while her husband Brad Vom Baur was initially taken to hospital in critical condition before succumbing to his injuries. Barbara Bagley, seen here two months after her devastating crash in 2012, was badly injured. Her dog Dooley spent 53 days surviving in the wilderness, living off roadkill before he was found . According to court documents, Bagley as the estate representative seeks unspecified amount of damages for medical expenses, loss of financial support and the loss of her husband's love and companionship, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. The claim was initially denied by a district judge in January 2014, only for it to be overruled on appeal. Lawyers representing her in her capacity as estate representative said she was suing herself because legally, she had to act to benefit the estate. But those representing her in her own capacity as the driver said: 'If this suit is allowed to continue, a jury would be asked to determine whether Barbara Bagley's fault caused Barbara Bagley's own harm,' the paper reported. Bagley's husband Brad Vom Baur (left) died in the crash. Bagley (right) is suing herself in an attempt to win compensation from her insurance company . 'The jury would be asked to determine how much money will fairly compensate Barbara Bagley for the harm she caused herself. The jury will be highly confused - it cannot order a person to compensate herself.' The accident itself made headlines in 2012 because the couple's Shetland sheepdog Dooley - in the car at the time of the crash - escaped unscathed, but spent 53 days surviving on roadkill and water sources before being found. At the time, she said: 'I would think about Dooley constantly,' she said. 'There were TV commercials with dogs that made me think about him and cry. He's just the sweetest dog.' The search for Dooley was cancelled before it began after the January 6 discovery of what appeared to be the dog's remains along the interstate. The same day, her husband died. 'It was a horrible day for me,' Ms Bagley recalled. 'But something inside me told me Dooley was still alive out there. I wasn't 100 per cent sure, but I didn't grieve for Dooley like I did for my husband and our other dog.' However, after several searched, a friend finally spotted Dooley and managed to coax him into his Jeep. Dog and owner were reunited after 53 days.","Barbara Bagley is suing herself as the driver of crash that killed husband .

"This week marks the 70th anniversary since the first U.S. air force officer was killed in Europe after America entered World War Two. Just a scattering of plaques are all that remain of the headquarters of the U.S. Army Air Force in Bushy Park, west London, built in 1942. There is no memorial to Lieutenant Colonel Townsend Griffiss, who became the first of 30,000 U.S. air force personnel to die in the European theatre. Footnote: Lieutenant Colonel Townsend Griffiss was killed on February 15, 1942, after his B-24 Liberator was shot down over the English Channel . Historic: A plaque at the site of Camp Griffiss, named after Lt Col Griffiss, in Bushy Park, west London . The 41-year-old was killed on February 15, 1942, after he was shot down by friendly fighters in a B-24 Liberator which failed to identify itself as it flew over the English Channel, an article in the BBC's online magazine has revealed. A high-flying officer, Lt Col Griffiss was flying back to Britain from Cairo, Egypt, but despite getting Air Ministry approval for the flight after an operation initially in Moscow, Russia, there were conflicting responses from RAF Transport Command and the British Overseas Airways Company which owned the unarmed B-24. As the aircraft passed over St Malo, northern France, it appeared on British radar screens and two Spitfires were sent to intercept it. Investigations into what happened revealed one pilot saw a bright flash from one of the B-24's turrets and he reported that the aircraft began to dive into cloud. Tributes: The USAF memorial in Bushy Park. Now a royal park, it was the location of the U.S. Air Force headquarters in Britain in 1942 . War: The former blocks of Camp Griffiss were demolished in the 1960s . Comrades: The dedication stone at the memorial. Lt Col Griffiss was shot down by friendly forces after his Liberator failed to identify itself as it flew over the Channel . Both Spitfires, from a Polish Air Force squadron based in Exeter, opened fire and the Liberator's right engine was hit as it began to go down. The pilots reported a large patch of oil and disturbed water and searched later found bags of diplomatic mail and a leather bag belonging to Griffiss. The investigation failed to discover why the aircraft was not identified as friendly, but the B-24 Liberator was relatively unknown at the time and one of the pilots admitted he had mistaken the plane for a German Focke-Wulf 200. Lt Col Griffiss, originally from the Coronado suburb of San Diego, California, was an expert on war observation who was sent to Europe during the Spanish civil war in the 1930s. In May 1941, he was sent to London as part of a special observer group (Spobs) as the U.S. began to consider its involvement in World War Two. But in November that year, he was sent to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet government for the opening of a Siberian supply route. Final journey: The B-24 Liberator had set off from Cairo to Britain and was unarmed, but confusion over the flight meant a Spitfire fighter squadron had not been told it was expected . Investigation: The Liberator was shot down and crashed into the English Channel, with a leather bag belonging to Lt Col Griffiss recovered from the sea . After failing to get anywhere, he flew from Kuibyshev - the temporary wartime capital after German forces reached Moscow - to Tehran, then to Cairo and it was on his flight to Britain that he was killed. Air traffic controllers who knew the Liberator would be arriving from northern France on Febuary 15 were reprimanded for not informing the Exeter fighter sector. The two pilots, Stanislaw Brzeski and Jan Malinowski, were blamed and recommended for court martial - although this was later dropped because of insufficient evidence. The court of inquiry said: 'In view of the important personages carried in civil aircraft, more attention should be paid to the identification of civil aircraft.' America entered World War Two after Japan launched its infamous strike on Pearl Harbour on December 7, 1941. Camp Griffiss, named after Lt Col Griffiss, is now the location of a royal park and none of the original blocks still stands. The air force officer also had an air base in the U.S. named in his honour, now Griffiss International Airport in Rome, New York State.

"Click HERE to check out all the key statistics as West Ham secured back-to-back wins at Turf Moor on Saturday . Sam Allardyce is usually a white wine man but, on the eve of his 60th birthday, the West Ham manager won’t mind knocking back these Clarets. Allardyce certainly has plenty to celebrate after this win. Not only are his team flying high in the Premier League table after a fourth Premier League win in eight games, they have reached those heights playing a brand of football not readily associated with him during his time in charge at Bolton and Blackburn down the road from Turf Moor. Victory here did not come easily in a hugely entertaining game, however. Burnley raised hopes of their first win of the season during a first half in which Kieran Trippier and George Boyd were outstanding. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Diafra Sakho rises highest to give the Hammers the lead against Burnley at Turf Moor . Sakho, who scored his sixth goal in as many games at Turf Moor, wheels away after giving West Ham the lead . Mark Noble celebrates wildly with Sakho after the Senegal forward gave West Ham the lead . Aaron Cresswell is understandably delighted after seeing West Ham make it 1-0 at Burnley courtesy of Sakho . Adrian rejoices after seeing West Ham take the lead after the interval at Turf Moor . Burnley: Heaton 5.5; Trippier 7.5, Duff 5, Shackell 5, Mee 6; Kightly 6.5 (Chalobar 83), Arfield 5.5, Jones 6, Boyd 7.5; Jutkiewicz 6 (Barnes 65, 6), Ings 6.5 (Sordell 83).

Subs not used: Vaz Te, Jarvis, Jaaskelainen, O’Brien, Burke. Scorers: Sakho 49, Valencia 54, Cole 70 . Booked: Reid . Referee: Kevin Friend 7 . Star man: Diafra Sakho . But two goals in five minutes after the break from Diafra Safro – with his sixth in as many games – and Enner Valencia put Allardyce’s team in control. Boyd pulled one back but substitute Carlton Cole’s header made sure that Allardyce will have a very happy birthday on Sunday. He said: ‘I told the players before the game, “come on lads, I need a result because it’s my birthday and if we don’t get one it’s not going to be very pleasing even though I’m out with my old mates tonight”. ‘We’re only eight games in and I just hope it continues. If we’re in the top half in December, we can think about maintaining that for the rest of the season.’ Burnley had last season’s 26-goal top scorer Danny Ings back after a three-game absence to liven up their goal-starved attack – just four in eight league games now – and it certainly appeared to have the desired effect as they twice went close to taking the lead within the first eight minutes. There were less than two minutes on the clock when Trippier’s cross took a deflection off Aaron Cresswell and looped up towards Boyd just inside the box. In one motion, the former Hull player took the ball on his chest and away from James Collins before letting fly with a first-time volley which beat goalkeeper Adrian but came back off the underside of the bar. Then Lukas Jutkiewicz thought he had scored his first goal of the season when he tapped home close-range after Ings’s jinking run and low shot had brought a one-handed save from Adrian, but the big Burnley striker was clearly a couple of yards offside and it did not count. The Clarets continued to press with Trippier a constant threat down the right, and it was from another of his crosses that Jutkiewicz headed narrowly over under pressure from Collins. It was a similar story in the 29th minute when Jutkiewicz headed over after great work on the right by Boyd, but this time he had Michael Kightly arriving unmarked at the far post behind him and the winger’s frustration was plain to see. Burnley’s enterprise and energy kept West Ham pinned in their own half for long periods, but the visitors did go close twice in the space of five minutes with Stewart Downing involved on both occasions. Enner Valencia makes the perfect connection from Carl Jenkinson's cross to double the Hammers lead .

Downing is revelling in the free role he has been given by Allardyce this season, and it was his cross from the right in the 25th minute that created a great chance for in-form Sakho but the Senegal striker somehow planted is header wide at the near post under pressure from Jason Shackell. Then Downing popped up on the other wing and stepped inside Shackell before trying his luck from a tight angle with a curling effort that clipped Tom Heaton’s far post. There was always a chance that Burnley would live to regret not taking their chances, and so it proved as West Ham struck twice in the space of five minutes after the interval. Both goals came from fantastic crosses from their fullbacks, and both were wonderfully despatched by Sakho and Valencia. Sakho’s was his sixth in as many games as he arrived ahead of Shackell to meet Cresswell’s cross from the left and power a header past Heaton in the 49th minute. ‘He’s a bargain and if the transfer fee was £4.5million, with all the top-ups it’s still a bargain,’ said Allardyce. ‘This lad has been very exciting and he’s excited the rest of the players.’ A red flare landed on the pitch in the celebrations that followed, thrown from the West Ham fans behind the goal, and the smoke had only just cleared when they were applauding a second. Alex Song made a surging run upfield and fed Carl Jenkinson, and his equally good ball from the right picked out Valencia who rose above Michael Duff to head home. That should have knocked the stuffing out of Burnley. Instead it was the trigger for a stirring fightback.

Kightly’s delivery was held up in the wind and Adrian made a mess of catching it under pressure from Ings, allowing Boyd to fire home in the scramble that followed. Ings was inches away from equalising moments later when he met another wonderful cross from Trippier with a header that flew wide, but West Ham finally made sure with a third goal in the 70th minute. Burnley boss Sean Dyche said: ‘It’s a harsh reality in the Premier League that you have to take your chances.’ Cole’s header was not quite as impressive as the others as he got in ahead of Heaton to nod home from close-range after Sahko had turned Downing’s corner back across goal, and there was still time for substitute Ashley Barnes to hit the bar for Burnley, but Big Sam won’t be complaining as he enjoys that glass of wine.

"With the World Cup coming to a close, excitement in building for the new Premier League season. Here, MailSport looks at the top targets for every top-flight club: . Nice goalkeeper David Ospina is a £4million target with Norwich’s John Ruddy an alternative. Sami Khedira's £23m move seems imminent, which may see a £23m move for Leverkusen’s Lars Bender put on the backburner. Southampton right back Calum Chambers is wanted. Brazil shop window: David Ospina is fancied by Arsenal and could move for around £4million from Nice . Paul Lambert likes Troy Deeney at Watford but they want at least £7m. Free agent Esteban Cambiasso is a midfield option but has other interest too while Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles will cost £6m at least. Two offers made for Deeney. Boss Sean Dyche has bid also £1.5m for Middlesbrough’s Lukas Jutkiewicz,  while West Brom defender Craig Dawson wants to join but Albion are reluctant to sell. Jose Mourinho was confident of persuading Sami Khedira to join from Real Madrid for £20m but the player seems to favour Arsenal. Left back Filipe Luis should join from Atletico Madrid for £18m. Trump card could be the return of Didier Drogba on a free. World star: Chelsea liked the look of Sami Khedira but the Germany midfielder looks set for a move to Arsenal . Tony Pulis hopes to snatch Steven Caulker of Cardiff from QPR’s grasp for £8m. Talks are ongoing with his clubmate Fraizer Campbell for £750,000. Pulis is a fan of Jonjo Shelvey but Swansea want at least £9m for the midfielder. Roberto Martinez wants Romelu Lukaku to return from Chelsea but Wolfsburg are rivals. He may try for Demba Ba and Monaco’s Lacina Traore on loan again. He is in talks with Ferencvaros over midfielder Muhamed Besic. Options: Everton like the look of two Chelsea strikers, Demba Ba and recent loanee Romelu Lukaku . Steve Bruce wants a centre back but Tottenham's Michael Dawson wants to stay in London. Bruce has bid for Dundee United’s much-coveted 20-year-old left back Andy Robertson. Chelsea's central defender Kenneth Omeruo, 20, is among many other options. A striker is top of Nigel Pearson’s agenda. Leicester have offered up to £7m for Leonardo Ulloa but Brighton want £10m. Connor Wickham, revived at Sunderland, and QPR’s Charlie Austin are alternatives. Jay Rodriguez of Southampton is fancied as Swansea’s price for Wilfried Bony is rated too high. Loic Remy of QPR is a possibility. Dejan Lovren of Southampton, Ben Davies (Swansea) and Ryan Bertrand (Chelsea) are targets. Keen: Liverpool want to add centre half Dejan Lovren to their ex-Southampton contingent . VIDEO Koeman hopefuly that Lovren will stay . Talks are ongoing with £32m Eliaquim Mangala of Porto but he may choose Chelsea or Manchester United, so Mehdi Benatia of Roma is an option. Yaya Toure worries may spark a bid for Paul Pogba of Juventus. Louis van Gaal wants three defenders. Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels and Arsenal’s Thomas Vermaelen are targets. They have signed Montpellier midfielder Remy Cabella for £12m. Feyenoord right back Daryl Janmaat has arrived on Tyneside for a medical ahead of a £5m move. Striker Emmanuel Riviere of Monaco will cost £6m . En route to the Premier League: Midfielder Remy Cabella has joined Newcastle for around £12million . Rio Ferdinand is due for more talks this week ahead of a free transfer. A bid of £5m has been rejected by Ajax for striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson. If Steven Caulker joins Palace, QPR may try for Spurs’ Michael Dawson. Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry could form part of the deal that takes Calum Chambers to the Emirates. Ronald Koeman also likes Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk and Fraser Forster, and Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall. Bojan Krkic of Barcelona - who was on loan at Ajax last season - is the kind of marquee signing Mark Hughes is desperate to make. Norwich’s Nathan Redmond has been discussed but is expensive at £6m while Stuttgart striker Vedad Ibisevic is a possibility. European recruitment: Mark Hughes likes the look of Bojan Krkic and has made him his top target . Gus Poyet wants Jack Rodwell but faces competition from half of the Premier League in wanting to loan the midfielder. Sunderland have asked about QPR’s Charlie Austin and bid for Marcos Alonso at Fiorentina. Swansea have asked about Troy Deeney, agreed a £4m fee with Monarcas Morelia for Jefferson Montero and are keen to loan Nick Powell from Manchester United. Bosnian midfielder Anel Hadzic has also been discussed. Tottenham want Wilfried Bony of Swansea for £19m after being rebuffed over Romelu Lukaku. They are also keen on Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton, Swansea’s Ben Davies and Toulouse full back Serge Aurier. Target: Jack Rodwell is attracting the attention of a large group of clubs, including West Brom and Sunderland . Alan Irvine wants to take Jack Rodwell from Manchester City but only on loan. He has agreed to take Andre Wisdom on loan from Liverpool while, at £3m, Bournemouth striker Matt Ritchie is a cheaper option. They want to agree a fee for Enner Valencia of Pachuca and have asked Young Boys about Michael Frey.

"The Good Life in Shrewsbury has been recognised by the Observer Food awards - but found itself the subject of scathing reviews . Despite its local reputation as a great place to eat, last autumn The Good Life was struggling to attract outside custom. Profits even fell by a quarter as visitors to Shrewsbury apparently opted to steer clear of the vegetarian restaurant - despite it being awarded a runner-up medal in the Observer Food awards. They had perhaps been put off by a series of online reviews, such as one on TripAdvisor that said: 'Staff cold and unattentive. The vegan option wasn't vegan. There were hairs in my quiche.' Or they may have read one of about 30 similar postings that appeared on similar review sites. But . it has emerged that all the disparaging reviews were part of a personal . vendetta against the Good Life's owner, Joanna Langfield, 40 - by a . woman who had never even been to the restaurant. In . an apology published in The Times yesterday, Helen Griffiths, a marketing manager . from Salford, admitted 'misrepresenting the quality of the food and . service of the restaurant which, from other reviews and nominations, . does indicate an exemplary track record. She added: 'I made these comments based on . absolutely no knowledge of the business, or any of the company's staff, . as I have never actually visited or eaten at the restaurant.' It is believed that the apology, which would have cost just under £1,000, was a condition of Ms Griffiths' police caution for harassment. She is married to Ms Langfield's former . partner. The attack started after Ms Langfield became involved in a . legal dispute with Mr Griffiths in August. 'It started off quite extreme. Someone posted a review calling me ""arrogant"" and making other nasty . references. TripAdvisor actually took that one down.' Henriette Graham serves a customer in The Good Life restaurant, which became the subject of malicious false reviews on various websites . Helen Griffiths posted malicious reviews of The Good Life on TripAdvisor and other sites. They have since been removed . The apology from Helen Griffiths printed in The Times yesterday . Bad reviews then began appearing on a number of websites, with Ms Griffiths each time using different names. Initial attempts by Ms Langfield herself and then Shrewsbury police to have TripAdvisor remove the posts failed. The US-based company did not respond to any letters sent until they set  up a dedicated  UK customer  service operation. A . spokesman said: 'Every single report of suspicious content undergoes a . full investigation by our content integrity team and if a review is . found in breach of our guidelines, it will absolutely be removed from . the site.' Ms Griffiths was tracked down thanks to the help of a man who ran one of the sites on which she posted. He gave police the IP address was linked to Warrington - where Ms Griffiths worked. As a result of the malicious campaign The Good Life's profits slumped by 25 per cent. Ms . Langfield said: 'Before Christmas we got a statement from our . accountant showing an unusual dip. It was a really distressing . situation. I felt powerless to stop it.' An . investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority concluded the . declaration was misleading as the website, which has around 50 million . users' comments, cannot guarantee they are all genuine. One of Ms Griffiths' reviews said there were hairs in her quiche at the Good Life restaurant . The ruling came after complaints about the authenticity of reviews on the world's biggest travel site, with accusations that some businesses and even guests were putting up fake comments. TripAdvisor has faced claims that some establishments are being given poor write-ups by rivals to boost their own trade. While, malicious customers have even tried to blackmail small hotels with threats to post negative reviews. A spokesman for TripAdvisor said: 'We have confidence the 50million users who come to our site every month trust the reviews they read, which is why they keep coming back.' Earlier . this month TripAdvisor was told to change the wording on its website, which claims it offers 'trusted and honest' reviews. The Good Life is down a quiet pedestrian street in the heart of Shrewsbury . TripAdvisor has been accused of carrying false reviews from hotels looking to boost custom . A VITAL TOOL FOR TRAVELLERS . Researchers last year claimed to have come up with a way of spotting fake reviews on travel websites such as TripAdvisor. By studying the language of bogus recommendations they identified how companies fool the public into thinking their hotels and resorts are above par. A direct mention of the place where somebody stayed is a dead giveaway, as is the heavy use of 'I' and 'we'. Adverts which include lots of adverbs like 'really' and 'very' should be suspect, along with exclamation marks which denote false enthusiasm. A focus on who the person was with, such as a husband or family, should also alert travellers they are being duped, the scientists said. The research was commissioned after it emerged that hotels in Britain and abroad are bribing guests to write glowing reviews on website like TripAdvisor in exchange for cash or cut-price rooms and meals. The researchers from Cornell University in the U.S. tackled the problem of what they dubbed 'deceptive opinion spam' by asking freelance writers to produce 400 fake reviews of Chicago hotels and post them on review websites. They then mixed in 400 real reviews of the same hotels and asked three judges to try and tell them apart - but they were unable to do so. The team then developed an algorithm which was able to spot a fake 90 per cent of the time.","Woman launched campaign of hate against husband's former partner, who owned The Good Life restaurant ."
"Michael Jackson tattooed his lips pink, permanently inked his eyebrows and relied on a dark tattoo to blend his hairline into his wig, according to an autopsy report given in a Los Angeles court yesterday. As the high profile trial of the singer's tour promoter, AEG, continues, a disturbing photograph of the fallen pop star's corpse was shown to the court on Monday by Dr Christopher Rogers. His coroner's report described a man whose struggle to hide a skin pigmentation disease forced him to mask his true features but who would have lived a long life had he not overdosed on propofol. Face paint: A disturbing autopsy photograph of the singer, not released, was shown in court yesterday revealing that he tattooed his lips, his eyebrows and his hairline as seen here in older photos . The revelation of Jackson's permanent . make-up comes during the trial brought by the singer's mother . and children who claim AEG shares blame in his death for neglecting to . vet and supervise Mr Jackon's doctor, Dr Conrad Murray. The firm, which was organising Jackson's planned comeback concerts in London, claims it was not responsible for the star's decision to employ Conrad Murray as his doctor. Dr Rogers confirmed from his autopsy that Jackson's skin became lighter in the 1980s owing to 'vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disease.' He added: 'So some areas of the skin appear light and others appear dark.' The doctor also confirmed that an overdose of propofol killed the pop star although several other types of sedative administered by Murray the same morning contributed to his death. Expert: Medical examiner, Dr Christopher Rogers testified during Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial in October 2011 and appeared in court again yesterday in the trial brought by the Jacksons against concert promoter AEG . Michael Koskoff, a lawyer for . Katherine Jackson, asked the deputy medical examiner for Los Angeles . County: 'Would a fit, competent doctor administer propofol for . insomnia?' 'I would not expect that, no,' Dr Rogers responded. Guilty: Dr. Conrad Murray was sentenced to four years for administering a fatal does of propofol to the singer to help him sleep . Los Angeles coroner's toxicologist Dan . Anderson, also testified on Monday that the level of propofol in Jackon's body was 'consistent with major surgery anesthesia.' Propofol, a sedative used in operations and even executions, was allegedly taken so often by Jackson that he referred to it as 'milk'. Mr Anderson told the court: 'It raises a red flag in my eyes. It's very problematic to find it outside the hospital setting.' He went on to explain how when propofol is administered to a patient, a number of staff should be on hand equipped with sophisticated medical devices to intervene if the patient stops breathing. Faced with suggestions that the singer gave himself the lethal dose of propofol, Dr Rogers countered: '...based on the history that was available, I don't believe that that happened.' Furthermore, he testified, were it not for the lethal dose of the drug, the pop star's overall health would have promised him a normal lifespan. With no signs of addiction to street drugs, or any heart disease that some have insinuated triggered his death, 'there was no indication from the autopsy that there was anything anatomically wrong with him that would lead to premature death,' Dr Rogers said. CNN noted the importance of Dr Rogers' testimony in calculating Mr Jackson's expected lifespan as it would relate to damages. If he had not passed, the fact that the pop star would have continued to make billions of dollars will affect the number the Jackson family expect. AEG continue to argue that the singer chose Dr Murray as his tour medic and the company had no way of knowing what he was giving Jackson to sleep at night.","Autopsy revealed how the singer also tattooed his lips pink and suffered from a skin pigmentation disease since the 1980s .
